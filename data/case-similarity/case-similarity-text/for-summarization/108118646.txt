Patna in CWJC No.6612 of 1996 (Exhibit 2/2) it is evident that as the learned
counsel for the petitioner did not want to press the aforesaid writ petition,
whereupon was dismissed. However, it was opined during course thereof
"Dismissal of this writ petition will, however, not preclude the petitioner
from approaching any other forum available under law Patna High Court FA No.12
of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  36/36 for redressal of his grievance". Civil court has
not properly been identified. It happens to be administrative forum and so,
the superior official than that of Collector would have been appellate
authority, more particularly, the Commissioner, though not identified under
the circular of Jawahar Rojgar Yojana but the "Practice and Procedure Manual"
could come in rescue.
16\. Consequent thereupon, the judgment impugned suffers from inherent defects
and is accordingly set aside.
17\. The appeal is allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the
case there shall be no order as to cost.

JUSTICE ADITYA KUMAR TRIVEDI C.A.V. JUDGMENT Date : 07-08-2020 Being aggrieved
by and dissatisfied with the judgment dated 14.08.2003 and decree dated
27.08.2003 passed by the learned Sub-Judge-VIII, East Champaran at Motihari in
Title Suit No.107 of 1998/174 of 2002, whereby and whereunder the suit has
been decreed on contest with cost, the defendant-appellants challenged the
same by way of instant appeal. Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020
2/36 It looks wise to address the parties by their original status as they
stood before the learned lower court.
2\. Briefly stated the case of the parties are as follows:
Respondent-plaintiff asking for the relief that on an adjudication of the
facts and circumstances the order of the defendants be declared illegal,
improper, arbitrary, whereby the order to stop with the work of allotted
tender as well as for recovery of Rs.50,000/- so paid as an advance amount, a
decree for Rs.3,00,000/- with proper interest be passed till realisation of
the amount in lieu of expenses so incurred during course of purchase of
construction materials as well as, expenses incurred in digging plinth,
removal of accumulated water, construction up to plinth as per work order
issued by the defendants in his favour, injuncting the defendants permanently
from allotting the construction work of bridge over Tilawe river to somebody
else, any other relief or reliefs which the plaintiff is entitled for and for
that, pleaded that the plaintiff happens to be a member of All India Centre
for Urban and Rural Development (NGO) having with district office at Miscot,
Motihari, East Champaran who coming to know about the proposal for
construction of R.C.C. bridge over Tilawe river near Fular village, advanced
his candidature. After technical sanction at the end of the Executive
Engineer, N.R.E., Motihari (defendant Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  3/36 no.5) on the basis of which, the administrative sanction
of Rs.4,99,500/4,99,800/- was granted by the Deputy Development Commissioner
(defendant no.2) vide letter no.1584 dated 01.10.1994. Subsequently thereof,
the request of the plaintiff was acceded with. Whereupon, he was appointed as
an agent by the Block Development Officer, Turkauliya vide letter dated
3/4.10.1994 and as directed, the plaintiff executed an agreement on 04.10.1994
which was accepted by the Block Development Officer, Turkauliya on the same
day. After consulting the Collector, issued work order and, further
instructed, to start work on war footing after investing at his end as, at
that very moment fund was not available. It was assured at the end of the
Block Development Officer, Turkauliya that as soon as fund will be made
available, payment will be made to him. On that very assurance, the plaintiff
took out Rs.1,17,000/- from his Savings Account No.960 lying at Kshetriya
Gramin Bank, Harsidhi as well as also took loan from his close relatives,
friends and then, initiated the work. In due course of time, fund came.
Whereupon, on 28.10.1994, the Block Development Officer, Turkauliya granted
Rs.50,000/- as an advance. For the purpose of construction of the bridge, the
plaintiff brought 300 bags of cement, 4000 cft. stone chips, 4000 cft. Sone
sand, bricks worth of Rs.50,000/- and had Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  4/36 also spent Rs.20,000/- in dewatering the area as well as
Rs.15,000/- in plinth digging and Rs.40,000/- as carriage expenses.
While the work was going on, he became very much surprised on receiving an
instruction on 27.11.1994 from the Block Development Officer, Turkauliya to
stop the construction work in pursuance of the order dated 23.11.1994 followed
with 26.11.1994 passed by the Collector, East Champaran. The aforesaid event
is found duly recorded in Misc. File No.01/1994-95.
It has further been disclosed that the plaintiff had already requested the
Block Development Officer, Banjariya on 19.11.1994 to visit the site in order
to verify the construction work and, there should be entrustment to Assistant
Engineer as well as Junior Engineer for supervising the casting work as well
as to measure the work already completed. Then, it has been pleaded that the
order of the Collector was passed on a complaint made by some unscrupulous
persons without visiting the spot and taking a look over the construction work
having been completed, abruptly directed to stop the further construction and,
to deposit Rs.50,000/-
paid to the plaintiff as an advance.
It has further been averred that in a meeting of 20-Point Programme held on
01.12.1994, the issue came up for discussion and, it was finally resolved that
a committee consisting of local Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  5/36 M.P., local MLA and the Collector would enquire into the
matter followed with necessary order. In pursuance of resolution of the Block
Development Officer, the local MLA, Ramashray Singh held physical enquiry on
02.12.1994 and submitted his report on 05.12.1995 substantiating the plea of
the plaintiff over investment as well as majority of construction work having
so completed.
Then thereafter, the plaintiff had also filed a representation before the
Collector, East Champaran at Motihari on 31.01.1995 which was not at all
considered up to March, 1995 on the pretext of Assembly Election even then,
the same has not been considered.
Lastly, against the aforesaid order dated 23.11.1994 CWJC No.4205 of 1995 was
filed at the end of the plaintiff which was allowed vide order dated
26.02.1996, remitting the matter to the Collector, East Champaran at Motihari
for fresh consideration after setting aside the order dated 26.11.1994. It has
also been averred that during the pendency of CWJC No.4205 of 1995, the
Collector, East Champaran at Motihari directed Shri K.M. Ram, Executive
Magistrate, Motihari to inspect and report who, accordingly held enquiry into
the matter and submitted his report on 13.07.1995 justifying the claim of the
plaintiff
3\. After having remanded the matter to the Collector, East Champaran at
Motihari by the High Court while allowing Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  6/36 CWJC No.4205 of 1995, Misc. Case No.04 of 1996 has been
drawn up and, the learned Collector proceeded therewith. It is apparent that
the matter was decided vide order dated 18.05.1996 whereby and whereunder, the
Collector raised propriety of technical sanction granted to the aforesaid
scheme and for that, he held the Block Development Officer, Banjariya as well
as the Executive Engineer responsible, conjointly. On the other hand, the
plaintiff has been directed to produce all the materials before the District
Rural Agency, Motihari which was instructed to purchase those items. Then, it
has been stated that against the aforesaid order CWJC No.6612 of 1996 was
filed at the end of the plaintiff which was dismissed vide order dated
07.01.1998 directing the plaintiff to approach any other forum available under
the law for the redressal of his grievance. Accordingly, the suit has been
filed with the relief as stated hereinabove after completing other legal
formality. It is further evident from the order-sheet that plaintiff was
exempted from filing the court fee as well as was also waived to comply with
the mandatory obligation as provided under Section 80(1) of the CPC.
4\. Appellants/defendants have appeared and filed conjoint written statement
whereunder, apart from raising ornamental objection, status of the plaintiff
has also been shaken. Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  7/36
There happens to be strong resistance on account of non-
compliance of Section 80 of the CPC. It is also evident from the written
statement that some sort of clandestine atmosphere has been exposed and to
justify the same, it has been averred that over Tilawe river construction of
bridge was to be constructed and for that, estimate was prepared of
Rs.7,68,100/- and the most surprising feature is that the Deputy Development
Commissioner who was not at all competent enough to grant sanction for more
than Rs.5,00,000/-, got it bifurcated in two parts and then granted
administrative sanction though comprising of total estimated amount of Rs.
7,68,100/- but in two parts on the same day.
It has further been averred that the Commissioner was the competent authority
to grant administrative sanction exceeding Rs.5,00,000/- and, the Deputy
Development Commissioner was not at all competent to bifurcate the estimated
amount and in likewise manner, for technical sanction, the Executive Engineer
was competent enough only up to Rs.5,00,000/- and above that, the
Superintending Engineer was the competent authority.
It has then been submitted that the story at the end of the plaintiff
regarding instruction given by the Block Development Officer, Banjariya to
start work on war footing after managing the financial source at his own level
after getting instruction from the Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  8/36 Collector are palpably false. It has been admitted that
although advance of Rs.50,000/- was granted on 28.10.1994 by the then Block
Development Officer, Banjariya, however, the nomination of plaintiff as an
agent should have been at the end of the Deputy Development Commissioner which
never materialised.
It has further been disclosed that on a complaint made by Dr. Faizul Alam, Ex.
MP of the area on 14.11.1994, found irregularity, whereupon, ordered to stop
the further construction.
It has further been stated that the aforesaid work was being done under
Jawahar Rojgar Yojana whereunder, the Collector is the competent authority to
check the irregularity and, is administratively competent enough to direct to
stop the work.
It has further been pleaded that the plaintiff succeeded in managing the whole
affairs, persuading the then Block Development Officer, Turkauliya, Banjariya
and Deputy Development Commissioner who in order to favour the plaintiff
illegally in order to procure illegal gain, indulged in such kind of activity
contrary to the circular guiding the Jawahar Rojgar Yojana. Whereupon, the
plaintiff is not at all entitled for the relief so sought for.
Then it has been submitted that the plaintiff falsely and incorrectly averred
with regard to storage of construction materials Patna High Court FA No.12 of
2004 dt.07-08-2020  9/36 at the site during course of which he incurred
expenses of Rs.3,00,000/-.
It has further been pleaded that the order of the Collector is just, legal and
proper and has been passed as per the circular commanding the scheme under
Jawahar Rojgar Yojana. So, submitted that suit be dismissed with cost.
5\. The learned lower court after analysing the pleading of the respective
parties framed the following issues:
> (1) Whether the plaintiff is entitled Rs. 3 lakhs with interest from
> October, 1994 to the defendants as alleged in the plaint?
> (2) Whether defendants illegally, erroneously, improperly, arbitrarily
> recovering the advance money of Rs.50,000/- from the plaintiffs as alleged
> in the plaint?
> (3) Whether the suit as framed is not maintainable?
> (4) Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file present suit?
> (5) Whether suit is bad for non-compliance of notice of Section 80 CPC?
> (6) To what relief or reliefs, if any for which plaintiff is entitled ?
Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  10/36 (7) Whether suit is hit
by provisions of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel?
(8) Whether suit is hit by provisions of Contract Act?
(9) Whether suit is hit by Section 34 of Specific Relief Act?
(10) Whether suit is undervalued and court fee paid is insufficient?
(11) Whether plaintiff not deserved for exemption of court fee as alleged in
W.S. para 7?
And decided the same in favour of the plaintiff and against defendants, hence
this appeal.
6\. Altogether 10 PWs have been examined on behalf of the plaintiff who are
PW-1(Banka Singh), PW-2 (Ram Pujan Dubey), PW-3 (Basudeo Sah), PW-4 (Dina Nath
Mishra), PW-5 (Ravindra Pratap Singh), PW-6 (Rajeshwar Prasad), PW-7 (Suresh
Prasad), PW-8 (Ram Chandra Singh), PW-9 (Anil Kumar) and PW-10 (Om Prakash
Kumar).
7\. The learned Additional Advocate General No.13 while challenging the
judgment impugned has urged that from very perusal of the judgment, it is
evident that the learned lower court has passed the same in a mechanical
manner without considering the if and buts so prevailing. In order to justify
his Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  11/36 submission, it has
been submitted that under issue no.5, the plea of applicability of Section 80
of the CPC has been dealt with and, from perusal of paragraph 18, it is
evident that the learned lower court had not applied its judicial mind rather
based its opinion in the background of order dated 11.11.1998, whereby and
whereunder compliance of Section 80 of the CPC has been stifled though, the
learned lower court should have considered whether there was urgency to such
extent justifying the waiver of compliance of Section 80(1) of the CPC.
8\. In likewise manner, it has also been submitted that from the documents
exhibited on behalf of the respondent-plaintiff itself the illegal activity is
found duly exposed which, the learned lower court completely ignored. Not only
this, the respondent-
plaintiff while examining himself as PW-8 admitted lapses so committed the
circular guiding implementation of Jawahar Rojgar Yojana and, the learned
lower court while considering issue nos.1 and 2, should have properly
scrutinized the relevant documents, circular in consonance with admission of
PW-8, the respondent-
plaintiff.
9\. Furthermore, the learned lower court failed to consider that the
authorities who were not competent to accord sanction (either administrative
or technical) in consonance with the Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  12/36 respondent-plaintiff created forged document in order to
give illegal benefit to the respondent-plaintiff including they themselves,
which has completely been given a go by, while delivering the judgment
impugned by the lower court.
Consequent thereupon, the finding so recorded by the learned lower court is
fit to be set aside.
10\. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-plaintiff while
refuting the submission so advanced at the end of learned counsel for the
appellant-defendants, has submitted that the finding recorded by the learned
lower court is just, legal and proper. In order to justify such submission, it
has been argued that the status of respondent-plaintiff as one of the member
of the N.G.O. is found admitted. With regard to construction of a bridge over
river Tilawe near Fulwar village an initiative taken up at the end of the
appellant-defendants is also not denied. The nomination of respondent-
plaintiff as an agent is also admitted. Execution of agreement is also
admitted. The administrative sanction as well as technical sanction granted by
the authorities concerned are also admitted. Storage of construction materials
at the site as well as initiation of work though challenged, but is found duly
substantiated at the end of the respondent-plaintiff corroborated by different
reports having at the Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  13/36
end of appellants/defendants and so, on account of illegal order passed by the
Collector forbidding the respondent-plaintiff to proceed with the construction
work furthermore causing huge loss to the respondent-plaintiff did justify the
finding so arrived at, at the end of the learned lower court.
11\. Then, it has been submitted that so far the non-
compliance of Section 80 of the CPC is concerned, the court has been empowered
to waive in case of urgency and the order dated
11.l1.1998 did speak justifying the case of urgency. Therefore, waiving of
compliance of section 80 of the CPC is found as per mandate of law as
prescribed under Section 80(2) of the CPC.
Consequent thereupon, the finding so recorded by the learned lower court did
attract interference.
12\. After hearing rival submissions as well as going though the lower court
record coupled with the judgment impugned, the only question now attracts for
consideration is, whether the judgment and decree passed by the learned lower
is sustainable?
It is apparent that just after appearance of the appellant-
defendants, written statement has been filed and, from perusal of the same it
is evident that much stress has been given over non- Patna High Court FA No.12
of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  14/36 compliance of Section 80 of the CPC. For better
appreciation, Section 80 of the CPC is quoted below:
> "80. Notice.--(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2), no suit
> shall be instituted against the Government (including the Government of the
> State of Jammu and Kashmir) or against a public officer in respect of any
> act purporting to be done by such public officer in his official capacity,
> until the expiration of two months next after notice in writing has been
> delivered to, or left at the office of--
> (a) in the case of a suit against the Central Government, except where it
> relates to a Railway, a Secretary to that Government;
> (b) in the case of a suit against the Central Government where it relates to
> a Railway, the General Manager of that Railway;
> *** (bb) in the case of a suit against the Government of the State of Jammu
> and Kashmir, the Chief Secretary to that Government or any other officer
> authorised by that Government in this behalf;
> (c) in the case of a suit against any other State Government, a Secretary to
> that Government or the Collector of the district;
> *** and, in the case of a public officer, delivered to him or left at his
> office, stating the cause of action, the name, description and place of
> residence of the plaintiff and the relief which he claims; and the plaint
> shall contain a statement that such notice has been so delivered or left.
> (2) A suit to obtain an urgent or immediate relief against the Government
> (including the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir) or any public
> officer in respect of any act purporting to be done by such public officer
> in his official capacity, may be instituted, with the leave of the court,
> without serving any notice as required by sub-section (1); but the court
> shall not grant relief in the suit, whether interim or otherwise, except
> after giving to the Government or public officer, as the case may be, a
> reasonable opportunity of showing cause in respect of the relief prayed for
> in the suit:
> Provided that the court shall, if it is satisfied, after hearing the
> parties, that no urgent or immediate relief need be granted in the suit,
> return the plaint for presentation to it after complying with the
> requirements of sub-section (1).
Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  15/36 (3) No suit instituted
against the Government or against a public officer in respect of any act
purporting to be done by such public officer in his official capacity shall be
dismissed merely by reason of any error or defect in the notice referred to in
sub-section (1), if in such notice--
(a) the name, description and the residence of the plaintiff had been so given
as to enable the appropriate authority or the public officer to identify the
person serving the notice and such notice had been delivered or left at the
office of the appropriate authority specified in sub-section (1), and
(b) the cause of action and the relief claimed by the plaintiff had been
substantially indicated."
From perusal of Section 80 of the CPC quoted hereinabove, it is evident that
in ordinary course of nature the party is required to serve a notice two
months preceding the institution of the suit. However, the aforesaid
requirement has been made to stride whenever there happens to be case of
urgency, which the court concerned has to perceive with a cogent reason. In
case, there happens to be some sort of deficiency then in that circumstance
the plaint has to be returned till compliance of Sub-
section (1) of Section 80 of the CPC in terms of proviso of Section 80(2) of
the CPC.
In State of A.P. vs. M/s Pioneer Builders, A.P.
reported in AIR 2007 SC 113 it has been held:
> 13\. From a bare reading of sub-section (1) of Section 80, it is plain that
> subject to what is provided in sub-section (2) thereof, no suit can be filed
> against the Government or a public officer unless requisite notice under the
> said provision has been served on such Government or public officer, as the
> case may be. It is well settled that before the amendment of Section 80 the
> Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  16/36 provisions of
> unamended Section 80 admitted of no implications and exceptions whatsoever
> and are express, explicit and mandatory. The section imposes a statutory and
> unqualified obligation upon the court and in the absence of compliance with
> Section 80, the suit is not maintainable. (See Bhagchand Dagadusa v. Secy.
> of State for India in Council [(1926-27) 54 IA 338 : AIR 1927 PC 176] ;
> Sawai Singhai Nirmal Chand v. Union of India [(1966) 1 SCR 986 : AIR 1966 SC
> 1068] and Bihari Chowdhary v. State of Bihar [(1984) 2 SCC 627] .) The
> service of notice under Section 80 is, thus, a condition precedent for the
> institution of a suit against the Government or a public officer. The
> legislative intent of the section is to give the Government sufficient
> notice of the suit, which is proposed to be filed against it so that it may
> reconsider the decision and decide for itself whether the claim made could
> be accepted or not. As observed in Bihari Chowdhary [(1984) 2 SCC 627] the
> object of the section is the advancement of justice and the securing of
> public good by avoidance of unnecessary litigation.
> 14\. It seems that the provision did not achieve the desired results
> inasmuch as it is a matter of common experience that hardly any matter is
> settled by the Government or the public officer concerned by making use of
> the opportunity afforded by the said provisions. In most of the cases,
> notice given under Section 80 remains unanswered. In its 14th Report
> (reiterated in the 27th and 54th Reports), the Law Commission, while noting
> that the provisions of this section had worked a great hardship in a large
> number of cases where immediate relief by way of injunction against the
> Government or a public officer was necessary in the interests of justice,
> had recommended omission of the section. However, the Joint Committee of
> Parliament, to which the Amendment Bill, 1974 was referred, did not agree
> with the Law Commission and recommended retention of Section 80 with
> necessary modifications/relaxations.
15\. Thus, in conformity therewith, by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment)
Act, 1976 the existing Section 80 was renumbered as Section 80(1) and sub-
sections (2) and (3) were inserted with effect from 1-2-1977. Sub-section (2)
carved out an Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  17/36 exception
to the mandatory rule that no suit can be filed against the Government or a
public officer unless two months' notice has been served on such Government or
public officer. The provision mitigates the rigours of sub-section (1) and
empowers the court to allow a person to institute a suit without serving any
notice under sub-section (1) in case it finds that the suit is for the purpose
of obtaining an urgent and immediate relief against the Government or a public
officer. But, the court cannot grant relief under the sub-section unless a
reasonable opportunity is given to the Government or public officer to show
cause in respect of the relief prayed for. The proviso to the said sub-section
enjoins that in case the court is of the opinion that no urgent and immediate
relief should be granted, it shall return the plaint for presentation to it
after complying with the requirements of sub-section (1). Sub-section (3),
though not relevant for the present case, seeks to bring in the rule of
substantial compliance and tends to relax the rigour of sub-section (1).
16\. Thus, from a conjoint reading of sub-
sections (1) and (2) of Section 80, the legislative intent is clear, namely,
service of notice under sub- section (1) is imperative except where urgent and
immediate relief is to be granted by the court, in which case a suit against
the Government or a public officer may be instituted, but with the leave of
the court. Leave of the court is a condition precedent. Such leave must
precede the institution of a suit without serving notice. Even though Section
80(2) does not specify how the leave is to be sought for or given, yet the
order granting leave must indicate the ground(s) pleaded and application of
mind thereon. A restriction on the exercise of power by the court has been
imposed, namely, the court cannot grant relief, whether interim or otherwise,
except after giving the Government or a public officer a reasonable
opportunity of showing cause in respect of relief prayed for in the suit.
17\. Having regard to the legislative intent noticed above, it needs little
emphasis that the power conferred on the court under sub-section (2) is to
avoid genuine hardship and is, therefore, coupled Patna High Court FA No.12 of
2004 dt.07-08-2020  18/36 with a duty to grant leave to institute a suit
without complying with the requirements of sub-section (1) thereof, bearing in
mind only the urgency of the relief prayed for and not the merits of the case.
More so, when want of notice under sub-section (1) is also made good by
providing that even in urgent matters relief under this provision shall not be
granted without giving a reasonable opportunity to the Government or a public
officer to show cause in respect of the relief prayed for. The provision also
mandates that if the court is of the opinion that no urgent or immediate
relief deserves to be granted it should return the plaint for presentation
after complying with the requirements contemplated in sub-section (1)."
In the background of aforesaid principles laid down by the Apex Court now the
order dated 11.11.1998 has to be gone through wherefrom it is evident that no
reason has been assigned while accepting the prayer of the respondent-
plaintiff on the score of waiving of compliance of Sub-section (1) of Section
80 of the CPC, nor from the record much less pleadings the plea is found
justified.
13\. Before coming to factual aspect a glance over Jawahar Rojgar Yojana
should be given though, in specific words it has not been pleaded but
subsequently parties stalled thereon.
Under the directive principles of the State more particularly under the guise
of Article 41 of the Constitution casts an obligation upon the State to
acknowledge the right to work more particularly relating to the citizens
living under poverty line for their livelihood. Its identification at a
initial stage was under Rural Man Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  19/36 Power (RMP)-1960-61,Crash Scheme For Rural Employment
(CSRE)-1971-72, Pilot Intensive Rural Employment Programme (PIREP)-1972, Small
Farmers Development Agency (SFDA), Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labour
Scheme (MFALS).
Then its colour was changed and in the year 1977 it was reproduced as Food for
Work Programme (FWP). In 1980, it was again streamlined under National Rural
Employment Programme (NREP), and then to Rural Landless Employment Guarantee
Programme (RLEGP) and then in the year 1993 it was Jawahar Rojgar Yojana (JRY)
and then Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS). Then Employment Assurance Scheme
and Jawahar Rojgar Yojana have been merged as Jawahar Grameen Samridhi Yojana
(JGSY)-1999-2000. This programme has been allowed to merge with Sampoorn
Grameen Rojgar Yojana (SGRY)-2001-02 and then National Food for Work Programme
(NFWP). Lastly, it has been given legal identify by way of introducing Mahatma
Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 which is presently commanding
the horizon.
From the circulars relating to Jawahar Rojgar Yojana certain rules are to be
incorporated guiding the sphere:

:0 dh jkf"k gh nh tk ldsxhA From perusal of relevant circulars as referred to
hereinabove, it is abundantly clear that the scheme has to be identified by
the Panchayat (rule 10). There happens to be no evidence on record on that
very score and in likewise manner the selection of an agent is to be by the
Executive Committee [(rule 8.1] as well as Rule 14.2 and so, identification of
respondent-
plaintiff as an agent should have been accordingly exercised.
From Exhibits 2, the order dated 3.10.1994/04.10.1994 (2nd paragraph) it is
evident that there was no selection at the end of the Executive Committee
rather a petition was filed by the respondent-plaintiff before the Block
Development Officer, Turkauliya who nominated him and granted sanction for
executing an agreement. In likewise manner, the estimate of the construction
of bridge has been shown at Rs.10,00,000/-, it is further evident from the
evidence of PW-8 as well as rule 11 that Executive Engineer was competent only
to grant technical sanction relating to estimate extending up to 5 lacs rupees
and in likewise manner the Deputy Development Commissioner, the administrative
sanctioning authority to be competent enough to grant administrative sanction
up to 5 lacs rupees. Exceeding the amount, identify the superior officials.
That means to say, the technical Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  25/36 sanction was to be given by the Superintending Engineer
while the administrative sanction by the Commissioner. There happens to be no
provision under the circular of Jawahar Rojgar Yojana whereunder estimate
could be bifurcated in order to facilitate the junior official to grant
technical sanction as well as administrative sanction. That means to say, the
activities have been taken out in utter violation of circular, which is found
corroborated from Exhibit 4, 4/1.
From the evidence of PW-8, it is apparent that after bifurcating the estimate,
whereby the estimate has been reduced less than 5 lacs, facilitating the
Executive Engineer to gran technical sanction and in likewise manner, the
Deputy Development Commissioner to grant administrative sanction as is evident
from Exhibits 3/1, 1/6, 1/7.
14\. From the evidence having been adduced on behalf of respondent/plaintiff
coupled with pleading, it is crystal clear that neither there happens to be
pleading on the score of nomination as an agent by the Executive Committee of
the Panchayat nor, competency of Deputy Development Commissioner to bifurcate
the estimate. In likewise manner no document/pleading is there to substantiate
the scheme being selected by the Panchayat. That means to say, the nomination
of the respondent-plaintiff has been Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004
dt.07-08-2020  26/36 made in contravention of the circular in clandestine
manner. The scheme was not approved by the Panchayat, even in worse case, the
estimate was for more than 5 lacs, no authority was entrusted for its
bifurcation but the same was done and the Deputy Development Commissioner who
ought not to be administrative sanctioning authority by such illegal
activities resumed the power to grant sanction. The respondent-plaintiff may
say that he was not at all concerned with the affair settled departmentally
but, his nomination, contrary to the rule speaks otherwise and further
activities speak collusiveness amongst all and, during course thereof the
authorities acted dishonestly by preparing the document in order to have
illegal gain.
15\. In Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam vs. Raj Kumar Rajinder Singh reported in
(2019)14 SCC 449, it has been held:
> "65. The question in the instant case is as to whether an incumbent can be
> permitted to play blatant fraud time and again and court has to be silent
> spectator under the guise of label of the various legal proceedings at
> different stages by taking different untenable stands whether compensation
> can be claimed several times as done in the instant case and its effect.
> Before the land acquisition had been commenced in 1987, the land more than
> 1000 bighas had been declared a surplus in ceiling case and compensation
> collected, which indeed (quaere included) disputed land at Jhakari, it would
> be a perpetuating fraud in case such a person is permitted to claim
> compensation for same very land. Fraud vitiates the solemn proceedings; such

> *** **** ****
> 68\. Fraud vitiates every solemn proceeding and no right can be claimed by a
> fraudster on the ground of technicalities. On behalf of the appellants,
> reliance has been placed on the definition of "fraud" as defined in Black's
> Law Dictionary, which is as under:
> "Fraud: (1) A knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a
> material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment. Fraud is
> usually a tort, but in some cases (esp. when the conduct is wilful) it may
> be a crime. ... (2) A misrepresentation made recklessly without belief in
> its truth to induce another person to act. (3) A tort arising from a knowing
> misrepresentation, concealment of material fact, or reckless
> misrepresentation made to induce another to act to his or her detriment. (4)
> Unconscionable dealing; esp., in contract law, the unconscientious use of
> the power arising out of the parties' relative positions and resulting in an
> unconscionable bargain."
> 69\. Halsbury's Laws of England has defined "fraud" as follows:
> "Whenever a person makes a false statement which he does not actually and
> honestly believe to be true, for purpose of civil liability, the statement
> is as fraudulent as if he had stated that which he did know to be true, or
> know or believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and honest belief
> is all that is necessary to satisfy the requirement of the law, whether the
> representation has been made recklessly or deliberately, indifference or
> recklessness on the part of the representor as to the truth or falsity of
> the representation affords merely an instance of absence of such a belief.
> "70. In Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake, "fraud" has been defined thus:
> "It is not easy to give a definition of what constitutes fraud in the
> extensive significance in which that term is understood by Civil Courts of
> Justice. The courts have always avoided hampering themselves by defining or
> laying down as a general proposition what shall be held to Patna High Court
> FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  28/36 constitute fraud. Fraud is infinite in
> variety... Courts have always declined to define it, ... reserving to
> themselves the liberty to deal with it under whatever form it may present
> itself. Fraud ... may be said to include property (sic properly) all acts,
> omissions, and concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable
> duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or
> by which an undue or unconscientious advantage is taken of another. All
> surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and other unfair way that is used to
> cheat anyone is considered as fraud. Fraud in all cases implies a wilful act
> on the part of anyone, whereby another is sought to be deprived, by illegal
> or inequitable means, of what he is entitled to."
> 71\. In Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri
> Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] , it was observed that fraud vitiates every solemn
> act. Fraud and justice never dwell together and it cannot be perpetuated or

> This Court observed as under: (SCC pp. 327-29, paras 15-18, 23 & 25) "15.
> Commission of fraud on court and suppression of material facts are the core
> issues involved in these matters. Fraud, as is well known, vitiates every

Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  29/36
25\. Although in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is
anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot
be perpetuated or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including
res judicata."

72\. In Madhukar Sadbha Shivarkar v. State of Maharashtra [Madhukar Sadbha
Shivarkar v. State of Maharashtra, (2015) 6 SCC 557 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 368 :
(2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 239] , this Court observed that fraud had been played by
showing the records and the orders obtained unlawfully by the declarant, would
be a nullity in the eye of the law though such orders have attained finality.
Following observations were made: (SCC pp. 569-70, para 27) "27. The said
order is passed by the State Government only to enquire into the landholding
records with a view to find out as to whether original land revenue records
have been destroyed and fabricated to substantiate their unjustifiable claim
by playing fraud upon the Tahsildar and appellate authorities to obtain the
orders unlawfully in their favour by showing that there is no surplus land
with the Company and its shareholders as the valid sub-leases are made and
they are accepted by them in the proceedings under Section 21 of the Act, on
the basis of the alleged false declarations filed by the shareholders and sub-
lessees under Section 6 of the Act. The plea urged on behalf of the State
Government and the de facto complainant owners, at whose instance the orders
are passed by the State Government on the alleged ground of fraud played by
the declarants upon the Tahsildar and appellate authorities to get the illegal
orders obtained by them to come out from the clutches of the land ceiling
provisions of the Act by creating the revenue records, which is the fraudulent
act on their part which unravels everything and therefore, the question of
limitation under the provisions to exercise power by the State Government does
not arise at all. For this purpose, the Deputy Commissioner of Pune Division
was appointed as the enquiry officer to hold such an enquiry to enquire into
the matter and submit his report for consideration of the Government to take
further action in the matter. The legal contentions urged by Mr Naphade, in
justification of the impugned judgment and order prima facie at this stage, we
are satisfied that the allegation of fraud in relation to getting the
landholdings of the villages referred to supra by the declarants on the
alleged ground of destroying Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020
30/36 original revenue records and fabricating revenue records to show that
there are 384 sub-leases of the land involved in the proceedings to retain the
surplus land illegally as alleged, to the extent of more than 3000 acres of
land and the orders are obtained unlawfully by the declarants in the land
ceiling limits will be nullity in the eye of the law though such orders have
attained finality; if it is found in the enquiry by the enquiry officer that
they are tainted with fraud, the same can be interfered with by the State
Government and its officers to pass appropriate orders. The landowners are
also aggrieved parties to agitate their rights to get the orders which are
obtained by the declarants as they are vitiated in law on account of nullity
is the tenable submission and the same is well founded and therefore, we
accept the submission to justify the impugned judgment and order Babu Maruti
Dukare v. State of Maharashtra [Babu Maruti Dukare v. State of Maharashtra,
2006 SCC OnLine Bom 1268 : (2007) 2 AIR Bom R 361] of the Division Bench of
the High Court."

73\. In Jai Narain Parasrampuria v. Pushpa Devi Saraf [Jai Narain
Parasrampuria v. Pushpa Devi Saraf, (2006) 7 SCC 756] , this Court observed
that fraud vitiates every solemn act. Any order or decree obtained by
practising fraud is a nullity. This Court held as under:
"55. It is now well settled that fraud vitiates all solemn act. Any order or
decree obtained by practising fraud is a nullity. [See (1) Ram Chandra Singh
v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] followed
in (2) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. Girdharilal Yadav [Kendriya Vidyalaya

Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  31/36 (emphasis supplied)
74\. In State of A.P. v. T. Suryachandra Rao [State of A.P. v. T. Suryachandra
Rao, (2005) 6 SCC 149] , it was observed that where the land which was offered
for surrender had already been acquired by the State and the same had vested
in it. It was held that merely because an enquiry was made, the Tribunal was
not divested of the power to correct the error when the respondent had clearly
committed a fraud. Following observations were made: (SCC pp. 152-53 & 155,
paras 7-10 & 13-16) "7. The order of the High Court is clearly erroneous.
There is no dispute that the land which was offered for surrender by the
respondent had already been acquired by the State and the same had vested in
it. This was clearly a case of fraud. Merely because an enquiry was made, the
Tribunal was not divested of the power to correct the error when the
respondent had clearly committed a fraud.
8\. By "fraud" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any
expectation of advantage to the party himself or from ill-will towards the
other is immaterial. The expression "fraud" involves two elements, deceit and
injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss,
that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable or of money and
it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind,
reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary
loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always cause loss or
detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit
or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the
second condition is satisfied. [See Vimla v. Delhi Admn. [Vimla v. Delhi
Admn., 1963 Supp (2) SCR 585 : AIR 1963 SC 1572 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 434] and
Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres (India) (P) Ltd. [Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres
(India) (P) Ltd., (1996) 5 SCC 550] ]
9\. A "fraud" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing
something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to
gain by another's loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (See
S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath [S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath,
(1994) 1 SCC 1] .)
10\. "Fraud" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice
never dwell together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which
includes the other Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  32/36
person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to
the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is also well settled
that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent
misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief against fraud. A
fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man
into damage by wilfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on
falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he
knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which
the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court
is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive
the rights of the others in relation to a property would render the
transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a
given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is an anathema to all
equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated
or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata.
(See Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi,
(2003) 8 SCC 319] .) ***
13\. This aspect of the matter has been considered recently by this Court in
Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal [Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal, (2002) 1 SCC 100 : 2002
SCC (L&S) 97] , Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate
Education [Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate
Education, (2003) 8 SCC 311] , Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra
Singh v. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of
T.N. [Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N., (2004) 3 SCC 1]
14\. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the
court. (See Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust [Gowrishankar v.
Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust, (1996) 3 SCC 310] and S.P. Chengalvaraya
Naidu v. Jagannath [S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath, (1994) 1 SCC 1] .)
15\. "Fraud" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other
person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to
the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is
not fraud but it can be evidence of fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav
[Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020
33/36 Board of High School and Intermediate Education, (2003) 8 SCC 311] .
16\. In Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley [Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley,
(1956) 1 QB 702 : (1956) 2 WLR 502 : (1956) 1 All ER 341 (CA)] , Lord Denning
observed at QB pp. 712 and 713: (All ER p. 345 C) 'No judgment of a court, no
order of a minister can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud.
Fraud unravels everything.' In the same judgment, Lord Parker, L.J. observed
that fraud 'vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a
degree of solemnity' (All ER p. 351 E- F)."
(emphasis supplied)
75\. In A.V. Papayya Sastry v. State of A.P. [A.V. Papayya Sastry v. State of
A.P., (2007) 4 SCC 221] , this Court as to the effect of fraud on the judgment
or order observed thus: (SCC pp. 231 & 236-37, paras 21-22 & 38-39) "21. Now,
it is well-settled principle of law that if any judgment or order is obtained
by fraud, it cannot be said to be a judgment or order in law. Before three
centuries, Chief Justice Edward Coke proclaimed:
'Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal.'
22\. It is thus settled proposition of law that a judgment, decree or order
obtained by playing fraud on the court, tribunal or authority is a nullity and
non est in the eye of the law. Such a judgment, decree or order--by the first
court or by the final court--has to be treated as nullity by every court,
superior or inferior. It can be challenged in any court, at any time, in
appeal, revision, writ or even in collateral proceedings.
***
38\. The matter can be looked at from a different angle as well. Suppose, a
case is decided by a competent court of law after hearing the parties and an
order is passed in favour of the plaintiff applicant which is upheld by all
the courts including the final court. Let us also think of a case where this
Court does not dismiss special leave petition but after granting leave decides
the appeal finally by recording reasons. Such order can truly be said to be a
judgment to which Article 141 of the Constitution applies. Likewise, the
doctrine of merger also gets attracted. All orders passed by the
courts/authorities Patna High Court FA No.12 of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  34/36
below, therefore, merge in the judgment of this Court and after such judgment,
it is not open to any party to the judgment to approach any court or authority
to review, recall or reconsider the order.
39\. The above principle, however, is subject to exception of fraud. Once it
is established that the order was obtained by a successful party by practising
or playing fraud, it is vitiated. Such order cannot be held legal, valid or in
consonance with law. It is non-existent and non est and cannot be allowed to
stand. This is the fundamental principle of law and needs no further
elaboration. Therefore, it has been said that a judgment, decree or order
obtained by fraud has to be treated as a nullity, whether by the court of
first instance or by the final court. And it has to be treated as non est by
every court, superior or inferior."
Supervisory jurisdiction of the court can be exercised in case of error
apparent on the face of the record, abuse of process and if the issue goes to
the root of the matter.
76\. In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath [S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v.
Jagannath, (1994) 1 SCC 1] , this Court noted that the issue of fraud goes to
the root of the matter and it exercised powers under Article 136 to cure the
defect. The Court observed: (SCC p. 5, paras 5-6) "5. The High Court
[Jagannadh v. Perumal Naidu, 1967 SCC OnLine Mad 103 : (1969) 82 LW 167] , in
our view, fell into patent error. The short question before the High Court was
whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, Jagannath obtained the
preliminary decree by playing fraud on the court. The High Court, however,
went haywire and made observations which are wholly perverse. We do not agree
with the High Court that 'there is no legal duty cast upon the plaintiff to
come to court with a true case and prove it by true evidence'. The principle
of 'finality of litigation' cannot be pressed to the extent of such an
absurdity that it becomes an engine of fraud in the hands of dishonest
litigants. The courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the
parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean hands. We are
constrained to say that more often than not, the process of the court is being
abused. Property-grabbers, tax evaders, bank loan-dodgers and other
unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the court-process a
convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely. We have no
hesitation to say that a person, whose case is Patna High Court FA No.12 of
2004 dt.07-08-2020  35/36 based on falsehood, has no right to approach the
court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation.
6\. The facts of the present case leave no manner of doubt that Jagannath
obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the court. A fraud is an
act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking
unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by another's
loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. Jagannath was working as
a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction
on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the
registered release deed (Ext. B-15) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding the
property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal
amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these facts, he
filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that he had
purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar.
Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the trial is
tantamount to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the
observations of the High Court that the appellant-defendants could have easily
produced the certified registered copy of Ext. B-15 and non-suited the
plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all the
documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite
party."
From the order dated 07.01.1998 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Patna in CWJC No.6612 of 1996 (Exhibit 2/2) it is evident that as the learned
counsel for the petitioner did not want to press the aforesaid writ petition,
whereupon was dismissed. However, it was opined during course thereof
"Dismissal of this writ petition will, however, not preclude the petitioner
from approaching any other forum available under law Patna High Court FA No.12
of 2004 dt.07-08-2020  36/36 for redressal of his grievance". Civil court has
not properly been identified. It happens to be administrative forum and so,
the superior official than that of Collector would have been appellate
authority, more particularly, the Commissioner, though not identified under
the circular of Jawahar Rojgar Yojana but the "Practice and Procedure Manual"
could come in rescue.
16\. Consequent thereupon, the judgment impugned suffers from inherent defects
and is accordingly set aside.
17\. The appeal is allowed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the
case there shall be no order as to cost.
