::: 3 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc the Defendants in the Plaintifffs script of
the play 'The Laboratoryf, the script of a cinematographic flm based on the
script of the play, the revised script/refned version of the script of the
cinematographic flm and the Plaintifffs further work towards a screenplay
running into 90 pages which has been fled in a sealed cover in the Court.
These are hereinafter referred to as "the Plaintifffs work".
2\. The case of the Plaintiff as crystalized in the Written Submissions is
that the Defendantsf flm "Umeed" is a substantial reproduction and/or an
altered copy of the Plaintifffs works and violates the Plaintifffs copyright
in her literary works. It is the Plaintifffs contention that if one were to
read the play script and the flm story and thereafter watch the Plaintifffs
play and the Defendantsf flm, one would walk away with the unmistakable
impression that the Defendantsf flm is nothing but a substantial and material
copy of the Plaintifffs works.
3\. The Plaintiff has fled the present Notice of Motion in the Suit seeking
restraint on the release of the flm produced by the Defendants.

4.5. The script made into a play was extremely well received by the general
public and experts in the industry and has been complimented in reviews in
prominent newspapers. The newspaper articles also elucidate what were
considered to be the essential and material features of the Plaintifffs play
script by the critics and the public at large.
4.6. Given the success of the play, the Plaintiff published it in the form of
a book titled 'the Laboratory and Other Playsf ('the Bookf) alongwith two
other plays which was released in February 2013. A second launch event for the
said Book which was attended by well-known personalities was held at a widely
publicized event at a popular bookstore, viz. Kitab Khana at Flora Fountain,
Mumbai. 4.7. The Plaintiff wrote a script in 2012-13 for the purpose of a
cinematographic flm. This is also claimed to be an original and novel work and
built upon the uniuue expression of the idea of unethical medical trials as
captured in the play. The script of the cinematographic flm was circulated to
various people in the flm /theatre industry.
4.8. According to the Plaintiff, the script of the Plaintifffs cinematographic
flm is fundamentally the same as the script of the play, but there are some
slight variations. The Plaintiff decided that in the cinematographic flm the
protagonist would not commit suicide and that, with her boyfriendfs help, she
would see the court proceedings through successfully and get the CEO of the
pharmaceutical company nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on -

> "(i) In addition to the characters in the play, this story has additional
> characters of children who die on account of an unethical drug trial and
> their parents who have sufered on account of the same.

industry. 4.10. The Plaintiff registered a refned version of the story (to
which also the Plaintiff claims copyright) with the Film Writers Association
on 29th March 2016 and also shared her work with the flm and television
industry. 4.11. The Plaintiff claims that she further worked towards a
screenplay running into 90 pages in or about June 2016. The Plaintiff has fled
the said screenplay in a sealed cover. However, the Plaintiff has declined to
make the said screenplay available to the Defendants on the ground that the
same is confdential. Even in the course of arguments, no reliance was placed
on the said screenplay. 4.12. The Plaintiff chanced upon the trailer of the
Defendantsf flm "Umeed" on nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded
on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 10 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc 28th August 2017
and noticed that the Defendantsf flm had startling similarities with both the
script of the Plaintifffs play as well as her script for the cinematographic
flm. The Plaintiff immediately wrote to the Film Writers Association raising
her grievance in this regard. The Plaintiff also got in touch with Defendant
No.1 on the same day i.e. 28th August 2017. Defendant No.1 agreed to arrange a
screening for the Plaintiff at the earliest. However, despite the Plaintiff
following up with Defendant No.1, the Defendant No.1 failed to screen the
Defendantsf flm for the Plaintiff. 4.13. The Plaintiff therefore fled the
present Suit on 16 th September 2017. The Plaintiff highlighted the
similarities between her works and the trailer of the Defendantsf flm in the
Plaint. The Plaintiff also fled the above application seeking ad-interim /
interim reliefs.
5\. On 18th September 2017, the Plaintiff was directed to remove all ofce
objections and to give notice to the Defendants. However, the Defendants were
not present at the hearing on 21st September, 2017 despite notice. This Court
heard the Plaintiff and directed the Defendants to screen the Defendantsf flm
for the Plaintiff. Defendant No.1 screened the Defendantsf flm for the
Plaintiff on 23 rd September 2017\.
6\. On 6th October 2017, the Plaintiff tendered in Court a Chart of purported
similarities between the Plaintifffs works and the impugned Film.
7\. On 13th October 2017, the Defendants appeared before this Court and nitin

45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc sought time to fle a reply. The Defendants were
permitted to fle reply but, on considering the Plaintifffs case for ad-interim
reliefs, this Court granted an ad-interim order in favour of the Plaintiff
restraining the Defendants, inter alia, from making, broadcasting,
distributing and telecasting the Impugned Film.
8\. The Defendants fled their reply dated 17 th November 2017 to the present
Notice of Motion and opposed the grant of ad-interim/interim reliefs in favour
of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff thereafter fled her Afdavit in Rejoinder dated
30th November 2017\. The matter was thereafter fnally heard, from time to
time.
9\. The learned Advocate appearing for the Plaintiff submitted : 9.1 That the
Plaintiff is the author and owner of copyright in the Plaintifffs work which
constitute original literary work. The script of the play and the
cinematographic flm is essentially one single work and that the Plaintiff has
merely adapted the script of the play to suit a cinematographic flm and has
made such changes necessary for the success of a cinematographic flm. However,
the fundamentals of the play and the flm are nearly identical.
9.2 That there are striking and admitted similarities between the rival works
as set out in a Chart annexed to the Afdavit fled by the Plaintiff. This
cannot be by mere chance. Both the Plaintifffs as well as the Defendantsf
works deal with a female protagonist who is made a pawn by a large
pharmaceutical corporation to conduct unethical drug trials. The female
protagonist, on realizing this, launches a legal battle nitin  ::: Uploaded on

NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc against the pharmaceutical corporation and initiates a
mass countrywide protest in support of the issue. After several adverse
hearings, she eventually wins the case, despite the pharmaceautical
corporationfs violent attempts to stop her and an initially unsympathetic
judge, only because of the change of heart of someone she considered her
mentor. This is the substance, foundation and kernel of the Plaintifffs works
and the Defendantsf flm is substantially similar in this respect to the
Plaintifffs works. 9.3 That the dissimilarities introduced by the Defendants
in the Defendantsf flm are of no relevance since, if the aforesaid kernel is
removed, those dissimilar elements cannot stand.
9.4 That the Defendants have in fact admitted that the plot lines of the
Plaintifffs and the Defendantsf work are similar. However, the Defendants have
sought to caveat the same by stating that these similarities are 'incidentalf,
'inevitablef, 'indirectf, 'co-incidentalf, 'vaguef and 'genericf which are
just an attempt to obfuscate the issue.
9.5 That the Defendants have not provided any proof of them having
independently worked on their flm to prove that the same was an original work.
The Plaintiff has submitted that there is no material produced on record to
show that the co-authors had allegedly worked on the Defendantsf script. 9.6
That the Defendants have not produced any alleged common source which the
Defendants have referred to while writing the script and on account of which
they nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020
02:58:52 ::: 13 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc claim that the rival users
contain same similarities. The material produced by the Defendants which is
annexed to the Afdavit in Reply are certain internet sources downloaded in
2017 and the Defendants have no where averred that these were the materials
they relied on.
9.7 That the Defendantsf case that they had not come across the Plaintifffs
works is inconceivable as the Plaintifffs play has been in public domain since
2007. Since the Plaintiff has circulated the script of the cinematographic flm
in movie circles, there is a very high chance that the Defendants have come
across it. Further, it is submitted that the Defendants have cut various
scenes from their flm, which was shown to the Plaintiff during the screening
and which had been pointed out by the Plaintiff to be similar to the
Plaintifffs works. According to the Plaintiff, this conduct of the Defendants
is malafde and was a misguided attempt to reduce the extent of the similarity.
9.8 That the characters in the Defendantsf flm are not based on real life
personalities as alleged by the Defendants. The character of "Mia", the
protagonist in the Defendantsf flm, cannot be said to be based on Reita Faria
Powell. Ms. Powell was at no point of time concerned with unethical drug
trials and though she was a beauty contest winner, she went on to become a
doctor. The character "Mia" just happens to be a beauty contest winner, who
happens to be associated with unethical drug trials but who does not become a
doctor. The character of "Eliza Moore", a nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020

British Journalist in the Defendantsf flm, has been falsely stated to be based
on Zeina Awad. The ethnicity of the character in the Defendantsf flm is
completely different from that of Zeina Awad and the character of Eliza Moore
has not been shown to be like Zeina Awad, who was a very accomplished
journalist. The character of "Dr.Bali" is falsely stated to be based on Dr.
Satinath Sarangi. It is submitted that the Defendants have failed to establish
any inspiration for the characters that are part of the Defendantsf flm.
9.9 That it is sufcient if the Plaintiff proves that the Defendantsf flm is a
substantial and material copy of the Plaintiffsf work and in order to fnd out
the similarity in the works, what is to be seen is the substance, the
foundation and the kernel of the work and to see if the rival work can stand
if what is copied is deleted from it. In this connection, the observations
made in the case of R.G. Anand vs. M/s. Delux Films & Ors.1 (extracted
subseuuently), Zee Teleflms Ltd. & Anr. vs. Sundial Communications Pvt. Ltd. &
Ors. 2 (paragraph 28), Urmi Juvekar Chiang v. Global Broadcast News Limited3
and Twentieth Century for Film Corporation vs. Sohail Maklai Entertainment
Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.4 (para 22) were relied upon. The Defendantsf case, that the
Plaintiff is seeking protection over ideas, is unfounded. The Plaintiff has
relied upon the judgments of the House of Lords in the case of 1 (1978) 4 SCC
18 2 2003 (27) PTC 457 3 2008 (36) PTC 377 (Bom.) 4 MANU/MH/1244/2010 nitin

parties is unethical drug trials, the treatment of this idea by the Plaintiff
is uniuue.
9.10. That the appearance of so many similarities, many of which have been
admitted, cannot be coincidental and must be presumed to be due to copying.
The Plaintiff has relied upon the judgment in the case of Faber Castell
Aktiengesellschaft and Ors. vs. Cello Pens Pvt. Ltd.8 (paragraph 15). The
Defendants have made trivial variations in their flm to make the infringing
work an altered copy and the same are irrelevant. Reliance was placed on the
judgments in the case of Designer Guild Limited v. Russell Williams (Textiles)
Limited (supra), C. Cunniah and Co. v.
Balraj and Co. 9 (paragraph 9) and R.G. Anand v. M/s Delux Films and Ors.
(Pathak J., concurring) (supra) in this regard.
9.11. That in order to prove infringement of copyright, the Plaintiff need not
prove that the entire work of the Plaintiff is copied but it is sufcient if it
is proved that there is substantial copying. In this regard, apart from the
judgments referred to 5 2000 WL 1720247 6 294 F.3d 1069 (2002) 7 (2016) 5 Bom

NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc above, the Plaintiff has also relied on the judgments
in the case of Ram Sampath v. Rajesh Roshan & Ors.10 and Twentieth Century for
Film Corporation vs. Sohail Maklai Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. (supra)
and in particular paragraph 16 thereof.
9.12. That in the Afdavit in Reply the Defendants have admitted to the
occurrence of several similarities between the works of the Plaintiff and the
Defendants but have not been in a position to explain the reason for the
occurrence of such similarities. The Plaintiff has relied upon the judgment in
the case of Herman Pictures N.V. v. Osborne11, and submitted that in the said
case the Court held that the similarities of incidents and situations afforded
prima facie evidence of copying and that it is for the Defendants to explain
the presence of similarities. 9.13. That in the case of V. Govindan vs. E.M.
Gopalakrishna Kone12 it is interalia held that it is for the Defendant to show
the common sources which he alleges to be available in the market and that the
Defendant in fact utilized the information in these sources. That in the
present case, the Defendants have not even contended that they have used the
alleged sources which are available in the public domain. The printouts show
that the same were taken out in November 2017 and thus could not be the
material on the basis of which the Defendants allegedly authored their work.
The material produced also does not in great detail deal with the idea of 10

9.14. That in light of the facts of the case and submissions made in the
Plaint, the Plaintiff is entitled to the protection of its copyright in the
script of the play and the cinematographic flm and entitled to reliefs prayed
for in the present Notice of Motion.
10\. In response, the learned Advocate appearing for the Defendants submitted
:
10.1 That before adverting to the facts of the present case, it may be
appropriate to consider the law and test to be applied to a case of copyright
infringement. The Defendants relied upon the judgments in the case of Amit
Kalyanaram v. M/s Gurfateh Films & Ors.13 and Mansoob Haider v. Yashraj
Films14 apart from the judgment in the case of R. G. Anand (supra). 10.2 That
the Plaintiff claims that the Defendantsf flm "Umeed" infringes the copyright
of the Plaintiff in a script for a play and in the script of a cinematographic
flm, which was developed from the script of the play. It is the Plaintifffs
case that thereafter the script of the cinematographic flm was further evolved
which is at Exhibit N, page 277 of the Plaint. The Plaintiff also claims that
the script of the cinematographic flm was further developed in June 2016 into
a screenplay of about 90 pages, which is not furnished to the Defendants by
the Plaintiff 13 (2015) 1 Bom CR 460 14 2014 (2015) 1 BOM CR 460 nitin  :::
Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 18 / 45
NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc on the ground that the same is confdential. The
Plaintiff claims copyright in all these four works and alleges that the
Defendantsf flm infringes the copyright of the Plaintiff in these four works.
10.3 That paragraphs 10 and 20 of the Plaint shows the Plaintifffs own
understanding of the essence of the script of the play as opposed to the
essence of the script of the cinematographic flm. The statements of the
Plaintiff in the Plaint demonstrates that the Plaintiff has strained to show
similarity between the script of the Plaintifffs own play and the
cinematographic flm.
10.4 That what is important is what the Plaintiff understood as the essence of
her story, much prior to the fling of the suit. In support, an attention of
the Court is drawn to the substance of the story as narrated by the Plaintiff
when the Plaintiff applied to a Screenwritersf Lab with her story on 5th March
2014 ( Exhibit L, page 257 of the Plaint) ; the brief synopsis of the play and
the flm which the Plaintiff claims to have shared with various people from the
flm industry (page 266 of the Plaint) ; and also the emails dated 20th June
2014 (page 271 of the Plaint) and 2nd April, 2018. 10.5 That from the material
produced by the Plaintiff herself, it is apparent that the essence of the
Plaintifffs script is a story of a little girl having a drunkard father and a
very troubled background, who grows up to become a doctor and avenges the
death of her mother, who was used as a guinea pig in a clinical trial. The
protagonist is a girl named "Joy" whose father is a drunkard and the family
has no nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020

mother goes to Joyfs uncle (her fatherfs brother) - Ralph who is the CEO of a
leading pharmaceutical company for help. Ralph introduces Joyfs mother to Dr.
Pereira who subjects her to clinical trials for money. In the meanwhile, Joyfs
father tries to steal the money which her mother earns and is thrown out of
the house by his wife to be taken in later against threats. With the money
that the mother earns, she pays for the medical education of Joy. Dr. Pereira
becomes Joyfs mentor and she also falls in love with a journalist Arjun. Joyfs
mother fnally dies because of clinical trial and Joy subseuuently comes to
know how her mother was subjected to an illegal clinical trial by her uncle
and her mentor. Joy fles a case against her uncle and his company. In the play
she dies pending the court case. This is where the play ends. In the script of
the cinematographic flm, it is further shown that the decision of the Court
goes against Joy and she battles right till the Supreme Court, where she
succeeds. In the midst, there is a lot of drama. In the initial script for the
flm, both Ralph and Dr. Pereira are put behind the bars and the plant of the
pharmaceutical corporation is shut down. The same is said to have been
developed later to a situation where Dr. Pereira takes a bullet to save an
attack on Joy. There are car chases with attempted hit and run etc. Thus, the
entire story is a story of revenge by a daughter for her motherfs death, who
underwent illegal clinical trial to earn money for her daughterfs education.
It is a story of a girl who and whose family have been cheated and let down by
her uncle and her mentor and how she battles against nitin  ::: Uploaded on -

NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc them to have them fnally delivered to justice. The
case has very complex nuances of relationships including a drunkard father and
a devious uncle. This is in effect the essence of the story.
10.6 That as against the above, the Defendantsf story is essentially that of a
protagonist who with her sister had a happy go lucky life without any family
complications. They lived in a small town and the protagonist Mia always
aspires to go to a big city. When her sister, Trisha gets a job in an NGO in
Mumbai, Trisha insists that their father permit Mia to come to Mumbai with
her. In Mumbai, Miafs dreams unfold and she ends up winning the Miss India
contest. There is a parallel story running about the same time with intercuts
about one Eliza Moore (character based on a real life journalist Zeina Awad)
who is an out spoken humanitarian journalist shown to be in London and who
wants to go to New York to complete her report about a white collar mafa. When
Eliza is close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful
US based pharmaceutical company, she and her key informants including one Dr.
Bali (based on real life character, Dr. Satinath Sarangi) are murdered. One of
Elizafs well-wishers contacts a friend in FBI to investigate the matter, who
fnds out that the pharmaceutical company has been testing its drugs on poor
Indians. Dhruv, the right hand of Dr. Bali meets the FBIfs forensic expert. He
comes to know that the pharmaceutical company is sponsoring the Miss World
India competition which is won by Mia. When Mia attends a camp as a part of
her duties as nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on -

Dhruv scoffs at her for being a party to a criminal act of the pharmaceutical
company. This is when Mia, her sister and Dhruv get-together and battle
against the powerful and rich opponent. The pharmaceutical company fles a case
against Mia for breach of contract which is later withdrawn by it. 10.7. That
in the Defendantsf story there is no case of any troubled background of any
child or the protagonist in any manner being personally affected by the
clinical trials or any of her family members being subjected to the clinical
trial, nor is there any story of revenge as in the Plaintifffs case. There is
no court case fled by the protagonist against the pharmaceutical company or
its CEO for having them arrested. There is only a case of breach of contract
fled against the protagonist which she defends successfully. That there is no
similarity whatsoever between the Plaintifffs work and the Defendantsf flm.
The entire storyline, its characters and its essence are completely distinct
and different. There is no copying leave alone a substantial copy. There is no
appropriation whatsoever of any part of the Plaintifffs works leave alone any
appropriation of any substantial or material part of the protected work. The
chain of events, the storyline and the characters are materially and
demonstrably different.
10.8. That the Defendantsf script has been independently written and developed
by Defendant No.1 and Sanyukta Roy after refering to extensive material on the
subject of clinical trials, which is available in the public domain including

well as news articles and the June 2010 issue of Asian Bioethics Review.
10.9. That there can be no monopoly of copyright in the idea or subject of a
flm based on the theme /subject of clinical trial which is a part of public
domain. 10.10. The characters in the Defendantsf flm are inspired from real
persons, details of which along with photographs form a part of the Afdavit in
Reply as under :
             Character                     Person                      Exhibit /Page

    10.11             That the character of Dr. Bali has been even made to look like Dr.
    Satinath Sarangi in real life.
10.12. That the characters of the two flms are completely different which
would be apparent from the following :
(a) The protagonist Joy, in the Plaintifffs script of the flm is a doctor and
the protagonist Mia, in the Defendantsf flm is a model.
(b) Joy has a lover, Arjun with whom Joy has a romantic relationship in the
Plaintifffs script of the flm. There is no such romantic relationship between
Mia and Dhruv. While Arjun is a journalist who gathers specifc facts against
the CEO, Ralph and his company for the case, Dhruv is a lawyer who argues in
the Court using data available in the public domain.

    (c)               There is a mentor in the Plaintifffs script of the flm, Dr. Pereira who
betrays Joy which results in Joy committing suicide in the play. Whereas, in
the Plaintifffs script of the flm, he subseuuently takes a bullet for her and
saves her life. His betrayal is a very important facet of the Plaintifffs
script of the flm. In the Defendantsf flm, Mia does not have any mentor. There
is no such betrayal. Dr. Bali is based on a real-life character. The Plaintiff
has wrongly stated that Mr. Irani and at some place Mr. Rahul Sharma is the
mentor of Mia. Mr. Irani is a legal Counsel representing a pharmaceutical
company, Times of Hindustan newspaper, etc. on a case to case basis. Mr. Rahul
Sharma owns a newspaper called Times of Hindustan who signs Mia for a brand
endorsement deal involving his newspaper, an ad agency and a pharma company.
He has no direct interest in any clinical trials or their outcomes. Both these
characters are not mentors of Mia.
(d) Joyfs mother was an illiterate housewife who had to offer herself for
clinical trials to earn money. She is betrayed by her brother in law Ralph/his
company. She is a very important character and the story revolves around Joyfs
revenge for her motherfs death, which is the kernel of the Plaintifffs flm and
play. Miafs mother was a social and highly educated lady from a well to do
family. Her character is shown in the flm only for 30 seconds. She was a
social worker who dies due to depression. Her death has nothing to do with the
future course of events.
(e) The character of the father of Joy and Mia are completely different.

Miafs father is an alcoholic who troubles his children. He is a prominent
character whereas Miafs father has no effective role and is shown as a loving
and caring father.
(f) In the Defendantsf flm there is no character of the devious uncle of Mia
who uses his own sister in law for a clinical trial.
(g) In the Defendantsf flm there is a very important character of a
journalist, Ms. Eliza Moore who is based on a real life journalist Zeina Awad.
She has more than 10 scenes in the flm and her investigation is an important
facet of the flm. In the Plaintifffs script of the flm, the character is of a
news reporter who is unimportant and almost used as a prop. There is also the
character of Dr. Bali, which is based on the real life character of Dr.
Satinath Sarangi.
(h) There is a glamour element involved in the Defendantsf flm which involves
models etc. which according to the Plaintiff also is absent in the Plaintifffs
script of the flm.
10.13. That the Plaintiff approached this Court in haste only after viewing
the trailer of the Defendantsf flm. There was no warrant for the Plaintiff to
have approached this Court based on a trailer when the Defendant had offered
the Plaintiff a viewing of the flm to allay the fears of the Plaintiff
immediately when the Plaintiff approached the Defendants on 28th August 2017
with a reuuest for screening. That the chart served on 11th October 2017,
after viewing the flm, reflects an exercise which is impermissible in the
consideration of a matter of infringement of copyright. The nitin  :::

NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc Plaintiff has sought to compare and draw similarities
in dissected portions. The similarities drawn by the Plaintiff are non-
existent and in any case do not constitute an infringement of copyright as the
same relate to scenes commonly occurring in flms especially of the nature
authored by the Defendants. The learned Advocate for the Defendants has relied
upon some of the comparisons drawn by the Plaintiff to argue that the same are
completely absurd and cannot be the basis of a case for copyright
infringement. For example, in item 7 at page 31, the Plaintiff has relied on
an alleged similarity by pointing out that when the mother of the protagonist
dies, she cries sitting on the floor and that in the Defendantsf flm also when
a child dies, her mother too is shown sitting on the floor and crying. That
such instances can never be the basis of the copyright infringement case.
10.14. That there is neither any allegation nor proof for the fact that the
Defendants had access to the Plaintifffs works. The Plaintifffs case that the
play was extensively performed would not in any manner prove access as it is
an admitted position that the script for cinematographic flm has been evolved
after the play and that the entire seuuence relating to the court trial and
the developments thereafter were absent in the play. To all these further
developments in the script of the flm, the Defendants could not have any
access and nor is there an allegation to this effect. 10.15. That on 4th
January 2018, the Plaintiff made an incorrect statement in court that the
Defendantsf flm had already been released and in support of the same, nitin

Defendantsf flm given by 14 individuals purportedly on mouthshut.com. Though
the Plaintiff was directed to fle an afdavit setting out these facts forthwith
and the Defendants were given two days time to fle a reply, the Plaintiff fled
an afdavit only on 11 th January 2018. It is submitted that the purported
reviews are false and if the reviews are taken to be true, then the flm can be
said to be released in more than 10 cities across 7 States. The viewers in the
reviews falsely claimed to have watched the flm in PVR and Inox Cinemas. By
email dated 6th January 2018, the Programming Head of PVR has confrmed that
the flm has not been released in any PVR screens throughout the country. It is
submitted that the reviews are false and fabricated. The Plaintiff took no
steps to verify whether the flm was released. The Plaintiff has addressed
emails and letters to persons not in-charge of responding to uueries of the
nature raised by the Plaintiff. For example, the email addressed to PVR has
been addressed to the Company Secretaryfs ofce of PVR Group. The letter
addressed to the Central Board of Film Certifcation is addressed to its
Chairman when the website clearly mentions the name of their Chief Information
Ofcer Mr. Sanjay Jaiswalfs contact details. The Plaintiff has not made any
enuuiries with Inox cinemas. The Plaintiff had made a positive statement
before this Court on 4th January 2018 that the Defendantsf flm has been
released, whereas in the afdavit, the Plaintiff has made guarded statements
like "...the reviews seem to sugest that the movie was released ...", "...if
the movie has indeed nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on -

10.16. That the contention of the Plaintiff that the Defendants have in any
manner admitted in the Afdavit in Reply that there are similarities between
the works is completely erroneous and a misreading of the Defendantsf Afdavit.
The Defendants have categorically stated that Defendant No.1 along with one
Sunyukta Roy has written the story which is their original work. The
Defendants have in the reply shown a series of differences between the works
of the Plaintiff and the Defendants and that there is no admission of any
similarity as suggested by the Plaintiff.
11\. I have considered the submissions made by the parties and perused the
documents relied upon by the parties. I have seen the flm of the Defendants,
which was furnished to the Court. I have also seen the video recording of the
play which was provided by the Plaintiff. I have also gone through the scripts
submitted by both the parties.
12\. As far as the aspect of the matter concerning delayed screening of the
flm and release of the flm in breach of orders is concerned, the emails
exchanged between the parties especially the email dated 28 th August 2017
addressed by the Defendants does show that the Defendants were willing to
provide screening of the flm. Since the Plaintiff fled a complaint with the
Screenwriters Association on 1 st September 2017, a date was fxed by
Screenwriters Association for the screening on nitin  ::: Uploaded on -

NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc 19th September 2017 and the Plaintiff approached this
Court on 18 th September 2017 before the said screening. Considering the facts
and non-appearance of the Defendants, an Order dated 21st September 2017 for
screening was passed. As far as the allegation of release of the flm, the
Plaintiff has relied upon reviews of certain persons from mouthshut.com. These
reviews do not appear to be genuine as they relate to the release of the flm
in more than 10 cities across 7 States. Even the Censor Certifcate has been
issued subseuuent to the Afdavit and the ad interim order and as such the
uuestion of it having been released in theatres earlier does not arise. In
these circumstances, it cannot be held that the Defendantsf flm was released.
13\. I shall now deal with the submissions made by the parties on the merits
of the matter.
14\. The Plaintiff had written the script of the Plaintifffs play "the
laboratory" in 2007 and registered the same with the Screenwriters Association
under Registration No. 140915 dated 25th June 2008.
15\. The theme of the Plaintifffs play pertains to unethical drug trials and
how the poor and needy fall prey to agreeing to the same for little money.
Pharmaceutical companies are shown to be villainous and exploitative of the
underprivileged. The Plaintifffs play revolves around one such case of
exploitation where the mother of the protagonist agrees to drug trials being
conducted on her without being informed of the harmful and fatal side effects
of intake of such drugs.

The mother of the protagonist volunteers for these drug trials to earn money
to pay for the protagonistfs medical college fees. The protagonist is not
informed by her mother that she would be undergoing drug trials. The mother
develops complications and dies due to the drug trials. The protagonist, who
is an idealistic doctor, is unaware of the reason of her motherfs death and
subseuuently discovers that it is her uncle, who is the CEO of the
multinational pharmaceutical company. On becoming aware of the reason, the
protagonist, together with her boyfriend who is a journalist, decides to
investigate into the dark side of unethical drug trials and build a case
against the multinational pharmaceutical company. The protagonist initiates a
court case against the company. The protagonistfs uncle in the meanwhile
inducts her mentor who is a senior and eminent pharmacologist into the said
company, making him a stakeholder. This is not known to the protagonist. The
protagonist volunteers to help at a tsunami relief camp by disseminating drugs
free of costs. The protagonist learns through her boyfriend that the drugs
distributed were banned abroad or under testing and the distribution was a
ploy to carry out unethical drug testing without the knowledge or consent of
the innocent victims who were consuming the drugs. The protagonist realizes
that she was used as a pawn in this ploy. The protagonist also becomes aware
that her own mentor is responsible for sanctioning unethical drug trials and
confronts him. The protagonist is completely disillusioned and commits
suicide. The trial instituted by the protagonist comes up for hearing after
her death.

16\. The Plaintifffs script for the play ended here. The script of the
cinematographic flm does not end with the death of the protagonist prior to
the commencement of the trial. The script of the cinematographic flm contains
a detailed courtroom drama, with several hearings of the case where the
protagonistfs mentor and the CEO of the pharmaceutical company are present in
Court. The protagonist is shown to take active steps to spread awareness of
the drug trials and visit villages. The protagonist holds candlelight vigils,
organizes and leads angry marches and garners support from people.
Additionally, there are characters of children who die on account of unethical
drug trials and their parents who are shown to suffer on account of the same.
There are documentary style narratives and news reports of poor people and the
exploitative system. The media also takes interest and records and reports
these events. Ultimately, the protagonist and her boyfriend are successful in
winning the case against the CEO of the multinational pharmaceutical company
in the Supreme Court and he is sentenced to life imprisonment.
17\. The events described in the previous paragraph are stated by the
Plaintiff in paragraph 20 of the Plaint to be the essence of the script of the
cinematographic flm. However, what is pertinent is the Plaintifffs own
understanding of the essence of the Plaintifffs works before she fled the
Suit. This is apparent from her application to the Screenwriters Lab on 5 th
March, 2014 and emails dated 4 th January, 2014, 20th January, 2014 and 2nd
April, 2014 which she addressed to third nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020

parties. When these are perused, it is apparent that the Plaintifffs own
understanding of the essence of her works was much different from what she
seeks to portray in the Plaint.
18\. The Plaintifffs script for the play is a personal story, which revolves
around a girl, who suffers, who aspires to be a doctor, does become one and
eventually commits suicide because of the death of her mother on account of
unethical drug trials. The mother of the protagonist undergoes an illegal drug
trial to raise funds for the education of her daughter. Interspersed with this
is the drunkard father of the Plaintiff who adds to her problems. There is
emphasis on the unhappy domestic life of the protagonist. The protagonist
feels betrayed when she fnds that her uncle and her mentor were directly
involved in conducting drug trials on the protagonistfs mother and though she
fles a case against her uncle and the doctor, she is overwhelmed with emotions
and commits suicide. The play is targeted to this emotional journey of the
protagonist.
19\. The Plaintifffs flm on the other hand focuses on her fght to defeat the
drug companies and how she and her boyfriend are successful in winning the
Court case because of their relentless efforts. There are various twists added
where her father also joins the fght in some way or her mentor sacrifces his
life to save hers. The Plaintifffs script of the cenematgrophic flm shows that
initially the protagonist loses the Court battle against her uncle and his

Supreme Court and her uncle is brought to justice. In every narration of the
Plaintiff, there is a great emphasis on the sacrifce of her mother and the
deceit by her uncle and mentor.
20\. In the Defendantsf script of the flm there are characters of two sisters,
Mia and her adopted sister Trisha who hail from a small town. Mia loses her
mother at a very young age. Trisha writes several articles and blogs on
"consented treatment" and eventually gets an opportunity to work with an NGO
in Mumbai headed by Dr. Bali. Trisha feels that Mia would be left alone and
insists that their father permit Mia to come to Mumbai with Trisha. Trisha
meets a lawyer, Dhruv in Mumbai who is associated with Dr. Bali and who
informs Trisha that they would be leaving the city after submitting some
important paper work in the Bombay High Court. In the meanwhile, Mia is shown
to become a beauty contest winner and has a number of camps to visit and
social appearances to make for causes of which she has no clue. There is also
a character of a journalist, Eliza who raised issues about malpractices of
pharmaceutical companies. When Eliza gets too close to uncovering the truth,
Eliza, Dr. Bali and Dr. Nisha are murdered. Elizafs well-wisher, Trehan, who
is an FBI forensic psychology expert decides to uncover the cause of Elizafs
death and comes across information with respect to fraudulent testing of a
drug on poor Indian subjects without them being informed about the full nature
of the harmful side effects. Trehan supplies this information to Dhruv and
informs him that the pharmaceutical company nitin  ::: Uploaded on -

during the unveiling of Miss World India, when Mia would be crowned as such.
Dhruv and Trisha inform Mia of the intent of the pharmaceutical company and
how she was being used in their entire agenda. Mia together with Trisha and
Dhruv decides to battle against the company. Mia decides to terminate her
endorsement contract with respect to the harmful drug and a case is fled by
the ad agency handling the marketing of the company against Mia for breach of
contract and defamation for rescinding the endorsement contract. This case is
withdrawn by the company in the court of frst instance.
21\. Before considering the aspect of infringement, it would be appropriate to
advert to judgments cited by both the learned Advocates appearing for the
parties on the tests to be applied while comparing the rival works in an
action for infringement of copyright. On a perusal of the judgments, it is
clear that in an action for copyright infringement, the Plaintiff is reuuired
to prove substantial copying of its work. The Plaintiff need not prove that
the entire work is copied. If it is proved that the substance or kernel of the
Plaintifffs work is copied, the same would amount to infringement of
copyright. What is to be considered is, if this substance or kernel which is
copied in the Defendantsf work is deleted, whether the Defendantsf work can
stand. The rival works are to be compared as a whole and not dissected into
small fractions bearing no originality on their own. In a situation like the
present one, where the rival works are based upon a common theme/ subject,
what is to be remembered is nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded
on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 34 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc that there are
bound to be similarities to some extent when works dealing with the same
subject/theme are compared. However, what is to be considered is the treatment
of the subject/theme, the manner in which the idea is expressed and not the
idea itself. The protectable story elements in the rival works must be
considered, which do not necessarily flow from the subject/theme and which as
such are uniuue. It is the uuality of the work copied and not the uuantity
that would determine infringement of the work or a substantial part thereof.
The dissimilarities introduced in the infringing work should not be
deliberate, introduced by an intelligent copier only to create a farce of an
independent work, which are trivial in nature and are inconseuuential to the
determination of copying and/or substantial copying.
22\. Following test laid down in the case of R.G. Anand vs. Delux Film (supra)
is relevant :
> R.G. Anand v. Delux Films , (1978) 4 SCC 118 at page 140 of the copyright
> infringement in flm related matters. "46. Thus, on a careful consideration
> and elucidation of the various authorities and the case law on the subject
> discussed above, the following propositions emerge :
> 1\. There can be no copyright in an idea, subject-matter, themes, plots or
> historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases
> is confned to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by
> the author of the copyrighted work.
2\. Where the same idea is being developed in a diferent manner, it is
manifest that the source being common, similarities are bound to nitin  :::
Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 35 / 45
NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc occur. In such a case the courts should determine
whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of
the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the defendant's
work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some
variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright. In
other words, in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and
material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is
guilty of an act of piracy.
3\. One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there
has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader, spectator or the
viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and
gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy
of the original.
4\. Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so
that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work, no question of
violation of copyright arises.
5\. Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there
are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to
copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly
incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.
6\. As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved
by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the
case-law discussed above.
7\. Where however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage
play by a flm producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more
difcult to prove piracy. It is manifest nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020
::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 36 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc
that unlike a stage play a flm has a much broader prospective, wider feld and
a biger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of
incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the
copyrighted work has expressed the idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing
the flm gets a totality of impression that the flm is by and large a copy of
the original play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved.
(emphasis supplied)"
23\. Keeping the aforesaid principles in mind and on considering the works of
the Plaintiff and the Defendants, in my view, a fnding that the Defendantsf
work is a substantial copy of the Plaintifffs script of the cinematographic
flm as originally written and developed from time to time cannot be arrived
at. Though both stories are based on the common theme of unethical drug
testing and the malpractices followed by large pharmaceutical corporations
where harmful drugs are tested on poor and needy individuals without obtaining
their informed consent, the treatment of the subject and the fleshing out of
the story and characters is very different in the rival works. On comparing
the scripts as a whole, there does not appear to be substantial similarity
between the two works. The entire plot of the two flms and the story line is
very different.
24\. The crucial points of distinction between the two flms is that the story
of the Plaintiff revolves around the personal struggle of the protagonist who
and nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020
02:58:52 ::: 37 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc whose family are victim of an
illegal drug trial. The story revolves around the death of the mother of the
protagonist being caused due to drug testing, a drunkard father and the family
problems, which are absent in the Defendantsf flm. The character of the uncle
and the mentor and their deceitful actions of enticing the mother of the
protagonist to undergo drug trials and the shock and the emotional distress
that the protagonist faces on account of the betrayal of her trusted persons
i.e. mentor and her uncle are also absent in the Defendantsf flm. This is one
of the main reasons that the protagonist in the Plaintifffs flm becomes
determined to take on the pharmaceutical company and it is to a great extent a
personal fght for the protagonist in the Plaintifffs flm. This storyline is
the substance of the Plaintifffs play and is extremely crucial in the
Plaintifffs flm. This entire story line is absent in the Defendantsf flm. The
Defendantsf flm is about the journey of a small town girl who had a very happy
childhood. Her journey is from being a small town girl with dreams and
aspiration to becoming a very successful model in Mumbai. This transition is
also emphasized. The entire glamour element and the character of a beauty
contest winner, who is one of the protagonists, and the manner of her
association with the pharmaceutical company because of her obligation to
endorse the drug as a beauty contest winner, is completely different. Though
there is a character of a journalist in the Plaintifffs flm, the character is
shown as the boyfriend of the protagonist and is completely different from the
character of the journalist based in England in the Defendantsf flm who is
nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52
::: 38 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc unrelated to any of the protagonists and
is on a mission to bring out the truth about malpractices of pharmaceutical
corporations before the world and is eventually murdered in this pursuit. The
court case in the Plaintifffs flm is very dramatic with the uncle and mentor
of the protagonist being a part of the Court room drama, there are seuuences
of attempted hit and run and eventually the protagonist and her boyfriend
Arjun are successful in putting the CEO of the pharmaceutical corporation, the
uncle of the protagonist behind bars, before the Honfble Supreme Court. As
against this, in the Defendantsf flm, the Court case is not initiated by the
protagonist but by the ad-agency of the pharmaceutical corporation for
defamation and breach of contract, which the protagonist successfully defends,
and the company withdraws the case in the Court of frst instance.
25\. I have seen the pictures of some characters in the Defendantsf flm
particularly Dr. Bali who is said to be based on the real life person Dr.
Satinath Sarangi and fnd that there is a striking similarity. The Defendants
have produced material like photographs to substantiate that the crucial
characters of their flm Mia Banerjee, Dr. Bali and Ms. Eliza Moore are
inspired from real life characters of Reita Powell, Dr. Satinath Sarangi and
Ms. Zeina Awad respectively. The portrayal and manner of appearance of these
characters in the Defendantsf flm do prima facie show that these characters
are inspired on real life persons. The Plaintiff has criticized this
contention by stating differences in the real life person and the character in
the flm. If a character nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on
- 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 39 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc of a flm is inspired
by a real life person, it is not necessary that the entirety of that personfs
personality should be reproduced.
26\. The differences between the rival works cannot be said to be trivial or
inconseuuential or deliberate as an attempt to escape an allegation of copying
as sought to be contended by the Plaintiff. The differences are material and
change the nature of the rival works. The comparisons drawn by the Plaintiff
and the reliance placed by the Plaintiff on the Afdavit in Reply as an alleged
admission of similarities does not advance the case of the Plaintiff any
further. The Plaintiff has sought to dissect the rival works into fragments of
unprotectable elements. The presence of common elements like a common plot
line of unethical drug testing, a Court case, nationwide movements against the
illegalities committed by the pharmaceutical company, the depiction of death
of children as a result of drug testing, do not by themselves individually or
taken together establish substantial copying. The comparisons drawn by the
Plaintiff are extremely strained and, in some cases, not correct, like the
allegation of presence of a mentor in the Defendantsf flm. At some places, the
Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Bali is the mentor of Mia in the Defendantsf flm
and at other places, Mr. Rahul Sharma, who owns a newspaper is claimed to be
the mentor. Then again, one Sharon is alleged to be the other mentor. Scenes
of people crying on the happening of an unfortunate event like death are
claimed to be similar. In my view, the comparisons drawn are extremely
strained by dissecting the rival nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 :::
Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 40 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc works
into a series of unprotectable elements. On this basis, I am not dealing in
detail with the charts of similarities/dissimilarities presented by the
parties. This is not permissible in determining infringement of copyright and
the Plaintiff has failed to prima facie prove any similarities in the
substance or protectable elements in the rival works. In the Written
Submissions, the Plaintiff has sought to cull out the essential features from
the various reviews printed. I do not fnd that the same is a correct analysis
of the reports. In any case, I have reached the view taken by me after seeing
the flm and play and also considering the scripts.
27\. As regards the screenplay of the cinematographic flm, which the Plaintiff
claims to have worked on in or about June 2016, the same was fled in a sealed
cover in this Court. However, the Plaintiff did not provide a copy of the same
to the Defendants on the ground that the same is confdential. In any case,
apart from fling the script in Court, no reference was made to the same in the
course of arguments except stating that the Plaintiff worked on the
screenplay. In any case, the Plaintiff claims to have worked on the screenplay
in or about June 2016 which is much subseuuent. In such circumstances, it is
not open to the Plaintiff to rely on the same. In any case, I have seen the
screenplay and in light of my observations hereinabove, the same does not
advance the case of the Plaintiff.
28\. The learned Advocate for the Plaintiff strongly contended that the
Defendants have admitted to several similarities and has even sought to
analyze the nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 16/01/2020
02:58:52 ::: 41 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc said response in the said Written
Submissions. The said Chart does not tantamount to any admission and in fact
when the chart is read in its entirety, it is apparent that the Defendants
have denied similarities and highlighted differences. In any case, such a
dissected analysis as sought to be done by the Plaintiff is not the test to be
applied in a case for infringement of a copyright.
29\. It is also contended by the Plaintiff that the Defendants have not shown
any evidence of the Defendants having put in any labour and that there is no
evidence having consulted any common source. In the Afdavit in Reply fled by
the Defendants, it is categorically stated by Defendant No.1 that the story,
script, screenplay and dialogues of the flm were written by Defendant No.1 and
one Sanyukta Roy after years of laborious research and labour. It is also
contended that Defendant No.1 has interviewed several activists, doctors,
victims etc. and tried making the Defendants flm as close to reality as
possible. It is also the contention of the Defendants that the Defendants have
also based some of the characters in the flm based on real life personalities.
Merely because various material had been printed in 2017 for production in
court does not mean that the same could not have been accessed earlier. Thus,
this contention of the Plaintiff is clearly devoid of merits.
30\. The Plaintiff has relied upon the judgments in the case of Osbrone and
Govindan (supra) to contend that the Defendants have failed to provide any
explanation for the presence of similarities and the burden is on the
Defendants to nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 42 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc prove that they have
referred to independent sources and expended independent labour and skill to
arrive at their work. Firstly, prima facie the rival works do not contain any
substantial similarities or similarities in protectable elements. Secondly,
the Defendants have in the present case produced material like Rajya Sabha
reports and recommendations on the alleged irregularities in the conduct of
studies using HIV virus, news articles on the internet with reference to a
specifc scene and the June 2010 issue of Asian Bioethics Review which records
that Tsunami victims have been experimented upon. The Defendants have stated
that the authors have referred to these materials while working on the script.
There appears to be material in the public domain on the theme/plot of the
rival works. In any case, there cannot be a monopoly on a theme of illegal
drug trial or big pharmaceutical companies indulging in it. The works are not
substantially similar. Having seen the flm, the video recording of the play
and having read the scripts, I do not get an impression that the Defendantsf
work is a reproduction of the Plaintifffs work, leave alone a substantial
reproduction. The treatment and presentation and the storyline and plot of the
two stories are very distinct and different. I do not fnd on reading the
scripts and watching the play and flm that one would walk away with an
unmistakable impression that the Defendantsf flm is substantially and
materially a copy of the Plaintifffs work. In my view the Defendants have
prima facie proved that their work is original and has been independently
arrived at.

31\. As far as the Plaintifffs contention of deletion of a scene, it has been
contended that in the Plaintifffs flm Dr. Pereira and the uncle of the
protagonist Ralph Fernandes drink together, whereas in the Defendantsf flm
also some people are sitting and drinking together. The Defendants have
explained that the scene in the Defendantsf flm is where a media baron, who
fled a case against Mia along with his legal counsel, and the Judge are
sitting together and having a drink while the case is pending. It is stated by
the Defendants that this scene was deleted pursuant to objections being taken
by the Censor Board which was apparently because it showed an inappropriate
interaction between a lawyer and a judge. In my view, these scenes cannot be
said to be similar and in any case are not protectable elements in any work.
Scenes of devious persons sitting together to plot against the protagonist is
not uncommon. The deletion of the scene has been explained by the Defendants
and their explanation cannot be brushed aside. The mere deletion of the scene
even when taken in conjunction with the other factors argued by the Plaintiff,
do not take the case of the Plaintiff much further.
32\. The Defendantsf reliance on the judgment in the case of Mansoob Haider v.
Yashraj Films (supra) is also apposite. Though access by the Defendants to the
Plaintifffs work is not necessary for grant of reliefs in an action for
copyright infringement, it is one of the factors that the court must take into
consideration while granting reliefs. Without access to the Plaintifffs work
the degree of proof reuuired to nitin  ::: Uploaded on - 15/01/2020 :::
Downloaded on - 16/01/2020 02:58:52 ::: 44 / 45 NMCD-568-2017-FINAL.doc
establish an allegation of copying is much higher on the Plaintiff. In the
present case, the Plaintiff has contended that the script of the flm was
shared with some people from the flm industry, however, the Plaintiff has been
unable to show access of the same uua the Defendants. In fact, there is no
direct allegation to that effect. The last evolution of the script of the flm
has not even been shared by the Plaintiff or produced before the court as the
same is claimed to be confdential.
33\. As far as the allegation that the script of the play has been
substantially copied in the Defendantsf flm, it is true that the play has been
publicly performed on several occasions since 2007. However, the script of the
play is all the more different from the Defendantsf flm. In fact, the
Plaintiff herself recognizes that the script of the Plaintifffs play is
different from the script of the Plaintifffs flm with respect to certain key
elements, which form a major portion of the Plaintifffs flm. In the play, the
protagonist commits suicide and the entire court room drama, events
surrounding the same, change of heart of the uncle who takes a bullet for the
protagonist are absent. The Plaintifffs play and flm have a common genesis but
are uuite apart. The Defendantsf flm is that much further away from the
Plaintifffs play. The common theme of unethical drug testing remains. But, as
stated above there cannot be copyright in an idea. The expression of the idea
is completely different in the Plaintifffs play and the Defendantsf flm. The
Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case of infringement of
copyright by the Defendants in the script of the Plaintifffs nitin  :::

34\. In light of the aforesaid, the balance of convenience is strongly in
favour of the Defendants. The Defendantsf flm has been ready for release for a
long time and any continuation of ad interim reliefs will cause grave
prejudice to the Defendants.
