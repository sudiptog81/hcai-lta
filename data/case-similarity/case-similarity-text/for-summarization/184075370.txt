themselves can hardly ever sustain charge of wilful mis-statement or
suppression of facts in-as-much-as in case of a bona fide belief regarding
non-taxability, no assessee would file returns or obtain registration. In case
of CCE Vs. Chemphar Drugs Liniments [2002-TIOL-266-SC-CX], the Supreme Court
held that something positive other than mere inaction or failure on the
assessees part or conscious withholding of information when assessee knew
otherwise is required for invoking extended period. Thus, we are of the view
that the allegation of suppression of facts cannot be sustained in the given
circumstances. Consequently, penalty under Section 78 ibid is not imposable.
7\. In the light of the analysis above, we allow the appeal by way of remand
to the adjudicating authority with the following findings/directions:-
(i) We hold that the appellant provided franchise service.
(ii) The extended period is not invocable.
(iii) Penalty under Section 78 ibid cannot be imposed.
(iv) The impugned demand has to be re-computed only for the normal period and
taking the assessable value as equal to the aggregate amount collected by the

Appearance Mr. Prabhat Kumar, Adv. - for the Appellant Mr. Govind Dixit, DR -
for the respondent CORAM: Honble Justice G. Raghuram, President Honble Mr.
R.K. Singh, Member (Technical) Final Order No.53817/2015, dated 23.12.2015 Per
Mr. R.K. Singh :
Appeal has been filed against Order-in-Original No.106-07/LDH/2013, dated
19.12.2013 in terms of which service tax demand of Rs.1,44,14,31,243/- for the
period October, 2006 to June, 2012 was confirmed along with interest and
penalties under Franchise Service [Section 65 (47/48/105 (zze) of the
Finance Act, 1994].
2\. Brief facts of the case are as under:-
The appellant, Punjab Technical University (PTU), is a university established
under the Punjab Technical University Act, 1996. It is a statutory body which
runs its own colleges/affiliated colleges and distance education programme
through more than 2100 Learning Centres (LCs). It provides courses leading to
degree/diploma in engineering, management, architecture, paramedical and
various other programmes. The appellant designed its distance education
programme and created a 3-tier architecture for running the same (i.e.
distance education programme) through LCs (3rd tier) which were to be
supervised by Regional Centres (RCs) (2nd tier). The Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) entered into by the appellant with LCs/ RCs lists out
obligations of the appellant, RCs and LCs. The ground for confirmation of
demand is that the appellant rendered Franchisor Service to its RCs and LCs
and the entire fee received by it (under various heads like admission fee,
examination fee, miscellaneous fees/late fee, result/certificate fee,
challenge checking fee, migration fee, M Tech Viva, Thesis Fee, Scholarship
fee, inspection fee, recovery, etc.) from its students enrolled at LCs was the
assessable value for charging service tax under the said service.
3\. Ld. Advocate for the appellant contended that
(i) None of the ingredients of franchise service are present in the present
case. It was imparting education through Learning Centres (LCs). There is no
franchise agreement and there is only an MOU with LCs/RCs.
(ii) It has not granted any representational right to its LCs and it is more
in the nature of public-private partnership.
(iii) It has kept with itself the essential institutional provisions of a
university like determination of eligibility of students, allotment of
enrolment numbers to eligible students, preparation of syllabus, preparation
of question papers, evaluation of answer sheets, awarding of degrees, diplomas
under its seal which are duly recognised and approved by the AICTE.
(iv) RCs/LCs are under strict control of the appellant and they simply carried
out the activities of teaching as per its guidelines. It laid down all the
requisite norms which are implemented by LCs to ensure that quality education
was imparted by LCs to the students. None of the obligations of the appellant
stipulated in the MOU indicate that it was providing any service to RCs/LCs
and it is RCs/LCs, which were providing service to the appellant.
(v) RCs and LCs were performing appellants functions in remote areas without
having any representational rights.
(vi) LCs were at par with affiliated colleges of the appellant and therefore
cannot be discriminated against vis-a-vis affiliated colleges.
(vii) The service rendered by appellant is education service, which is
exempted.
(viii) The impugned services are on negative list after 01.06.2012.
(ix) It cited the clarification contained in education guide issued by CBEC.
(x) The adjudicating authority relied upon the judgement of CESTAT in the case
of Speed and Safe Courier Vs. Commissioner[2008 (13) STT 257 (Tri.-Bang)] but
that judgment was overturned by Kerala High Court [2010 (18) STR 550 (Ker)].
(xi) The MOUs entered into by the appellant with LCs can be called joint
venture agreement and not franchise agreement.
(xii) The entire fee collected by the appellant is taken as taxable service
while as per the agreement, the appellant paid certain percentage to LCs/RCs
out of the fee collected. The share of appellant normally varied from 28% to
37% of the total fee collected. If at all, only authorisation fee / additional
authorisation fee collected by appellant should be treated as value of
franchise service which will reduce the demand to Rs.5,86,003/- after cum-tax
benefit, as shown in para 36 of grounds of appeal.
(xiii) The extended period in this case is not invokable as there is no
suppression of facts or wilful mis-statement and these activities of the
appellant were made public even on its website.
(xiv) The facts of this case are not similar to the case of DPS Vs. CST [2013
(32) STR 179 (Tri.-Del)] decided by CESTAT.
(xv) It cited in its support judgments of CESTAT in the cases of Franch
Express Network Vs. CST, Chennai [2008 (12) STR 370 (Tri.-Chennai)] and
Bonanza Speed Couriers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. CCE, Cochin [2010 (19) STR 675
(Tri.-Bang.)].
(xvi) Revenue has failed to show any trade mark, service mark, or logo or any
such symbol of the appellant, which was used by LCs for providing service,
which is an essential ingredient for franchise service.
3\. Ld. Departmental Representative, on the other hand stated that (i) the MOU
entered between the appellant and LCs clearly shows that it satisfies all
ingredients of franchise agreement and LCs had representational rights. (ii)
The MOU clearly specified obligations of the respective parties and LCs have
been given representational rights of the appellant including brand name,
service mark or logo. (iii) Merely because fee was collected in the name of
the appellant and the appellant made some payments to RCs is not of any
consequence in-as-much-as the manner of payment to LCs for the service
rendered is merely a matter of detail. (iv) The appellant authorised LCs to
conduct courses on its behalf and RCs and LCs acted as agent on behalf of the
appellant. (v) RCs were under obligation to conduct marketing/ advertisement
campaign and brand promotion of the appellants courses. (vi) LCs and RCs were
under obligation to display the name of the appellant to show their
association with the appellant to general public. (vii) The gross value
charged by the appellant is rightly taken as assessable value. (viii) The
judgment of CESTAT in the case of DPS Vs. CST, Delhi (supra) is applicable to
the present case. Revenue also cited the CESTAT judgement in Amway India
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. Vs. CST, Delhi [Final Order No.ST/A/51612/2015-CU[DB],
dated 14.05.2015] in its support. (ix) The extended period is invokable
because the appellant did not take registration nor paid service tax and also
did not submit figures when asked for.
4\. We have considered the contentions of both sides and perused the records.
The following issues are involved in this case:-
(i) Classification of service (allegedly) rendered by the appellant under the
Finance Act, 1994.
(ii) Valuation of service for levy of service tax (in case the service is held
to be classifiable as franchise service).
(iii) Whether extended period of limitation is invocable in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
(iv) Whether penalty is leviable on the appellant.
A careful scrutiny of the MOU entered into between PTU and RCs/LCs is
necessary for deciding classification of service. Therefore, it is
facilitative to reproduce a typical MOU and definition of franchise given in
Section 65 (47) of the Finance Act, 1994, which is done below:-

by the appellant. The examination, evaluation, declaration of results and
award of degrees are also the obligations of the appellant. The appellant lays
down infrastructural requirements to be adhered to by LCs. It also lays down
the eligibility criteria for the faculty and staff to be engaged by LCs and
the requisite norms to be implemented by LCs to ensure impart of quality
education by LCs to the students enrolled by the appellant in authorised
courses. Correspondingly, obligations of LCs, as mentioned in MOU reproduced
above, clearly show that they have to abide by the terms and conditions
specified in the MOU. The agreement clearly provides that LCs are duly
authorised by the appellant to engage in providing training/education by
offering appellants various approved distance education courses of IT and
non-IT streams and other related fields, strictly as per the commands and
norms of the appellant to enable the students of the appellant enrolled with
them to get skill based training leading to the award of degrees/diplomas of
the appellant by the distance education mode in the concerned courses. The
appellant ensures that LCs provide proper and quality education to the
students of the appellant in accordance with the norms and standards laid down
by the appellant for the skill based learning leading to the award of degrees
/ diplomas by the appellant in the concerned courses / streams through the
distance education mode.
From the foregoing there remains no doubt that LCs were authorised to take
students by claiming and making it clear that the education they were
providing was on behalf of the appellant. They were allowed even to advertise
to that effect. It was because LCs were representing the appellant with regard
to providing education, that the MOU cast strict obligations on LCs to ensure
that the quality of education remained as per the standards of the appellant.
It also comes out from the MOU that RCs framed marketing strategies to be
implemented by LCs in consultation with the appellant. As per the MOU, the
format and style of any advertisement or hoarding to be placed by RCs/LCs had
to be done with the prior written approval of the appellant lest these bring
down or cast aspersions on or discredit the appellant. Owing to the fact that
LCs represented the appellant with regard to providing education, MOU laid
down strict requirements of infrastructure, processes, qualifications of
staff, etc. as elaborated in the MOU. Though the MOU states that it is not a
franchise arrangement and is a model of public-private partnership for
deciding classification of the service rendered thereunder, we have to see the
nature, terms and conditions thereof; it is immaterial as to what nomenclature
is assigned to it. Thus, notwithstanding that the MOU states that it is not a
franchise agreement, the aforesaid analysis leaves no doubt that it satisfies
all ingredients of franchise as defined in Section 65 (47) of the Finance Act,
1944 in-as-much-as LCs were granted representational rights to provide service
and to undertake various activities identified with the appellant. The
contention of the appellant that franchise has to involve trade mark, service
mark, trade name or logo or any other such symbol is untenable as the
definition of franchise given in Section 65(47) ibid quoted earlier clearly
states that these may not be involved. In the case of Global Transgene Ltd.
Vs. CCEST, Aurangabad [2013 (32) STR 179 (Tri.-Del.)], CESTAT has held that
admittedly in a franchisee transaction, the franchisee loses his individual
identity and represent the identity of the franchisor to the outside world, as
in the case of McDonald the customers are not concerned with who owns the
McDonalds restaurant (franchisee). The customers identify it with McDonald
(the franchisor). In the present case also, a student is hardly much
concerned as to which LC he joins because each LC provides education as per
the norms and requirements laid down by the appellant and he gets a degree of
and from the appellant. Ld. advocate referred to the judgement of Kerala High
Court in the cases of Speed and Safe Courier Service Vs. Commissioner (supra)
and Franch Express Network (supra).
In the case of Speed and Safe Couriers Service (supra), the Hon'ble Kerala
High Court found that double assessment of charges was made and held that
there was no statutory provision to tax the same service charges twice. Thus,
the ratio of this judgment has no relevance to the present case. In the case
of Franch Express Network (supra) cited by the appellant, it was found that
the agreement indicated that representational right was not granted (which is
not the case in respect of the MOU under consideration). In case of Bonanza
Speed Couriers (supra), cited by the appellant, CESTAT interpreted the
definition of franchise as it existed prior to 16.06.2005 and therefore the
said judgement is not germane to the issue in the present case. On the other
hand, we find that the facts in the case of DPS Vs. CST, Delhi (supra), where
CESTAT held that there was rendition of franchise service by DPS, are pretty
similar to facts in the present case in-as-much-as as in that case also, the
appellant provided concepts of business operation to the franchisee including
know-how, method of operation, managerial expertise, etc. Further, the
definition of franchise as applicable to the present case is much wider than
the definition which existed during the period covered by the DPS case
(supra), making the ratio of the DPS judgment squarely applicable (and more)
to the present case. Indeed, the MOU in question is so clear an example of
franchise as defined in Section 65 (47) ibid that any further elaboration on
this point will be an exercise in over-kill.
5\. Coming to the aspect of valuation of service, we find force in the
contention of the appellant that the entire fee collected by LCs in the name
of the appellant cannot be treated as assessable value of franchise service.
We note that out of the total fee collected by the appellant through LCs, a
part was given back to LCs. Obviously, the part of the collection which was
given back by the appellant to LCs cannot form part of the assessable value
for the purpose of taxability. As per Section 67 ibid, the value of taxable
service is the gross amount charged by the service provider for such service
and gross amount will be only the amount, which remained with the appellant
after payments to LCs. However, the contention of the ld. advocate that only
authorisation fee and additional authorisation fee should be taken as a
consideration for the service rendered is untenable, because the valuation for
the impugned service is to be done in accordance with the provisions of
Section 67 ibid, which, to repeal, in effect, states that the value of the
taxable service will be the gross amount charged for the service and the gross
amount charged by the appellant for the service rendered has to be equal to
the amount collected by the appellant from LCs minus the amount paid by it to
LCs. It is pertinent to mention that the amount paid by the appellant to RCs
would not be excludible from the assessable value, because the RCs were
created by the appellant to ensure that LCs acted as per the MOU, the
franchise service was properly monitored and suitably promoted and for certain
other purposes as mentioned in MOU. Thus, the amount paid to RCs by the
appellant was an expense at the hands of the appellant in connection of
provision of franchise service. For the sake of elucidation, for example, the
appellant could as well have employed its own persons for doing what RCs did
in which case the expenses incurred in doing so would not be deductible from
the assessable value. Thus, the amount paid by the appellant to RCs is not
excludible from the assessable value.
6\. The appellant has contended that the extended period in this case is not
invocable as there was no suppression or wilful mis-statement. It stated that
the figures asked for were also given within a months time. We find that in
the Show Cause Notice, the invocation of the extended period is proposed in
the following terms:-
13. The Noticee during the relevant periods neither got themselves registered
with the Department nor paid the appropriate service tax on the services
provided by them. The Noticee also did not file the returns prescribed as per
law with the Department. Thus they have suppressed the fact of providing the
taxable service from the Department with an intent to evade payment of service
tax and have violated the provisions of Section 66, 68, 69 and 70 of the Act
read with Rule 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Rules. By these acts of omission and
commission, they have rendered themselves liable to penal action under Section
76, 77 & 78 of the Act.
14\. The extended period of limitation of five years as provided under proviso
to Section 73(1) is clearly invokable in this case as the Noticee had
suppressed the fact of providing the taxable service from the Department with
an intent to evade payment of service tax and had the department not gathered
the information on their own about the services provided by the Noticee, this
huge evasion of service tax would not have come to the Notice of the
Department as the Noticee neither got themselves registered with the
Department nor filed the prescribed returns during the relevant period as
required under the law. The appellant was established under Punjab Technical
University Act, 1996 and started distance education programme through LCs in
terms of the guidelines issued by University Grants Commission (UGC). The
details of such programme were advertised and also displayed on its website.
It entered into MOUs with almost 1,000 LCs. In these circumstances, the
allegation that it suppressed this activity or indulged in wilful mis-
statement is simply preposterous. In the case of Continental Foundation Jt.
Venture Vs. CCE, Chandigarh-I [2007 (216) ELT 177 (SC)], the Supreme Court
observed that an incorrect statement cannot be equated with a wilful mis-
statement - There cannot be suppression or mis-statement of fact, which is not
wilful and yet constitute a permissible ground for purpose of proviso to
Section 11A ibid - Mis-statement of fact must be wilful. Also in the case of
Nestle India Ltd. Vs. CCE, Chandigarh [2009 (235) ELT 577 (SC)], the Supreme
Court held that extended period invokable only when there is positive act
other than mere inaction or failure on the part of manufacturer and there must
be conscious or deliberate withholding of information by manufacturer. While
there are bland statements made in the Show Cause Notice alleging wilful mis-
statement/suppression of facts, there is no evidence adduced in support
thereof. Non-payment of service tax/non-obtaining of registration by
themselves can hardly ever sustain charge of wilful mis-statement or
suppression of facts in-as-much-as in case of a bona fide belief regarding
non-taxability, no assessee would file returns or obtain registration. In case
of CCE Vs. Chemphar Drugs Liniments [2002-TIOL-266-SC-CX], the Supreme Court
held that something positive other than mere inaction or failure on the
assessees part or conscious withholding of information when assessee knew
otherwise is required for invoking extended period. Thus, we are of the view
that the allegation of suppression of facts cannot be sustained in the given
circumstances. Consequently, penalty under Section 78 ibid is not imposable.
7\. In the light of the analysis above, we allow the appeal by way of remand
to the adjudicating authority with the following findings/directions:-
(i) We hold that the appellant provided franchise service.
(ii) The extended period is not invocable.
(iii) Penalty under Section 78 ibid cannot be imposed.
(iv) The impugned demand has to be re-computed only for the normal period and
taking the assessable value as equal to the aggregate amount collected by the
appellant through LCs minus the amount paid to LCs. Needless to say that the
amount of penalty under Section 76 ibid has also to be re-computed.
