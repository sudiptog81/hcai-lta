PER R.K. PANDA, AM:
The above two appeals filed by the Revenue are directed against the separate
orders dated 30th May, 2017 of the CIT(A)-3, New Delhi relating to assessment
years 2013-14 and 2014-15, respectively.
2\. Since common issues are involved in both these appeals, therefore, these
were heard together and are being disposed of by this common order.
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 ITA No.5274/Del/2017 (A.Y. 2013-14)
3\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Ebix Singapore Pvt. Ltd. and is engaged in the business of
rendering information technology/information technology enabled services
(IT/ITES). It filed its return of income on 30.11.2013 declaring nil income
after claiming deduction of Rs.226,98,41,758/- under section 10AA of the IT
Act. However, the assessee has paid tax u/s 115JB on book profit of
Rs.205,06,58,504/-. Since the assessee had entered into certain international
transaction, the AO referred the matter to the TPO for determination of the
ALP of the international transaction. However, the TPO did not draw any
adverse inference in respect of such international transaction undertaken by
the assessee. So far as the other issues are concerned, the AO, after
considering the various replies given by the assessee, rejected the claim of
deduction u/s 10AA of the Act made by the assessee in respect of income from
six SEZ units and made addition of Rs.226,98,41,758/-. Similarly, the AO made
addition of Rs.82,88,099/- on account of other income from four SEZ units. The
AO further made addition of Rs.8,40,46,029/- by rejecting the claim of
depreciation on goodwill. Thus, the AO determined the total income of the
assessee at Rs.212,44,62,496/-.
4\. In appeal, the ld.CIT(A) deleted the additions made by the AO.
5\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.

ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
6\. Ground of appeal No.1 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> "1. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs. 2,26,98,41,758/- made by the AO
> on account of business income from 6 units."
6.1 So far as ground No.1 is concerned, the facts of the case, in brief, are
that the assessee has claimed deduction of Rs.226,98,41,758/- u/s 10AA of the
Act in respect of four eligible business undertakings, i.e., Noida SEZ, Nagpur
SEZ, Coimbatore SEZ and Hyderabad SEZ, the details of which are as under:-
          Sr.     Name of undertaking              Amount
          No
          1       Noida SEZ                        209,44,51,574
                                                   4,88,88,288
          2
                  Nagpur SEZ (89-90)
          3       Coimbatore SEZ                   4,42,95,190
          4       Hyderabad SEZ                    8,25,79,324
                  Total                            227,02,14,376
7\. However, the deduction claimed was restricted to the total income of
Rs.226,98,41,758/- as against the total profit of Rs.227,02,14,376/-. The
unitwise break-up of deduction claimed by the assessee company as exempt u/s
10AA for SEZ units is as under:-
3
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 4 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
8\. The AO asked the assessee to explain the allowability of deduction u/s
10AA of the Act to which the assessee furnished the following submissions.
> "Also attached is the consolidated and unit wise computation of income
> containing working of all income tax adjustment of revenue and expenses of
> each taxable and non-taxable unit. As can be seen from the Computation of
> Income that the inadmissible expenses of Non-SEZ unit Chennai have been
> added back and there is no loss to the Revenue as the Assessee has paid
> taxes under the provisions of MAT since tax payable as per MAT is more than
> the tax payable as per normal provisions of the Act, Expenses of Hyderabad
> unit were not added in the light of the CBDT circular dated 16.07.2013
> wherein Assessee can set off losses of ineligible units against the profits
> of eligible units. Copy of the circular is attached herewith for your
> reference as Annexure B, without prejudice to the above, even if expenses of
> Hyderabad unit are added back there would be no revenue loss as tax payable
> as per the MAT provisions would be more than the tax payable as per normal
> provisions........" Furthermore, all the employees which were forming part
> of these two units in preceding assessment year continued to remain
> employees of these two units during the subject year under assessment,
> except for routine hiring and exit of employees in the normal course of
> business operations.
5
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Further, there has been no transfer of
> employees by the Assessee from any other business units to these two
> business units during the subject year under assessment. During the subject
> year under assessment, these two units were continuing business operations
> carried forward from the previous year, and there has been no splitting or
> reconstruction of these business units during the previous year under
> assessment.......... "
> "........Both, Coimbatore and Hyderabad SEZ units were initially set-up by
> Planet in the F. Y. 2010-11 and F.Y. 2011-12 respectively and commenced
> business operations in respective years of set-up. Assessee acquired
> business Operations from Planet on a going concern business in F.Y. 2012-
> 13, and has accordingly claimed deduction ids I0AA in respect of two units
> in its tax return for the subject year assessment. These two business units
> are engaged in export of services i.e. provision of IT (software development
> support) to Ebix group outside India, which is permitted business activity
> under SEZ and fur claim of tax holiday u/s 10AA of the Act. "
9\. However, the AO was not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the
assessee. He observed that the claim of the assessee that expenses of non-SEZ
units of Chennai has been added back is incorrect. According to him, the total
added back is Rs.22,14,995/- (i.e., Rs.19,14,995/- in Noida unit and Rs.3
lakhs in Coimbatore Unit). Thus, the entire expenses have not been added back
and this is a clear admission on the part of the assessee that resources of
non-SEZ units have been used for the earning of revenue in SEZ units.
According to the AO, the claim of expenses of Hyderabad non-SEZ unit can be
set off against the eligible profits of SEZ unit is also not verifiable from
the computation. The AO analysed the reply of the assessee furnished in the
simultaneous proceedings for A.Y. 2014-15 wherein the following depreciation
chart was furnished:-
         (i)      NOIDA DTA                25,04,762
         (ii)     NOIDA SEZ              2,15,25,021
         (iii)    Nagpur SEZ               13,56,105
                                                  6
                                                                   ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
          (iv)     Chennai DTA            10,05,546
          (v)      Begumpet DTA         3,23,00,959
          (vi)    Coimbatore SEZ        2,11,70,027 (including Depreciation of
                                        Rs.1,91,76,128/- on Goodwill)
          (vii) Uppal SEZ               1,74,89,944 (including Depreciation of
                                        Rs.1,71,07,849/-on Goodwill)
10\. He observed that the assessee company has registered office at 311-B-4A,
Pariyattan Vihar, Vasundhara Enclave, New Delhi and there is separate
workplace at Noida DTA. He observed that the expenses related to these offices
are not eligible for being considered with any SEZ units. According to the AO,
these expenses have not been claimed separately and, therefore, they have been
clubbed with the expenses of Noida, SEZ. This according to him, is not
allowable for deduction u/s 10AA of the Act as it amounts to splitting up
of/reconstruction of a business already in existence. From the reply furnished
by the assessee on 20th December, 2016, he noted that the assessee has
included other income of Rs.82,88,099/- in computation of profits on four SEZ
undertakings as under:
11\. He noted that Note No.23 of P & L Account of the company indicates that
other income includes Interest on Bank Deposits and Other Income. According to
the AO, this income of Rs.82,88,099/- cannot be considered as Profits & Gains
derived from the Export of Article/Things/ from Services as necessitated in
Section 10AA. He, therefore, held that this income is to be excluded from the
Profits of the  7 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Undertakings for Computation of
eligible Profits of the eligible Undertakings. He further noted that the
report in the Form 56F are also faulty to this extent.
12\. The AO further noted that during assessment year, the assessee company
has purchased one undertaking from M/s Planet Online Ltd. On being asked by
the AO to submit assessment history of M/s Planet Online Ltd. for the last
three years in respect of the allowability of deduction claimed by such
purchase unit, the assessee failed to demonstrate as to how the new SEZ unit
so acquired is not formed by splitting up or reconstruction of a business
already in existence and the SEZ unit has not been formed by the transfer of
previously used plant and machinery. He noted from the letter of transfer
dated 29th October, 2012 that the Development Commissioner has also mentioned
that tax liability may arise out of the changes that had to be fulfilled by
the respective companies. He further noted that in the consolidated
computation, the section 10AA exemption is Rs.226,98,41,758/- whereas in the
unitwise computation, the deduction u/s 10AA has been claimed at
Rs.227,02,14,376/-. Further, in the form No.3CD of audit report u/s 44AB of
the Act for A.Y. 2013-14, the admissible deduction u/s 10AA has not been
specified by the auditor and the difference in the claim has not been
explained by the assessee.
13\. The AO noted that in the consolidated computation, inadmissible expenses
of Rs.3,01,30,343/- for Chennai Non-SEZ unit and Rs.21,85,82,287/- for
Hyderabad DTA unit has been added back. However, in the unit-wise computation,
8 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Rs.19,14,995/- has been considered inadmissible
expenses of Non-SEZ unit and added back to the Business Income of NOIDA SEZ
unit. Similarly, for the Computation of Business Income of Coimbatore Unit
inadmissible expenses of Rs.2,04,54,537/- has been added back. The details of
these varying figures of inadmissible expenses has not been furnished by the
assessee. It also remain unexplained as to why there is a difference in the
consolidated computation and unit- wise computation.
14\. The AO noted that the Chennai and Hyderabad Non-SEZ units have incurred
losses of Rs.3,16,90,329/- and Rs.l ,95,89,28,585/- respectively. He noted
that Chennai unit has not even shown any Revenue against the claim of losses
which is prima facie indicator of fictitious arrangement in which the entire
resources of Chennai unit have been utilized in earning the tax free income of
SEZ units. Similarly, the claim of expenses of Rs.21,86,67,174/- (including
Rs. 15.00,35,220/- for Employee Benefit Expenses) as against revenue of
Rs.2.27,74,589/- is not justifiable.
15\. The AO observed that in the NOIDA SEZ, the assessee has earned Revenue
from operations of Rs.221.57 Crores as against Employee Benefit Expense of Rs.
18.28 Crore, whereas, in the Non-SEZ units this ratio of Revenue to Employee
Benefit Expense is very high. This-again indicates that the Resources of Non-
SEZ units have been utilized for the tax free income of SEZ units. The AO
analysed the  9 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Employee Benefit Expenses as
compared to Revenue from Operations of each unit which is as under:~ Name of
the Unit Revenue from Employee Benefit % of EBE to Revenue Operations Expenses
(EBE) from Operations NOIDA SEZ (Ebix 221.57 18.28 8.25% SEZ) NAGPUR SEZ (Ebix
1.0,00 4.64 46.4% SEZ) fO-MBATORh SEZ 14.1 1 5.34 37.84% (Planet Online) Uppal
SEZ (Planet 16.72 5.05 30.20% Online) Chennai Non SEZ NIL 1.88 Infinite
Hyderabad Non SEZ 2.27 15.00 660.79% (Planet Online)
16\. From the above table, he observed that the Employee Benefit Expenses of
SEZ Unit's range from 8.25% to 46.4% as against the 660.79% and Infinite % in
the case of Hyderabad and Chennai Non-SEZ Units. This unusually high Employee
Benefit Expense according to him indicates that these expenses were incurred
for the earning of revenue in 10AA claiming SEZ Units. Since, the Employees
have earned revenue for SEZ Units, they have also utilized other resources of
Non-SEZ Units in doing so. This will tantamount to use of resources of non-
eligible already existing unit for earning revenue for SEZ units. Such
arrangement according to the AO is colorable and are merely to avail benefits
of deduction u/s 10AA.
17\. The AO analysed the provisions of Section 10AA according to which the
undertaking which is formed by splitting up or the reconstruction of business
already in existence shall not be eligible for deduction under 10AA. He noted
that  10 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 there were expenses of Non-SEZ units
which were used for earning income of SEZ units is admitted by the assessee
itself in the form of Computation of Income submitted by it. Further, the
assessee failed to submit satisfactory details and justification in respect of
each unit that has claimed deduction u/s 10A. In view of the above, the AO
rejected the claim of deduction u/s 10AA made by the assessee.
18\. Before the CIT(A), the assessee made elaborate submissions on various
issues which were considered by the CIT(A). The AO was also present during the
proceedings was heard on the issue of disallowance of deduction u/s 10AA of
the Act. The relevant submission of the assessee justifying the claim of
deduction u/s 10AA before CIT(A) reads as under:-

Apart from the above, business activity of Ebix SEZ in domestic tariff area
(hereinafter referred to as "DTA") in Chennai (referred to as non-eligible
unit namely 'Chennai non-SEZ') was also amalgamated with the appellant
company. Moreover, under the scheme of composite arrangement, there was a de-
merger of the undertaking eligible for deduction u/s 10B of the Act of the
company at Noida engaged in providing BPO and support services to M/s. Premier
Ebix Exchange Software Pvt. Ltd. However, as a result, certain specified

That subsequently on 1.6.2012, the company entered into a business transfer
agreement (copy placed at pages 106-116 of Paper Book) with M/s. Planet Online
(P) Ltd. to purchase the business undertakings for a consideration of
Rs.38,53,50,000/- (USD 7 miilion) as on going concern on slump sale basis. The
business undertakings comprised of assets, transferred employees, liabilities,
licenses, contracts and receivables. -
3.5 As a result of the above, two eligible units at Coimbatore and Uppal stood
owned by the company and another non eligible unit at Hyderabad also stood
acquired by the company.
3.6 In the nutshell, as a result of the aforesaid, the company owned four
eligible units and two non eligible units during the assessment years 2013-14
and 2014-15. The details of the eligible units are as under:

Likewise, the status of non-eligible units was as under:

      No.                                                        assessment year

Apart from the above, the appellant had also certain assets as stated above
out of 10B Units which were retained by the company and classified as Noida
DTA, It is also clarified that during the instant year, expenditure claimed on
depreciation in respect of the said Noida DTA assets is of Rs. 52,74,157/-. A
copy of the chart of depreciation of assets of Noida DTA is placed at page 152
of the Paper Book.
At this juncture, it is stated that deduction has been claimed under section
10AA of the Act in respect of the four units eligible for the deduction and
details of the set up of the units and the status thereof is tabulated as

19\. It was reiterated that the disallowance was made by the AO based on
fundamental misconception of facts and circumstances. It was argued that the
assessee has maintained complete books of account which were duly audited and
14 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 have been accepted. In other words, the AO has
not rejected the books of account by invoking the provisions of section 145(3)
of the Act and the profit declared has been accepted. It was submitted that
when the AO has accepted separate books of account maintained by the assessee
company in each of the unit which are supported by audit report and,
therefore, the AO cannot allege that any expenditure of the revenue has been
diverted to other unit. It was submitted that even as per assessment order,
the AO has computed business income of each of undertaking separately, the
details of which are as under:-
                       Unit                    Amount of business income as per
            Sr

20\. It was argued that the taxable business income of the undertaking has
been computed independently and only thereafter taxable business income of the
company has been computed. Relying on various decisions, it was argued that
the AO is not justified in rejecting the claim of deduction. It was further
argued that the eligible undertaking of Noida and Nagpur stood amalgamated
with the assessee company during the assessment year 2012-13 and deduction
claimed thereon stood allowed as such and, therefore, there was no
justification for the AO to hold that such undertakings were not eligible for
the deduction in the A.Y. 2013-14.  15
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Referring to various decisions including the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Excel Industries
Ltd., 358 ITR 295 and in the case of CIT vs. JK Charitable Trust, 308 ITR 161,
it was argued that following the rule of consistency alone the AO should not
have rejected the claim of deduction in respect of Noida and Nagpur units.
21\. It was argued that all the four undertakings, i.e., Noida, Nagpur,
Coimbatore and Uppal were eligible for the deduction having been set up in the
preceding assessment years wherein deduction claimed stood duly allowed and,
therefore, there could have been no valid reason or justification to deny
claim of deduction in respect of these undertakings in the instant assessment
year. Relying on various decisions, it was argued that the amalgamation of the
undertaking could neither in law nor on facts be made a basis to deny the
legitimate claim of deduction and does not amount to splitting up or
reconstruction of business already in existence. The provisions of section
10AA(5) were brought to the notice of the CIT(A) and it was argued that the
above provision of the Act is an enabling provision to enable the claim of
deduction so as to transfer all the eligible unit to another unit in a scheme
of amalgamation or demerger. Relying on various decisions, it was argued that
acquisition of an undertaking on slump sale could neither in law nor on the
facts be made a basis to deny the legitimate claim of deduction. It was argued
that the change in ownership either by way of slump sale, merger or otherwise
cannot be made the basis to disallow the claim of deduction. It was argued
that fulfillment  16 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 of the conditions as
provided in sub-section (1) r.w. section 4 of section 10AA of the Act has to
be seen in the year of formation and since in the year of formation of the SEZ
units, units were eligible for the deduction, it cannot be said that such
units are not eligible for deduction u/s 10AA. Relying on the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bajaj Tempo Ltd. vs. CIT, 196 ITR 188, it
was argued that the conditions as prescribed in section 10AA(1) of the Act
r.w. sub-section (4) have to be seen in the year of formation of the unit and
not subsequently. The following details were furnished before the CIT(A)
regarding the assessment particulars and it was argued that the table given by
the AO at page 2, para 1 of the assessment order contains factually incorrect
observations:- "Sr. Unit reference Year of commen- Eligibility of unit No. of

           *Correct position in second year with assessee
22\. It was submitted that the Assessing Officer at page 3 of the order of
assessment in para 1 has incorrectly noted that in financial year 2012-13,
there was major change in undertaking owned by the company. He has incorrectly
noted that prior to this period, the assessee was only having business
undertaking at Noida and it is also only after composite scheme of arrangement
and business transfer agreement during the assessment year, the assessee
company owned six undertakings/units. The Assessing Officer has factually
erred in holding that the units of Noida and Nagpur came to be owned by the
company in the instant year. It is submitted that this finding is contrary to
his own observation at page 3 in para 3 of the order of assessment.
23\. Various inconsistencies and incorrect facts recorded by the AO were
brought to the notice of the CIT(A). It was submitted that the assessee while
computing the consolidated income has not only reduced the depreciation of SEZ
units, but also reduced the depreciation of non-SEZ units and while computing
the aggregate income the assessee reduced the entire claim of depreciation the
break-up of which is as under:-

24\. It was argued that while computing the aggregate income, the assessee
reduced the entire claim of depreciation both in respect of non-SEZ units and
SEZ units and computed the income at Rs. 226,98,41,758/- and as such,
restricted its claim of deduction to Rs.226,98,41,758/- as against eligible
claim of Rs.227,02,14,376/- pertaining to all the four units. In other words,
the entire expenditure has been reduced while computing the income of the
appellant company and no deduction has been claimed in excess to the gross
income declared by the company. It was stated that the de-merger of the
undertaking had taken place in assessment year 2012-13 and the appellant had
claimed depreciation on Noida DTA of Rs. 1,20,87,945/- which has been allowed
as such and likewise deduction was claimed of Rs. 144,89,55,220/- under
section 10AA of the Act in respect of Noida SEZ and same stood allowed under
section 143(3) of the Act. Thus, even otherwise, having accepted the demerger
of the BPO unit and having allowed depreciation in the preceding assessment
year and deduction under section 10AA of the Act, there was no justification
on the part of the Assessing Officer to make any departure and that too
without any material in the instant year.
25\. So far as the allegation of the AO that resources of non-SEZ units have
been used for earning the revenue in SEZ units is concerned, it was argued
that the same  19 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 is factually incorrect. It was
submitted that the sum of Rs.19,14,995/- and Rs.3 lakhs respectively represent
expenditure incurred on the guest house which has been added back to avoid any
possible dispute though there is no material to suggest that the expenses have
any bearing on the non-SEZ units. It was argued that merely because the above
sums have been added back by using the narration as explained pertaining to
non-SEZ units available made a basis to assume that resources of non-SEZ units
have been utilized for earning the revenue in SEZ units. So far as the
allegation of the AO that deduction u/s 10AA is not allowable as there is
splitting up/reconstruction of business already in existence and since the
expenses relating to the registered office at Vasundhara Enclave, New Delhi
and Noida DTA have been clubbed with the Noida SEZ is concerned, it was
submitted that the above observation is factually incorrect and there is no
expenditure incurred and claimed in respect of the registered office of the
company. So far as the Noida DTA is concerned, it was submitted that there is
only expenses on account of depreciation at Rs.52,74,157/- which has been
claimed in the consolidated computation of income and not as part of the
unitwise computation of income. Referring to the details furnished before him,
it was submitted that in the unitwise computation of income the depreciation
claimed for the Noida SEZ is for Rs.2,41,23,252/- which has been separately
claimed as part of the consolidated computation in addition to the
depreciation of Rs.52,74,157/- in respect of Noida unit. Thus, no expenditure
has been claimed either in respect of Noida DTA or in respect of registered
office while computing profits of Noida SEZ. Referring to  20 ITA Nos.5274 &
5275/Del/2017 various other inconsistencies and observations in the assessment
order and relying on various decisions, it was argued that the company has
correctly made the claim of deduction u/s 10AA.
26\. Based on the arguments advanced by the assessee, the ld.CIT(A) allowed
the deduction of Rs.226,98,41,758 u/s 10AA of the Act in respect of profit of
eligible business undertaking. While doing so, he noted that once separate
books of account are accepted as such, no disallowance can be validly made.
According to him, the disallowance is contrary to the principle of consistency
and deduction granted in initial year cannot be withdrawn. According to him,
mere amalgamation of the undertaking could neither in law nor on facts be made
a basis to deny legitimate claim of deduction of the assessee company and does
not amount to splitting up or reconstruction of business already in existence.
Likewise, mere acquisition of undertaking on slump sale could neither in law
nor on facts be made a basis to deny legitimate claim of deduction of the
assessee company. According to him, mere change in ownership either by way of
slump sale, merger or otherwise cannot be made a basis to disallow the claim
of deduction and also assume that there is splitting up and reconstruction of
business. According to the ld.CIT(A), fulfillment of the conditions as
provided in sub-section (1) r.w. sub- section (4) of section 10AA has to be
seen in the year of formation and since in the year of formation of the SEZ
units, units were eligible units, it cannot be said that such units are not
eligible units for deduction u/s 10AA in the instant year. According to him,
as per the provisions of section 10AA(4), eligibility of the unit  21 ITA
Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 is determined and not of the assessee. So far as the
various allegations/observations of the AO are concerned, the ld.CIT(A) held
that those are factually incorrect. Relying on various decisions, the
ld.CIT(A) deleted the disallowance of Rs.226,98,41,758/- made by the AO u/s
10AA of the Act.
27\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
us.
28\. The ld. DR strongly supported the order of the AO. He submitted that the
ld.CIT(A) has simply reproduced and relied on the submissions made by the
assessee during the appeal proceedings and has deleted the addition made by
the AO without appreciating the various facts brought on record by the AO and
without providing any proper opportunity to the AO. He submitted that the
ld.CIT(A) while holding that figure of Rs.19,14,995 and Rs.3 lakhs represent
expenses incurred on guest house and, therefore, were added back, did not
appreciate that such an explanation was never given before the AO and, on the
contrary, in the unitwise computation of income it was mentioned that these
are in the nature of inadmissible expenses of non-SEZ unit. He submitted that
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has approved the composite scheme of arrangement
for merger and demerger on 30th April, 2012 relating to A.Y. 2013-14.
Therefore, such an order will be effective from A.Y. 2013-14 and not from A.Y.
2012-13. He submitted that in the Form No.3CD of audit report u/s 44AB of the
Act for A.Y. 2013-14, the inadmissible deduction u/s 10AA of the Act has not
been specified by  22 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 the auditor. He submitted
that the AO has correctly held that the A.Y. 2013-14 was the first year in
respect of these units and as such, the claim of the assessee was required to
be examined and the specific queries raised by the AO during the assessment
proceedings were not answered by the CIT(A), who simply accepted the
submissions made by the assessee. He accordingly submitted that the order of
the CIT(A) being not in accordance with law, should be reversed and that of
the AO be restored on this issue.
29\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, heavily relied on
the order of the CIT(A). He submitted that in the grounds raised by the
Revenue, they have not challenged the deletion of addition u/s 10AA of the Act
and there is no reference to deduction under the said provision. On the
contrary, the ground raised by the Revenue is restricted to deletion of
addition on account of business income from six units. He submitted that the
income from six units has been assessed by the AO as business income which is
evident from the computation portion of the assessment order. Therefore, the
ground raised that the CIT(A) has erred in deleting the addition on account of
business income of six unit is fundamentally misconceived and misplaced. Since
the Revenue has not challenged the deletion on account of deduction u/s 10AA,
therefore, the argument of the ld.CIT, DR to extend the scope of appeal to
claim of deduction u/s 10AA is not tenable being not in accordance with the
law.
23
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
30\. Without prejudice to the above, he submitted that even independently
examining the claim, the ld. CIT, DR has not in any manner, factually and
legally rebutted the findings given by the ld.CIT(A) while allowing the claim
of deduction u/s 10AA of the Act. He submitted that the argument of the
ld.CIT, DR that the deduction u/s 10AA was claimed for the first time in A.Y.
2013-14 and, therefore, the AO was justified in denying the claim of deduction
in the instant year is not correct. He submitted that this presumption on the
part of the CIT, DR is based on hypothesis that the order of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court is dated 30th April, 2012 and, therefore, this claim became
effective in F.Y. 2012-13 relevant to A.Y. 2013-
14\. Referring to the copy of the assessment order, he submitted that the
effective date of scheme was w.e.f. 01.04.2011 which is evident from para 3,
page 3 of the assessment order. Therefore, the basis of the argument of the
ld. CIT, DR is misconceived, misplaced and intangible. He submitted that the
first year of claim of deduction was A.Y. 2012-13 and not A.Y. 2013-14.
Further, the AO, in the order passed for A.Y. 2012-13 has allowed the claim of
deduction u/s 10AA. Further, all these units were set up much prior to the
instant year where too deduction has been allowed as such and, therefore,
having regard to the settled position of law, claim has to be examined in the
year in which the unit was set up and, therefore, denial of deduction u/s 10AA
in the instant year is contrary to the provisions of law.
24
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
31\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee in the
instant case has maintained complete books of account which were duly audited
and have been accepted as such. The AO has not invoked the provisions of
section 145(3) of the Act and has not rejected the book results and the profit
declared stands accepted as such. He submitted that the taxable business
income of the undertaking has been computed independently and thereafter
taxable business income of the assessee company has been computed. Referring
to the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that
once separate books of account are accepted as such, no disallowance can be
validly made:-

deduction on reasonable basis.

ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
33\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, referring to the following decisions,
submitted that the disallowance is contrary to the principle of consistency
since the eligible undertaking of Noida and Nagpur stood amalgamated with the
assessee company during A.Y. 2012-13 and the deduction claimed thereon stood
allowed as such and, therefore, there was no justification for the AO to have
held that such undertakings were not eligible undertakings for the A.Y.
2013-14:-

> ii) CIT vs. J.K. Charitable Trust, 308 ITR 161 (SC); and

34\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that all the four
undertakings, i.e., Noida SEZ, Nagpur SEZ, Coimbatore SEZ and Uppal SEZ were
eligible undertakings wherein deduction claimed stood duly allowed and,
therefore, once the deduction was granted in the initial year, the same cannot
be withdrawn. For the above proposition, he relied on the following

assume that there is splitting up or reconstruction of business:-

41\. So far as the observation of the AO that the assessee was only having
business undertaking at Noida and it is also only after composite scheme of
arrangement and business transfer agreement during the assessment year the
assessee owned six undertakings/units is concerned, the ld. Counsel submitted
that the same has incorrectly been noted by the AO that in F.Y. 2012-13 there
was major change in the undertaking owned by the assessee company. He
submitted that the AO has factually erred in holding that the units of Noida
and Nagpur came to be owned by the assessee company in the instant year
whereas the same was acquired by the assessee during A.Y. 2012-13 and,
therefore, the period under consideration is second year of claiming exemption
u/s 10AA of the Act by the assessee.
42\. Referring to page 3, para 3 of the assessment order, he submitted that
the AO himself has admitted that the scheme of amalgamation of Ebix Software
India Pvt. Ltd. with the assessee company is w.e.f. 01.04.2011 and, therefore,
units of both Noida and Nagpur hereon owned by the amalgamating company,
namely, M/s Ebix Software India Pvt. Ltd. now stood owned by the assessee
company as an amalgamated company from A.Y. 2012-13. He submitted that the
deduction claimed by the assessee company of both the eligible units, namely,
Noida and Nagpur stood allowed as such in the immediately preceding assessment
year, i.e.,  31 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 A.Y. 2012-13 in the orders passed
u/s 143(3). Therefore, the findig that the issue of claim of deduction has to
be examined for the first time in the case of the assessee for A.Y. 2013-14 is
factually incorrect. Since deduction u/s 10AA of the Act was already examined
in the case of the assessee so far as Noida and Nagpur for the first time in
A.Y. 2012-13 and the same stands allowed as such, therefore, there is no
question of re-visiting the same during this year.
43\. The ld. Counsel submitted that the units of Coimbatore and Uppal has been
purchased on slump sale basis under business transfer agreement from M/s
Planet Online Pvt. Ltd. in the instant year and, therefore, so far as the
claim of deduction u/s 10AA vis-à-vis Coimbatore and Uppal unit, they have to
be examined for the first time in the instant year.
44\. So far as the allegation of the AO that the assessee has not shown any
domestic revenue from Noida DTA, but the resources and infrastructure of Noida
DTA has been used for earning revenue in Noida SEZ is concerned, he submitted
that there is no basis or evidence to support the above assumption made by the
AO on the basis of surmises and presumptions. He submitted that the
computation of income of the assessee company for the instant assessment year,
copy of which is placed at page 30 and 31 of the paper book, shows that
separate Profit & Loss Account of Noida SEZ was duly furnished during the
assessment proceedings. He submitted that a perusal of page 31 r.w. page
No.105 of the paper book show that the assessee had claimed deduction of
depreciation under the Companies Act for  32 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 the
Noida SEZ of Rs.2,41,23,252/- the working of which is at page 153 of the paper
book and as a result thereof the deduction claimed was of Rs.2,09,44,51,574/-
u/s 10AA of the Act. He submitted that while computing the consolidated income
of the assessee company, the assessee has not only reduced the depreciation of
SEZ unit, but, also has reduced the depreciation of non-SEZ units while
computing the income of the assessee company. He submitted that the assessee
has restricted its claim of deduction to Rs.226,98,41,758/- as against
eligible claim of Rs.227,02,14,376/-.
45\. So far as the allegation of the AO that there is variation in the profits
of SEZ undertaking whereas on the contrary, there are losses in the non-SEZ
undertakings is concerned, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that
mere fact that there are variation in the profits of SEZ undertaking and there
are losses in non-SEZ units cannot be a ground to draw any adverse inference
against claim made by the assessee company. He submitted that when the
assessee company maintains separate books of account for each of the
undertakings i.e., eligible undertakings or non-eligible undertakings owned by
the assessee company and the audit report in the prescribed form u/s 10AA had
been placed on record in the instant assessment proceedings, and no defects
were found or pointed out in respect of books of account or the P & L Account
of either the eligible undertakings or non-eligible undertakings, any adverse
observation on account of variation of profits or losses is absolutely
misconceived and thereby the claim of  33 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
deduction u/s 10AA cannot be denied. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of PCIT vs. Cincom Systems India (P) Ltd., 103
taxmann.com 161 (Delhi), the ld. Counsel submitted that the Hon'ble High Court
in the said decision has held that separate and selected accounts cannot be
rejected on the ground that profit margin of the STPI unit was higher than the
profit margin of the non-STPI unit without pointing out any discrepancy error
or mistake in the accounts.
46\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the explanation furnished
during the course of assessment proceedings in no manner whatsoever has been
rebutted and, therefore, in absence of rejection of the explanation tendered
by the assessee company in the order of assessment any adverse observation
made by the AO is fully untenable. He submitted that the observation of the AO
with respect to differential figures of inadmissible expense of non-SEZ units
in consolidated computation of income and individual computation of income is
incorrect. So far as the unitwise computation is concerned, he submitted that
the same pertains to the computation of claim of deduction u/s 10AA of the Act
in respect of unitwise and on the basis of unitwise profit & loss account,
books of account maintained by the assessee. He submitted that out of the four
eligible units, only in respect of Noida SEZ and Coimbatore SEZ, the assessee
has added back expenses of Rs.19,14,995/- and Rs.3 lakhs, respectively which
represents expenses incurred on guest house and, therefore, it had added back
to avoid possible dispute while  34 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 computing
unitwise computation for determining profit eligible for deduction u/s 10AA of
the Act. He submitted that in the consolidated computation of income, the
assessee has added back expenses of Chennai unit and Hyderabad unit of
Rs.21,85,82,287/- and Rs.3,01,30,343/-, respectively. He submitted that had
this expenditure been claimed, then, gross income of the assessee would have
been Rs.2,02,11,29,128/- and not Rs.226,98,41,758/- and consequently, the
deduction u/s 10A would have been restricted to Rs.202,11,29,128/-. Therefore,
the observation of the AO of adding back has no basis to determine the claim
of deduction u/s 10AA of the Act. In any case, he submitted that the above
figure of Rs.22,14,995/- pertains to the expenditure incurred by the eligible
units and guest house whereas the figure of Rs.24,87,12,630/- pertains to non-
eligible units and also incurred by non-eligible units which has not been
claimed while computing income of the assessee company. Therefore, the
observation of the AO with respect to differential figures of inadmissible
expenses of non-SEZ units in consolidated computation of income and individual
computation of income is incorrect.
47\. So far as the observation of the AO that resources of non-SEZ units have
been used for earning of revenue in SEZ units is concerned, he submitted that
this is also factually incorrect. So far as the observation of the AO that
expenses of Noida DTA have been clubbed with the expenses of Noida SEZ is
concerned, he submitted that the same is also incorrect since no expenditure
has been incurred  35 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 and claim in respect of the
registered office of the assessee company except depreciation of
Rs.52,74,157/-. He submitted that unsubstantiated observation does not meet
the rule of law and, therefore, cannot be relied upon to draw any adverse
inference against the assessee. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Bajaj Tempo Ltd. vs. CIT, reported in 196 ITR
188(SC), he submitted that the claim of deduction should be examined only in
the year of formulation and not subsequently.
48\. So far as the allegation of the AO that units have been acquired on slump
sale basis is concerned, he submitted that the same could not be a ground to
deny the claim of deduction in the instant year. He submitted that the above
observation of the AO is factually incorrect and legally misconceived. He
submitted that the assessee has established that it purchased undertaking on
going concern basis, namely, Coimbatore SEZ and Uppal SEZ from M/s Planet
Online Pvt. Ltd. who were eligible undertaking u/s 10AA of the Act. Once the
units are eligible undertakings there was no justification for the AO to
allege that the assessee has not been able to demonstrate how these units are
not being formed by split up or reconstruction of business already in
existence or by transfer of previously used plant & machinery. He submitted
that the AO has not brought any adverse material to rebut the above reply of
the assessee.
36
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
49\. So far as the allegation of the AO that disproportionate expenses against
the revenue show fictitious arrangement in which the entire resources of
Chennai unit or Hyderabad unit have been utilized for earning tax free income
of SEZ units is concerned, he submitted that the same is also factually
incorrect. Referring to para 13 on page 8 and 9 of the assessment order, he
submitted that it was computation of results of non-SEZ units and has noted
that during the instant year the assessee has declared losses of
Rs.3,16,90,329/- and Rs.19,58,92,585/- in respect of Chennai and Hyderabad
non-eligible undertakings of the assessee company. He has noted that there are
no revenue declared of the Chennai unit and likewise there is only revenue of
Rs.2,27,74,588/- in respect of Hyderabad unit and, accordingly alleged that
disproportionate expenses against revenue show fictitious arrangement in which
the entire resources of Chennai unit or Hyderabad units have been utilized for
earning tax free income of SEZ units. The ld. Counsel, drew the attention of
the Bench to the following table and submitted that the assessee has not even
claimed the losses of Hyderabad and Chennai units while computing the income
of the assessee:-

50\. Therefore, the observation of the AO has no valid justification and in
any case cannot be a ground to deny claim of deduction u/s 10AA. Relying on
the following decisions, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that mere
suspicion, surmises and conjectures cannot be a ground to hold to the
contrary:-
            a)     37     ITR 271        (SC) Uma Charan Shaw & Bros. Co. v. CIT
            b)     37     ITR 151        (SC) Omar Salay Mohammad Sait v. CIT
            c)     26     ITR 736        (SC) Dhirajlal Girdharilal v, CIT
            d)     26     ITR 775        (SC) Dhakeshwari Cottom Mills Ltd. v. CIT

            f)     91 ITR 8 (SC) CIT v Calcutta Discount Company Ltd.
                                                   38
                                                                     ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
51\. The ld. Counsel accordingly submitted that the order of the CIT(A) being
in accordance with the law should be upheld and the ground raised by the
Revenue should be dismissed.
52\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. We
find, the AO, in the instant case, disallowed the claim of deduction of
Rs.226,98,41,758/- on account of business income from six units which was
claimed by the assessee as exempt u/s 10AA of the Act. Although the Revenue
has challenged the order of the CIT(A) in deleting the same, a perusal of the
same shows that the Revenue has not made any reference to the deduction u/s
10AA of the Act. Be that as it may, the reason for denial of deduction u/s
10AA of the Act by the AO may be summarized as under:-
> i) That it is the first year of claim of deduction in respect of Noida SEZ
> and Nagpur SEZ;
> ii) The assessee was only having business undertaking at Noida and it is
> also only after composite scheme of arrangement and business transfer
> agreement during the assessment year, the assessee company owns six
> undertakings/units;
39
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> iii) The assessee has not shown any domestic revenue from Noida DTA and the
> resources and infrastructure of Noida DTA has been used for earning revenue
> in Noida SEZ;
> iv) There is variation in the profits of SEZ undertakings.
> v) There are differential figures of inadmissible expenses of non-SEZ units
> in consolidated computation of income and individual computation of income;
> vi) Resources of non-SEZ units have been used for earning of revenue in SEZ
> units;
> vii) Expenses of Noida DTA have been clubbed up with the expenses of Noida
> SEZ;
> viii) Units have been acquired on slum sale basis;
> ix) Disproportionate expenses against revenue show fictitious arrangement in
> which the entire resources of Chennai unit or Hyderabad unit have been
> utilized for earning tax free income of SEZ units;
> x) The ratio of employee expenses to revenue under each of the unit show
> that the deduction claimed by the assessee company in respect of eligible
> units is not in accordance with the law.
53\. We find, the ld.CIT(A) allowed the claim of the assessee on the ground
that the various observations so made by the AO are factually incorrect or not
in accordance with the law. While holding so, he further held that once
separate  40 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 books of account are accepted as
such, no disallowance can be validly made. Further, deduction granted in the
initial year cannot be withdrawn and the disallowance is contrary to the
principles of consistency. According to the ld.CIT(A), mere amalgamation of
the undertaking could neither in law and nor on fact be made a basis to deny
legitimate claim of deduction of the assessee company and does not amount to
splitting up or reconstruction of business already in existence. Likewise,
mere acquisition of undertaking on slump sale could neither in law and nor on
fact be made a basis to deny legitimate claim of deduction of the assessee
company. He further held that mere change in ownership either by way of slump
sale, merger or otherwise cannot be made a basis to disallow the claim of
deduction and also assume that there is splitting up or reconstruction of
business. He further held that fulfillment of the conditions as provided in
sub-section (1) read with sub-section (4) of section 10AA has to be seen in
the year of formation and since in the year of formation of the SEZ units,
which were eligible units, it cannot be said that such units are not eligible
units for deduction u/s 10AA in the subsequent year. According to him, the
reading of the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 10AA that eligibility
of the unit is determined and not of the assessee.
54\. We do not find any infirmity in the order of the CIT(A) in deleting the
disallowance made by the AO u/s 10AA of the Act. From the various details
furnished by the assessee in the paper book as well as in the written
synopsis, it is  41 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 an undisputed fact that the
assessee has six undertakings out of which four undertakings have been claimed
to be eligible u/s 10AA of the Act. The amount of deduction claimed in respect
of four undertakings u/s 10AA are as under:-
              Sr.              Name of undertaking                      Amount
              1                Noida SEZ                                209,44,51,574
              2                Nagpur SEZ                               4,88,88,288
              3                Coimbatore SEZ                           4,42,95,190
              4                Hyderabad SEZ                            8,25,79,324

55\. From the various details furnished by the assessee, we find the
historical position in respect of the deduction in respect of the aforesaid
four undertakings are as under:-

56\. From the above, we find that in each of the undertakings, deduction as
claimed by the assessee has been allowed by the Revenue both in the preceding
year and succeeding assessment years. Neither the AO nor the CIT, DR, has at
all in any manner rebutted the aforesaid factual position and, therefore,
following the rule of consistency itself, we are of the view that the claim of
the assessee is maintainable and cannot be denied.
57\. We find, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. M/s Excel
Industries, 358 ITR 295 has observed as under:-
> "29. In Radhasoami Satsang Saomi Bagh v. Commissioner of Income Tax, [1992]
> 193 ITR 321 (SC) this Court did not think it appropriate to allow the
> reconsideration of an issue for a subsequent assessment year if the same
> "fundamental aspect" permeates in different assessment years. In arriving at
> this conclusion, this Court referred to an interesting passage from Hoystead
> v. Commissioner of Taxation, 1926 AC 155 (PC) wherein it was said: "Parties
> are not permitted to begin fresh litigation because of new views they may
> entertain of the law of the case, or new versions which they present as to
> what should be a proper apprehension by the court of the legal result either
> of the construction of the documents or the weight of certain circumstances.
> If this were permitted, litigation would have no end, except when legal
> ingenuity is exhausted. It is a principle of law that this cannot be
> permitted and there is abundant authority reiterating that principle.
> Thirdly, the same principle, namely, that of setting to rest rights of
> litigants, applies to the case where a point, fundamental to the decision,
> taken or assumed by the plaintiff and traversable by the defendant, has not
> been traversed. In that case also a defendant is bound by the judgment,
> although it may be true enough that  43 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> subsequent light or ingenuity might suggest some traverse which had not been
> taken."
> 30\. Reference was also made to Parashuram Pottery Works Ltd. v. Income Tax
> Officer, [1977] 106 ITR 1 (SC) and then it was held: "We are aware of the
> fact that strictly speaking res judicata does not apply to income-tax
> proceedings. Again, each assessment year being a unit, what is decided in
> one year may not apply in the following year but where a fundamental aspect
> permeating through the different assessment years has been found as a fact
> one way or the other and parties have allowed that position to be sustained
> by not challenging the order, it would not be at all appropriate to allow
> the position to be changed in a subsequent year. "On these reasonings in the
> absence of any material change justifying the Revenue to take a different
> view of the matter - and if there was no change it was in support of the
> assessee -we do not think the question should have been reopened and
> contrary to what had been decided by the Commissioner of Income Tax in the
> earlier proceedings, a different and contradictory stand should have been
> taken."
> 31\. It appears from the record that in several assessment years, the
> Revenue accepted the order of the Tribunal in favour of the assessee and did
> not pursue the matter any further but in respect of some assessment years
> the matter was taken up in appeal before the Bombay High Court but without
> any success. That being so, the Revenue cannot be allowed to flip-flop on
> the issue and it ought let the matter rest rather than spend the tax payers'
> money in pursuing litigation for the sake of it."
58\. We further find that Noida SEZ unit was set up in assessment year 2010-11
and, therefore, in the instant year, this is fourth year of deduction.
Similarly, Nagpur SEZ was set up in A.Y. 2011-12 and this is third year of
deduction. We find, the Coimbatore SEZ was set up in A.Y. 2011-12 and is the
third year of deduction. Finally, Uppal SEZ was set up in A.Y. 2012-13 and is
the second year of deduction. It is the settled proposition of law that
eligibility of claim of deduction u/s 10AA has to be examined in the year of
setting up of the unit and once the deduction has been allowed in the year of
formation of the unit, then, the  44 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 AO is not
entitled to re-examine the eligibility of claim of deduction in the succeeding
year.
59\. We find, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. Delhi Press
Samachar Patra (P) Ltd, 355 ITR 14 has observed as under:
> "74. In the present case, the claim of the assessee under section 80-I of
> the Act was examined and allowed by the Assessing officer for three years
> preceding the assessment year 1991-1992. It is relevant to note that
> assessments in the earlier years i.e relating to assessment years 1988-89,
> 1989-1990 and 1990- 1991 has not been disturbed by the Assessing Officer and
> there has been no change that could justify the Assessing officer adopting a
> different view in the assessment years 1991-92 and thereafter. As stated
> hereinbefore, in certain cases where the issues involved have attained
> finality on account of the subject matter of dispute having been finally
> adjudicated, the question of reopening and revisiting the same issue again
> in subsequent years would not arise. This is based on the principle that
> there should be finality in all legal proceedings. The Supreme Court in the
> case of Parashuram Pottery Works Co. Ltd. v. ITO: [1977] 106 ITR 1 had held
> as under:-
> "that the policy of law is that there must be a point of finality in all
> legal proceedings, that stale issues should not be reactivated beyond a
> particular stage and that lapse of time must induce repose in and set at
> rest judicial and quasi-judicial controversies as it must in other spheres
> of human activity."
> 75\. In the facts of the present case, where although the Assessing officer
> has allowed the assessee deduction under section 80-I of the Act in the
> preceding years, one may still have certain reservations as to whether the
> issue of eligibility of Unit nos. 2 and 3 fulfilling the conditions has been
> finally settled, since the question has not been a subject matter of any
> appellate proceedings in the years preceding the assessment year 1991-92.
> However, there is yet another aspect which needs to be considered. By virtue
> of section 80-I(5) of the Act, deduction under section 80-I of the Act is
> available to an assessee in respect of the assessment year (referred to as
> the initial assessment year) relevant to the previous year in which the
> industrial undertaking begins to manufacture or produce articles or things,
> or to operate its cold storage plant or plants or the ship is first brought
> into use or the business of the hotel starts functioning or the company
> commences work by way of repairs to ocean- going vessels or other powered
> craft. Such deduction is also available for the seven assessment years
> immediately succeeding the initial assessment year. Surely in cases where an
> assessee is held to be eligible for deduction in the initial assessment
> year, the same cannot be denied in the subsequent  45 ITA Nos.5274 &

60\. Similarly, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Western
Outdoor Interactive (P) Ltd., 349 ITR 309 (Bom) has observed as under:-
> "5. On the other hand, Mr. Percy Pardiwalla, Senior Counsel appearing on
> behalf of the respondent-assessee submitted that in view of the decision of
> this court in the matter of Commissioner of Income Tax v. Paul Brothers
> reported in 216 ITR 548 and M/s.Direct Information Private Ltd. v. ITO dated
> 29/9/2011 in Writ Petition No.1479/2011 (Reported in 2011 (12) LJSOFT
> 320), the issue is no longer open to debate. In the above case, it is held
> that once a benefit of deduction was extended in respect of a provision for

> first year it cannot be withdrawn for subsequent years, particularly, when

> 2000-01 and 2001-02 in respect of its claim for exemption under Section-10A
> of the Act and the same not having been withdrawn for those years it cannot

> 6\. We have considered the submissions. We find that the submissions made by

> unit is not formed by splitting up of the first unit."
61\. So far as the question as to whether amalgamation of the Noida SEZ and
Nagpur SEZ with the assessee company can be a ground to suggest that the same
amounts to splitting up or reconstruction of business already in existence is
concerned, we find the provisions of section 10AA(5) read as under:-  47
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 "(5) Where any undertaking being the Unit which
> is entitled to the deduction under this section is transferred, before the
> expiry of the period specified in this section, to another undertaking,
> being the Unit in a scheme of amalgamation or demerger,--
> (a) no deduction shall be admissible under this section to the amalgamating
> or the demerged Unit, being the company for the previous year in which the
> amalgamation or the demerger takes place; and
> (b) the provisions of this section shall, as they would have applied to the
> amalgamating or the demerged Unit being the company as if the amalgamation
> or demerger had not taken place.
> 62\. A perusal of the above provision show that this is an enabling
> provision to enable an assessee to claim deduction despite transfer of the
> eligible unit in a scheme of amalgamation of demerger. We find, identical
> issue had come up before the Kolkata Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
> ITO vs. M/s Last Peak Data Pvt. Ltd. (supra) where the Tribunal has observed
> as under:
> "29. The third & fourth reason given by the AO was that the Assessee does
> not fulfil the following conditions laid down in Sec.10AA(4)(ii) & (iii) of
> the Act which reads thus:
> (ii) it is not formed by the splitting up, or the reconstruction, of a
> business already in existence:
> (iii) it is not formed by the transfer to a new business, of machinery or
> plant previously used for any purpose.
> 30\. The AO referred to the amalgamation of M/S. Last Peak BPO Pvt. Ltd.,
> with the Assessee during the previous year. M/S. Last Peak BPO Pvt. Ltd.,
> was in all respects an STP unit and was similarly placed as that of the
> Assessee in terms of approval and being eligible for deduction u/s.10A of

> license dated 17.6.2005 from the Asst. Commissioner of Customs 100% EOU/STP

> 31\. The CIT(A) did not decide on this issue at all. We have considered the

> 63\. Similarly the Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in the case of M/s
> Samsung India Software Operations (P) Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT (supra) has
> observed as under:-
> "5. The facts of the case in brief are that the assessee filed return of

.............................................................................................
.............................................................................................
14\. We have considered the submissions of both the parties and carefully gone
through the material available on record. It is noticed that a similar issue
having identical facts has been decided by the ITAT Bench 'B' Bangalore in ITA
No.623 & 847/Bang/2010 for the assessment years 2004- 05 & 2005-06
respectively in the case of DCIT v. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd., order dated
19.05.2010 wherein vide para 10 it has been held as under:- "10. We considered
the rival contentions and the facts of the case reflected in the orders passed
by the lower authorities. As rightly pointed out by the CIT(A), the assessee's
undertaking existed in the same place, form and substance and did carry on the
same business before and after the change in the legal character of the form
of organization. Formerly, it was a branch establishment of non-resident
company/foreign company but later on, it was converted into a subsidiary
company. But for the above change of the organizational status, the same unit
continued to function throughout the time. Therefore, it is quite fruitless to
argue that the organizational change has caused conversion of the existing
unit to a new unit. There is no such splitting up or reconstruction of an
existing business in the case of a branch establishment becoming a subsidiary
establishment. The assessee's unit satisfied all the conditions stipulated in
the Act and was entitled for the benefit. Therefore, as rightly held by the
CIT(A), a mere organizational change is not a ground to hold that the assessee
has violated the conditions stated in 10A(2)(ii). It is a case of only change
in the name and style. It is clearly possible to state that there was no
violation of the conditions laid down in sec. 10A(2)(iii) as well."
15\. In the present case also, the assessee undertaking existed in the same
place, form and substance and did carry on the same business before and after
the change in the legal character of the form of the organization. Formerly it
was a branch establishment of a nonresident company/foreign company, but later
on it was converted into a subsidiary company. However, for the above change
of organization status, same unit continued to function throughout the time
and even Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) authority vide letter dated
05.12.2005 gave the approval for transfer of STP activities of M/s. SECL to
the assessee w.e.f. 01.12.2005. Therefore a mere organizational change was not
a ground for the AO to hold that the assessee was not entitled for deduction
u/s. 10A of the Act within the meaning of section 10A(2) of the Act.  50
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Thus, in view of the above and respectfully
following the aforesaid referred to earlier order of the coordinate Bench, we
set aside the impugned order passed by the ld. CIT(A) and direct the AO to
allow the claim of the assessee for deduction u/s. 10A of the Act.
16\. For the aforesaid view, we are also fortified by the decision of this
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of ITO v. M/s. GXS Technology Centre (Pvt.)
Ltd. in ITA No.616/Bang/2009 for the A.Y. 2004-05, order dated 10.08.2010
reported in wherein the relevant finding is given in para 4 & 5 which read as
under:-
"4. The learned departmental representative strongly supported the order of
the AO while the learned counsel for assessee supported the order of the
CIT(A) and also placed reliance upon the decision of the 'B' Bench of this
Tribunal in the case of Dy.CIT v. M/s. L.G. Soft India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA
Nos.623 & 847/Bang/2010 dated 19-5-2010 wherein it has been held that where an
undertaking existed in the same place, form and substance and did carry on the
same business before and after the change in the legal character of the form
of organization, the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s. 10A of the Act.
He also placed reliance upon the decision of the Calcutta High Court in the
case of CIT vs. P.K. Engg. & Forging (P) Ltd., reported in 87 Taxman 101
wherein, while considering the assessee's claim for deduction u/s. 80J, it was
held that where the industrial undertaking run by a firm which had been
allowed deduction u/s 80-J for a period of 5 years, it would be entitled to
benefit of residuary period. He also placed reliance upon the decision of the
Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Tech Books Electronics Services (P)
Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT wherein it was held that merely because of change in
ownership the exemption cannot be denied. Another decision relied upon by him
is in the case of Kumaran Systems (P) Ltd. vs. ACIT wherein it was held that
where a firm is converted into a company and there was change only in the
composition of ownership and not the undertaking and business, the exemption
allowed to the firm u/s 10A of the Act could not be denied to the company
merely because it had been separately granted recognition.
5\. Having heard both the sides and having considered the rival submissions,
we find that the issue is squarely covered by the decisions relied upon by the
learned counsel for assessee. The distinctions sought to be brought out by the
learned Departmental Representative, in our opinion, are not relevant to the
facts of the case before us. In view of the same, the appeal of the revenue is
dismissed."
17\. In view of the above, this issue is decided in favour of the assessee."
51
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
64\. Even independently examining the issue, it will be seen that the
fulfillment of the conditions as provided in sub-section (1) r.w. sub-section
(4) of section 10AA has to be seen in the year of formation and since in the
year of formation of the SEZ units, six units were eligible units, it cannot
be said that such units are not eligible units for deduction u/s 10AA in the
instant year. A plain reading of the provisions as contained in sub-section
(1) of section 10AA of the Act would show that it provides for deduction of
profits and gains derived from the export of article or things or from
services of a unit located in a Special Economic Zone on satisfaction of the
following conditions:-
> a) the assessee should be an "entrepreneur" as per section 2(j) of Special
> Economic Zones Act, 2005, i.e., such persons should have been granted a
> letter of approval by the Development Commissioner u/s 15(9) of Special
> Economic Zone Act, 2005;
> b) the "unit" should be a unit as defined in clause (zc) of section 2 of
> Special Economic Zone Act, 2005;
> c) The "unit" should begin to manufacture or produce articles or things or
> provide any service during the F.Y. relevant to A.Y. commencing on or after
> 01.04.2006; and
> d) The "unit" should export things or service by any mode, physical or
> otherwise.
> However, the aforesaid deduction is subject to condition provided in sub-
section (4) of section 10AA.
52
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
65\. In view of the above, it is evident that any eligible unit seeking to
claim deduction u/s 10AA(1) of the Act should necessarily fulfill the
conditions as specified in sub-section (4) of section 10AA which reads as
under:-
> "(4) This section applies to any undertaking, being the Unit, which fulfils
> all the following conditions, namely:--
> (i) it has begun or begins to manufacture or produce articles or things or
> provide services during the previous year relevant to the assessment year
> commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 2006 in any Special Economic
> Zone;
> (ii) it is not formed by the splitting up, or the reconstruction, of a
> business already in existence:
> Provided that this condition shall not apply in respect of any undertaking,
> being the Unit, which is formed as a result of the re-establishment,
> reconstruction or revival by the assessee of the business of any such
> undertaking as is referred to in section 33B, in the circumstances and
> within the period specified in that section;
> (iii) it is not formed by the transfer to a new business, of machinery or
> plant previously used for any purpose.
> Explanation.--The provisions of Explanations 1 and 2 to sub-section (3) of
> section 80-IA shall apply for the purposes of clause (iii) of this sub-
> section as they apply for the purposes of clause (ii) of that sub-section.
66\. We find, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bajaj Tempo Ltd. vs.
CIT (supra) has observed as under:-
> "The restriction or denial of benefit arises not by transfer of building or
> material to the new company but that it should not be farmed by such
> transfer. This is the key to interpretation. The formation should not be by
> such transfer, The emphasis is on formation not on use. 'Therefore it is not
> transfer of building or material but the one which can be held to have
> resulted in formation of the undertaking. In Textile Machinery Corporation
> Ltd. v. CIT this Court while interpreting section 15-C observed:
> "The true test is not whether the new industrial undertaking connotes
> expansion of the existing business of the assessee but whether it is all the
> same a new and identifiable undertaking separate and distinct from the
> existing business. No particular decision in one case can lay down an
> inexorable test to determine whether a given case comes under section 15-C
> or not. In order  53 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 that the new undertaking
> can be said to be not formed out of the already existing business, there
> must be a new emergence of a physically separate industrial unit which may
> exist onits own as a viable unit. An undertaking is formed out of the
> existing business if the physical identity with the old unit is preserved."
> Even though this decision was concerned with clause dealing with
> reconstruction of an existing business, the expression "not formed" was
> construed to mean that the undertaking should not be a continuation of the
> old but emergence of a new unit. Therefore, even if the undertaking is
> established by transfer of building, plant or machinery, but it is not
> formed as a result of such transfer, the assessee could not be denied the
> benefit.
67\. Similarly, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of CIT v. Yokogawa India
Ltd. (supra) has observed as under:-
> "17. If the specific provisions of the Act provide [first proviso to
> Sections 10A(1); 10A (IA) and 10A (4)] that the unit that is contemplated
> for grant of benefit of deduction is the eligible undertaking and that is
> also how the contemporaneous Circular of the department (No.794 dated
> 09.08.2000) understood the situation, it is only logical and natural that
> the stage of deduction of the profits and gains of the business of an
> eligible undertaking has to be made independently and, therefore,
> immediately after the stage of determination of its profits and gains. At
> that stage the aggregate of the incomes under other heads and the provisions
> for set off and carry forward contained in Sections 70, 72 and 74 of the Act
> would be premature for application. The deductions under Section 10A
> therefore would be prior to the commencement of the exercise to be
> undertaken under Chapter VI of the Act for arriving at the total income of
> the assessee from the gross total income. The somewhat discordant use of the
> expression "total income of the assessee" in Section 10A has already been
> dealt with earlier and in the overall scenario unfolded by the provisions of
> Section 10A the aforesaid discord can be reconciled by understanding the
> expression "total income of the assessee' in Section 10A as 'total income of
> the undertaking'.
68\. We find, the CBDT in respect of similar relief u/s 84 of the Act has
taken the view that the relief would be available for successors in F.
No.15/5/63-IT(A-I), dated 13th December, 1963. Following the above
instruction, the courts have allowed the deduction u/s 80J in the following
cases:-
54
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
69\. In view of the above and in view of the detailed reasoning given by the
ld.CIT(A), we do not find any infirmity in his order allowing the claim of
deduction u/s 10AA.
70\. So far as the argument of the ld. CIT, DR that the order of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in approving the composite scheme of arrangement for merger
and demerger is dated 30th April, 2012 and, therefore, it is applicable for
A.Y. 2013-14 (onwards and not for A.Y. 2012-13 is concerned) which the
ld.CIT(A) has not answered is concerned, the same, in our opinion, is devoid
of any merit and contrary to settled position of law and even facts on record.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Marshal Sons & Co.(India) Ltd. vs.
ITO, 223 ITR 809, has held that the effective date for amalgamation would be
date of investment under the scheme. The relevant observation of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court from para 14 onwards read as under:-
> "Every scheme of amalgamation has to necessarily provide a date with effect
> from which the amalgamation/transfer shall take place. The scheme concerned
> herein does so provide viz., January 1, 1982. It is true that while
> sanctioning the scheme, it is open to the Court to modify the said date and
> prescribe such date of amalgamation/transfer as it thinks appropriate in the
> facts and circumstances of the case. If the Court so specifies a date, there
> is little doubt that such date would be the date of amalgamation/date of
> transfer. But where the Court does not prescribe any specific date but
> merely sanctions the scheme presented to it - as has happened in this case -
> it should follow that the date of amalgamation/date of transfer is the date
> specified in the scheme as "the transfer date". It cannot be otherwise. It
> must be remembered that before applying to the Court under Section 391(1), a
> scheme has to be framed and such scheme has to contain a date of
> amalgamation/transfer. The proceedings before the court may take some time;
> indeed, they are bound to take some time because several steps provided by

> complied with. During the period the  55 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> proceedings are pending before the Court, both the amalgamating units, i.e.,
> the Transferor Company and the Transferee Company may carry on business, as
> has happened in this case but normally provision is made for this aspect

> does expressly provide that with affect from the transfer date, the
> Transferor Company (Subsidiary Company) shall be deemed to have carried on
> the business for and on behalf of the Transferee Company (Holding Company)
> with all attendant consequences. It is equally relevant to notice that the
> Courts have not only sanctioned the scheme in this case but have also not
> specified any other date as the date of transfer amalgamation. In such a

Counsel for the Revenue contended that if the aforesaid view is adopted when
several complications will ensue in case the Court refuses to sanction the
scheme of amalgamation. We do not see any basis for this apprehension.
Firstly, an assessment can always be made and is supposed to be made on the
Transferee Company taking into account the income of both the Transferor and
Transferee Company. Secondly, and probably the more advisable course from the
point of view of the Revenue would be to make one assessment on the Transferee
Company taking into account the income of both of Transferor or Transferee
Companies and also to make separate protective assessments on both the
Transferor and Transferee Companies separately. There may be a certain
practical difficulty in adopting this course inasmuch as separate balance-
sheets may not be available for the Transferor and Transferee Companies. But
that may not be an insuperable problem inasmuch as assessment can always be
made, on the available material, even without a balance- sheet. In certain
cases, best-judgment assessment may also be resorted to. Be that as it may, we
need not purpose this line of enquiry because it does not arise for
consideration in these cases directly."  56
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
71\. Similarly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Saraswati Industrial
Syndicate, 186 ITR 278, has observed as under:-
> "......The High Court was in error in holding that even after amalgamation
> of two companies, the transferor company did not become non-existent instead
> it continued its entity in a blended form with the appellant company. The
> High Court's view that on amalgamation 'there is no complete destruction of
> corpo- rate personality of the transferor company instead there is a
> blending of the corporate personality of one with another corporate body and

72\. Thus, since, admittedly and undisputably, the effective date of the
scheme was 01.04.2011 under the scheme of amalgamation of Noida SEZ unit and
Nagpur SEZ units which amalgamated with the assessee company in A.Y. 2012-13
against which the claim of deduction u/s 10AA was allowed by the AO in the
order passed u/s 143(3) for A.Y. 2012-13, therefore, we are of the opinion
that the issue cannot be examined in the instant year. In any case, we have
otherwise held that the eligibility of units has to be seen in the year of
formation of unit and once eligibility in the year of formation has not been
denied or disputed, the claim is valid claim particularly when such claim has
also been allowed in preceding/succeeding years.
73\. So far as the argument relating to quantum of deduction on the ground
that there is variation in the ratio of employee expenses to revenue under
each of the unit is concerned, we are of the considered opinion that once the
AO has accepted  57 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 separate audited books of
account maintained by the assessee company for each of the unit which are also
supported by audit report, the quantum of deduction can never be separately
disputed. We find the assessee itself has computed the business income for
each of the unit independently the details of which are already given in the
preceding para. Once separate books of accounts maintained have been accepted,
the quantum of the claim cannot be tinkered on surmises and conjectures by
alleging in a vague manner that expenditure or revenue has been diverted to
another unit.
74\. We find, the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of Quest
Informatics (P) Ltd. (supra) has observed as under:-
> "3. The assessee is an Indian company engaged in the business of computer
> software development and business processing out source. During the
> financial year 2005-06, the assessee was running its business from a non-
> STPI unit under a rented premises. In this period the party has applied for
> permission to set up the STPI unit at the ground floor of the said premises.
> The STPI authorities granted approval for setting up of the STPI unit for
> development of computer service/IT enabled services (TIES) on February 31,
> 2006\. The assessee started the business in the newly set up unit during the
> financial year 2006-07. The assessee also continued to carry out its
> business from the non-STPI unit also. Separate books of account were
> maintained by the assessee for the STPI unit and the non-STPI unit. In
> respect of the STPI unit the claim for deduction under section 10A made by
> the assessee was rejected on the ground that the STPI unit is found by
> splitting of the existing unit. In appeal, on appreciation of the material
> on record, the said order was set aside and the benefit under section 10A
> was extended to the STPI unit and the Revenue preferred an appeal before the
> Tribunal which has confirmed the same.
> 4\. This court had an occasion to consider the similar question in the case
> of CIT v. Wipro GE Medical System Ltd. reported in [2015] 4 ITR-OL 288
> (Karn) : [2014] 226 Taxman 156 (Karn), and in the case of CIT v. Maxim India
> Integrated Circuit Design (P.) Ltd. reported in [2011] 202 Taxman 365 (Karn)
> and CIT Vs. Expert Outsource (P) Ltd., [2013] 358 ITR 518 [2012] 20
> taxmann.com 481 (Kar.).
58
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> 5\. The law laid down in the aforesaid cases squarely applies to the facts
> of this case. Therefore, the findings recorded by both the appellate
> authorities are in accordance with law. Thus, the substantial question of
> law raised in these appeals is answered in favour of the assessee and
> against the Revenue and the appeals are dismissed.
75\. Similarly, the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Addl. CIT vs.
Delhi Press Samachar Patra (P) Ltd., 103 TTJ 578, has held as under:-
> "5. We have heard the arguments of both the sides and also perused the
> relevant material on record. As has been pointed out on behalf of the
> assessee- company before the authorities below as well as before us, unit 1
> was its publishing house whereas units 3 and 4 were its printing houses. The
> nature of business of unit 1 and unit 4 of the assessee, thus, was entirely
> different and there was no justifiable reason to compare the profit margin
> of the said units. Moreover, separate books of account were maintained by
> the assessee- company in respect of unit 4 and no material or specific
> defects were pointed out by the AO in the said books, which were duly
> produced before him for verification during the course of assessment
> proceedings. As noted in the order of the AO as well as in the order of the
> learned CIT(A), the printing work was being done by unit 4 of the assessee-
> company for unit 1 at fixed rates and the claim of the assessee that the
> said rates were even lower than the market rates was not rebutted/refuted by
> the AO by bringing any material on record. As rightly contended by the
> learned Counsel for the assessee before us, the expenditure on marketing and
> distribution of the publications was entirely required to be done for the
> business of publishing house i.e. unit No. 1 and the same was not connected
> with the printing business of unit 4, It appears that all these material and
> relevant aspects, however, (were) simply brushed aside by the AO and he
> proceeded to reject the book results of unit 4 shown by the assessee merely
> on the basis that the profit margin shown by the assessee in respect of the
> said unit was higher at 62 per cent as against profit margin of 10 per cent
> shown in respect of other units of the assessee. In our opinion, this action
> of the AO was not sustainable in law in the facts and circumstances of the
> present case including especially the fact that no material or specific
> defects were pointed out by him in the books of account maintained by the
> assessee in respect of unit 4 and there was nothing brought on record by him
> to show that the profit margin of 62 per cent shown in the said books was
> actually lower. On the other hand, such higher profit margin in respect of
> unit 4 was satisfactorily explained by the assessee-company and having
> satisfied with such explanation, the AO was directed by the learned CIT(A)
> to allow the deduction claimed by the assessee under Section 80-IA of the
> Act on the book results of unit 4. As such, considering all the facts and
> circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the relief allowed by the
> learned CIT(A) on this issue to the assessee was fully justified and there
> being no infirmity in the  59 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 impugned orders
> of the learned CIT(A) allowing such relief, we uphold the same."
76\. We find, the assessee, in its reply dated 21.11.2016 addressed to the AO
has stated as under:-
60
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
77\. Similarly the assessee in its reply dated 21st November, 2016 has stated
as under:-
61
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 62 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 63 ITA Nos.5274
> & 5275/Del/2017 64 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
77\. The above submissions before the AO by the assessee has neither been
challenged nor rebutted before us and, therefore, we are of the considered
opinion that the observations of the AO cannot be made a basis to restrict the
claim of deduction under section 10AA of the Act. So far as the contention of
the ld. DR that the CIT(A) has erred in para 3.20 of his order to state that
the figures of Rs.19,14,995/- and Rs.3 lakhs represents expenses incurred on
guest house and, therefore, were added back has never come before AO, and, on
the contrary, in the unit-wise computation of income it is mentioned that
these are in the nature of inadmissible expenses of non-SEZ unit is concerned,
we find the assessee has furnished unit-wise computation of deduction under
section 10AA out of the four eligible units, only in respect of Noida SEZ and
Coimbatore SEZ, the assessee has added back expenses of Rs.19,14,995/- and
Rs.3 lakhs respectively. The above figure represents expenses which were added
back while computing the unit-wise computation for determining the profit
eligible for deduction under section 10AA of the Act. Therefore, once the
expenditure has been added back which claim has also been accepted by the AO
in the order of assessment, then, this, in our opinion,  65 ITA Nos.5274 &
5275/Del/2017 becomes a non-issue. In our opinion, the allegation of the AO
that the entire expenses have not been added back and it is a clear admission
on the part of the assessee that resources of non-SEZ units have been used for
earning of revenue in SEZ units is concerned, this also, in our opinion, is a
vague finding without any basis. Mere add back of certain expenses from
eligible profits of eligible unit which is accepted in the order of assessment
cannot be a basis to assume that the resources of non-SEZ units have been used
for earning the revenue in SEZ units. So far as the allegation of the ld. CIT,
DR that the assessee has failed to submit specific details to specific queries
during the course of assessment proceedings is concerned, we find from the
paper book that the assessee has in fact filed detailed reply before the AO to
the queries raised point-wise. Therefore, this allegation of the ld. CIT, DR
in our opinion is without any basis.
78\. We further find that during the instant year the assessee has declared
losses of Rs.3,16,90,321/- and Rs.19,58,92,585/- in respect of Chennai and
Hyderabad non-eligible undertaking of the assessee company. Further, there are
no revenue declared by the Chennai unit and, likewise only revenue of
Rs.2,27,74,588/-for Hyderabad unit has been declared. The assessee has not
claimed the loss of Hyderabad and Chennai unit while computing the income. In
our opinion, once separate books of account have been maintained for each of
the undertakings, there is no basis for the AO to allege that any of the
expenses of non-SEZ units pertained to revenue of eligible units. Once such
expenses has also not been claimed, the  66 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 same
is of no consequences. At best the AO could have reduced the net expenditure
claimed from the deduction under section 10AA of the Act and nothing more but
the same could not be a reason for the AO to deny the claim of deduction under
section 10AA. Therefore, to suggest that there is fictitious arrangement and
the entire resources of Chennai unit or Hyderabad unit have been utilised for
earning tax free income of SEZ unit is not justified. Suspicion, surmises and
conjectures however strong may be cannot be a basis for disallowing a claim of
detection. In view of the above discussion, we do not find any infirmity in
the order of the CIT(A) in deleting the disallowance of deduction claimed
under section 10AA. Accordingly the ground raised by the revenue is dismissed.
79\. Ground of appeal No. 2 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> "2. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs. 82,88,099/- made by the AO on
> account of other income from 4 SEZ units."
80\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the AO during the course of
assessment proceedings observed from the reply dated 20th December 2016 as per
annexure-A that the assessee has included 'other income' of Rs.82,88,099/- in
the computation of profit of four SEZ undertakings which are as under:-
    NOIDA SEZ         Nagpur SEZ       Total
    80,90,791         1,97,308         82,88,099
81\. He observed from Note No.23 of the P&L account that the 'other income'
includes interest on bank deposit and 'other income.' According to the AO this
67 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 income of Rs.82,88,099/- cannot be considered
as profits and gains derived from export of article/things from services as
necessitated in section 10AA. He, therefore, excluded this income from the
profits of undertakings for computation of eligible profits of the eligible
undertakings and made addition of the same to the total income of the
assessee.
82\. Before the CIT(A) it was submitted that identical deduction under section
10AA of the Act was claimed on the interest of Rs.1,40,67,685/- in the
assessment year 2012-13 and the same was allowed by the AO in the assessment
order framed under section 143(3) of the Act. Therefore, following the rule of
consistency itself, no disallowance is called for. The decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs Excel industries Ltd., 358 ITR 295 was
brought to the notice of the CIT(A). Various decisions were also brought to
the notice of the CIT(A) to the proposition that the assessee is entitled to
deduction under section 10AA of the Act to the extent of Rs. 82,88,099/-.
83\. Based on the arguments advanced by the assessee, the ld.CIT(A) deleted
the addition of Rs.82,88,099/- made by the AO.
84\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
the Tribunal.
85\. The Ld. DR strongly supported the order of the AO and submitted that
since the interest income is not derived from the export of article or things
or from  68 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 services as necessitated under
section 10AA of the Act, therefore, the CIT(A) was not justified in
considering the same as business income eligible for deduction under section
10AA of the Act.
86\. The ld. Counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, strongly supported
the order of the CIT(A). He submitted that identical deduction under section
10AA of the Act was claimed on interest of Rs.2,40,67,685/- in assessment year
2012-13 and the same was allowed in the assessment order framed under section
143(3) of the Act. Therefore, once identical interest has been held to be
eligible for deduction under section 10AA of the Act in assessment year
2012-13, there remains no justification for the AO to deny the claim of
deduction in the instant the year and, as such, is contrary to principles of
natural justice which has been upheld by the Hon'ble apex court in the case of
CIT vs. Excel industries Ltd., 358 ITR 295. Referring to the decision of the
Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of ACIT vs Motorola India Electronics
(P) Ltd., 265 CTR 94. He submitted that the Hon'ble High Court has upheld the
decision of the Tribunal wherein the Tribunal has held that the interest
received and the consideration received by sale of import entitlements has to
be construed as income of the business of the undertaking. It was held that
there is direct nexus between this income and the income of the business
undertaking. Referring to the following decisions, he submitted that in all
these decisions it has been held that interest income on account of the
deposits made from funds received from business are incidental to the
business:-  69
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> i) CIT vs. Paramount Premises (P) Ltd.;
> ii) CIT vs. Hindustan Gem & Chemicals Ltd., 72 taxmann.com 90 (Cal);
> iii) CIT vs. Chinna Nachimuthu Constructions,297 ITR 70 (Kar);
> iv) Satishchandra & Co. vs. CIT, 234 ITR 70 (Kar): and
> v) M/s Green Agro Pack P. Ltd. vs. CIT, ITA No.3112 of 2010 (Kar.).
87\. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in the case
of CIT vs Tirupati Woolen Mills Ltd., 193 ITR 252, he submitted that the
Hon'ble High Court has held that interest earned on deposits made with banks
is taxable as business income and not under the head 'other sources' as
investments are made by utilisation of commercial assets of the assesseee. For
the proposition that interest income from FD for obtaining credit facility
falls under the head 'profits and gains of business and profession' and is
eligible for deduction under section 10AA of the Act, the ld. counsel relied
on the following judicial precedents:-
> i) Livingstones Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT, 31 SOT 323 (Mum);
> ii) M/s Rajesh Exports Ltd. vs. ACIT, 2008-TIOL-457, ITAT Bangalore;
          iii)      Discover India Tours (P) Ltd. vs. AO, 9 SOT 665.
    88.   He also relied on the following decisions:-

> accordance with the law should be upheld.
90\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT (A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. The
only question to be decided in the impugned ground is regarding the
allowability of deduction under section 10AA of the Act of the 'other income'
of Rs.82,88,009/- being the interest income on short term deposits with banks
and other income. We find identical deduction was claimed by the assessee in
the immediately preceding assessment year and the AO in the order passed under
section 143(3) has allowed such claim under section 10AA to the extent of
Rs.1,40,67,685/-. We, therefore, find merit in the submission of the ld.
counsel that once identical interest income has been held to be eligible for
deduction under section 10AA of the Act in assessment year 2012-13, there
remains no justification for the AO to deny the claim of deduction in the
impugned assessment year. We find Hon'ble Karnataka  71 ITA Nos.5274 &
5275/Del/2017 High Court in the case CIT vs Motorola India Electronics Private
Limited, 265 CTR 94 while deciding an identical issue has observed as under:-
> "In s. 801A, the term "profits and gains from the business has been used.
> Similar terminology has been used m many other sections such as s. 80JJ or
> 80JJA, etc., whereas under s- 801 and other sections the terminology used is
> "profits and gains derived from industrial undertaking". The term "from the
> business of' is much wider than the term "derived from industrial
> undertaking.' Keeping this distinction in mind, we have to necessarily hold
> that the entire profits derived from the business of undertaking should be
> taken into consideration, while computing the eligible deduction under
> s.10B/10A of the Act, by applying the mandatory formula."
> "The issue becomes further clear when we look into the provisions of  s.
> 80HHC which are similar, as far as the education (sic) of deduction is
> concerned. As the legislature wanted to specifically exclude receipts by way
> of brokerage, commission, rent, charges or any other receipt of similar
> nature, from "the profits of the business, in s. 80HHC, it has specifically
> inserted Expln. (baa). If the legislature intended to exclude interest from
> the term 'profit of business of undertakings' under s. 10A/10B, a similar
> provision as in the case of Expln, (baa) would have been inserted. No such
> Explanation has been introduced in s. 10A/10B."
91\. We find, following the above decision the ld. CIT (A) has held that in
the absence of the use of the term 'derived from' in section 10AA (7) of the
Act, no nexus is required for the computation of deduction between the profits
in question and the undertaking. It is sufficient if the profits relate to the
business of the undertaking. We find the Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in
the case of Wipro Information Technology vs DCIT, ITA No.651/Bang/94 for
assessment year 1990- 91 after discussing the difference between the
provisions of 10A and 80HHC distinguished the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Sterling foods and has observed as under:-
72
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 "The word 'derived' is not defined in the Act.
> Hence we resort to the dictionary meaning of the same. The Oxford
> illustrated Dictionary defines the word 'derived' as 'get, obtain from a
> source, have one's or it's origin from, be descended or have one's.' In the
> case of a 100% export oriented unit, the origin or source of export benefits
> in the form of import entitlement is the business of export only. The scheme
> of the Govt, is only an enabling factor. The judgment of Hon'bie Supreme
> Court in the case of Sterling Foods (supra) is, therefore, distinguishable,
> since the present issue is u/s. 10A and not u/s. 80HH as in the said case of
> Sterling Foods (supra)"
> Further, the decision in Menon Impex and other decisions following it are no
> longer an authority. This is for the reason that the decision in Menon Impex
> was rendered in the context of section 10A, and pertained to the assessment
> year 1985-86. The law itself has undergone a change with the substitution of
> section 10A with effect from 01.04.2001. On this ground in AC1T v. Motorola
> India Electronics (P) Ltd., reported in 112 TTJ 562 (Bang), the tribunal
> held that the decisions in Menon Impex and those relying on Menon Impex have
> no application to substituted section 10A and similar provisions.
> The use of the words "profits of the business of the undertaking" in section
> 10AA(7) is very broad. This due to the fact that the two over lapping terms
> "business" and "business of the undertaking" forming part of the above
> expression are very broad in themselves.
> The term 'business' has been understood in a very broad sense by the Supreme
> Court in Continental Construction Ltd v. C1T, reported in 195 ITR 81 (SC) so
> as to include all activities, obligations and commitments which are
> incidental or ancillary to the operating part of the business. In the
> context of section 80HHB, the Supreme Court observed:
> "The expressions "business of execution of a foreign project" or work
> forming part of it or the 'profits derived' from the business, take in all
> aspects of a business involving the activities referred to in Sub-section
> (2) (b) of Section 80-HHB together with all activities, commitments and

> therefrom."
> The act of securing a letter of credit facility for imports with fixed
> deposits will be an activity incidental and connected with export business
> of assessee. Any income there from, including interest income will
> constitute profits of the business of the undertaking."
92\. We find Ahmedabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Zaveri & Co. (P)
Ltd. vs. CCIT, 48 taxmann.com 153 (Ahd) has observed as under:-  73
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 "41. The other connected issue is that as per
> the view of the Commissioner of Income Tax, the interest income in question
> being derived by the assessee from Indian Bank, the same is to be excluded
> while computing profits derived from the export of articles or things or

> section 10AA of the Act. Therefore, in view of the above specific provision
> in the section itself, "profits derived from the export of articles or
> things or services" cannot be computed in any other manner. Sub-section (7)
> of Section 1GAA reads as under:
> "For the purposes of sub-section (1), the profits derived from the export of

> assessment year beginning on the 1st day of April, 2006 and subsequent
> assessment years.]"
93\. We find Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of M/s Ossian Exports
Ltd., vide ITA No.1650/Mum/2015, has observed as under:-
> "7.3.3 We are of the considered opinion that the said interest receipts
> earned by the assessee out of FDs kept with banks by way of margin money
> made for the purposes of the assessee's business of import/export trading in
> diamonds, constitutes business receipts/income and is therefore eligible for
> deduction u/s 10AA of the Act. We hold and direct accordingly. Consequently
> assessee's appeal on grounds 1 to 3 is allowed."
94\. We find following the above decisions and various other decisions the ld.
CIT(A) has allowed the claim of deduction under section 10AA of the Act on the
interest income and 'other income.' The ld. CIT-DR could not distinguish the
various decisions relied on by the ld. CIT(A). In view of the above discussion
and in view of the detailed reasoning given by the CIT(A), while allowing the
claim of the assessee for deduction under section 10AA & interest income and
other  74 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 income, we do not find any infirmity in
the same. Accordingly, the same is upheld and the ground raised by the revenue
is dismissed.
95\. Ground of appeal No. 3 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> "3. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs.8,40,46,029/- made by the AO on
> account of Depreciation claimed on goodwill."
96\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the AO, during the course of
assessment proceedings observed that the assessee company has purchased the
business of M/s Planet Online Pvt. Ltd., through business transfer agreement
dated 01.06.2012 and created goodwill of Rs.33,61,84,116/- in financial year
2012-13 and claimed depreciation there on of Rs.8,40,46,029/-. He observed
that para 14 of the notes to accounts read as under:-
> "The Company acquired business of Planet Soft India Pvt. Limited for a
> consideration of Rs. 385 Millions (USD 7 Million). TRC Corporate Consulting
> Pvt. Ltd. has conducted the Fair Value of the business of Planet Soft at Rs.

75
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> 97\. He observed that Article IX of the Business Transfer Agreement reads as
> under:-
> 'Non-Compete: - In consideration for the purchase of Business, including the
> goodwill connected therewith, by the Purchaser. Seller agrees for a period
> of two years from the Transfer Date, motto directly or through an
> associate/Agent carry on or cause to carry on any business which is in
> competition with the Business."
> 98\. The AO noted that M/s Planet Software India Pvt. Ltd. had total Assets
> of Rs. 57.27 Millions as on 31.03.2012 and the net asset value was Rs. 31.03
> Millions. The assets represented tangible assets and there were no
> intangible assets.
The valuation report has valued Planet Online on the basis of DCF Method as
Rs. 409.93 Millions, which include value of Perpetuity Value of Rs. 343.03
Millions. He held that in view of above Article IX, it can be concluded that
the amount of Rs.374,052,401 Millions being the excess of purchase
consideration over the tangible assets of the business is in fact to be
treated as Payment for Non-Compete fee, as there was no Goodwill with the
Seller and the creation of Goodwill in the books is misleading.
99\. According to the AO the business of Planet Online Private Limited was to
engage in the development of enterprise solution for insurance companies to do
their new business software developed using Java/J2EE language and database
which the assessee company was already engaged in. Further, the assessee
company has not purchased any trade mark or new business technologies which
could have made any additional value in the hands of the assessee company.  76
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Further, the assessee was having set chain of the
supply of insurance for specified software for the insurance industry which
the assessee has purchased from Planet Online Private Limited. Therefore, he
held that the depreciation on goodwill is actually construed as depreciation
of non-compete fee in the light of the given facts and circumstances of the
case. Therefore, relying on various decisions the AO disallowed the claim of
depreciation of Rs.8,40,46,029/-.
100\. Before the CIT(A) it was submitted that the addition was made by the AO
based on fundamental misconception of facts and law. The finding of the AO
that excess of purchase money over tangible assets of the business is in fact
the payment of non- compete fee as there was no goodwill with the seller and
the creation of goodwill in the books is misleading was factually incorrect
and based on incorrect facts on record. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of CIT vs Smifs Securities Ltd., 348 ITR 302 was brought to
the notice of the CIT(A) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that
excess consideration paid by the assessee over the value of the net assets
acquired of amalgamating company and considered as goodwill arising on
amalgamation was in fact paid towards reputation which the amalgamating
company was enjoying in order to retain its existing clientele. It was, thus,
held that such goodwill is an eligible intangible asset for depreciation.
Various other decisions were also brought to the notice of the CIT(A).
77
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
101\. Based on the arguments advanced by the assessee, the ld CIT(A) directed
the AO to allow depreciation of Rs.8,40,46,029/-. The relevant observation of
the CIT(A) read as under:-
> "The Assessing Officer has held that the cost of the purchase consideration
> over the tangible assets is to be treated as payment for the non-compete
> fees as there was no goodwill with the seller and creation of the goodwill
> is misleading. The aforesaid finding is based on the complete misconception
> of facts and circumstances and the evidence placed on the record. It is
> reiterated that the fact that valuation report provides for a valuation of
> the business acquired by the company as on going concern at a higher sum
> than the book value and such value represents goodwill of the business. It
> is submitted that even the method of valuation as adopted in the valuation
> report is a discounted cash flow method of the revenue for the succeeding
> years which itself establish the submission of the appellant that amount has
> been paid for the goodwill of the assessee and not for a non-compete fee. It
> is to be highlighted that non compete fee clause is for a period of two
> years i.e. for the period from 1.5.2012 to 30.4.2014 whereas revenue as per

> Sharp Business System v. CIT reported in 254 CTR 233.
This judgment has no application to the facts of the case of the appellant. In
the said case, expenditure of Rs. 3 crores has been incurred towards non
compete fee and the same was claimed as revenue expenditure which on the facts
of the case was held to be capital expenditure. However, no such expenditure
has been claimed by the appellant company, in any case, a close reading of the
judgment would show that in the said case, non compete fee has been paid for a
period of seven years which was held to be enduring benefit and therefore,
such expenditure has been held to be capital expenditure. It is submitted that
in the said case, the appellant thereafter, made an alternative contention
that the expenditure be held to be intangible assets, eligible for
depreciation under section 32 of the Act. The Hon'ble Apex Court after
considering the judgment in the case of Techno Shares and Stock Brokers (P)
Ltd. (supra) and the judgment in the case of Hindustan Cola Beverages (supra)
78 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 held that there is no acquisition of non
competition agreement, it is restricted one and 'therefore, such a sum is not
eligible for the capital assets under section 32(1) of the Act. It was held
that expression 'similar business of commercial rights' has to be necessarily
result in an intangible asset against the entire world to be eligible for the
deprecation. The said judgment has no application on the facts of the instant
case more particularly when there is no independent agreement and there is no
specified consideration for non- compete fee having been paid by the company.
It is well settled law that an agreement is to be read as such. Reliance is
placed on the following judgments:
            a)     288 ITR 408 (SC) of Ishikawajima-Harima            Heavy
                   Industries ltd. s BIT
            b)     341     ITR 1 (SC) Vodafone International Holdings         B.V. v
                   UOI
            c)     173     ITR 479 (SC) C1T v Arvind Narottam
The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. Eicher Ltd. reported in
302 ITR 249 while examining the nature of non-compete fee laid the stress on
the length of period of restriction. The Hon'ble Court referring to Hon'ble
Supreme Court's judgment in Coat Shipment's case reported in 82 ITR 902 (SC)
has observed that payment made to ward off the competition in a business to a
rival dealer would constitute capital expenditure if the object of making that
payment is to derive an advantage by eliminating the competition over some
length of time, the same result would not follow if there is no certainty of
the duration of the advantage and the same can be put to an end at any time,
it was held that, "How long the period of contemplated advantage should be in
order to constitute enduring benefit would depend upon the circumstances and
the facts of each individual case." The Hon'ble Court also observed that, "to
decide whether an expenditure of this nature is a capital expenditure or not
would depend on the facts of the case. However, it is necessary to know
whether the advantage derived by the prayer is of an enduring nature, and for
this one of the considerations is the length of time for which the non-compete
agreement would operate although that is not decisive. While the length of
time for which computation is eliminated may not strictly be decisive in all
cases, yet, at the same time, it should not be so brief as to virtually be
transitory. The Court finally held that, "the assessee did not acquire any
capital asset by making the payment of non-compete fee of 4 crores. It merely
eliminated completion in the two wheeler business, for a definite period of
time." Therefore, the expenditure was held to be revenue in nature.
5.3 In view thereof, claim of non-compete fee without payment of any
consideration is though a part and parcel of the agreement and provided on  79
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 account of commercial expediency and business
necessity, yet the same cannot be made a basis to hold that excess of
consideration paid over, the book value assets is not goodwill, but payment
for non compete fee as claimed by the Assessing Officer. The judgment relied
by the Assessing Officer to deny the eligible deduction of depreciation on the
goodwill has been given in the different context and has no connection with
the facts of the given case In view of the above, the Assessing Officer is
directed to allow the depreciation of Rs.8,40,26,029/- and modify the order of
assessment accordingly"
102\. Aggrieved with such order of the CIT(A) the revenue is in appeal before
us.
103\. The Ld. DR strongly supported the order of the AO and submitted that the
findings of the CIT(A) is perfunctory and does not distinguish the decision in
the case of Sharp Business System, ITA no. 492/2012 and CM Appeal 14836/2012
and CIT vs Hindustan Coco Cola Beverages (P) Ltd.,331 ITR 192 (Delhi). He
submitted that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smifs
Securities Ltd. (supra) which has been relied on by the assessee is not
applicable to the facts of the present case since, in that case, the agreement
specifically contains an article of non-compete fee. Thus, the assessee cannot
take the stand that the purchase consideration in excess of tangible assets of
the business of the business was on account of goodwill and the stand of the
assessee was completely erroneous and contrary to the facts as per the
agreement. He accordingly submitted that the order of the CIT(A) be reversed
and that of the AO be restored.
104\. The ld. counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, heavily relied on
the order of the CIT(A) and submitted that the claim of the assessee is
covered by the business transfer agreement of Planet Online Private Limited
and valuation report. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of CIT vs  80 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 Smifs Securities Ltd.
(supra), he submitted that the Hon'ble apex court has held that excess
consideration paid by the assessee over the value of net assets acquired of
amalgamating company and considered as goodwill arising on amalgamation was,
in fact, paid towards the reputation which the amalgamating company was
enjoying in order to retain its existing clientele. It was, thus, held that
such goodwill is eligible intangible asset for depreciation. Referring to the
decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Triune Energy
Services (P) Limited vs DCIT, 237 Taxman 230 (Del), he submitted that the
Tribunal following the above decision of the Hon'ble Supreme court under
identical circumstances has deleted the disallowance. Relying on various other
decisions, he submitted that the CIT(A) is fully justified in deleting the
depreciation on goodwill.
105\. The ld. counsel submitted that the valuation report provides for the
valuation of the business acquired by the assessee company on a going concern
basis at a higher sum than the peak value it ought to have been held as the
goodwill of the business. He submitted that even the method of valuation as
adopted in valuation report is discounted cash flow method of the revenue for
the succeeding years which itself established submission of the assessee that
the amount has been paid for the goodwill of the assessee and not for a non-
compete fee. He submitted that the non- compete fee clause is for a period of
two years i.e., for the period from 01.06.2012 i.e., the transfer date to
31.05.2014 whereas revenue as per valuation report is for financial year
2012-13 to financial year March, 2017. This, according  81 ITA Nos.5274 &
5275/Del/2017 to the ld. counsel shows that the money paid and determined as
consideration based on the valuation report and accepted in the agreement with
M/s Planet Online Private Ltd. are in respect of goodwill and not in respect
of non-compete fee. He submitted that non-compete fee was an incidental
obligation of M/s Planet Online Pvt. Ltd. and there was no separate
consideration paid towards non- compete fees. He submitted that as per various
judicial precedents it has been consistently recognised and held that any sum
paid over and above the book value is to be held as exclusive unless there is
an agreement to the contrary and, thus, in absence of an agreement to the
contrary in any manner holding that the sum is paid towards non-compete fee is
absolutely misplaced and untenable.
106\. So far as the decision relied on by the AO in the case of Sharp Business
System vs. CIT, 254 CTR 233 is concerned the Ld. counsel submitted that this
decision has no application to the facts of the case of the assessee. In the
said case, the expenditure had been incurred of Rs.3 lacs towards non-compete
fee and the same was claimed as revenue expenditure and under the facts of
that case it was held to be a capital expenditure. However, no such
expenditure has been claimed by the assessee company. Further, in that case,
non- compete fee had been paid for a period of 7 years which was held to be
enduring benefit and, therefore, such expenditure has been held to be capital
expenditure. He submitted that in the said case, the assessee thereafter made
an alternate contention that the expenditure be held to be intangible asset
eligible for depreciation under Section 32. The Hon'ble  82 ITA Nos.5274 &
5275/Del/2017 Court after considering the judgement of the apex court in the
case of Techno Shares and Stock Brokers (P) Ltd. and the judgement in the case
of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (supra) held that there is no acquisition of
non-competition agreement, it is restricted one and, therefore, such sum is
not eligible capital asset u/s 32(1) of the Act. It was held that expression
'similar business of commercial rights' has to necessarily result in an
intangible asset against the entire world to be eligible for depreciation. He
submitted that the said judgement has no application on the facts of the
instant case when there is no independent agreement and there is no specified
consideration for non-compete fees having been paid by the assessee company.
Referring to the following decisions he submitted that agreement is to be read
as such:-
a) 288 ITR 408 (SC) of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Ltd.
          vs. DIT
          b)     341    ITR 1 (SC) Vodafone International Holdings B.V. v UOI
          c)     173    ITR 479 (SC) CIT v Arvind Narottam

> cannot be made a basis to hold that excess of consideration paid over the

> upheld and the ground raised by the Revenue be dismissed.
108\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the AO and the CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the
assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before us. A
perusal of the copy of the business transfer agreement shows that the preamble
of the agreement read as under:-
> "BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT This BUSINESS TRANSFER AGREEMENT ("Agreement")

84
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals
above, and the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and intending to

adjusted by such amount of the Receivable that have been transferred to the

transferred to the Purchaser and paid by the Seller.
3.4 It is clearly understood between the Parties that any amounts collected by
Seller on or after payment of full consideration, from the Receivables
transferred, shall be promptly transferred by Seller in favor of Purchaser."
Similarly, article 9 of the agreement read as under:-
"ARTICLE IX 9.1 Non Compete. In consideration for the purchase of Business,
including the goodwill connected therewith, by the Purchaser, Seller agrees
for a period of two years from the Transfer Date, not to directly or through
an associate/Agent carry on or cause to carry on any business which is in
competition with the Business.
109\. From the above it is seen that Planet Online Private Limited has
transferred to the purchaser, i.e., the assessee company its business
undertaking as a going concern, as a slump sale that is to say, of all the
assets, transferred employees, liabilities, licenses, contracts and
receivables as defined in definition schedule relating to the business, free
and clear of all liens, mortgages, pledges, security interests, restrictions,
prior assignments, encumbrances and claims of every kind, nature or character.
It has further been stated that as sole and entire consideration for the
purchase of a business undertaking, purchaser shall pay to the seller purchase
price equivalent to US dollars 7 million on and subject to the terms of
Article III hereinabove. The expression assets, liabilities, contracts,
receivables have been separately defined. Thus, apparently from the reading of
both Article II and III it is seen that there is no reference of payment of
purchase price being paid  87 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 for non-compete
fees. On the contrary, the entire purchase price has been paid for purchase of
the business undertaking and undertaking has been defined to include assets,
liabilities, contracts and receivables and not in connection with a non-
compete fees. There is no consideration paid by the assessee for non-complete
fee. A perusal of the valuation report, copy of which is placed at pages 117
to 139 of the paper book, shows that it has determined the valuation of the
business and does not refer in any manner to non-compete fees. Even the method
of valuation as adopted in the valuation report is a discounted cash flow
method of the revenue for the succeeding years which itself which itself
establishes the submission of the ld. counsel that amount has been paid for
the goodwill of the assessee and not for non- compete fees. Further the non-
compete clause is for a period of 2 years, i.e., for the period from
01.05.2012 to 30th April 2014 whereas the revenue as per the valuation report
is for financial year 2012-13 to financial year ended March, 2007. The clause
of non-compete fee without payment of any consideration is a part and parcel
of the agreement provided on account of commercial expediency and business
necessity. Such clause, in our opinion, cannot be made the basis to hold that
the excess consideration paid over the book value of assets is not goodwill,
but for payment of non-compete fee. As alleged in the order of assessment, no
material has been brought on record or any enquiries have been conducted to
allege that the consideration paid is for non-compete fee. There is no dispute
between the assessee and the Revenue that the sum paid as goodwill by the
assessee represents the difference between the purchase price of the business
and the net value of  88 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 assets acquired on slump
sale. The only dispute between the assessee and the Revenue is that according
to the Revenue the amount of difference between the purchase price and the
value of the assets should be allocated to non-compete fee in view of article
IX of the agreement. However, in the light of the clear provision of Article
II and III of the agreement, we do not find any merit in the aforesaid
argument of the Revenue.
110\. We find the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Smifs
Securities (supra) has held that excess consideration paid by the assessee
over the value of net assets acquired by amalgamating company should be
considered as goodwill arising on amalgamation and such goodwill is eligible
asset for depreciation. The relevant observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
reads as under:-
> "1. None appears for the respondent, though served. Heard learned counsel
> for the Department. Leave granted. This civil appeal concerns the Assessment
> Year 2003-2004. Three questions arise for determination by this Court. They
> are as follows:
> Question No.[a]: "Whether Stock Exchange Membership Cards are assets
> eligible for depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961?
> Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, deletion of Rs.
> 53,84,766/- has been made correctly?"
> Answer: Learned Additional Solicitor General fairly concedes that the said
> question is covered by the decision of this Court in the case of Techno
> Shares and Stocks Limited vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, reported in [2010]
> 327 I.T.R. 323, in favour of the assessee.
> Question No.[b]: "Whether goodwill is an asset within the meaning of Section
> 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and whether depreciation on 'goodwill' is
> allowable under the said Section?"
> Answer: In the present case, the assessee had claimed deduction of Rs.
> 54.85,430/- as depreciation on goodwill. In the course of hearing, the
> explanation regarding origin of such goodwill was given as under:
89
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 "In accordance with Scheme of Amalgamation of
> YSN Shares & Securities (P) Ltd with Smifs Securities Ltd (duly sanctioned
> by Hon'ble High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta) with retrospective effect
> from 1st April, 1998, assets and liabilities of YSN Shares & Securities (P)
> Ltd were transferred to and vest in the company. In the process goodwill has
> arisen in the books of the company."
2\. It was further explained that excess consideration paid by the assessee
over the value of net assets acquired of YSN Shares and Securities Private
Limited [Amalgamating Company] should be considered as goodwill arising on
amalgamation. It was claimed that the extra consideration was paid towards the
reputation which the Amalgamating Company was enjoying in order to retain its
existing clientele.
3\. The Assessing Officer held that goodwill was not an asset falling under
Explanation 3 to Section 32(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ['Act', for short].
We quote hereinbelow Explanation 3 to Section 32(1) of the Act: "Explanation
3.-- For the purposes of this sub-section, the expressions 'assets' and 'block
of assets' shall mean-- [a] tangible assets, being buildings, machinery, plant
or furniture;
[b] intangible assets, being know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks,
licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar
nature."
4\. Explanation 3 states that the expression 'asset' shall mean an intangible
asset, being know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, franchises
or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature. A reading the
words 'any other business or commercial rights of similar nature' in clause
(b) of Explanation 3 indicates that goodwill would fall under the expression
'any other business or commercial right of a similar nature'. The principle of
ejusdem generis would strictly apply while interpreting the said expression
which finds place in Explanation 3(b).
5\. In the circumstances, we are of the view that 'Goodwill' is an asset under
Explanation 3(b) to Section 32( 1) of the Act.
6\. One more aspect needs to be highlighted. In the present case, the
Assessing Officer, as a matter of fact, came to the conclusion that no amount
was actually paid on account of goodwill. This is a factual finding. The
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) '(CIT(A)', for short has come to the
conclusion that the authorised representatives had filed copies of the Orders
of the High Court ordering amalgamation of the above two Companies: that the
assets and liabilities of M/s. YSN Shares and Securities Private Limited were
transferred to the assessee for a consideration; that the difference between
the  90 ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 cost of an asset and the amount paid
constituted goodwill and that the assessee-Company in the process of
amalgamation had acquired a capital right in the form of goodwill because of
which the market worth of the assessee- Company stood increased. This finding
has also been upheld by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal 'ITAT', for short. We
see no reason to interfere with the factual finding.
7\. One more aspect which needs to be mentioned is that, against the decision
of 1TAT, the Revenue had preferred an appeal to the High Court in which it had
raised only the question as to whether goodwill is an asset under Section 32
of the Act. In the circumstances, before the High Court, the Revenue did not
file an appeal on the finding of fact referred to hereinabove.
8\. For the afore-stated reasons, we answer Question No.[b] also in favour of
the assessee."
111\. We find the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Triune Energy
Services (P) Ltd. vs. DCIT,237 Taxman 230 has decided identical issue and
following the above decision of Hon'ble apex court has allowed depreciation on
goodwill by observing as under:-
> "19. In view of the above, we are inclined to accept the contention advanced
> on behalf of the Assessee that the consideration paid by the Assessee in
> excess of its value of tangible assets was rightly classified as goodwill.
> 20\. In the facts of the present case, the ITAT has rejected the view that
> the slump sale agreement was a colourable device. Once having held so, the
> agreement between the parties must be accepted in its totality. The
> Agreement itself does not provide for splitting up of the intangibles into
> separate components. Indisputably, the transaction in question is a slump
> sale which does not contemplate separate values to be ascribed to various
> assets (tangible and intangible) that constitute the business undertaking,
> which is sold and purchased. The Agreement itself indicates that slump sale
> included sale of goodwill and the balance sheet drawn up on 22nd September,
> 2006 specifically recorded goodwill at Rs.40,58,75,529.40/-. As indicated
> hereinbefore Goodwill includes a host of intangible assets, which a person
> acquires, on acquiring a business as a going concern and valuing the same at
> the excess consideration paid over and above the value of net tangible
> assets is an acceptable accounting practice. Thus, a further exercise to
> value the goodwill is not warranted.
91
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
> 21\. In view of the aforesaid, the question framed is answered in the
> negative, that is, in favour of the ITA No.1744/Del/2015 Assessee and
> against the Revenue. The Assessee's appeal (ITA No. 40/2015) is,
> accordingly, allowed."
112\. The various other decisions relied on by Ld. counsel also support his
case that the excess consideration paid by the assessee over the value of net
assets acquired of amalgamating company should be considered as goodwill
arising of amalgamation and depreciation is allowable on such goodwill.
113\. So far as the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sharp
Business Systems vs CIT, reported in 254 CTR 233 and relied on by the ld. DR
is concerned the same, in our opinion, is not applicable to the facts of the
present case. In that case, expenditure had been incurred of Rs.3 crores
towards non- compete fee and the same was claimed as revenue expenditure which
on the facts of that case was held to be capital expenditure. In that case,
the assessee also made an alternate contention that the expenditure be held to
be intangible assets, eligible for depreciation under Section 32 of the IT
Act. The Hon'ble High Court after considering the judgement of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Techno Shares and Stocks Ltd. vs.CIT, 327 ITR 323
and the judgement in the case of Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd. 331 ITR
192 held that non-compete fee is not eligible Capital Asset under Section
32(1) of the Act. However, since no expenditure has been incurred by the
assessee company as non-compete fee, this decision is not applicable to the
facts of the present case and distinguishable. In this view of the matter and
in view of the detailed reasoning given by the ld.  92
ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017 CIT(A) on this issue, we do not find any
infirmity in the order of the CIT(A). Accordingly, the ground raised by the
Revenue is dismissed. ITA No.5275/Del/2017 (A.Y. 2014-15)
114\. Ground of appeal No.1 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> "1. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs. 2,26,98,41,758/- made by the AO
> on account of business income from 6 units.
115\. After hearing both the sides we find the above ground is identical to
Ground of appeal No.1 in ITA No.5274/Del/2017. We have already decided this
issue and the ground raised by the Revenue has been dismissed. Following
similar reasonings this ground raised by the Revenue is dismissed.
116\. Ground of appeal No.2 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> 2\. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs. 82,88,099/- made by the AO on
> account of other income from 4 SEZ units.
117\. After hearing both the sides we find the above ground is identical to
Ground of appeal No.2 in ITA No.5274/Del/2017. We have already decided this
issue and the ground raised by the Revenue has been dismissed. Following
similar reasonings this ground raised by the Revenue is dismissed.
118\. Ground of appeal No.3 by the Revenue reads as under:-
> 3\. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred on law and on the facts
> of the case in deleting the addition of Rs. 8,40,46,029/- made by the AO on
> account of Depreciation claimed on goodwill.
93
> ITA Nos.5274 & 5275/Del/2017
119\. After hearing both the sides we find the above ground is identical to
Ground of appeal No.3 in ITA No.5274/Del/2017. We have already decided this
issue and the ground raised by the Revenue has been dismissed. Following
similar reasonings this ground raised by the Revenue is dismissed.
120\. In the result, both the appeals filed by the Revenue are dismissed.
