prosecution on the basis of a private complaint in the absence of a complaint

produced would not be sustainable. In view of the same, the Writ Petition is
liable to be allowed and is accordingly allowed quashing FIR No.29 of 2010

2009 on the file of the XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and
Special Court for Trial of Video Piracy Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad, on the
ground that the accused cannot be tried for the offence under the provisions
of Copy Right Act in the absence of registration of Copy Right and in any
event, the accused not being the publisher is not liable. These issues have to
be decided after trial in the case. Prima facie, the absence of particulars on
the video film as mandated under Section 52A itself is an infringement of
copyright as held by the Supreme Court in Nagoti Venkataramanas case (supra)
and hence it cannot be held that the petitioner has not violated the law.
Hence the Charge Sheet filed in the case cannot be quashed. Consequently, the

These Writ Petitions are being disposed of by this common order as they all
seek quashing of Crimes in the respective petitions.
WRIT PETITION No.21422 of 2002
2\. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the learned Counsel for
the respondents.
3\. The petitioners are the Executive Members of the Jubilee Hills Cooperative
House Building Society who were elected in November 2000\. Prior to that, the
Society was under the management of the Official-Person-In-charge Committee
appointed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies after superseding the
earlier Managing Committee. While so, the third respondent issued a show cause
notice on 26.03.2002 calling for explanation from the petitioners and others
as to why the Managing Committee should not be superseded under Section 34(1)
of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act on the grounds stated in the
said show cause notice. The petitioners submitted explanation and without
considering the same, the third respondent passed an order on 18.05.2002
superseding the Managing Committee and appointing the second respondent as the
Special Officer to manage the affairs of the Society. Aggrieved by the same,
the petitioners filed an appeal before the Cooperative Tribunal, Hyderabad on
02.07.2002. The third respondent appointed one Sri K.Srinivasulu, Joint
Registrar to conduct an enquiry into the affairs of the Society under Section
51 of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act. Pursuant to the same, Sri
K.Srinivasulu issued a notice on 30.09.2002 calling upon the petitioners to
appear before him on 17.10.2002 for enquiry. He submitted a report pursuant to
the enquiry on 21.10.2002 and on the basis of the report, the third respondent
directed the second respondent to lodge a criminal complaint against the
petitioners and others with the first respondent. Accordingly, the second
respondent lodged a complaint with the first respondent on 25.10.2002 at 10:40
pm. Upon receipt of the said complaint, the first respondent registered the
same as Crime No.326 of 2002 under Sections 406, 423, 465, 467, 477(A) IPC and
under Sections 79(1)(f), 79(1)(h) and Sections 83(B)(1)(d) of the Andhra
Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act. Challenging the same the present Writ
Petition was filed.
4\. In the complaint it was alleged that the petitioners along with others
formed into a ring and concocted a plan to dole out 7 pieces of society land
meant for public utility in the name of lease for 50 years entering into a
clandestine understanding with some members and accepted graft in huge amounts
and they termed this operation as Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) and showed
in the file that they issued notification in the press calling for open
tenders or by other means of Media and they have also cooked up the record in
their favour without following the due procedure for this transaction. The
entry in the file as to cheques issued as EMD were all bogus and the
Accountant of the Society had given a statement that neither tenders nor
cheques were received from anybody. It is further stated that Sri
T.Sreenivasulu, Joint Registrar, Managing Director, had submitted the inquiry
report under Section 51 of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act on the
so called BOT transaction by the Society and recommended for criminal action
for criminal breach of trust under IPC and other relevant Sections. The
statutory enquiry under Section 51 of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies
Act also brought out five irregularities in the functioning of the Society and
they also constituted various offences punishable under the Andhra Pradesh
Cooperative Societies Act and IPC. It was alleged that the transactions were
done by tampering the records by incorporating false resolutions.
5\. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that the management of the
Society was superseded on the selfsame allegations and an appeal was preferred
before the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Tribunal against the order of
supersession. Since the allegations relate to the management of the Society,
it cannot be said that any action taken by the members of the Committee can
constitute an offence under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the
provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act.
6\. Learned Counsel for the second respondent submits that the allegations
mentioned in the enquiry report can form the basis for supersession of the
managing committee as well as taking action under the provisions of the Indian
Penal Code. The truth or otherwise of the said allegations have to be enquired
by the Police and at the threshold it cannot be said that investigation should
not be made in respect of those allegations. He further submits that the
allegations were based on the enquiry report submitted by the Joint Registrar
of Cooperative Societies and also on the basis of the note submitted by the
Vigilance and Enforcement Department.
WRIT PETITION No.4687 of 2010
7\. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government
Pleader for the first respondent. None appeared for the fourth respondent.
8\. The petitioner is the daughter of Sri Javid Ali of Peddapalli. Her
marriage with Sri Shahzaad Aufauqui took place on 01.02.2008, and her husband
is employed in Saudi Arabia. She applied for issuance of Indian passport vide
File No.HYD/Z/152493/2008 dated 01.03.2008 and she was not informed about the
status of the passport by the third respondent, in spite of several visits to
his office. The fourth respondent is the divorced wife of her husband. In
order to deny the passport to the petitioner, she foisted false criminal cases
by filing private complaints in the Court of the learned First Special
Judicial Magistrate of Second Class, Karimnagar, one after another with same
witnesses and similar allegations. The cases filed by her in C.C.No.776 of
2007 and C.C.No.335 of 2008 ended in acquittal and dismissed on 25.08.2008 and
24.02.2009 respectively. Now, only one case in C.C.No.285 of 2009 is pending
on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate of Second Class, Karimnagar.
The petitioner further states that the witnesses are same in all the cases
i.e., Smt.Matam Laxmi and Sri Abdul Nayeem. The allegations are also similar.
While filing the complaints, she did not show the pendency of the earlier
criminal cases. Though A-8 in C.C.No.285 of 2009 was out of country since
28.08.2007, she was implicated in the case. The fourth respondent has no
regard to truth and is abusing the process of law. The petitioner, therefore,
filed the present Writ Petition for quashing the private complaint in
C.C.No.285 of 2009 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate of Second
Class, Karimnagar, and also sought an order for issuance of passport, pending
disposal of the Writ Petition.
9\. This Court, by order dated 02.03.2010, directed the third respondent to
consider the petitioners application for issuance of passport, without
reference to C.C.No.285 of 2009, pending on the file of the learned Judicial
Magistrate of Second Class, Karimnagar.
10\. It is represented by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that pursuant
to the said order, passport was issued to the petitioner. A reading of the
complaint shows that when the complainant along with LWs 1 and 2 got down the
bus at Ambedkar Chowrasta, Karimnagar, for medical check up on 24.02.2009 at
about 5:00 pm, the petitioner along with others suddenly pounced on her,
abused her in filthy language such as suvvar, Gadhe and kamine etc., and beat
her with hands on several parts of the body. LWs 1 and 2 intervened and
reported the matter, and when they did not take any action, she filed the
complaint.
11\. Learned Counsel filed copies of the complaint in C.C.No.335 of 2008 as
well as C.C.No.776 of 2007. The allegations are same in both the cases. In
view of the above allegations, it has to be seen whether the complaint made
against the petitioner by the fourth respondent is bona fide or abuse of
process of law.
WRIT PETITION No.8096 of 2010
12\. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the learned Government
Pleader for respondent Nos.1 to 3, and the learned Counsel for the fourth
respondent.
13\. The petitioners along with eleven others entered into a partnership under
the name and style of M/s.Dwaraka Real Estate, Nellore, for the purpose of
dealing in the purchase, development of land, sites and other real estate
activities. It was registered on 24.09.1984 with the Registrar of Firms,
Hyderabad. A registered General Power of Attorney was executed on 25.03.1985
giving authority to the petitioners. In the year 1988 one of the partners, Sri
P.Kannaiah, passed away, and the firm was reconstituted. Thereafter, some
misunderstandings arose among the partners. One of the partners filed
O.S.No.446 of 2005 on the file of the learned I Additional Senior Civil Judge,
Nellore, for dissolution of the partnership firm and to recover his share in
profits and assets. The fourth respondent in the present Writ Petition was
arrayed as the ninth defendant in the suit.
14\. While so, the fourth respondent sent a representation to the first
respondent on 14.03.2010 stating that the reconstituted firm was dissolved on
30.06.1991, as it was constituted for a fixed term till 30.06.1991. No Power
of Attorney was executed by the reconstituted firm and, in any event, the
earlier power came to an end by dissolution of the firm on 30.06.1991. But, by
falsely representing to the public that they were having a General Power of
Attorney dated 25.03.1985, the first and second petitioners induced the
purchasers into a false belief and sold certain plots to scheme members, and
again sold the same plots to the partners of the firm and their associates.
They opened a current account in the Andhra Bank, R.R.Street, Nellore, to
obtain bank guarantee, and the partners deposited fixed amounts in the said
branch, and the first and second petitioners were authorized to operate the
said account. When the National Highway Authority acquired the lands of the
firm for formation of the National Highway and paid compensation of
Rs.10,84,700/-, the first, second and fourth petitioners received the said
amount but did not bring it to the accounts of the firm and misappropriated
the same. Stating as such, he requested the first respondent for investigation
by CID branch, Tirupathi, on the ground that they committed offences
punishable under Sections 419, 420, 409 IPC read with 120(B) IPC. Thereafter,
the first respondent obtained an opinion from the Legal Assistant, CID,
Hyderabad, which reads as follows:-
It can be seen that partners of the firm The Dwaraka Real Estates had executed
a registered GPA on 25.03.1985 for a fixed period of seven years in favour of
3 partners, D.Laxmi Narayana, P.Sesha Reddy and P.Badri Narayana Rao, to look
after the affairs of the firm and to conduct business.
Subsequently, one of the partners died and hence remaining partners
reconstituted the firm. No fresh GPA was executed in favour of the above said
GPA holders.
Finally, the firm was dissolved in the year 1991. In spite of such
dissolution, above said persons, under the authority of GPA executed in the
year 1985, continued to sell plots which can be said they did it without any
authority. The company being dissolved, any transaction in the capacity of GPA
holder is null and void and amounts to an offence of cheating as their right
extinguishes with dissolution of partnership and the relation of principal and
agent ceases to exist between executants and GPA holders. It is also evident
from the petitions enclosures that a legal notice was also issued in the year
2003 to GPA holders, stating that they were no more agents of the company.
Even after such intimation, during the years 2004-2005, GPA holders conducted
business with mollified intention and failed to account for, to the firm.
Though the matter between the parties is a civil dispute, liability of a
person can be both civil and criminal at the same time.
Therefore, a case can be registered u/s.420 IPC r/w 34 IPC.
After extracting such opinion in the Memo bearing C.No.3261/C3/CID/2010 dated
05.03.2010, he directed the second respondent to take action. The second
respondent endorsed the said memo to the third respondent to register the case
and take necessary action, in pursuance of which FIR No.66 of 2010 was
registered in P.S.Nellore IV Town.
15\. The present Writ Petition is filed for quashing FIR No.66 of 2010 dated
14.03.2010 on the file of the Nellore IV Town P.S.
16\. Though the fourth respondent filed a detailed counter affidavit, it is
not necessary to traverse the averments made therein, in view of the disputed
facts leading to the filing of the complaint and in view of the narrow compass
within which this lis has to be decided.
17\. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submits as follows:
(i) In respect of the disputes among the partners, O.S.No.446 of 2005 is
pending on the file of the learned I Additional Senior Civil Judge, Nellore,
and the present complaint is not maintainable at the instance of the erstwhile
partner.
(ii) There is no complaint from any purchaser or from any third party alleging
fraud or improper conduct by the petitioners.
(iii) Though the firm was dissolved on 30.06.1991, as per the complaint
itself, the complaint was lodged on 14.03.2010 with the first respondent with
a statement that the persons involved were influential at Nellore and the
local Police were not inclined to take appropriate action. The complainant did
not avail the remedies open under the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure before approaching the first respondent and thus, the complaint is
not maintainable.
(iv) The complaint lodged by the fourth respondent is mala fide and the
allegations are of civil nature.
18\. Learned Counsel for the petitioners relied on Bhuban Mohan Das v.
Surendra Mohan Das , B.Suresh Yadav v. Sharifa Bee , and Vankina
Chamundeswaranath v. S.H.O.Nagarampalem Law and Order in support of his
contentions.
19\. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the fourth respondent submits as
follows:
(i) The criminal law can be set in motion by any person and not necessarily by
the aggrieved.
(ii) The complaint was lodged since the complainant came to know of the
transactions just before the complaint and as he was not aware of the
fraudulent activities earlier, he did not give a complaint earlier.
(iii) The complainant gave reason for not approaching the local Police and the
representation to the first respondent is maintainable, and the crime was
validly registered on the basis of such complaint.
20\. Learned Counsel for the fourth respondent relied on N.Natarajan v.
B.K.Subba Rao , Shriram Krishnappa Asegaonkar v. State of Maharashtra , Arun
Bhandari v. State of Uttar Pradesh , Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd.
, Kamaladevi Agarwal v. State of West Bengal and B.Sudhakar Reddy v. The S.H.O
.
21\. Now the point for consideration is whether FIR No.66 of 2010 is liable to
be quashed on the grounds raised by the learned Counsel for the petitioners.
22\. It is the admitted case of the parties that the petitioners and the
fourth respondent were partners of M/s.Dwaraka Real Estate, Nellore. They were
doing business under a registered partnership deed dated 24.09.1984, which was
reconstituted consequent to the death of one of the partners in the year 1988.
In respect of the disputes among the partners, O.S.No.446 of 2005 is pending
on the file of the learned I Additional Senior Civil Judge, Nellore. When all
the partners were doing real estate business, certain sales took place during
the course of their business activities, and the learned Counsel for the
fourth respondent submits that the sales were made by misusing the Power of
Attorney granted in favour of the first and second petitioners at the time of
formation of partnership initially.
23\. The Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Bhuban Mohan Dass case
(supra) held that a charge under Section 406 IPC cannot be framed against a
person who, according to the complainant, is a partner with him and is accused
of the offence in respect of property belonging to both of them as partners.
24\. In the decision reported in B.Suresh Yadavs case (supra) the Supreme
Court considered the case of a party to an agreement against whom a complaint
was made alleging commission of an offence under Section 420 IPC when a suit
was pending in relation to the same subject matter before a Civil Court. The
Supreme Court considered the ingredients of cheating and accepted the
arguments of the appellant that the allegations contained in the complaint
petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in their entirety,
do not disclose any offence, and accordingly quashed the proceedings.
25\. In Suneet Gupta v. Anil Triloknath Sharma the Supreme Court considered
the case of involvement of partners in respect of offences punishable under
Sections 468, 406 read with 120B IPC and upheld the order of the High Court as
the allegations were of civil nature.
26\. A learned single Judge of this Court in Vankina Chamundeswaranaths case
(supra) considered the scope of Article 226 of the Constitution of India in
relation to Section 482 Cr.P.C and held that in view of the ratio of the Apex
Court in Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate a Writ Petition can
be maintained.
27\. Learned Counsel for the fourth respondent relied on N.Natarajans case
(supra) for the proposition that in criminal law, a complaint can be lodged by
anyone who has become aware of a crime having been committed and thereby set
the law into motion. In the instant case, though the complainant is not an
affected party it is submitted that in view of the ratio laid down in the
above case, he can maintain the complaint. He relied on a decision reported in
Shriram Krishnappa Asegaonkars case (supra) for the same proposition. He also
relied on Arun Bhandaris case (supra) and contends that though the complaint
may reveal a commercial transaction or a money transaction, but that is hardly
a reason for holding that the offence of cheating would elude from such a
transaction. He also relied on Indian Oil Corporations case (supra), wherein
the principles relating to the quashing of a compliant were enumerated. He
submits that though the petitioners may have several defenses, those defenses
have to be put forth and considered during the trial and at the threshold the
complaint cannot be quashed. For the same proposition he relied on Kamaladevi
Agarwals case (supra). Ultimately he also relied on B.Sudhakar Reddys case
(supra) and relied on the following observations:
It is not as if the petitioner-accused would suffer irreparable loss and
injury if the FIR is not quashed, for it would only result in the complaint
being investigated; and if the investigation reveals that the accused has not
committed the offence, alleged against him under the Act, he cannot be
proceeded against thereafter; and, even otherwise, he would be entitled to
avail his legal remedies at that stage WRIT PETITION No:8786 of 2010:
28\. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government
Pleader for the first respondent.
29\. The case of the petitioner is that the second respondent filed
O.S.No.1145 of 2006 on the file of the learned I Junior Civil Judge, City
Civil Court, Secunderabad, for recovery of Rs.16,340.50 ps. together with
interest. The trial Court decreed the suit ex parte on 10.04.2007 for the said
sum with future interest at 5% per annum along with costs. He filed E.P.No.1
of 2009 on the file of the learned Junior Civil Judge, Yellareddy, Nizamabad,
for realization of the decretal amount. The said proceedings are pending.
While so, the second respondent filed a private complaint before the learned
Judicial First Class Magistrate, Yellareddy, on 12.04.2010 under Section 420
IPC on the allegation that the Panchayat Secretary issued a certificate dated
19.03.2010 showing the house number 4-2-64 and 4-2-65 stood in the name of the
petitioner and issued ownership certificate. The learned Magistrate referred
the same to the first respondent and FIR No.29 of 2010 was registered under
Section 420 IPC by the first respondent and the investigation was in progress.
Challenging the said registration of crime, the present Writ Petition was
filed.
30\. The complaint reads as follows:
1\. Brief facts of the case are that the complainant filed a Execution
Petition before the Honble Junior Civil Judges Court, Yellareddy which is
numbered as E.P.No.1 of 2009 against the accused for attachment of House
No.4-2-64 and 4- 2-65. The accused herein appeared before the Honble Junior
Civil Judges Court, Yellareddy and filed his counter affidavit on 04.12.2009
through his Advocate Sri G.Gopal Rao, Advocate- Yellareddy in which the
accused denied the ownership of House No.4-2-64 and 4-2-65. The said counter
affidavit is attested by Sri Sai Prakash Deshpande, Advocate-Yellareddy on
04.12.2009. The complainant approached the Grama Sachivalayam, Yellareddy and
filed an application to issue ownership certificate in respect of House
No.4-2-64 and 4-2-65 under the provisions of Right to Information Act and the
LW-1 who is Panchayat Secretary, Yellareddy issued a certificate dated
19.03.2010 showing the House No.4-2-64 and 4-2-65 stands in the name of the
accused and issued ownership certificate. Thus the accused cheated the
complainant through his counter affidavit dated 04.12.2009 that the accused is
not the owner of House No.4-2-64 and 4-2-65. But according to the ownership
certificate issued by LW-2 the accused in the owner of House No.4-2-64 and
4-2-65. As such the accused cheated the complainant and mis-represented the
facts to the Honble Junior Civil Judges Court, Yellareddy through his counter
affidavit dated 04.12.2009 which is filed by the accused through his Advocate
Sri G.Gopal Rao (LW-2) and the said counter affidavit is signed by the accused
on oath in the presence of Sri Sai Prakash Deshpande (LW-3), Advocate-
Yellareddy.
2\. The acts of the accused constitute the offence under Section 420 IPC.
WRIT PETITION No.17623 of 2010
31\. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government
Pleader for the respondents.
32\. This is another Writ Petition seeking quashing of charge sheet in
C.C.No.605 of 2009 on the file of the learned XV Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate and Special Court for Trial of Video Piracy Cases, Nampally,
Hyderabad.
33\. The petitioner states that he is a petty business man running video
parlour at Shop No.36, Brundavan Complex, Beasant Road, Vijayawada, and eking
out his livelihood by hiring and selling VCDs and DVDs of various pictures for
the last 12 years produced by the concerned production companies. While so, on
17.02.2009 at about 5.00 a.m., the Sub-Inspector of Police, Vijayawada along
with mediators entered his shop. When the petitioner was sitting in his shop
they started enquiring him his details with regard to name, age, occupation
etc. and also enquired as to the possession of VCDs and DVDs having
copyrights. They were accompanied by one Sri P.V.Satyanarayana, who claimed to
be the Coordinator, Anti Video Piracy Cell of Andhra Pradesh Film Chambers.
The fifth respondent recorded the statement of the petitioner and seized 371
DVDs of 24 movies from his shop. Thereafter, the fifth respondent registered
Crime No.46 of 2009 in P.S.Governorpet under Sections 52A and 63 of the
Copyright Act, 1957. The petitioner was arrested on 17.02.2009 and sent to
judicial custody. Later he was released on bail. After investigation, the
Police filed charge sheet on the file of the learned XV Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate and Special Court for Trial of Video Piracy Cases,
Nampally, Hyderabad, and the same is pending.
34\. Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that Section 52A of the
Copyright Act casts a duty on the publisher to display the information
mentioned in the said Section. Section 63 of the Copyright Act makes it
punishable if the person not only infringes or abets the infringement of the
copyright in a work or any other right conferred by this Act (except the right
conferred by Section 53A). The said Section provides that if the infringement
has not been made for gain in the course of trade or business the Court may
impose a lesser punishment. When the petitioner is selling CDs and DVDs he
cannot be called as a publisher and no offence can be attributed to him. He
also submits that unless the particular movie or product is duly registered
under Sections 44 and 45 of the Copyright Act, no action can be taken for the
alleged infringement of copyright. He also submits that none of the
owners/producers of the movies have registered their work under the provisions
of the Copyright Act but they are entering into individual agreements on non-
judicial stamp papers with private parties and conveying their right to them
in respect of their movies and it has nothing to do with the Copyright Act. He
relied on Dhiraj Dharamdas Dewani v. Sonal Info Systems Pvt. Ltd. , Brundabad
Sahu v. B.Rajendra Subudhi , B.K.Dani v. State of M.P , V.Errabhadrarao v.
B.N.Sarma , Muppala Ranganayakamma v. Smt.K.Ramalakshmi and Ushodaya
Enterprises Limited v. T.V.Venugopal in support of his contention.
35\. On the other hand, learned Government Pleader submits that absence of
particulars on the video film as mandated under Section 52A itself is an
infringement of copyright as held by the Supreme Court in State of A.P v.
Nagoti Venkataramana and hence it cannot be held that the petitioner has not
violated the law.
LAW ON QUASHING OF COMPLAINTS/CHARGE SHEETS UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF THE
CONSTITUTION OF INDIA:
36\. Now the above cases have to be examined in the light of the law laid down
by the Apex court.
37\. The Supreme Court, after considering various decisions in the famous case
in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, listed out the categories of cases, wherein
the power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be exercised
either to prevent the abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure
the ends of justice and such cases are as follows: (1) Where the allegations
made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken
at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials,
if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying
an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except
under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of
any offence and make out a case against the accused; (4) Where the allegations
in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-
cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without
an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code; (5)
Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a
just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused;
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of
the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is
instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where
there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing
efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party;
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or
where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for
wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private
and personal grudge.
38\. In Gudavalli Murali Krishna v. Gudavalli Madhavi this Court had an
occasion to consider the issue with regard to the maintainability of the
petitions to quash the FIR under Section 482 Cr.P.C. This Court extensively
considered the scope of Section 482 Cr.P.C and ultimately held that the
inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked to
quash the proceedings even at the threshold be it a FIR or a complaint or a
charge sheet. The inherent powers to be exercised by the High Court under
Section 482 Cr.P.C is an efficacious remedy. When such an alternative remedy
is available, the High Court should be loath and circumspect to exercise its
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
39\. The said order of the learned single Judge was followed by another
learned single Judge in Killaparthi Suri Appa Rao v. Sub- Inspector of Police,
Devarapalli P.S. , who held that a Writ Petition for quashing FIR cannot be
entertained as the petitioner has an effective remedy of approaching this
Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
40\. A three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Mahavir Prashad Gupta v.
State of National Capital Territory of Delhi quoted with approval the addition
of another qualification mentioned in Bhajan Lals case (supra), that the power
of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with
circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The same principle
was reiterated in M.Narayandas v. State of Karnataka .
41\. The Supreme Court again in State of Bihar v. Md.Khalique quoted with
approval the ratio laid down in Bhajan Lals case (supra).
42\. In view of the above decisions, the ratio laid down in Bhajan Lals case
(supra) rules the field. This Court is not denuded of the power to quash the
proceedings in appropriate cases when the aggrieved invoke the jurisdiction of
this court. But what this Court has to see is the reason for not invoking the
alternative remedy available under Code of Criminal Procedure apart from the
law laid down by the Apex court while dealing with this type of cases. When
these principles are kept in mind, the following relief has to be granted in
the above Writ Petitions.
RELIEF:
43\. In W.P.21422 of 2002, the complaint was filed by the Joint
Registrar/Special Officer of Jubilee Hills Coop. House Building Society,
Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, on the basis of inquiry report submitted under
Section 51 of Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act and the report of the
Vigilance & Enforcement Department. The inquiry officer who conducted an
enquiry under Section 51 of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act gave
individual findings in respect of each charge and submitted a report to the
fourth respondent on 21.10.2002. The Vigilance & Enforcement Department, Govt.
of A.P. have enquired into the allegations against the Managing Committee of
the Society on the issue of giving BOT contract to certain interested persons
in violation of procedures & norms and concluded that the action of the
Managing Committee of the Society has been against the overall interest of the
Societys members. The fourth respondent had come to the prima facie opinion
that the Managing Committee members have committed offences of criminal breach
of trust and falsification of accounts of the Society under Sections 79 and 83
of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act and relevant sections of IPC
and accordingly issued proceedings on 24-10-2002 sanctioning prosecution to
initiate Criminal Proceedings against the petitioners and four others. A
reading of the contents of enquiry report and the note of the Vigilance &
Enforcement Department, Govt. of A.P. discloses serious irregularities
requiring investigation and the truth or otherwise cannot be decided at
threshold and the investigation cannot be stalled. The investigation is held
up for the last 12 years and it is expedient to complete the investigation as
early as possible and complete the same in public interest. In view of the
ratio of the above decisions, the Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed and
is accordingly dismissed.
44\. W.P.4687 of 2010 is a case of repeated complaints against the accused on
the basis of same allegations and this is evident from perusal of C.C.No.776
of 2007 which ended in acquittal on 25.08.2008 and C.C.No.335 of 2008 which
was dismissed on 24.02.2009. The complainant did not disclose the past
complaints in the subsequent complaints but repeated the same accusations.
This is nothing but abuse of process of law. Accordingly C.C.No.285 of 2009 on
the file of the Judicial Magistrate of Second Class at Karimnagar is quashed
and the Writ Petition is allowed.
45\. W.P.8096 of 2010 relates to a complaint lodged by one of the partners
alleging certain irregular transactions in relation to a partnership property
by some partners when a suit for dissolution of partnership and for rendition
of accounts in O.S.No446 of 2005 is pending on the file of the learned I
Additional Senior Civil Judge, Nellore. The allegation is that even after
dissolution of the firm in 1991, some partners sold the firm property in
favour of third parties based on a General Power of Attorney executed on
25.03.1985. The complaint was given to the Additional Director General of
Police, C.I.D., Hyderabad, who obtained a legal opinion on 05.03.2010. The
opinion states that it is a civil dispute and liability of a person can be
both civil and criminal at the same time. However it was opined that a case
can be registered under Section 430 IPC r/w. Section 34 IPC. All the alleged
transactions took place in 2005 and the transaction other than those mentioned
in the complaint already formed part of Annexure 1 and 1A of the plaint filed
in the suit. There is no explanation for lodging a complaint after 5 years and
before the Additional Director General of Police, C.I.D., Hyderabad, except
stating that the accused are influential persons at Nellore. No complaint was
lodged with the local police and in spite of the same it was alleged that they
are not inclined to take appropriate action. The complainant, being a partner
could have obtained appropriate relief in the pending suit. The filing of a
criminal complaint in respect of civil transactions undertaken by the members
of the firm is nothing but an abuse of process of law and malafide as held by
the Full Bench of Calcutta High Court in Bhuban Mohan Dass case (supra),
Supreme Court in Suneet Guptas case (supra) and B.Suresh Yadavs case (supra)
and of this Court in Vankina Chamundeswaranaths case (supra). Accordingly the
Writ Petition is allowed quashing the complaint in FIR No.66 of 2010 dated
14.03.2010 on the file of the Nellore IV Town Police Station.
46\. In W.P.8786 of 2010, the allegation in the complaint is that the accused
cheated the complainant and misrepresented the facts to the Honble Junior
Civil Judge, Yellareddy through the counter affidavit filed on 04.12.2009 in
E.P.1 of 2009. In Gopala Krishna Menon v. D.Raja Reddy , it was held that the
prosecution on the basis of a private complaint in the absence of a complaint
from the appropriate civil court where the alleged fraudulent receipt was
produced would not be sustainable. In view of the same, the Writ Petition is
liable to be allowed and is accordingly allowed quashing FIR No.29 of 2010
dated 13.04.2010 on the file of the Yellareddy Police Station.
47\. W.P.17623 of 2010 was filed challenging the charge sheet in C.C.No.605 of
2009 on the file of the XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and
Special Court for Trial of Video Piracy Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad, on the
ground that the accused cannot be tried for the offence under the provisions
of Copy Right Act in the absence of registration of Copy Right and in any
event, the accused not being the publisher is not liable. These issues have to
be decided after trial in the case. Prima facie, the absence of particulars on
the video film as mandated under Section 52A itself is an infringement of
copyright as held by the Supreme Court in Nagoti Venkataramanas case (supra)
and hence it cannot be held that the petitioner has not violated the law.
Hence the Charge Sheet filed in the case cannot be quashed. Consequently, the
Writ Petition is dismissed.
48\. The miscellaneous petitions pending in these Writ Petitions, if any,
shall stand closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
