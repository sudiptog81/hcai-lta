sureties, for being sold under its appropriate name or, where the magistrate

order it to be forfeited to the Central Government, the State Government or
the local authority, as the case may be.]
(6) 49 [If it appears to the magistrate that any such—
(a) article of food is not adulterated; or
(b) adulterant which is purported to be an adulterant is not an adulterant,
the person from whose possession the article of food or adulterant was taken]
shall be entitled to have it restored to him and it shall be in the discretion

by him or that the purchaser having purchased any article for analysis was not
prejudiced by the sale.
