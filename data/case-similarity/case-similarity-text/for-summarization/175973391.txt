accused Aakash Gupta and read out to him to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed FIR no.437/08 State vs. Aakash Gupta Page2 of 13 trial on 20.01.2012.

cosmetics and household items'. The above said company is having the copy
right and trade mark of the products manufactured by it. They were receiving
information through their trade informer that some unscrupulous persons are
stocking/ selling their products without having any authorization. On the
basis of this information, he had moved the complaint before DCP, East
District which was forwarded to DIU for necessary action. Thereafter he met
with Inspector Sarabjeet Singh Minas, DIU East. On 15.10.2008 he alongwith

some other police officials had left the DIU office at about 4.30 pm in a
private vehicle. On the way, Inspector had asked few public persons to join
the raid but none agreed.

persons u/s 313 Cr. PC was initially recorded on 05.01.2019 wherein the entire
incriminating evidence produced on record was put to him. He denied all the
allegations and stated that they had been falsely implicated in this case.
DEFENCE EVIDENCE OF ACCUSED 17 Accused did not examine any witness in his
defence despite opportunity.
18 Final argument have been heard. Record carefully perused.
Judicial Resolutions 19 It is a settled proposition of criminal law that
prosecution is supposed to prove its case on the judicial file by leading
cogent, convincing reliable and trustworthy evidence beyond reasonable doubts.
The case of prosecution has to fall or stand on its own legs and it cannot
drive any benefit from the weakness if any, in the defence of the accused. It
is not for the accused to disprove the case of the prosecution and onus to
prove the case against FIR no.437/08 State vs. Aakash Gupta Page8 of 13 the
accused beyond reasonable doubts never shifts and it always remains on the
prosecution. Further, benefit of doubt in the prosecution story always goes to
the accused and it entitles the accused to acquittal.
20 In the present case before the accused can be convicted for offence u/s 63
CR Act, the prosecution was required to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that
the alleged recovery of fake products of M/s HUL Ltd. had been effected from
the possession of the accused.
21 As per the case of the prosecution, the investigation of the present case
had started on the basis of a complaint made by the authorised representative
of The Protector, IPR Professionals which is proved by complainant as Ex. PW
2/A. The person authorising complainant on behalf of The Protector is examined
as PW 4. However, the complaint has been made for violation of Copyrights of
products of Hindustan Uniliver Ltd. The documents/ authority authorising The
Protector to initiate action against the persons violating the copyright of
M/s HUL have however not been duly proved on record. The copy of authority
letter in this regard is on record which is Mark A. however, neither the
complainant PW 2, nor Sh. Suresh Sati / PW 4 nor the witness examined on
behalf of M/s HUL Sh. Sanaulla Khan/ PW 8 could produce the original of the
said documents or any other record to prove the authorisation in this regard
being given to The Protector on behalf of M/s HUL. In these circumstances, it
is not duly proved on record that the FIR no.437/08 State vs. Aakash Gupta
Page9 of 13 complainant / PW 2 being the authorised representative of the
Protector was authorised on behalf of M/s HUL for initiating action for
violation of Copyrights of M/s HUL. Similarly, the original copyright
certificates in favor of M/s HUL regarding the allegedly recovered fake
articles i.e. Fair and Lovely, Dove, Ponds and Clinic Plus have not been duly
proved on record. Only the photocopies of the Copyright Certificates and
Assignment Deeds have been placed on record. However, despite repeated
opportunities neither the complainant nor PW 4 or PW 8 could produce the
originals of the said documents. Even the record has not been summoned from
Copyright Office in case the said copyrights were registered. Accordingly,
prosecution has also failed to prove that M/s HUL was having any copyrights in
any of the alleged recovered products which have been violated by the accused.
22 In addition, prosecution has examined in all four witnesses to prove the
recovery proceedings, that are PW 2 / complainant, PW 3, PW 5 and PW 6.
23 There are various contradictions in the testimonies of these recovery
witnesses. While as per PW 2, PW 5 and PW 6 the recovery was effected on
15.10.2008, as per the testimony of PW 3, the recovery was effected on
16.10.2008. PW 3,5, and 6 are police witnesses who deposed that they had
conducted the raid at property no.B-21 Ground Floor at the instance of the
complainant. However, the complainant has not deposed about him being in
knowledge of the fact that fake products were being FIR no.437/08 State vs.
Aakash Gupta Page10 of 13 stored/ sold at property no.B-21. Even his complaint
Ex. PW 2/A does not mention the address of B-21. Moreover as per the testimony
of PW 2 they had gone to the spot in two vehicles, both of which were private
taxis, one was Innova Car and other was Tavera. Both the private Taxis were
arranged by PW 4. However, PW 4 has not deposed anything about the same and as
per the testimony of PW 3, PW 5 and PW 6 they had gone to the spot only in a
single private vehicle. It is also interesting to note that as per testimony
of PW 2 in addition to him and the police officials, other officials from The
Protector namely RB Pathak, Abhishek Choudhary and Suresh Sati/ PW 4 had also
accompanied them during the raid. However, as per the testimony of PW 3,5, and
6, no other public witness except for the complainant was involved in the
recovery/ raid proceedings. Even PW 4 has not deposed about his presence
during the raid. These contradictions clearly create a doubt as regards the
recovery proceedings. Moreover, no independent public witness or neighbour has
been involved in the recovery proceedings for the reasons best known to the
IO. No document has been placed or proved on record to show that the property
from which recovery was effected i.e. B-21, ground floor, Radhey Puri, Krishna
Nagar, Delhi was actually in possession of the accused. 24 All these
contradictions create a doubt on the recovery proceedings which are already
coloured with doubt due to non- involvement of independent public witnesses.
25 Moreover, as per the testimony of recovery witnesses, the FIR no.437/08
State vs. Aakash Gupta Page11 of 13 entire recovered case property was sealed
with the seal of SSM. However, when the case property was produced before the
court during the examination of PW 2, it was in an unsealed condition. No
explanation has come on record regarding the same. The production of the case
property in an unsealed condition clearly creates a doubt regarding the
authenticity of the recovered case property and its manipulation cannot be
ruled out.
26 In addition to this, as per the testimony of PW 2, he was carrying the
original products with him during raid and had stated after comparing the
recovered products with the original products that the recovered products were
fake / spurious. There is no evidence on record from any government lab to
prove that the recovered products were fake/ spurious as stated by the
complainant. No experience certificate has been proved on record to show that
complainant was experienced or trained to identify the fake products from the
original ones. Moreover, as per testimony of PW 2 he had handed over the
original products to IO on the same day but as per the testimony of IO/ PW 6
the original products were handed over and seized by him on the next day of
the raid. All these contradictions create a doubt on the case of the
prosecution, the benefit of which has to be given to the accused.
27 In these circumstances, considering the overall evidence on record and
reasons given above, I have no hesitation in holding that the prosecution has
miserably failed to prove the offences FIR no.437/08 State vs. Aakash Gupta
Page12 of 13 charged against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt. The
evidence brought on record is highly insufficient to give a finding of guilt
against the accused. Accused Aakash Gupta accordingly, deserves acquittal for
offences charged giving him the benefit of doubt.
28 In view of the reasons given above, accused Aakash Gupta is acquitted for
offences u/s 63 Copy Right Act as charged against him.
