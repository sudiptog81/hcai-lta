Mr. Sayan Roy Chowdhury, Advocate Mr. Arunabha Deb, Advocate Ms. Ashika Daga,

business in the city of Kolkata.
21\. In view of the discussions above, there will be an order in terms of

along with the suit.

Mr. Sayan Roy Chowdhury, Advocate Mr. Arunabha Deb, Advocate Ms. Ashika Daga,
Advocate Ms. Arti Bhattacharyya, Advocate Hearing concluded on : January 7,
2020 Judgment on : January 22, 2020 DEBANGSU BASAK, J. :-
1\. Two applications have been taken up for analogous hearing as they are in
the same suit.
2
2\. In a suit for infringement of copy right and passing off, the plaintiff
has sought interim protection by way of their application being old G.A. No.
1326 of 2019, new G.A. No. 1 of 2019. The defendant has applied for
prosecuting the plaintiffs for giving false evidence in old G.A. No. 2391 of
2019, new G.A. No. 3 of 2019.
3\. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiffs has submitted that,
the first plaintiff commenced catering business under the name and style of
'Ganpati Enterprises' in 1996. The first plaintiff and the defendants entered
into a partnership and carried on business under the name and style of Ganpati
Enterprises. Ganpati Enterprises was into Vegetarian Catering business.
Ganpati Enterprises developed a goodwill and reputation for itself. The first
plaintiff and the defendant formalized their partnership by executing a deed
of partnership on April 1, 2000. The partnership obtained a trade mark of
'Ganpati's' and registered it under registration No. 1451164 in Class 42. The
defendant retired from the partnership. On February 28, 2013 a deed of
retirement was executed by the first plaintiff and the defendant. He has
referred to the deed of retirement and submitted that, the defendant gave up
all rights in the partnership including the right with regard to the
registered trade mark. The first plaintiff thereafter obtained an assignment
of the trade  3 mark and registered the same in his favour. The plaintiff is
therefore entitled to use the trade mark 'Ganpati's' exclusively. He has
submitted that, the first plaintiff is carrying on business through the
instrumentality of the second plaintiff which was incorporated previously. The
plaintiffs are therefore entitled to the exclusive user of the registered
trade mark. The plaintiffs have diversified their business and have registered
labels subsisting in their favour.
4\. Referring to the conduct of the defendant, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for the plaintiffs has submitted that, the defendant applied for
registration of label which were rejected and/or abandoned. The defendant is
carrying on the same business as that of the plaintiffs', that is, the
business of vegetarian catering. He has submitted that, the area of such
business being limited to the city of Kolkata and the plaintiffs having
developed a goodwill and reputation of such business and being entitled to the
exclusive user of the trade mark 'Ganpati's', the defendant is trying to pass
off his products as that of the plaintiffs'. The defendant is guilty of
infringing the registered trade mark of the plaintiff. He has submitted that,
the plaintiffs are entitled to interim protection.  4
5\. In support of the contention that, when there exists a registered trade
mark, the plaintiffs are entitled to interim protection in a case of
infringement of trade mark and of business, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the plaintiffs has relied upon 2019 Volume 80 Patent and Trade Mark Cases
page 124 (Royal Dryfruit Range v. Royal Suvidha), 2010 Volume 3 Calcutta High
Court Notes page 912 (R.R. Proteins and Agro Limited v. Hari Shankar Singhania
& Anr.) and 2018 Volume 18 Supreme Court Cases page 346 (Wockhardt Limited v.
Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited).
6\. Referring to the order refusing to grant ad interim order as prayed for by
the plaintiffs, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiffs has
submitted that, the stand of the defendants at the ad interim stage changed in
the affidavit in opposition filed by the defendants. Therefore, according to
him, there are no impediment for the Court granting interim reliefs as prayed
for.
7\. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the defendant has submitted that the
defendant, although was in partnership with the first plaintiff for some time,
parted ways with the first plaintiff in 2009. Since then, the  5 defendant was
using the name of 'Ganpati's Sanjay' with the plaintiff using the name
'Ganpati's Rajesh' to carry on their respective businesses. According to him,
'Ganpati's Rajesh' and 'Ganpati's Sanjay' are two distinct marks and that,
they are not similar, let alone, being deceptively similar. According to him,
there is no confusion with regard to the two marks used by the first plaintiff
and the defendant respectively. He has drawn the attention of the Court to the
averments contained in the petition of the plaintiffs and submitted that, the
plaintiffs have obtained the registration of 'Ganpati's Rajesh' in 2017.
'Ganpati's' was registered in 2009. He has drawn the attention of the Court to
the registration of the word 'Ganpati's'. He has submitted that, the same was
obtained on March 24, 2009.
8\. Referring to the averments made in the petition that, the plaintiff became
aware of the defendant carrying on business under the name of 'Ganpati's
Sanjay' on March 29, 2019, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the defendant
has submitted that, the same is false. He has drawn the attention of the Court
to the fact that, the defendant was carrying on business since partying of
ways in 2008-2009 at a distance of about two minutes walk from the area where
the plaintiffs have their office. He has submitted that, vegetarian catering
in the city of Kolkata  6 being of limited arena, it is impossible that the
plaintiffs were not aware of the defendant carrying on such business with the
name of 'Ganpati's Sanjay' and 'Ganpati's Saurav'. He has drawn the attention
of the Court to the averments made in the affidavit in opposition as also the
annexures thereto. He has submitted that, there are enough materials for the
Court to arrive at the conclusion that, the marks 'Ganpati's Sanjay' and
'Ganpati's Saurav' were being used over a considerable period of time by the
defendant without any objection by the plaintiffs.
9\. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the defendant has relied upon ILR
2009 Volume VI Delhi page 415 (Goenka Institute of Education & Research v.
Anjani Kumar Goenka & Anr.) in support of his contention that, when, there is
a prior user of a trade mark, injunction is not called for. He has relied upon
1994 Volume 2 Supreme Court Cases page 448 (M/s. Power Control Appliances &
Ors. v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd.) and submitted that, since the plaintiffs
are guilty of acquiescence they are not entitled to any protection. Relying
upon 2016 Volume 6 Maharashtra Law Journal page 249 (Datamatics Global
Services Ltd. v. Royal Datamatics Pvt. Ltd.) learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the defendant has submitted that, since, the defendant was using
'Ganpati's Sanjay' over a considerable  7 period of time, interim injunction
should not be granted. Moreover, he has referred to the order passed by the
Court at the ad interim stage and has submitted that, there is no change of
position for the Court to grant any interim relief to the plaintiffs.
10\. Referring to the application of the defendant seeking prosecution against
the plaintiffs for making false statement, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the defendant submitted that, the plaintiffs have relied upon documents
which are forged. In support of such contention, he has drawn the attention of
the Court to some of the annexures of the petition and submitted that, the
brochure was not carried by the publisher. Since the plaintiffs are guilty of
making a false statements knowing the same to be false, the plaintiffs should
be proceeded against appropriately.
11\. The plaintiffs claim exclusive right over the mark 'Ganpati's'. The fact
that, the plaintiff No. 1 and the defendant were in partnership and were
carrying on vegetarian catering business since 1996 is not disputed. The fact
that, the plaintiff No. 1 and the defendant formalized their partnership by
executing a deed of partnership on April 1, 2000 is also not disputed.
According to the defendant, disputes and differences  8 arose between the
first plaintiff and the defendant in or about 2008. On mutual understanding,
it was decided that the first plaintiff and the defendant will part ways.
According to the defendant, he started carrying on business under the name and
style of 'Om Ganpati Caterers' from 2009 and adopted the trade mark 'Ganpati's
Sanjay'. The fact that a formal deed of retirement was executed between the
first plaintiff and the defendant on February 28, 2013 is accepted. The deed
of retirement stipulates that, the defendant relinquished all his right, title
and interest in respect of the partnership firm which would necessarily
include the trade mark then existing in favour of the partnership firm.
12\. At the ad-interim stage the plaintiff has failed to secure an order of
injunction. By the order dated July 3, 2019 the defendant was directed to keep
and furnish weekly accounts. An appeal was carried from the order refusing to
grant injunction. Such appeal was disposed of on July 29, 2019 without
interfering with the order dated July 3, 2019 and directing that the trial
judge should not be influenced by any of the observation made by the Appeal
Court. Directions for completion of affidavits were given and the injunction
petition was directed to be heard on affidavits.
9
13\. One of the defences of the defendant is that the plaintiffs acquiesced in
the defendant in using of the word 'Ganpati's Sanjay'. M/s. Power Control
Appliances & Ors. (supra) has considered the issue of acquiescence. It has
held that, acquiescence is one of the defences available under Section
30(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It has observed that,
acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the rights of the
trademark holder by spending money on it. It is a course of conduct
inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights of the trade mark, trade name
etc. It implies positive acts. Mere silence or inaction or latches do not
constitute acquiescence. There is a distinction between mere negligence and
acquiescence. A plaintiff is guilty of acquiescence when, it stood by
knowingly and let the defendant built up an important trade until it become
necessary to crush it. In such a scenario the plaintiff will be held guilty of
acquiescence and not entitled to relief. Each case has to be assessed so as to
find out whether, the acquiescence in the infringement amounts to consent or
that the acquiescence is such so as to lead to the inference of a licence
sufficient to create a new right in the defendant. In the facts of that case,
the Supreme Court found that, the plaintiff got a trade mark 'Sumeet'
registered in 1964. It was using such trade mark. A Managing Director of  10
the plaintiff incorporated the defendant company and adopted the name
'Sumeet'. The Supreme Court found the plaintiff to have given written consent
to the authority constituted under the Companies Act, 1956 to the
incorporation of the defendant and user of the name 'Sumeet' by the defendant.
The Supreme Court found that, the defendant was engaged in the distribution of
its products through a common distributor as that of the plaintiff and that,
the accounts of the plaintiff and the defendant were audited by the same
auditor. So far as manufacturing the equipments were concerned, the Supreme
Court did not find that, the defendant was actually manufacturing the
equipments before September 1991\. The Supreme Court did not find anything to
establish that the defendant was manufacturing earlier than the alleged
violation of the trade mark. The Supreme Court therefore granted an order of
injunction pending the decision in the suit.
14\. In the facts of the present case, assuming that the plaintiffs acquiesced
in the defendant using the trade mark 'Ganpati's Sanjay' for the period from
2009, then, by the act of the defendant giving up his right to use the word
'Ganpati's' when the defendant executed the deed of retirement on February 28,
2013, the defendant became no longer entitled to use the word 'Ganpati's
Sanjay' or 'Om Ganpati Caterers' or  11 words deceptively similar to the word
'Ganpati's'. There is nothing on record to establish, at least at the prima
facie level that, the plaintiffs acquiesced in the defendant using the word
'Ganpati's Sanjay' or 'Om Ganpati Caterers' since 2008 or subsequently from
the date of execution of the deed of partnership. Mere user of the word by the
defendant will not be sufficient. The defendant has to establish acquiescence
when it is setting up such a defence. On the materials made available to Court
at this interim stage, it is not possible to arrive at such finding in favour
of the defendant.
15\. One of the other defences of the defendant is that, the word 'Ganpati's'
is generic and descriptive in nature. It cannot be said to contain any
distinction. In any event, the defendant was using the mark 'Ganpati's' with
the word 'Sanjay' so as to distinguish between 'Ganpati Caterers' of the
branch continued by the plaintiffs and the branch that is being continued with
the defendant.
16\. This defence of the defendant has to be considered in the context that
the first plaintiff and the defendant were carrying on business in partnership
and using the trademark 'Ganpati's'. The defendant gave up  12 the right to
use such mark on his retirement. The moment the defendant claims that, he is
using a suffix or a prefix to the original mark 'Ganpati's' so as to
distinguish the two branches, the defendant acknowledges that there is an
element of distinction in the parent mark. He acknowledges that something has
to be added to the original mark as a suffix or a prefix so as to distinguish
the new entity. In the facts of the present case, the suffix used by the
defendant cannot be said to be sufficient to create a distinction in
comparison to the original mark. The suffix is added to the original mark
'Ganpati's' which is registered with the plaintiff. Attempts by the defendant
to obtain registration of the label 'Ganpati's Sanjay' failed. At this stage
therefore, it can be safely said that, the mark 'Ganpati's Sanjay' is
deceptively similar to the mark 'Ganpati's' for the defendant to use it
without the permission of the plaintiffs.
17\. In Royal Dryfruit Range (supra), the Bombay High Court in the facts of
that case has found the defendant to be using deceptively similar word as that
of the registered mark and granted an order of injunction. In R.R. Proteins
and Agro Limited (supra) the Court has held that, in a rolled up action for
infringement and passing off, the Court has to test the offending mark on the
pedestal of the perspective of a consumer. It  13 has to assess whether a
projection, as to whether the mark complained of, is likely to deceive or
cause confusion. It has to be assessed through the eyes and ears of the
prospective user of the goods or services. The Judge has to place himself in
the position of a prospective customer and assess whether he would then be
likely to be deceived or confused. If, in addition, there is dishonest intent
on the part of the owner of the mark complained of, it makes it easier for the
claimant in the action to get his protection. It is not necessary that must be
established to obtain a protection by the plaintiff.
18\. Applying such test, since both the parties claim to be in the same
vegetarian catering business, and since the manner in which both the parties
used the word 'Ganpati's' with the additional word 'Ganpati's Rajesh' and
'Ganpati's Sanjay', a prospective customer is likely to be confused as to
whether, 'Ganpati's Sanjay' belongs to the same group as that of 'Ganpati's'
or 'Ganpati's Rajesh' or not. Since the word 'Ganpati's Sanjay' has the
ability to create a confusion in the impression of a prospective customer in
the manner as noted above, in my view, the plaintiffs have made out a case for
grant of injunction pending the disposal of the suit. The Supreme Court in
Wockhardt Limited (supra) has held that, although a passing off action in
essence is based on  14 deceit, fraud is not a necessary element of a right of
action, and that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the
existence of a cause of action for passing off, if otherwise the defendant has
imitated or adopted the plaintiff's mark.
19\. Goenka Institute of Education & Research (supra) is a case of prior user.
The Court in the facts of that case having found the defendant to be a prior
user did not grant injunction as prayed for by the plaintiff. In the facts of
the present case, the defendant has not been able to establish that it is
prior user than the plaintiffs. At best, the first plaintiff and the defendant
were in partnership when, the trade mark 'Ganpati's' was registered. The
defendant however gave up his right in respect of such trade mark when he
executed the deed of retirement on February 28, 2013. Subsequent to the date
of the execution of the deed of retirement dated February 28, 2013, the
defendant cannot claim any valid right in respect of such trade mark. In the
facts of the present case, the defendant cannot be held to be a prior or a
concurrent bona fide user.
15
20\. In Datamatics Global Services Ltd. (supra), the Court has found that
there were other users of the word 'Datamatics' and therefore did not grant
injunction at the interim stage in favour of the plaintiff. In the facts of
the present case, the defendant has not established that there are other users
of the word 'Ganpati's Rajesh' or 'Ganpati's' in the vegetarian catering
business in the city of Kolkata.
21\. In view of the discussions above, there will be an order in terms of
prayers (b) to (e) of old G.A. No. 1326 of 2019, new G.A. No. 1 of 2019, C.S.
No. 101 of 2019 without any order as to costs.
22\. An application for perjury is ideally disposed of and decided at the
conclusion of the suit. In the present case, the defendant alleges that, the
plaintiffs relied upon documents which are false and false to the knowledge of
the plaintiffs. It would be appropriate to postpone the decision on the issue
of perjury as raised in the application for perjury till all the issues of the
suit, as settled, finally decided upon. Let old G.A. No. 2391 of 2019 be heard
along with the suit.

defendant retired from the partnership. On February 28, 2013 a deed of
retirement was executed by the first plaintiff and the defendant. He has
referred to the deed of retirement and submitted that, the defendant gave up
all rights in the partnership including the right with regard to the

instrumentality of the second plaintiff which was incorporated previously. The
plaintiffs are therefore entitled to the exclusive user of the registered
trade mark. The plaintiffs have diversified their business and have registered

of the word 'Ganpati's Rajesh' or 'Ganpati's' in the vegetarian catering
business in the city of Kolkata.
