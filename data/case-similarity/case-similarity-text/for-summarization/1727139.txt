notice to indicate the sources of his income, earnings or assets, out of which
or by means of which he has acquired such property, the evidence on which he

before it and after giving to the person affected (and in a case where the
person affected holds any property specified in the notice through any other
person, to such other person also) a reasonable opportunity of being heard, by
order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are
illegally acquired properties: Provided that if the person affected (and in a

referred to in the show cause notice are illegally acquired properties but is

for the competent authority to specify the properties which, to the best of
its judgment, are illegally acquired properties and record a finding
accordingly under sub-section (1).

equal to the market value of such part.

Explanation.For the purposes of this section illegally acquired property, in relation to any property held in trust, includes
(i) any property which if it had continued to be held by the author of the
trust or the contributor of such property to the trust would have been
