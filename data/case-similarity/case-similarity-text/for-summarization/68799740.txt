         ORAL JUDGMENT
         1.      By this judgment, I propose to dispose of the preliminary
         issue of jurisdiction under Section 9A of the Code of Civil
         Procedure, 1908 ("CPC") raised by the Defendants in both suits.
         2.      In Suit No. 632 of 2014, the preliminary issue was framed on
         31st March 2016. Shortly stated the Defendants' case is that while
         the Plaintiffs have their registered office in Mumbai, they also have a
         branch office in Delhi, where the Defendants have their place of
         business and where, according to the Defendants, the cause of

         action has arisen. Therefore, according to Mr. Kirpekar for the
         Defendants in this Suit, this Court would not have jurisdiction. Only
         the courts in Delhi would.
         3.      The Defendants in Suit No. 516 of 2013 take a substantially
         similar plea. There, the Plaintiff has its registered office in Mumbai.
         The Defendants are based in Kolhapur and they allege that the
         Plaintiffs also have office in Kolhapur, and that the situs of the suit
         should, therefore, be Kolhapur.
         4.      I have heard Dr. Saraf for the Defendants in Suit No. 516 of
         2013, Mr. Kirpekar for the Defendants in Suit No. 632 of 2014, Mr.
         Kadam for the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 516 of 2013 and Mr. Kane for
         the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 632 of 2014 at some length.
         5.      Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar base their submissions on a
         reading of the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing
         Rights Society Limited v Sanjay Dalia & Another.1 To put it in a
         nutshell, the Defendants' case before me is this: Neither Dr. Saraf
         nor Mr. Kirpekar dispute that the Plaintiffs can file a Suit under the
         Trade Marks Act, 1999 or under the Copyright Act, 1957 within the
         local limits of the jurisdiction of the District Court where the
         Plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or
         works for gain. What they suggest, however, is that this right is
         curtailed by the decision of the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia at
         least to this extent: that where such a Plaintiff also has a office at
         another location and the cause of action has arisen in that other

         location, then the Plaintiff cannot file the Suit at the place where it
         has its principal office or registered office, but must file it within the
         jurisdiction of the court where both the subsidiary or branch office
         and the cause of action are to be found.
         6.      Almost the entirety of the discussion before me has been on a
         reading of Sanjay Dalia's case. Before proceeding to a consideration
         of the rival submissions on that decision, it is perhaps more
         appropriate to set out my understanding of the pre- and post-Sanjay
         Dalia jurisdictional regimes. Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act,
         1999 ("TMA 1999") parallels Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act,
         1957 ("CA 1957"). Both depart from the usual jurisdictional
         provision we find in Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
         ("CPC"). Under the CPC, a suit must be brought (a) where all the
         defendants reside or work; or (b) where any of several defendants
         live or reside provided there is either prior leave or the others
         acquiesce in the jurisdiction; or (c) where the cause of action arises
         wholly or in part. Sections 134(2) and 62(2), on the other hand, do
         not have any such requirement. They simply say that a suit in
         infringement or passing off can be brought where the plaintiff
         resides or works. In the case of a corporate, this could be where it
         has its office or offices. In the pre-Sanjay Dalia era, this often
         resulted in much mischief: a corporate would have several satellite
         offices scattered around the country. Using these provisions, it
         would bring infringement and passing off suits in the courts in
         whose jurisdiction those satellite or field offices were located, even
         though the defendants were not there and no cause of action arose
         there. This was precisely the mischief the Sanjay Dalia court
         addressed. It did so not in the manner the Defendants suggest today,

         i.e., by a wholesale rewriting of Sections 134(2) and 62(2), for that
         could never have been the Supreme Court's intention or purpose.
         There is also no indication, as we shall see, of any kind of 'reading
         down' or 'imputing in' to the words of intellectual property statutes.
         To the contrary: the Sanjay Dalia decision closely interwove the
         special provisions of those two statutes with the regular
         jurisdictional provisions in the CPC, retaining the integrity and
         structure of each. Keeping in mind that the discussion (and the
         preceding discord) is largely about corporate Plaintiffs, what
         emerges, in my view, is this:
                 (a)
                          A Plaintiff can always file a suit in a court within the
                          local jurisdiction of which its registered office or
                          principal office is located. This is a 'pure' Section
                          134(2) or Section 62(2) invocation of jurisdiction. The
                          location of the defendants and the place of accrual of
                          the cause of action is inconsequential. Sections 134(2)

                          or the situs of the defendants' location at all.
                 (b)      Where a Plaintiff also has a satellite or field office
                          elsewhere, it may bring suit in a court in that location,
                          but this is no longer a Section 134(2) or Section 62(2)
                          jurisdictional invocation. The jurisdiction is governed
                          by Section 20 of the CPC; and hence, one of the
                          defendants must be found there; or leave must be
                          obtained there if some of the defendants are within that
                          jurisdiction and some outside it; or it must be shown
                          that the cause of action has arisen, wholly or in part, in

                          that jurisdiction. This option does not oust or limit the
                          plaintiff's right to move under Section 134(2) or
                          Section 62(2).
                 (c)      A plaintiff can always travel to where the defendant is
                          located2 or where the cause of action arises and bring
                          suit there. This again is purely a Section 20 CPC
                          invocation of jurisdiction. It has nothing at all to do
                          with Section 134(2) or Section 62(2). The plaintiff
                          need not have any office in that location.
         7.
                 From this, it will be seen that the first 'route' -- the one I
         describe as 'pure' Section 134(2) or 62(2) -- is untouched by the
         others; and the others are only relatable to Section 20, not to the
         special provisions in the two intellectual property statutes.
         8.      At the cost of repetition, what was the mischief that was
         addressed in Sanjay Dalia? It was this: Section 134(2) of the TMA
         1999 and Section 62(2) of the CA 1957 borrow the defendant-
         specific phraseology of Section 20(a) and (b) of the CPC but apply it
         to a plaintiff. The difficulty then arises with the phrase 'carries on
         business', especially as applied to a corporate plaintiff. Corporates
         have branch, field or satellite offices throughout the country. Only
         one of them is the registered or principal place of business. If the
         two special intellectual property statutes are read broadly, it would
         mean that a plaintiff can file a suit in any remote location because it
         2       Or where one of several defendants is located, with leave, or if they have
                 acquiesced.

         'carries on business' there. That, the Sanjay Dalia court said, was
         never the legislative intent. True, an infringer should know the risk
         he runs, viz., that he will be forced to go to where the plaintiff is, but
         this should be read to mean the jurisdictional location of plaintiff's
         registered office or principal place of business, not its far-flung
         satellite office. But this does not and cannot mean that the
         plaintiff's right to bring suit in the jurisdiction of its registered office
         or principal place of business is in any way curtailed or fettered.
         9.      I turn now to the statutory provisions. Section 20 of the Code
         of Civil Procedure, 1908 reads thus:
                 "20. Other suits to be instituted where Defendants
                 reside or cause of action arises.-- Subject to the
                 limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a

                                   and voluntarily resides, or carries on
                                   business, or personally works for gain; or
                          (b)      any of the Defendants, where there are
                                   more than one, at the time of the

                                   is given, or the Defendants who do not

         12.     First as to a plain reading Sections 134(2) and 62(2). These
         sections have, to begin with, a non obstante clause that refers to the
         CPC. However, the important word in those sections is "include".
         This suggests that the jurisdictional benefit of Sections 134(2) and
         62(2) is not exclusive or exclusionary. It is an additional benefit or an
         additional provision, and, as we shall see, this is precisely the finding
         of the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia.
         13.     As I have noted, Section 20 of the CPC deals with the
         'ordinary' jurisdictional situs. There is then the explanation to
         Section 20(c). This is a very interesting explanation. It tells us that
         when it comes to defendant companies, these are deemed to 'carry
         on business' at their sole or principal office in India; or if they have a
         subordinate office where the cause of action, then in that place. The
         important thing about this explanation is that it relates to defendant
         corporations, not plaintiffs.
         14.     Both Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar suggest that the law under
         Section 134(2) of the TMA 1999 and Section 62(2) of the CA 1957
         was 'changed' by the Supreme Court in Sanjay Dalia. Referring to
         the 'mischief' I have described above -- dishonest plaintiffs
         bringing suit in remote locations where there was neither defendant
         nor cause of action -- they say that it was to prevent this abuse that
         the Supreme Court interpreted Sections 134(2) and 62(2) as it did.
         According to them, a plaintiff can no longer file a suit in the District
         Court within the jurisdiction of which the plaintiff has its registered
         or principal office, if the plaintiff also has another (satellite) office at
         another location, and which is the situs of either the defendant or
         the cause of action (or both). In short, their submission is that no

         plaintiff can bring suit under section 134(2) or 62(2) at the place
         where it has its cause of action with nothing further. That privilege
         is now constrained. If it is shown that the plaintiff has another office
         where the defendant carries or business or resides, or where the
         cause of action has arisen, then the plaintiff must file the suit in that
         other location; the Section 134(2) and 62(2) routes are shut to such
         a plaintiff.
         15.     Both Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar rely extensively on the
         Supreme Court's decision in Sanjay Dalia in support of this
         proposition. They have also referred to the two decisions of the
         Delhi High Court, one of a learned Single Judge and the second of a
         Division Bench in Appeal. I will consider both these decisions
         presently.
         16.     It is necessary, I think, to first understand the circumstances
         in which the Supreme Court was required to decide the Sanjay
         Dalia's case. The Supreme Court had before it two matters. The
         first, Civil Appeal Nos. 10643-10644 of 2010, arose from suits filed
         by the Indian Performing Rights Society Limited ("IPRS") to
         prevent copyright infringement by Sanjay Dalia, i.e., to restrain him
         from using the copyright work without license. Mr. Sanjay Dalia
         owned (or owns) cinema halls in Maharashtra and Mumbai where
         infringement was alleged. The entire cause of action arose in
         Mumbai. Yet IPRS brought suits in Delhi where it also happened to
         have an office. The second matter before the Supreme Court, Civil
         Suit FAO (OS) No. 359 of 2007 was filed in the Delhi High Court
         on the basis that the Plaintiff in that suit had a branch office in
         Delhi. The Plaintiff's head office, however, was in Mumbai and the
                                            Page 13 of 34

         Defendant objected to jurisdiction being exercised by the Delhi High
         Court, saying that the suit should have been filed in the Mumbai
         High Court. The third matter appears to have been Civil Appeal
         arising out of SLP (C) No. 8253 of 2013 for trade mark
         infringement. The Plaintiff, a corporate proprietor of the magazine
         "Vogue India" has its registered office in Mumbai, where the
         magazine was processed and published. The Plaintiff also had a
         branch office in Delhi and on that basis sought to file the suit within
         the jurisdiction of that Court.
         17.     This was the factual conspectus before the Supreme Court.
         The rival contentions on behalf of the Appellants are set out in
         paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the SCC report. On behalf of the
         respondents, it was submitted inter alia that the mischief rule of
Heydon's case3 ought to be invoked to prevent harassment of the defendants and
abuse of statutory provisions, i.e., forcing them to travel to distant
locations where absolutely nothing had happened only because the Plaintiff had
a satellite or branch office there. After setting out the necessary statutory
provisions, the Supreme Court also had occasion to note certain portions of
the Parliamentary Debates on the Copyright Act, 1957. These are debates of the
Copyright Committee. They are most instructive. Paragraph 13 of the SCC report
reads:
> "13. The following portion of the Parliamentary Debates as to the Copyright

917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC within whose limit the plaintiff actually
and voluntarily resides.
Clearly this is as it must be, for Section 20 does not contemplate the
location or situs of the plaintiff as a criterion for jurisdiction selection.
Just as Section 20 of the CPC is plaintiff-independent, Sections 134(2) and
62(2) are defendant-independent (and cause of action-independent as well).
Thus, Section 134(2) and 62(2) reverse the ordinary law governing
jurisdiction.
19\. In the cases before the Supreme Court, the entire cause of action had
arisen within the jurisdiction of the court where the principal place of
business of the Plaintiff was situated; yet the Plaintiffs all sought to sue
elsewhere. I find that the portions that Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar highlight
do not support their propositions.
For instance, the last sentence of paragraph 14 and the whole of paragraph 15
relate to corporate defendants (covered by the explanation to Section 20 of
the CPC), and not to plaintiffs in a trade mark or a copyright action at all.

20\. The emphasized portions make it clear that the reference here was to a
corporate defendant, not a corporate plaintiff. If there was any doubt about
what the Supreme Court intended, I imagine it is put to rest by paragraph 18:

21\. Now this paragraph shows that there were four distinct scenarios.
(a) The first portion is in the words "it is clear that if a cause of action
has arisen wholly or in part where the Plaintiff is residing or having its
principal office/carries on business or personally works for gain, the suit
can be filed at such place/s". This is a pure Section 20(c) jurisdictional
choice. It also says can, not must. There is the element of choice.
(b) That choice finds recognition in the second portion, with the words
"Plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a place where he is residing,
carrying on business or personally works for gain de hors the fact that the
cause of action has not arisen at a place where he/they are residing or any
one of them is residing, carries on business or personally works for gain."
This is a reference to a pure Section 134(2) or 62(2)  Page 18 of 34 15th June
2016  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016 05:25:11 :::
Manugraph India Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC jurisdictional choice of forum --
entirely de hors the cause of action or the situs of the defendant.
(c) The third portion deals with the mischief that faced the Supreme Court:
"Plaintiff is residing or carrying on business at a particular place/having
its head office and at such place cause of action has also arisen wholly or in
part, Plaintiff cannot ignore such a place under the guise that he is carrying
on business at other far flung places also." This was therefore a situation
where the plaintiff had its head office or registered office at a place where
the cause of action also arose but it chose to ignore all that and brought
suit at the situs of a satellite office where nothing at all had happened and
where none of the defendants resided or worked. That, the Supreme Court said,
was not the legislative mandate of Section 62(2) or 134(2).
22\. Dr. Saraf's and Mr. Kirpekar's arguments also overlook the Supreme
Court's finding that "the very intendment of the insertion of provision in the
Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act is the convenience of the Plaintiff", a
matter that is reflected in the Copyright Committee debates. It is therefore
in this background that we must see paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 of Sanjay Dalia.
19\. The intendment of the aforesaid provisions inserted in the Copyright Act
and the Trade Marks Act is to provide a forum to the Plaintiff where he is
residing, carrying on business or personally works for gain. The object is to
ensure that the Plaintiff is not  Page 19 of 34 15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded
on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016 05:25:12 ::: Manugraph India
Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC deterred from instituting infringement
proceedings "because the court in which proceedings are to be instituted is at
a considerable distance from the place of their ordinary residence". The
impediment created to the Plaintiff by section 20 C.P.C. of going to a place
where it was not having ordinary residence or principal place of business was
sought to be removed by virtue of the aforesaid provisions of the Copyright
Act and the Trade Marks Act. Where the Corporation is having ordinary
residence/principal place of business and cause of action has also arisen at
that place, it has to institute a suit at the said place and not at other
places. The provisions of section 62 of the Copyright Act and section 134 of
the Trade Marks Act never intended to operate in the field where the Plaintiff
is having its principal place of business at a particular place and the cause
of action has also arisen at that place so as to enable it to file a suit at a
distant place where its subordinate office is situated though at such place no
cause of action has arisen. Such interpretation would cause great harm and
would be juxtaposed to the very legislative intendment of the provisions so
enacted.
20\. In our opinion, in a case where cause of action has arisen at a place
where the Plaintiff is residing or where there are more than one such persons,
any of them actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or
personally works for gain would oust the jurisdiction of other place where the
cause of action has not arisen though at such a place, by virtue of having
subordinate office, the Plaintiff instituting a suit or other proceedings
might be carrying on business or personally works for gain.

917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC
21\. At the same time, the provisions of section 62 of the Copyright Act and
section 134 of the Trade Marks Act have removed the embargo of suing at place
of accrual of cause of action wholly or in part, with regard to a place where
the Plaintiff or any of them ordinarily resides, carries on business or
personally works for gain. We agree to the aforesaid extent the impediment
imposed under section 20 of the CPC to a Plaintiff to institute a suit in a
court where the Defendant resides or carries on business or where the cause of
action wholly or in part arises, has been removed. But the right is subject to
the rider in case Plaintiff resides or has its principal place of
business/carries on business or personally works for gain at a place where
cause of action has also arisen, suit should be filed at that place not at
other places where Plaintiff is having branch offices etc. (Emphasis added)
23\. Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar read the italicized portions as being a
Supreme Court-mandated curtailing of Sections 134(2) and 62(2). I cannot agree
with this. In paragraph 19, the italicized portion is to be read with the next
sentence, not plucked out in isolation. The sentence "Where the Corporation is
having ordinary residence/principal place of business and cause of action has
also arisen at that place, it has to institute a suit at the said place and
not at other places" is followed by this: "The provisions of section 62 of the
Copyright Act and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act never intended to operate
in the field where the Plaintiff is having its principal place of business at
a particular place and the cause of action has also arisen at that place so as
to enable it to file a suit at a  Page 21 of 34 15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded

Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC distant place where its subordinate
office is situated though at such place no cause of action has arisen."
Reading only the first renders the second entirely otiose. No judgment can or
should be read like this. Similarly, the italicized portion of paragraph 21,
it must be read in context too of what it was the Supreme Court was
addressing. "in case Plaintiff resides or has its principal place of
business/carries on business or personally works for gain at a place where
cause of action has also arisen, suit should be filed at that place not at
other places where Plaintiff is having branch offices etc." only means that no
suit can be filed at a site office, one that is not the registered or
principal office, and at the location of which there is neither defendant nor
cause of action. That, the Supreme Court said, is an abuse of the provision.
24\. Mr. Kadam and Mr. Kane are, for their part, correct in also pointing out
that the interpretation canvassed by Dr. Saraf and Mr. Kirpekar introduces
multiple ambiguities where there are none. For instance, paragraph 23 says in
terms that the judgments in appeal did not take away the additional forum and
fundamental basis of conferring the right and advantage provided by Sections
62(2) and 134(2).
25\. Then come paragraphs 25 and 26 and these, to my mind, put the matter
beyond all doubt.
25\. Considering the first aspect of aforesaid principle, the common law which
was existing before the provisions of law were passed was section 20 of the
CPC. It did not provide for the Plaintiff to institute a suit except in
accordance with the provisions contained  Page 22 of 34 15th June 2016  :::
Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016 05:25:12 ::: Manugraph
India Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC in section 20. The defect in existing law
was inconvenience/deterrence caused to the authors suffering from financial
constraints on account of having to vindicate their intellectual property
rights at a place far away from their residence or the place of their
business. The said mischief or defect in the existing law which did not
provide for the Plaintiff to sue at a place where he ordinarily resides or
carries on business or personally works for gain, was sought to be removed.
Hence, the remedy was provided incorporating the provisions of section 62 of
the Copyright Act. The provisions enabled the Plaintiff or any of them to file
a suit at the aforesaid places. But if they were residing or carrying on
business or personally worked for gain already at such place, where cause of
action has arisen, wholly or in part, the said provisions have not provided
additional remedy to them to file a suit at a different place. The said
provisions never intended to operate in that field. The operation of the
provisions was limited and their objective was clearly to enable the Plaintiff
to file a suit at the place where he is ordinarily residing or carrying on
business etc., as enumerated above, not to go away from such places. The
Legislature has never intended that the Plaintiff should not institute the
suit where he ordinarily resides or at its Head Office or registered office or
where he otherwise carries on business or personally works for gain where the
cause of action too has arisen and should drag the Defendant to a subordinate
office or other place of business which is at a far distant place under the
guise of the fact that the Plaintiff/corporation is carrying on business
through branch or otherwise at such other place also. If such an
interpretation is permitted, as rightly submitted on behalf of the
Respondents, the abuse of  Page 23 of 34 15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded on -
04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016 05:25:12 ::: Manugraph India Ltd v
Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC the provision will take place.
Corporations and big conglomerates etc. might be having several subordinate
offices throughout the country. Interpretation otherwise would permit them to
institute infringement proceedings at a far flung place and at unconnected
place as compared to a place where Plaintiff is carrying on their business,
and at such place, cause of action too has arisen. In the instant cases, the
principal place of business is, admittedly, in Mumbai and the cause of action
has also arisen in Mumbai. Thus, the provisions of section 62 of the Copyright
Act and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act cannot be interpreted in a manner
so as to confer jurisdiction on the Delhi court in the aforesaid circumstances
to entertain such suits. The Delhi court would have no territorial
jurisdiction to entertain it.
26\. The avoidance of counter mischief to the Defendant is also necessary
while giving the remedy to the Plaintiff under the provisions in question. It
was never visualised by the law makers that both the parties would be made to
travel to a distant place in spite of the fact that the Plaintiff has a remedy
of suing at the place where the cause of action has arisen where he is having
head office/carrying on business etc. The provisions of the Copyright Act and
the Trade Marks Act provide for the authors/trade marks holders to sue at
their ordinary residence or where they carry on their business. The said
provisions of law never intended to be oppressive to the Defendant. The
Parliamentary Debate quoted above has to be understood in the manner that suit
can be filed where the Plaintiff ordinarily resides or carries on business or
personally works for gain. Discussion was to provide remedy to Plaintiff at
convenient place; he is not to travel away. Debate was not to enable Plaintiff
Page 24 of 34 15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on -

Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC to take Defendant to farther place,
leaving behind his place of residence/business etc. The right to remedy given
is not unbridled and is subject to the prevention of abuse of the aforesaid
provisions, as discussed above. Parliament never intended that the subject
provisions to be abused by the Plaintiff by instituting suit in wholly
unconnected jurisdiction. In the instant cases, as the principal place of
business is at Mumbai the cause of action is also at Mumbai but still the
place for suing has been chosen at Delhi. There may be a case where Plaintiff
is carrying on the business at Mumbai and cause of action has arisen in
Mumbai. Plaintiff is having branch offices at Kanyakumari and also at Port
Blair, if interpretation suggested by Appellants is acceptable, mischief may
be caused by such Plaintiff to drag a Defendant to Port Blair or Kanyakumari.
The provisions cannot be interpreted in the said manner devoid of the object
of the Act."
26\. The illustration in paragraph 26 entirely sums up the finding.
27\. In addition to this the Supreme Court has specifically noted the impact
of the word "include" in paragraph 40 of the SCC report. It did so while
referencing the decision in Exphar Sa v. Eupharma Laboratories Limited.4 This
decision makes it clear that the introduction of Section 62(2) was not to
place any restriction on copyright owners, but quite reverse, i.e., to remove
any impediments in their way. Any limitations or restrictions in the
jurisdictional powers of the District Court were removed and were expanded to
include in addition suits brought by person/s whose offices were within the
jurisdiction of that Court irrespective of 4 (2004) 3 SCC 688  Page 25 of 34
15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016

917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC whether the defendants were within that
jurisdiction or whether the cause of action arose within that jurisdiction.
28\. This is in fact the basis and substratum of the decision of the Supreme
Court in Sanjay Dalia too. For here, the Supreme Court has emphasized that
these two special statutes provide an additional remedy to the Plaintiff. This
is the only plausible way to reconcile the non obstante clause with the word
"include".
29\. It is also correct that while interpreting or construing a judgment, one
must read it in its factual conspectus and see it as an authority what it
actually decides. There are several consequences to accepting Dr. Saraf and
Mr. Kirpekar's argument, none of them very good. The first of these suggest
that in Sanjay Dalia the Supreme Court engineered a wholesale rewriting of
Sections 134(2) and Section 62(2) by inserting in each of these sections
additional qualifications that we do not find there or requiring the reading
down of these provisions. It did not, and nothing in the decision suggests
that it did or intended to.
30\. The second consequence, one that is possibly even more dramatic, is that
if the Defendants' interpretation is to be accepted, then Sections 134(2) and
62(2), and the special benefits or advantages they confer, now recognized
emphatically by the Supreme Court, are rendered entirely otiose; and every
plaintiff is then left with only a Section 20 CPC route open to him. For, if a
plaintiff cannot bring suit in the situs of its registered office or principal
place of business 'de hors' as the Supreme Court said 'the  Page 26 of 34 15th
June 2016  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016
05:25:12 ::: Manugraph India Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC fact that the cause of action has not
arisen' there, then Sections 134(2) and 62(2) have no meaning. They are not
required. Section 20 of the CPC is sufficient if a plaintiff in a trade mark
or copyright action can only file suit as any other plaintiff could, i.e.,
where the defendants reside or where the cause of action accrues. This
interpretation is not correct. Every plaintiff can always bring a suit where
the cause of action in whole or in part arises or where the defendants reside
or works for gain. No special dispensation was required for this purpose at
all. A plaintiff in a trade mark or copyright action has, however, an
additional option or route available: where he has his registered office, and
this has nothing to do with the defendants' location or that of the cause of
action. This is not fettered in any way by Sanjay Dalia. It matters not how to
put it, whether in the affirmative or the negative as Dr. Saraf does (meaning
that the Plaintiff can bring a suit where his registered office lies unless
the cause of action arises in the jurisdiction where he has a satellite
office).
31\. In my view, all that the Supreme Court did in Sanjay Dalia was to deal
with the patent mischief that was placed before it:
plaintiffs filing suits in remote locations only because they happened to have
branch offices there, although the defendants were to be found in another
location and the plaintiffs themselves had their own offices in those other
locations and the entire cause of action had also arisen in those other
locations.
32\. Sanjay Dalia's case was interpreted by a Single Judge of the Delhi High
Court in Ultra Home Construction Private Limited v.
Page 27 of 34
15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 30/07/2016
05:25:12 ::: Manugraph India Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC Purushottam Kumar Chaubey & Others.5 The
Single Judge of the Delhi High Court held, in essence, that, following Sanjay
Dalia, a plaintiff could no longer bring suits where his principal office was
located if the Plaintiff also have a branch office and the cause of action
arose there. The Single Judge dismissed the Suit on this ground. The Appellate
Court upheld this view but reversed on the limited ground that the plaint
ought to have been returned for presentation to the proper Court. The decision
of the Appellate Court in Ultra Home Construction has been extensively relied
upon by Mr. Kirpekar.6
33\. I am, with regret, unable to accept the interpretation of Sanjay Dalia in
the decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court. I would ordinarily
have been loathe to stray too far from the decision of a Division Bench of
another High Court; but this view seems to me to be plainly incorrect. I
believe the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court was in error, and that
error appears to me to be in the first sentence of paragraph 12 where it said
that the deeming provision of Section 20, i.e., the explanation, had been
'read into' Sections 134(2) and 62(2) (for isolating the place where the
plaintiff can be said to be carrying on business). As we have seen, that was
not the issue before the Supreme Court at all, nor did the Supreme Court read
down the provisions of either of these two sections. If we view the provisions
of Section 20 as a three-tier structure, then the provisions of Section 134(2)
and Section 62(2) 5 227 (2016) DLT 320 6 Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. v
Purushottam Kumar Chaubey & Ors., FAO (OS) 494 of 2015 and CM 17816 of 2015,

917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC must be seen as standing apart. Sanjay
Dalia recognizes just this. It does not disrupt this structure at all. There
is nothing in that judgment to suggest that the provisions of Section 134(2)
or Section 62(2) are in any way curtailed by the provisions of Section 20 of
the CPC.
34\. Mr. Kane draws my attention to the judgment of another learned Single
Judge (Vipin Sanghi J) of the Delhi High Court in RSPL Limited v Mukesh Sharma
& Anr.7 Mr. Justice Sanghi was of the view that the case before him was
unaffected by the Division Bench's decision in Ultra Home, one he came upon
after he reserved judgment in RSPL Ltd. Yet, as a student of law, he set out
his reasons for disagreeing with the view of the Division Bench. Mr. Justice
Sanghi's judgment sets out several passages from Sanjay Dalia and he too
concludes, as have I, that the Supreme Court recognize that an additional
forum had been provided under Section 62(2) and Section 134(2) of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999 by including the District Court within whose limits a
plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or
personally works for gain as a possible place for such a plaintiff to bring a
trade mark or copyright action. In paragraph 22 of his decision, Mr. Justice
Sanghi summarized the position as it emerges from Sanjay Dalia with admirable
precision and concision:
"22. From the aforesaid decision in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited
(supra), and the decision cited by 7 I.A. No. 11034 of 2015 in C.S. (OS) No.

05:25:12 ::: Manugraph India Ltd v Simarq Technologies Pvt Ltd & Ors.
917-NMSL94-13 & 918-NMS1180-14-F.DOC the Supreme Court therein, in my opinion,
the position that emerges is as follows:
(a) By resort to Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act and 62 of the Copyright
Act, the Plaintiff may institute the suit where the Plaintiff voluntarily
resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. In the context of
corporation, which includes a company incorporated under the Indian Companies
Act, 1956, such a place would be the place where the registered office of the
company is situated.
Thus, a company can maintain a suit under Section 134 of the Trade marks Act,
or Section 62 of the Copyright Act, at the place where its registered office
is situated, irrespective of the fact, whether or not, cause of action has
arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court, within whose jurisdiction the
registered office of the company is situated.
(b) Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act and Section 62 of the Copyright Act do
not take away right of the Plaintiff to institute the suit by resort to
Section 20 of the CPC, as Section 134 of the Trade marks Act and Section 62 of
the Copyright Act provide an additional forum to the Plaintiff alleging
infringement of the registered trademark or copyright, as the case may be.
This is clear from the inclusive definition of the expression, 'District Court
having jurisdiction' contained in Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act and
Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act. Thus, the Plaintiff may file a suit for
infringement of trademark/copyright either at the place where the Plaintiff
voluntarily resides or carries on  Page 30 of 34 15th June 2016  ::: Uploaded

resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks
Act, or at the place where, 'the Defendant, or each of the Defendants where
there are more than one, at the time of commencement of the suit, actually and
voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain'.
[Section 20(a)]; or where any of the Defendants, where there are more than
one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily
resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that
in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the Defendants who do
not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid,
acquiesce in such institution [section 20(b)]; or the cause of action wholly
or in part, arises [section 20(c)].
(c) The Plaintiff cannot file a suit alleging infringement of
trademark/copyright at a place where it has a subordinate office, by resort to
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act or Section 62 of the Copyright Act, unless
one of the conditions of Section 20 CPC are satisfied."
35\. I am in most respectful agreement with the views expressed by Mr. Justice
Sanghi. In my view, his reading of Sanjay Dalia is correct on all counts.
36\. What emerges from this discussion is this:
