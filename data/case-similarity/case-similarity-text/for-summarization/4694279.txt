PER SMT BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER:
Present appeal has been filed by assessee against order dated 27/11/18 passed
by Ld.CIT (A)-2, Bangalore for assessment year 2013-14 on following grounds of
appeal:
ITAA No.760(B)/2019  2 General grounds
1\. The order of Honourable Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-2
(hereinafter referred as "CIT(A)" for brevity) to the extent prejudicial to
the Appellant is bad in law and is liable to be quashed.
GROUND RELATING TO DISALLOWANCE OF EXHIBITION CHARGES U/S 40(a)(i):
2\. The learned CIT(A) has erred in conforming the action of Assessing Officer
(`A0') in:
a. disallowing a sum of Rs. 10,64,075/- paid towards exhibition charges to
non-residents for events held outside India on the ground that tax has not
been deducted at source; b. not appreciating the fact that when the impugned
payment towards exhibition charges are not chargeable to tax in India as per
the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 and respective tax treaty, there is no
requirement of deduction of tax at source under section 195(1) of the Act;
c. concluding that the Appellant has failed to make an application before the
AO u/s 195(2) of the Act, without appreciating the fact that there is no such
requirement when the payment is not chargeable to tax in India as per the
provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961 and respective tax treaty; and d.
furnishing or non-furnishing of Form 15CA does noI determine whether the
Appellant is liable to withhold tax. GROUND RELATING TO INTEREST U/S 234B &
U/S 234C:
3\. The CIT(A) and the AO have erred in levying interest under section 234B of
Rs. 2,35,745/- and under section 234C of Rs.1,35,193/- respectively. On the
facts and in the circumstances of the case, interest under section 234B and
234C is excessive. The Appellant denies its liability to pay interest under
section 234B and 234C.
The Appellant submits that each of the above grounds/ sub- grounds are
independent and without prejudice to one another.
The Appellant craves leave to add, alter, vary, omit. substitute or amend the
above grounds of appeal, at any time before or at, the time of hearing, of the
appeal, so as to Enable the ITAT to decide the appeal according to law.
ITAA No.760(B)/2019  3 2 .Brief facts of the case are as under:
Assessee filed its return of income for year under consideration declaring
total income of Rs.89,27,750/- on 29/09/13. Subsequently revised return was
filed on 21/06/14. Notice under section 142(1) was issued in response to which
representative of assessee appeared before Ld.AO and furnished details as
called for. Ld.AO observed that assessee is engaged in manufacturing digital
panel, meters and providing energy management solution. It was observed that
assessee debited sum of Rs.34,27,061/- as sales promotion expenses during the
year. Ld.AO observed that amongst the payments, no TDS was deducted on
Rs.9,13,841/- and Rs.1,50,234/- paid as exhibition charges. Assessee was
called upon to provide explanation as to why these amounts should not be
disallowed under section 40a(ia) of the Act. It was submitted that these
amounts were paid to non-resident towards exhibition charges for which TDS was
not deductible. Ld.AO rejected submissions of assessee and disallowed sum of
Rs.10,64,075/- under section 40a(ia) of the Act.
2.1 Aggrieved by addition made by Ld. AO, assessee preferred appeal before
Ld.CIT(A).
3\. Ld.CIT(A) observed that assessee failed to provide any substantiation
regarding the exact expenditure incurred and parties to whom payment have been
made, any proof of residence and applicability of non-deduction of tax on
these payments. It was ITAA No.760(B)/2019  4 also observed by Ld. CIT (A)
that assessee failed to file Form 15 CA. He thus upheld disallowance made by
Ld. AO.
3.1. Aggrieved by order of Ld. CIT (A) assessee is in appeal before us now.
4\. At the outset Ld.AR submitted that there is delay of 65 days in filing
present appeal before this Tribunal. The reason for delay stated by assessee
is on account of oversight by security personnel who failed to communicate the
order as soon as it was received. In affidavit dated 10/04/19 by Managing
Director. It is submitted that security personnel did not hand over order of
Ld.CIT (A) to accounts department, and it was noticed during annual cleanup of
files where documents were in cabin of security personnel on 25/03/19. Ld.AR
submitted that substantial Justice would be denied in the event delay is not
condoned and appeal is not heard on merits. Placing reliance upon decision of
this Tribunal in case of Wipro Chandrika Pvt.Ltd., in TS-7-ITAT-2019 (Bang.)
Ld.AR submitted that substantial Justice should prevail over technical
considerations. He thus requested for delay to be condoned as it was not
intentional.
4.1 Ld. DR however opposed the application for condonation of delay.
4.2 We observe that contents of affidavit filed by managing director reveals
reason why appeal could not be filed on time. It has been submitted by Ld.AR
that it was neither willful nor intentional to file appeal before this
Tribunal belatedly.
ITAA No.760(B)/2019  5
5\. At the outset, we refer to principles that needs to be kept in mind while
considering application for condonation of delay as emphasised by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case of Collector, Land Acquisition vs Mst. Katiji & Ors.
(1987) 167 ITR 471. Hon'ble Supreme Court emphasised that substantial Justice
should prevail over technical consideration and that a litigant does not stand
to be benefited by lodging the appeal late. Hon'ble Supreme Court also
explained that a pedantic approach should be adopted and the doctrine must be
applied in a rational commonsense and pragmatic manner.
5.1 Keeping in view aforestated principles as laid down by Hon'ble Supreme
Court and having regard to circumstances explained in the affidavit, we
condoned delay in filing of present appeal. 5.2 The only issue raised before
us, is in respect of disallowance made under section 40(A)(ia) of the Act.
It has been submitted that sum of Rs.10,64,075/- was paid exhibition charges
to two nonresidents for event held outside India in South Africa and UAE.
Ld.AR submitted that, payments were made for facilities provided abroad by
nonresidents that is, special pavilion design, enhanced catalogue, Web entry
and customers made rented cubicles on-site and insurance at the exhibition
Centre. He submitted that said payments are in the nature of business profit,
under Article 7 of DTAA between India - South Africa and India - UAE which
provides that the business profit of an enterprise is taxable in contracting
state, only if the enterprise ITAA No.760(B)/2019  6 carries on business
through a permanent establishment situated in that contracting state. Ld.AR
submitted that, the non-resident companies did not have any permanent
establishment in India and therefore, the payments made by assessee towards
exhibition charges to these non-residents would not be taxable in India. He
thus submitted that remittances were towards facilities provided by these non-
resident outside India to assessee and the same was in the nature of business
income of non-resident beneficiary which had no permanent establishment in
India and therefore, obligation to deduct tax do not arise under such
circumstances.
6\. On the contrary Ld. SR.DR placed reliance upon observations of Ld. CIT
(A). It has been submitted by Ld. SR.DR that the moment there is a remittance
the obligation to deduct tax at source arises and it was not permissible for
payer to contend that payment made to nonresidents did not give rise to income
which is taxable in India.
7\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us.
7.1 Ld.AR placed reliance upon decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of GE
India Technology Cen. (P) Ltd vs CIT reported in (2010) 193 Taxmann 234.
Hon'ble Supreme Court had analysed identical issue wherein Hon'ble court
observed that:
"The most important expression in section 195 (1) consists of the words
"chargeable under the provisions of the act". A person paying interest or any
other sum to a non-resident is not liable to deduct tax ITAA No.760(B)/2019  7
if such item is not chargeable to tax under income tax act. For instance,
where there is no obligation on the part of the payer and no right to receive
the sum by the recipient and that the payment does not arise out of any
contract or obligation between the payer and the recipient but is made
voluntarily, such payments cannot be regarded as income under the income tax
act. It may be noted that section 195 contemplates not merely amounts, the
whole of which are pure income payments, it also covers composite payments
which has an element of income embedded or incorporated in them. Thus where an
amount is payable to a non-resident, the payer is under an obligation to
deduct TES in respect of such composite payments. The obligation to deduct TAS
is, however, limited to the appropriate portion of income chargeable under the
act forming part of the gross sum of money payable to the non-resident. The
obligation being limited to the appropriate portion of income flows from the
words used in section 195 (1), namely, "chargeable under the provisions of the
act". It is for this reason that vide circular No. 728 dated 30/10/95 that the
CBDT has clarified that the tax deducted can take into consideration the
effect of DTAA in respect of payment of royalties and technical fees while
deducting TAS."
7.2 In the present facts of the case, it is not at all the issue raised by
Ld.AO that there exist permanent establishment in India of nonresidents to
whom payments have been made by assessee. Therefore we are unable to accept
submissions of Ld. CIT DR that assessee should have deducted tax at source
under section 195 (1) ITAA No.760(B)/2019  8 on the 1st instance itself.
Further, there is nothing bought on record by learned authorities blow which
indicates existence of PE of non-residents to whom payments have been made by
assessee without deducting TAS. Also that revenue could not establish that
sums payable to non-resident are chargeable to tax in India. Respectfully
following the ratio laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of GE India
Technology Cen. (P) Ltd vs CIT (supra), we allow the ground raised by
assessee.
In the result appeal filed by assessee stands allowed. Order pronounced in the
open court on 13-12-2019.
