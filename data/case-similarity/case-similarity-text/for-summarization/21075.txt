     3.          CASE AGAINST THE DEFENDANT AS PER THE
                PLAINTIFF
    (i)         The defendant is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of
alcoholic beverages more specifically beers. The Defendant has been using the
brand PALONE/OKACIM PALONE in relation to its strong beers overseas. The brand
was launched by the defendant in India in the year 2007 but it was not clicked
in the Indian Market. Therefore, the Defendant in Feb, 2011 launched PALONE 8
(alleged to be a super strong beer) in India, numeral 8 being used in a
prominent fashion and in fact as a primary mark.
(ii) The impugned mark/numeral 8 is being used by the Defendant as a primary
mark despite PALONE/OKACIM PALONE, admittedly, being the Defendant's main
brand. The Defendant has also applied for the registration of the PALONE 8
label on 07.02.2011 with the user claim of 23.01.2011. Also, the website of
the parent company of the Defendant www.carlsberggroup.com lists PALONE 8 as
on of its main brands.
(iii) Being in the same trade and being well aware of the reputation of the
Plaintiff's 8 PM/ 8 P.M family of marks, the conduct of the Defendant in
adopting and using the impugned mark/numeral 8 in respect of same goods and
that too in same font and colour with mala fide intention which is also
corroborated by the fact that the Defendant is also using a slogan ―8 KA DUM‖
similar to that of the Plaintiff's well known CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.6 of
81 campaign ―AATH KE THAATH‖. The Defendant is also using the expression
―ROYALS‖ deliberately as ROYALE is part of the of the Plaintiff's ―8 P.M‖
family of marks.
4\. In view of the abovementioned facts, it is alleged that the conduct of the
Defendant is in violation of Plaintiff's statutory and common law rights,
therefore, the Defendant be restrained from using the Numeral 8 in relation to
their products.
5\. DEFENDANT‟S CASE
(a) The defendant states that it is a company incorporated under the Companies
Act, 1956 having its registered office at Delhi. Defendant's parent company,
Carlsberg A/S, Denmark, including its subsidiaries and affiliates is one of
the leading brewery groups in the world including beers and other beverage
brands which are sold in more than 150 countries.
(b) In India they have launched CARLSBERG, TUBORG, OKOCIM PALONE and variants
thereof. In the year 2006, Carlsberg Group decided to enter India and
incorporated South Asia Breweries Private Limited on May 3, 2006. Later on,
the said company changed its name to Carlsberg India Pvt. Limited (Defendant
herein) with effect from February 23, 2009.
(c) By the end of year 2009, Defendant has been using three brand names viz.
CARLSBERG in ‗Super Premium Mild'; TUBORG in CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.7 of
81 ‗Premium Mild'; and OKOCIM PALONE in ‗Premium Strong Beer' (6.5% ABV -
Alcohol by Volume).
(d) The brand OKOCIM PALONE is being used internationally since the year 2005
and in India since the year 2007. OKOCIM PALONE label is registered as a trade
mark in India since the year 2007. Considering that there is a high demand for
strong beer in the Indian market, the Carlsberg Group through Defendant, in
January 2011, launched a stronger variant of its well-established brand OKOCIM
PALONE under PALONE 8 label having Alcohol By Volume (ABV) of approximately
8%.
(e) It was for the first time that a beer comprising approximately 8% Alcohol
By Volume was launched in India. ‗PALONE 8' traces its roots to the earlier
brands OKOCIM PALONE as well as BALTIKA 8, GRIMBERGEN GOLD 8 and DRAGON 8.
Defendant filed an application for registration of the marks ‗PALONE 8 label',
‗PALONE 8 DUMDAR MELA', and ‗8 KA DUM' with the Trade Marks Registry.
Defendant applied for registration of PALONE 8 label under No.2096009.The
product under the PALONE 8 label also became a great success.
(f) The gross sales revenue of the same from January 2011 to April 2011 is in
the region of Rs. 262.2 million (26.2 crore). CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.8 of
81
6\. The entire case of the plaintiff in nut-shell is that the use of the
numeral ‗8' by the defendant in relation to one of its products which is beer
under the mark PALONE infringes and violates the statutory and common law
rights of the plaintiff in its well known and registered mark ‗8 PM, numeral 8
being its essential, distinguishing and identifying feature.
7\. Learned Senior counsel for the plaintiff Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul has made
his submissions which can be enumerated as under:
> a) Firstly, learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the present case
> is a case involving the infringement of the trade mark wherein the trade
> mark 8 PM is registered with the plaintiff is 8pm in class 33 in respect of
> whisky and class 32 in respect of the juices of various kinds, drinking
> water and other allied goods.
> b) Mr. Kaul submits that the Trademarks Act, 1999 provides for the
> registration and protection of numerals as trademarks. The definition of the
> mark under Section 2 (m) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 expressly covers
> numerals. Courts have consistently upheld rights in numeral marks and have
> also passed the orders to restrain from time to time in infringement cases
> holding the misusers of the numeral mark liable. Learned senior counsel has
> referred the following decisions in support of his first submission:
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.9 of 81
> (i) Shaw Wallace & Co. v. Superior Industries Ltd. 2003 27 PTC 63 - Para 1,
> 5, 12, 14, 15-20, 27 (Marks Involved: Haywards 5000/Superior 5000)
> (ii) Jagan Nath Prem Nah v. Bhartiya Dhoop Karyalaya AIR 1975 Del 149 - Para
> 2, 8, 17-19 (Marks Involved: Kasturi 555/ Anand Durbar 555)
> (iii) M/s Vrajlal Manilal v. Adarsh Bidi Co.
1995 1 Arb. L.R 471-Para 2, 7, 10-12 (Marks Involved: 22/122)
(iv) Kamal Trading v. Gillette UK Limited 1988 1 (7' O Clock)
c) It is submitted by Mr. Kaul that it is a classic case of infringement of
trademark wherein the Plaintiff is the Registered Proprietor of the 8 PM in
India but also in other countries of the world. The details of registration
are given in Para 4 of the plaint. Section 28 of the Trade Mark Act, 1999
gives the registered proprietor the exclusive right to use of the registered
mark and the use of an ―identical‖ or ―deceptively similar‖ mark by another
without any permission/authority amounts to infringement of the registered
mark under Section 29 of the Act.
d) The registration of the plaintiffs' trademarks is not challenged by the
defendant or any third party, thus it is a valid registration within the
meaning of Section 32 of the Act and the court has to take the prima facie
view of the validity of the mark at this stage.
e) In support of his submission on the question of infringement, he has relied
upon the following decisions: The defendants' usage of CS(OS) No.1216/2011
Page No.10 of 81 the mark 8 as a trade mark without being a registered
proprietor is a clear invasion upon plaintiff's rights.
i. Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories
AIR1965SC980 - at 989- 990 page wherein it was held that:
"The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered
proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive
right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods"
"if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing
or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale
show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from
that of the registered proprietor of the make would be immaterial"
ii. In the case of American Home Products v. Mac Laboratories AIR 1986 SC 137
in Para 36 it was held as under:
"When a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires valuable rights by
reason of such registration. Registration of his trade mark give him the
exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in
respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right
by any other person using a mark which is the same or deceptively similar to
his trade mark, he can protect his trade mark by an action for infringement in
which he can obtain injunction...."
iii. In the case of National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Mfg. Co. AIR 1971 SC 898
at page 903 it was held as under: CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.11 of 81 "On
registration of a trade mark the registered proprietor gets under Section 28
the exclusive right to the use of such trade marks in relation to the goods in
respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect
of any infringement of such trade mark."
f) Mr. Kaul has referred the two images of the products used by the parties in
the present case in order to show that the defendant has taken the essential
and dominate feature of the main 8 without any valid justification.
PLAINTIFF DEFENDANT
g) Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the mark 8PM of the plaintiff
is registered in respect of whisky which is well known and famous mark and the
use of the mark by the defendant is in respect of beers which are the goods of
the same description CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.12 of 81 within the meaning
of Section 29 (1), (2) and (4) of the Trade Mark Act, 1999.
h) Thus, the infringement of the present trade mark 8PM of the plaintiff is in
respect of the same or similar goods and therefore the said infringement is
bound to cause confusion and deception in the market as to the source of the
goods.
8\. By relying the said observations of the Apex Court, learned counsel has
explained that there is no doubt that the courts must respect the registration
and the valuable rights of the plaintiff in the form of registration must be
given due credence in the form of interim injunction and third party use of
the same mark becomes irrelevant and injunction must follow in the present
case.
9\. On the aspect of an action of passing off, Mr. Kaul submits that the
defendant has deliberately and intentionally adopted and used the essential
feature of the mark i.e. numeral 8 in order to take the advantage of the
goodwill and reputation gained by the plaintiff in relation to its business as
two sets of products i.e. whisky and beers are allied and cognate goods which
are purchased by the same set of customers and sold by the same shopkeepers.
Both set of goods are placed side by side at the selling counter and served to
the consumer at the same time. CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.13 of 81
10\. Mr. Kaul has thus concluded the arguments by stating that the present
case is a straightforward case of infringement of the registered trade mark
rights of the plaintiff and the prima facie case is in the favour of the
plaintiff as the defendant by misusing the numeral mark 8 has slavishly copied
or imitated the mark of the plaintiff. The balance of convenience also falls
in favour of the plaintiff as the defendant is the recent entrant in the
market. The plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss in the event of rejection
of injunction. Therefore, this court should grant ad interim injunction
restraining the defendants from infringing the plaintiff mark 8PM.
11\. Per contra, learned Senior Counsel Dr. A.M. Singhvi, appearing on behalf
of the defendants has made his submissions which can be crystallized in the
following terms.
(i) Dr. A.M. Singhvi in his first submission states that the plaintiff is only
engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of ‗Whisky, Rum' (Class
33) under the brand 8 PM and is not at all in the business of ‗beer' which
falls in Class 32. The plaintiff has no registration for the brand 8 PM for
‗beer'. Plaintiff has got registered the mark 8 PM in Class 32 but only in
respect of mineral water and not beer etc. in Class 33. Thus, no case of
infringement is made out as the plaintiff's trademark is 8 PM in relation to
Whisky and Rum etc. and numeral 8 is admittedly not identical with the mark of
the plaintiff 8 PM CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.14 of 81 Therefore, the test of
passing off would apply while comparing the two marks in question.
(ii) The defendant's brand BALTIKA 8 is being used in Russia since the year
2001 and is registered in the USA in Class 32 in respect of ‗beer' with user
claimed since October 2007. The defendant is not using the mark 8 PM all
alone. It is being used along with international brand of the defendant who is
engaged in the business of beers.
(iii) That the defendant has obtained excise registrations for its PALONE 8
label in 24 States of the country. The said product was first launched in
January 2011 in Maharashtra. Defendant's affiliate/s has/have been using the
numeral 8 along with/as a part of famous international brands such as BALTIKA
8, GRIMBERGEN GOLD 8, DRAGON 8. The instant Suit was filed on May 16, 2011. On
the said date, defendant did not even had an excise approval in Delhi to sell
beer under PALONE 8 label. Therefore, the contention of Plaintiff that the
products of Defendant under PALONE 8 label are available within the
jurisdiction of Delhi is false, misleading and absurd.
(iv) That the plaintiff is not entitled to the exclusive proprietory rights
over the numeral mark ―8‖ due to following reasons:

12\. After reliance, as mentioned above, it is stated by Dr. Singhvi that the
numeral ‗8' is publici juris and common to the trade therefore, question of
any exclusivity in respect thereof to the Plaintiff alone does CS(OS)
No.1216/2011 Page No.16 of 81 not arise. As it has been mentioned in
Narayanan's Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off 6th Edition @ page 180 para
8.63 that "Numeral though come within the scope of the definition of a mark,
they are and cannot be prima facie considered distinctive or capable of
distinguishing as they are descriptive of the number of articles...". He
argues that the trademark consisting of a single number will always be
considered as lacking distinctive character unless presented with distinctive
stylization. Single numbers which have little or no stylization will normally
be open to objection because they are often used in trade to indicate model or
catalogue reference.
13\. In view of the abovementioned facts and documents referred, Dr. Singhvi
says that the plaintiff has failed to make out any case of infringement of
trademarks and passing off. In substance, the following reasons are given:
> (i) Plaintiff has no registration for the numeral ‗8' per se and no
> registration in respect of beer. It is common to the trade. The defendant is
> not using the numeral 8 per se
> (ii) The goods viz. beers and whisky are totally different; and belong to
> different segments as class of consumers is different; it is impossible for
> one to buy whisky for beer or vice-versa; even illiterate consumers will not
> be confused.
> (iii) The labels/packaging/bottles of 8 PM whisky and PALONE 8 beer are
> totally different.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.17 of 81
> Therefore, there has been no confusion and deception.
> (iv) Defendant's use of ‗8' is indicative of the kind, quantity and
> characteristics of the product in question. The Alcohol By Volume in
> Defendant's product is approximately 8%. Thus the use of the numeral ‗8' by
> Defendant is a bona fide description of the character of its goods.
> (v) Plaintiff's whisky is priced at approximately INR 300 whereas
> Defendant's beer bearing the label PALONE 8 is priced at INR 65. The
> plaintiffs sale of products and 8 PM is lower than defendant's sale.
14\. As regards the objection of the plaintiff about the Defendant's use of
slogan 8 KA DUM and the expression ROYALS on the basis of its erstwhile
campaign AATH KE THAATH and the expression ROYALE. No relief has been claimed
in the Suit in respect of the same thus the injunction does not arise. About
the mark Royal used by the defendant is concerned it is stated that though no
relief is sought in the plaint but even the plaintiff's application of 8 PM
Royale has been opposed by the third party. It is stated that the Plaintiff
has neither any interest in ‗beer' nor has any registration in respect of
‗beer' in Class 32 for its mark 8 PM.
15\. Thus, it is alleged that the plaintiff has not been able to make out a
prima facie case of infringement for the grant of injunction. This is more so
when there are several players in the whisky trade using 8 numeral but the
plaintiff has chosen to sue the defendant only who is CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.18 of 81 dealing in respect of the beers, therefore, no case is made out by
the plaintiff for infringement rather in view of the peculiar facts of the
present case, the plaintiff has not met its case under Section 29(4) as the
plaintiff has not been able to show that the main 8 PM has well known status
which seems unfeasible in view of several players in the market using the
expression or numeral 8 in respect of whisky itself who have more business
than the plaintiff and their user of the mark 8 numeral is prior to the use of
the plaintiff.
16\. Learned Senior Counsel Dr. Singhvi has vociferously argued that the use
of the numerals are quite common in the liquor industry as demonstrated from
the above listed drinks emanating from well known brands. It is further argued
that the numeral mark is per se non distinctive.
Learned Senior Counsel submitted that it is difficult to ascribe
distinctiveness to the numeral unless very high degree of distinctive
character is shown. Furthermore, the said distinctiveness has to be seen from
case to case basis and the plaintiff in the present case has been miserably
failed to show any such distinctiveness with respect to numeral 8 per se in
respect of whisky even due to the prevalent trade practice and thus the
plaintiff is clearly disentitle to any such protection.
17\. The next submission of the learned Senior Counsel is that the plaintiff
has approached this court after inordinate delay of 5 CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.19 of 81 months after attaining the knowledge about the defendant's
products under the mark PALONE 8. This has been explained by the plaintiff by
stating that Plaintiff's knowledge of the Defendant/its product dates back to
January 2011 when Defendant launched its product under PALONE 8 label in
Maharashtra. Defendant's label was published on the Notice Board of the Excise
Department, Mumbai for 15 days in January, 2011 for objections, if any.
Further, Plaintiff filed objections to the application filed by Defendant with
the Excise Office, Hyderabad for approval of PALONE 8 label in February 2011,
which was granted in favour of the Defendant.
18\. Lastly, Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel has argued that the
plaintiffs claim of passing off is also not made out due to following reasons:
> a) Defendant's products under PALONE 8 label are not so far available in
> Delhi.
> b) Defendant is using PALONE 8 label comprising its flagship brand PALONE
> whereas Plaintiff's mark is 8 PM
> c) 8 PM does not command goodwill/reputation.
> d) There has been no misrepresentation on the part of Defendant.
> e) The source of origin of the product bearing the PALONE 8 label is clearly
> discernible.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.20 of 81
> f) The goods viz. beers and whisky are totally different; and belong to
> different segments.
> g) The labels/packaging/bottles of 8 PM whisky and PALONE 8 beer are totally
> different.
> h) The Defendant's bottle is specially designed wherein its name is clearly
> embossed on the bottle.
> i) Class of consumers is different; it is impossible for one to buy whisky
> for beer or vice-versa; even illiterate consumers will not be confused.
> [Please see Khoday Distilleries Limited Vs. Scotch Whisky Association].
> j) Plaintiff's whisky is priced at approximately INR 300 whereas Defendant's
> beer bearing the label PALONE 8 is priced at INR
> 65\. [Please see White Horse Distillers Limited Vs. The Upper Doab Sugar
> Mills Limited].
> k) 8 KA DUM and AATH KE THAATH cannot be mistaken for each other. In any
> case 8 KA DUM is a slogan used on the product of the Defendant to indicate
> the strength i.e. 8% Alcohol By Volume, whereas the campaign AATH KE THAATH
> was in respect of music CDs of the Plaintiff which is no longer in use.
Therefore, it is argued by the defendant that in view of all abovementioned
factors the defendant cannot pass off its goods as that of goods of the
plaintiff.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.21 of 81
19\. I have gone through the pleadings, application, reply and documents filed
therewith and also the submissions made by the parties at the Bar. Before
dealing with the submissions of the parties, I deem it appropriate to discuss
the law on the subject on the question of infringement of trade mark.
INFRINGEMENT
20\. The law relating to infringement of a registered trademark has been
envisaged u/S 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and exclusive rights granted by
virtue of registration under Section 28 which reads as under:-
> "29. Infringement of registered trade marks - "Infringement of registered
> trade marks.- (1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not
> being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use,
> uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively
> similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of
> which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use
> of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.
> (2) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
> registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the
> course of trade, a mark which because of-
> (a) its identity with the registered trade mark and the similarity of the
> goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or
> (b) its similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity or CS(OS)
> No.1216/2011 Page No.22 of 81 similarity of the goods or services covered by
> such registered trade mark; or
> (c) its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the
> goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, is likely to cause
> confusion on the part of the public, or which is likely to have an
> association with the registered trade mark. (3) In any case falling under
> clause (c) of sub- section (2), the court shall presume that it is likely to
> cause confusion on the part of the public.
> (4) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a
> registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the
> course of trade, a mark which-
> (a) is identical with or similar to the registered trade mark; and
> (b) is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those
> for which the trade mark is registered; and
> (c) the registered trade mark has a reputation in India and the use of the
> mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the
> distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark. ......‖ ―28.
> Rights conferred by registration -
> (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade
> mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark
> the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or
> services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain
> relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided
> by this Act. (2) The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under
> sub-section (1) shall be subject to any conditions and limitations to which
> the registration is subject.
(3) Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trade marks, which
are identical with or nearly resemble each CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.23 of
81 other, the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not
(except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions or
limitations entered on the register) be deemed to have been acquired by any
one of those person as against any other of those persons merely by
registration of the trade marks but each of those persons has otherwise the
same rights as against other persons (not being registered users using by way
of permitted use) as he would have if he were the sole registered proprietor.‖
By mere reading of these provisions, it is clear that a registered trademark
is infringed by a person who not being a registered proprietor, uses in the
course of trade a mark which is identical or deceptively similar in relation
to the goods or services which are identical or similar to that in respect of
which the trademark is registered without the permission of the trademark
owner.
21\. So far as infringement qua different goods is concerned, separate
enactment of Section 29(4) makes it clear that the strict rigors are
prescribed as against the ordinary case of similar goods wherein a registered
proprietor has to establish that the registered trademark has reputation in
India and is of such a nature wherein the use of the mark by the other side
without due cause would tantamount to taking unfair advantage or detrimental
to the distinctive character or repute of a trademark.
22\. A reading of Section 29(4) of the Act would reveal that the said
protection qua different goods is earmarked by the Legislature for the
trademarks which are either highly reputed or well known or famous CS(OS)
No.1216/2011 Page No.24 of 81 trademarks and enjoy either high level of
distinctiveness or the marks which are inherently distinctive in nature or has
become distinctive due to their repute; the use of which will cause
detrimental to the distinctive character and repute of the trademark only when
the ingredients of Section 29(4) are satisfied conjunctively which is sub
sections (a), (b) and (c) the infringement qua Section 29(4) in relation to
different goods is attracted.
23\. Let me also examine the provisions relating to the limitations of
infringement of a trademark. For the purposes of present case, Section 30(1)
is relevant extract of the provision which is reproduced herein after:-
> Section 30 (1) Nothing in section 29 shall be construed as preventing the
> use of a registered trade mark by any person for the purposes of identifying
> goods or services as those of the proprietor provided the use-
> (a) is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial
> matters, and
> (b) is not such as to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the
> distinctive character or repute of the trade mark.
24\. A careful reading of Section 30(1) would reveal that the said Section
provides that nothing in Section 29 shall be construed as preventing the use
of a registered trademark by any person for the purposes of identifying the
goods or services as those of the proprietor CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.25 of
81 provided that the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial
or commercial matters. The said section is enacted within two parts which is
section 30(1) (a) and (b). In-between the two sub clauses the word used is
‗and‖ which means that both the conditions prescribed are to be satisfied
conjunctively which means that the user of any trademark for the purposes of
identifying the goods or services as those of the proprietor shall not be
construed as infringement if the use is in accordance with honest practices in
the industrial/commercial matters at the first place and is also not amounting
to taking unfair advantage or detrimental to the character or repute of the
trademark.
25\. Now, the question arises that what can be termed as the honest practices
in commercial or industrial matters as used in the sub clause (a). The said
honest practices in Industrial or commercial matters can be interpreted either
way as the honesty can be subjective terms inasmuch as what maybe honest in
the eyes of one person may not be honest in the eyes of another. Therefore, in
order to rule out the subjectivity in the expression ―honest practices in
industry or commercial matters‖, the Courts have developed the doctrine of
objectivity rather than the subjectivity while applying the test of honest
practices in the industry and commercial matters.
26\. By interpreting honest practices as those which are satisfying the
objective standards in Aktiebolaget Volvo V. Heritage (Leicester) CS(OS)
No.1216/2011 Page No.26 of 81 Ltd cited as 2000 FSR 253, the Chancery Division
has said " It appears to be now well settled that the test of honesty for the
purposes of the proviso is one that has to be judged by an objective standard
and in my judgment the appropriate question to be asked in relation to the
test in the present case is whether a reasonable motor service provider would
think the use complained of in the present case to be honest, or, rather, in
accordance with honest practices in that business (see Cable & Wireless PLC &
Anr. V. British Telecommunications PLC). The Court further held that the
application of the proviso namely "the use in accordance with honest practices
in industrial or commercial matters" involves "looking at the particular use
complained of as being an infringement of the relevant trademark and
determining whether a reasonable person in the trade concerned, that is to
say, in this case the trade of motor car service provider, knowing all the
relevant facts that the defendant knew would think it an honest use of a trade
mark concerned - that is to say, honest use in the commercial activity in
which such a trader is involved. That, in my judgment, must involve
considering all the circumstances surrounding the use complained of and the
context in which that use was made."
27\. From the above, it is clear that the honest practices in
commercial/industrial matters have to be seen from the two standpoints of
objectivity. First is the standpoint of a reasonable person in the trade
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.27 of 81 whether he will think that the said use
is in the honest way after knowing fully well about the trade and secondly
from the perspective of the practices prevalent in the industry, which means
that what the other persons/proprietors are doing in the same industry and if
there is an established practice in the industry to use such expression in the
particular manner, then it would not be unfair to call that practice as
honest.
28\. The second test is relevant due to the express wordings of the Section 30
(1) (a) which are honest practices in industrial or commercial matters. Once
the said provision provides for such honest practices in the industrial or
commercial matters as an exception to an infringement, then the said practice
in the trade becomes relevant for the purposes of examining any case where the
infringement is alleged by the proprietor.
29\. Thus, the standards of determining what is honest and what is not would
be much dependent upon the practice and the manner of usage of that expression
which is prevalent in the market. After all that is what is called objective
standards rather than subjective use which may vary from one person to
another.
30\. From the above discussion, another thing is clear that it is always not
necessary to infer that trade practice is honest solely because the manner of
use of the expression is in descriptive sense and not in a CS(OS) No.1216/2011
Page No.28 of 81 prominent fashion. The converse may be true also in some
cases. There are certain industries wherein special emphasis has to be given
to the said expression upon the product or an ingredient of the product so as
to catch the customers or attract the consumer rather than using it as a small
word on the label. Just like in liquor industry wherein one has to prominently
display as to how old that liquor is by mentioning the number of years or the
volume of content of alcohol.
31\. Thus, the decisive test for examining the honest practice in industrial
practice is not prominence or non-prominence of the said expression which may
though be relevant but much will be dependent upon the manner of use of the
said expression as warranted in the said industry which will set out the limit
for what can be the honest and what can be dishonest.
32\. The propositions which are emerging from the abovementioned discussions
are as under:-
> a) That Section 30 acts as an exception to Section 29 which provides for
> infringement of trademark;
> b) Section 30(1) safeguards the use of the trademark by anyone other than
> the registered proprietor if the use of the said trademark is in accordance
> with the honest practices in the industrial or commercial matters and is not
> such as to take CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.29 of 81 unfair advantage of or
> be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the trade mark.
> c) Honest practices in the industry/ industrial or commercial matters have
> to be examined objectively and not subjectively for which it can be tested
> on two-fold basis:-
> i) Reasonable man having knowledge in the trade.
> ii) Practice prevalent in the respective industry.
33\. Let me now proceed to discuss the law relating to numeral trademarks.
Section 2(1)(m) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines the expression ‗mark'
which is reproduced herein below:-
> Section 2(1)(m) "mark" includes a device, brand, heading, label, ticket,
> name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or
> combination of colours or any combination thereof."
34\. On bare perusal of the said definition, it becomes clear that the said
definition is an inclusive definition which includes numeral. Mark also
includes numerals which shows and denotes that the said numeral can perform
the function of a trademark. Although numeral has been included in the
definition of mark but it has to be examined as to whether a single-numeral 8
in the facts and circumstances of the present case can be protected while
comparing the two marks of the parties, i.e. 8 PM and PALONE 8 and the two
sets of goods are whisky and beer. Likewise, Dr. Venkateswaran on Trademarks
and Passing CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.30 of 81 off (5th Edition 2010) also
observes about the numeral trademarks as under:-
> "Mark‖ is defined to include letters and numerals - See Section 2(1)(m).
> However, they notoriously lack inherent distinctiveness on account of common
> and natural practice of firms and persons to use their initials on goods,
> letter paper and so forth, or to use them as symbols indicative of quality
> or of other characteristics. Whether a letter or numeral mark can be
> registered prima facie will therefore depend upon whether it is devoid of
> any distinctive character. Letters and numerals also presented with
> additional features or which are intertwined, conjoined etc. and which have
> a trade mark character will be accepted."(Emphasis Supplied"
> ―For example, numbers, letters which may be used in trade for bona fide
> description will entail objections under Section 9(1) (c ) are:-
>  The date of production of goods/ provision of services (e.g. 2001, 2002) 
> Size, eg XL for clothes, 1600 for cars, 34R for clothing, 185/65 for tyres.
>  Quantity 20, 200 for cigarettes.
>  Dates for printed matter eg 1066 for history books, 1996 for wines, 2003
> for anything.
>  Telephone codes eg 022, 011, 033 etc.  The time of provision of service,
> eg 8 to 10  The power of goods eg 115 (BHP) for engines or cars.  Speed,
> eg 386, 486, 586, 686, & 166, 266 for computers.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.31 of 81
>  Strength eg, "8.5% for lager."(Emphasis Supplied) The reliance of the
> above referenced excerpts from the authority would show and reveal that even
> it is recognized in the field of the trade marks that there are certain
> numerals which are considered to be of non distinctive character and also
> having some connection with the trade. Numeral 8 is one of those numerals
> which are earmarked as one which has some connection and relevance in the
> field of beer as mentioned above. Further, it also clarifies the position in
> the law that the numeral trade marks which are intertwined with other
> features can succeed for registration. But then it is to be looked into that
> the monopoly can be accorded to the numeral per se or the mark in totality.
35\. The said argument that the numeral 8 is common to the trade and also has
some relevance with the alcohol trade also gains strength when the defendants
stand is examined wherein the defendants have shown number of major players
/traders in the alcohol trade to be using the numeral 8 on their labels. Dr.
Singhvi, learned Senior counsel has relied upon the entries on the registers
worldwide as well as in India and also the labels of the current use of
several alcoholic drinks so as to demonstrate that the numeral 8 is common to
the trade. The said entries and the pictorial representation thereof of the
same are reproduced hereinafter:
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.32 of 81
> Signature 8, a whisky, was recently launched by United Spirits Limited.
> BACARDI 8 RUM - a variant of well-known BACARDI brand was launched in the
> year 2000.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.33 of 81
> CELLAR NO. 8 is a well known Californian Red Wine. The same is being sold
> since 1881.
> BLACK DOG 8 whisky, a premium scotch whisky brand, is being sold in India by
> United CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.34 of 81 Spirits Ltd. since the year
> 2006.
> V8 VEGETABLE JUICE - V8 is a well-known Vegetable juice brand. V8 was
> launched in 1933 and have been available in India since at least the year
> 2005. ―A few cocktail drinks use V8, most famously the "bloody eight" or
> "eight ball", which is a Bloody Mary with V8 instead of tomato juice‖.
36\. By citing the detailed analysis of aforementioned brands of alcoholic
drinks available in the market, the learned Senior counsel for the defendant
sought to urge that the plaintiff's grievance is nothing but a frivolous one
and it does not survive in view of the market trend demonstrated above, and it
reveals that there are not merely entries on CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.35 of
81 the register which reveal ―8‖ as one of the features of the registration
but rather there is substantive actual user by the third parties.

CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.42 of 81
38\. It is also submitted by the defendant that plaintiff has not obtained any
separate registration for ‗8' or ‗P.M.' per se. Numeral ‗8' is common to trade
as large number of manufacturers in India and abroad are using the Numeral ‗8'
in relation to similar business as that of the plaintiff. even some of them
prior to user of the plaintiff. It is also argued by Mr. Singhvi that
Plaintiff's mark 8 PM is descriptive. It attributes 8 PM to the preferred
recreation time of the evening when everyone desires to unwind. Realizing that
the mark is inherently non-distinctive, the Registrar of Trademarks granted
the registration to Plaintiff for its trade marks 8 PM in Part B of the
Register.
The defendant has also referred the search report issued by the Trade Marks
Registry as well as the Trade Marks Offices of various countries in order to
indicate numerous ‗8'/‗8' formative applications/ registrations in India and
internationally standing in the name of different entities.
39\. The defendant has placed on record the evidence which shows that there
are various other international brands which use 8/8 formative marks in
relation to products falling in Classes 32 and 33 and are available
internationally. Defendant has filed images of several products using 8/8
formative marks. Few examples of such brands are reproduced hereinbelow:

40\. I find substance in contention of the learned counsel for the defendant
that the numeral mark 8 is prima facie of non distinctive character. This is
due to following reasons:
>  That the aforementioned analysis done by the defendants itself shows that
> major players or competitor like Bacardi, Signature and others etc
> nationally and internationally use the numeral 8 on their label. Thus, it
> does not remain the case of mere formal entries on the register but also is
> backed by the substantive user of the other parties which negatives the
> claims of exclusivity.
>  There are authorities on the subject stating that there are some numerals
> like 8.5 or atleast 8 which are requirement of the trade which denotes the
> strength. The said aspect further clarifies that there is some nexus of the
> numeral 8 in respect of alcohol drinks.
>  The plaintiffs are not registered for 8 per se and rather the registration
> is of 8PM in Part B of the register. The mark on part B was considered to be
> weak trade mark and rather prima facie descriptive one. The exclusivity in
> the said mark can be defeated by showing the evidence of non
> distinctiveness. In the present case, the same thing has been shown.
>  Overall by reading section 30 of the Act and testing the numeral 8 on the
> principles of the same (which I have already dealt with above on honest
> practices of trade), the use of the numeral in CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
> No.46 of 81 these circumstances by a tradesman when there are such
> overwhelming user by other parties as stated above coupled with the nexus of
> numeral in the trade, it can be safely said that use of the numeral 8 by any
> other person including defendant in respect of alcohol or beers cannot be
> said to be dishonest and would be protected by section 30 of the Act.
41\. Thus, it is prima facie established that the numeral 8 has the role to
play in the industry of liquor, but no doubt and the defendant as bona fide
description is entitled to use the same in order to denote the strength of the
product.
42\. However, one should not forget that the Apex Court has further extended
this proposition by stating that where there is a case of infringement of
trade marks wherein the marks are not identical but are deceptively similar,
the tests for measuring the case of infringement and passing off coincide and
they become the same. (See Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. vs. The Zamindara Engineering
Co., 1970 SCR (2) 222). The same has also been upheld by this court in Allied
Blenders and Distillers P. Ltd. vs. Paul P. John and Ors., 2008 (38) PTC 568
(Del).
43\. In the present case also, the competing trade marks are 8 PM per se in
respect of whisky and PALONE 8 in respect of the beers. At the first place,
the marks of both the plaintiff as well as the defendants CS(OS) No.1216/2011
Page No.47 of 81 are not identical but at the best these can be considered as
deceptively similar as numeral 8 in both the trade marks is common.
44\. It is the admitted position that the registration obtained by the
plaintiff in Clauses 32 & 33 is not pertaining to the beers as the said both
registrations on the face of it are in relation to Whisky and Mineral Water,
etc. Under Section 28, the rights are conferred by the registration to the
registered proprietor to the use trade mark in relation to the goods or
services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain the
relief in respect of the infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided
by the Act.
45\. Under Section 29(1) of the Act, a registered trade mark is infringed by a
person who, not being a registered proprietor of the mark, uses in the course
of trade, which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark
in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the same is
registered or use of the mark is likely to be taken as being used as trade
mark.
Under sub-section (2) and (3) of Section 29 postulates that in case the Court
finds similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity and similarity
of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, there is a
presumption that the use of mark by a person who not being a registered
proprietor is likely to cause confusion CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.48 of 81
on the part of the public or which is likely to have an association with the
registered trade mark.
46\. Unless the prominent feature of the mark is proved to be prima facie
enjoying high degree of distinctiveness which may become heart and soul of
particular trade mark, such kind of monopoly cannot be accorded to the same.
This may not hold true in the case of single letter or numeral like 8 which
has been extensively used by the number of major players selling alcohol and
is a requirement of the trade as a practice denoting strength.
47\. In the present case, admittedly, the defendant is not using the trade
mark - the numeral-8, in relation to Whisky and Mineral Water for which the
plaintiff has obtained the registration in Clauses-32 & 33 of the Act. As
already stated that the present case is also not covered under sub-section (4)
of Section 29 of the Act, therefore, the plaintiff cannot derive the benefits
available in sub-section (4) of Section 29 of the Act which provides
additional protection for infringement of trade mark in relation to dissimilar
goods.
48\. The other important aspect of the matter is that the main registration
obtained by the plaintiff bearing mark ‗8 PM' under Registration No.783398 in
Clause-33 as of 24.12.1997 advertised in Journal No.9998-2 was granted under
the old Act, i.e. Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in Part-B. In the said
Act, the CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.49 of 81 registration could have been
granted by the Registrar of Trade Marks in Part- under Sections 7 & 9 of the
Act due to the prevailing circumstances at the time of granting the
registration. In the said Act, under Section 29(2), in an action for
infringement of a trade mark in case the registration is granted in Part-B and
the defendant is able to establish to satisfy the Court that the mark is not
likely to deceive or cause confusion in the trade and some other person having
the rights either as registered proprietor or registered user, the relief
under those circumstances shall not be granted to the plaintiff.
49\. Section 17 provides the effect of registration of parts of the trade
mark. The said Section reads as under:-
> ―17. Registration of trade marks subject to disclaimer. If a trade mark -
> (a) contains any part -
> (i) which is not the subject of a separate application by the proprietor for
> registration as a trade mark; or
> (ii) which is not separately registered by the proprietor as a trade mark;
> or
> (b) contains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a
> non-distinctive character;
> The tribunal, in deciding whether the trade mark shall be entered or shall
> remain on the register, may require, as a condition of its being on the
> register, that the proprietor shall either disclaim any right to the
> exclusive use of such part or of all or any portion of such matter, as the
> case may be, to the exclusive use of which the tribunal holds him not to be
> entitled, or make such other disclaimer as the tribunal may consider
> necessary for the purpose of defining the rights of the proprietor under the
> registration:
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.50 of 81
> Provided that no disclaimer shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a
> trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in
> respect of which the disclaimer is made.‖ It is the admitted position in the
> present case that the numeral-
8 is a part of the trade mark which is not separately registered in favour of
the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff has got the registration of the trade
mark ‗8 PM'. Therefore, in view of the fact that no separate registration is
granted, the test of passing off under those circumstances would apply.
The infringement of the mark is also not to be made out in view of the Part B
registrations relied upon by the defendant. It is now well settled that the
Part B registrations are granted to the marks which even the registrar of the
trade mark also considers to be prima facie non distinctive or descriptive.
Section 29 of the old Act in this respect is equally apposite which reads as
under:
> ―29. Infringement of trade marks.
> (1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being the
> registered proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user thereof using
> by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark which is
> identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark, in relation to
> any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such
> manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being use as a
> trade mark.
> (2) In an action for infringement of a trade mark registered in Part B of
> the register an injunction or other relief shall not be granted to the
> plaintiff if the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court
> CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.51 of 81 that the use of the mark of which the
> plaintiff complains is not likely to deceive or cause confusion or to be
> taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade between the goods in
> respect of which the trade mark is registered and some person having the
> right, either as registered proprietor or as registered user, to use the
> trade mark."
Thus, the mark if it is shown to be descriptive one or the one which does not
indicate connection in the course of the trade by the plaintiff even at during
the infringement proceedings, the injunction against the defendant cannot be
granted as then it is outside the purview of the infringement.
The said aspect becomes relevant as then the plaintiffs case of Part B
registration is overcome by the evidence of the descriptiveness or non
distinctiveness of the numeral 8. Thus, the said act is not an infringement
under the old Act.
At this stage, it is relevant to examine the saving clause of section 159 of
the Trade Marks Act which reads as under:
> ―159. Repeal and savings.--
> (1) The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) is hereby
> repealed.
> (2) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in the General Clauses
> Act, 1897 (10 of 1897), with respect to repeals, any notification, rule,
> order, requirement, registration, certificate, notice, decision,
> determination, direction, approval, authorisation, consent, application,
> request or thing made, issued, given or done under the Trade and Merchandise
> Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) shall, if in force at the commencement of this
> Act, continue CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.52 of 81 to be in force and have
> effect as if made, issued, given or done under the corresponding provisions
> of this Act.
> (3) The provisions of this Act shall apply to any application for
> registration of a trade mark pending at the commencement of this Act and to
> any proceedings consequent thereon and to any registration granted in
> pursuance thereof.
> (4) Subject to the provisions of section 100 and notwithstanding anything
> contained in any other provision of this Act, any legal proceeding pending
> in any court at the commencement of this Act may be continued in that court
> as if this Act had not been passed.
> (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where a particular use
> of a registered trade mark is not an infringement of a trade mark registered
> before the commencement of this Act, then, the continued use of that mark
> shall not be an infringement under this Act.
> (6) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the date of
> expiration of registration of a trade mark registered before the
> commencement of this Act shall be the date immediately after the period of
> seven years for which it was registered or renewed‖
50\. A bare reading of the sub section 159(5) would reveal that the same is
the non obstante clause and would therefore prevail over in addition to what
has been stated under the Act. The new Act of 1999 although extends the
registration under the existing law of 1958 to the New Act. However, the
exception is carved out under sub section (5) which states that the particular
user of the mark if it is not an infringement under the old Act then, the same
shall also not to be an infringement under this Act.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.53 of 81
51\. The combined reading of Section 29 of the old Act and saving clause of
section 159 makes it amply clear that the user of the numeral 8 would not have
been an infringement under the old act and injunction cannot be granted if it
is established the said numeral does not indicate the connection in the course
of the trade with the plaintiff. Thus, the said user cannot be extended to be
an infringement under the new act by virtue of the saving clause of section
159 of the Act of 1999.
52\. There is an additional surrounding factor which is seen from the search
report relied upon by the defendant wherein the entry no. 1008765 in the name
of some Baldev Pawan which reveals that the mark 8PM is registered since the
year 2001 which is still renewed in respect of Beers which is not the
plaintiff concern. On the otherhand, the plaintiff has relied upon the
registration of mineral water etc to claim infringement against beers under
the same class 32. I think the said factor is also crucial factor both for the
purposes of infringement and passing off as some third party is holding the
registration of the mark 8PM in respect of the beers and not the plaintiff.
This also becomes a surrounding circumstance for the purposes of the grant or
non grant of injunction.
53\. Therefore, I am of the prima facie view that the registrations relied
upon by the plaintiff do not establish the prima facie case of infringement
under section 29 (1) and 29 (2) as I have already CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.54 of 81 expressed doubts about the nature of goods being either non
similar or similar which depends number tests discussed by me along with the
facts to be proved in trial. Thus, it is more of a mixed question of law and
fact. At this stage, suffice it to say that the registration of the plaintiff
clearly do not cover beer, the said registration are in Part B which are weak
ones, the goods can be conclusive said to be similar goods, therefore, the
infringement under section 29 (1) (2) and (3) cannot be established. So far as
grounds under section 29(4) is concerned, the other surrounding factors like
extensive user of the numeral 8 by the other parties, observations that 8 has
a role in liquor industry and other factors discussed above prevents the
numeral 8 to be categorized as reputed mark of the plaintiff and the user of
the same is protected under section 30 of the Act. Therefore, I am prime facie
of the view that no case is made out in view of statutory provision of
Sections 28 and 29 in order to establish the case of infringement. The
surrounding factors like no infringement of Part B registration under the old
act, 8 is not per se registered in view of section 17 of the Act, registration
of someone else in relation to beers also act as special circumstances which
militate against the grant of injunction.
Thus, the decisions referred by the plaintiff on the point of infringement are
not applicable as in those case, two set of goods of the parties were same. As
far as proposition of law in those cases referred CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.55 of 81 to by the plaintiff is concerned, there is no dispute that law
laid down in those decisions well-established law.
54\. So far as the judgments cited by the plaintiff in the cases of Shaw
Wallace & Co. v. Superior Industries Ltd., 2003 27 PTC 63, Jagan Nath Prem Nah
v. Bhartiya Dhoop Karyalaya, (Marks Involved: Kasturi 555/ Anand Durbar 555),
M/s Vrajlal Manilal v. Adarsh Bidi Co., 1995 1 Arb. L.R 471-Para 2, 7, 10-12,
& Kamal Trading v. Gillette UK Limited, 1988 PTC 1 (7' O Clock) are concerned,
the same are distinguishable on the facts and circumstances of each case. The
same are distinguished as under:
 In Shaw Wallace (Supra), the court was concerned with a mark 5000 which is
not a single letter mark for strict rigors of law are applicable. It is now
well established and has even stated in the Narayanan on Trade mark and other
authorities that as the letters or numeral in the marks grows from two to
three and thereon, the said numerals or letters comes closer to the trade
mark. The relevant excerpt for the same is reproduced herein after.
Further in Shaw Wallace, the court was concerned with the case of Beer versus
Beer wherein the plaintiff is well known in the market which is the major
point of distinction with that of the present case with that of Shaw Wallace
(supra).
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.56 of 81  Again in Jagan Nath (Supra), the court
was concerned with the three letter mark rather than a single letter mark.
Further again the goods in that case were identical which are aggarbatties.
The said mark was essential feature of the mark which was considered by the
court as distinctive. I have also held in the present case that in a given
case where it is established the essential feature of the mark is such which
is heart and soul of the mark which has enjoys distinctiveness can enjoy equal
level of monopoly. However, the same may not hold good for a single letter
mark like 8 which is supposed to be prima facie of non distinctive character
and has been used several major players in the market to denote and connote
strength of the alcoholic drink. The said judgment is distinguishable on facts
 Again in Virajlal (Supra), this court was concerned with the mark 22 which
was used in the market for 5 decades in respect of bidis. The said mark 22 per
se stood registered with the plaintiff as noted by the court. The defendant
adopted the mark 122 which subsume 22 in respect of identical goods which are
bidis. The same is accordingly distinguishable on its facts  In Kamal Trading
(Supra), the court was concerned with the world famous mark 7 O CLOCK which
was used for more than 30 years for shaving creams, shaving brushes rajors etc
and the defendant CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.57 of 81 used the identical mark
for tooth brushes and the Bombay Division Bench rightly confirmed the
injunction. The said case is distinguishable on facts as in the said case, the
court was concerned with the usage of identical mark 7 O CLOCK by the
defendant and not a part of the numeral mark and the mark 7 OCLOCK is not a
single letter mark but a composite mark. All the facts are sufficient to take
out the present case from that of the judgment of Kamal Trading (Supra).
55\. Thus, the said judgments on numeral marks are distinguishable on the
facts and circumstances. Further, the judgments relied upon the defendants
upon the legal effect of registration as rendered by the Apex court, no one is
disputing the said judgments but in the present case, the plaintiff is
registered with 8 PM in respect of whisky and the case involves use of the
numeral 8 in respect of Beers which is not falling within the registration of
the plaintiffs. Thus, the said judgments cannot aid the case of the plaintiff.
Further, the tests of the infringement and passing off coincide when the marks
are deceptively similar as laid down by the apex court itself also comes under
the way of this court to extend the effect of the registration of the
plaintiff to the part of the mark which is to the numeral 8 when it is not per
se registered under Section 17 of the Act.
PASSING OFF CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.58 of 81
56\. Mr. Kaul further argues that third party usage is no defense in a trade
mark infringement and passing off action and further that a Plaintiff is not
expected to sue each and every infringer.
 Bhagwan Dass Gupta v. Shri Shiv Shankar Tirath Yatra Company Pvt. Ltd.: 93
(2001) DLT 406 - Para  10 "the basic test to find out whether a particular
mark is publici juris or not is that if the mark has come to be so public
because of its universal use that it does not confuse or deceive, by the use
of it, the purchasers of the goods of the original trader."
 Shri Pankaj Goel v. Dabur India Ltd.
FAO (OS) 82 of 2008 - Para 22 "22. As far as the Appellant's argument that the
word MOLA is common to the trade and that variants of MOLA are available in
the market, we find that the Appellant has not been able to prima facie prove
that the said 'infringers' had significant business turnover or they posed a
threat to plaintiff's distinctiveness. In fact, we are of the view that the
Respondent/plaintiff is not expected to sue all small type infringers who may
not be affecting Respondent/plaintiff business. The Supreme Court in National
Bell v. Metal Goods reported in AIR 1971 SC 898 has held that a proprietor of
a trademark need not take action against infringement which do not cause
prejudice to its distinctiveness. In Express Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. v.
Pepsi Inc. and Ors. reported in 1989 (7) PTC 14 it has been held as under:
...To establish the plea of common use, the use by other persons should be
shown to be substantial. In the present case, there is no evidence regarding
the extent of the trade carried on by the alleged infringers or their
respective position in the trade. If the proprietor of the mark is expected to
pursue each and every insignificant infringer to save his mark, the business
will come to a standstill. Because there may be occasion when the malicious
persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his mark by CS(OS) No.1216/2011
Page No.59 of 81 way of pinpricks.... The mere use of the name is irrelevant
because a registered proprietor is not expected to go on filing suits or
proceedings against infringers who are of no consequence.... Mere delay in
taking action against the infringers is not sufficient to hold that the
registered proprietor has lost the mark intentionally unless it is positively
proved that delay was due to intentional abandonment of the right over the
registered mark. This Court is inclined to accept the submissions of the
respondent No. 1 on this point.... The respondent No. 1 did not lose its mark
by not proceeding against insignificant infringers....
In fact, in Dr. Reddy Laboratories v. Reddy Paharmaceuticals reported in 2004
(29) PTC 435 a Single Judge of this Court has held as under:
...the owners of trade marks or copy rights are not expected to run after
every infringer and thereby remain involved in litigation at the cost of their
business time. If the impugned infringement is too trivial or insignificant
and is not capable of harming their business interests, they may overlook and
ignore petty violations till they assume alarming proportions. If a road side
Dhaba puts up a board of "Taj Hotel", the owners of Taj Group are not expected
to swing into action and raise objections forthwith. They can wait till the
time the user of their name starts harming their business interest and starts
misleading and confusing their customers."
 Rolex Sa v. Alex Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. 2009 (41) PTC 284 (Del) - Para
22 "22. The next aspect to be considered is the effect/impact, if any, of a
large number of other persons using the word ROLEX as claimed by the
defendant. At this stage, this plea will be examined believing the same to be
true. In my view, the same would be immaterial. Firstly, nothing has been
shown that any of the said users has any significant presence. Secondly, it is
now well settled in Honda (supra) in turn relying upon Indian Shaving Products
Ltd. v. Gift Pack that merely because the plaintiff who is otherwise found
entitled to the interim injunction is shown to have CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.60 of 81 not taken any step against other infringers is no ground to deny
relief to the plaintiff. It cannot also be said that the plaintiff's trademark
has lost its distinctiveness for the said reason. The reply affidavit of the
plaintiff lists the orders of the Trade Mark Registry from 1964 to 2000, where
plaintiff's mark has been protected inter alia for reason of having great
reputation. It also shows that the plaintiff has been enforcing its rights.
Though the list filed by defendant No. 1 in this regard is long but a perusal
thereof shows a number of applicants to have abandoned or withdrawn their
applications. This is a vast country. Mere long list of applicants/registrants
of mark, without any extensive use of the mark, cannot dent the distinctive
character or repute of the mark."
 Express Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Pepsi Inc. and Ors. 1989 (9) PTC 14 -
Para 50 "50.To establish the plea of common use, the use by other persons
should be shown to be substantial. In the present case, there is no evidence
regarding the extent of the trade carried on by the alleged infringers or
their respective position in the trade. If the proprietor of the mark is
expected to pursue each and every insignificant infringer to save his mark,
the business will come to a standstill. Because there may be occasion when the
malicious persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his mark by way of
pinpricks. In answer to this allegation, the respondent No. 1 in Joyce's
supplementary affidavit dated 1.12.86 stated that there was no whisper of this
case of public use of the mark in the petition itself. This case has been set
up for the first time in the affidavit-in-reply. Moreover, 'Pepsi' and
'Pepsicola' were registered as carbonated beverages, syrups and concentrates
under Class 32 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act
1958\. It is alleged by the petitioner that the mark 'pepsi' is being used by
others in respect of ice, ice-cream or ice candies which come under class 30
of the said Fourth Schedule and the sealing machine manufactured in the name
of Pepsi comes under Class 7 of the 4th Schedule relating to machine and
machine tools. The alleged banners, stickers, danglers, etc. disclosed by the
petitioner for establishing common use of the marks of the respondent No. 1
are not the type of goods CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.61 of 81 for which the
marks of the respondent No. 1 were registered. The use of the mark Pepsi on
goods falling within Class 7 or 30 are wholly irrelevant for the purpose of
this case. Moreover, the plea of common use must fail because for establishing
that, it must be proved that the businesses carried on by the infringers are
of similar nature and are extensive and substantial. The mere use of the name
is irrelevant because a registered proprietor is not expected to go on filing
suits or proceedings against infringers who are of no consequence."
 Indian Shaving Products Ltd & Anr v. Gift Pack & Anr 1998 PTC (18) - Para 52
& 53 "52. It was next argued by the learned counsel for the defendant that the
said trade mark Ultra is being used by several other persons/companies besides
the defendants such as Toshiba, National and Sony. Thus the same has become
publici Juris and the plaintiffs can not claim any exclusive right therein.
53\. Admittedly, the said parties are not before this Court. Neither the said
parties are claiming any relief against the plaintiffs nor the plaintiffs are
claiming any relief against them. Hence the said defense, that other persons
are also using the said trade mark, is not available to the defendants. The
Court is called upon to decide disputes in between the parties which are
before it. The Court cannot be expected to adjudicate upon a dispute which is
not before it."
 Novartis AG v. Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. 2009 (41) PTC 57 - Para 32,
33 "32. The next contention of the defendant is that there are number of other
companies who are using the similar trade mark as that of the plaintiff, those
are CEFF, SIMCEF, CEF, BECEF, SYCEF, CEACEF, SYCEF, SICEF and C- CEF. The
contention of the defendant has no force as the defendants have failed to
produce any evidence of the actual user of the said marks referred by the
defendants. In order to take the said defence, the party has to give cogent
evidence before this Court as to since when these trade marks are being used
and what is the goodwill and CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.62 of 81 reputation
of the said trade marks. The defendant in the present case has not produced
the samples of the third parties in order to show as to whether the said marks
are being used and goods are available in the market or not. The similar
defence raised in various cases has been dealt by the courts from time to time
in the cases of Century Traders (supra), Corn Products refining Co. v.
Shangrila Food Products Ltd.AIR 1960 SUPREME COURT 142 and Pankaj Goel v.
Dabur India Ltd. 2008(38) PTC 49 (Del). Relevant part of the decision of Corn
product(supra) is reproduced hereinbelow:
17\. The series of marks containing the common element or elements therefore
only assist the applicant when those marks are in extensive use in the market.
The onus of proving such user is of course on the applicant, who wants to rely
on those marks. Now in the present case the applicant, the respondent before
us, led no evidence as to the user of marks with the common element. What had
happened was that Deputy Registrar looked into his register and found there a
large number of marks which had either 'Gluco' or 'Vita' as prefix or suffix
in it. Now of course the presence of a mark in the register does not prove its
user all. It is possible that the mark may have been registered but not used.
It is not permissible to draw any inference as to their user from the presence
of the marks on the register.
33\. A mere filing of the search report from the trademarks office does not
prove as to whether the marks mentioned in search report was actually been
used or not. It is imperative on the part of the party who relies upon the
marks of third party to produce cogent and clear evidence of user in order to
prove the defence of common marks to the trademark on the basis of the third
party user. Hence, in the absence of valid and cogent evidence, the submission
of the defendant cannot be accepted."
57\. It is argued by the plaintiff that the plea of the Defendant is nothing
but a bald averment without any merits. The Defendant in the instant case has
failed to discharge the onus of leading evidence in CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.63 of 81 support of this argument as mandated by various judicial
pronouncements cited herein above. It is stated that the Defendant in support
of this argument has also sought to rely upon certain website printouts, but
all these printouts date subsequent to the institution of the suit, otherwise
why the defendant itself would apply the Mark 8 for registration in respect of
Beers, thus defence set up by the Defendant is meritless which has been only
to justify its illegal acts. The third party usages referred by the defendant
would show BACARDI RON 8 ANOS and BLACK DOG AGED 8 YEARS refers only to the
age of the product otherwise no invoice has been placed on record to show that
these products are readily available for sale in India bearing the Mark 8.
58\. In the present case, the principles for measuring the deceptive
resemblance are overlapping, be it of infringement or of passing off, as the
marks are not identical to each other but merely numeral 8 is same in the
rival marks of both parties i.e. 8PM versus PALONE 8. Thus, it would not be
unwise to rely upon third party user in the present case.
59\. It is true as stated by the plaintiff that the third party user may or
may not be a relevant consideration in the infringement case but I feel that
it may be considered in the case of passing off to the extent when the
defendant is able to produce cogent evidence about the user of third party
which is prior to the user of the plaintiff's mark. CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.64 of 81
60\. It is one thing to say that there are some third parties using the mark
of the plaintiff in question which may be a defence in equity relevant in
equitable remedies, however it is another thing to say that there is a honest
practice in industrial matters or commercial matters which is a statutorily
recognized defence or an exception to an infringement. If there is a prima
facie material on record to demonstrate the numeral as requirement of the
trade or trade practice, it may not be appropriate to discard the same when
the law allows such practice to be considered by the Courts.
61\. I have gone through the decisions referred to by the plaintiff on the
aspect and I agree with the submission of the plaintiff that a mere filing of
search report received from the trade marks office and occasionally user by
third parties in tainted manner, the defendant cannot derive any benefit out
of it. But circumstances of such nature depend upon case to case basis.
62\. It is well said that each case of trade mark depends upon its own
circumstances. The decisions referred by the plaintiff in support of its
submissions are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present
case, as in all the cases referred by the plaintiff, the trade marks of the
parties were distinctive and in some of the cases, the brands were well-known
brand names. This Court, therefore, cannot compare those cases as per the
facts of the present case in hand. CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.65 of 81
63\. Thus, in the present case, the contention that the Court is precluded
from seeing the third parties use is also not correct as two sets of
goods/products of the parties are not same. All the decisions referred to by
the plaintiff are those cases wherein the goods of the parties are same. In
the present case, the defendant has not only to show extensive third party
user of numeral 8 in relation to whisky, the goods used by the plaintiff but
also to show the prima facie evidence that some of the third parties are prior
in time than the plaintiff. The defendant has also to produce some original
samples of third parties user before the Court during the course of hearing.
Thus, the third parties user in the present case has become relevant factor to
decide the interim application.
64\. Admittedly, the marks used by the parties are not identical. The
plaintiff's grievance is confined to the use of the numeral 8 by the defendant
in respect of the beers which according to them has escalated its sales. I
have already arrived at the prima facie opinion that the numeral 8 has a role
to play in the liquor business which is being used by many third parties who
are denoting the strength. In these circumstances, the contention of the
plaintiff that there is sudden rise in the sales of the defendants beers due
to the usage of the numeral 8 is due to the popularity of the mark 8 PM of the
plaintiff prima facie cannot be accepted. I am doubtful whether such rise in
the sales is on account of the alleged popularity of the mark 8 PM of the
plaintiff or due to the CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.66 of 81 exhibition of the
strength of the beer which contains 8 % of the alcoholic content and
consequently, there is an increase in the consumption of the same. At this
prima facie stage, it can be safely said that it is for the plaintiff to prove
during the course of the trial the correctness of the said allegations in the
plaint that actually the rise in the sales of the defendant is directly
connected with the popularity of the mark 8PM or singularly 8 and the argument
cannot be accepted by mere saying of the plaintiff unless supported by the
documents.
65\. It is also note worthy to state that the mark 8PM is not registered in
respect of the beers by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is pressing for
injunction by putting reliance of 8PM in respect of whisky in Class 32 as well
as on the basis of registration in class 33 in relation to mineral water etc.,
which compels this court to go into the question of examining the similarity
of goods.
66\. The plaintiff has admitted during the hearing of the application that the
defendant is engaged only in manufacturing of ―Beer‖ and the Plaintiff has no
presence in the beer market, but according to the plaintiff, the nature, uses
and the users of the respective products of the parties are identical. The
respective goods of the parties received reach the market through the same
trade-channels. The products of the parties are being purchased by consumers
from all sectors of the society, including the uneducated, illiterate and
unwary customers. The would bound to be CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.67 of 81
deceived by the adoption/use of the impugned mark/numeral 8 by the Defendant.
The plaintiff has referred to few cases in support of its submission. The
following is the case which is heavily relied upon by the plaintiff :
>  United Breweries Limited and Anr. v. Balbir and Son (Agencies) and Anr. -
> 2005 (30) PTC 315 - Para ...
> "2. Respondent, M/s Balbir and Sons (Agencies), filed application No. 412036
> for registration of trade mark 'BALBI BLACK LABEL' in respect of liquors
> including brandy, whisky and gin and the same was advertised before
> acceptance in the Trade Marks Journal No. 974 dated 1.1.90 at page 1251.
> Appellant, M/s Kalyani Breweries Ltd., filed a notice of its intention to
> oppose the registration on 29.3.90 on the grounds that it is the registered

> 32 in respect of beer, but which in the course of trade is sold under the
> trade mark 'BLACK LABEL' and it is asked by, the customers as BLACK LABEL
> BEER. Thus, the word 'BLACK LABEL' has acquired a great reputation in the
> market for the appellant. Beer, though being in class 32 of the Fourth

> from the same counters and asked for by the same class of customers. Thus,
> both the products by the established use of the trade are bound to be

> Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the Act)."
> 3\. Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks took up the matter for hearing on
> 5.5.93. His conclusions are based upon the examination of the matter under
> Sections 11(a), 12(1) and 18(1) of the Act. In matter of his examination
> under Section 12(1) of the Act, he concluded:-
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.68 of 81
> (i) The prefixes in the mark 'KALYANI BLACK LABEL' and 'BALBI BLACK LABEL'
> being 'KALYANI' and 'BALBI' respectively, are distinct and dissimilar and
> the suffix 'BLACK LABEL' is identical and/or deceptively similar to each
> other and the prefixes being essential feature of the mark have greater
> significance and weight than all suffixes. Thus, the condition relating to
> the mark being identical with or deceptively similar to the similar mark
> registered in the name of a different proprietor is not satisfied;
> (ii) Appellant's goods are in respect of beer and the respondent's goods are
> in respect of liquor, including brandy. Hence rival goods are of the same
> description falling in different classes and thus, goods being similar, the
> condition relating to goods being of the same description under Section
> 12(1) of the Act is met. Thus, the impugned mark meets the requirements of

> 13......(emphasis supplied). We hold that the impugned mark is likely to

> disentitled under Section 12(1) of the Act since it pertains to the same

> appellant. Accordingly, for these reasons the impugned Order of the Deputy
> Registrar dated 30.9.93 is set aside and the appeal is allowed with no Order
> as to costs."
67\. It is also submitted by the plaintiff that the different classes of
criteria has no concern in an action for passing off if the confusion and
deception is apparent on the face of it. The plaintiff has referred the CS(OS)
No.1216/2011 Page No.69 of 81 case of Australian Wine Importers‟ Trademark -
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE - CHANCERY DIVISION (COURT OF APPEAL) - Page 316
at placitum 15-25, page 318 at placitum 35-45.
> "We find that they are goods which are generally sold by the same persons,
> and for the purposes of trade may, in some respects, be considered as the

68\. The goods more specifically beers and whisky are not identical and again
they are either same description of the goods or allied or cognates or
different. The judicial opinion in this respect is CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page
No.70 of 81 also not consistent as to whether the said goods are actually the
goods of the same description. It is noteworthy that the alcoholic drinks like
whisky wines, spirits are falling in class 32 and beers, water and other
aerated drinks are falling in class 33.
69\. Although I am aware that the classification is not material for measuring
the likelihood of confusion and deception. But the same cannot be completely
overlooked in the present circumstances. The ―alcoholic drinks‖ may be a very
wide classification wherein there may be goods including whisky, Rums,
spirits, wines, Jins of different price ranges. The same may also include the
drinks which are not purely alcoholic ones but are dilutions like beers which
contain the alcolohic content. If one may apply the test of identity of
composition, identity of consumers, price ranges, consuming public as tests,
the said goods seem to be goods of different description as composition wise
the beers and whisky are not the same, price wise, there is a great price
variation as beer may be cheaper and whisky may be expensive, consuming public
wise people are discerning as to whether they want beer or whisky.
70\. In Khoday Distilleries Limited (Now known as Khoday India Limited) vs.
Scotch Whisky Association and Others, reported in (2008) 10 Supreme Court
Cases 723. The relevant paras of the said judgment run as under:-
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.71 of 81
> "65. In Scotch Whisky Assn. v. Marton De Witt, the Federal Court of

However, applying the principles of passing off at this prima facie stage as
in my opinion, single numeral mark ‗8' is prima facie non distinctive and more
so when there is a nexus being found out in the trade of alcohols with respect
to numeral 8. The authorities on the subject also make the reference of
numeral 8 as requirement of the trade in alcohol business to denote the
strength of the beer. The plaintiff is also not the registered proprietor of
the numeral 8 and rather is registered of 8PM. Thus, unless the plaintiff is
exclusively registered for 8 per se, it cannot be said to enjoy the
proprietory rights over the part of the mark as per section 17 of the Act.
Prima facie, it appears that the numeral 8 cannot be exclusively enjoyed by
the plaintiff.
CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.74 of 81
The cases referred by the plaintiff have no bearing, as in all the cases, the
trade marks in question were not single letter mark and the defendants in
those cases have appropriated the entire mark of the plaintiff or used
deceptively similar mark in totality unlike a mere single letter.
71\. It is also argued by the plaintiff that the malafide intention of the
defendant is further corroborated by the fact that the defendant is also using
a slogan ―8 KA DUM‖ similar to that of the plaintiff's well-known campaign
―AATH KE THAATH‖. The defendant is also using the expression ―ROYALS‖
deliberately as ROYALE is part of the of the plaintiff's ―8 P.M‖ family of
marks. In support thereof, he referred the following cases:
> (a) Laxmikant Patel v. Chetanbhai shah (2002) 3 SCC 65 - Para 10 "The law
> does not permit any one to carry on his business in such a way as would
> persuade the customers or clients in believing that his goods or services
> belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does not
> matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise. The
> reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the
> basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts or
> intends to adopt a name in connection with his business or services which
> already belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has propensity
> of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself and
> thereby resulting in injury."
> In this case, the Apex Court further observed that:
> "Where there is probability of confusion in business, an CS(OS) No.1216/2011
> Page No.75 of 81 injunction will be granted even though the defendants
> adopted the name innocently."
> (b) Midas Hygiene v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors. 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC) - Para 5
> "The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears
> that the adoption of the Mark was itself dishonest."
72\. In order to establish his case on passing off, Mr. Kaul has argued that
the Defendant launched its brand PALONE/OKACIM PALONE in India in the year
2007. However, the said product turned out to be an unsuccessful one and not
get with the Indian market. Therefore, the Defendant in Jan- Feb, 2011
launched PALONE 8 which is alleged to be a super strong beer in India. Numeral
8 being used in a prominent manner and rather alleged success of the said
product i.e. sales turnover of around 26 crores from Jan, 2011 - April, 2011
shows the commercial potential of the numeral 8 and the malafide intention on
the part of the defendant, thus the plaintiff has been able to make out a
strong case of passing off.
The decisions relied upon by the plaintiff on the point of passing off are
distinguishable on the reason that in those cases, the courts had come to
conclusion that the trade marks in question were distinctive and even the
defendants had taken the whole trade marks of the plaintiffs. Even in the case
of B.K. Engineering (supra), the defendant was using the letter marks ‗B.K.
81', the entire mark of the CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.76 of 81 plaintiff
B.K. was appropriated by the defendant by just adding numerals 81 and they
were using the mark in relation to same goods, i.e. cycle bells. Similar is
the position of the case referred by the plaintiff, of Laxmikant Patel. In the
case of Midas Hygiene (supra), the defendant was using the same trade mark
Laxmanrekha with the similar packaging as that of the plaintiff. Therefore,
the Court had made the observation that the grant of injunction becomes
necessary. All the prevailing circumstances in the present case are missing.
73\. Let me also examine the argument that the sales of the defendants have
increased by user of the numeral 8. At this stage where I have already arrived
at the finding that the numeral 8 is usually used to denote strength or lager
in the beer. Further, there are number of the traders using the numeral 8 on
their product. It cannot be said with such certainty as to whether the sales
of the defendants have risen due to the infringement of the rights of the
plaintiff when the plaintiffs are not even in beers and not even registered in
beer or whether the said the rise of the sales is due to reason that the beer
which is sold of large strength and the same is made clear to the customer by
showing the same on the product. Thus, the said argument does not persuade me
much to believe that there is a case of passing off made out merely due to
rise in the sales of the defendant which may be incidental and is not directly
related to the infringement of the rights of the plaintiff. CS(OS)
No.1216/2011 Page No.77 of 81
74\. At this stage, it is for me to discuss the decision rendered by the
Division Bench of this court in the case of Rhizome Distilleries P. Ltd. &
Ors. vs. Pernod Richard S.A. France & Ors. 2010 (42) PTC 806 wherein the court
was concerned with the similar dispute relating to Alcohol industry wherein
the marks used were IMPERIAL BLUE and RHIZOME IMPERIAL GOLD and the court was
concerned with the part of the mark IMPERIAL which was full fledged word found
in the dictionary as against the prima facie weaker mark 8 and the Hon'ble
Division Bench observed thus:
> ―24. It is our analysis that no exclusive or proprietary rights can be
> claimed by either of the parties before us in respect of the word IMPERIAL
> which is not only in common parlance to be found in every dictionary, but
> also is laudatory in nature as it alludes to royalty or grandeur. With
> respect, we are not convinced that IMPERIAL refers only to royalty,
> empowering only such persons to take litigative umbrage. Illusions of
> royalty and grandeur are one of the sentiments resulting from imbibing
> spirits, and, therefore, IMPERIAL may justifiably be seen as descriptive.‖
> ―It may still be pleaded by the Plaintiffs that the Defendants are guilty of
> passing off because of the adoption of the word IMPERIAL. To this we may
> clarify that neither party has any exclusive right for the use of the word
> IMPERIAL. The two labels, that is IMPERIAL BLUE and RHIZOME Imperial Gold
> are totally dissimilar and if a flat amber bottle is used by the
> Defendants/Appellants, no deception is likely to arise. It is also relevant
> to mention that the word IMPERIAL is used by several other manufacturers of
> alcohol such as IMPERIAL TRIBUTE, IMPERIAL FAMOUS, TETLEY‟S IMPERIAL,
> IMPERIAL‟S HERO FIVE WHSKY, CAREW‟S IMPERIAL CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.78
> of 81 WHINE WHISKY, OLDIMPERIAL, SUMMERHILL IMPERIAL, XO IMPERIAL, DONFULANO
> IMPERIAL, RON BARCELO IMPERIAL ETC. All these parties will have to co-exist.
> In view of the widespread use of the word IMPERIAL, especially in the
> alcohol business, it is not possible to accept the contention of Mr. Chandra
> that the word IMPERIAL has attained a secondary meaning which would justify
> exclusivity. Moreover, secondary meaning would evolve over a number of

> 1997 and that is too short a period to make such an extreme claim. In this
> regard, it is also relevant that both the parties have received registration
> under the TM Act for their competing brands.‖
75\. The present case obviously is similar to the case referred above and
covers within the observations of the Pernod Ricard (supra), as there are
number of traders who are using the numeral-8 in respect of the alcohol drinks
and there are number of parties who have not and are securing the registration
of numeral-8. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to restrain the
defendant from using the numeral 8 due in view of the facts and circumstances
explained earlier. I am of the considered view that the defendant is not
liable to be restrained from using the mark numeral-8 completely as prayed by
the plaintiff in the injunction application, as the plaintiff has failed to
make out any prima facie case in its favour. The balance of convenience also
does not lie in favour of the plaintiff. The irreparable loss will be caused
to the defendant if they will be directed to not to use the numeral 8 when the
plaintiff is not CS(OS) No.1216/2011 Page No.79 of 81 even carrying on
business in beers. Thus, the present case do not warrant the grant of interim
injunction.
76\. However, I find some substance in the submission of the plaintiff about
its grievance that the defendant is using the mark-8 in similar writing style
and also in the golden colour which may be avoided. Thus, in order to avoid
any confusion, I direct the defendant to use the mark PALONE and numeral-8
together in the same line. The numeral-8 is allowed to be used by the
defendant in different writing style in different colour other than in golden
colour. This, I am directing this even to avoid any bleak chances of
misrepresentation. The mark ‗PALONE 8' would be used by the defendant in the
same size of lettering and fonts. The defendant is, however, granted time upto
31.12.2011 to make such changes and amendment in the packaging and
advertisement material as well as in slogan ―8 KA DUM‖ if used by the
defendant at present. The defendant shall also maintain true statement of
account for the aforementioned products and file the same in this case every
quarterly with an advance copy to the plaintiff. The defendant is allowed to
use the same as the manner mentioned above.
77\. Consequently I.A. No.8122/2011 is disposed of with the above said
directions. No order as to costs.
