permit fee or prospecting fee] royalty, surface rent or dead rent, as the case
may be, at the same rate at which it would have been payable under this Act,
if such 3[reconnaissance, prospecting or mining operations] had been
undertaken by a private person under a 4[reconnaissance permit, prospecting
licence or mining lease].
(4) The Central Government, with a view to enabling it to exercise the powers
conferred on it by sub-section (2) may, after consultation with the State
Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that no
4[reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease] shall be granted
in respect of any land specified in the notification.
1[17A. Reservation of area for purposes of conservation.—

be,] undertakes prospecting or mining operations in any area in which the
minerals vest in a private person, it shall be liable, to pay prospecting fee,
royalty, surface rent or dead rent, as the case may be, from time to time at
the same rate at which it would have been payable under this Act if such
prospecting or mining operations had been undertaken by a private person under
prospecting licence or mining lease.]
18. Mineral development.—
(1) It shall be the duty of the Central Government to take all such steps as
may be necessary 1[for the conservation and systematic development of minerals

1[18A. Power to authorise Geological Survey of India, etc., to make
investigation.—
(1) Where the Central Government is of opinion that for the conservation and
development of minerals in India, it is necessary to collect as precise
information as possible with regard to any mineral available in or under any
land in relation to which any prospecting licence or mining lease has been
granted, whether by the State Government or by any other person, the Central
Government may authorise the Geological Survey of India, or such other
authority or agency as it may specify in this behalf, to carry out such
detailed investigation for the purpose of obtaining such information as may be
necessary: Provided that in the cases of prospecting licences or mining leases
granted by a State Government, no such authorisation shall be made except
after consultation with the State Government.

lawful for the Geological Survey of India or the specified authority or
agency, and its servants and workmen—
(a) to enter upon such land,
(b) to dig or bore into the sub-soil,
(c) to do all other acts necessary to determine the extent of any mineral
available in or under such land,
(d) to set out boundaries of the land in which any mineral is expected to be
found,

tendered or as to the person to whom it should be paid or tendered, the
Central Government shall refer the dispute to the principal civil court of
original jurisdiction having jurisdiction over the land in question.
(4) The fact that there exists any such dispute as is referred to in sub-
section (3) shall not be a bar to the taking of any action under sub-section
(2).
(5) After the completion of the investigation, the Geological Survey of India
or the specified authority or agency by which the investigation was made shall
submit to the Central Government a detailed report indicating therein the
extent and nature of any mineral which lies deposited in or under the land.
(6) The costs of the investigation made under this section shall be borne by
the Central Government: Provided that where the State Government or other
person in whom the minerals are vested or the holder of any prospecting
licence or mining lease applies to the Central Government to furnish to it or
