                                  ORDER
PER R. K. PANDA, AM :
This appeal filed by the assessee is directed against the order dated
26.10.2012 passed by the Assessing Officer u/s 144C/143(3) of the I.T. Act,
1961 for the assessment year 2008-09.
2\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a Private Limited
Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 in June, 2004 and is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Helix Financial Group LLC. The assessee  2 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 company is engaged in the business of providing Information
Technology enabled back office process outsourcing and related services i.e.
ITES to its Associated Enterprise (AE), Helix US. The IT enabled back office
process outsourcing and related services performed by Blackrock India mainly
include web search, data entry, data management support services etc. The
assessee filed its return of income on 29.09.2008 declaring total income of
Rs.2,07,80,346/-. The Assessing Officer made a reference to the TPO for
determining the arm's length price u/s 92CA(3) in respect of the international
transaction entered into by the assessee during the financial year 2007-08
relevant to the impugned assessment year i.e. A.Y. 2008-09. During the TP
assessment proceedings, the TPO observed that the assessee during the impugned
assessment year has undertaken the following international transactions with
its AE as per the report in Form No.3CEB :-
          1)     Provision of IT enabled back office
                 process outstanding and related
                 service                                -     Rs.16,80,92,913/-
          2)     Reimbursement of expenses              -     Rs.1,17,837/-
3\. The TPO observed that as per the TP study report, the assessee undertook a
detailed functions, assets and risk analysis in accordance with Rule 10B(2)
and selected itself as the tested party based on its least complex character
while undertaking the international transactions with AEs. The assessee
selected  3 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 TNMM as the most appropriate method and
selected Operating Profit/Total Cost (OP/TC) as the relevant Profit Level
Indicator (PLI). The assessee took 5 comparables for its TP study and
determined the OP/TC of those comparables at 11.74%. After considering the
OP/TC of the assessee at 12.52%, it was argued that the international
transaction with its AE is at arm's length.
4\. However, the TPO was not satisfied with the explanation given by the
assessee. He observed that the assessee has selected some of the comparables
by considering the financial results for the period ending between 01.04.2006
and 31.06.2008. The earlier year's data was considered wherever the data was
not available for the relevant financial year 2007-08. Certain other defects
were also pointed out by the TPO as per page 3 of the order of the TPO.
Thereafter, the assessee conducted a fresh search and selected six comparables
with average profit margin @ 7.64% on cost. Since the margin earned by the
taxpayers was at 12.52% on operating cost, it was argued that the transactions
with its AE is at arm's length being within +/- 5% range.
5\. However, the TPO was again not satisfied with the arguments advanced by
the assessee and rejected the filters adopted by the assessee and went for
additional filters for the selection of comparables. The TPO, thereafter,
arrived at the set of 20 comparables and determined the arm's length price
margin at 29.16%, the details of which are as per page 98 of the order of the
TPO. After  4 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 granting benefit of working capital
adjustment to the assessee, the TPO reduced the operating margin by 3% and,
thereafter, made an upward adjustment of Rs.2,12,63,763/- to the total income
of the assessee, the details of which are given at page 136 of the order of
the TPO :-
"a. Computation of Arms Length Price:
The arithmetic mean of the Profit Level Indicators is taken as the arms length
margin. (Please see Annexure E for details of computation of PLI of the
comparables). Based on this, the arms length price of the IT enabled services
rendered by you is computed as under :
                  Arithmetic mean PLI                          :      29.16%
                  Less: Working Capital Adjustment             :      3.00%
                  Arm's Length Price:                          :      26.16%
           Operating Cost                                   Rs.150,092,483
           Arms Length Margin                               26.16% of the Operating Cost
           Arms Length Price (ALP)                          Rs.189,356,676
          b.     Price Received vis-Ã -vis the Arms Length Price:
The price charged by the tax payer to its Associated Enterprises is compared
to the Arms Length price as under :
Arms Length Price Rs.189,356,676 Price shown in the international transactions
Rs.168,092,913 Shortfall being adjustment u/s 92CA Rs.21,263,763 The above
shortfall of Rs.21,263,763 is treated as transfer pricing adjustment u/s
92CA."
6\. The Assessing Officer, thereafter, framed the draft assessment order
determining the total income of the assessee at Rs.4,20,44,109/- as against
returned income of Rs.2,07,80,346/-.
7\. The assessee filed its objections before the DRP, who vide order dated
03.09.12012 upheld most of the comparables taken by the TPO/Assessing  5 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 Officer. However, the DRP directed the TPO to exclude the
comparable namely Mold-Tek Technologies Ltd. for determination of the arm's
length price. The DRP also directed the Assessing Officer/TPO for exclusion of
foreign exchange gains/loss from the calculation of operating
income/expenditure of the assessee as well as the companies selected by the
TPO.
8\. Based on the directions of the DRP, the TPO issued a revised order dated
19.10.2012 re-computing the arm's length price at 22.46% after working capital
adjustment of 2.88%. The profit margin of comparable as computed by the TPO in
his revised TP order is as under :-

9\. Accordingly, the TPO made an upward adjustment of Rs.1,48,66,764/- as
against earlier proposed addition of Rs.2,12,63,763/-.
10\. Aggrieved with such order of the Assessing Officer, the assessee is in
appeal before the Tribunal by raising the following grounds of appeal :-
> "1. The assessment order passed by the Learned Assessing Officer ('Ld. AO')
> pursuant to the directions of Learned Dispute Resolution Panel ('Ld. DRP')
> based on the facts and in the circumstance of the case is bad in law and
> void ab-initio.
> 2\. The reference made by the Ld. AO suffers from jurisdictional error as
> the Ld. AO has not recorded any reasons in the assessment order based on
> which he reached the conclusion that it was 'necessary or expedient' to
> refer the matter to the Ld. TPO for computation of the Arm's Length Price
> ('ALP'), as is required under section 92CA(1) of the Act.
> 3\. The Ld. DRP and the Ld. AO (following the directions of the Ld. DRP),
> erred both on facts and in law in confirming the addition to the extent of
> Rs. 1,48,66,764 holding that the international transactions pertaining to
> provision of routine IT enabled services do not satisfy the arm's length
> principle envisaged under the Act and in doing so have grossly erred by:
> 3.1 not finding any merit in the objections of the Appellant that none of
> the conditions set out in section 92C(3) of the Act are satisfied in the
> present case;
> 3.2 rejecting the Transfer Pricing ('TP') documentation maintained by the
> Appellant under section 92D of the Act and Rule 10D of the Rules and
> disregarding the ALP as determined by the Appellant in the TP documentation;
> 3.3 disregarding the fact that the Appellant is a captive IT enabled service
> provider which does not bear substantial risks associated with its functions
> and therefore cannot be compared to full fledged entrepreneur service
> providers;
> 3-4 disregarding multiple year/prior years' data used by the Appellant in
> the TP documentation and holding that current year (i.e. Financial Year
> ('FY') 2007-08) data for comparable companies should be used  7 ITA
> No.6408/Del/2012 despite the fact that the same was not necessarily
> available to the Appellant at the time of preparing its TP documentation;
> 3.5 rejecting comparability analysis undertaken by the Appellant in the TP
> documentation/fresh search and conducting a fresh comparability analysis
> based on application of the following additional/revised filters in
> determining the ALP:
> (i) exclusion of companies whose data for FY 2007-08 was not available;
> (ii) exclusion of companies with related party transactions greater than 25%
> of their sales;
> (iii) exclusion of companies with export sales that are less than 25% of
> their total revenue;
> (iv) exclusion of companies with diminishing revenues/persistent losses for
> last three years up to and including FY 2007-08;
> (v) exclusion of companies having different financial year ending (i.e. not
> March 31, 2008);
> and rejecting, in particular, the following filters applied by the Appellant
> in its fresh search:
> (i) companies having other operating income (i.e. income other than
> manufacturing and trading income) to sales greater than 50% were accepted;
> (ii) companies having research & development costs to sales less than 3%
> were accepted;
> (iii) companies with net worth less than zero were rejected;
> (iv) companies having advertising, marketing and distribution costs to sales
> less than 3% were accepted.
3.6 including high-profit making companies with different scale of operations
and high turnover in the final comparables' set for benchmarking a captive
service provider such as the Appellant (disregarding judicial pronouncements
on the issue), thus demonstrating an intention to arrive at a pre-formulated
opinion without complete and adequate application of mind with the single-
minded intention of making an addition to the returned income of the
Appellant; 3.7 including ceratin companies that are not comparable to the
Appellant in terms of functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed;
3.8 including certain companies in the comparables' set that had achieved
supernormal growth as a result of extraordinary circumstances during the year,
thereby incorrectly comparing such companies to the Appellant which operates
as a captive services provider and has stable growth under normal
circumstances;  8
> ITA No.6408/Del/2012 3.9 resorting to arbitrary rejection of low-profit/
> loss making companies based on erroneous and inconsistent reasons;
> 3.10 excluding certain companies on arbitrary/ frivolous grounds even though
> they are comparable to the Appellant in terms of functions performed, assets
> employed and risks assumed;
> 3.11 ignoring the business/ commercial reality that since the Appellant is
> remunerated on an a cost plus basis, (i.e. it is compensated for all its
> operating costs plus a pre-agreed mark-up) the Appellant undertakes minimal
> business risks as against comparable companies that are full-fledged risk
> taking entrepreneurs, and by not allowing a risk adjustment to the Appellant
> on account of this fact; 3.12 collecting selective information of the
> companies by exercising power granted to him under section 133(6) of the Act
> that was not available to the Appellant in the public domain and relying on
> the same for comparability purposes (and to the extent of completely
> ignoring reliable data available in public domain/ annual reports in
> numerous cases); 3.13 exclusion of certain cost such as provision for
> doubtful debts from the cost base in computation of mark-up of comparable
> companies.
> 4\. The Ld. AO has grossly erred on facts and in law by initiating penalty
> under section 271(1)(c) of the Act mechanically and without recording any
> satisfaction for its initiation.
> 5\. The Ld. AO has grossly erred on facts and in law by proposing to compute
> interest under section 234A, 234B, 234C and 234D of the Act mechanically and
> without recording any satisfactory reasons for the same.
> 6\. The Ld. AO has grossly erred on facts and in law by disregarding
> judicial pronouncement in India in undertaking the TP adjustment. That the
> above grounds of appeal are without prejudicial to each other. The Appellant
> craves leave to alter, amend or withdraw all or any grounds herein or add
> any further grounds as may be considered necessary either before or during
> the hearing."
11\. Although a number of grounds have been raised by the assessee in the
grounds of appeal. Ld. counsel for the assessee confined his arguments to
grounds of appeal no.3.6 to 3.9 wherein the assessee has challenged the
selection of the following comparables :-
9
> ITA No.6408/Del/2012 S.No. Name of the company 1 Accentia Technologies Ltd.
             2     Coral Hub Ltd. (Vishal Information Technologies Ltd)
             3     Datamatics Financial Services Ltd. (Seg)
             4     Eclerx Services Ltd.
             5     Genesys International Corpn. Ltd.
             6     H C L Comnet Systems & Services Ltd. (Seg)
             7     Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg)
> 12\. So far as inclusion of Accentia Technologies Limited is concerned, ld.
counsel for the assessee submitted that the said company is functionally
different from that of the assessee company. He submitted that Accentia was
engaged in providing diversified services i.e. software development and IT
enabled services. The company's services and solutions are focused into two
areas i.e. Healthcare Receivables Cycle Management (HRCM) services, Training
Programs and development of software products. This company is engaged in
Transcription services which is considered as high end services (KPO). He
submitted that certain extraordinary circumstances occurred during the year.
Accentia has made major acquisitions during the year as well as it has
amalgamated its units with itself thereby making its profitability skewed. He
submitted that despite various submissions made before the DRP, there is no
specific direction by them. Referring to the following decisions he submitted
that Accentia Technologies Ltd. has been held as not a good comparable  10 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 because of different functions and extraordinary
circumstances that company occurred during the year :-
> a. BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl.CIT, (2017) 79 taxmann.com 85.
> b. IT Cube Solutions (P.) Ltd. vs. ITO, (2016) 76 taxmann.com 187.
> c. Avaya India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 71 taxmann.com 76.
> d. Flagstone Underwriting Support Services India (P.) Ltd. (2014) 52
> taxmann.com
> 408\.
13\. So far as inclusion of Coral Hub Limited (Formerly known as Vishal
Information Technologies Limited) is concerned, he submitted that the above
company is also functionally different from that of the assessee company. He
submitted that Coral Hub Limited is into data digitization, conversion and
publishing whereas the assessee's activity is with regard to provision of
routine outsourced business processes like finance and accounting,
collections, insurance, customer fulfillment, data modeling and analytics
support, etc. which is low-end in nature. Accordingly, Coral Hub Limited
cannot be included as it is not functionally comparable to the assessee's
business. He submitted that a perusal of the annual report of the company
shows that the company has significant payment towards vendors. The
intermediary functions of Coral Hub Limited can only be compared to that of a
distributor which takes title to service/ product for resale to the customer.
On the contrary the assessee is a  11 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 provider of back
office services on its own. Coral Hub Limited does not appear to be a service
provider at all but is more of distributor and hence, it is not comparable to
the assessee. For the above proposition, he relied on the following decisions
:-
> a. BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl.CIT, (2017) 79 taxmann.com 85.
> b. IT Cube Solutions (P.) Ltd. vs. ITO, (2016) 76 taxmann.com 187.
> c. Avaya India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 71 taxmann.com 76.
14\. So far as Datamatics Financial Services Limited is concerned, he
submitted that the said company is functionally different from that of the
assessee company, since Datamatics is acting as Registrar and share transfer
agent as well as providing ITES. Referring to page 150, 155 of the Annual
Report Compendium, he submitted there is no segment information available,
therefore, the revenues from both the streams are not separable. Relying on a
number of decisions, he submitted that when the segmental details are not
available, the company cannot be selected as a comparable. He accordingly
submitted that the Datamatics Financial Services Limited is included from the
list of comparable.
15\. So far as E Clerx Services Limited is concerned, he submitted that since
this company is engaged in providing data analytics and data process solutions
12 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 to the customers, therefore, it is functionally
different from that of the assessee company which is engaged in outsourced
business processes like technical support services, account management, etc.
For the above proposition, he referred to page 159, 163, 170, 201 of Annual
Report Compendium. Relying on the following decisions, he submitted that the E
Clerx Services Limited has been held to be as not a good comparable :-
> a. BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl.CIT, (2017) 79 taxmann.com 85.
> b. Avaya India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 71 taxmann.com 76.
> c. Flagstone Underwriting Support Services India (P.) Ltd. (2014) 52
> taxmann.com
> 408\. d. HSBC Electronic Data Processing India (P.) Ltd. vs. ACIT, (2015) 53
> taxmann.com 43.
> e. Goldman Sachs Services (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2015) 60 taxmann.com 310.
16\. So far as Genesys International Corporation Limited is concerned, he
submitted that the above comparable is functionally different from the
functions performed by the assessee under outsourced business processes like
finance and accounting, collections, insurance, customer fulfillment, data
modeling and analytics support, managed IT services, etc. He submitted that
the GIS services being provided by Genesys is more value added and high end in
nature than the outsourced service functions being performed by the assessee.
Relying on the  13 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 following decisions, he submitted that
Genesys International Corporation Limited cannot be considered as a comparable
:-
> a. BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl.CIT, (2017) 79 taxmann.com 85.
> b. Flagstone Underwriting Support Services India (P.) Ltd. (2014) 52
> taxmann.com
> 408\. c. HSBC Electronic Data Processing India (P.) Ltd. vs. ACIT, (2015) 53
> taxmann.com
> 43\.
17\. So far as HCL Comnet Systems and Services Limited is concerned, he
submitted that the above company is functionally different from that of the
assessee company. Referring to the Annual Report of the company, he submitted
that the relevant segment of the above company is into data centre management,
end user computing, managed security services, networking services and tools
and process consulting services etc. Referring to page 28 of the TPO's order,
he submitted that the TPO himself has rejected companies having financial year
ending other than 31st March, 2008. Since the financial year of HCL ends on
30th June, 2008, therefore, it fails the TPO's own filter of different
financial year. Relying on various decisions, he submitted that the above
company has been excluded from the list of comparables on account of its
functional difference as it is engaged in the business of providing
telecommunication and remote infrastructure management services.  14
ITA No.6408/Del/2012
18\. So far as Acropetal Technologies Limited (Engineering Design Service
Segment) is concerned, he submitted that this company is engaged in
development of software products whereas the assessee is doing ITES services
which cannot be compared with the software development companies. He further
submitted that as per information obtained u/s 133(6) by the Assessing
Officer, it has been replied by the said company that they provided
Engineering Design Services. Referring to Annual Report Compendium of
Acropetal Technologies Limited, copy of which is placed at page 104, 106, 107
of the Paper Book, he submitted that the ITES activity of the assessee are not
comparable to engineering services. Referring to the decision of the Hyderabad
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of HSBC Electronic Data Processing India
(P.) Ltd. (supra), he submitted that this company was excluded from the list
of comparable on account of differentiation of high end services being
provided by this company whereas the assessee is into low end service. He
accordingly submitted that the above company be excluded from the list of
comparables finally retained by the Assessing Officer.
19\. Ld. counsel for the assessee further drew the attention of the Bench to
certain factual/computation error while computing the arm's length margin. He
submitted that while computing the operating margin of Datamatics Financial
Services Ltd. (BPO division) the ld. TPO did not follow the directions issued
by  15 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 the DRP correctly and included foreign exchange
gain. Referring to the direction of the DRP at para 3.21 at page 26 of the
appeal set (page 13 of the DRP order), he drew the attention of the Bench to
the findings of the DRP and submitted that the TPO included foreign exchange
gain amounting to Rs.13,28,776/- and determined the profit margin of the
company at 34.87% as against correct profit margin at 29.11%. He submitted
that since there is an error on the part of the TPO in not following the
direction of the DRP, he may be directed to make correct computation of OP/TC
at 29.11% as against 34.87% determined by him.
20\. Ld. DR on the other hand strongly relied on the order of the TPO/DRP. He
submitted that since it is not possible to find out identical comparables,
therefore, the TPO has selected comparables which are more or less matching
with or very near to the activities carried out by the assessee company. He
submitted that the DRP after considering the various submissions made by the
assessee had retained these comparables and, therefore, no interference is
called for of the comparables retained by the DRP. He accordingly submitted
that the order of the DRP/Assessing Officer/TPO be upheld and the grounds
raised by the assessee should be dismissed.
21\. So far as the submissions of the ld. counsel for the assessee that the
TPO has not followed the direction of the DRP as per para 3.21 of the order of
the  16 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 DRP is concerned, he submitted that the DRP had
directed the TPO to keep the forex component out of the calculation of PLI in
both the case of the taxpayer and comparables. Therefore, he has no objection
if this issue is restored to the file of the TPO for making suitable
calculation.
22\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused
the orders of the Assessing Officer/TPO/DRP and the Paper Book filed on behalf
of the assessee. We have also considered the various decisions cited before
us. As mentioned earlier since the ld. counsel for the assessee confined his
arguments to certain comparables only apart from the computation error of
operating margin of Datamatics, therefore, we are straightway dealing with the
same only without going into the other grounds raised by the assessee in the
grounds of appeal which according to us are mere academic in nature.
23\. So far as exclusion/inclusion of Accentia Technologies Limited is
concerned, we find from the Annual Report Compendium that the company in its
annual report at page 29 has mentioned about the acquisition of Thunga
Software Pvt. Ltd., acquired GSR Physician's Billing Service, acquired GSR
systems, a software company specializing in HRCM based in Florida, USA,
acquired Denmed Inc., a medical transcription company based in salem, Oregon,
USA. Further, this company is engaged in providing diversified  17 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 services. This company is engaged in transcription services
which is considered as a high end service (KPO).
24\. We find the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of BA Continuum
India (P.) Ltd. (supra) has excluded Accentia Technologies Limited on account
of extraordinary events that took place in this company. The Pune Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of IT Cube Solutions (P.) Ltd. (supra) has also excluded
Accentia Technologies Limited from the list of comparables on account of
extraordinary events that have taken place. Similar view has been taken by the
various Bench of the Tribunal. Since it is an admitted fact that extraordinary
events have taken place during the year in case of Accentia Technologies
Limited, therefore, we are of the considered opinion that this company cannot
be held as a comparable with that of the assessee company on account of
different functions as well as extraordinary events such as acquisitions that
have taken place. We, therefore, direct the TPO/Assessing Officer to exclude
this company from the list of comparables.
25\. So far as Coral Hub Limited is concerned, we find from the Annual Report
Compendium of the above company, copy of which is placed at page 354 to 374 of
the Paper Book that this company is into data digitization, conversion and
publishing whereas the activities of the assessee company is with regard to
the provision of routine outsourced business processes like  18 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 finance and accounting, collection, insurance, customer
fulfillment, data modeling and analytics support, etc., which is low-end in
nature. Further, we observe from page 84 of the Annual Report (page 336 of the
Annual Report Compendium) that this company has made significant payment
towards vendors. Thus, intermediary functions of this company can only be
compared to that of a distributor which takes title to service/ products for
resale to the customers. However, the assessee company is a provider of back
office services on its own. We, therefore, find merit in the argument of the
ld. counsel for the assessee that this company should be excluded from the
list of comparables.
26\. We find the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of BA Continuum
India (P.) Ltd. (supra) has excluded this company from the list of comparables
by observing as under :-
> "11.3. We have considered the rival contentions and perused the orders
> relied on. As far as this comparable is concerned, the same has been decided
> by the Co-ordinate Bench of Delhi in the case of United Health Group
> Information Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT [ITA No.6312/Del/2012-AY 2008-09]
> dt. 28-08-2014, wherein the Co-ordinate Bench held as under:
> "Vishal Informatics 12.1. The TPO included this company in the list of
> comparables by noticing that it was engaged in providing BPO services. The
> assessee failed to convince him and the DRP that it was incomparable.
> 12.2. Having heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material
> on record, we find from the Annual report of this company that it is mainly
> engaged in e-publishing business. It has more than 10,000 classic books to
> its credit which are also converted into large font titles for visually
> challenged. Apart from e-publishing, this company is also engaged in
> Documents scanning & Indexing. It can be seen from the financial results of
> this company that both the segments viz., e- publishing and Documents
> scanning etc. have been  19 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 combined and there are no
> separate financial results in respect of Documents scanning work, which may
> be comparable with the assessee to some extent. As the assessee is not
> engaged in any e-publishing business and the financials given by this
> company are on consolidated basis, we direct to exclude this company from
> the list of comparables. The assessee succeeds".
> 11.4. Respectfully following the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench, we
> direct the AO/TPO to exclude Coral Hub Limited (Formerly known as Vishal
> Information Technologies Limited) from the list of comparables."
27\. We find the Pune Bench of the Tribunal in the case of IT Cube Solutions
(P.) Ltd. (supra) has excluded Coral Hub Limited from the list of comparables
on the ground that the Coral's work is substantially outsourced and thus
business module has acquired a different character on the touchstone of FAR
analysis. The various other decisions relied on by the ld. counsel for the
assessee also support its case. In view of above and considering the fact that
this company is functionally different from that of the assessee company and
it has significant outsourcing of work, we direct exclusion of Coral Hub
Limited from the list of comparables.
28\. So far as Datamatics Financial Services Limited is concerned, we find
this company is acting as Registrar and share transfer agent as well as ITES.
There is no segmental information available in the audited accounts.
Therefore, the revenues from both the streams are not separable. It has been
held in various decisions that when segmental details are not available, the
company cannot be accepted as a comparable. Since admittedly in the instant
case no  20 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 segmental details are available, therefore,
we direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude Datamatics Financial Services
Limited from the list of comparables.
29\. So far as E Clerx Services Limited is concerned, we find this company is
engaged in providing data analytics and data process solutions to the
customers which in our opinion are functionally different from the functions
performed by the assessee under outsourced business processes like technical
support services, account management, etc.. We find the Delhi Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of Avaya India (P.) Ltd. (supra) following the decision
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
vs. CIT in ITA No.102/2015 order dated 10.08.2015 has held that E Clerx
Services Limited and Coral Hub Limited (Vishal Information Technologies
Limited) being high-end service providers cannot be compared with low-end
service provider. Similar view has also been taken by the Hyderabad Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. (supra) on the ground
that this company is classified as high-end KPO and was having supernormal
profit. The Bangalore Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Goldman Sachs
Services (P.) Ltd. (supra) has also excluded this company from the list of
comparables on account of the said company being mainly engaged in providing
high-end KPO services involving specialized expertise in the field and the
same cannot be compared with company mainly engaged in providing low-end
services to its group  21 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 concerns. Since the assessee in
the instant case is a low-end service provider, therefore, following the
decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Avaya India (P.)
Ltd. (supra) and the various decisions citied (supra), we hold that the E
Clerx Services Limited cannot be held as comparable with that of the assessee
company. The various other decisions relied on by the ld. counsel for the
assessee in the synopsis also support its case. We, therefore, direct the
exclusion of E Clerx Services Limited from the list of comparables.
30\. So far as Genesys International Corporation Limited is concerned, we find
this company also is functionally different from that of the functions of the
assessee company. From the annual report of the company, we find it is engaged
in the business of providing Geographical Information Services comprising
Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing, Cartography, Data Conversion services etc..
Further, as per the decision of the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of BA Continuum India (P.) Ltd. (supra), we find there was abnormal
growth of around 605.43% for its Geospatial services for the financial year
2007-08. We find after considering the arguments advanced by the assessee, the
Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal excluded the Genesys International Corporation
Limited from the list of comparables by observing as under :-
22
> ITA No.6408/Del/2012 "14.2. We have considered the rival contentions and
> perused the orders relied on. As far as this comparable is concerned, the
> same has been decided by the Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Hyundai Motors
> India Engineering P. Ltd., Vs. ITO in ITA No. 1850/Hyd/2012 (AY. 2008-09)
> dt. 21-02-2014, wherein the Co- ordinate Bench held as under:
> "V. GENESYS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION LTD.
> This company is listed at Sl. No.11 in the list of comparable companies
> chosen by the TPO. As far as this company is concerned, the stand of the
> assessee has been that this company is functionally not comparable and that
> it has a different employee skill set and that this company performs R&D
> services and also owns intangibles. This company is a geospatial services
> content provider specialising in land based technologies. From the notes to
> accounts of this company, it is seen that this company is engaged in
> providing geographical information services comprising of photogrammetry,
> remote sensing cartography, data conversion related computed based services
> and other related services. Further the business of this company requires
> skilled manpower and scientists, civil engineers, etc. Besides the above,
> this company also carries out R&D services and own intangibles. The
> aforesaid facts, in our view, will take this company out of the list of
> comparables. Similar view was also taken in the case of Symphony Marketing
> Solutions India(p) Ltd (supra) by the Bangalore Bench. In view of the above,
> we are of the view that this company cannot be regarded as a comparable and
> deserves to be excluded from the list of comparables".
> 14.3. Respectfully following the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench, we
> direct the AO/TPO to exclude Genesys International Corporation Ltd., from
> the list of comparables."
31\. Similar view has been taken by the various other decisions relied on by
the ld. counsel for the assessee in the synopsis. We, therefore, direct the
TPO/Assessing Officer to exclude Genesys International Corporation Limited
from the list of comparable on account of functionally different.
32\. So far as HCL Comnet Systems and Services Limited is concerned, we find
this company is into data centre management, end user computing,  23 ITA
No.6408/Del/2012 managed security services, networking services and tools and
process consulting services which in our opinion is functionally different
from that of the assessee company. We find the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal
in the case of HSBC Electronic Data Processing India (P.) Ltd. (supra) has
restored the issue to the file of the TPO with the following direction :-
> "14.6.2. We have heard rival submissions of the parties and perused the
> material on record. It is not disputed that these companies are having huge
> turnovers like that of assessee during the year. Therefore turnover filter
> as considered in other cases does not apply here. However as submitted the
> functional profile of companies as such is different. But, if the BPO
> division is similar to assessee the same can be considered after proper FAR
> analysis. Therefore we are of the opinion that TPO/AO can reconsider the
> comparables after giving due opportunity to assess and fairly analyzing its
> objections. In case the data (segmental or unit) is incomplete or functional
> profile etc are different AO/TPO should exclude the same. With these
> observations the issue of selection of these companies as comparables is
> restored to TPO/AO to do the needful."
33\. We, therefore, restore this issue to the file of the TPO with the
direction to re-adjudicate the issue in the light of the direction of the
Tribunal cited (supra). Needless to say, the TPO shall given due opportunity
of being heard to the assessee as per fact and law.
34\. So far as Acropetal Technologies Limited is concerned, we find this
company is engaged in development of software products, whereas assessee is
doing ITES services which in our opinion cannot be compared with software
development company. From the notes of account, copy of which is placed at  24
ITA No.6408/Del/2012 page 104 of the Paper Book, we find this company is
engaged in development of computer software. We find the Hyderabad Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of HSBC Electronic Data Processing India (P.) Ltd.
(supra) has excluded this company from the list of comparables by observing as
under :-
> "14.2.1 This company is listed at Sl.No.2 of the comparables chosen by the
> TPO. As far as this company is concerned, the objection of the assessee is
> that this company is not functionally comparable. The assessee is a BPO
> company that provides CAD/ CAE services. As far as Acropetal Technologies
> Ltd. is concerned, this company does the business of export of software

> 15 to the notes on accounts to Annual Report for 07-08) that it derives

> It is also pertinent to point out that before the TPO, the assessee raised

36\. So far as factual/computation error while computing the arm's length
margin in the case of Datamatics Financial Services Ltd. is concerned, we find
the DRP at para 3.21 of the order has directed the TPO to keep the forex
component out of the calculation of PLI in both the cases of the taxpayer and
comparables. Ld. counsel for the assessee at the time of hearing has filed the
following chart for the proposition that the correct computation of OP/TC is
29.11% as against 34.87% computed by the TPO :-
                      Particulars              Amount [As per revised       Correct
                                                 order of TPO dated      Computation (Rs.)

           Add: Foreign Exchange gain         1,328,776
           Operating Income                   61,925,019                 60,596,243
           Total Expenditure                  129,539,089                129,539,089

37\. We, therefore, restore this issue to the file of the TPO/Assessing
Officer with direction to verify the above and adopt the correct OP/TC in case
of  26 ITA No.6408/Del/2012 Datamatics Financial Services (BPO Division). The
grounds raised by the assessee are accordingly allowed in the terms indicated
above.
38\. Since, we have confined our decision to only grounds of appeal no.3.6 to
3.9, therefore, the other grounds which were not argued by the ld. counsel for
the assessee are dismissed as being not pressed.
39\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.

                                  ORDER
PER R. K. PANDA, AM :
This appeal filed by the assessee is directed against the order dated
26.10.2012 passed by the Assessing Officer u/s 144C/143(3) of the I.T. Act,
1961 for the assessment year 2008-09.
2\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a Private Limited
Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 in June, 2004 and is a
