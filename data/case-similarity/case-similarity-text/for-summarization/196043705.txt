This writ petition, styled as a Public Interest Litigation, is filed by the
petitioner/party-in-person praying for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus
directing the respondents to replace the image of temple and rearrange the
National Flag to its correct specification of 3:2 ratio rectangle in the
emblem of Government of Tamil Nadu.
2\. The petitioner, in the affidavit filed in support of this writ petition,
avers that he is an ex-serviceman rendering full time Gandhian Service to the
nation and had filed cases regarding Constitutional violations and insults to
national honour. The petitioner claims that acting on his representation, the
motto Satyameva Jayate has been included in the mini replica of the State
Emblem used on the car of his Excellency, The President of India and the
Ministry of Defence has also acted on his representation and rectified the
error by adding Satyameva Jayate in its flags, logos, badges, caps etc. The
petitioner would further state that he has noticed that two national flags
have been inscribed in the emblem of Government of Tamil Nadu and both the
national flags have been mutilated inward and thereby violating the provisions
of Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. It is stated by the
petitioner that the shape of the national flags should be horizontal and
rectangle ratio of 3:2 as prescribed in the Flag Code of India, 2002 and in
this regard, he submitted a representation dated 28.08.2012 to the second
respondent requesting for rearrangement of the national flags in accordance
with the Flag Code of India, 2002. However, the second respondent has sent
replies dated 08.04.2013 and 26.04.2013 stating that the matter has been
closed at the Governmental level.
3\. It is the contention of the writ petitioner that temple tower inscribed in
the State emblem of the Government of Tamil Nadu, being a Hindu religious
symbol, cannot be used for the reason that it gives out an impression that the
Government of Tamil Nadu is supporting or propagating a particular religion
and therefore, came forward to file this writ petition.
4\. The petitioner/party-in-person made his submissions on the basis of the
above said averments made in the affidavit filed in support of this writ
petition and also submitted that in any event, the second respondent at least
provided an opportunity of personal hearing to him and instead, has sent very
vague replies without assigning any reasons and hence, prays for appropriate
orders.
5\. In the State emblem of Government of Tamil Nadu, temple tower is inscribed
in it and according to the writ petitioner, the said inscription is the temple
tower of Arulmighu Andal Temple at Srivilliputhur and it represents place of
worship of a particular religion which gives out an impression that the
Government of Tamil Nadu is propagating/supporting a particular religion. In
the State emblem of Government of Tamil Nadu, temple tower is inscribed. It is
a well known act that the State of Tamil Nadu is known as Land of Temples.
The inscription of temple tower found in the State emblem, cannot lead to any
presumption that the Government of Tamil Nadu is supporting a particular
religion. Temple tower is an ancient one and designed and constructed on
scientific basis. It is pertinent to point out at this juncture that temple
tower of Lord Bragatheeswara Temple at Tanjore is very famous and an
archeological wonder and people from all over the world visit Tanjore to see
that magnificent edifice and similarly, there are also many more temple towers
including the one at Srirangam. It cannot lead to the inference that when a
person sees any archeological wonder including the temple tower, only think of
the God or the presiding diety in the said temple, but the person concerned
only sees the scientific and technological expertise gone into for such
construction, even in ancient times.
6\. The question whether the said inscription represents a religious symbol,
depends upon individual perception and the mind and attitude of that
particular person. In the decision in M.P.Gopalakrishnan Nair v. State of
Kerala [(2005) 11 SCC 45], it has been held as follows:
"22. The word Hindu is not defined. A Hindu admittedly may or may not be a
person professing Hindu religion or a believer in temple worship. A Hindu has
a right to choose his own method of worship. He may or may not visit a temple.
He may have a political compulsion not to openly proclaim that he believes in
temple worship but if the submission of the appellants is accepted in a given
situation, the 1978 Act itself would be rendered unworkable. Idol worships,
rituals and ceremonials may not be practised by a person although he may
profess Hindu religion.
23\. A five-Judge Bench of the Kerala High Court in Krishnan [1979 KLT 350] in
para 40 of its judgment noticed: (KLT pp. 376-77) It is well known that there
are sections of Hindus whose schools of thought and philosophy do not consider
idol worship, rituals and ceremonials as necessary or even conducive to the
spiritual progress of man. There are also political creeds or social theories
which openly condemn such forms of worship as being based on mere superstition
and ignorance. Many persons, who are born Hindus and who may be said to
profess Hinduism solely because they have not openly renounced the Hindu faith
by any recognised process, may ardently believe in such political or social
ideologies which do not view temple worship with favour.
24\. The legislature has not chosen to qualify the word Hindu in any manner.
The meaning of the word is plain and who is a Hindu is well known. The
legislature was well aware that Hindu is a comprehensive expression (as the
religion itself is) giving the widest freedom to people of all hues, opinions,
philosophies and beliefs to come within its fold."
Even as per the said decision, Hindu is a comprehensive expression giving
the widest freedom to people of all hues, opinions, philosophies and beliefs
to come within its fold.
7\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the decision in S.R.Bommai v. Union
of India [(1994) 3 SCC 1 (Constitution Bench)] held that not only the State is
prohibited to establish any religion of its own, but it is prohibited further
to identify itself with or favouring any particular religion because the State
is enjoined to accord equal treatment to all religions and religious sects of
denominations, without any preference in favour of or discrimination against
any of them. It has been further held that in a secular state, the existence
of a legal right or public duty does not depend upon the profession or
practice of any particular religion and the State attempts to secure the good
of all citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs or practices. It has
been further observed in the said decision that Securalism is one of the basic
features of the Constitution. While freedom of religion is guaranteed to all
persons in India, from the point of view of the State, the religion, faith or
belief of a person is immaterial. To the State, all are equal and are entitled
to be treated equally. In matters of State, religion has no place. Secularism
is thus more than a passive attitude to religious tolerance and it is a
positive concept of equal treatment to all religions.
8\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Ziyauddin Burhanuddin Bukhari v.
Brijmohan Ramdass Mehra and Others [(1976) 2 SCC 17], has considered the scope
and purpose of Section 123(2), (3) and 3(A) of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951 with regard to corrupt practices i.e., undue influence,
religious appeal and promoting feeling of enmity and while deciding the case,
has considered the meaning of "Secular" and held as follows:
"The term "secular" is used to distinguish all that is done in this world
without seeking the intervention or favour of or propitiating a Superhuman or
Divine Power or Being from that which is done professedly to please or to
carry out the will of the Divinity. Secularism, in the realm of Philosophy, is
a system of utilitarian ethics, seeking to maximise human happiness or welfare
quite independently of what may be either religious or the occult.
The secular State, rising above all differences of religion, attempts to
secure the good all its citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs and
practices. It is neutral or impartial in extending its benefits to citizens of
all castes or creeds. Such a State has to ensure, through its laws, that the
existence or exercise of a political or civil right or the right or capacity
to occupy any office or position under it or to perform any public duty
connected with it does not depend upon the profession of practice of any
particular religion...."
9\. Admittedly, no finger has been raised with regard to any preference by the
Government of Tamil Nadu in favour of any particular religion. It is also a
practice/custom to greet the people belonging to a particular religion as and
when any festival falls in connection with that religion and leaders as well
as persons belonging to political parties also used to greet them on those
occasions. Therefore, it cannot be said that since the emblem of Government of
Tamil Nadu is having a temple tower inscribed in it and the said emblem being
the tower of the temple, the Government of Tamil Nadu is giving preference or
encouraging a particular religion.
10\. Insofar as the National Flag appearing in the emblem of Government of
Tamil Nadu is concerned, this Court is of the considered view that none of the
provisions of The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and
Flag Code of India, 2002, have been violated. The provisions of the above said
Act are regulatory in nature and impose only reasonable restrictions. The Flag
Code of India, 2002 contains the executive instructions of the Central
Government and cannot be termed as a Law, but at the same time, restrictions
under Flag Code are to be followed as far as they preserve dignity of the
National Flag as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Union of India v. Naveen Jindal [(2004) 2 SCC 510].
11\. In the State emblem of the Government of Tamil Nadu, the national flag
finds a prominent place. Insofar as the stand taken by the petitioner/party-
in-person that the ratio of length and breadth to the width of the flag has
been violated in the State emblem, this Court is of the considered view that
it is applicable if the national flag is displayed. This Court is also of the
view that respect and dignity of the national flag has been preserved in the
State emblem and therefore, it cannot be said that the said display is against
the provisions of the above said Act and the Flag Code.
12\. This Court finds no merit in this writ petition and hence, it is
dismissed. However, in the circumstances of the case, there shall be no order
as to costs.
