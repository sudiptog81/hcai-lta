                                        ORDER
PER SHRI B.R BASKARAN, ACCOUNTANT MEMBER The assessee has filed this appeal
challenging the assessment order passed by the AO for assessment year 2013-14
u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 144C of the Act in pursuance of directions given by the Ld
Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP).
2\. Ground No.1 is general in nature. At the time of hearing, the Ld A.R did
not press ground No.4. The ground no.2 and 3 relate to IT(TP)A
No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 2 of 12 the Transfer pricing adjustment of Rs.580.00
lakhs made by the TPO. The assessee has also raised two additional grounds
seeking consequential relief in pursuance of order passed for assessment year
2012-13.
3\. The assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of
enclosures, heat exchangers, industrial cooling equipment and power
distribution equipment.
4\. We shall first take up the grounds relating to T.P adjustments. The Ld A.R
submitted that the assessee has adopted TNMM method for benchmarking its
international transactions and adopted Operating cash Profit/Operating Revenue
(OP/OR) as Profit level indicator (PLI). In this appeal, the assessee is
disputing exclusion of one comparable named Schneider Electric President
Systems Ltd (Formerly called APW President Systems Ltd) and is also disputing
inclusion of following two comparable companies:-
(a) Lloyd Elecrtric & Engg Ltd
(b) Universal Heat Exchangers Ltd.
5\. With regard to exclusion of M/s Schneider Electric President Systems Ltd,
the Ld A.R submitted that the TPO has excluded the same only for the reason
that it is a consistently loss making company. The Ld A.R submitted that the
assessee has compared the Cash profit ( i.e., excluding depreciation) earned
by it with the cash profit earned by the comparable companies. The Ld A.R
submitted that the M/s Schneider Electric President Systems Ltd has actually
made cash profit during the year ending 31.3.2011 and 31.3.2015 to 31.3.2017.
It has incurred cash loss only during IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 3 of 12
the year ending 31.3.2012 to 31.3.2014. Accordingly, the Ld A.R contended that
this company cannot be considered as consistently loss making company.
6\. On the contrary, the Ld D.R submitted that the year under consideration is
AY 2013-14 and hence the financial results subsequent to the year under
consideration should not be considered.
7\. We heard rival contentions and perused the record. We notice that the TPO
has excluded this company only for the reason that it is consistently loss
making company. We notice that the Ld DRP has not discussed/decided on this
comparable. In any case, it is the contention of the assessee that only cash
profit should be compared. The assessee has also furnished a statement showing
cash profit/loss of this company for the year ending 31.3.2011 to 31.3.2017.
We notice that this company has earned cash profit during the year ending
31.3.2011 and incurred loss during the year ending 31.3.12 and 31.3.13. Before
us, the Ld D.R contended that the operational results of the years subsequent
to the year under consideration should not be taken into account. We agree
with the said contentions of Ld D.R. Accordingly, we are of the view that the
financial results of this company for the year ending 31.3.2013 and earlier
years alone should be examined in order to decide the question as to whether
this is consistently loss making company or not?
IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 4 of 12
8\. The Ld A.R placed his reliance on the decision rendered by Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors vs. DCIT (376 ITR
183)(Delhi) and contended that the loss making companies should not be
excluded, unless it was shown that the loss has been incurred due to abnormal
circumstances. The Ld A.R invited our attention paragraph 29 of the order,
wherein the guidelines issued by OECD (more particularly paragraph 3.65 of
OECD guidelines) are extracted. He also took support of the decision rendered
by the co-ordinate bench in the case of Trilogy E- business software India P
Ltd vs. DCIT (2013)(23 ITR (Trib)
464)(Bang-ITAT).
9\. We notice that the co-ordinate bench in the above said case has expressed
the view that there is no bar in considering companies with either abnormal
profits or abnormal losses as comparable to the tested party, as long as they
are functionally comparable. It was further held that it is for the assessee
to demonstrate existence of abnormal factors which would warrant exclusion of
the same. The Mumbai bench of Tribunal has also held in the case of Capgemini
India P Ltd vs. ACIT (2013)(27 ITR (Trib.) 74 (Mum-ITAT) that comparables
should not be rejected merely on account of high profit or loss.
10\. In the instant case, the TPO has rejected M/s Schneider Electric
President Systems Ltd only for the reason that it was consistently making
losses. What is required to be shown by the TPO, as per the view taken by the
above cited cases, is that there existed abnormal conditions which has
resulted in losses in the IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 5 of 12 hands of M/s
Schneider Electric President Systems Ltd, which would warrant exclusion of the
same. Accordingly, we are of the view that this comparable requires fresh
examination at the end of AO/TPO. In any case, the Ld DRP has not discussed
about this comparable. Accordingly we set aside the order passed by the AO on
this comparable and restore the same to his file to examine it afresh.
11\. With regard to the contention of the assessee that the cash profit
(profit before depreciation) should be considered as PLI, we notice that the
same finds support from the decision rendered by the co-ordinate bench in the
case of DCIT vs. M/s Centum Rakon India P Ltd (IT(TP)A No.472/Bang/2016 dated
20-07-2018), wherein the co-ordinate bench has followed the decisions rendered
in the case of Honeywell Technology Solutions Lab vs. DCIT (61 SOT
61)(URO)(Bang.); 24/7 Customer.com (P) Ltd vs. Dy CIT (2013)(140 ITD 344) and
BA Continum India P Ltd vs. ACIT (2013)(28 ITR (Trib.) 445 (Hyd). We notice
that the co-ordinate bench has expressed the view that the profit before
depreciation can be taken as PLI, if there is substantial variation in the
manner of charging depreciation by the assessee and comparable companies.
Accordingly we direct the AO to take into consideration the above said
contention of the assessee also. We also direct the assessee to furnish the
details to prove that there is substantial variation in the manner of charging
depreciation.
12\. The Ld A.R also submitted that the AO/TPO has not given the methodology
of computation of Operating Profit/Operating IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 6
of 12 Revenue. We are of the view that there is merit in the said prayer of
the assessee. Unless the manner of computation of OR/OC is given, it may not
be possible for the assessee to explain the mistakes/variation in the
computation. Accordingly we direct the AO to confront the workings of OP/OR
with the assessee before taking any decision.
13\. We shall now examine the claim of the assessee for exclusion of two
comparables selected by the TPO. The first comparable is M/s Lloyd Electrical
and Engineering Ltd. The Ld A.R submitted that the total turnover of the
assessee company is around Rs.300 crores, out of which the turnover relating
to Cooling units & accessories is only around Rs.25.44 crores. He further
submitted that the turnover of M/s Lloyd Electrical and Engineering Ltd is
around 1169 crores, out of which the turnover of Air conditioners division is
around 823 crores. Accordingly he submitted that the turnover Air-conditioner
division of M/s Lloyds is more than 10 times of the turnover of the assessee
from Cooling units division. By Placing reliance on the decision rendered by
Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of Acusis Software India (P) Ltd vs.
ITO (2018)(98 taxmann.com 183)(Kar), the Ld A.R submitted that the above said
comparable would fail the turnover filter of 1 to 10 times of turnover of the
assessee.
14\. He further submitted that the cooling units manufactured by the assessee
are for industrial purposes and hence the same cannot be compared with the
comfort Air-conditioners manufactured by M/s Lloyds Electrical and Engineering
Ltd. He further submitted IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 7 of 12 that the
above said company has not given segmental results for various divisions. He
further submitted that there was a demerger of heat exchange business in
April, 2011. He submitted that the appointed date for de-merger was April,
2011 and the effective date was determined as June, 2013. Accordingly he
submitted that the Ld DRP was not justified in holding that the de-merger
shall have impact only from June, 2013 and accordingly rejecting this
contention of the assessee. Accordingly he submitted that this comparable
should be directed to be excluded.
15\. We heard Ld D.R and perused the record. The business profile of the
assessee company is stated as "manufacture and sale of Enclosures, Heat
exchangers, Industrial cooling equipment and power distribution equipment. We
notice that the business profile of M/s Lloyd Electric and Engineering Ltd has
been discussed as under in the Management discussion & analysis (page 235 of
paper book):-
> "Lloyd Electric & Engineering Ltd is an established diversified engineering
> corporation with a history in business excellence. It is an acknowledged
> name in Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC&R)
> industry and Consumer Durable goods segment. Lloyd is a leading manufacturer
> of heat exchanger and evaporator coils serving the entire spectrum of HVAC&R
> industry. The company is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to major
> AC giants in India and exporters to leading brands in the rapidly growing
> markets of Africa and Middle East. The company also provides customised AC
> solutions for institutional clients like IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 8
> of 12 railways, defense and metro rails and has also sustained in the
> transport segment. Lloyd is a premier name in the airconditioning and
> consumer durables goods segment. Your company has further expanded its
> horizons by acquiring the Heat Exchanger business of Perfect Radiators and
> Oil Coolers Private Ltd pursuant to the approval of scheme of Arrangement by
> the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and Rajasthan thereby adding significant
> value by integrating and consolidating the Heat Exchanger business of Lloyd
> globally. The extensive product range of Heat Exchanger business includes
> copper and brass heat exchangers, shell & tube heat exchanger for industrial
> application, oil coolers for railways, and heavy automobile and tube mill
> for MB radiators for its existing and new customers."
From the perusal of the business profile of M/s Lloyds Electric & Engineering
Ltd, we notice that the air-conditioning business does not confine to comfort
air conditioners as projected by Ld A.R. Hence we reject the said contentions
of ld A.R.
16\. The Ld A.R further submitted that there was an extra- ordinary event of
de-merger. However, we notice that M/s Lloyds Electric & Engineering Ltd has
acquired two companies viz., M/s Perfect Radiators and M/s Oil Coolers P Ltd,
i.e., it has merged two companies with itself and hence there was no de-merger
as projected by Ld A.R. We also notice that the merger has taken place with
effect from 01-04-2011. Hence the extra-ordinary event can be attributed to FY
2011-12 pertaining to AY 2012-13 only. We IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 9 of
12 are concerned with AY 2013-14 and hence no extra-ordinary event has taken
place during the year under consideration.
17\. The Ld A.R submitted that M/s Lloyd Electric & Engineering Ltd does not
have "Enclosures business" and hence the turnover of "Air-conditioning"
segment alone should be compared. Accordingly he submitted that the turnover
of Air-conditioner business of M/s Lloyds is more than 10 times of the
turnover of the assessee from cooling units. First of all, it was not shown to
us that the "Enclosure business" is not related to Air-conditioning or Cooling
units of the assessee. The nature of "Enclosure business" was not explained
anywhere. If the "Enclosures" are used for Cooling systems/heat management
systems, in our view, the same should be considered as part and parcel of
Cooling units business of the assessee. Hence, there is lack of clarity on
this aspect and accordingly we are unable to appreciate the contentions of Ld
A.R in this regard. If the assessee is able to show that the Enclosures
business is not related to the activity of Heat management systems, then there
may be merit in the contentions of the assessee. In view of the lack of
clarity, we are of the view that this contention of the assessee requires
fresh examination. The question of applying turnover filter would arise only
if it is shown that the Enclosures business is altogether different from heat
management systems. Accordingly we restore this issue to the file of AO/TPO
for examining this claim of the assessee in accordance with law by duly
considering the discussions made supra.
18\. The next comparable, which the assessee seeks to be excluded, is M/s
Universal Heat Exchangers Ltd. The ld A.R IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 10
of 12 submitted that the turnover of this company included turnover from
"fabricated items" and the same constituted about 40% of the total turnover.
Further, there was no segmental results available and hence the profit from
"Heat exchangers and Oil coolers" could not be ascertained for the purpose of
comparing the same with the assessee company. He submitted that the Ld DRP has
retained this comparable without citing any reason.
19\. We heard Ld D.R and perused the record. From the perusal of the turnover
details given by M/s Universal Heat Exchangers Ltd in page 307 of the paper
book, we notice that the turnover from Fabricated items constitute 40% of the
total turnover of the above said company. We notice that the assessee has not
furnished the copies of Directors report, management discussion etc of this
company. Hence the meaning attributed to "fabricated items" by M/s Universal
Heat Exchangers Ltd could not be appreciated. The terminology "fabricated
items" is a generalised one and it may not be correct to presume that the same
does not relate to the "heat management system". In the absence of specific
details as to what is meant by "fabricated items", we are unable to appreciate
the contentions of the assessee. As discussed by us in the preceding
paragraphs while dealing with the case of "enclosures", what is required to be
examined is as to whether the "fabricated items" are related to the "heat
management system" or not. If it is related, then this comparable should be
considered for the purpose of T.P analysis. Otherwise it may be excluded. In
view of lack of clarity, we are of the view that this comparable also requires
fresh examination. Accordingly we restore this comparable also to the file
IT(TP)A No.2494/Bang/2017  Page 11 of 12 of AO/TPO for examining it afresh by
duly taking into account the meaning of "fabricated items" mentioned by this
comparable.
20\. The assessee has taken two additional grounds. The Ld A.R submitted that
the decision rendered by the Tribunal for assessment year 2012-13 in respect
of two issues, viz., "raw material in transit" and "stock obsolescence" shall
have consequential effect in the present assessment year under consideration.
Accordingly he prayed that the AO may be directed to take into account the
consequential effects. We find merit in the prayer of the assessee.
Accordingly we direct the AO to take into account the consequential effect in
respect of above said two issues during the year under consideration.
21\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is treated as partly allowed
for statistical purposes.
