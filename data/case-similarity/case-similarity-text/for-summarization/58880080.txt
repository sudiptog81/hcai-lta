    *    IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI
                                            Pronounced on: 06.05.2019
    +      CS(COMM) 1031/2018
           LIFESTYLE EQUITIES C.V. & ORS.            ..... Plaintiffs
                         Through    Mr.J.Sai Deepak, Ms.Sangeeta Goel,
                                    Mr.Mohit Goel, Mr.Sidhant Goel,
                                    Mr.Aditya Goel, Mr.Ashutosh Nagar
                                    and Mr.Deepankar Mishra, Advs.
                              versus
           ROYAL COUNTY OF BERKSHIRE
           POLO CLUB LTD. & ORS.               ..... Defendants
                        Through  Mr.Sudhir Chandra, Sr.Adv. with
                                 Mr.Peeyoosh Kalra, Mr.C.A.Brijesh,
                                 Ms.Shreyosi Pal and Ms.Navya
                                 Chopra, Advs.for D-1.
                                 Dr.Sheetal Vohra and Mr.Sridharan
hence is using the phrase Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, the learned
counsel for the plaintiffs had clearly stated that here was no objection to
the name being used by the defendants, namely, Royal County of Berkshire, Polo
Club. What is being objected to is the logo mark being used by the defendants
which is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs.
21\. There is no merit in the said pleas of learned senior counsel for the
defendants. Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. Balance of
convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs inasmuch as the defendants had
started use of the impugned trade mark in May, 2018 whereas the plaintiffs had
filed the suit in July, 2018. At the initial stage when the matter was heard
on 23.07.2018 injunction was not granted to the plaintiffs as a submission had
been made by the defendants in court that the mark being used by the
defendants is a registered device in India whereas actually there was no
registration under class 3 in favour of the defendants.
22\. Accordingly, the defendants, its agents, affiliates, distributors etc.
are restrained from selling or dealing or advertising any product which uses
                                 Dr.Sheetal Vohra and Mr.Sridharan
                                 Ram Kumar,Advs. for D-2 & D-3.

IA No.9511/2018
1\. This application is filed by the plaintiffs under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2
CPC seeking an interim injunction to restrain the defendants etc.from selling,
advertising, offering for sale, directly or indirectly, reproducing the
infringing logo mark or any other mark/trade mark/logo/device which is
identical and deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs logo mark.
CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 1 of 26
2\. The accompanying suit is filed for permanent injunction, restraining
infringement of Trademarks, Copyright, passing off, dilution of goodwill,
unfair competition, rendition of accounts of profits/damages, delivery, etc.
The plaintiffs seeks a decree of permanent injunction to restrain the
defendants etc. from selling, offering for sale advertising, directly or
indirectly dealing or reproducing or using in any manner whatsoever the
infringing logo mark or any other trade mark or logo/device, which is
identical to and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ well known Logo
Mark amounting to infringement of the plaintiffs‟ registered trade marks.
Other connected reliefs are also sought.
3\. It is the case of the plaintiffs that plaintiff No.1 is a Dutch Limited
Partnership and Proprietor of the well known and inherently distinctive
trademark Beverly Hills Polo Club (hereinafter referred to as „BHPC‟) and
other variants of these marks. It is pleaded that the business under the BHPC
brand alongwith the plaintiff‟s logo mark was established in 1982. The
plaintiffs commenced business under the BHPC brand in India in 2007. It is
pleaded that the plaintiffs‟ logo mark is an invented and an inherently
distinctive trademark which constitutes an essential feature of the
plaintiffs‟ overall branding of all the products sold by the plaintiffs. It is
pleaded that the composite use of the distinctive Polo Player Device and the
distinctive word mark "Beverly Hills Polo Club" written in a stylized manner
with other artistic elements, branding features and colour combinations makes
the CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 2 of 26 plantiff‟s logo mark unique and highly
artistic/distinctive. It is pleaded that the Polo Player Device contained in
the plaintiffs‟ logo mark is an essential and distinctive feature of the
plaintiffs‟ logo mark. It is further pleaded that the brand right from its
adoption and use was successful in the United States of America and has
rapidly emerged as a global brand which is positioned as a premium brand. It
is pleaded that due to extensive, continuous and uninterrupted use, now
spanning over 36 years globally and over a decade in India the plaintiffs‟
logo mark is synonymous with high standards of quality in respect of products
provided by the plaintiffs.
As far as the fragrance section is concerned the plaintiffs commenced sale of
fragrance products bearing the plaintiffs‟ logo mark and the plaintiffs‟ trade
dress in the year 2012. From the said date the plaintiffs have been openly,
extensively and continuously using the said logo mark and trade dress in India
on the entire range of products offered around the world. It is pleaded that
the plaintiffs‟ range bears a unique, distinctive and catchy trade dress which
immediately creates a brand recall.
4\. It has been stated that the plaintiff No.1 is the registered proprietor of
the plaintiffs‟ logo mark in India under the Trademarks Act in various classes
including class 3 which specifically covers fragrance products such as
deodorants, perfumes amongst others. The different details of the registration
of the trademarks are given in para 19 of the plaint. It is also stated that
the plaintiffs are the exclusive proprietors of the artistic and distinctive
trade dress of their fragrance products. The sale turnover attributable to
business in India alone, for the last two financial years it is pleaded is
approximately about Rs.400 crores with the promotional expenses being around
Rs.5.6 crores for the said two years. It is stated that the CS (COMM.)
1031/2018 Page 3 of 26 trademarks and artistic works of the plaintiffs enjoy
unparallel goodwill and reputation in the work and has acquired the status of
well-known marks within the meaning of section 2(1)(zg) of the Trademarks Act
and are entitled to be protected as such.
5\. Regarding the defendants it is stated that defendant No.1 according to
information available with the plaintiffs is a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the United Kingdom and is in the business of sale
of fragrance, apparel products, accessories such as belts, watches etc. under
the brand "Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club", which is used in conjunction
with the infringing logo mark. Defendant No.2 is believed to be engaged in the
business of manufacturing, marketing and distribution of fragrances and
perfumes. Defendant No.2 is also in management/stake holder of an ex licensee
of the plaintiffs‟ brand, namely, Air-Val, International S.A. The license was
terminated in 2011. However, litigation took place between the plaintiffs and
Air-Val, International S.A. Defendant No.2 hence it is pleaded has complete
knowledge of the plaintiffs‟ various trademarks, trade dress, logo mark.
Defendant No.3 said to be a company existing under the laws of India and is
also engaged in the business of contracts, manufacturing of fragrances and
perfumes. It is an entity which has taken up the responsibility of
manufacturing the infringing fragrance products of defendant No.1 under the
infringing logo mark and infringing trade dress in India. It was also in the
past a shareholder of the company Beverly Hills Polo Club Fragrances Pvt.
Limited which was incorporated in the year 2012 for the purpose of manufacture
and sale of fragrance products under the plaintiffs‟ brand. Because of their
past association with the plaintiffs they have been contracted by defendants.
CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 4 of 26
6\. It is pleaded that sometimes in May 2018 the plaintiffs learnt about the
launch of identical fragrance products by defendant No.1 in collaboration with
other defendants under the infringing logo mark and infringing trade dress in
India. It is pleaded that on a perusal of the plaintiffs‟ logo mark and the
infringing logo mark it is apparent that the infringing logo mark is an
imitation and is visually and structurally identical/deceptively similar to
the plaintiffs‟ logo mark. The infringing logo mark contains an
identical/deceptively similar Polo Player Device as contained in the
plaintiffs‟ logo mark in the same arrangement. The two marks of the plaintiffs
and the defendant are as follows:-
Plaintiffs Defendants
7\. Similarly, it is pleaded that a perusal of the plaintiffs‟ trade dress on
its fragrance products and the defendants infringing trade dress on their
fragrance products when compared as a whole clearly reveal that the trade
dress of the defendants is an imitation of and conceptually and visually CS
(COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 5 of 26 identical/deceptively similar to the
plaintiffs‟ trade dress. The infringing trade dress of the defendants contains
identical/deceptively similar get up, colour combination arrangement of
features figures/characters, logo, device amongst others.

                   Women‟s Collection                Women‟s Collection
8\. It is pleaded that defendant No.1 has no excuse whatsoever or reason to
adopt such a logo and trade dress. It is clear that the same is a dishonest
adoption and the act of the defendant would cause confusion in the minds of an
unwary customer who would buy the fragrance thinking it to be originating from
the plaintiffs. The act of the defendants is purely to deceive the consumers
and to piggyback on the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs.
9\. Defendant No.1 in the written statement has denied the above pleas of the
plaintiffs. It has been pleaded that defendant No.1‟s mark and trade dress of
fragrance products are not identical or deceptively similar. It is stated that
the mark has to be taken as a whole and no one can claim rights over part of a
trade mark. Hence, the plaintiffs do not have any registration of any part of
the composite mark such as a polo player, horse, polo player on a horse back,
club mallet. It is further stated that the device of a polo player on a horse
back per se is common to the trade and to claim exclusivity on the same is
absurd and illogical. It is further stated that the user of the defendants is
bona fide.
CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 7 of 26
It is also pleaded that defendant No.1‟s mark indicates its complete trade
name, i.e. Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club. It is a well known polo club
in UK with its date of establishment dating back to the year 1985. HRH The
Prince of Wales opened the club as its first member. It is further stated that
defendant No.1 has been using the said marks uninterruptedly for more than 30
years internationally.
It has also been pleaded that there is a „polo player on a horse back‟ device
under registration in class 3 registered in the name of Polo/Lauren Company
L.P. since 1987. The „polo player on horse back‟ device was adopted by the
Polo Ralph Lauren in the year 1967. Hence, the plaintiffs are nothing but
copycats and pirates of the well known trademark Polo/Lauren Company LP.
Hence, it is pleaded that the device of a „polo player on a horse back‟ is
common to trade. Similarity of trade dress is also being denied.
10\. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the
plaintiffs has submitted as follows:-
(i) The defendants‟ infringing logo mark and infringing trade dress when
compared as a whole appear to be nothing but a slavish imitation of the
Beverly Hills Polo Club logo mark and trade dress of the defendants. The
manner and use of numerals, the use of colour combinations and identical
placement of infringing logo mark clearly show that the defendants are guilty
of infringement under section 29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 passing off and
unfair competition.
(ii) It is settled law as laid down by the Supreme Court of India in Amrit
Dhara Pharmacy vs. Satyadeo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449 that the overall impression
or any similarity of the mark have to be seen and the court is not CS (COMM.)
1031/2018 Page 8 of 26 to undertake a side by side comparison and disconcur
the dissimilarities to enquire as to whether the mark used by the defendants
is deceptively similar or identical to that of the plaintiffs‟ mark. It is
pleaded that if in this case the court were to compare the two logo mark and
the trade dress as a whole it would be clear that the impugned trademark and
trade dress are deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs.
(iii) Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Division Bench of this
court in United Biotech Private Limited vs. Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals
Ltd. & Ors. ILR (2012) V Delhi 325 to submit that the essential features of a
composite trademark are protected by registration of the composite mark.
Hence, the polo player device being an essential feature need not separately
be registered for protection of the plaintiffs‟ registered logo mark.
(iv) It is further stated that on 23.7.2018 when the matter came up before
this court for hearing the defendant stalled an injunction order being passed
by submitting that their infringing logo mark is registered in India. It
turned out that this infringing logo mark was not registered in India for
Fragrance products. Their application is pending and has been opposed by the
plaintiffs.
(v) Reliance is also sought to be placed on an order passed by the Second
Board of Appeal in case R. 1374/2012-2, dated 25.07.2013 between the parties
titled Lifestyle Equities CV vs. Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club Limited
which dealt with an application filed by the defendants herein which sought to
register its trade device under various classes. The order went on to record
that the signs in issue are having visual, phonetic and conceptual
similarities and are identical in nature with respect to the goods concerned.
CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 9 of 26
11\. Learned senior counsel for the defendants has stated as follows:-
(i) It is pleaded that horse is a common feature in a lot of marks as it
portrays strength and beauty. Plaintiffs cannot claim exclusivity to a horse
device. It has also stated that the plaintiffs are mere pirates. Their device
is a copy of the device used by Ralph Lauren and Denver.
(ii) It is pleaded that the device, namely, a polo player on a horse is juris
publici. Plaintiffs cannot claim any exclusive use of a polo playing player.
(iii) Further, it has been pleaded that there are various differences in the
device used by the plaintiffs and the defendants. The figures of the horse are
different. The defendant‟s horse is only half a horse. The font used is
different. The writing appears at a different place. Reliance is placed on
section 35 of the Trademarks Act, 1999.
(iv) It is further pleaded that the defendants are a prestigious polo club in
England. Prince Charles is also a member of the Club. Whereas the plaintiffs
are not a polo club. Being a polo club the defendant is entitled to use the
device of polo playing player.
(v) It is reiterated that what is registered is the full logo and not the
figure of the horse. A false representation is being made that the figure of
the horse is registered. Use of the horse would not amount to deceptive
similarity. Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in Intex
Technologies (India) Ltd. and Ors. vs. AZ Tech (India) and Ors. 2017 (70) PTC
118. Similarly, it is stated that the trade dress is different.
(vi) It is also pleaded that the use by the defendant of the impugned device
is bona fide and has started two years ago.
12\. The first issue that arises is as to whether the trademark used by the
defendants are deceptively similar to the registered mark of the plaintiffs.
In CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 10 of 26 this context, reference may be had to
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73 where the Supreme Court held as
follows:-
> 16\. ......It is important that the marks must be compared as wholes. It is
> not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of
> the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other
> case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is
> whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it is likely to
> cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of persons accustomed
> to the existing trade mark. Thus in Lavroma case Lord Johnston said:
> we are not bound to scan the words as we would in a question of comparatio
> literarum. It is not a matter for microscopic inspection, but to be taken
> from the general and even casual point of view of a customer walking into a
> shop."
> On the facts of that case this Court came to the conclusion that taking into
> account all circumstances the words Protovit and Dropovit were so dissimilar
> that there was no reasonable probability of confusion between the words
> either from visual or phonetic point of view.
> xxx
> 19\. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of phonetic
> similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words
> are written is different and the conclusion so arrived at is clearly
> contrary to the binding precedent of this Court in Amritdharas case (supra)
> where the phonetic similarity was applied by judging the two competing
> marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Sharmas case (supra), it was observed that:
> In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that
> the use of the defendants mark is likely to deceive, but where the
> similarity between the CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 11 of 26 plaintiffs and the
> defendants mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and
> the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
> evidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights are violated."
> 13\. Reference may also be had to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
> case of Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, (supra). That was a case in
> which the respondent had applied for registration of the trade name
> „Lakshmandhara‟. The appellant stated that the word „Amritdhara‟ was already
> registered as a trade name and filed its objections. The Supreme Court held
> as follows:
> "7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our
> consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names 'Amritdhara'
> and 'Lakshmandhara' are in use in respect of the same description of goods,
> namely, a medicinal preparation for the alleviation of various ailments.
> Such medicinal preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of
> going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick alleviation of
> their suffering, both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as
> illiterate. As we said in Corn Products Refining v. Shangrila Food Products
> Ltd. [1960]1SCR968 , the question has to be approached from the point of

> man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names
> 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara' is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or
> cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two
> composite words 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara'. We do not think that the
> learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would

> even consider meanings of the composite words as 'current of nectar' or
> 'current of CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 12 of 26 Lakshman'. He would go more
> by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the

> of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation
> which he wants for his ailments.
> 8\. We agree that the use of the word 'dhara' which literally means 'current
> or stream' is not by itself decisive of the matter. What we have to consider
> here is the overall similarity of the composite words, having regard to the
> circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations
> of the same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to

> Farwell, CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 13 of 26 J. said in William Bailey
> (Birmingham) Ltd.'s Application (1935) 52 R.P.C. 137 :
> "I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a
> part of the other word; one word must be considered as a whole and compared
> with the other word as a whole,....... I think it is a dangerous method to
> adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a
> portion of the other work".
> 9\. Nor do we think that the High Court was right in thinking that the

> 14\. The Supreme Court in Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. vs. Arvindbhai
> Rambhai Patel and Others, (2006) 8 SCC 726 held as follows:-
> "91. Although the defendant may not be using the actual trade mark of the
> plaintiff, the get-up of the defendant's goods may be so much like the

> (See Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engg. Co. [(1969) 2 SCC 727] )"
> 15\. Similarly, reference may also be had to the judgment of the Division
> Bench of this court in the case of United Biotech Pvt. Ltd. v. Orchid
> Chemicals Ltd. & Ors. (supra). In that case, the Division Bench was dealing
> with a case where the appellant had got registration of the trade mark

IPAB allowed the rectification of the application with the direction to
Registrar of the Trademarks to remove the trade mark FORZID belonging to the
appellant from the register. In those facts the Division Bench held as
follows:
> "22. The argument was that as per sub-Section (1) of Section 17 of the Act,
> the exclusive right of the registered proprietor is to use the trademark
> "taken as a whole" and not "in part" which the respondent was trying to

> registration would not confer any right in the matter forming only art of
> the whole of the trade mark was registered and the IPAB had ignored the
> words "not" and "in" occurring in this petition thereby committing a grave
> error. Relying upon the judgment in the case of Aravind Laboratories Vs.
> Modicare (decided on 05.07.2011), which is a Single Bench judgment of the
> Madras High Court. It was argued that the objects & reasons behind insertion
> of Section of the Trade Mark Act, 1999 were to omit the provision relating
> to requirement of disclaimer under Section 17 of the Trade and Merchandise
> Marks Act, 1958 and to explicitly state the general proposition that the
> registration of CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 15 of 26 a trade mark confers
> exclusive right to the use of the trade mark taken as a whole and not
> separately to each of its constituent part. To buttress this submission,
> reference was made to Section 15 of the Act which permits a proprietor of a
> trade mark to apply for parts of a trade mark, if he claims to be entitled
> to the exclusive use of any part thereof separately. It was argued that
> since this was not done by the respondent in the instant case, it was
> permissible for the respondent to claim statutory right in the word "ORZID"
> (perse)......
> .......
> 25\. The entire arguments are on the wrong premise and it proceeds on the
> basis of common feature of the two marks suffix "ZID" and since the
> respondent has registration and trade mark "ORZID", it cannot bare a part of
> it, i.e., "ZID". What has been seen in a case like this is as to whether the
> mark "FORZID" is deceptively similar to "ORZID". That is the test which is

> "ORZID" is an essential feature which has been covered by the registration.
> Therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent appears to be right in his

> 82\. In Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd. (supra), whereupon reliance has been

> 181] to CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 16 of 26 say that where a distinctive

15\. The plea of the defendants that the plaintiffs cannot claim exclusively
the polo player device is misplaced. There can be no dispute that the polo
player device is an essential and significant feature of the mark of the
plaintiffs. The defendants have used a device that is deceptively similar to
the essential features of the plaintiff‟s logo mark.
16\. Regarding the trade dress the relevant comparison of the trade dress is
as follows:-
      Plaintiffs' Fragrance Product          Defendants' Impugned Product
                              Images of Rival Trade Dress
      Men‟s Collection                     Men‟s Collection
    CS (COMM.) 1031/2018                                          Page 23 of 26
       Women‟s Collection                        Women‟s Collection
17\. It would be wrong to say that there are striking similarities in the
impugned trade dress used by the defendants when compared to the trade dress
used by the plaintiffs. The colour combinations used are different.
CS (COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 24 of 26
Merely because the length and circumference of the bottle has some commonality
would not per se prima facie manifest that an average consumer would get
confused by looking at the trade dress. Hence, it is not possible to grant any
relief to the plaintiffs on the plea that there is a commonality of the trade
dress being used by the defendants.
18\. I may also deal with the submissions of learned senior counsel for the
defendant. First, it has been pleaded that a horse device is publici juris and
the plaintiffs are pirates and have copied the features from Ralph Lauren and
Denver. In my opinion, the plea is misplaced. Ralph Lauren and Denver has not
in any manner objected to the use of the said device/the concerned logo mark
by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have been using the mark since 1982. The mark
has also been used in the fragrance sector since 2012. Pursuant to an
application filed in 1992 the mark was registered in class 25. It is also
registered in class 3,9,18 and 24 pursuant to an application filed in 2006.
There are more than a dozen such registrations in favour of the plaintiffs.
The defendants themselves have applied for registration of the impugned logo
mark with the polo player device. There is no merit in the said plea of the
learned senior counsel for the defendants.
19\. The next argument raised was about difference in the figures of the
horse, difference of font being used. The plea is again misplaced as noted by
me above. It is quite clear that the device being used by the defendants is
structurely similar to that of the plaintiffs. What is sought to be protected
is an essential and prominent feature of the mark. A comparison of the two
marks would make it manifest that the mark of the defendants is deceptively
similar to that of the plaintiffs and relates to the same goods. It is likely
to cause confusion. The mark of the defendants as a whole is deceptively CS
(COMM.) 1031/2018 Page 25 of 26 similar to the mark of the plaintiffs. The
polo player device is an essential feature of the label mark of the plaintiffs
and cannot be separated and compared separately as sought to be urged.
20\. Regarding the fact that the defendant No.1 is a prestigious polo club and
hence is using the phrase Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, the learned
counsel for the plaintiffs had clearly stated that here was no objection to
the name being used by the defendants, namely, Royal County of Berkshire, Polo
Club. What is being objected to is the logo mark being used by the defendants
which is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs.
21\. There is no merit in the said pleas of learned senior counsel for the
defendants. Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. Balance of
convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs inasmuch as the defendants had
started use of the impugned trade mark in May, 2018 whereas the plaintiffs had
filed the suit in July, 2018. At the initial stage when the matter was heard
on 23.07.2018 injunction was not granted to the plaintiffs as a submission had
been made by the defendants in court that the mark being used by the
defendants is a registered device in India whereas actually there was no
registration under class 3 in favour of the defendants.
22\. Accordingly, the defendants, its agents, affiliates, distributors etc.
are restrained from selling or dealing or advertising any product which uses
the impugned logo mark which is currently being used by the defendants or any
other mark which is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ logo mark.
23\. This application is disposed of, as above.
