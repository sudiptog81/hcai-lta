The Agreements dated 22nd September, 1999, and 10th March, 2003, merely
mention the Tripartite Agreement dated 11 th September, 2009, in the form of
recital. Thus by no stretch of imagination one can say that as envisaged by
Section 7 (5) of the Act, the reference to the said Agreements dated 22 nd
September, 1999, and 10th March, 2003, in the Agreement dated 11 th September,
2009, is such as to make the arbitration clauses contained therein part of the
                          ARBITRATION APPLICATION NO. 86 OF 2013
           (In its jurisdiction under Section 11 of the  Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

3\. The brief facts in the matter are as under:
3.1 Maharashtra Area and Housing Development Authority (MHADA) is the original
owner of Survey No. 139, City Survey No. 1319 (Part) admeasuring 8892 sq.
mtrs. situate, lying and being at Versova Link Road, Taluka Andheri,
(hereinafter referred to as "the said property") which is declared as slum
under the provisions of the Maharashtra Slum Act, more particularly described
in Exhibit-A to the Plaint in Suit No. 62 of 2013.
        3.2       By an Indenture of Lease dated 31 st March, 1993, MHADA  had leased 
                                                       3/23
                                                                            ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 :::
         KPPNair                                     4                        NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013
the said property to one Andheri Kamgar Nagar Co-operative Housing Society
Ltd. ("Society") consisting of members of slum dwellers who were in occupation
of the said property.
3.3 Thereafter by a Development Agreement dated 6th October, 1996, executed by
and between the Society on the one hand and Aurora on the other hand, the
Society inter alia granted development rights in respect of the said property,
on the terms and conditions more particularly set out therein, to Aurora. By
the said Agreement dated 6th October, 1996, Aurora was entitled to assign the
benefits of the said Development Agreement to any other party.
3.4 Aurora completed part construction of the rehabilitation building on the
said property. Thereafter by and under a Sub-Development Agreement dated 22nd
September, 1999, Aurora as the Developer therein, transferred and assigned its
rights under the Development Agreement dated 6 th October, 1996 to BSRCL,
described therein as the "Sub-Developer", on terms and conditions more
particularly set out therein. It was specifically recorded in the said
Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999, that BSRCL would be liable to give
15,000 sq.ft. of free sale area as per SRA sanctioned plan to Aurora. Aurora
had also obtained the consent of the Society for the execution of the said
Sub-
Development Agreement. Clause 36 of the said Sub-Development Agreement dated
22nd September, 1999 between Aurora and BSRCL provides as under:
"The parties hereto hereby agree that in the event of their being any dispute
and/or disagreement by and between the parties  4/23 ::: Downloaded on -
04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 5 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 hereto in
respect of interpretation of any of the terms and conditions herein contained
as also in respect of any matter arising out of and/or touching these
presents, the same shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Indian
Arbitration and Reconciliation Act, 1996. The decision of the Arbitrator
Tribunal shall be final and binding".
3.5 According to Aurora, while the development work was going on in the said
property, Aurora was shocked and surprised to come across a public notice
dated 9th December 2005, wherein it was stated that an Agreement had been
executed by and between BSRCL and Samir on 10 th March, 2003 and therefore the
development rights in respect of the said property were claimed by Samir.
According to Aurora, upon making further enquiries, Aurora for the first time
in December, 2005, came to know that a Development Agreement dated 10th March,
2003, had been executed by BSRCL with Samir. The said Agreement was executed
without taking consent of Aurora purporting to transfer the development rights
of BSRCL in favour of Samir. However, it was recorded in the Development
Agreement dated 10 th March, 2003, that BSRCL would be liable to give 15000
sq.ft. free sale area as per SRA sanctioned plan to Aurora as was agreed by
and between Aurora and BSRCL under the Sub-
Development Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999. BSRCL's obligation under the
said Sub-Development Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999 was specifically
acknowledged and reiterated in the said Agreement dated 10 th March, 2003.
Clause 31 of the said Agreement contains a clause relating to  5/23 :::
Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 6 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF
2013 Arbitration Agreement between BSRCL and Samir. The same is reproduced
hereunder.
> "31. It is agreed between the parties hereto that any dispute or differences
> which may arise between the parties hereto as to performance or non-
> performance or terms of performance or validity, termination, abandonment or
> cancellation of this Agreement for Development and interpretation of the
> terms of this Agreement for Development and all questions which may arise

> or its amendment or re-enactment thereof as the case may be and the venue of
> Arbitration shall be at Mumbai."
3.6 After series of correspondence exchanged between the parties, negotiations
and settlement talks ensued which finally culminated in a Tripartite Agreement
in the form of a letter dated 11 th September, 2009. The said letter dated
11th September, 2009, was addressed by Aurora to BSRCL and confirmed by Samir.
It was agreed that Aurora would receive 22500 sq.ft.
of constructed area as per SRA sanctioned plan and proportionate car parking
area out of the 45 per cent share of BSRCL. Admittedly, there is no clause in
the said Tripartite letter/Agreement containing an arbitration agreement
between the parties.
        3.7        In July, 2012, Aurora wrote letters to BSRCL and Samir stating that 
                                                      6/23
                                                                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 :::
         KPPNair                                  7                        NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013
Aurora is entitled to its 22500 sq.ft. constructed area as per the sanctioned
plan from the 45 per cent area of BSRCL. However, Aurora did not receive its
said share and in fact learnt in November, 2012, that an Occupation
Certificate is received in respect of the free sale building by BSRCL and
Samir on or about 9th January, 2012 and though BSRCL and Samir were required
to give notice to Aurora calling upon Aurora to take possession of the
constructed area, BSRCL as well as Samir did not give any such notice to
Aurora.
3.8 Aurora (as Plaintiff) therefore on 21 st November, 2012, filed the above
Suit No. 62 of 2013 against BSRCL (as Defendant No.1) and Samir (as Defendant
No.2) inter alia seeking specific performance of the Sub-
Development Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999 executed by and between
Aurora and BSRCL read with the Tripartite Agreement dated 11 th September,
2009 including handing over to Aurora the constructed area of 22500 sq.ft. in
the free sale building in the form of 12 flats along with the proportionate
car parking space in the form of 24 car parking spaces and other reliefs.
Aurora immediately applied for ad-interim reliefs which were granted by this
Court vide its order dated 3 rd December, 2012, as modified by an order dated
17th December, 2012.
3.9 In the meantime, Samir by his Advocate's letter dated 28 th November,
2012, after referring to some of the above facts alleged that there is
multiple/multi party agreements between the parties in respect of the  7/23
::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 8 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86
OF 2013 development of the said property which are intrinsically interlinked
and thereby invoked the arbitration agreement between the parties contained in
the Agreement for Sub-Development dated 22nd September, 1999, and Agreement
for Development dated 10 th March, 2003, read with the Tripartite Agreement
dated 11th September, 2009.
3.10 According to Samir, though BSRCL failed to respond to his notice, Aurora
vide its letter dated 2 nd January, 2013, concurred to the appointment of the
Learned Arbitrator as suggested by Samir. It is pertinent to note that though
Aurora has through its Counsel agreed to refer the disputes to Arbitration
subject to certain conditions, Aurora has categorically submitted that the
invocation of Arbitration by Samir does not relate to the disputes and
differences between Aurora on the one hand and BSRCL and Samir on the other
hand, but relates to inter se disputes between BSRCL and Samir.
3.11 Thereafter Samir filed the above Notice of Motion in Suit No. 62 of 2013
for referring the Suit to arbitration under Section 8 (1) of the Act. On 29th
January, 2013, Samir also filed the above Arbitration Application No. 86 of
2013 before this Court in its jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act for the
aforestated relief.
3.12 The Notice of Motion and the Application both taken out by Samir under
Sections 8 and 11 of the Act respectively are now taken up for hearing.
4\. The Learned Senior Advocate appearing for Samir has submitted that the
Agreement for Sub-Development dated 22nd September, 1999, entered into  8/23
::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 9 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86
OF 2013 between Aurora and BSRCL contained an arbitration agreement (Clause
36) for resolution of disputes and disagreements between the parties. By the
said Agreement for Sub-Development, Aurora transferred the development rights
and obligations under the Development Agreement dated 6 th October, 1996
(entered into between Aurora and the Society) in favour of BSRCL. Under the
Agreement for Development dated 10 th March, 2003, entered into between BSRCL
and Samir, Samir became entitled to 55 per cent of the area available for free
sale building and car parking and was required to construct 45 per cent of the
total area and car parking for BSRCL. The said Agreement for Development dated
10th March, 2003, also contained Arbitration Agreement (clause 31) for
resolution of disputes or differences between the parties. Aurora, BSRCL and
Samir also entered into a Tripartite Agreement on 11th September, 2009
confirming therein both the Agreements i.e. Sub-
Development Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999 and Development Agreement
dated 10th March,2003, which Agreements contained arbitration clauses 31 and
36 respectively. The said Tripartite Agreement is signed by all the three
parties to the present proceedings. It is submitted that it is therefore clear
that the subject matter of the arbitration between Aurora and BSRCL on the one
hand and Samir and BSRCL on the other hand is the same subject property and
thus there are multiple and multi party agreements having provision for
arbitration in the Agreements between Samir, Aurora and BSRCL.

KPPNair 10 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013
5\. The Learned Senior Advocate appearing for Samir has further submitted that
Section 7 (5) of the Act provides that when there is a reference in a contract
to a document containing an arbitration clause then such a contract also will
have an arbitration agreement incorporated by a reference if such contract is
in writing, and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part
of the contract. It is submitted that the Tripartite Agreement dated 11th
September, 2009, entered into between Samir, BSRCL and Aurora refers to an
Agreement for sub-development dated 22 nd September, 1999 as also Agreement
for Development dated 10 th March, 2003 and all the parties confirm the
contents of both the said Agreements and both these documents have an
arbitration clause, then by way of incorporation, the Tripartite Agreement
also becomes subject to arbitration agreement. It is submitted that the
Tripartite Agreement also refers to the development carried out by Samir on
the property and reiterates entitlement of BSRCL under the Agreement for Sub-
Development dated 22 nd September, 1999. Thus the Tripartite Agreement refers
to documents containing an arbitration clause and as such constitutes an
arbitration agreement between Samir, BSRCL and Aurora. It is submitted that
even otherwise all the three parties to the present proceedings have subjected
themselves to arbitration for resolution of their disputes arising under their
respective agreements. Both the Agreements i.e. the Sub-Development Agreement
dated 22nd September, 1999 and the Development Agreement dated 10th March,
2003, are in respect of  10/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 :::
KPPNair 11 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 development of the same property.
Both documents were connected and interdependent because the Sub-Development
Agreement arises out of the main Development Agreement. The disputes under
these two Agreements cannot be independently resolved as they are arising out
of both the Agreements and both the Agreements are connected with each other.
It is submitted that even if there are independent arbitration agreements in
both these documents, still it is necessary and in the interest of justice
that for effectual resolution of disputes both must be referred to the same
Arbitrator.
In support of its submissions, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for Samir
has relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Olympus Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. vs. Meena Vijay Khetan and others 1 and in
the case of P.R. Shah Shares and Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd. vs. B.H.H. Securities
Pvt.
Ltd. 2
6\. The Learned Senior Advocate appearing for Samir has therefore submitted on
behalf of Samir that the above Notice of Motion as well as the Application be
allowed and the disputes between the parties be referred to arbitration as
prayed.
7\. Though it is repeatedly submitted on behalf of Samir that Aurora has
expressed its willingness to refer all the disputes to arbitration, as already
set out hereinabove, the Learned Senior Advocate appearing for Aurora has
submitted that the invocation of arbitration does not relate to the disputes 1
(1999) 5 SCC 651 2 (2012) 1 SCC 594  11/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014
23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 12 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 and differences between
Aurora on the one hand and BSRCL and Samir on the other hand. However, with a
view to achieve an early resolution of disputes, Aurora has no objection to
refer all the disputes and differences to arbitration as a separate reference,
independent of the invocation by Samir, on certain conditions viz. (i) the
interim protection under order dated 3 rd December, 2013, which was modified
by an order dated 17 th December, 2013, shall continue during the pendency of
the arbitration with liberty to the parties to apply to the Arbitral Tribunal
for additional reliefs/modification of the reliefs/or vacating the reliefs;
(ii) Aurora shall be at liberty to file the statement of claim seeking reliefs
including but not limited to those claimed in the Plaint before this Court;
and (iii) BSRCL and Samir shall not raise the plea of arbitrability of
disputes before the Tribunal.
8\. The Learned Advocate appearing for BSRCL submitted that Samir has filed
the above arbitration application seeking appointment of an Arbitrator,
thereby attempting to combine parties, causes of action and arbitration
agreements into one, though in fact they are not. Samir has no claim against
Aurora. Aurora of course has made claims against BSRCL and filed a suit in
which he has joined Samir as a party. However, Samir does not have any
arbitration agreement with Aurora and is also not a party to the arbitration
agreement between Aurora and BSRCL but wants to force himself therein and
thereby compel arbitration also between Aurora and BSRCL, after Aurora has
opted out of it. It is further submitted that the claims and controversies in
12/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 13 NMS 540/2013 &
ARBP 86 OF 2013 the suit of Aurora are independent of and different and
unrelated with the claims and controversies raised by Samir against BSRCL.
Causes of action in respect of the two different sets of disputes and the
parties thereto are different and independent and an attempt is being made to
mix up and confuse the same by interlinking the same into one arbitration
between all the parties for all the matters, which however have not been
contracted for, or agreed upon by the parties. It is submitted that
unnecessary hardship will be caused to BSRCL if Samir is permitted to
intermeddle in the matters between Aurora and BSRCL and Aurora is permitted to
intermeddle in the matters between Samir and BSRCL. It is submitted that the
contention of Samir that as a result of the writing, Exhibit-E at page 133 of
the Arbitration Application No. 86 of 2013, there is a Tripartite Agreement
between Aurora, BSRCL and Samir and that as a consequence of the execution of
the said writing dated 11 th September, 2009, the provision of Clause 36
contained in the Agreement for Development dated 22nd September, 1999 between
Aurora and BSRCL also stands incorporated in the Development Agreement between
Samir and BSRCL dated 10th March, 2003, and that in any event, subsequent to
and despite the filing of the Suit, Aurora has consented to join in the
arbitration and has even concurred in the appointment of the Arbitrator made
by Samir, does not and cannot arise. It is submitted that by the said letter
dated 11 th September, 2009, all that Aurora has done is to confirm that
Aurora has no objection to Samir carrying out the development and completing
the construction, and has  13/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 :::
KPPNair 14 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 admitted awareness of the Agreement
of Development dated 10 th March, 2003.
In fact, in the said letter, Aurora has made it clear (clause-v) that Aurora
otherwise shall be entitled to all the rights under the Agreement dated 22 nd
September, 1999 in respect of the area from BSRCL.
9\. It is submitted that therefore the moot point which arises for
determination of this Court is whether a party who is not a party to the
arbitration agreement, can be compelled or permitted to join in the
arbitration proceedings, and whether it is permissible in law to club into one
arbitration proceedings and make reference to one composite arbitration
tribunal matters independently arising out of separate agreements of reference
between two different sets of parties, merely because one of the parties is
common to both the agreements of reference and pertains to the same project,
keeping in view inter alia the provisions of Section 7 of the Act. In support
of his submissions, the learned Advocate appearing for BSRCL has relied on the
decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of (i) Indowind Energy
Ltd. vs. Wescare (I) Ltd. and another3 and (ii) S.N. Prasad, Hitek Industries
(Bihar) Ltd. vs. Monnet Finance Ltd. and others4. It is also submitted by the
learned Advocate appearing for BSRCL that neither of the two judgments relied
upon by the Advocate for Samir have any applicability to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
10\. I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates 3 AIR
2010 SC 1793 4 (2011) 1 SCC 320  14/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34
::: KPPNair 15 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 appearing for the parties and
also the case law relied upon by them.
11\. By a Development Agreement dated 6th October, 1996, executed by and
between the Society on the one hand and Aurora on the other, the Society inter
alia granted development rights in respect of the said property on terms and
conditions more particularly set out therein, to Aurora. Aurora completed the
part construction of the rehabilitation building on the said property.
Thereafter under a Sub-Development Agreement dated 22 nd September, 1999,
Aurora as the Developer therein transferred/assigned its rights under the
Development Agreement dated 6th October, 1996 to BSRCL described as the Sub-
Developer therein, on terms and conditions set out therein. The only
substantial right retained by Aurora in the said Agreement was the right to
construct 15000 sq.ft. built up area as per SRA sanctioned plan for themselves
in the new building, the location of which was given in the second Schedule of
the said Agreement. It was also provided in the said Agreement that subject to
the prior written consent of Aurora, BSRCL shall be at liberty to entrust the
development rights in respect of the said property or parts thereof to other
builders and developers on terms and conditions as may be agreed between them.
BSRCL agreed that such other builders and developers shall be subject to the
same obligations and liabilities as the BSRCL. Clause 36 of the said Agreement
contains an arbitration agreement to refer the disputes and/or disagreement by
and between Aurora and BSRCL to arbitration. Since Samir is not a party to the
said Agreement dated 6 th October, 1996, consequently  15/23 ::: Downloaded on
- 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 16 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 Samir is
also not a party to the arbitration agreement contained in Clause 36 of the
said Agreement dated 22nd September, 1999.
12\. BSRCL and Samir thereafter executed an Agreement dated 10 th March, 2003,
wherein after making a reference to the Agreement dated 22 nd September, 1999,
BSRCL transferred its rights acquired by it under the Agreement dated 22nd
September, 1999 from Aurora to Samir. In the said Agreement BSRCL had agreed
to grant to Samir development rights in respect of 55 per cent of the total
area available in respect of the free sale building on the terms set out
therein and 45 per cent was retained by BSRCL. The said Agreement dated 10th
March, 2003 contains an arbitration agreement (clause
31) between BSRCL and Samir to refer any disputes or differences which may
arise between them to arbitration. Since Aurora is not a party to the said
Agreement dated 10th March, 2003 whereunder Samir acquired the rights as a
Sub-Developer to develop the said property, Aurora is also not a party to the
Arbitration Agreement contained in the said Agreement.
13\. According to Aurora, BSRCL had failed to obtain its prior permission
before transferring BSRCL's rights in favour of Samir under the Agreement
dated 10th March, 2003. Aurora came to know about the said Agreement between
BSRCL and Samir only in December, 2005. Aurora therefore addressed several
letters to BSRCL as well as to Samir raising its objection viz.
that the Agreement dated 10th March, 2003 was executed between BSRCL and
16/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 17 NMS 540/2013 &
ARBP 86 OF 2013 Samir without obtaining prior approval of Aurora. The said
objection raised by Aurora was resolved by a letter dated 11 th September,
2009, addressed by Aurora to BSRCL, the relevant clauses of which are
reproduced hereunder:
> "2. (i) As mutually agreed between us and BSRCL, we will be now entitled to
> 22,500 sq.ft. constructed area, instead of 15,000 sq.ft. constructed area as
> set out in the Agreement for Grant of Sub Development Rights dated 22nd
> September, 1999. The said 22,500 sq.ft. constructed area and proportionate
> car parking area will be provided out of 45% area coming to the share of
> BSRCL.
> 2 (ii). We shall pay to BSRCL costs of construction of total 22,500 sq.ft.
> constructed area at the rate of Rs. 500/- per sq.ft. constructed area and
> aggregating to Rs. 1,12,50,000/- (Rupees One Crore Twelve Lacs Fifty
> Thousand only) in such instalments as may be payable as per the progress
> work to be certified by Architect of you No.2 from time to time without any
> delay or default.
> 2 (v) We shall otherwise be entitled to all our rights under the Agreement
> dated 22nd September, 1999 in respect of our area from BSRCL.
14\. Though it is true that before setting out the clauses of the Agreement,
Aurora has in its letter referred to the earlier documents/agreements executed
by and between the parties, from the Agreement dated 11 th September, 2009,
more particularly the clauses set out hereinabove, it is established that
Samir was not required to provide anything to Aurora, but it was BSRCL who had
17/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 18 NMS 540/2013 &
ARBP 86 OF 2013 agreed to now hand over 22500 sq.ft. constructed area instead
of 15000 sq.ft.
constructed area to Aurora and proportionate car parking area out of the 45
per cent area coming to the share of BSRCL. The share of 55 per cent of Samir
as agreed by and between BSRCL and Samir in the Agreement dated 10 th March,
2003 therefore remained untouched. Again for the said 22500 sq.ft.
constructed area Aurora agreed to pay BSRCL Rs. 5000 per sq.ft. of constructed
area aggregating to Rs. 1,12,50,000/- with which Samir was not concerned. In
fact clause 2 (v) of the said Agreement makes it abundantly clear that Aurora
shall be entitled to all its rights under the Agreement dated 22nd September,
1999 in respect of the area to be received from BSRCL.
15\. Therefore, the only dispute raised by Aurora, is that Aurora should get
its 22500 sq.ft. of constructed area from the 45 per cent area coming to the
share of BSRCL. On the other hand, the notice of invocation issued by Samir
through his Advocates dated 28 th November, 2012 is relevant. In para 12 of
the said letter, it is recorded by the Advocates for Samir that as per the
said Agreement for Development dated 10 th March, 2003, Samir by his letter
dated 14th August, 2012 offered to hand over to BSRCL possession of the
premises in Wings A and B on the said property. However, BSRCL has not taken
possession of the same despite receipt of the said letter and that Samir has
dealt with his 55 per cent area and car parking spaces in Wings A and B of the
said building as per the said Agreement dated 10th March, 2013. This shows
that apart from there being no arbitration agreement between Aurora, BSRCL and
Samir, there  18/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 19 NMS
540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 is no dispute between Samir and Aurora qua his
22500 sq.ft. area, which he is entitled to receive from BSRCL and possession
of which has in fact been offered by Samir to BSRCL, and which possession
BSRCL has failed to take.
Again in paragraph 13 of the said letter of Invocation, the Advocates for
Samir after referring to the Agreement for Development dated 10 th March, 2003
executed by and between Samir and BSRCL have recorded that it is BSRCL who is
in breach of the Agreement dated 10 th March, 2003 and has thereafter under
clauses (i) to (xiii) set out the breaches committed by BSRCL. There is not a
single breach set out against Aurora. In fact, in the clause pertaining to
invocation (clause 14), the Advocates for Samir have clearly stated as under:
> "14. In the aforesaid circumstances, the disputes and differences have now
> arisen and which inspite of repeated requests and reminders of our client,
> you No. 1 (i.e. BSRCL) have failed to resolve and/or settle. In the
> circumstances our client is left with no other alternative but to invoke
> Agreement for Arbitration and refer the disputes and differences for
> arbitration."
16\. Despite the aforestated facts, the Advocates for Samir have, in my view,
now wrongly alleged that there are multiple and multi-party agreements having
provision for arbitration therein, between Samir, Aurora and BSRCL. In my
view, the mere reference made in the letter/agreement dated 11th September,
2009 (which does not contain an arbitration clause) to Agreements dated 22nd
September, 1999 and 10th March, 2003, which contain  19/23 ::: Downloaded on -
04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 20 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 an
arbitration agreement between Aurora and BSRCL and Samir and BSRCL
respectively, does not mean that the arbitration clauses contained therein are
part of the Tripartite Agreement dated 11 th September, 2009. In my view, the
cause of action arisen in the above Suit and the cause of action arisen under
the Agreement dated 10th March, 2003, between Samir and BSRCL cannot be said
to be the same. It therefore cannot be accepted that even if there are
independent arbitration agreements in both the documents dated 22 nd
September, 1999 and 10th March, 2003, it is still necessary and in the
interest of justice that for effectual resolution of disputes both must be
referred to the same Arbitrator.
17\. In the case of Olympus Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. vs. Meena Vijay Khetan
and others (supra) , the disputes revolved around three Agreements to Sell
three flats (main Agreements) and three related Agreements about the interior
design of the said flats (related Agreements). The parties to the Agreements
were common. All the Agreements contained an Arbitration clause. However,
clause 39 of the main Agreement was general and did not refer to any named
Arbitrator, whereas clause 5 of the related Agreements required the reference
to specifically named Arbitrators. The Hon'ble Apex Court whilst noting the
words in clause 39 of the main Agreement "Otherwise as to any other matter in
any way connected with, arising out of or in relation to the subject matter of
this Agreement", observed that clause 39 permits  20/23 ::: Downloaded on -
04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 21 NMS 540/2013 & ARBP 86 OF 2013 reference to
Arbitration not only of issues arising under the main Agreement but also those
disputes and differences which are 'connected with' disputes arising under the
main Agreement. The question which inter alia therefore arose before the
Hon'ble Apex Court was whether the disputes and differences arising under the
Interior Design Agreement are integrally 'connected with' the disputes and
differences arising from the main contract. The Hon'ble Apex Court thereafter
noted that there were several items in Schedule-E to the main Agreement which
overlap the items in Schedule-A of the Interior Design Agreement and observed
that, "therefore the coverage of the two Agreements makes it clear that the
execution of the Interior Design Agreement is 'connected with the execution of
the main Agreement".
18\. In view of the facts in the present case and the observations made
hereinabove qua the subject Agreements, it cannot be held that each of the
subject Agreements is connected to the other. In view thereof, the decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Olympus Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. vs. Meena Vijay
Khetan and others (supra) will not be applicable to the present case.
19\. As regards the decision in P.R. Shah Shares and Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd.
vs. B.H.H. Securities Pvt. Ltd. and others (supra), relied upon on behalf of
Samir, I am of the view that the same would not apply to the facts and
circumstances of the present case . In fact, paragraph 19 of the said judgment
21/23 ::: Downloaded on - 04/10/2014 23:48:34 ::: KPPNair 22 NMS 540/2013 &
ARBP 86 OF 2013 is contrary to what is submitted on behalf of Samir. The same
is reproduced hereunder:
> 19\. If A had a claim against B and C, and there was an arbitration
> agreement between A and B but there was no arbitration agreement between A
> and C, it might not be possible to have a joint arbitration against B and C.
> A cannot make a claim against C in an arbitration against B, on the ground
> that the claim was being made jointly against B and C, as C was not a party
> to the arbitration agreement. But if A had a claim against B and C and if A
> had an arbitration agreement with B and A also had a separate arbitration

The Agreements dated 22nd September, 1999, and 10th March, 2003, merely
