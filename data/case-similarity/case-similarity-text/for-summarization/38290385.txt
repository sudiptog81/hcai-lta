PER KULDIP SINGH, JUDICIAL MEMBER The Appellant, M/s. Motherson Sumi Infotech
& Designs Limited (MIND) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Taxpayer') by filing
the present appeal sought to set aside the impugned order dated 14.11.2014
passed by the Assessing Officer (AO) in consonance with the orders passed by
the ld. DRP/TPO under  2 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 section 254/143 (3) read with
section 144C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short 'the Act') qua the
assessment year 2010-11 on the grounds inter alia that :-
"That on the facts and circumstances of the case, and in law;
1\. The assessment order passed by the Learned Assessing Officer ('Ld. AO')
pursuant to the directions of Learned Dispute Resolution Panel ('Ld. DRP') is
bad in law and void ab-initio.
2\. The Ld. AO (following the directions of the Ld. DRP), erred both on facts
and in law in confirming the addition of Rs. 3,24,37,885/- to the income of
the Appellant proposed by the Transfer Pricing Officer ('Ld. TPO') by holding
that its international transactions pertaining to provision of software
development services do not satisfy the arm's length principle envisaged under
the Income- tax Act, 1961 ('the Act') and in doing so, the Ld. DRP and the Ld.
AO has grossly erred in agreeing with and upholding the Ld. TPO's action of:
> 2.1 not appreciating that none of the conditions set out in section 920(3)
> of the Act are satisfied in the present case; 2.2 ignoring the fact that the
> appellant is entitled to tax holiday under section 10B of the Act on its
> profits and therefore would not have any untoward motive of deriving a tax
> advantage by manipulating transfer prices of its international transactions;
> 2.3 disregarding the arm's length price ('ALP'), as determined by the
> Appellant in the Transfer Pricing ('TP') documentation maintained by it in
> terms of section 92D of the Act read with Rule 10D of the Income-tax Rules,
> 1962 ('Rules') as well as fresh search; and in particular modifying/
> rejecting the filters applied by the Appellant;
> 2.4 disregarding multiple year/ prior years' data as used by the Appellant
> in the TP documentation and holding that current year [i.e. Financial Year
> ('FT) 2009-10] data for comparable companies should be used;
> 2.5 rejecting comparability analysis undertaken by the Appellant in the TP
> documentation/ fresh search and conducting a fresh comparability analysis
> based on application of additional/ revised filters, or disregarding
> Appellant's filters in determining the ALP for the international
> transactions;
2.6 including companies having high margin / volatile operating profit margins
in the final comparables' set for benchmarking a  3 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 low
risk service provider such as the Appellant; 2.7 including certain companies
in the final set of comparables that are not comparable to the Appellant in
terms of functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed; 2.8 resorting
to arbitrary rejection of low-profit/ loss making companies and companies with
diminished revenues based on erroneous and inconsistent reasons;
2.9 excluding certain companies on arbitrary/ frivolous grounds even though
they are comparable to the Appellant in terms of functions performed, assets
employed and risks assumed; 2.10 by committing a number of factual
/computational errors in selection/ rejection of proposed comparables and/ or
in the operating profit margins of the comparables; 2.11 ignoring the
business/ commercial reality that the Appellant undertakes limited business
risks as against comparable companies that are full-fledged risk taking
entrepreneurs, and by not allowing a risk adjustment to the Appellant on
account of this fact;
2.12 by denying the benefit of a working capital adjustment while computing
the ALP and thereby disregarding the law, international guidance and judicial
precedents in this regard;
2.13 by making the TP addition to the entire value of transactions entered
into by the Appellant in its export segment and not only to the value of
international transactions entered into by the Appellant (i.e. proportionate
adjustments) and ignoring established jurisprudence in this regard;
2.14 disregarding judicial pronouncements in India in undertaking the TP
adjustment;
3\. On a without prejudice basis to the other grounds, the Ld. AO / DRP has
erred in facts and in law, in ignoring the alternative benchmarking analysis
conducted by the Appellant considering Internal Comparable Uncontrolled Price
('CUP') method to determine the arm's length price of the software development
services provided by the Appellant;
4\. On a without prejudice basis to the other grounds, the Appellant craves to
submit alternative benchmarking analysis considering Internal Transactional
Net Margin Method ('TNMM') to determine the arm's length price of the software
development services provided by the Appellant;
5\. The Ld. DRP erred in disregarding the detailed arguments/ submissions put
forth by the Appellant during the  4 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 course of the DRP/
assessment proceedings while passing its direction under section 144C of the
Act;
6\. The Ld. AO has grossly erred by proposing to compute interest under
section 234A, 234B, 234C and 234D of the Act;
7\. The Ld. AO has grossly erred in initiating penalty under section 27l(l)(c)
of the Act mechanically and without recording any satisfaction for its
initiation.
The above grounds are without prejudice to each other. The Appellant craves
leave to alter, amend or withdraw all or any of the grounds herein or add any
further grounds as may be considered necessary either before or during the
hearing."
2\. Briefly stated the facts necessary for adjudication of the controversy at
hand are : (M/s. Motherson Sumi Infotech & Designs Ltd. (MIND) Taxpayer is a
Joint venture between Sumitomo Wiring Systems Ltd., Japan and Motherson Group,

3\. During year under assessment, taxpayer entered into International
Transaction with its associated enterprises (AE) reported in Form No. 3 CEB as
under :-
    S. No.        International Transaction            Amount (In Rs.)

                               Total                        28,89,61,682
    4.        Taxpayer    in   its   Transfer     Pricing      (TP)    study    for
    benchmarking         its   international     transaction     qua    Software
Development Services (SDS) used transactional net margin method (TNMM) with
Operating Profit (OP) / Total Cost (TC) as Profit Level Indicator (PLI) chosen
16 comparables and computed their margin at 13.18% as against taxpayer's own
OP/TC margin of 12.99% and found its international transactions are at arm's
length.
5\. However, Ld. Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) in its TP Analysis adopted
fresh search by applying various quantitative and qualitative filters finally
selected 19 comparables and computed their average at 24.40% and thereby
proposed ALP adjustment of Rs. 3,24,37,885.
6\. Taxpayer carried the matter before Ld. DRP by way of filing objections who
has confirmed the proposed additions made by the TPO. Feeling aggrieved the
taxpayer has come up before the Tribunal by way of filing the present appeal.
7\. We have heard the ld. Authorized Representatives of the parties to the
appeal, gone through the documents relied upon and  6 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
orders passed by the revenue authorities below in the light of the facts and
circumstances of the case.
8\. Undisputedly, TNMM with OP/TC as the Profit Level Indicator (PLI) as Most
Appropriated Method (MAM) used by the taxpayer to benchmark its international
transaction qua Software Development Services has been accepted by the Ld. TPO
/ DRP. Ld. TPO / DRP proposed / confirmed the adjustment of Rs. 3,24,37,885/-
after applying TNMM with OP/TC as the most appropriated method chosen 19
comparables with average of 24.40%. Final comparables are as under :-
    Sl. No.        Name of the Company                   OP/TC

9\. Consequently Ld. TPO computed the arm's length price of the International
Transactions as under :-
    Operational Cost                        28,43,98,071

    Proposed Adjustment u/s 92CA            3,24,37,885
10\. Ld. AR for the taxpayer challenging the impugned order passed by Ld. TPO
/ DRP contended that now the only dispute left to be decided is arbitrary
selection of some comparables by TPO / DRP and has sought exclusion of 7
comparables namely E- Infochips Bangalore Ltd. ; E-Zest Solutions Ltd. ;
Infinite Data System Private Limited; Infosys Limited; Sasken Communication
Technologies Ltd.; Sonata Software Ltd. and Zylog Systems Ltd. We would
discuss the suitability of aforesaid comparables vis-à-vis taxpayer, which a
routine software development service provider working on cost plus model, one
by one.
E-infochips Bangalore Ltd.
11\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of E-infochips on grounds of functional
dissimilarity and non-availability of its segmental financial.
12\. Perusal of the annual report of E-infochips available at page 147 of the
Annual Reports Compendium (ARC) shows that E- infochips is primarily engaged
in Software Development and  8 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 I.T.enabled Services which
is considered the only reportable business segment as per Accounting Standard-
AS 17 'Segment Reporting' issued by mandatory Accounting Standards prescribed
in Companies (Accounting Standard) Rules, 2006 and the relevant provisions of
Companies Act, 1956. But segmental financials are not available. Since,
taxpayer is a routine software development service provider working on cost
plus model cannot be compared with E-infochips which is engaged in both
software development and IT enabled services.
13\. Coordinate Bench of Tribunal in case of Agilent Technologies
(International (P.) Ltd. vs. Income Tax Officer, found E-infochips not a
suitable comparable vis-à-vis routine software development service provider on
ground of non- availability of segmental financials for both the segments.
14\. So, in view of what has been discussed above, we are of the considered
view that E-infochips is not a suitable comparables vis- à-vis taxpayer,
hence, order to be excluded. E-Zest Solutions Ltd.
15\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of E-zest Solutions from the final set of
comparable for benchmarking international transaction on grounds of functional
dissimilarity as E-zest is a product Engineering and software development
company and has been  9 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 excluded by the Tribunal in
taxpayer's own case in AY 2007-08 and 2011-12.
16\. Undisputedly there is no change in the business model and FAR of the
taxpayer during the year under assessment since 2007-
08\. Perusal of annual report available at page 452 and 453 of annual
Compendium report (ARC) shows that E-zest is a product engineering and
software development company whereas taxpayer is a captive software
development service provider to its AE.
17\. Ld. DR for the revenue relied upon the order passed by the TPO and drew
our attention towards para 10.6 and contended that TPO has examined FAR of the
company and found it a suitable comparable. But, we are of the considered view
that when functional dissimilarity are apparent between E-zest Solutions vis-
à-vis taxpayer as discussed in the preceding para comprehensive exercise
carried out by the Ld. TPO is a futile exercise.
18\. Coordinate Bench of Tribunal in taxpayer's own case for AY 2011-12
excluded E-zest Solutions ltd. vide order dated 30.10.2019 passed in ITA No.
5801/Del/2011 on ground of its diversified activities without having any
segmental information on record. In view of the matter, we order to exclude
E-zest Solutions Ltd. from the final set of comparables.
10 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
Infinite Data System Private Limited (Infinite)
19\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of Infinite Data System Pvt. Ltd. on ground of
functional dissimilarity and non-availability of segmental financial. Perusal
of the Annual report of Infinite Data System Pvt. Ltd. available at page 60
and 64 of the ARC paper book goes to prove that Infinite is primarily a
service company engaged in technical consulting, design & development of
software, maintenance, systems integration, implementation, testing and
infrastructure management services, hence, it is not possible to give the
quantitative details of sales and certain information as required under
paragraphs 3, 4C and 4D of Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956".
Since its segmental reporting shows that its revenue primarily come from
technical support and infrastructure management services but no segmented data
is available.
20\. Suitability of Infinite as a comparable vis-à-vis routine Software
Development service provider has been examined by the Tribunal in case of Lime
Labs (I) (P.) Ltd. vs. Income Tax Officer and found the same not a suitable
comparables in AY 2010-11 on ground of functional dissimilarity and on ground
of super normal profit to the tune of 1496% by returning following finding :-
11 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
> "15. Furthermore, it is brought on record by the taxpayer that the
> profitability of Infinite is increased by 1496% as compared to the preceding
> year despite the fact that for computation of OP/OC, foreign exchange loss
> has been excluded from OC. So, we are of the considered view that super-
> normal profit to the tune of 1496% certainly affects OP/OC but, in this
> case, even foreign exchange loss has been excluded from the OC by the TPO
> and as such, it makes the Infinite not a valid comparable vis-à-vis the
> taxpayer. So, we are of the considered view that because of functional
> dissimilarity of Infinite vis-à-vis the taxpayer and earning super-normal
> profit by 1496% as compared to preceding years makes Infinite as invalid
> comparable. So, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude Infinite from the final set
> of comparables."
21\. So, in view of what has been discussed above, we are of the considered
view that Infinite is not a suitable comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer, hence,
order to be excluded from the final set of comparables.
Infosys Limited (Infosys)
22\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of Infosys as a comparable on the ground that
Infosys deals in both product and services and that Infosys incurred huge
research and development expenses and having huge brand value. It is brought
on record by the ld. AR that Infosys has been excluded as a comparable by the
Tribunal in Taxpayer's own case in AY 2007-08 and 2011-12. In AY 2011-12
Infosys was also excluded by Ld. DRP in assessee's own case.
23\. Ld. DR for the revenue relied on order passed by TPO and drew our
attention towards para 10.2 wherein he has discussed all the objections raised
by the taxpayer regarding brand profits,  12 ITA No.1751/Del/2015 significant
intangibles, product development sales and marketing expenses and significant
R and D expenses.
24\. We are of the considered view that Infosys as a comparable has been found
to be not a suitable comparable having huge brand value and significant
expenses on R & D vis-à-vis captive software development service provider in
number of judgement. Coordinate Bench of Tribunal in assessee's own case in
A.Y. 2007-08 and 2011-12 excluded Infosys by relying upon decision rendered by
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of Agnity India Technologies Pvt. Ltd. by the
Hon;ble High Court of Delhi in ITA No. 1204/2011 by returning following
findings :-
> "24. The Annual Report of this company is placed at pages 346 to 615 of the
> paper book. Infosys Technologies Limited has substantial intangible assets
> and is a giant company with a substantial brand value. Infosys owns
> products/IPR. The turnover of this company is approximately 700 times than
> the turnover of the appellant company and has substantial investment in
> intangibles. Being a giant company, this company has been excluded in the
> case of Agnity India Technologies Pvt Limited by the Hon'ble High Court of
> Delhi in ITA No. 1204/2011."
25\. So, keeping in view the functionality and huge brand value and
significant expenditure on R & D we find Infosys not a suitable comparable
vis-à-vis taxpayer, hence, order to be excluded. Sonata Software Ltd.
13 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
26\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of Sonata on the ground that it fails TPO's
related party (RPT) /sales filter of 25%. Since the RPT/sales of Sonnata is
59.35%, thus apparently fails TPOs filter of 25%, this comparable is remitted
back to the Ld. TPO to decide afresh after providing opportunity of being
heard to the taxpayer. Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd.
27\. Taxpayer sought exclusion of Sasken on ground of functional dissimilarity
as well as on ground of extraordinary circumstances.
28\. perusal of annual report at page 307 and 310 of the annual report
compendium shows that "Sasken Communication Technologies Limited is a provider
of telecommunication software services and solutions to network equipment
manufacturers, mobile terminal vendors and semiconductor companies around the
world. Sasken delivers end-to-end solutions that enable richer content
delivery on next generation networks". Annual report also shows that Sasken
has undertaken business restructuring during the year under assessment by
making investment in the subsidiaries and joint ventures.
29\. Since functional profile of Sasken is different vis-à-vis taxpayer and
has went into business restructuring affecting profitability. It is not a
suitable comparable.  14 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
30\. In assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 and 2011-12, Sasken was order to be
excluded as a comparable. In A.Y. 2011-12, Sasken has been ordered to be
excluded by the Coordinate Bench of Tribunal in taxpayer's own case by
returning following findings :-
> "21. On hearing the rival contentions, we are of the view that first step
> which has to be seen is functional comparability. The concerns are providing
> variety of services and application of service filter of 75% would come in
> the next rung of comparability. M/s Sasken Communication Technologies
> Limited was developing mobile enterprise applications and solutions across
> various mobile platforms including iOS, Android, Blackberry, RIM and Symbiam
> platform; which are clearly mentioned in the annual report of the said
> concern. The assessee on the other hand was only providing Software
> Development Services to its AE. Hence the concern Sasken Communication
> Technologies Limited is not functionally comparables to the assessee and
> same needs to be excluded from the final list of comparable. Accordingly, we
> hold so."
31\. So, in view of the discussion made in preceding para, we are of the
considered view that Sasken is not a suitable comparable on ground of
functional dissimilarity and business restructuring. Zylog Systems Ltd.
32\. Taxpayer sought to exclude Zylog on ground of functional dissimilarity as
well as on ground of business restructuring. Perusal of annual report at page
433 shows that Zylog has income from software development services and
products. Annual report at page 412 shows that "Zylog is making a software
solution from concept to reality is a complex and arduous process. At ZSL. We
continue to offer value to our customers and market place through value  15
ITA No.1751/Del/2015 added Research & Development, Product Engineering, and
end-to- end Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions from
conceptualization, prototyping, development, integration with Enterprise
applications, Migration, Porting, Performance Turning, Application Upgrade,
testing and maintenance".
33\. Suitability of Zylog has been examined by the Coordinate Bench of
Tribunal in case of Lime Lab (I) (P.) Ltd. vs. ITO , ITA No. 1703/Del/2015, AY
2010-11 and ordered to exclude Zylog on ground of extra ordinary event in FY
2009-10 by returning following findings :-
> "31. Perusal of the annual report available at page 457 goes to prove that
> Zylog has acquired directly M/s. Matrix Primus Partners Inc. USA, M/s.
> Algorithm Solutions Private Limited, India and acquired M/s. Brainhunters
> Inc., Canada, through our WOS Zylog Systems (Canada) Ltd., during the
> Financial years 2009-10 relevant for year under assessment in case of the
> tax payer.
> 32\. Furthermore the Zylog has invested in acquiring this business an amount
> of Rs. 62,12,04,848/- and has adopted the policy of amortizing this amount
> over a period of 5 years. Thus, the company has amortized a sum of Rs.
> 10,72,97,170/- in the year under assessment. So the acquisition being an
> extraordinary event has certainly affected the profitability of the company
> and as such cannot be a valid comparable."
34\. In view of what has been discussed above, we are of the considered view
that Zylog is not a valid comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer hence, order to be
excluded.
16 ITA No.1751/Del/2015
Grant of working capital adjustment
35\. Ld. TPO / DRP have denied the benefit of working capital adjustment while
computing the ALP on the ground that the assessee has not demonstrated that
there is a difference in levels of working capital employed by the taxpayers
vis-à-vis comparables. TP study referred to by the taxpayer for benchmarking
its International Transaction shows that the complete detail has been provided
to grant working capital adjustment. So, in view of the matter, we are of the
considered view that the matter is required to be reconsidered by the TPO by
providing opportunity of being heard to the assessee. Moreover working capital
adjustment has been granted to the taxpayer in the earlier years and since
then there is no change in the business model of the assessee. So, this issue
is remitted back to the Ld. TPO.
36\. In view of what has been discussed above, appeal filed by the taxpayer is
allowed for statistical purpose. Order pronounced in open court on 31st
August, 2020 Sd/- Sd/-
