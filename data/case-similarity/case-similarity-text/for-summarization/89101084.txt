                             REGIONAL BENCH - COURT NO.I
                      Service Tax Appeal No. 20335 of 2015
     (Arising out of Order-in-Original No. HYD-EXCUS-002-37-14-15 dated 20.11.2014
     passed by the Principal Commissioner of Service Tax, Service Tax Commissionerate,
     Basheerbagh, Hyderabad)
     M/s. Bioseed Research India,                                             : Appellant
     A Division of M/s. DCM Shriram Ltd.,
     (formerly known as 'M/s. Bioseed Research (India) Pvt. Ltd.'),
     Plot No. 206, H.No. 8-2-293/82/A/206

     Hyderabad - 500 003
                                              VERSUS
     The Commissioner of Service Tax,                                         : Respondent
     Service tax Commissionerate,
13\. From the above, we find that on merits, the issue in the case on hand is
no more res integra and accordingly, hold that the impugned order and the
demand made thereunder is not sustainable and liable to be set aside, which we
hereby do.
14.1 In the case on hand, admittedly, the appellant was not having the
privileges of Right during most part of the disputed period and therefore, the
requirements of charging Section read with the Board Circular No. 80/10/2004
(supra) remain largely unsatisfied. Hence, we  18 do not entertain the
Revenue's plea and have to hold that the demand cannot sustain beyond the
normal period.
14.2 There is also another reason as to why the demand for the extended period
cannot be sustained. The Ld. Adjudicating Authority has observed at paragraph
10 of the impugned order that the consideration was shown as 'Royalty' in the
Books of Accounts of the appellant. So, this was not something that was
suppressed or camouflaged so as to give the colour of fraud, suppression, mis-
representation, etc., for invoking the larger period of limitation.

                                                           DATE OF HEARING: 20.09.2019
                                                          DATE OF DECISION: 04.12.2019
               PER P. DINESHA :
                      Brief facts relevant for our consideration are that
               the   appellant   is   inter   alia   engaged    in    developing
               proprietary parental lines and hybrids based on its
               proprietary    germplasm       and    licences   the    same    to
               commercial seed companies who thereafter market the
                                       2
    hybrid seeds to farmers. The appellant entered into
    agreements with various commercial seed companies for
    the supply of parent seeds to the seed companies for
    production and marketing of hybrid seeds to be sold in
    the market and a sample copy of such Licence Agreement
    has been filed in the Appeal Memorandum at Annexure-3.
    A close look at the above agreement reveals inter alia
    that the appellant supplies the commercial seed company
    with parent/foundation seeds developed by it through
    research and development; that the parent/foundation
    seeds comprise of a set of 'male seeds' and a set of
    'female seeds'; that the buyer, i.e. the commercial seed
    company, passes it on to its growers, who cultivate and
    grow those parent seeds into plants and such grown
    plants could be male or female plants with the female
    plants    then    being    pollinated;      that   on    account      of
    pollination, new hybrid seeds are produced which are
    collected    by   the     growers     and     given     back   to   the
    commercial seed company, i.e. the buyer, who later on
    exploits such hybrid seeds by selling them in the open
    market; that for the parent seeds, the commercial seed
    company i.e. the buyer would pay the appellant a
    'Royalty' or 'breeding charges' for supplying the parent
    seeds, which is a pre-determined percentage of the
    revenues earned by the buyer after selling the hybrid
    seeds in the open market, etc.
    1.2      It is not disputed by any of the parties that the
    appellant     entered      into     similar     agreements          with
    independent commercial seed producers wherein the seed
    companies were also required to pay Royalty or breeding
    charges at agreed rates.
    1.3      It is the case of the appellant that none of the
    parent seeds so developed and licensed by it were
    registered under the Protection of Plant Varieties and
    Farmers' Rights Act, 2001('PPV Act' for short)or any other
    law for the time being in force at the relevant time and
    during the disputed period i.e. April 2008 to June 2012,
    the appellant had only applied for registration of certain
    parent seeds, which were pending with the appropriate
                                   3
    authority for registration. It was in       2011 i.e., on
    21.10.2011 that the appropriate authority did grant
    registration for one of the applications for registration
    dated 02.06.2009(for Corn BIO 22027), which was for
    one of the periods falling within the disputed period.
    However, it is the case of the appellant that during the
    period in dispute, there was no sale of that particular
    variety of Corn after the registration was granted.
    Subsequently, registrations were granted in respect of
    various crops on various dates. A tabulation of the same
    is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of convenience:

    1.4       The Revenue undertook investigation, during the
    course of which a letter dated 29.05.2013 was issued
    calling for balance-sheet for the years 2008-09 to 2012-
    13 along with the details of Royalty received by the
                                        4
    appellant, to which the appellant filed its reply vide letter
    dated    11.06.2013.       The     Revenue         sought   additional
    information   vide     their     letter    dated    19.07.2013    like
    invoices, agreements, etc., which were also furnished by
    the appellant vide its letter dated 29.08.2013. It is also
    the case of the appellant that with the introduction of
    Negative List with effect from 01.07.2012, the appellant
    started paying Service Tax on the Royalty amounts
    received by it on and from 01.07.2012 since, according to
    the appellant, the Royalty was not a part of the Negative
    List.
    2.1     The Revenue thereafter issued a Show Cause
    Notice dated 19.10.2013 inter alia alleging that the
    appellant was a holder of Intellectual Property Rights
    (IPR) in respect of the parent seeds supplied by them;
    that such Intellectual Property Rights were covered in the
    definition under Section 65 (55a) of the Finance Act,
    1994, being the right under the Protection of Plant
    Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001;that the appellant
    was supplying parent seeds for commercial exploitation
    whereby it was providing Intellectual Property Services by
    permitting the use or enjoyment of the Intellectual
    Property Rights for consideration in the form of Royalty,
    etc. It is a fact borne on record that the appellant did file
    its reply to the above Show Cause Notice inter alia
    contending that the appellant did not hold any Intellectual
    Property over the parent seeds supplied during the period
    in dispute; that therefore, there was no liability under
    Intellectual Property Services.
    2.2     Another Show Cause Notice was issued by the
    Revenue dated 15.05.2014 proposing to demand Service
    Tax for the period from April 2012 to June 2012 on
    almost same allegations, seeking to invoke the extended
    period of limitation under Section 73(1A) of the Finance
    Act, 1994 and also virtually reiterating the legal position
    taken in its first Show Cause Notice, to which also the
    appellant   filed    its   detailed       reply.   The   Adjudicating
                                       5
    Authority/Commissioner of Service Tax, Hyderabad, took
    up the same for adjudication and vide impugned Order
    dated 20.11.2014, confirmed the proposals contained in
    both the Show Cause Notices. The Adjudicating Authority,
    however, has inter alia observed that the appellant was
    the absolute owner and holder of the Intellectual Property
    Rights for the parent seeds by virtue of the Licence
    Agreements; that the registration was not required, but
    the recognition itself was sufficient; that the Intellectual
    Property Rights were in fact recognized by the PPV Act
    and the Rights only conferred an exclusive right and
    protection from infringement; and that the very filing of
    application for registration was itself sufficient to construe
    the appellant as the owner of such rights.
    2.3       Aggrieved, the present appeal has been filed by the
    appellant.
    3.        When the matter was taken up for hearing, Shri. S.
    Ganesh, Ld. Senior Advocate, and Shri. G. Prahlad, Ld.
    Advocate, appeared for the assessee-appellant and Shri.
    N.       BhanuKiran,    Ld.     Departmental        Representative
    appeared for the Revenue-respondent.
    4.1       The contentions of the Ld. Senior Advocate for the
    appellant are briefly summarized below :
             Section 65 (105) (zzr) of the Finance Act, 1994
              defines 'taxable service' i.e., Intellectual Property
              Service to mean service provided or to be provided
              "to any person by the holder of Intellectual
              Property Right, in relation to Intellectual Property
              Service";
             Section 65 (55a) defines 'Intellectual Property
              Right' to mean :
                    "intellectual property right means any right to
                    intangible    property,   namely,    trade   marks,
                    designs, patents or any other similar intangible
                    property, under any law for the time being in
                    force, but does not include copyright;"
                                   6
       The   Commissioner/Adjudicating           Authority   has,
        without examining the applicability in the proper
        perspective, simply held that the supply of parent
        seeds for production and marketing of hybrid seeds
        would amount to Intellectual Property Services
        covered under Section 65 (105) (zzr);
       Section 65 (105) (zzr) requires certain conditions
        to be satisfied and the mere activity of supplying
        parent seeds for commercialization is not at all
        covered;
       With regard to the condition that the service should
        be provided by the holder of Intellectual Property
        Right, he submitted that the appellant was not the
        holder of Intellectual Property Right. "Right holder"
        has only been defined under Rule 2 (d) of the
        Intellectual   Property       Rights   (Imported   Goods)
        Enforcement Rules, 2007which reads as under :
              "2. Definitions.
               .
.
.
(d) " right holder" means a natural person or a legal entity, which according
to the laws in force is to be regarded as the owner of protected intellectual
property right, its successors in title, or its duly authorized exclusive
licensee as well as an individual, a corporation or an association authorized
by any of the aforesaid persons to protect its rights."
 The requirement of the statute, therefore, is to safeguard the interests of
the owner of the protected Intellectual Property Rights and the appellant was
not at all the holder of such rights at the relevant point of time;
7
 That there was no protection to seeds and plant varieties under any specific
Indian law including the Patents Act, 1970 and therefore, the Protection of
Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 came to be adopted whereunder
Section 28 mandated registration to confer right;
 Section 24 (6) of the PPV Act specifies the requirement of issuance of
registration under Section 24 (2) of the same Act subject to payment of fees,
etc., and not from the date of application;
 Section 23 ibid is just a starting point for making an application with the
authority provided under that statute whereupon the prescribed authority gets
such application examined, as prescribed under Section 23 (3) and thereafter,
the authority may issue directions to the Registrar subject to the authority's
satisfaction;
 Section 23 (7) further obligates the registration to conditions prescribed
under Section 15;
 Registration certificate is issued on registration alone under Section 24
(2) provided an application fulfils the requirement of Section 24 (1);
 With regard to the condition that the Intellectual Property Rights should be
recognized under any law for the time being in force, the appellant's right to
the plant varieties under the PPV Act itself was not there, which is conferred
only upon registration being granted by the competent authority. Therefore,
for the period in dispute the appellant having not been granted registration,
the appellant did not enjoy any right under the PPV Act;
 During the disputed period, none of the impugned seeds were registered under
the PPV Act and the appellant only used standard formats for agreements for
protecting its trade secrets, etc.  8 4.2.1 Ld. Senior Advocate placed
reliance on the decision of this very Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
M/s. Lurgi India International Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central
Excise, Customs and Service Tax, Hyderabad reported in 2019-TIOL-1351- CESTAT-
HYDinvolving identical issue wherein the decision of the Mumbai Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of M/s. Reliance Industries Ltd. Vs. Commr. ofC.Ex. &
S.T., LTU, Mumbai reported in 2016 (44) S.T.R. 82 (Tri. - Mumbai)has been
followed.
4.2.2 He further relied on the decisions in the cases of M/s. Puma Ayurvedic
Herbal (P) Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of C.Ex., Nagpur reported in 2009 (196)
E.L.T. 3 (S.C.) andM/s.Elite Detectives Pvt. Ltd. Vs. C.S.T., Bangalore
reported in 2006 (4) S.T.R. 583 (Tri. - Bang.) to contend that the onus of
proving the alleged classification of service before fastening the appellant
with the tax liability is on the Revenue, which has not at all been
established by the Revenue and that therefore, the impugned order is liable to
be set aside.
4.3.1 Ld. Senior Advocate would further contend that at the most, the
agreement could be an agreement for transfer of trade secrets provided under
the confidentiality clause, which per se would not amount to transfer of
Intellectual Property Law as the trade secrets are not recognized as
Intellectual Property by any law for the time being in force in India.
4.3.2 In this regard, Ld. Senior Counsel referred to the C.B.D.T.
clarification vide F. No. B2/8/2004-TRU dated 10.09.2004, the relevant portion
of which reads as under:
> "09. Intellectual property services (other than copyrights):
> 9.1 Intellectual property emerges from application of intellect, which may
> be in the form of an invention, design, product, process, technology, book,
> goodwill etc.  9 In India, legislations are made in respect of certain
> Intellectual Property Rights (i.e.IPRs) such as patents, copyrights,
> trademarks and designs. The definition of taxable service includes only such
> IPRs (except copyright) that are prescribed under law for the time being in
> force. As the phrase 'law for the time being in force' implies such laws as
> are applicable in India, IPRs covered under Indian law in force at present
> alone are chargeable to service tax and IPRs like integrated circuits or
> undisclosed information (not covered by Indian law) would not be covered
> under taxable services."
to contend that trade secrets are never recognized as Intellectual Property
Law in India and that the same are just "undisclosed information"as cited by
the C.B.D.T. Circular (supra) as an example of Intellectual Property Right not
covered by any Indian law.
4.4.1 Finally, Ld. Senior Advocate contended that a part of the demand is
hopelessly barred by limitation, for which the extended period of limitation
could not be invoked. He explained that the Show Cause Notice dated 19.10.2013
was issued for the period covering 01.04.2007 to 31.03.2012; that the
appellant had filed its ST-3 return for the period ending March 2012 on
20.04.2012 and accordingly, the Show Cause Notice having been issued after
more than 18 months, is clearly barred by limitation, beyond the normal
period. Moreover, there was absolutely no suppression of any facts by the
appellant since the appellant was always under the bona fide belief that there
was no liability to Service Tax as the appellant did not hold any right; that
there were series of communications between the Revenue and the appellant
wherein the queries of the Revenue were answered by the appellant.
4.4.2 In this regard, Ld. Senior Counsel relied on the decisions in the cases
of M/s. Padmini ProductsVs. Collector of C.Ex. reported in 1989 (43) E.L.T.
195 (S.C.) and M/s.Anand Nishikawa Co. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central
Excise, Meerut, reported in  10 2005-TIOL-118-SC-CX.He also placed reliance on
the following judgements :
(i) Anantpur Textiles Ltd. Vs. C.C.E., Calcutta - 1994 (72) E.L.T. 48 (Tri.);
(ii) Hindalco Industries Ltd. Vs. C.C.E., Allahabad - 2003 (161) E.L.T. 346
(Tri. - Del);
(iii) Kirloskar Oil Engines Vs. C.C.E., Nasik - 2004 (178) E.L.T. 998 (Tri. -
Mum.);
(iv) Paro Food Products Vs. C.C.E., Hyderabad - 2005 (184) E.L.T. 50 (Tri. -
Bang.);
(v) U.T. Ltd. Vs. C.C.E., Calcutta-I - 2001 (130) E.L.T. 791 (Tri. - Kol.);
(vi) Gujrat Intelligence Security Vs. C.C.E., Vadodara -
2010-TIOL-825-CESTAT-AHM.
4.4.3 For the very same reasons, Ld. Senior Advocate submits that there cannot
be any demand towards penalty under Sections 76, 77 or 78 of the Finance Act,
1994 and nor could there be any interest under Section 75 that could be
demanded since the issues involve interpretation of statute/complex legal
provision inasmuch as the appellant only supplied parent seeds whereas the
Revenue has held that the services rendered by the appellant were in the
nature of Intellectual Property Services even though the same were not
recognized under any law for the time being in force in India. For these very
reasons, Ld. Senior Advocate submitted that even the provisions of Section 80
ibid would apply as the appellant has proved its bona fides by showing
reasonable cause, if at all there were any failures on its part, and
consequently, would be entitled for waiver of any penalties under Sections 76,
77 or 78 ibid.
11
5.1 Per contra, Ld. Departmental Representative for the Revenue while
supporting the findings of the Ld. Adjudicating Authority, put forth various
contentions, which are inter alia summarized as under :
 The assessee entered into agreements wherein it projected itself as the
holder of Intellectual Property Rights in respect of parent seeds which are
covered under Section 65 (55a) ibid., being rights under the PPV Act. The
assessee-appellant is supplying parent seeds under limited "Royalty bearing"
licence which tantamounts to the provision of IPR Servicesby permitting the
use or enjoyment of said IPR for consideration in the form of 'Royalty', which
is taxable under Section 65 (105) (zzr);
 The activities of the appellant clearly meet the conditions prescribed under
Section 65 (105) (zzr) for which our attention was invited to paragraph 9.4 at
page 14 of the impugned order;
 The appellant has not disputed the fact that it was receiving Royalty, as
shown in their Books, from its customers to whom parent seeds are supplied
under licence agreement;
 In one of the agreements, the appellant is also shown to have supplied
confidential information;
 There are various clauses in the licence agreement, a cumulative reading of
which makes it clear that the assessee are the absolute owners and holders of
IPRs for the parent seeds for which they have received Royalty;
 The requirements of law are that for the purpose of levy of Service Tax, the
IPR should be recognized under the law for the time being in force, but there
is no requirement that such IPRs are to be registered under the provisions of
law since permitting the use or enjoyment of unregistered  12 IPR is also a
taxable service. IPRs are protected by various laws from any infringement and
therefore, registration of such IPRs is only for the purpose of obtaining
protection from infringements. The levy of Service Tax cannot depend on
whether an IPR like trademark, design, patent, etc., is registered or not;
 The definition of ' taxable service' also does not require for the purposes
of levy of Service Tax all the requirements of registration under any law for
the time being in force and hence, the owner or any other person who holds the
IPRs that are recognized under any law for the time being in force, provides
any service in relation to such Intellectual Property Service for which a
consideration is received in return, shall be liable to Service Tax;
 The IPRs held by the assessee during the period of dispute, which came to be
transferred temporarily to the customers under licence agreement for a
consideration in the form of Royalty, is recognized and prescribed under the
PPV Act. Hence, whether the assessee was holding the IPRs during the disputed
period or not is not relevant;
 The appellant has filed applications for registration during 2009, 2010,
2011 and one application in 2012, apart from five such applications during
2013\. Filing of such applications itself indicates that those rights were
prescribed under the PPV Act and that the appellant, as owner, had applied for
registration, which itself is conclusive proof that the appellant owned the
IPRs even though not registered under the PPV Act, etc. 5.2 Ld. A.R. also
relied on the 'UPOV Convention' as also various decisions referred to and
relied upon by the Ld. Adjudicating Authority.

6\. We have heard the rival contentions and gone through the documents placed
on record.
7\. Two facts remain undisputed: (1) The appellant was not holding Right by
virtue of non-registration (though the same has been held to be not required
by the authority below) and (2) the appellant was reflecting the consideration
received as Royalty (paragraph 10 of the impugned order) in its Books of
Account. Therefore, the only issue to be decided in the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, as pleaded by both the sides, is : "Whether there
is any liability to Service Tax under Intellectual Property Service on the
consideration received as Royalty?"
8.1 The relevant Sections of the Finance Act have already been extracted in
the earlier paragraphs. Section 65 (55a) prescribes, while defining IPR, "any
right .... under any law for the time being in force" and this has also been
clarified by the C.B.E.C. vide Circular No. 80/10/2004-S.T. dated 17.09.2004
(with effect from 10.09.2004). The clarification reads thus :"The definition
of taxable service includes only such IPRs (except copyright) that are
prescribed under law for the time being in force. As the phrase 'law for the
time being in force' implies such laws as are applicable in India, IPRs
covered under Indian law in force at present alone are chargeable to service
tax..."
8.2 Section 23 of the PPV Act prescribes the procedure for registration under
the Act and the issuance of certificate of registration is prescribed under
Section 24 ibid. Further, Section 28 mandates the conferring of Right. Section
23 prescribes the detailed procedure requiring the Registrar to first satisfy
itself with the requirements and thereafter get the application examined and
only thereafter he shall forward such application with relevant documents to
the authority under the Act. Finally, it is the authority which issues
directions to the Registrar or rejects such application under the Act. Once
the application for registration of a variety is approved  14 i.e., accepted,
only then the same is registered and the certificate of registration is issued
in terms of Section 24 and only when such certificate of registration is
issued under the Act, it shall confer an exclusive right in terms of Section
28 ibid.
9\. In view of the above, therefore, what is clear is that mere filing of
application would not lead an applicant anywhere and such applicant would not
automatically become owner/holder of Right under the Act unless such right is
conferred in terms of Section 28 after due process as prescribed under the
said Act. Hence, one of the objections of the Revenue that mere filing is
sufficient cannot survive.
10.1 The Revenue has mainly referred to the agreements between the appellant
and its customers and various clauses therein and inter alia observed that the
appellants are the absolute owners and holders of IPR, by which the appellants
are fastened with tax liability. To our understanding, any agreement between
two parties inter se is civil in nature, which only binds the parties thereto
to the terms or contents therein. Such agreements could also be financial in
nature whereby consideration is being passed on, however, subject to certain
acts/omissions/conditions or terms in such agreements. So, any failure on the
part of one of the parties to such an agreement would only lead to a civil
dispute, maybe for specific performance or enforcement or recovery, etc. Such
agreements, therefore, are binding only on the parties who bind themselves
with the terms and conditions therein and no outsider would ever have or be
influenced by any of the terms therein. So also, such agreements or clauses
thereunder cannot have the effect of fastening any tax liability, that too
under a taxing statute independent of Article 265 of the Constitution of
India.
10.2 So, to read it in a manner so as to fix tax liability would, in our view,
be a little too far-fetched. Therefore, to use the agreement and the clauses
therein just to  15 fasten tax liability may not stand, more so in the absence
of sanction under the taxing statute; charge to tax could only be from the
taxing statute and not from the inter se agreements.
11\. Now, coming to the requirements of law, the governing statute is the PPV
Act, according to which the Right flows from the moment the registration is
granted. Once the application is filed, procedure follows, which is not just
an empty formality. The governing statute thus confers and recognizes an
applicant's right, which thus satisfies the conditions in Section 65 (55a)
read with Circular No. 80/10/2004 (supra), i.e., the applicant becomes
holder/owner of Intellectual Property Right prescribed under the relevant Act
i.e., the PPV Act, which for the time being is in force.
12.1 In this connection, we note the findings of the Mumbai Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of M/s. Reliance Industries Ltd. (supra) wherein after
recording the relevant observations of the Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal
in the case of M/s. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of S.T.,
Mumbai reported in 2016 (41) S.T.R. 121 (Tri. - Mumbai), the following
observations have been made :
> "9.1 We also note that a Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal has in the case
> of TCS v. CST - 2016 (41) S.T.R. 121 (T) taken a view similar to the one
> taken by us above. The relevant observations of the Tribunal read as under :
> "4. The taxable service under consideration is defined under Section
> 65(105)(zzr) to mean any service provided or to be provided to any person,
> by the holder of Intellectual Property Right, in relation to Intellectual
> Property Service. Intellectual Property Service is defined under Section
> 65(55b) to mean (a) transferring (temporarily); or (b) permitting the use or
> enjoyment of, any intellectual property right. And Intellectual Property
> Right as defined under Section 65(55a) means any right to intangible
> property, namely, trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar
> intangible property, under any law for the time being in force, but does not
> include copyright.
16
> 4.1 Short question to be decided is whether the transfer of technical 'know
> how' received by the Appellant is a service which may be categorized under
> "Intellectual Property Right Services". We find that the definition of
> Intellectual Property Right must be satisfied to term the services received
> by the Appellant as Intellectual Property Right Services. We find no clue at
> all in the records as to which type of Intellectual Property Right is being
> assigned to the "Technical know- how" received by the Appellant. It is
> obvious from the definition of Intellectual Property Right that the right
> has to be a specific Right under a specific Law. Examples are given under
> the definition such as the Trade Mark which is a right provided under "Trade
> Marks Act". Similarly the right mentioned as 'design' in the definition is a
> right under the "Designs Act". Therefore we find that the technical know-how
> received by the Appellant and the royalty payment made by the Appellant to
> Unisys is nowhere established to result from the use of any Intellectual
> Property Right.
> 4.2 We may further go on to add that the Intellectual Property Right should
> be a right under the Indian law. Intellectual Property Right not covered by
> the Indian laws would not be covered under taxable service in the category
> of Intellectual Property Right Services. We are fortified in our view by
> Board Circular F. No. 80/10/2004-S.T., dated 17-9-2004 which clarified that
> "Intellectual Property emerges from application of intellect, which may be
> in the form of an invention, design, product, process, technology, book,
> goodwill, etc. In India, legislations are made in respect of certain
> Intellectual Property Rights (i.e. IPRs) such as patents, copyrights,
> trademarks and designs. The definition of taxable service includes only such
> IPRs (except copyright) that are prescribed under law for the time being in
> force. As the phrase "law for the time being in force" implies such laws as
> are applicable in India, IPRs covered under Indian law in force at present
> alone are chargeable to service tax and IPRs like integrated circuits or
> undisclosed information (not covered by Indian law) would not be covered
> under taxable services."
11\. Insofar as the agreement with Investa Technologies S.A.R.L. is concerned
the same was entered into on 14-8-2004, prior to IPR services being brought
into the net of service tax w.e.f. 10-9-2004. The service itself having been
rendered prior to the introduction of the levy, the mere fact that payments
for  17 the same were made on a staggered basis over a period of time cannot
be a ground for levying service tax merely with reference to the date on which
payments were being made. We find that during the relevant period the issue as
to whether a transaction is leviable to service tax and if so at what rate was
required to be reckoned with reference to the date when the service was
rendered and not with reference to the date on which payment is made. The law
in this regard is settled by the decision of the CESTAT reported in 2008 (10)
S.T.R. 243 which was affirmed by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the
Appellant's own case reported in 2010 (19) S.T.R. 807 as also by the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of CCE v. Consulting Engineering Services India
(P) Ltd.2013 (30) S.T.R. 586. As the service in the case of Investa
Technologies S.A.R.L, was rendered prior to 10-9-2004, the date when the
taxing entry was brought to the Statute the mere subsequent payment in respect
of services that are already being rendered cannot be brought to tax with
respect to the rate applicable on the date on which the payment was effected."
The very same view has been followed by this very Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of M/s. Lurgi India International Services Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
12.2 The cumulative takeaway from the above orders is that in order to fasten
the Service Tax liability, the person providing the service (technical
knowhow) has to be registered with the Patents Authority in India and that if
the IPR is registered in any foreign country, but is not registered in India,
the same will not attract the Service Tax.
13\. From the above, we find that on merits, the issue in the case on hand is
no more res integra and accordingly, hold that the impugned order and the
demand made thereunder is not sustainable and liable to be set aside, which we
hereby do.
14.1 In the case on hand, admittedly, the appellant was not having the
privileges of Right during most part of the disputed period and therefore, the
requirements of charging Section read with the Board Circular No. 80/10/2004
(supra) remain largely unsatisfied. Hence, we  18 do not entertain the
Revenue's plea and have to hold that the demand cannot sustain beyond the
normal period.
14.2 There is also another reason as to why the demand for the extended period
cannot be sustained. The Ld. Adjudicating Authority has observed at paragraph
10 of the impugned order that the consideration was shown as 'Royalty' in the
Books of Accounts of the appellant. So, this was not something that was
suppressed or camouflaged so as to give the colour of fraud, suppression, mis-
representation, etc., for invoking the larger period of limitation.
15\. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed both on merits as well
as limitation with consequential benefits, if any, as per law.
