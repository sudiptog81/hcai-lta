    +                   CS(OS) 851/2012
     SANJAY KAPUR & ANR.                                     ..... Plaintiffs
                     Through               Ms. Prathiba M.Singh and

          HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH
    JAYANT NATH, J.
IA No.5961/2012 (Order 39 R.1 & 2 CPC) & IA No.7602/2012 (Order 39 Rule 4) in
CS(OS) 851/2012
1\. The present application of the plaintiffs for interim stay being
> mark or business name, the order may be an absolute injunction that he would
> not use or carry on business under that name, (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97)."
34\. In my view the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of long
continuous user of the trade dress/packaging which is the subject matter of
the present Suit. The nature and extent of the user by the defendant of the
Packaging/Trade Dress which is subject matter of this suit is not clear.
Balance of convenience would hence be in favour of the plaintiff and against
the defendant. The plaintiffs are likely to suffer an irreparable loss and
injury in case, ex parte injunction granted by this Court is not continued.
35\. In view of the above, the present application IA No.5961/2012 is allowed
and the defendant is restrained from selling or dealing with tea products in
packaging using the brand name „BAGAN Fresh‟ which is identical or deceptively
similar to the plaintiff‟s packaging as depicted by the plaintiff in the
documents filed alongwith the plaint and as elaborated in paragraph 5 above
till pendency of the accompanying suit.
36\. IA No.7602/2012 under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC filed by the defendant is
1\. The present application of the plaintiffs for interim stay being
I.A.No.5961/2012 came up for hearing for the first time before the court on
30.03.2012 when this court passed an ex parte ad interim injunction
restraining the defendant to export or sell their tea products i.e. „BAGAN
Fresh Tea‟ in the packaging which is either identical or deceptively similar
to the plaintiffs‟ packaging or to open other retail outlets in Delhi to sell
their product under the deceptively similar packaging till further orders. The
defendant has thereafter moved an application being IA No.7602/2012 under
Order 39 Rule 4 CPC seeking vacation of the said stay. Notice was issued on
the said application on 25.04.2012. The present order disposes off the said
two applications.
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 1 of 18
2\. The accompanying plaint is filed by the plaintiffs seeking a decree to
restrain the defendant, etc. from selling, advertising, etc tea powder/tea
products sold as „BAGAN Fresh Tea‟ or any other hot beverage products in
packaging which is either identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs
packaging or which is a colourable imitation or substantial reproduction of
the plaintiffs‟ packaging. Other connected reliefs including decree for
rendition of accounts are also sought.
3\. The plaintiffs state in the plaint that they set up their sole
proprietorship concern „Aap Ki Pasand‟ in 1981 and since then they made it the
most reputed name in the luxury segment of the tea market. The plaintiffs
further submit that in 1981, he innovated a new way and manner of packaging
their tea. The innovative features and element of the said packaging included
packing tea in a soft paper packet shaped in a rectangular sided cuboid. This
packet is slipped into a fabric sleeve and is closed at top by a traditional
drawstring/dori. The said pack is then decorated with ribbon and the label
tied around the fabric bag. Lastly the finished and ornamented pack is slipped
inside a glossy see-through poly sleeve. The plaintiffs claim to have carved a
distinct niche for themselves in the tea market owing to the said unique
packaging and excellent quality of products sold by them.
4\. In 1981, it is stated that they opened their first tea boutique in Delhi.
It is further stated that the plaintiffs‟ products have been exported to
various countries, their products are sold in all duty free shops in India at
International Airports and are also procured by the Cottage Industries,
Emporia in Delhi and Indian Tourism Development Corporation for their various
outlets and supplied to Air India for its in-flight sale. Some of the earlier
orders were from Maurya Sheraton in 1984 and Hyatt Regency, Delhi
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 2 of 18 in 1983 & 1984\. Various other such examples
are stated. The details of the plaintiffs‟ turnover are given in para 12 of
the plaint. As per the said para, the sales figure for the year 2010-11 is
`5,49,68,752/- whereas the exports are nearly `76 lacs.
5\. It is stressed that the trade dress of the plaintiffs consists of
distinctive elements which are completely unique and unknown prior to the
plaintiffs having commissioned their first packaging. The details of the
uniqueness of the packaging are elaborated in para 13 of the plaint and the
relevant description reads as follows:-
>  'The soft paper pouch of cuboidal/rectangular shape, designed to make a
> unique look stand-up soft pack;  The cuboidal shape is adorned with a
> textile packing bag over the primary cuboidal paper pouch;
>  The packing bag is ornamented with a drawstring on top and flat
> rectangular bottom which facilities a stand-up pouch;
>  Only Indian look fabrics are used for the packaging;  The ornamentation
> with a centralised label and a ribbon to finish it constitutes a typical
> trade dress;  The cuboidal shape is volume efficient as it makes a big
> faced pack. It is a tall look pack, albeit, flat in depth, that makes a
> large face of the pack. This facilities many marketing messages over a large
> face of pack;
>  The cuboidal and flat bottom pack with a fabric bag is light in weight and
> hence economical to transport even by air. SAN-CHA brand even today is
> exported by air as it is an economical and efficient (airworthy of freight)
> in freight cost;
>  Last but not the least, the packing bag (in various textiles) has an
> Indian look and Indian feel;"
6\. Hence, it is urged that packaging is unique and distinctive and is
protectable under the statute and under common law including under law of
passing off. It is further urged that the packaging is innovative/creative and
is a original artistic work under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 3 of 18 is capable of protection.
7\. It is further urged that in 2011, it was revealed to the plaintiffs that
the defendant‟s product has identical packaging, ornamentation, colour range,
material etc. used for loose tea. The look of the defendant‟s product from a
distance would give an unmistakable impression of the plaintiffs‟ product.
Hence, it is urged that the defendant has copied and imitated the packaging of
the plaintiffs. The imitation is completely dishonest and a mala fide attempt
to take advantage of the hard-earned market built by the plaintiffs. The
defendant has started selling the infringing packet only few months back. The
plaintiffs are stated to have protested in mid 2011. Hence, the present suit
has been filed.
8\. The defendant has contested the claim of the plaintiffs and has filed its
written statement. The defendant states that they have been marketing teas in
fancy Indian patterned fabric gift packs since 2008 and have built up a
significant reputation and market.
9\. It is firstly urged that the packing that the plaintiffs seek to restrain
is generic and has no distinctive value qua its products. It is urged that in
order to increase export of tea from India various players in the said
industry have come with different unique ideas. To give an Indian touch
various traders and packers have started packaging in small pouches and have
added a design to lure foreign buyers to buy tea in said pouch as gift
articles/souvenirs. Hence the get-up of the plaintiff, signifying an Indian
origin with traditional fabric pouches, it is stated is absolutely generic to
the trade. It is further urged that there are several other players in the
market segment who are using decorative packaging. Some of the players have
been in the market for over 50 years. Reference is made to some of them like
Golden Tips, Mittal Group of Companies and New Directions Exports and
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 4 of 18 Crafts.
10\. It is further stated that the decoration qua the pouch on the basis of
which plaintiffs are claiming distinctiveness is actually something that is
freely available in the market and various expensive merchandize products and
gifts are often sold in this kind of pouch to give the product a feeling of
Indianness and distinctiveness. In fact, it is urged that these pouches are
freely exchanged between people on important occasions such as weddings and
festivals like Diwali, etc. and these pouches have existed for many years
before the plaintiffs commenced trading.
11\. It is secondly urged that the packaging which plaintiffs seek to protect
is actually a packaging which serves a useful purpose, namely, preserving tea
and its delicate flavour. If the tea is sold in bulk, it can be sold in wooden
chests or paper sacks, etc. In retail when it is sold in small quantity, it
must be sold in small packages which keep it dry, air tight and safe from
being crushed. It is further urged that most of the tea producers who package
and sell tea to retail consumers focusing on the gift and export market have
the following requirements:- (a) packaging must be airtight, (b) packaging
must be traditional or ethnic and indicate an Indian origin or connection, (c)
packaging must be light and retail sized and (d) appearance of gift wrapping
must be there.
12\. It is next urged that the drinkers of tea are very particular about the
brand of tea they consume, for example Earl Grey, Oolong, etc. Hence, when
they go to a store or emporium, consumers search for brand or search for a
variety of leaf. No consumer of tea will associate a brand of tea with a vague
or a generic method of packaging. It is further urged that regular tea
available in Indian market costs about `500/- per Kg. However, gift packed
aromatic organic teas cost upto `20,000/- per Kg. The tea packaged and
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 5 of 18 sold by the plaintiffs and defendant costs
roughly around ` 4,000/- per Kg and is therefore consumed by rich and educated
strata of society who cannot possibly be deceived by mere resemblance of tea
based on a generic mode of packaging.
13\. It is fourthly urged that there are various distinguishing factors in the
style and get up of the two brands and the consumers are hence able to
distinguish between the same. It is urged that the pouches of the defendant
bear the label „BAGAN Fresh' in a very conspicuous manner dispelling any
apprehension whatsoever of any customer or consumer being deceived. The logo
of the plaintiffs is different from the logo of the defendant. The brand of
the plaintiff „Aap Ki Pasand‟ is printed in gold with a wreath whereas the
brand of the defendant „BAGAN Fresh‟ is printed within a green box also
depicting a yellow green leaf. There is stated to be a marked difference in
colour scheme of both the brands. Various other features are listed to try and
argue that there are many dis-similarities between the packaging and get up of
the plaintiffs and defendant.
14\. It is next urged that the defendant has been in the market since 2008 and
the plaintiff has failed to raise any objection. Hence, it is urged that the
present suit is a belated attempt to suppress competition inasmuch as the
defendant has acquired considerable goodwill and made a name for itself in the
market with its latest advent into Delhi Airports and the defendant poses a
serious threat to the business of the plaintiffs.
15\. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has strenuously urged that the
plaintiffs have designed a unique and innovative way of packaging their tea
using ethnic Indian fabric material. She relies on various documents filed
alongwith the plaint to submit that the plaintiff enjoys a great reputation
and goodwill including the unique packaging. Reliance is placed on Section 2
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 6 of 18 (zb) of the Trade Marks Act whereunder
trademark is now expressly defined to mean a mark capable of being represented
graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of
one person from those of others and includes the shape of goods, their
packaging and combination of colours. Reliance is placed on the photographs of
the packaging of the plaintiff which are filed alongwith the plaint and also
the photographs of the packaging being used by the defendant to submit that
the defendant is malafidely copying the trade dress of the plaintiff with an
attempt to pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. Reliance is placed on
the annual turn-over of the plaintiff which is placed on record where it is
claimed that for the Financial Year 2010-11 the plaintiff no.1 had a turn-over
of `5.49 crores and plaintiff no.2 had a turnover of `75.9lacs. Reliance is
also placed on various advertisements issued pertaining to the product of the
plaintiff starting from an advertisement issued in the Economic Times on
11.01.1992. Reliance is placed on copies of Advertisements issued for the
plaintiff‟s product on 09.11.1993, 16.11.1993, 20.07.1996, 25.08.1996, and so
on which have been placed on record. It is urged that the documents of the
plaintiffs show that the plaintiff had been extensively advertising for now
nearly 30 years. Reliance is also placed upon certain orders received on
19.11.1985 and 08.05.1986 from the Ministry of External Affairs in connection
with the visit of the Prime Minister of India abroad to Japan and African
countries respectively. Another such communication is dated 14.6.2010 in
connection with the visit of the Prime Minister to Canada for G-20 Summit.
Reliance is also placed upon an Order dated 8.11.1984 received from Hotel
Hyatt Regency, Delhi and dated 24.9.1985 from Hotel Maurya Sheraton. It is
further urged that the trade mark of the plaintiff i.e. San-cha (Label) is
duly registered as per Registration Certificate dated 08.08.1989. Based on the
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 7 of 18 above submissions it is urged that the unique
packaging of the plaintiff with its various distinguishing features elaborated
as above is closely identified with the product of the plaintiff. It is urged
that the packaging now introduced by the defendant is a dishonest attempt to
pass off its product as that of the plaintiff and hence it is urged that the
ex parte interim order passed by this Court on 30.3.2012 should be continued
till pendency of the present Suit.
16\. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs relies upon the judgment in the case
of Heinz Italia & Anr. vs. Dabur India Ltd., (2007) 6 SCC 1 where the Hon‟ble
Supreme Court held that colour scheme and overall effect of the packaging has
to be seen. The said judgment relied upon the case of Cadila Healthcare
Limited vs Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited, (2001) 5 SCC 753 where it was held
that in a passing of action similarities rather than dis- similarities have to
be taken note of by the court. Reliance is also placed on the case of Parle
Products Pvt. Ltd. vs. J.P. and Co. Mysore, (1972) 1 SCC 618 where the court
was of the view that in a passing off action minor details are not to be
looked into but the broad features. Reliance is also placed on the case of
Gorbatschow Wodka KG. Vs. John Distilleries Ltd., 2011 (4) MhLj 842 where the
Bombay High Court held that the expression trade mark is now expressly defined
and includes the shape of the goods. In that case the court based on the
material placed on record by the plaintiff prima facie held that integral part
of the plaintiff‟s product lies in the shape of the bottle in which the Vodka
is sold though the shape of the bottle has no functional relationship with the
nature or quality of the product. Reliance is also placed on the case of
Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. vs. Borden Inc. & Ors., 1990 (RPC) 341 where it
was held that passing off action is possible on the get up of the plaintiff‟s
goods. Reliance is also placed on the CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 8 of 18 judgments
in the cases of Baker Hughes Ltd. & Anr. vs. Hiroo Khushalani & Anr., 74
(1998) DLT 715; Baker Hughes Ltd. & Anr. vs. Hiroo Khushalani & Anr., (2004)
12 SCC 628; Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah & Anr., (2002) 3 SCC 65;
Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India Ltd., 2008 (38) PTC 49 (Del) (DB); M/s Satyam
Infoway Ltd. vs. M/s Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd., AIR 2004 SC 3540) and Info
Edge (India) Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. vs. Shailesh Gupta and Anr.,
2002(24)PTC355(Del) to contend that get up of the good can be a basis for a
passing off action in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
17\. Learned counsel appearing for the defendant on the other hand has urged
that there are enough reasons to vacate the interim orders passed by this
Court. It is strenuously urged that firstly the trade dress which is being
used by the plaintiff is quite common to the trade inasmuch as packaging using
traditional Indian fabric is a common occurrence. It is urged that there are
already eight to ten manufacturers/dealers in the market using a trade dress
akin to that of the plaintiff. It is secondly urged that the trade dress of
the plaintiff has no innovation nor is it unique in any manner. Hence, it is
urged that the said trade dress is entitled to no protection. It is thirdly
urged that even if the trade dress was similar where the trademarks are
different there would be no question of passing off and no injunction should
be granted. It is fourthly urged that the present application of the plaintiff
and reliefs sought are liable to be rejected on account of delay and laches.
It is urged that the defendant has been in the market since 2008 and has
carved out a market and place for itself. Hence, it is urged that the present
suit filed in 2012 and on account of this delay the plaintiff is not entitled
to any interim relief. It is further urged that the present litigation is only
an attempt to stifle competition as the defendant has made a name for itself.
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 9 of 18
18\. Learned counsel for the defendant relies upon the judgement of the
Division Bench of this High Court in the case of Kellogg Company vs. Pravin
Kumar Bhadabhai & Anr. 62 (1996) DLT 79 to contend that where even prima facie
get ups are similar, the fact that the brand‟s name is prominently displayed
on the different packets would make it a fit case for not grant of interim
injunction. Reliance is also placed on Samsonite Corporation & Anr. vs. Vijay
Sales 73(1998) DLT 732 where this court held that the plaintiff has to
establish that its trade dress or get up has become by use distinctive of the
plaintiff‟s goods. The word „distinctive‟ would be taken as meaning factually
distinctive and not mere assertion. The plaintiff has to establish that the
trade dress or get up of the plaintiff has become associated exclusively with
the products of the plaintiff. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of
England and Wales High Court (Chancery Division) in the case of M.Saper LD.
vs. Specter's LD. And Boxes Ltd., 13 (R.P.C.) 218 where it was held that
competition must remain free inasmuch as the defendant does no wrong by
entering in the market created by another and competing with its creator.
19\. It is true that under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 the shape of a good has
been included in the definition of trade mark. The relevant portion of Section
2(zb) reads as follows:-
> "(zb) "Trade Mark" means a mark capable of being represented graphically and
> which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from
> those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and
> combination of colour"
20\. The Bombay High Court in the case of Gorbatschow Wodka KG. Vs. John
Distilleries Ltd. (supra) while dealing with the shape of a bottle of Vodka on
facts based on material placed on record by the plaintiff noted that prima
facie the plaintiff has established a reputation and integral part of the
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 10 of 18 reputation lies in the shape of the bottle in
which the Vodka is sold. In paras 17 the court held as follows:-
> "17. Prima facie, a comparison of the shape of the bottle which has been
> adopted by the defendant with the bottle of the plaintiff would show us
> striking similarity. As a matter of fact, counsel appearing on behalf of the
> defendant did, during the course of the submission, concede that there are
> similarities. Counsel, however, sought to urge that there are differences
> between the shape of the bottle which has been adopted by the plaintiff and
> shape of the bottle that has been adopted by the defendant and these
> differences would emerge if the bottles were to be compared, as it were,
> side by side.
21\. The court in the above case further held that the defendant is engaged in
the same trade and it was impossible to accept that the defendant would not
have been conscious of the shape which was used by the plaintiff for its
bottle of Vodka. The adoption of the shape by the defendant was held to be
prima facie not honest. The court in the facts granted an appropriate interim
injunction in favour of the plaintiff.
22\. Similarly the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Heinz Italia & Anr.
vs. Dabur India Ltd.(supra) which pertains to an action against the defendant
from using the mark and the deceptive packaging in paragraph 18 held as
follows:
> "18. ... We are of the opinion however that the colour scheme and the
> overall effect of the packaging has to be seen. We have also examined Item D
> individually which is the exclusive packaging for Glucose-D; the one on the
> extreme left being the packaging in the year 1989, the one in the middle
> being the one for the year 2000 (which is impugned in the present suit) and
> the third on the extreme right which is the subject-matter of the suit in
> Calcutta which has been stayed on the application made by the respondent. We
> are of the opinion that the packaging of Glucose-D and Glucon-D is so
> similar that it can easily confuse a purchaser. We also feel that mere fact
> that the respondents have time and again made small changes in their
> packaging is CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 11 of 18 an attempt to continue to
> mislead the purchaser and to make it more difficult for the appellants to
> protect their mark, which the record shows has acquired an enviable
> reputation in the market which is sought to be exploited by the respondent."
23\. The real issue is as to whether the plaintiff by long user can claim
exclusive rights to the trade dress/packaging being used by it.
24\. Lets come to the facts of this case. As per the plaint and the
accompanying documents, the plaintiffs have started using the innovative
manner of packaging of their tea since 1981. The unique part of the packing
features are reproduced in para 5 above. Photographs of the packaging/pouch
are filed. They were also produced physically in Court. The sales figures of
plaintiff No.1 are placed on record, which reads as follows:-
          Fin.Years      Turnover
                         (Rupees)
          1991-2000      6,71,81,832
          2001-2005      6,04,72,436
          2005-2006      1,26,61,909
          2006-2007      1,62,99,982
          2007-2008      2,98,04,747
          2008-2009      3,90,75,788
          2009-2010      5,14,20,287
          2010-2011      5,49,68,752
The sales figure of plaintiff No.2 are stated as follows:-
          Fin. Years      Turnover
                          (Rupees)
          1996-2000       1,20,65,464
          2001-2005       2,41,75,856
          2005-2006        37,36,226
          2006-2007        44,08,309
          2007-2008        43,95,151
          2008-2009        57,06,480
          2009-2010        54,91,899
    CS(OS)No.851/2012                                                  Page 12 of 18
            2010-2011       75,98,483
25\. These figures are duly supported by a certificate of Mr. V.K. Thapar
Chartered Accountant. The plaintiff has also placed on record advertisements,
newspaper features and communications to show that the product is being
advertised right since the beginning. The advertisements relate to and are
from the year 1992 onwards. Advertisements issued in the Economic Times, The
Pioneer, Times of India, Swagat In-flight magazine of Indian Airlines, etc.
have been placed on record. Reliance is also placed on orders received from
Ministry of External Affairs in connection with the visit of the Prime
Minister abroad. A communication dated 19.11.1985 from the Ministry of
External Affairs placing an order for tea caddies and in connection with the
Prime Minister‟s visit to Japan is on record. Similar is an order dated
08.05.1986 in connection with the Prime Minister‟s visit to African countries.
Similar correspondences pertaining to similar other foreign delegations are
also placed on record. The plaintiff has also placed on record an order dated
08.11.1984 received from hotel Hyatt Regency Delhi and an order dated
24.09.1985 from Hotel Maurya Sheraton, New Delhi. On the basis of long usage
for the last more than 30 years and on the basis of this reputation and
turnover and its niche mark, the plaintiff has strenuously urged that the
packaging of the plaintiff is unique, innovative and in the market the
packaging is commonly associated as of belonging to the plaintiffs and their
products.
26\. What is the effect of the above evidence placed on record by the
plaintiff. The advertisements clearly show the product of the plaintiff
including the packaging that is being used and on account of which the
plaintiff has filed the present Suit for action of passing off. The
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 13 of 18 advertisements start from 1992. The turn-over
of the plaintiff is placed on record supported by a certificate of the
Chartered Accountant. The turn- over is stated to be attained in the form of
sales through the said packaging which is subject matter of the present Suit.
The usage of the brand in the packaging is long and reasonably extensive. The
plaintiff has prima facie proved that the packaging which is subject matter of
the present Suit which is described in para 5 above is in long use by the
plaintiff. The long user by the plaintiff is not really denied. The evidence
also prima facie for the purpose of disposal of this application shows that
the trade dress/packaging of the plaintiff is part of the essential features
on the basis of which the product of the plaintiff is identified. The trade
dress/packaging is prima facie distinctive and forms an intrinsic part of the
goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff in the market.
27\. What has been strenuously urged by the learned counsel for the defendant
is that the trade dress being used by the plaintiff is common in the trade and
that it is essentially a traditional Indian fabric which is used by various
manufactures and producers in the market including the defendant and there is
no innovation involved in the same. It is further urged that there are 8 to 10
other manufactures and dealers in the market which use trade dress akin to
that of the plaintiff.
A perusal of the photographs placed on record by the plaintiffs and the
packets that were produced during the course of arguments would show that the
packaging being used by the plaintiffs has some unique features. It is no
doubt that it is using Indian fabric but that per se is not the only feature
of the packaging. The cuboidal/rectangular shape with the unique stand-up pack
with Indian look fabric with the traditional dori on top with a glossy packing
is being used.
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 14 of 18
The defendant has placed on record some photographs of packaging used by other
manufactures. Even in the written statement the defendant has depicted
pictures of packaging being used by other manufacturers. A close look of these
pictures would show that all kinds of packaging are being used by the said so
called other manufacturers some of which are using the traditional Indian
fabric. Only some of the packaging appears to be some what identical to that
of the plaintiff. However there are no details placed on record of the date
since when these packaging are used by the said manufactures and the extent of
market that they have. The said instances placed on record by the defendant
appear to be stray incidents and do not in any way dilute the case of the
plaintiff. Even otherwise, the use of similar marks or trade dress by a third
party cannot be a defence to an illegal act of passing off. Reference may be
had to the judgment of this Court in the case of Pankaj Goel vs. Dabur India
Ltd., (supra).
28\. Learned counsel for the defendant has also relied heavily on the judgment
of the Division Bench of this High Court in the case of Kellogg Company vs.
Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai & Anr. (supra) to contend that where the trade mark is
being used on the packaging there can be no question of passing off based on
packaging.
29\. A perusal of the said judgment would show that it was based on the facts
of the case. The plaintiff in that case had filed the Suit with a grievance
that the carton in which the defendant was selling corn flakes was more or
less similar in size to that of the plaintiff‟s carton and that the carton was
likely to confuse buyers of corn flakes and there was every likelihood of the
consumers purchasing the defendant‟s goods in the belief that they were of the
plaintiff/appellant. The learned Single Judge came to a conclusion that the
trade dress of the defendant in that case was entirely different from
CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 15 of 18 the trade dress of the plaintiff and there is
absolutely no scope for confusion. In the appeal based on the facts, the
Division Bench stated that there were no grounds made out to interfere with
the order of the learned Single Judge refusing injunction.
30\. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff has strenuously urged that
even otherwise the judgment in Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai &
Anr. (supra) is no longer a good law and that this was noted by this Court in
the case of N. Ranga Rao and Sons versus Anil Garg and Ors., 2006 (32) PTC 15.
However, I need not go into this submission in view of the fact that in my
view the Kellogg‟s judgment was made based on the facts that the trade dress
of the defendant was entirely different from the trade dress of the plaintiff
and there was absolutely no scope for confusion.
31\. Another contention which has been strenuously urged by the defendant is
that the defendant claims to have been using velvet pouches for packing its
product since 2008 and claims that the plaintiff has needlessly delayed in
filing of the present Suit and that the defendant has in the meantime carved a
market for itself. This submission has to be rejected. The defendant has not
really been able to show that it has been using identical packaging as that of
the plaintiff since 2008.
32\. As far as the defendant‟s contention is concerned the first thing that
strikes one‟s mind is that there is a complete absence of any attempt to show
the turnover of the defendant in the tea market or the extent of use of the
packaging akin to that of the packaging of the plaintiff.
The defendant has placed on record copies of the invoices which it has raised
for sale of its tea products starting from 2008. A perusal of these invoices
would however show that the defendant is using all kinds of packages for
marketing its product. For example, Invoice No.002 dated CS(OS)No.851/2012
Page 16 of 18 20.08.2008 shows use of velvet pouch, jute pouch, paper mache
box, gift pack, etc. One also cannot help noticing that the defendant has
placed on record three bills from one Kailash Chand dated 28.11.2008,
01.12.2008 and 30.12.2008 stating purchase of velvet bags. The purpose of
these bills is to obviously try and show that the defendant has been using the
velvet pouch since 2008. However, these invoices would show that the bills are
though dated over a period of almost one month, all bear invoice numbers in
sequence. Namely, bill dated 28.11.2008 bears bill No.332, bill dated
01.12.2008 bears bill No.333 and bill dated 30.12.2008 bears bill No.334.
Clearly not much reliance can be placed on these documents. The contention of
defendant cannot be accepted.
33\. Reference now may be had to the observations of the Supreme Court in the
case of Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah & Anr.,(supra) where in
paragraph 13 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-
> "13. In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather essential, to seek an
> injunction, temporary or ad-interim. The principles for the grant of such
> injunction are the same as in the case of any other action against injury
> complained of. The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case, availability of
> balance of convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury
> in the absence of grant of injunction. According to Kerly (ibid, para 16.16)
> passing-off cases are often cases of deliberate and intentional
> misrepresentation, but it is well- settled that fraud is not a necessary
> element of the right of action, and the absence of an intention to deceive
> is not a defence, though proof of fraudulent intention may materially assist
> a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception. Christopher Wad low in
> Law of Passing-Off (1995 Edition, at p.3.06) states that the plaintiff does
> not have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action for
> passing-off. Likelihood of damage is sufficient. The same learned author
> states that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to
> CS(OS)No.851/2012 Page 17 of 18 the existence of the cause of action for
> passing-off (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As to how the injunction granted by
> the Court would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
> Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiff's distinctive trade
> mark or business name, the order may be an absolute injunction that he would
> not use or carry on business under that name, (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97)."
34\. In my view the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of long
continuous user of the trade dress/packaging which is the subject matter of
the present Suit. The nature and extent of the user by the defendant of the
Packaging/Trade Dress which is subject matter of this suit is not clear.
Balance of convenience would hence be in favour of the plaintiff and against
the defendant. The plaintiffs are likely to suffer an irreparable loss and
injury in case, ex parte injunction granted by this Court is not continued.
35\. In view of the above, the present application IA No.5961/2012 is allowed
and the defendant is restrained from selling or dealing with tea products in
packaging using the brand name „BAGAN Fresh‟ which is identical or deceptively
similar to the plaintiff‟s packaging as depicted by the plaintiff in the
documents filed alongwith the plaint and as elaborated in paragraph 5 above
till pendency of the accompanying suit.
36\. IA No.7602/2012 under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC filed by the defendant is
dismissed.

tied around the fabric bag. Lastly the finished and ornamented pack is slipped
