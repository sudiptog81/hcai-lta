(g) The final order : All accused Acquitted
(h) The date of such order : 01.07.2009
(i) Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:­
1\. As many as eight accused namely A1 Mohan Lal, A2 Vinod Kumar, A3 Ajay
Gupta, A4 Rakesh Gupta, A5 Krishan Kumar, A6 Sushil Bajpayee, A7 Mohd. Akhtar
and A8 Pritam Kumar were sent up for trial in this case for the offences u/s.
63 & 68A of The Copyright Act, 1957.
2\. The case of prosecution is that Mr. Sanjiv Kumar, on behalf of Motion
Pictures Association, gave a complaint dated 13.12.1997 to the ACP, Crime
Branch. Contents of the complaint are that complainant Sanjiv Kumar was
authorized by Motion Pictures Association (MPA for short), which is claimed to
be an association of major United States Motion Pictures Company. Motion
Pictures Association authorized MPA to take necessary action against copyright
in the cinematograph films produced by the said companies. The said complaint
was a general complaint against unknown persons. On that complaint, the
Investigating Officer SI Kuldeep Sharma alongwith Satish Kumar, HC Rajbir, Ct.
Kallu Singh, Ct. Mahfooz Alam, Ct. Satbir, Ct. Ramesh and Ct. Rajbir alongwith
complainant Sanjiv Kumar under the supervision of Inspector S.K. Rathee and
ACP Rajan Bhagat proceeded from the Crime Branch office, Delhi, and reached
police post Red Fort. At Red Fort a secret information was received, that
infringement is being conducted at shop no.222­B, Lajpat Rai Market, by the
shop owner Mohan Lal (A1). Few public persons were requested to become
witness, out of which one Rishi Kalra willingly joined the raiding party, the
Investigating Officer handed over Rs.200/­, in the denomination of four
currency notes of Rs.50 each signed by the Investigating Officer, and asked
the public witness Rishi Kalra to purchased the video cassettes of movie
'Bhai' and movie 'Dil To Pagal Hai' from the said shop. Ct. Kallu was deployed
as a shadow witness. The decoy customer Rishi Kalra and shadow witness Ct.
Kallu went to the shop and after some time gave the predetermined signal upon
which the raiding party reached the shop where the decoy customer told the
raiding party that he purchased two video cassettes of those movies from the
occupant of the shop Mohan Lal and he also stated that Vinod Kumar (A2), who
was present in JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of
Copyright Act, 1957/ ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 2 of 8 k the shop brought the
video cassettes and money was received by Mohan Lal (A1). The said currency
notes were recovered from the possession of Mohan Lal (A1) from the pocket of
his shirt. The case property i.e. two video cassettes were seized and, from
the shop 208 more infringed video cassettes of different titles of movies
including Hindi and English movies were also recovered. Ruqqa was prepared and
the present case was got registered.
3\. It is further the case of prosecution that on the disclosure of accused
Mohan Lal and Vinod, A1 & A2, shop no.222­B, Old Lajpat Rai Market, Delhi, was
raided in the presence of shop occupant accused no.3 Ajay Gupta, from where
289 infringed video cassettes were recovered. Shop no.976­A, was also raided
in the presence of occupant Krishan Kumar (A5) from where 24 infringed video
cassettes and 11 pornographic video cassettes were recovered. Shop no.765, was
also raided in the presence of Sushil Bajpayee (A6) from where158 infringed
video cassettes and 23 pornographic cassettes were recovered. Shop no.222B,
was also raided in the presence of occupant Mohd Akhtar (A7), from where 15
infringed cassettes and 14 pornographic video cassettes were recovered. House
no.3062, Gali Topi Wali, Behind Kali Masjid, Turkman Gate, Delhi, was also
raided in the presence of occupant Rakesh Gupta (A4), from where 17 infringed
video cassettes along with 47 VCR, 2 colour TVs and one CD player was
recovered.
4\. Against accused no.8 Pritam Singh, the case of prosecution is that he was
the owner of the first shop from where accused Mohan Lal and Vinod were
arrested and the shop was being run under the name of Pritam Travels.
5\. Accordingly, after completion of investigation, filing of chargesheet and
compliance of section 207 Cr.P.C., charges u/s. 63 & 68A of the Copyright Act,
1957 was framed against all the eight accused by my Ld. Predecessor Court on
23.3.2001. All the eight accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
6\. In support of its case, prosecution examined total five witnesses namely
PW1 HC Kallu JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of
Copyright Act, 1957/ ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 3 of 8 k Singh, PW2 HC Jasbir
Singh, PW3 Sanjiv Kumar, PW4 Satish Kapoor and PW5 C.M. Lall.
7\. PW4 and PW5 are formal witnesses. PW4 Satish Kapoor deposed that he was a
witness of power of attorney executed by Mr. Lowel P. Strong in favour of Mr.
Sanjiv Kapoor, the complainant. He proved the original power of attorney Ex.
PW3/J.
Similarly, PW5 C.M. Lal was a witness to this document Ex. PW3/J executed in
favour of the complainant Mr. Sanjiv Kapoor. Vide this document Ex. PW3/J, Mr.
Lowel P. Strong as Vice President of Motion Pictures Association, authorised
Mr. Sanjiv Kapoor to take appropriate action against infringement of the
copyright work of Motion Pictures company as detailed in schedule­I.
8\. Besides the above two witnesses, prosecution examined three recovery
witnesses i.e. HC Kallu Singh, HC Jasbir Singh, and the complainant Sanjiv
Kapoor PW3 who were members of the raiding party and, who also remained
associated during the recovery effected in this case. Besides the above five
witnesses, no other witness was examined by the prosecution.
9\. All the incriminating evidence was put to the eight accused persons in
their examination u/s.313 P.C., to which all of them denied that any such
recovery was effected from them. The defence of all the eight accused was of
absolute denial. None of the eight accused persons led any defence evidence in
his favour.
10\. I have heard the Ld. APP and I have perused the written arguments
submitted by the counsel for all the eight accused Sh. N.C. Gupta, who partly
advanced arguments orally on 25.5.2009. Since on 25.5.2009, Ld. APP was not
present, therefore, his arguments heard today.
11\. Before proceeding further, let it be mentioned here that in a criminal
trial burden of proving its case lies on the prosecution. It is for the
prosecution to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and it is not for an
accused to prove its defence. Let us see whether the prosecution has proved
its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. Before appreciating the evidence led
by the JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of
Copyright Act, 1957/ ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 4 of 8 k prosecution, let it be
mentioned here that the star witness of prosecution Rishi Kalra, who was
deployed as a decoy customer has not been examined by the prosecution.
12\. Now turning to the testimony of PW1 HC Kallu Singh, he deposed that on
13.12.1997 he joined the investigation of this case and that Rishi Kalra was
made a decoy customer from amongst the public and was given four currency
notes of Rs.50/­ each vide handing over memo Ex. PW1/A and this witness was
deployed as a shadow witness and thereafter the decoy customer purchased the
video cassettes of two movies 'Dil To Pagal Hai' and 'Bhai' from accused Mohan
Lal. Thereafter, the remaining raiding party also reached the spot on the
predetermined signal and seized the currency notes and the two cassettes vide
memos Ex. PW1/B and PW1/C respectively. The witness did not depose anything
about the recovery of 208 cassettes from accused Mohan Lal or the arrest of
accused Vinod from the said shop. When this witness was again examined in
chief further on 25.10.2007 in his examination in chief, only memos i.e.
recovery, personal search memo etc. were exhibited and the witness did not
depose anything about recovery from any of the remaining accused. During the
cross examination of this witness, he specifically stated that he cannot
identify the accused by name and he remained associated in recovery from shop
no.222 only. The witness stated that at shop no. 222, accused Ajay Gupta was
there and the public witness decoy customer gave money to Ajay Gupta and
purchased one cassette from accused Ajay Gupta. He also deposed that Rs.200/­
were recovered from the shop of accused Ajay Gupta. He also deposed that he
did not visit or join the recovery from any other shop on that day. He could
not recollect what was recovered from which shop and stated that he was not
present at the time of sealing of the case property. Now, testimony of this
witness is absolutely against the case of prosecution. As per the case of
prosecution, two cassettes were purchased by the decoy customer from accused
Mohan Lal and recovery was effected from accused Mohan Lal whereas the witness
states that it was purchased from Ajay Gupta and recovery was made from
accused Ajay Gupta. Besides this, this witness materially contradicted other
witnesses about time when the raiding party left the Crime Branch office,
reaching Rajghat, Red Fort and the shop of accused etc. JUDGMENT/STATE VS.
MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957/
ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 5 of 8 k
13\. PW2 HC Jasbir Singh deposed regarding purchase of two cassettes from
accused Mohan Lal by the decoy customer, but the testimony of this witness
that the raiding party was told by the decoy customer that the cassettes were
purchased by decoy customer from Mohan Lal is hit by principle of hearsay
evidence. Besides talking about purchase of two cassettes from accused Mohan
Lal, this witness did not speak about any recovery from any other accused nor
he even deposed about recovery of case property other than two cassettes from
accused Mohan Lal's shop. The case property was not shown to this witness
during his evidence. Therefore, the testimony of this witness is of no help to
the case of prosecution. This witness also materially contradicted other
witnesses regarding time of leaving the Crime Branch office, reaching the
place of recovery etc. The witness in his cross examination deposed that he
does not know the name of cassettes which were recovered nor he know as to who
received money from decoy customer as purchase amount.
14\. During testimony of PW1 & PW2 neither currency notes which were handed
over to the decoy customer and allegedly recovered from accused Mohan Lal were
produced or proved in evidence, nor the two video cassettes which were
purchased by the decoy customer was proved.
15\. PW3 Sanjiv Kumar is the complainant, who proved his complaint and also
deposed about recovery from all the eight accused persons and also the
purchase of video cassettes by the decoy customer from the accused Mohan Lal.
But the testimony of this witness also is not of much help of case of
prosecution for simple reason that Rishi Kalra, the decoy customer was not
examined. What was told by the Rishi Kalra to the members of raiding party
including the complainant PW3 Sanjiv Kumar is barred by the principle of
hearsay evidence. In the testimony of this witness also the currency notes and
the two video cassettes which were purchased were not proved. The case
property which was produced in the testimony of this witness for the first
time in the Court was in unsealed condition. During cross JUDGMENT/STATE VS.
MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957/
ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 6 of 8 k examination, this witness admitted that
since the case property was unsealed and without having any separate bag
numbers, this witness was unable to identify as to from which accused what
infringing material was recovered .
16\. The witness deposed that the secret information was received by the
police and not by him. This fact creates serious doubt about the case of
prosecution since when the complaint was given by this witness to the police,
the police left the Crime Branch office for Lajpat Rai Market and it is at Red
Fort where a secret information is claimed to have been received. In such
circumstances, naturally a question arises in mind as to why the police party
started proceedings towards the Lajpat Rai Market, when they had no secret
information or any other information about this. It may be mentioned here that
the complaint is absolutely silent about any of the accused or even the place
of likelihood of recovery. What made the police party to go towards Lajpat Rai
Market is anybody's guess. It is also not clear whether the deployed source
who gave information to the police at Red Fort was aware that the raiding
party would be reaching there and how the secret informer met the police party
on that day at that time is anybody's guess. It again creates serious doubt.
It may be mentioned that the complainant specifically deposed that he had no
information about this crime and the secret information was received by the
police.
17\. Second thing which creates suspicion is that Rs.200/­ was given to the
decoy customer and the decoy customer was specified that he had purchased
video cassettes of movies 'Dil To Pagal Hai' and 'Bhai'. Now, was the raiding
party members aware that video cassettes of these two movies was available
with the accused Mohan Lal? Why only those two names were specified. Two video
cassettes were allegedly purchased by decoy customer for Rs.100/­ each. Was
the police had prior information that the video cassettes of these particular
movies would be available and for Rs.100/­ each only. If that was the case,
why the investigating agency did not record these things on file. This also
creates serious doubt.
18\. Besides this, PW3 specifically in his cross examination stated that he
cannot identify as to JUDGMENT/STATE VS. MOHAN LAL ORS./ FIR
NO.1184/97/U.S.63,68A of Copyright Act, 1957/ ACQUITTED/01.7.2009 /Page 7 of 8
k which infringed articles belongs to which accused or was recovered from
which accused. It may be mentioned here that in this case, case property was
produced in the Court for the first time in the testimony of PW3 without any
seal and, in absence of proof as to which infringed articles was recovered
from which accused, none of the accused can be found guilty.
19\. Besides this, the provisions of subsection (4) of section 100 of Cr.P.C.
has not been complied with which says that at the time of making search, at
least two local respectable inhabitants of the locality of the place to be
searched shall be joined. Words used is "shall" making it mandatory for the
investigating agency to join such local respectable inhabitant and it is only
where such local respectable inhabitant are unavailable or they refuse to
join, the investigation agency can join other public persons. No local
inhabitant of the place has been joined.
20\. Also after recovery of infringed articles, the case property was never
produced in the Court as required u/s.64 of Copyright Act, 1957.
21\. In view of the above discussion, the prosecution has failed to prove its
case against all the eight accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, all
the eight accused persons are acquitted of the charges. Their surety bonds and
personal bonds are cancelled. Sureties are discharged. Endorsement, if any on
the documents be cancelled. File be consigned to Record Room.
