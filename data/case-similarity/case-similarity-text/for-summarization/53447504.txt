ITA.No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 - A.Ys. 2003-2004 & 2004-
2005
The issues are common for both assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05 under
Appeal by the Revenue. Therefore, we proceed to dispose them jointly by a
common order.
3
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
2\. The assessee company, M/s Alumeco India Extrusion Limited (formerly called
"Pennar Profiles Limited) was engaged in the business of manufacture of
aluminium products. The assessee company filed its return of income for
Assessment Year 2003-04 on 25.11.2003 admitting a loss of Rs.4,37,73,774/-.
The assessee company had transactions with M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH, Germany
whose Managing Director, Mr.WolfgangOrmeloh, was a Director of the assessee
company.
3\. The Assessee company out of abundant caution complied with provisions of
S.92E in obtaining and filing Form 3CEB from the Chartered Accountant against
export sales and purchase of raw materials carried out with M/s O&S Metal
Import GMBH, Germany.
4\. The return of the assessee was processed u/s 143(1) and consequently a
notice u/s 143(2) dated 18.10.2004 was served upon the assessee on 27.10.2004.
During the course of the assessement, the Assessing Officer made a reference
u/s 92CA(1) of the IT Act to the ACIT(TP), Hyderabad. The TPO had rejected the
assessee's TP methods and applied TNMM on the export transactions of the
assessee and had arrived at an ALP adjustment of Rs.1,82,56,357/- to the sales
of the assessee to M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH, Germany
5\. Aggrieved the assessee company filed an appeal before CIT(A)-III. The
Learned CIT(A)-III in his order dealt only with the question on whether the
M/s O&S Metallimport GMBH, Germany was an AE of the assessee company and made
the following observations while concluding that M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH,
Germany was NOT an AE :
4
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
"2.5. I have duly considered the submissions of the Id. AR and of the TPO. The
provisions of transfer pricing regulations provided in Chapter X of the Act
can be invoked only in respect of international transactions between two or
more "Associated Enterprises", which have been exclusively defined in Sec.
92A. The relevant Clauses of Sub-Section (2) invoked by the TPO reads as under
-
"(e) more than half of the board of directors or members of the governing
board, or one or more executive directors or executive members of the
governing board of one enterprise, are appointed by the other enterprise; or
(i) the goods or articles manufactured or processed by one enterprise, are
sold to the other enterprise or to persons specified by the other enterprise,
and the prices and other conditions relating thereto are influenced by such
other enterprise; or
(m) there exists between the two enterprises, any relationship of mutual
interest, as may be prescribed. "
2.6. It is evident from the facts on record that in A.Y. 2003-04, the total
sales made by the appellant were Rs.56.99 Crs. out of which exports made to
M/s. O & S was of Rs.35.57 Crs. only. In A.Y. 2004-05 the total sales were
Rs.56.49 Crs. out of which sales made to M/s. O&S were Rs. 34.77 Crs. The
appellant also made purchases of raw material from M/s. O&S which amounted to
about 70% of the total raw material purchase of the appellant company.
2.7. Clause (e) of Sub-section (2) is applicable where more than half of the
Board of Directors or one or more Executive Directors of one enterprise are
appointed by the other enterprise. It is evident from records that
Mr.WolfgangOrmiloh was not appointed as an Executive Director in the
appellant's Board of Director. Hence, the requirements of Clause (e) are not
fulfilled in this  5 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India
Extrusion Ltd.
case.
2.8. Clause (i) of Sub-section (2) envisages that the goods manufactured by
one enterprise are sold to other enterprise and the prices and other
conditions relating thereto are influenced by such other enterprise. As
mentioned above, the sales made to M/s. 0&5 accounted for about 62% of the
total sales made by the appellant company. The appellant has exported the
goods to other parties on the similar prices and conditions. No evidence is
brought on record by the TPO to show that the prices and other conditions were
influenced by M/s. O&S. There is no denial of the fact that M/s. O&S had no
share holding or control or management in the appellant company. Hence, Clause
(i) of Sec. 92A(L) has no application to the facts of this case.
2.9. Clause (m) of section 92A(2) is applicable only where existed any
relationship of mutual interest between two enterprises, as prescribed under
the Act or by the Board. No such relationship of mutual interest has been
prescribed by the Board till date. Hence, TPO has no authority to invoke the
provisions of clause (m) of Sec. 92A(2) in the case of the appellant".
2.10. In view of the above discussion, I am of the opinion that the appellant
company and M/s.O&S were not the associated enterprises in terms of Sec.92A of
the Act. Hence, the provisions of transfer pricing in Chapter X of the Act
cannot be invoked at the threshold. The appellant cannot be penalized for
making a mistake in filing the statutory report in Form No.3CEB. Whether the
mistake of ignorance of law was on the part of the auditors of the company or
by any executive of the company, is immaterial. It is a trite law that any
non-taxable income cannot be brought to tax even if it is offered for tax by
the assessee himself. It is the duty of the Assessing Officer to levy the
correct tax as per the provisions of the Act. AO/TPO has erred in invoking the
transfer pricing regulations in the present case. The aforesaid grounds raised
by  6 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
the appellant are allowed.
6\. The Learned CIT(A)-III further held that given the M/s O&S Metallimport
GMBH, Germany was not an AE of the assessee company the TP regulations under
the IT Act itself are not applicable in the assessee's case and hence did not
see reason to deal with the other grounds dealing with merits of the
adjustments made in international transactions.
7\. Aggrieved, the Revenue is now in appeal before us.
8\. The Learned DR besides relying upon the grounds of appeal has filed
written submissions wherein it has been stated as follows :
> 1\. With regard to M/s. O&S an associated enterprise or not, two enterprises
> shall be deemed to be associated enterprises is defined in sub section (2)
> of section 92A of IT Act.
> 2\. Under clause (e) of said sub section - more than half of the board of
> directors or members of the governing board, or one or more executive
> directors or executive members of the governing board of one enterprise, are
> appointed by the other enterprise; or
> 3\. Under clause (i) of said sub section - the goods or articles
> manufactured or processed by one enterprise, are sold to other enterprise or
> to persons specified by the other enterprise, and the prices and other
> conditions relating thereto are influenced by such other enterprises: or
> 4\. Under clause (m) of said section - there exists between the two
> enterprise, any relationship of mutual interest, as may be prescribed.
> 5\. As noted by the TPO, Mr. W olfgangOrmeloh is a common director in both
> the Alumeco company as well as the said company M/s. O&S Metalimport, GMBH,
> Germany. He is the Managing Director of that foreign company. The company
> submits that he is not an executive Director and hence the said foreign
> company should not be' treated as an AE in this case. However, it is stated
> that Mr. W olfgangOrmeloh being a full time  7 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009
> and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
> director in the case of the Alumeco Company, it is obvious that he was
> playing an Executive role in the affairs of the Alumeco Company during the
> previous year. The fact of Mr. WolfgangOrmeloh having acted as a full time
> director in the Alumeco company, has been admitted by the assessee company
> vide their letter dated 29/10/2007 filed before the AO. Further, it is seen
> that, there is no such designation as an Executive Director in case of the
> Alumeco Company. In the list of Directors as on 31103/2005, furnished by the
> company, signed by its Secretary, filed with the return, all those six
> persons including Mr. WolfgangOrmeloh are shown as Directors, without any
> specific designation. Under the circumstance, it shows that all those
> directors have role in the functioning and in the affairs of the company
> during the previous year. Further, when the assessee 'company has admitted
> that Mr. WolfgangOrmeloh was a full time director in their case and moreover
> they have not denied such finding given by the TPO that Mr. W olfgangOrmeloh
> was looking after the purchases of raw material from abroad and also was
> looking after the sales made by the company in European market, it clearly
> shows that the said Mr. Wolfgangormeloh was acting as an Executive Director
> in the case of above company. Under the circumstance and having regard to
> the provisions of such clause (e), in my view, the said O&M Metal Import
> GMBH, has to be treated as an AE vis-a-vis the above company, in this case.
6\. As may be seen, in that clause there is no reference to entire goods
manufactured. Thus, it cannot be said that as per the said clause, 100% of
goods manufactured shall have to be sold to the said enterprise. In fact,
having regard to provisions of said clause, in a case where substantial
proportion of goods manufactured by and enterprise is sold to the other
enterprise at prices and other conditions as specified by the letter, under
such circumstances, both the concerns are to be treated as AEs. Since, in this
case not only the above company has purchased substantial quantity of raw
material amounting to Rs.36,12,42,692/- for Asst. Year 2003-04 and
Rs.30,24,06,099/- for the Asst. Year 2004-05 from the said concern, but also
has sold substantial quantity of finished products [62.41 (Asst. Year 2003-04)
78.44% (Asst. Year 2004-05)of the total sales made during the year] shown at
value of Rs. 35,57,36,157/- (Asst. Year 2003-04) and Rs. 35,30,09,614/- (Asst.
Year 2004-05) to the said enterprise, as admitted in the audit report in the
form no. 3CEB filed with the return, in view of said clause (i), the same has
to be treated as an AE Vis-a-vis the appellant company. It is also pertinent
to mention here that, under sub section (2) to section 92A, it says, for the
purpose of Sub section (1), two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated
enterprises if, at any time during the previous year- From this, it shows that
such  8 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
conditions as stipulated in those clauses are not required to satisfied
through out the previous year. Even if, for some period of time during the
previous year, such conditions as per those clauses are satisfied, than the
involved enterprises/companies, shall be deemed to be treated as AEs.
Since, apart from purchasing substantial quantity of raw material, the company
has sold finished products during most part of the previous year to the said
foreign company, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and
such statements of exports made to that concern showing the details of
invoices raised for all the months i.e., form April 2002 to March 2004 during
previous year, it clearly shows that the provision of clause of (i) is
satisfied in the case of the company. Further, form the submission of the
company made before the CIT(A) and AO & TPO that in their case, it was a
purely mutually beneficial commercial relationship existing during such
transactions made in the previous year, it clearly shows that the above
company indirectly admits the role of the said foreign company in influencing
the prices and other conditions during the course of such international
transactions. Under aforesaid circumstances, therefore, both the TPO & Af)
were justified in treating the said foreign company O&M Metal Import, GMBH,
Germany as an AE of the Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
7\. Nowhere mentioned that prescribed authority is CBDT or ACT. It is wrong
interpretation by the CIT or AR that relationship of mutual interest has been
prescribed by the Board till date.
9\. The Learned AR submitted that there was no AE relationship between the
assessee company and M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH, Germany as per Section 92A(2)
and hence there can be no application of TP provisions in the assesse's case.
Without prejudice to this fact, the Learned AR also submitted in detail to the
effect that the TP methods used by the assessee company for both import (CUP)
and export (CPM) were correct and showed clearly that the assessee's
transactions were at arms'-length. The learned AR relied on the decision of
ITAT Mumbai 'E' Bench in the case of Sanchez Capital Services (P) Ltd. vs.
ITO,3(3)(2) (2012) 26 Taxmann.com 61 (Mum.).
9
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
10\. We have heard both Parties.
11\. All the grounds, except Ground 6 which is a general Ground, solely
revolve around the issue whether M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH, Germany is an
Associated Enterprise (AE) of the Appellant company M/s Alumeco India
Extrusion Ltd.
12\. The Learned CIT(A) in his order has analyzed in detail the provisions of
Section 92A "Associated Enterprises" of the Act. The Learned CIT(A) has
observed that none of the relevant sub- sections S.92A(2)(e), 92A(2)(i) and
92A(2)(m) apply to the assessee's company case.
13\. We have gone through the submissions made by both the parties. The
assessee has to establish that the assessee company has exported goods to
other parties on similar prices and conditions. Furthermore, most importantly,
evidences are to be brought on record by the assessee to show that the prices
and other conditions were not influenced by M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH. That
M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH had no share holding or control or management of
assessee company in the impugned assessment year has to be verified by the AO.
. Hence, we remit the issue to the file of the AO to determine whether there
existed an AE relationship between the assessee and M/s O&S Metal Import GmBH
as section 92A(2)(i) is attracted in the instant case.
14\. S.92(A)(2)(m) cannot apply as it is a residual provision to define any
further relationship as AE relationship and such power to define is solely and
absolutely available only with the CBDT. Such power was delegated by the
legislature only to the Competent Authority i.e., CBDT and the CBDT has not
yet  10 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
prescribed any new relationship of mutual interest so as to be covered by
S.92A(2)(m).
15\. With respect to section 92A(2)(e), the assessee company has stated that
Mr. WolfgangOrmeloh was a full time director. Further, the assessee company
has not denied the finding given by the TPO that M/s WolfgangOrmeloh was
looking after the purchases and sales of raw material from abroad made by the
company, in European market. Hence, in these circumstances since there is no
clarity on the issue we remit the issue to the file of the Assessing Officer
to examine in detail the role of Mr. Wolfgang Ormeloh, as the list of
Directors filed with the return shows Mr. Wolfgang Ormeloh as 'Director'
without any specific designation. The Assessing Officer shall investigate as
to whether Mr. Wolfgand Ormeloh was effectively as acting as Executive
Director and decide appropriately whether section 92CA(2)(e) applies in the
instant case.
16\. We also note that as held in Sanchez Capital Services vs. ITO (26
Taxmann.com 61 Mumbai ITAT) the mere filing of Form 3CEB by the assessee does
not automatically imply that S.92A conditions were satisfied and there is an
AE relationship. Rather, the specific facts and circumstances of the case have
to be analysed in order to conclude whether or not an AE relationship actually
exists.
17\. The Revenue's appeals being ITA Nos. 613 & 614/Hyd/09 for both the
assessment year's 2003-04 and 2004-05 are allowed for statistical purposes.
11
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
ITA No. 845/Hyd/11: Assessee appeal - A.Y. 2005-2006
18\. With respect to the assessee's appeal there are 6 Grounds. Grounds 1 and
6 of the assessee's appeal are general in nature and do not require
adjudication.
19\. Grounds 2 & 3 :
> 2\. The learned CIT(A) is not justified in law in coming to the conclusion
> that there is Associated Enterprise (AE) relationship on the assumption that
> Mr. Walfgang Ormeloh is a full time director and was acting like an
> Executive Director in the appellant company which is contrary to the facts.
> Learned CIT(A) ought to have appreciated that there is no AE relationship
> triggering as per provisions of Sec. 92A(1) and (2) of the Act during the
> year.
> 3\. The learned CIT(A) ignored the findings given by the then Ld. CIT(A) in
> A.Y. 2003-04 and 2004-05 that there was no AE relationship between appellant
> company and O & S Metal Import GMBH Germany, though same facts and
> circumstances are prevailing in the current A.Y. 2005-06 which were also
> existing in the earlier two years.
20\. These grounds revolve around the issue whether M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH,
Germany is an Associated Enterprise (AE) of the Appellant company M/s Alumeco
India Extrusion Ltd.
21\. The Learned CIT(A) in his order has stated that "Mr.Wolfgang Ormeloh
being a full-time director in case of the Appellant company it is obvious that
he was playing an Executive role in the affairs of the appellant company
during the previous year........In the list of Directors as on 31.03.2005,
furnished by the appellant....all those six persons including Mr.Wolfgang
Ormeloh are shown as Directors, without any specific designation. Under the
circumstance, it shows that all those directors have role in  12 ITA No. 613 &
614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
functioning and in the affairs of the company during the previous year
2004-05". The Learned CIT(A) has gone on to conclude that said Mr.Wolfgang
Ormeloh's directorship resulted in the German company being an AE.
22\. In the earlier assessment years 2003-04and 2004-05 the same issue arose
whether M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH was an AE of the assessee company because
the AE's Managing Director Mr.Wolfgang Ormeloh was a Director of the assessee
company at para 15, we have held as follows:
> "15. With respect to section 92A(2)(e), the assessee company has stated that
> Mr. Wolfgang Ormeloh was a full time director. Further, the assessee company
> has not denied the finding given by the TPO that M/s Wolfgang Ormeloh was
> looking after the purchases and sales of raw material from abroad made by
> the company, in European market. Hence, in these circumstances since there
> is no clarity on the issue we remit the issue to the file of the Assessing
> Officer to examine in detail the role of Mr. Wolfgang Ormeloh, as the list
> of Directors filed with the return shows Mr. Wolfgang Ormeloh as 'Director'
> without any specific designation. The Assessing Officer shall investigate as
> to whether Mr. Wolfgand Ormeloh was effectively as acting as Executive
> Director and decide appropriately whether section 92CA(2)(e) applies in the
> instant case".
23\. The Learned CIT(A) has also held that S.92A(2)(i) was satisfied because
the said sub-section does not refer to the entire goods manufactured and that
the given the assessee company purchased a substantial quantity of raw
material from the German company as well as exported a substantial quantity of
finished goods to the German company it clearly shows there was a mutual
beneficial interest and hence this clause was satisfied. The Learned CIT(A)
also pointed out that S.92A(2) starts with the phrase "For the purposes of
sub-section(1), two enterprises shall  13 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and
others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
be deemed to be associated enterprises If, at any time during the previous
year" andhence if the clauses under S.92A(2) are satisfied at some point
during the year it is enough to create a deemed AE relationship. Section
92A(2)(i) states that "the goods or articles manufactured or processed by one
enterprise are sold to the other enterprise or to persons specified by the
other enterprise, and the prices and other conditions relating thereto are
influenced by such other enterprise". The assessee has to establish that the
assessee company has exported goods to other parties on similar prices and
conditions. Furthermore, most importantly, evidences are to be brought on
record by the assessee to show that the prices and other conditions were not
influenced by M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH. That M/s O&S Metal Import GMBH had no
share holding or control or management of assessee company in the impugned
assessment year has to be verified by the AO. . Hence, we remit the issue to
the file of the AO to determine whether there existed an AE relationship
between the assessee and M/s O&S Metal Import GmBH as section 92A(2)(i) is
attracted in the instant case.
24\. Therefore Ground Nos. 2 & 3 are allowed for statistical purposes.
25\. With respect to Ground 4 and 5, we are of the opinion that proviso to
section 92C(2) applies to the instant case as the proviso of +/- 5% applies
only if there is more than one comparable price. In the instant case, with
cost plus method (CPM) being applied there are no multiple comparable prices
providing a set or range of prices to be addressed by the +/- 5% range
proviso. Therefore, we dismiss ground No. 4 of the assessee. Ground No. 5 is
consequential and also dismissed.

ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
26\. In the result, appeal of the assessee being ITA No. 845/Hyd/11 is partly
allowed for statistical purposes.
ITA No. 941/H/11: Departmental Appeal - A.Y. 2005-2006
27\. The following are 6 grounds in this appeal.
> "1. The learned CIT (A) erred in adopting the Cost Plus Method (CPM) as
> against the TNMM method adopted by the Transfer Pricing Officer for

28\. In the assessee's appeal in ITA No. 845/H/11, we have remitted the issue
to the file of the AO to determine as to the existence of AE relationship. The
AO has been directed to verify whether section 92A(2)(e) and 92A(2)(i) are
attracted and thereafter decide the issue. Hence, this revenue appeal is also
set  15 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
aside to the AO to decide after adjudicating the assessee's appeal.
29\. Hence this appeal of the Revenue being ITA No. 941/Hyd/11 is allowed for
statistical purposes.

16
> ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
31\. As regards ground No.2, the TPO has held that the internal CPM method
adopted by the assessee (as well as the alternate of internal TNMM supplied by
it) for exports to its AE is incorrect and applied external TNMM instead to
arrive at an arm's-length adjustment of Rs.3,51,83,477/-. The DRP has not
passed any detailed order and has merely confirmed the findings of the TPO.
32\. At the outset we note that the assessee company has been following the
CPM method for exports to AE consistently over the years and that we have
upheld the same in the assessment year 2005-06.
33\. Furthermore, the undisputed fact is that the assessee has reasonably
significant sales to non-AE's (domestic sales) of similar products. The
assessee therefore has these internal domestic transactions, which are similar
to its export transactions, to benchmark against its AE transactions. In such
a scenario, we find that internal CPM is justified and much more appropriate
in arriving at the proper ALP than applying external TNMM and comparing it
with different transactions of other companies. Our view is supported by
various decision which are as follows :
> (i) Birla Soft (India) Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA No. 3839/Del/2010).
> (ii) Destination of the World Sub-continent Pvt. Ltd. 47 SOT
> 1\.
> (iii) Technimount ICB Pvt. Ltd. 11 Taxmann.com 49 (Mum.)
34\. In the case of Birla Soft the Delhi ITAT has held as follows :
> "In the light of the discussions made above, it was to be held that the
> assessee was justified in undertaking internal bench/marking analysis on  17
> ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
> stand/alone basis by placing on record working of operating profit margin
> from international transactions with AEs and transactions with unrelated
> parties undertaken in similar functional and economic scenario, and the same
> should be the basis for determination of arm's length price in respect of
> international transactions undertaken with the associated enterprise. In the
> light of the facts of the instant case as discussed above, it was to be held
> that the TPO had no mandate to have recourse to external comparables when,
> in the instant case, internal comparables were available, which could be
> applied for determining the arm's length price of international transactions
> with AEs. Therefore, the Assessing Officer/TPO was directed to determine
> arm's length price of international transactions with AEs by making internal
> comparison of the net margin earned by the assessee from the international
> transactions with associated enterprises and the profit earned by the
> assessee from the international transactions with unrelated parties."
35\. There is also merit to the assessee's argument that it is a sick company
in BIFR and hence has economic conditions and business circumstances which are
unique to it. It would seem erroneous to compare such a loss-making company,
at least without non-trivial adjustments, to various other companies
performing activities in the same domain via external TNMM especially when
readily available internal transactions are there as a benchmark.
36\. Finally, we note that the TPO has tried to dismiss the internal CPM for
incorrect allocation of costs - this by itself cannot be the reason for
rejecting the CPM method itself. If anything, the allocation of costs may be
looked into and be computed correctly.
18
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
37\. In other words, when the assessee has chosen a Most Appropriate Method
(MAM) and substantiated the choice in its TP study, we feel that it is up to
the TPO to record and substantiate the reasons as to why the assesse's MAM is
incorrect and why some other TP method needs to be the Most Appropriate Method
(MAM). In the instant case however we do not find any substance in any of the
TPO's multiple arguments for rejection of assessee's internal CPM and adoption
of external TNMM.
38\. We further point out that in the ruling of the Supreme Court in DIT
(Intl. Taxation) vs. Morgan Stanley (292 ITR 416) it was held that "the most
appropriate method has to be applied for computation of the arm's-length
price. It will depend on facts and circumstances of each particular
international transaction....".Applying this ratio, considering the facts and
circumstances in the instant case, internal CPM seems to be the Most
Appropriate Method (MAM) rather than external TNMM.
39\. Therefore, we hold that the TPO's cursory dismissal of CPM and
application of external TNMM is unfounded. However the allocation of costs to
domestic, export and jobwork activities needs to be re-examined in detail. We
therefore set aside the order to the AO/TPO to compute the ALP of the
assessee's transactions using internal CPM as submitted by the assessee and to
calculate the appropriate allocation of direct and indirect costs of the
assessee to its domestic, export and jobwork activities.
40\. As regards Ground No. 3, as noted in above paragraphs, we find merit in
the assessee's argument that being a sick company under BIFR it would be
erroneous to compare it cursorily using external TNMM. We feel that in such a
circumstance, correct  19 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India
Extrusion Ltd.
comparability analysis would be a non-trivial exercise and the entire TNMM
application is bound to be sub-optimal. Given that internal CPM is available
and easily applicable in the instant case, we do not find merit in applying
external TNMM in the instant case. Hence this ground is allowed in favour of
the assessee.
41\. As regards Ground 4, this ground does not need adjudication as the
external TNMM application is held incorrect and internal CPM is to be adopted
in the assessee's case.
42\. As regards Ground 5, we direct the AO to compute and arrive at the total
income after providing appropriate adjustment of brought forward losses.
43\. In the result, the appeal being ITA No. 1475/Hyd/10 is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.
ITA.No.2070/Hyd/2011 - Assessee's Appeal - A.Y. 2007-
2008
44\. There are 8 grounds before us which are as under. Grounds 1 and 8 are
general in nature and do not need adjudication.

45\. As regards Grounds 2, the TPO has held that the internal CPM method
adopted by the assessee (as well as the alternate of internal TNMM supplied by
it) for exports to its AE is incorrect and applied external TNMM instead to
arrive at an arm's-length adjustment. The DRP has upheld the order of the TPO
with respect to applying external TNMM.
46\. The learned DR besides relying upon the grounds of appeal has filed
written submissions wherein it has been stated as follows :
> Regarding Adoption of method, It is Worthwhile to reproduce the observations
> of the Hon'ble Supreme in the case of OIT (lnt. Taxation) vs. Morgan Stanley
> 292 ITR 416 Where the court held  21 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others

vs. The DCIT, Circle 1 (3), Hyderabad dated 9 t h September, 2011.
In view of the above discussion, TNMM is selected as the most appropriate
method. In view of the above, it is humbly prayed that the Hon'ble Bench may
reverse the orders of Ld. CIT (A) and upheld the orders of assessing officer.
47\. The learned A.R. submitted that the assessee-company has been following
the CPM method for exports to AE consistently over the years and that we have
upheld the same in the assessment year 2005-06.
48\. Furthermore, it was submitted that the undisputed fact is that the
assessee has reasonably significant sales to non-AE's (domestic sales) of
similar products. The assessee therefore has these internal domestic
transactions, which are similar to its export transactions, to benchmark
against its AE transactions. In such a scenario, it was submitted that
internal CPM is justified and much more appropriate in arriving at the proper
ALP than applying external TNMM and comparing it with different transactions
of other companies. The assessee relied on the decision of the decision of the
Delhi ITAT in Birla Soft (India) Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA No. 3839/Del/2010) wherein
the Bench held as follows:
> "In the light of the discussions made above, it was to be held that the
> assessee was justified in undertaking internal bench/marking analysis on
> stand/alone basis by placing on record working of operating profit margin

49\. We heard both parties. We find that internal CPM is justified and
appropriate in arriving at the proper ALP than applying external TNMM and
comparing it with different transactions of other companies.
50\. We also find merit in the assessee's argument that it is a sick company
in BIFR and hence has economic conditions and business circumstances which are
unique to it.
51\. The assessee pleaded that companies with less forex earnings should be
removed and also brought to our notice the following decisions:
> (1) DCIT, Mumbai vs. M/s. Indo American Jewellery Ltd. Mumbai (2010) 41 SOT
> 1 (Mum.) (2) M/s. CRM SDervices India (P) Ltd. (2011) TII-86-ITAT- Del-TP

> (4) ACIT, Range 7 (2) vs. M/s. Rhoida Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd.
> ITA.No.4201/Mum/2007.
52\. We are of the opinion that it would seem erroneous to compare such a
loss-making company, at least without non-trivial adjustments, to various
other companies performing activities in the same domain via external TNMM
especially when readily available internal transactions are there as a
benchmark.
53\. Finally, we note that the TPO has tried to dismiss the internal CPM for
incorrect allocation of costs - this by itself cannot be the reason for
rejecting the CPM method itself. If anything, the allocation of costs may be
looked into and be computed correctly.
54\. In other words, when the assessee has chosen a Most Appropriate Method
(MAM) and substantiated the choice in its TP study, we feel that it is up to
the TPO to record and substantiate the reasons as to why the assesse's MAM is
incorrect and why some other TP method needs to be the Most Appropriate Method
(MAM). In the instant case however we do not find any substance in any of the
TPO's multiple arguments for rejection of assessee's internal CPM and adoption
of external TNMM.
55\. We further point out that in the ruling of the Supreme Court in DIT
(Intl. Taxation) vs. Morgan Stanley (292 ITR 416) it was held that "the most
appropriate method has to be applied for computation of the arm's-length
price. It will depend on facts and circumstances of each particular
international transaction....".Applying this ratio, considering the facts and
circumstances in the instant case, internal CPM seems to be the Most
Appropriate Method (MAM) rather than external TNMM. The  25 ITA No. 613 &
614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
assessee has relied on the decision of ACIT vs. MSS India 32 SOT 132 (Pune)
wherein it has been held that In a situation in which the assessee has
followed one of the standard methods of determining ALP, such a method cannot
be discarded in preference over transactional profit methods unless the
revenue authorities are able to demonstrate the fallacies in application of
standard methods. In any event, any preference of one method over the other
method must be justified by the Transfer Pricing Officer on the basis of
cogent material and sound reasoning.
56\. Therefore, we hold that the TPO's cursory dismissal of CPM and
application of external TNMM is unfounded. However the allocation of costs to
domestic, export and job-work activities needs to be re-examined in detail. We
therefore set aside the order to the AO/TPO to compute the ALP of the
assessee's transactions using internal CPM as submitted by the assessee and to
calculate the appropriate allocation of direct and indirect costs of the
assessee to its domestic, export and job-work activities. Hence this ground is
allowed in assessee's favour for statistical purposes
57\. As regards Ground 3, we have provided detailed reasoning in Ground 2 as
to why internal CPM is the Most Appropriate Method and not external TNMM.
Hence this ground is held in favour of the assessee.
58\. As regards Ground 4, this ground does not need adjudication as the
external TNMM application is held incorrect and internal CPM is to be adopted
in the assessee's case.
26
ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
59\. As regards Ground 5, We have already adjudicated this issue in Grounds 2
and 3 and hence this ground is allowed in favour of the assessee.
60\. As regards Ground 6, it is clear that any adjustments during the
computation of the arm's-length price should be restricted only to the
international transactions and not to the entire turnover of the assessee. It
is illogical to make additions to local transactions based on TP adjustments
and any such addition to entire transactions of the assessee will go against
the principle and the provisions of TP under the Indian IT Act. Our view finds
support on various decisions which are as follows :
> (1) ACIT vs. Givaudan Flavours (India) P. Ltd. 45 SOT 35 (Mum.) (2) Starlite
> vs. DCIT 201-TII-28-ITAT (Mum.)
61\. In the case of Lionbridge Technologies (P) Ltd. vs. DCIT (23 taxmann.com
373 Mumbai ITAT) the ITAT observed as follows:
> "7. It is axiomatic that the transfer pricing adjustment can be made only
> with reference to the international transactions with the AEs and not non-
> AEs. Special provisions relating to the computation of income from
> international transactions were introduced through sections 92 to 92F by the
> Finance Act, 2001 with a view to provide a statutory frame work which can
> lead to the computation of reasonable profits and taxes in India in case of
> international transactions between enterprises of a multi-national group.
> The object of these provisions is to ensure that the transactions between
> two AEs are not arranged in such a manner so as to reduce the incidence of
> tax due in India. Such object is  27 ITA No. 613 & 614/Hyd/2009 and others
> Alumeco India Extrusion Ltd.
> achieved by determining ALP as per the relevant provisions of the Act, which
> is then compared with the price at which international transactions are
> actually entered into and recorded in the books of account. The difference
> between the ALP and the actual price, if leading to the lowering of income
> due in India, is added by way of transfer pricing adjustment. From the
> scheme of Chapter X of the Act, containing the sections as afore-referred,
> it is manifest that the addition on account of transfer pricing adjustment
> can be made only in respect of international transactions with the AEs and
> not the non-AEs. It is quite natural also because there can be no scope for
> arranging the transactions with non- AEs so as to reduce the due tax in
> India. That is the reason for which the transactions with non- AEs have been
> excluded from the ambit of Chapter X of the Act".
62\. Hence, the AO is directed to restrict the adjustments, if any, only to
international transactions. This Ground is allowed in favour of the assessee.
63\. As regards Ground 7, we do not believe that for CPM there is a need for
provision of +/- 5% range of the arm's-length price as there are no comparable
prices in the instant case providing a set or range of multiple prices to be
addressed by the +/-5% range. Hence this ground of the assessee is dismissed.
64\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee being ITA No. 2070/Hyd/11 is
partly allowed for statistical purposes.
