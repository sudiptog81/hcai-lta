The present petition is for a direction on the Registrar to make over the
entire amount held by the Registrar to the first defendant since the suit has
been dismissed by an order of September 12, 2012.
Since the plaintiff has shown no interest in the matter despite attempts of
service at the plaintiff's recorded address and the publication of the notice
in the  3 newspaper pursuant to the order dated January 29, 2016, GA No.3420
of 2015 is allowed by directing the Registrar, Original Side to make over the
deposit of about Rs.1.75 crore together with the interest accrued thereon to
the first defendant by way of a demand draft of any nationalised bank made out
in the name of the first defendant. The entire payment will be made within
four weeks from date, upon the Registrar retaining the usual commission.
It is made clear that this order is only for the purpose of the refund of the
amount and it will be open to the first defendant to pursue any other remedy
against the plaintiff in accordance with law.
Mr. T. Aich, Adv.

first defendant had attempted to serve a covering letter along with the copy
of the papers pertaining to this petition on the plaintiff at Esplanade

claims that there is no existence of the plaintiff at the relevant address. In

subsisting thereon was vacated. The order dated May 10, 2011 left it open to
the first defendant "to take out an application for refund of the amount
deposited by the first defendant that now remains with advocate representing
the plaintiff."
A further order of July 26, 2011 recorded the submission of advocate formerly
representing the plaintiff. Advocate for the plaintiff had been appointed
receiver for the purpose of holding the sum of Rs.1.50 crore. The amount was
directed to be invested in a short-term fixed deposit. The order of July 26,
2011 recorded the submission of advocate for the plaintiff that he had no
instructions in the matter. The order required the receiver to deposit the
entire amount of about Rs.1.75 crore together with the interest accrued
thereon with the Registrar, Original Side and for the receiver to stand
discharged thereupon. The deposit has been made with the Registrar, Original
Side.
