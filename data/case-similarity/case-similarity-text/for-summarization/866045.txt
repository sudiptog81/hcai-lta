ORDER Chandrashekaraiah, J.
1\. The petitioner are the owners of the certain extent of lands situated at
Bellary. The said lands were proposed for acquisition in a preliminary
notification dated 17.7.1989 issued under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition
Act (hereinafter called L.A. Act). The said notification was followed by a
final notification dated 22.8.1990 issued under Section 6(1) of the Act. These
two notifications have been challenged by the petitioners in these Writ
Petitions.
2\. Learned Counsel for petitioners contended that under the Karnataka Urban
Development Authorities Act, 1987, (hereinafter called U.D.A. Act) the 4th
respondent Bellary Urban Development Authority may initiate the proceedings
for acquisition of the land for the purpose of implementing the development
schemes framed by it and when such being the case it is not appropriate for
the State Government to initiate the proceedings under the provisions of the
ascertain whether the Land Acquisition Officer has afforded opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner pursuant to the objections filed by them, I called
upon the Learned Government Pleader, to produce the records, Accordingly the
G.A. produced the records to the Court. From the records, it is seen that on
25.10.1989, the advocate for the petitioners has filed his written arguments
and thereafter it was adjourned to 8.11.89 to produce certain documents. On
8.11.1989, no proceedings have been taken place. This shows that there is
nothing on records to show that the petitioners were heard pursuant to their
objections. Learned Counsel for the Board submitted that the petitioners were
heard by the Land Acquisition Officer. This argument cannot be accepted
because from the records produced by the Learned Government Advocate, nothing
is available to show that the petitioners were heard by the Land Acquisition
Officer. Under these circumstances, the final notification issued under
Section 6(1) of the Act is liable to be quashed. Accordingly, I pass the
following Order:
ORDER The Writ Petitions are allowed. The final notification dated 22.8.1990
the State Government to initiate the proceedings under the provisions of the
Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of formation of sites by the Urban
Development Board.
In order to appreciate the above contention it is useful to refer to certain
facts of the case. In the instant case, the State Government issued the
notifications under the Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of distribution
of the sites by the Bellary Urban Development Authority. This notification is
called in question by the petitioners in these petitions on the ground that
the Government has no power to acquire the land under the provisions of the
L.A. Act, where there is a specific enactment called U.D.A. Act, under which
the State Government may acquire the land for the purpose of implementing the
development schemes. In order to consider the same, it is necessary to refer
to certain provisions of the L.A. Act. Section 3(f) defines the public
purpose. Section 3(f)(iii) reads as follows:-
"the provision of land for planned development of land from public funds in
pursuance of any scheme or policy of Government and subsequent disposal
thereof in whole or in part by lease, assignment or outright sale with the
object of securing further development as planned;"
Section 3(f)(vii) reads as follows:-
"the provision of land for any other scheme for development sponsored by
Government, or, with the prior approval of the appropriate Government, by a
local authority;"
The reading of the above said Sections it is dear, that any acquisition of
land for the above said purpose is a public purpose. In the instant case, the
land was proposed for acquisition for the purpose of formation of sites with a
view to implement the scheme sponsored by the Government through the Urban
Development Authority. Therefore, it is a public purpose.
3\. Section 15 of the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987
confers the powers on the authority to undertake works and incur expenditure
for development, etc. Sub-section (1) of Section 15 provides that the
authority may draw up detailed scheme for the development of the Urban Area.
Sub-section (2) provides that the authority may also from time to time take up
any new or additional development schemes. Sub-section (3) of Section 15 reads
as follows:-
"Notwithstanding anything in this Act or in any other taw for the time being
in force, the Government may, whenever it deems fit necessary require the
Authority to take up any development scheme or work and execute it subject to
such terms and conditions as may be specified by the Government."
The reading of the above Section, it is dear that the authority may not only
execute the scheme framed by it, but also undertake any of the schemes as
required by the State Government. In the case on hand, the Government proposed
for acquisition of land requiring the said land for the purpose of
implementing the developmental scheme sponsored by the State Government
through the 4th respondent which is a public purpose under the provisions of
the L.A. Act. Therefore, it is permissible under the provisions of the L.A.
Act to acquire the land for the purpose of getting scheme implemented through
the Urban Development Authority, as the said Authority is constituted not only
to implement the scheme framed by it but also to execute the scheme entrusted
to it by the State Government.
4\. Learned Counsel for petitioner relied on the following decisions:-
i) PATNA IMPROVEMENT TRUST v. SMT LAKSHMl DEVI AND ORS .;
ii) B.T. SAKKU v. THE COMMISSIONER, BANGALORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, BANGALORE
AND ANR .
iii) THE LAND ACQUISITION OFFICER, CITY IMPROVEMENT TRUST v. H. NARAYANAIAH,
ETC .
iv) HANUMANTHAPPA v. STATE OF KARNATAKA ILR 1987, Pg 3024;
v) Y. MAHESH v. MYSORE URBAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY , in support of his
contention that when there is a specific procedure under the Urban Development
Authorities Act, for acquisition of the Land the said procedure are required
to be followed as the Scheme is required to be implemented by the U.D.
Authority. It is true that the Scheme is required to be implemented by the
U.D. Authority, under the Scheme of the U.D.A. Act, the Authority is
constituted, as stated earlier, not only to implement its Scheme but also to
execute the scheme entrusted to it. In the instant case, land was notified for
acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act. Therefore the procedures
prescribed under the said Act are required to be followed. It is not the case
of the petitioners that the procedure prescribed under the L.A. Act for the
purpose of acquisition of land has not been followed. Therefore, the above
said decisions are not applicable to the facts of these cases.
5\. The Supreme Court in Case of PATNA IMPROVEMENT TRUST v. SMT. LAKSHMI DEVI
, has held that the amendment introduced cannot take away or exclude the
provisions of Land Acquisition Act, such as Section 4, 6, 50 etc. for the
purpose of acquisition of Trust. In view of this decision, I am of the opinion
that there is no substance in the contention of the petitioner.
6\. In these Writ Petitions, the Learned Counsel for petitioner submitted that
they have filed objections to the proposed acquisition of land pursuant to the
preliminary notification; thereafter the Land Acquisition Officer without
affording any opportunity of hearing to the petitioners submitted the report
to the State Government under Section 51 of the Act. The State Government on
the basis of the said report, issued the final notification under Section 6(1)
of the L.A. Act; which according to the petitioners is illegal. In order to
ascertain whether the Land Acquisition Officer has afforded opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner pursuant to the objections filed by them, I called
upon the Learned Government Pleader, to produce the records, Accordingly the
G.A. produced the records to the Court. From the records, it is seen that on
25.10.1989, the advocate for the petitioners has filed his written arguments
and thereafter it was adjourned to 8.11.89 to produce certain documents. On
8.11.1989, no proceedings have been taken place. This shows that there is
nothing on records to show that the petitioners were heard pursuant to their
objections. Learned Counsel for the Board submitted that the petitioners were
heard by the Land Acquisition Officer. This argument cannot be accepted
because from the records produced by the Learned Government Advocate, nothing
is available to show that the petitioners were heard by the Land Acquisition
Officer. Under these circumstances, the final notification issued under
Section 6(1) of the Act is liable to be quashed. Accordingly, I pass the
following Order:
ORDER The Writ Petitions are allowed. The final notification dated 22.8.1990
is quashed in so far as it relates to the lands of the petitioners reserving
liberty to proceed with the acquisition after affording opportunity of hearing
to the petitioners on the objection filed by the petitioners pursuant to the
preliminary Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act.
