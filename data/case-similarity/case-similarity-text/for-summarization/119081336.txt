    3. The Tribunal, by its common judgment and

    mentioned as Rs.3,28,200/-) on account of the injuries

'_l'}'iel said claim petition had come up before the ﬂfribunal on 05"" June
2004. The Tribunal on i' 'assessment of oral and documentary evidence and
other érnaterial available on file, taking into consideration age //we 5 and
avocation of the appellant, has allowed the claim petition in part and awarded
compensation of Rs.3.18.200/- under different heads with interest at the rate
of 6% p.a. from the date of petition till the date of deposit. The appellant
being dissatisﬁed quantum of compensation awarded by
the__*i':rib'Az:i"nfai~.:i presented this appeal seeliing compensation.
6\. We have heard leajrized counsel :"_foir-iaippiellanti and learned counsel
for" dresponde'nt7VInsurance Company.
:"'A.?_'&. i' pf . the learned counsel for the appellantﬁatv Vth__eA3_outset
is that the Tribunal has coinamittevd gra«v.e....«error in not awarding just

compensation towards loss of xamuenities, loss of future income, future
medical Aiweicpenses and loss of marriage prospects, without taking %/ 1'
9\. After careful consideration of the submissions made by the learned counsel
for both parties, the only point that arise for our consideration is as to
"Whether the of compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just and
reasonablef?o'»T_"ll'up
10\. On careful perusal of the material and impugned judgement 8: awa_r,dn,_it
em}-;'rgéis; not in dispute that the appellant accident on 16.06.1999":_an_d

position to work as efficiently as he v":'as'i~ doing earlier and he has
difficulty in walking. all these relevant factors into consideration, we «L /
I 8 can fairly assess the disability at 35% in respect of whole body, to meet
the ends of justice.
11\. The Tribunal has failed to taltejyinto consideration, the nature and
duration o;t'""'trea_t1n;_ent undergone by the appellant. The..,..ap'pell-ant
has undergone pain and agony during tréa.tf£1pe'iipt'--an*d' to undergo
discomfort, unhappin'e_ss during 1é;;;s'tl of his life. On account of

expenses. Further, the Tribunal has erred in not"'--.awarding compensation
towards loss of . 1'amenities,"discomfort and unhappiness. Therefore. we "
award a sum of Rs.50,000/- towards pain and as against Rs.40,000/- awarded by
the Tribunal: a sum of Rs.20,000/~ towards conveyance, nourishing food and
attendant charges as against '"iRs.15,000/--: a sum 0 Rs.2-4,000/~ towards
loss of 9 income during laid up period; a sum of Rs.40,000/- towards loss of
amenities, discomfort and unhappiness; a sum of Rs.30,000/-- towards loss of
marriage prospects and a sum. of Rs.20,000/- towards future medical expenses.
12\. So far as the compensation awarded by the Tribunal towards.._mecEicaili'
concerned, the same is just and ré:as*onah1e; _ "l'her'ef_ore, it does not
call for interfereri'ce.
