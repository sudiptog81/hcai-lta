                                            ORDER
This appeal filed by the revenue is directed against the order of Ld.
CIT(Appeals) - 9, Kolkata dated 09.08.2016 and the solitary issue involved
therein relates to the disallowance of Rs. 41,59,000/- made by the A.O. and
confirmed by the Ld. CIT(A) u/s 40(a)(ia) for non- deduction of tax at source
from the payment of printing charges.
2\. The assessee in the present case is an association of paediatric doctors.
During the year under consideration, a journal was published and distributed
by it to the members free of cost. The expenditure for printing of the said
journal was claimed to be financed from sponsorship fees. In the return of
income filed for the year under consideration on 26.11.2013, surplus of Rs.
4,58,880/- was offered to tax by the assessee. During the course of assessment
proceedings, it was noticed by the A.O. that the assessee has paid printing
charges of  2 I.T.A. No. 2355/Kol/2017 Assessment Year: 2013-14 Pediatric
Infectious Diseases Academy Rs. 41,59,000/- to M/s. Reed Elsevier India Pvt.
Ltd. without deduction of tax at source as required under section 194C. In
this regard, it was explained by the assessee that there was no business
carried on by it and the surplus generated from the activity of publication of
journal was shown under the head 'income from other sources'. It was contended
on behalf of the assessee before the A.O. that the provision of section
40(a)(ia) therefore was not applicable even if there was failure to deduct tax
at source from printing charges under section 194C. This contention of the
assessee was not found acceptable by the A.O. According to him, as per the
proviso to section 2(15) of the Act, the activity of publication of journal
carried on by the assessee was in the nature of business and the income from
the said activity was chargeable to tax under the head profits and gains of
business or profession. He, therefore, held that the printing charges of Rs.
41,59,000/- paid by the assessee without deduction of tax at source u/s 194C
were liable to be disallowed u/s 40(a)(ia). He accordingly made a disallowance
to that extent in the assessment completed u/s 143(3) vide an order dated
15.03.2016.
3\. Against the order passed by the A.O. under section 143(3), an appeal was
preferred by the assessee before the Ld. CIT(A). During the course of
appellate proceedings before the Ld. CIT(A), it was contended on behalf of the
assessee that the proviso to section 2(15)relied upon by the Assessing Officer
was not applicable in its case as the activity of publication of journal was
not in the nature of trade, commerce or business. It was reiterated on behalf
of the assessee that the said activity was financed from sponsorship fees and
the journals published were issued to the members free of cost. It  3 I.T.A.
No. 2355/Kol/2017 Assessment Year: 2013-14 Pediatric Infectious Diseases
Academy was contended that the A.O., therefore, was not justified in
classifying the surplus from the said activity as business income instead of
income from other sources and making a disallowance u/s 40(a)(ia) for non-
deduction of tax at source from the payment of printing charges. The Ld.
CIT(A) did not find merit in this contention of the assessee. He held that the
assessee being a charitable organisation was of no relevance for the
applicability of section 40(a)(ia) and the A.O., therefore, was fully
justified in invoking the said provision to make the disallowance. Aggrieved
by the order of the Ld. CIT(A), the assessee has preferred this appeal before
the Tribunal.
4\. I have heard the arguments of both the sides and also perused the relevant
material on record. It is observed that the assessee in the present case is an
association of paediatric doctors with the principal object of general public
advancement. It is duly registered under the West Bengal Society Registration
Act, 1961 as well as under section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. During the
year under consideration, it had published journal from the funds received
from sponsorship fees and the journals so published were issued to the members
free of cost. The surplus from the activity of publishing journal was offered
to tax by the assessee under the head 'income from other sources' and when the
disallowance was sought to be made by the A.O. u/s 40(a)(ia) for non-deduction
of tax at source from the payment of printing charges, it was claimed by the
assessee that the said provision could be invoked only why computing income
under the head 'profits and gains from business or profession'. The A.O.
however treated the surplus of the assessee from the activity of publication
of journal as its business income by relying on the proviso  4 I.T.A. No.
2355/Kol/2017 Assessment Year: 2013-14 Pediatric Infectious Diseases Academy
to section 2(15) and made a disallowance on account of printing charges u/s
40(a)(ia). As rightly contended on behalf of the assessee before the Ld.
CIT(A) as well as before the Tribunal, the activity of publication of journal
having been financed from the sponsorship fees and the said journals having
been issued to the members free of cost, the same cannot be treated as in the
nature trade, commerce or business as envisaged in the proviso to section
2(15) and the income of the assessee from the said activity cannot be treated
as its business income. I, therefore, find merit in the contention of the
learned counsel for the assessee that the A.O. was not justified in re-
classifying the income of the assessee from the activity of publication of
journals as business income and in making a disallowance u/s 40(a)(ia).
5\. In my opinion, the Ld. CIT(A) is also not justified in holding that the
fact of the assessee being the charitable organisation is of no relevance for
the applicability of section 40(a)(ia). As pointed out by the learned counsel
for the assessee, this view taken by the Ld. CIT(A) is contrary to the
decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Bombay Stock Exchange
vs DDIT 365 ITR 181 wherein it was held that where the income of the assessee
was exempt under section 11 and the assessee was not carried on the business,
section 40(a)(ia) had no application. Moreover, the insertion of Explanation 3
to Section 11 by the Finance Act, 2018 making inter alia the provisions of
Section 40(a)(ia) applicable in case of charitable or religious trust or
institution with effect from 1st April, 2019 further shows that section
40(a)(ia) hitherto was not applicable in computing income of entities
registration u/s 12A of the Act. I, therefore, hold that the  5 I.T.A. No.
2355/Kol/2017 Assessment Year: 2013-14 Pediatric Infectious Diseases Academy
disallowance made by the A.O. under section 40(a)(ia) and confirmed by the Ld.
CIT(A) is not sustainable and deleting the same, I allow this appeal of the
assessee.
6\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Order Pronounced in the Open Court on 24th May, 2018.
