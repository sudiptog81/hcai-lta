                                      ORDER
PER SMT BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER Present appeal has been filed by
assessee against final assessment order dated 31/01/17, passed by Ld. DCIT
(TP)-2 (2) (2) for assessment year 2012-13 on following grounds of appeal:
> 1.The orders of the TPO/ DRP/ Assessing Officer in so far as they are
> against the appellant, are opposed to law, IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  2 weight
> of evidence, natural justice, probabilities, facts and circumstances of the
> appellant's case.
2.The appellant denies itself to be assessed on a total income of
Rs.5,58,10,708/- as against income of Rs. 4,92,53,041/- declared by the
appellant.
3.a) The order of the assessment is bad in law as the mandatory conditions to
invoke the jurisdiction under section 92CA of the Act did not exist, or having
not been complied with and consequently the order of the assessing officer is
bad in law for want of requisite jurisdiction.
b) The assessing officer erred in not providing the copy of the approval
granted by the Commissioner which is in violation of the settled principles of
natural justice and thus the order of assessment needs to be set aside.
4.The addition of Rs. 64,16,427/- being adjustment under section 92CA of the
Act made by the assessing officer is bad in law and thus the addition made
needs to be deleted on the facts and circumstances of the case.
5\. The TPO, DRP and the AO erred in rejecting the comparables selected by the
appellant without giving any cogent reasons.
6\. The TPO, DRP and the Assessing Officer erred in --
a) Rejecting the TP study of the appellant.
b) Rejecting the use of multiple year data while arriving at appropriate
comparables.
c) Rejecting companies having different financial year ending.
d) Rejecting companies that have export sales less than 75% of the sales
e)Rejecting companies that have sales from ITES less than 75% of the total
operating revenue.
f) Not applying reasonable employee cost filters.
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  3
g) Applying related party filter at 25% of sales.
7.The TPO and the AO ought to have restricted the upper limit of turnover at
10 times that of the assessee as held by the. Jurisdictional Tribunal in the
case of ACIT vs. McAfee Software (India)(P.) Ltd., reported in
8\. Without prejudice, the TPO and AO ought to have applied the turnover
filter of Rs. 1 crore to Rs.200 crores for selection of comparables as held by
the Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. M/s. Pentair Water India Pvt.
Ltd., reported in 381 ITR 216.
9.The TPO and the AO erred in selecting companies with super-profit margins
namely TCS E-Serve Ltd., Universal Print Systems Ltd.(Seg), B N R Udyog Ltd.
and thus the ALP margin computed is wrong and consequently the orders of TPO &
AO need to be cancelled on the facts of the case.
10.a)The authorities below failed to appreciate that the company Universal
Print Systems Ltd. is functionally dissimilar and thus erred in treating the
same as comparable on the facts of the case.
b)The authorities below erred in treating Excel Infoways as comparable on the
facts of the case.
c)The authorities below erred in treating BNR Udyog Ltd. as comparable on the
facts of the case.
d)The DRP erred in rejecting Informed Technologies India Ltd. as comparable
though it is functionally similar to that of the appellant on the facts of the
case.
11.The comparables Infosys BPO Ltd. and E4e Healthcare Business Services Pvt.
Ltd. selected by the TPO needs to be excluded as they do not pass the turnover
filter, although they formed part of the assessee's original comparables on
the facts of the case. Reliance is placed on the decision of
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  4 Chandigarh Tribunal (Special Bench) in the case of
DCIT vs. Quark Systems Pvt. Ltd., reported in 38 SOT 307.
12\. The TPO and the AO erred in selecting external comparables over internal
comparables of the assessee under the facts and circumstances of the case.
13.a) The TPO and the AO erred in making negative working capital adjustment
of -030% to the arithmetic mean of the comparable companies in determining the
Arm's Length Price relating to international transactions of the assessee.
b)Without prejudice, even if any working capital adjustment is to be made,
only a positive adjustment has to be made to the comparables.
14\. The TPO, DRP and the AO failed to appreciate that the appellant being a
captive service provider runs a 'single customer risk'.
b) The TPO, DRP and the AO further erred in not appreciating that the
appellant renders services only to their parent company and thus suitable risk
adjustment needs to be made in case of the appellant under the facts and
circumstances of the case.
15\. The TPO, DRP and the AO failed to understand the spirit and intent of
Rule 10B(1)(e)(ii) as per which even if one of the comparables selected by the
appellant satisfies the computation mechanism for determination of the ALP,
the determination of ALP by using arithmetic mean of different comparables is
not warranted under the facts and circumstances of the case.
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  5
16\. The TPO, DRP and the Assessing Officer erred in not granting the benefit
of the proviso to section 92C(2) of the Act which is mandatory under the
scheme of the Act.
17.The appellant denies itself liable to be levied to interest under sections
234B and 234C of the Act and further the computation of interest under
sections 234B and 234C was not provided to the appellant as regard to the
rate, period and method of calculation of interest under the facts and
circumstances of the case.
18.The appellant craves leave to 'add, alter, delete, and modify any of the
grounds which are urged above.
19.For the above and such other grounds as may be urged at the time of
hearing, the appellant prays your Honour to consider the facts and
circumstances of the case and justice rendered.
The additional grounds raised by assessee are as under:
The appellant begs to submit the under mentioned additional grounds of appeal
which were not urged specifically in the original grounds of appeal filed at
the time of institution of appeal. These grounds do not involve any
investigation of any facts otherwise on the record of the department and
therefore, it is prayed that the additional pounds may kindly be admitted and
disposed off on merits for the advancement of substantial cause of justice.
Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
National Thermal Power Co. Ltd. Vs. CIT reported in 229 ITR 383 and on the
decision of Mysore High Court in the case of Gundathur Thimmappa & Sons CIT
reported in 70 ITR 70.
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  6
1\. The authorities below erred in treating TCS E-serve Limited as a
comparable company though it is functionally different to that of the
appellant on the facts of the case.
2\. The authorities below erred in treating Infosys BPO Limited as a
comparable company though it is functionally different to that of the
appellant on the facts of the case.
3.The comparable Infosys BPO Ltd. selected by the TPO needs to be excluded as
it is functionally different, although it formed part of the assessee's
original comparables on the facts of the case.
2\. It has been submitted that comparables alleged for exclusion in Additional
Ground were raised before DRP, however, in advertently the same was missed out
while filing present appeal before this Tribunal. Placing reliance on decision
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of NTPC Ltd Vs CIT reported in 229 ITR 383,
and Jute Corporation of India Vs CIT reported in 53 Taxmann.85 prayed for
admission of additional grounds. Ld. CIT DR though, opposed the admission
could not controvert submissions of ld.AR.
3\. We have perused records in light of submissions advanced. In our
considered view it is observed that these comparables were alleged by assessee
before authorities below for exclusion. Considering inadvertent mistake, in
raising these comparables assessee to raise them now. Accordingly, Additional
Ground raised by assessee vide application dated 10-07-2018 stands allowed.
4\. Brief facts of the case are as under:
Assessee is a company engaged in business of software development, IT enabled
and BPO service providers. Return of income for year under consideration was
filed on 29/09/12 IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  7 declaring total income of
Rs.4,92,53,040/-. Return was processed under section 143(1), subsequently case
was selected for scrutiny and notice under section 143(2) was issued to
assessee. In response to statutory notices, assessee appeared before Ld. AO
and filed requisite details as called for. Ld.AO observed that assessee
entered into international transaction during year under consideration with
associated enterprises and therefore case was referred to transfer pricing
officer.
Ld.TPO upon receipt of reference under section 90 2C of the Act, issued notice
to assessee calling upon to file economic details of international transaction
in Form 3CEB. Ld.TPO from transfer pricing report observed that assessee
renders IT enabled services to Inspinity and Software Development Services to
SPI LLC. It was observed that assessee was providing backend customer care and
administrative services to U.S.-based clients from healthcare and financial
services sectors.
Ld.TPO observed that assessee entered into following international transaction
with its AE's:
    Particulars                                                     Amount
    Medical transcription service                                        3,45,71,603
    Provision of Software Services                                      55,66,75,560
It was observed that assessee used TNMM as most appropriate method by using
OP/OC as PLI and computed its margin under software development services at
15.84% and ITeS Services (BPO division) at 12.36%. Assessee used 11
comparables for software development services and 9 comparables in respect of
IT enabled IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  8 services. It has been submitted that only
disputed segment by Ld.TPO, is IT enabled service segment.
For IT enabled service segment assessee used following 9 comparables with an
average margin of 15.27%:

Average PLI 28.11 Ld. TPO thus proposed adjustment of Rs.47,61,028 for IT
enabled service segment.
5\. Aggrieved by proposed adjustment, assessee preferred objections before
DRP. DRP though upheld most of the IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  9 comparables
selected by Ld. TPO, however excluded Accentia Technologies based on
functional differences. DRP also excluded M/s informed technologies India Ltd
though it was not objected by assessee.
Upon receipt of DRP directions Ld. AO passed final assessment order by making
an addition of Rs.64,16,427/-as TP adjustment. L.AO also disallowed donation
claimed by assessee is expenses amounting to Rs.1,41,240/-.
6\. Aggrieved by order passed by Ld. AO, assessee is in appeal before us now.
It has been submitted that Ground No. 1,4 & 18-19 are general in nature and
therefore do not require any adjudication. 7 Ground No. 5-16 along with
Additional Ground 1-2 are in respect of comparables alleged to be
excluded/included by assessee.
Assessee placed before us chart, wherein following comparables are sought to
be exclude/include Comparables sought to be excluded:
 Universal Print Systems Ltd (segmental) (BPO)  Infosys BPO Ltd  TCS
E-Serve Ltd  BNR Udyog Ltd (segment) (medical transcription)  Excel Infoways
Ltd (segmental) (IT) (BPO) Comparables sought for inclusion  Informed
Technologies India Ltd Before we undertake comparability analysis, it is sine
qua non to understand functions performed, assets owned and risk assumed by
assessee under the segment:
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  10 Functions In the TP study, it is observed that
assessee is categorised under broad head of medical transcription. It has been
submitted therein that assessee serves various industries like medical, legal,
business, education.
Medical transcription services has been further streamlined into to further
division called medical transcription and medical coding. Under these segments
assessee provides outsourcing services to companies in U.S. healthcare systems
with assistance from companies in-house information technology division. Under
medical coding segment assessee assists U.S. Healthcare Medical Billing
Companies and medical providers to obtain proper reimbursement due for their
services.
Assets employed:
It has been submitted that assessee owns routine assets like computer
equipment, network equipment, software and applications. It is also been
submitted that assessee does not own any nonroutine valuable intangible
assets. Risks assumed:
It has been submitted that assessee acted merely as sub contractor of services
and therefore it bears limited contract risk as compared to SPI LLC. Assessee
however assumes substantial foreign currency fluctuation risk, as it deals
with customers in various countries. As assessee works on an assured markup on
all cost incurred towards rendering services and there is no price risk bone
by assessee.
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  11 Thus assessee has been concluded to be not assuming
any unique or extraordinary risk in course of providing IT enabled services.
Based upon above FAR analysis of assessee, we shall consider comparables
alleged by assessee for exclusion/inclusion.
Comparables sought to be excluded:
8\. Universal Print Systems Ltd (segmental) (BPO) Assessee sought to exclude
this comparable for reason that, it fails employee cost filter and has
insufficient company information. It is also been submitted that, functionally
this company is providing integrated print solution to its customers and does
not provides routine ITeS services like that of assessee. It has been
submitted that this company is not a captive service provider like that of
assessee and has products sale as well as services sale, which is evident from
page 579 of paper book volume II.
8.1 Ld.CIT DR placed reliance upon orders of authorities below and submitted
that this comparable is functionally comparable with that of assessee.
9\. We have heard submissions advanced by both sides in light of record placed
before us. On perusal of annual report of this company placed in paper book,
we are of considered opinion that this comparable is basically into sale of
products and services unlike a captive service provider such as assessee, who
works on cost plus basis, providing services only to its AE's. It is also
observed that this comparable is basically providing BPO services from its
Prepress units. In written submission filed, assessee placed reliance upon
decision of this Tribunal in case of Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd., vs ACIT reported
in (2019) 101 taxman.com IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  12 292, wherein this
comparable has been excluded by observing as under:
> 10.4 We heard rival submissions and perused the material on record. The
> issue of comparability of universal Print Systems Ltd. with that of the
> assessee-company has been duly considered by TPO after referring to
> information contained in Annual Report. The relevant findings of the TPO had
> not been countenanced by learned AR of the assessee. However, the issue of
> comparability of Universal Print Systems Ltd. has also been considered by
> the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of CGI Information
> Systems & Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (supra) wherein it was held as
> follows:
> "47. The next submission of the learned counsel for the Assessee was with
> regard to exclusion of 2 comparable companies from the list of 7 comparable
> companies that remain after the order of the DRP. The first comparable
> company sought to be excluded is Universal Print Systems Ltd. This company
> was chosen as a comparable company by the TPO. In reply to the proposal of
> the TPO to include this company as a comparable company, the Assessee vide
> its letter dated 22.12.2015 had pointed out its objections to including this
> company as a comparable company. A copy of the said objection is at page-785
> of the Assessee's paper book. The Assessee pointed out that the OP TC of
> this company as worked out by the TPO at 59.40% was wrong and unallocated
> costs as per the annual report should be allocated to BPO segment and if
> that is done then the OP TC of this company will be only 51.80%. The
> Assessee further pointed out (Page 764 of paper book) that the TPO had
> applied revenue filter of more than 75% being from non-
financial service income. The Assessee pointed out that the percentage of
income from ITES was only 21.6% of the total revenue from operations of this
company as per its annual report. The .Assessee also pointed out that in the
Pre-press IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  13 BPO segment this company was providing
integrated print solutions to its customers, which includes scanning,
design/layout, trapping, hand-outlined clipping path and image masking and
magazine and catalogue publishing. The Assessee submitted that the aforesaid
services are not in the nature of ITES. The Assessee pointed out that as per
the safe harbour rules introduced by the CBDT ITES has been defined as
business process outsourcing services provided mainly with the assistance or
use of information technology. It was also submitted that this company does
not satisfy the definition of ITES as contained in Rule IOTA(e) of the Rules.
Since use of information technology is absent .in the various services
provided by this company, it cannot be regarded as ITES company. The Assessee
also submitted that this company fails the employee cost filter. The employee
cost filter requires that the employees cost incurred by the company must be
more than 25% of its revenue.
48\. The TPO at page-20 of his order has dealt with the above objections by
observing as follows:
> (a) Pre-Press BPO unit provides back office support services.
> (b) This company has four major segments viz., Repro, Label Printing, Offset
> Printing and pre-press BPO. The employee cost of pre-press BPO was more than
> 25% of the revenue from pre-press BPO and therefore the employee cost filter
> is satisfied in the case of this company.
> (c )On the service revenue filter viz., the requirement that a comparable
> company must have revenue from rendering services of more than 75% of its
> total revenue, the TPO again held that the pre-press BPO segment's entire
> income IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  14 is from services and therefore this
> objection is not to be accepted.
49\. On objections by the Assessee before the DRP, the DRP confirmed the
action of the TPO. One of the objection before the DRP was that this company
did not figure in the list of companies engaged in ITES. On this objection the
DRP held that though this company did not figure in the list of companies in
1TES in the main search of capital line and prowess database but on a
segmental search these two companies satisfied the requirement of being
considered as companies engaged in providing ITES.
Aggrieved by the directions of the DRP, the Assessee is in appeal before the
Tribunal. The learned counsel for the Assessee reiterated submissions that
were made before the TPO/DRP. In particular it was submitted that the service
revenue filter was applied by the TPO himself at the entity level and on such
search this company was not regarded as engaged in providing ITES. At this
stage the TPO ought to have dropped this company as a comparable company
because this filter has to be applied at the entity level and not at the
segmental level. The learned DR submitted that if the service revenue filter
isapplied at the segmental level there can be no objection by the Assessee.
She relied on the order of the DRP/TPQ.
50\. The requirements of Rule 10B(1)(2) & (3) of the Rules in the matter of
comparability of companies under TNMM needs to be seen. The same reads as
follows:
> "10B. (1) For the purposes, of sub-section (2) of section 92C, the arm's
> length price in relation to an international transaction shall be determined
> by any of the following methods, being the most appropriate method, in the
> following manner, namely: --
> IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  15
> (a) to (d). ******
> (e) transactional-margin method, by which,
> (i) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise from an international
> transaction entered into with an associated enterprise is computed in
> relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be
> employed by the enterprise or having regard to any other relevant base;
(ii) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise or by an unrelated
enterprise from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such
transactions is computed having regard to the same base;
(iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (if) arising in
comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the
differences, if any, between the international transaction and the comparable
uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such
transactions, which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in
the open market;
(iv) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise and referred to in sub-
clause (i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to
in sub-clause (iii):
(v)the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account an arm's

responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions:
d)conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to the
transactions operate, including the geographical location and size of the
markets, the laws and Government orders in force, costs of labour and. capital
in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and
whether the markets are wholesale retail (3) An uncontrolled transaction shall
be comparable to an internatiorial
(i) none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared
or between the enterprises entering into such transactions are likely
materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit arising
from such transactions in the open market; or
(ii) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material
effects of such differences."
5.2.There appears to be no bar in the Rules referred to above to considering
segmental data under TNMM because the comparison is of "net profit margin
realized by the enterprise from an international transaction" with the "net
profit realized from a comparable uncontrolled IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  17
transaction". Therefore comparison is of similar transaction. When segmental
information is available and is not disputed, it cannot be argued that filters
have to be applied at entity level. It cannot be argued that when the TPO
himself applied the filters at the entity level he was not entitled to apply
the filters at segmental level. As we have already stated if clear segmental
information is available the filters can be applied at the segmental level in
TNMM. Therefore the objection with regard to this company failing the employee
cost filter and service revenue filter in our view was rightly rejected by the
TPO and DRP. It is however seen that this company has four segments viz.,
Repro. Label Printing, Offset Printing and Pre-press BPO. Whether the label
printing and offset printing segments supplement the functions performed in
the Pre-press BPO segment has to be seen. We therefore set aside the order of
the DRP in this regard and remand for fresh consideration by the TPO the
comparability of this company. In terms of Rule 10B(3) of the rules the profit
margins of Pre-Press BPO have to be adjusted taking into account the fact that
two other segments supplement the pre-press BPO segment. If such adjustment
cannot be reasonably or accurately made then this company has to be excluded
from the list of comparable companies. The TPO for this purpose can use his
powers u/s. 133(6) of the Act to get required details from this company. As
far as the argument that this company fails functional comparability, we find
that none of the objections raised the Assessee in this regard about lack of
information about allied services performed by the pre-press BPO segment of
this company and the break-up of the revenue from such allied services have
been dealt with specifically by the TPO or DRP. Since the comparability of
this company is being remanded to be TPO for consideration of adjustments as
mentioned above, IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  18 the objection with regard to
functional comparability should also be looked into by the TPO in the remand
proceedings on the basis of materials which he may gather u/s. 133(6) of the
Act, The Assessee should be given opportunity of being heard by the TPO before
the issue is decided by the TPO.' Respectfully following the decision, we
remand this comparable to the file of the TPO/AO for fresh adjudication on the
above lines.
Respectfully following aforesaid decision, we remand this comparable to file
of Ld.AO/TPO, for fresh adjudication, on the basis of directions reproduced
hereinabove. Needless to say that proper opportunity shall be granted to
assessee as per law.
Accordingly we set aside this comparable back to Ld.TPO.
9\. Infosys BPO Ltd.
Assessee objected for inclusion of this comparable primarily on the basis of
functional incompatibility and presence of intangibles. It has been submitted
that this company owns huge brand and not a fit comparables for company like
assessee, who provide captive service to its AE's.
10\. Ld. CIT DR opposed the exclusion and placed reliance upon orders passed
by authorities below.
11\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the
records placed before us. Assessee placed reliance upon decision of this
Tribunal in case of Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd., IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  19 vs ACIT
vide order dated 28/06/19 in ITA (TP) a No. 1661/Bang/2016, wherein this
comparable has been excluded by observing as under:
> '5. We have heard the rival submissions on the comparability of Infosys BPO
> as a comparable company. The Delhi ITAT in the case of Baxter India Pvt.
> Ltd. Vs. ACIT ITA No.6158/Del/2016 for AY 2012- 13 in the case of a company

From above, it is clear that this company is functionally not comparable with
captive service provider.
Respectfully following the same we direct this company to be excluded from
final list.
12\. TCS e-Serve Ltd.
Ld. AR submitted that this company has been objected by assessee for its
functional dissimilarity as it renders both BPO IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  21 and
KPO services without segmental reporting. It is submitted that this company
owns huge brand of TATA group and has also incurred brand related expenses and
therefore cannot be accepted to be compared with a captive service provider
like assessee.
13\. Ld.CIT DR on the contrary opposed its exclusion and placed reliance upon
orders passed by authorities below.
14\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. Assessee placed reliance upon following decisions in support
of its argument for exclusion of this comparable:
 Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs ACIT (supra)  Baxter India Pvt. Ltd vs ACIT
reported in (2017) 85 Taxmann.com  285 (Delhi-Trib)  PCIT vs BC Management
Services Pvt. Ltd. reported in TS- 948-HC-
 2017 (Del)-TP It is observed that this comparable has been excluded by this
Tribunal. Assessee placed reliance upon decision of this Tribunal in case of
Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd., vs ACIT reported in (2019) 101 taxman.com 292, by
observing as under:
> "11.3 We have heard rival submissions and perused material on record. The

"2. COMPANY OVERVIEW Your Company, along with its subsidiary companies - TCS
e-Serve International Limited and TCS e-Serve America Inc., is primarily
engaged in the business of providing Business Process Services (BPO) for its
customers in Banking, Financial Services and Insurance domain.
The Company's operations include delivering core business processing services,
analytics & insights (KPO) and support services for both data and voice
processes.
Your Company is an integral part of the Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS)
strategy to build on its 'Full Services Offerings' that offer global customers
an integrated portfolio of services ranging from IT services to BPO services.
The Company provides its services from various processing facilities, backed
t) a robust and scalable infrastructure network tailored to meet clients'
needs. A detailed Business Continuity Plan has also been put in place to
ensure the services are provided to the customers without any disruptions.
Thus, this company is also stated to be a K n o wl e d g e P r o c e s s O u
ts o u r c i n g an d th e r ef or e f or I'- reasons stated by us while deal
ing with this issue of comparability of the company Infosys BPOLtd. shall
equally hold good and th e r e f o r e we d i r e c t th e A O / T P O to e x
c l u d e th is company f rom : list of compar ables.' Since the
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  23 appellant company is into low end BPO, it cannot be
compared with KPO service provider.
11.4 Respectfully following the decision of the co-ordinate bench of Tribunal,
we direct for exclusion this company from the list of comparable".
It has been observed that this company is into high-end KPO services and an
assessee rendering low end BPO services cannot be compared with it. Further,
this company has been excluded due to absence of segmental information.
Respectfully following aforesaid decision, we direct Ld.TPO to exclude this
company from the list of comparables.
15\. BNR Udyog Ltd. (segmental) 15.1 Ld.AR submitted that this company fails
RPT filter and also fails export filter applied by Ld.TPO. It is submitted
that this company is into medical transcription, coding, business support
services and e-governance projects and therefore functionally not similar with
that of assessee.
16\. Ld. CIT DR however contended that this company is compared only for
segment of medical transcription and therefore should not be excluded. She
placed reliance upon decision of this Tribunal in case of Mobily Infotech
India (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2018) 97 taxman.com 2 in support.
17\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the
records placed before us.
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  24 Assessee is challenging functional dissimilarity of
this company with that of assessee as it is into medical transcription. We
have our reservation to consider medical transcription services to be one of
KPO services. In our considered opinion medical transcription services is
basically back-office services provided by graduates who are trained for short
period of 6 months to one year. These are short crash courses undertaken by
graduates who are trained to understand and speak English. There is no value
addition in the services rendered by people in medical transcription. To our
understanding, basically these people who carry out medical transcription
services are trained to understand language spoken by doctors, outside India
to whom medical reports of patience are sent for expert opinion. Medical
transcriptionist simply reproduces opinion expressed by Doctor, which is then
communicated to the patients.
It is observed from annual report placed at page 934 of paper book Volume II
that this company has segmental information of medical transcription and
revenue earned under this segment is Rs.147.40 Lacs. It is also been observed
that various other decisions by co-ordinate Benches of this tribunal has
remanded this comparable back to Ld.TPO, for proper analysis and fresh
consideration. We draw support for same from Indegene (P) Ltd vs ACIT reported
in (2017) 85 Taxmann.com 60, wherein it has been held as under:
> "9.3.1. We have heard the rival contentions and perused and carefully
> considered the IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  25 material on record including the
> judicial pronouncements cited. From the details on record we observe that
> while the assessee has contended that the services rendered by this company
> M/s TCS E-serve Ltd are high end KPO services, it has not brought out as to
> which of these are the services that would come under technical services. On
> the other hand, w also notice that that the TPO has held all the services
> rendered by the assessee to be BPO services with any proper analysis. In
> this factual matrix of the case, we find that on similar facts, the co-
> ordinate Bench o ITAT Bangalore in the case of Indegene (P) Ltd., (supra)
> has remanded the matter of comparability of this company to the file of the
> TPO for fresh consideration. In view of the factual matrix of the case on
> hand, as laid out above and following the decision of the co-
ordinate Bench in the case of Indegene (P) Ltd. (Supra) which is also rendered
on similar facts, we deem it appropriate to remand the matter of the
comparability of this company, TCS E-serve Ltd. To the file of the TPO for
fresh consideration in the light of out abov observations. Needless to add,
the TPO shall afford the assessee adequate opportunity of
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  26 being heard and to file details/submissions in this
regard.
It is also been observed that similar view has been taken by decision of this
Tribunal in case of M/s Nielson Sports India Pvt.Ltd., Vs ACIT in IT(TP)A
No.196(B))/2017 vide order dated 28- 06-2019.
Respectfully following the same, we set aside this comparable back to Ld.TPO
for considering it afresh. Needless to say that proper opportunity shall be
granted to assessee as per law.
Accordingly we set aside this comparable back to Ld.TPO
18\. Excel Infoways Ltd. (segmental) This comparable elected by ld.TPO is
alleged to be functionally not comparable with assessee, as it is handling
business relations and managing customer relationships. It has been submitted
by Ld.AR that this comparable fails employee cost filter.
19\. Ld.CIT DR however contended that this company is compared only for
segment of medical transcription and therefore should not be excluded. She
placed reliance upon decision of this Tribunal in case of Mobily Infotech
India (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2018) 97 taxman.com 2 in support.
20\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. Annual report of this company is placed at page 984 of paper
book Volume II. In the Significant Accounting Policies reported at page 1018
of paper book, it is IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  27 observed that companies
operating businesses are organized and managed separately, according to nature
of business and services provided with each segment, representing different
strategic business unit. Note 15 at page 1023 to refers to revenues from
operations under the head information technology/BPO related services
separately. It is observed that the function performed by this company as
reported at page 996 reveals that it is engaged in business of providing
customer care services and handling client business relations on their behalf
by maintaining relation with customers and also providing services by
assisting in managing the workflow and updating the records. It is observed
that this Tribunal in case of Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd., vs ACIT vide order
dated 28/06/19 in ITA (TP) a No. 1661/Bang/2016, this comparable is excluded
by observing as under:
> " The third and last company that is sought to be excluded from the list of
> comparable companies is Exclusion of Excel Info Ltd. The Tribunal had
> retained this company as a comparable company in its original order. The
> assessee sought exclusion of this company on the ground that this company
> was functionally different from the assessee company and the employee cost
> to the revenue was less than the threshold limit of 25% and that there were
> peculiar economic circumstances which impacted the profit margin of this
> company thereby rendering this company as not comparable company. The
> Tribunal while adjudicating of exclusion of this company in paragraph 14.3
> of its order held that on application of employee cost filter that the
> Assessee has failed to IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  28 show as to how the findings
> of the TPO and DRP are not correct.
3\. The assessee has pointed out certain facts with regard to employee cost
and diminishing revenue of this company which takes it out of the
comparability and these aspects have not been considered by the Tribunal in
its order. On the above objections in the MA, the Tribunal held as follows:-
"8. We have examined the contents in the misc. petition and we find that there
has been omission to consider the application of employee cost filter by the
Tribunal though attention of the Bench was invited to relevant pages pointed
out in the misc. petition. We do not however agree with the assessee that
functional comparability of this company has not been examined by the Tribunal
in paragraph 14.4. The Tribunal has come to the conclusion that this company
is a ITeS company and that cannot be reviewed in the misc. application.
However there has been omission to adjudicated exclusion of this company on
account of extraordinary events. We therefore recall the order of the Tribunal
to the limited extent of examining of the employee cost filter and the
presence of extraordinary events on warranty exclusion of this company."
4\. We have heard the rival submissions on the exclusion of this company on
the basis of extraordinary events that occurred during the relevant previous
year which had impact on the profit margin of this company and therefore
rendering this company from being chosen as a comparable company. The Delhi
ITAT in the case of BT e-Serve (India) Ltd. Vs. ITO ITA No.6690/Del/2016 for
AY 2012-13 order dated 19.6.2018 considered the comparability of this
IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  29 company and came to the conclusion in paragraph 5.4
of its order that there was abnormal volatility of revenue of this company
from 2009-10 to 2014-15 and therefore this company should not be regarded as
comparable company. Respectfully following the aforesaid decision, we direct
exclusion of the aforesaid company from the list of comparable companies
chosen by the TPO.
5\. It is observed from order passed by Ld.TPO at page 10 that assessee
objected this company that employee cost filter being more than 25% has not
been examined by Ld.TPO. It is observed that in decision of coordinate bench
of Delhi Tribunal in case of Baxter India private limited vs ACIT reported in
(2017) 85 Taxmann.com 285 this comparable failing employee cost filter has
been analyzed as under:
> Further, from the order of the TPO we find he has obtained the employee cost
> and the sale for the ITES segment by exercise of his powers u s. 133(6).
> wherein the said company has allocated entire employee cost to IT - BPO
> segment with no allocation to Infra Activity segment which accounts to 49%
> of Excel's total revenue. In our opinion. it is highly impractical that no
> employee has been hired by Excel for Infra Activity segment. We. therefore.
> find merit in the argument of the Id. counsel for the assessee that the
> information provided as per section 133(6) by Excel Infoways Ltd. is
> unreliable and should not be used to compute employ ee cost for ITES
> segment. The Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Motorola Solutions
> India (P.) Ltd. v. Assts. CIT[2014] IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  30 48 taxmann.com
> 24842015] 152 ITD 158 (Delhi) has held that a company should be rejected as
> comparable in case there is contradiction in the facts or data sourced from
> annual report and as per the information gathered u/s. 133(6). In view of
> above discussion, we hold that Excel Infoways Ltd. cannot be considered as
> comparable and should be excluded from the list of comparables. We hold and
> direct accordingly".
From the above observation by coordinate bench, objection raised by Ld.CIT DR
stands clarified, as this company for year under consideration made a
statement under 133 (6) regarding allocating entire employee cost to IT-BPO
segment, with no allocation to other segment, which amounts to almost 49% of
its total revenue during the year under consideration. At this stage, we
clarify that, we are not inclined to express our opinion regarding functional
similarities/dissimilarity of this company with that of present assessee
before us and the same is kept open to be considered in an appropriate case.
We therefore agree with contention raised by assessee regarding this
comparable not satisfying employee cost filter. Respectfully following
aforestated decision of Delhi Tribunal reproduced hereinabove, we direct
Ld.TPO to exclude this comparable from the final list.
21\. Comparable sought for inclusion:
21.1 Informed Technologies India Ltd.
It has been submitted by Ld.AR that this company is functionally comparable
with that of assessee and submits that it passes IT(TP)ANo.630(B)/2017  31
through all filters applied by Ld.TPO. It has been submitted that this
comparable was included by Ld.TPO which was acceptable to assessee. However
DRP directed to exclude the same, as there was no segmental detail available.
22\. Ld.CIT DR however placed reliance upon order of DRP and supported its
exclusion due to non-availability of segmental information.
23\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of
records placed before us. It is observed that this comparable has been not
disputed for functional dissimilarity by DRP. However the observation that
segmental informations are not available needs to be verified. We are
therefore of considered opinion that, this comparable needs to be set-aside to
Ld.TPO for verification afresh. Needless to say that assessee shall be granted
proper opportunity as per law to represent its case.
We thus set aside this comparable back to Ld.TPO. Accordingly, these grounds
raised stands allowed as indicated above. Ground No.17 I in respect of
interest u/s 234B & 234C of the Act, which is premature at this stage.
In the result, appeal filed by assessee stands allowed as indicated above.
