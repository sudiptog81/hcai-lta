    HEADNOTE:
         For the  accounting year  ending on  31st March,  1961,
    corresponding to the assessment year 1962-63, the Income-tax
    Officer did  not accept the assessee's accounts showing cash
    credit of  Rs.1,50,000 said  to have been received by way of
    loans from  three individual  creditors. He  produced before
    the Income-tax	Officer, discharged hundies and confirmation
    letters from these creditors who were income-tax assessees.
    The assessee made attempts to bring the creditors before the
    Income-tax Officer  by issue  of notices  under s.131 of the
    Income-Tax Act, 1961 but failed, as these were returned with
    the  endorsement  'left'.  The	assessee  thereafter  wanted
    further opportunity  to find  out  the	whereabouts  of	 the
    lenders.   The	  Income-tax   Officer	  observed   certain
    inconsistencies in  the confirmation  letters which  did not
    inspire confidence,  and being	of the view that the alleged
    creditors were	not  genuine  bankers  but  were  mere	name
    lenders, treated  the entire  amount as unproved cash credit
    and added  the same  to the  income  of	 the  assessee.	 The
    assistant appellate Commissioner dismissed the appeal of the
    assessee.
         In a  separate proceeding	under a.271(1)(c) of the Act
    on  the	  basis	 of  the  assessment  order  the  Inspecting
    Assistant  Commissioner imposed a penalty of Rs.50,000.
         The Tribunal  came to  the conclusion  that the Revenue
    was
    980
    not justified  in  drawing  adverse  inference	against	 the
    assessee. It  was of the view that if the assessee could not
    produce the  persons alleged to be the creditors, it did not
    lead automatically  to the adverse inference that the amount
    represented undisclosed	 income of  the assessee.  It  found
    that the creditors were income-tax assessees and while being
    assessed they  had mate	 statements  before  the  respective
    Income-tax Officers  admitting that they were allowing their
    names to be lent, without actually giving loans as creditors
    of different  assessees. The Tribunal also could not sustain
    the imposition	of penalty. The Revenue sought for statement
    of the	case to	 the High Court on the aspect of addition of
    unproved cash  credit to  the total  income of the assessee,
    and also  on the  imposition of	 penalty but  the  same	 WAS
    refused. The  High Court  also	refused	 to  accede  to	 the
    prayers of  the Revenue in its application under 8.256(2) of
    the Act.
         In the  appeals before  this Court	 on  behalf  of	 the
    Revenue it  was contented  that in view of the provisions of
    8.68 of	 the Act the onus in these types of cases was on the
    assessee, and  in this	case the assessee had not discharged
    that onus.
         Dismissing the appeals, the Court,
    ^
         HELD : 1.(i) The High Court has no power under 8.256(2)
    of the 1961 Act to call upon the Appellate Tribunal to state
    a case	if there  was some  evidence to	 support the finding
    recorded by  the Tribunal,  even if  it appears	 to the High
    Court that  on a  re-appreciation of  the evidence, it might
    arrive at  a conclusion different from that of the Tribunal.
    [987 D-E]
         (ii) The  conclusion reached  by the  Tribunal  in	 the
    instant case,  that the	 assessee had  discharged the burden
    that lay  on him  could not  be said  to be unreasonable, or
    perverse or based on no evidence. If the conclusion is based
    on some	 evidence on  which  it	 could	be  arrived  at,  no
    question of law as such arises. [987 G-H]
         (iii) The assessee had provided the names and addresses
    of the	alleged creditors.  It was  in the  knowledge of the
    Revenue that  they were	 income-tax assessees.	Their  index
    numbers were  in the  files of	the department.	 The Revenue
    apart
    981
    from issuing notices under 8. 131 of the Act at the instance
    of the	assessees, did not pursue the matter further. It did
    not examine the source of income of the alleged creditors to
    find out  whether they	were credit-worthy  or were such who
    could advance the alleged loans. There was no effort made to
    pursue	the   so-called	 alleged  creditors.  The  assessee,
    therefore, could not do any further. [987 E-G]
         2. Section	 68 of 1961 Act was introduced for the first
    time in	 the  Act.  There  was	no  provision  in  1922	 Act
    corresponding  to   this   section.   It   gives   statutory
    recognition to the principle that cash credits which are not
    satisfactorily explained  might be  assessed as	 income.  It
    enacts that  if a  sum is  found credited in the books of an
    assessee maintained  for any  previous year, the cash credit
    might, in  case where  it is assessed as undisclosed income,
    be treated  as the  income of  that previous  year, and	 the
    financial year	may not	 be taken  as the  previous year for
    such a	cash credit  even if  the undisclosed income was not
    found to  be from  the assessee's regular business for which
    the books were maintained. The cash credit might be assessed
    either as  business profit  or as income from other sources.

    JUDGMENT:
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 13791380 (NT) of 1974.
From the Judgment and Order dated 31st October, 1973 of the Orissa High Court
in S.J.C. Nos. 85 and 116 of 1972. G S.C. Manchanda, K.C. Dua and Ms. A. &
Subhashini for the Appellants.
S.P. Mittal, S.N. Aggarwal and B.P. Maheshwari for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 982 SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. These
appeals by special leave arise from the decision of the Orissa High Court
dated 31st October, 1973 refusing to direct the Tribunal to state a case under
section 256(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter called the Act)
and to refer certain questions said to be questions of law arising out of the
appellate order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal for determination of the
High Court. The assessment year involved was 1962-63. There were proceedings -
one appeal was related to an assessment order whereby additions were made to
the quantum of income disclosed by the assessee and the other was in respect
of imposition of penalty under section 271(1)(c) read with section 274(2) of
the said Act.
The questions involved respectively in two applications before the High Court
were as follows :
> "S.J.C. No. 116 of 1972
> 1\. Whether In the absence of proving confirmation letters and Hundis by the
> assessee, the assessee has discharged his initial onus by producing merely
> the confirmation letters and Hundis to prove the nature of the transaction?
> 2\. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal was
> right in ordering deletion of Rs. 1,50,000 as assessee's income from
> undisclosed sources?
> 3\. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the cash credit is
> the assessee's income from undisclosed sources?
> S.J.C. No. 85 of 1972.
> Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in
> shifting the onus from the assessee to the Revenue in deleting the penalty?"
The assessee at the relevant time was a private limited company and maintained
accounts according to the calendar 983 year. For the accounting year ending on
31st December, 1961 corresponding to the assessment year 1962-63, the Income-
tax Officer did nor accept the assessee's accounts showing cash credit of Rs.
1,50,000. Three accounts were shown to have been received by way of loans from
three individual creditors of Calcutta under Hundis. The assessee produced
before the Income- tax Officer letters of confirmation, the discharged Hundis
and particulars of the different creditors general index numbers were with the
Income-tax Department. Attempts bad been made to bring those creditors
therefore the Income-tax Officer by issue of notices under Section 131 of the
Act, but the said notices were returned with the endorsement 'left'. The
Income-tax Officer, therefore, treated the entire amount of R. 1,50,000 as
unproved cash credit and added the same to the income of the assessee. The
appeal of the assessee to the Assistant Appellate Commissioner was dismissed.
Thereafter there was further appeal to the Tribunal.
In the meantime on the basis of assessment order proceeding was taken under
section 271(1)(c) of the Act and the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner imposed
a penalty of Rs. 50,000. An appeal against the imposition of penalty was also
filed before the Tribunal. Both the appeals were disposed of by the Tribunal.
The Tribunal noted that the credit entries stood in the name of third parties
in the account books of the assessee. The explanation was that the amounts
represented loans to the assessee from the concerned persons. The assessee had
produced discharged Hundis and confirmation letters from these alleged
lenders. The Tribunal was of the view that if the assessee could not produce
these persons alleged to be the creditors, it did not follow automatically
that the adverse inference should be drawn that these amounts represented
undisclosed income of the assessee. It was further noted that the creditors
were income-tax assessees and while being assessed they had made statements
before the respective Income-tax Officers admitting that they were allowing
their names to be lent without really giving loans as creditors of different
assessee. A list of the assessees had also been given but the name of the
present assessee did not figure in that list. me Tribunal came to the
conclusion that the Revenue was not justified in drawing adverse inference
against the assessee and adding 984 these amounts to the assessment of the
assessee. The Tribunal also, in those circumstances, could not sustain the
imposition of the penalty and deleted such imposition. The Revenue sought for
statement of case on both these aspects i.e. On the aspect of the addition of
Rs. 1,50,000 to the total income of the assessee and also on the imposition of
penalty. The questions sought for by the Revenue were to the effect noted
before. The Tribunal refused to refer any statement of case to the High Court
on those questions. The Revenue went up in an application under section 256(2)
of the Act before the High Court. The High Court also refused to accede to the
prayers of the Revenue. Hence these appeals.
Our attention was drawn to the statements in the assessment order where the
Income-tax Officer had observed certain inconsistencies in the confirmation
letters and observed further that the confirmation letters did not inspire
confidence. It also observed that the assessee had stated that after making
all possible attempts in their own wag, had failed to produce the parties and
thereupon requested the Income-tax Officer to issue summons under section 131
to all the alleged creditors and the notices under section 131 of the Act
which had come back unserved with the remarks 'left'. The assessee thereafter
wanted further opportunity to find out the present whereabouts of the alleged
lenders. The Income-tax Officer observed further that the wide prevalence of
Hundi racket was well-known and it had been established beyond doubt that most
of the so- called Hundiwallas are not genuine bankers but mere name lenders.
It was argued that in view of the provisions of section 68 of the Act, the
onus in these types of cases was on the assessee and in this case the assessee
had not discharged that onus and in the premises questions of law as indicated
above arose. Section 68 of 1961 Act was introduced for the first time in the
Act. There was no provision in 1922 Act corresponding to this section. The
section states that where any sum is found credited in the books of an
assessee maintained for any previous year, and the assessee offers no
explanation about the nature and source thereof or the explanation offered by
him is not, in the opinion of the Income-tax Officer, satisfactory, the sum so
credited may be charged to Income-tax as the income of the assessee of that
previous year. The 985 section only gives statutory recognition to the
principle that cash credits which are not satisfactorily explained might be
assessed as income. The section enacts that if a sum is found credited in the
books of an assessee maintained for any previous year (which might be
different from the financial year), the cash credit might, in case where it is
assessed as undisclosed income, be treated as the income of that previous
year, and the financial year may not be taken as the previous year for such a
cash credit even if the undisclosed income was not found to be from the
assessee's regular business for which the books were maintained. The cash
credit might be assessed either as business profits or as income from other
sources.
Under the 1922 Act where a large amount of cash was found credited on the very
first day of the accounting year, and considering the extent of the business,
it was not possible that the assessee earned a profit of that amount in one
day, the amount could not be assessed as the income of the year from that
business on the first day of which it was credited in the books. Under this
section, even in such a case the unexplained cash credit might be assessed as
the income of the accounting year for which the books are maintained. See in
this connection the observations of Kanga and Palkhiwala's Income Tax, Seventh
Edition, Vol. I pages 609 and 610.
To what extent the assessee has obligation to discharge the burden of proving
that these were genuine incomes has been considered by this Court in Lalchand
Bhagat Ambica Ram v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar and Orissa, 37 ITR 288.
This Court was concerned there with the encashment of high denomination notes.
In that case some unexplained high denomination notes were treated as the
undisclosed income of the assessee. This Court held that when a court of fact
arrives at its decision by considering material which is irrelevant to the
enquiry, or act on material, partly relevant and partly irrelevant, and it is
impossible to say to what extent the mind of the court was affected by the
irrelevant material used by it in arriving at its decision, a question of law
arises, whether the finding of the court is not vitiated by reason of its
having relied upon conjectures, surmises and suspicions not supported by any
evidence on record or partly upon evidence and partly upon inadmissible
material. On no account whatever should the Tribunal base its findings on H
986 suspicions, conjectures or surmises, nor should it act on no evidence at
all or on improper rejection of material and relevant evidence or partly on
evidence and partly on suspicions, conjectures and surmises. In that case the
so- called hundi racket in which the assessee was alleged to have been
involved was not proved. That was only a suspicion of the Revenue.
The question was again considered by this Court in Homi Jehangir Gheesta v.
Commissioner Income-tax, Bombay City, 41 ITR 135, when this Court reiterated
that it was not in all cases that by mere reject on of the explanation of the
assessee, the character of a particular receipt as income could be said to
have been established; but where the circumstances of the rejection were such
that the only proper inference was that the receipt must be treated as income
in the hands of the assessee, there was no reason why the assessing authority
should not draw such an inference. Such an inference was an inference of fact
and not of law. It was further observed that in determining whether an order
of the Appellate Tribunal would give rise to a question of law the court must
read the order of the Tribunal as a whole to determine whether every material
fact, for and against the assessee, had been considered fairly and with due
care; ; whether the evidence pro and con had been considered in reaching the
final conclusion; and whether the conclusion reached by the Tribunal had been
coloured by irrelevant considerations or matters of prejudice. It was further
reiterated that the previous decisions of this Court did not require that the
order of the Tribunal must be examined sentence by sentence through a
microscope as it were, so as to discover a minor lapse here or an incautious
opinion there to be used as a peg on which to hang an issue of law. In
considering probabilities properly arising from the facts alleged or proved,
the Tribunal did not indulge in conjectures, surmises or suspicions.
In Sreelekha Banerjee and others v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar and
Orissa, 49 ITR 112, this Court held that if there was an entry in the account
books of the assessee which showed the receipt of a sum on conversion of high
denomination notes tendered for conversion by the assessee himself. it is
necessary for the assessee to establish, if 987 asked, what the source of that
money was and to prove that it A was not income. The department was not at
that stage required to prove anything. It could ask the assessee to produce
any books of account or other documents or evidence pertinent to the
explanation if one was furnished, and examine the evidence and the
explanation. If the explanation showed that the receipt was not of an income
nature, the department could not act unreasonably and reject that explanation
to hold that it was income. If, however, the evidence was unconvincing then
such rejection could be made. The department cannot by merely rejecting
unreasonably a good explanation, convert good proof into no proof.
In Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta v. Daulatram Rawatmull, 53
ITR 574, the principles governing reference under section 66 of 1922 Act
similar to section 256 of 1961 Act were discussed and it was held that the
High Court has no power under section 66(2) of the Indian Income- tax Act,
1922 which is in pari-materia with section 256(2) of the Act, to call upon the
Appellate Tribunal to state a case if there was some evidence to support the
finding recorded by the Tribunal, even if it appears to the High Court that on
a re-appreciation of the evidence, it might arrive at a conclusion different
from that of the Tribunal.
In this case the assessee had given the names and addresses of the alleged
creditors. It was in the knowledge of the Revenue that the said creditors were
income-tax assessees. Their index number was in the file of the Revenue. The
Revenue, apart from issuing notices under section 131 at the instance of the
assessee, did not pursue the matter further. The Revenue did not examine the
source of income of the said alleged creditors to find out whether they were
credit-worthy or were such who could advance the alleged loans. There was no
effort made to pursue the so called alleged creditors. In those circumstances,
the assessee could not do any further. In the premises, if the Tribunal came
to the conclusion that the assessee had discharged the burden that lay on him
then it could not be said that such a conclusion was unreasonable or perverse
or based on no evidence. If the conclusion is based on some evidence on which
a conclusion could be arrived at, no question of law as such arises.
988
It is common ground that the question on the penalty aspect depended on the
quantum aspect.
In the premises it cannot be said that any question of law arose in these
cases. The High Court was, therefore, right in refusing to refer the questions
sought for. The appeals, therefore, fail and are dismissed with costs.
    P.S.S.				     Appeals dismissed.

to the conclusion that the assessee had discharged the burden that lay on him

    HEADNOTE:
         For the  accounting year  ending on  31st March,  1961,
    corresponding to the assessment year 1962-63, the Income-tax
    Officer did  not accept the assessee's accounts showing cash
    credit of  Rs.1,50,000 said  to have been received by way of
    loans from  three individual  creditors. He  produced before
    the Income-tax	Officer, discharged hundies and confirmation
    letters from these creditors who were income-tax assessees.
    The assessee made attempts to bring the creditors before the
    Income-tax Officer  by issue  of notices  under s.131 of the
    Income-Tax Act, 1961 but failed, as these were returned with
    the  endorsement  'left'.  The	assessee  thereafter  wanted
    further opportunity  to find  out  the	whereabouts  of	 the
    lenders.   The	  Income-tax   Officer	  observed   certain
    inconsistencies in  the confirmation  letters which  did not
    inspire confidence,  and being	of the view that the alleged
    creditors were	not  genuine  bankers  but  were  mere	name
    lenders, treated  the entire  amount as unproved cash credit
    and added  the same  to the  income  of	 the  assessee.	 The
    assistant appellate Commissioner dismissed the appeal of the
    assessee.
         In a  separate proceeding	under a.271(1)(c) of the Act
    on  the	  basis	 of  the  assessment  order  the  Inspecting
creditors. It was in the knowledge of the Revenue that the said creditors were
income-tax assessees. Their index number was in the file of the Revenue. The
