finding recorded in paragraph No.18 of the impugned order with regard to non
compliance of Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is bad in law.
31\. It is to be noted that firstly, it is not in dispute that the address
mentioned in the cause title is the one given by the defendant before the
Trademark Registry. Secondly, the Trial Court on consideration of the entire
material on record has made the ad-interim order absolute. Therefore, the
finding recorded by the  49 Trial Court with regard to non compliance of Order
XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is antithesis of re-affirmative of ad-interim order.
Consequently, it is rendered otiose.
32\. In the light of above discussion, defendant's appeal fails and the cross
objection merits consideration. Resultantly, I pass the following:-
> ORDER

         THESE MFA AND MFA CROB HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
    RESERVED FOR JUDGMENT, THIS DAY, THIS COURT
    PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:-
                          JUDGMENT
This appeal is presented by the defendant before the Trial Court challenging
the order dated 20.2.2016 allowing IAs No.1 & 2 filed under Order XXXIX Rules
1 & 2 read with Section 151 CPC and restraining the defendant from causing any
sale and advertisement of its product under the trademark "cothagiri" or any
other mark either in English or in any other language identified with or
deceptively similar to plaintiff's registered trademarks "Cothas Coffee" and
"Cothas".
2\. Plaintiff-respondent has filed Cross Objections to set aside a finding
recorded by the trial Court that it  4 has not complied with provisions of
Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC.
3\. For the sake of convenience, parties are referred as per their status
before the Trial Court.
4\. Plaintiff, a registered Partnership Firm, brought the instant action by
filing a suit before the Trial Court inter alia praying for:-
• a permanent injunction restraining the defendant and their agents etc., from
infringing plaintiff's trademark "Cothas Coffee" and "Cothas";
• a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from manufacturing or
selling any goods particularly Coffee, Tea or allied products under the
trademark "cothagiri" either in Kannada or any other language, which is
identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademarks "Cothas"
and "Cothas Coffee".
• a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from manufacturing or
selling any goods particularly  5 Coffee, Tea or allied products under the
name "cothagiri" either in Kannada or any other language, which is identical
with or deceptively similar to plaintiff's trademarks "Cothas" and "Cothas
Coffee".
5\. Plaintiffs also filed an I.A. under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC praying
for an order of temporary injunction and the Trial Court granted an ex-parte
ad-
interim order of injunction on 30.4.2015. Later, by impugned order dated
20.2.2016, Trial Court rejected an I.A. filed by the defendant to vacate the
ad-interim order but made it absolute.
6\. Heard Sri Aditya Sondhi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant and Sri
S. Sreevatsa, learned Senior Counsel for the caveator/respondent.
7\. Sri Aditya Sondhi, learned Senior Counsel made following submissions in
support of this appeal:-
(a) Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 ('Act' for short) defines
infringement. A registered Trade Mark  6 is said to be infringed by a person,
if he uses the same in the course of a trade, which is identical with or
deceptively similar to a registered trademark in relation to goods or
services.
Amplifying his submission, he contended that only two contingencies are
envisaged, which would result in infringement. The first one is direct use of
a registered trademark and the second is use of a mark which is identical or
deceptively similar. He submitted that neither contingency has occurred in the
instant case. To buttress his contention, he produced the packing material
used by both plaintiff and defendant to pack and sell coffee powder.
Adverting to the defendant's packing material, he submitted that the packaging
cover is distinct in its identity. The words 'cotha' and 'giri' are written in
an artistic manner with a background of 'hills' in Yellow and Brown colour
combination. Adverting to the packing cover used by the plaintiff, he
submitted that the said cover has no colour combination and  7 the words
"Cothas Coffee" is written both in English and Kannada languages. He argued
that by no stretch of imagination, a reasonable person can infer that both
products are one and the same and therefore there is no infringement as
defined under Section 29 of the Act.
(b) That the ex-parte ad-interim order passed by the Trial Court was also
nonest in law because the respondent did not comply with the mandatory
provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC. In support of this contention, he placed
reliance on the following passage from the Judgment of Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi in the case of AGI Logistics INC and Anr. v. Mr.Sher Jang Bhadhur and
Anr. delivered in C.S.(OS) 1314/2009, which reads as under:-
> "10. It is plain that the plaintiffs, after obtaining an ex parte ad interim
> injunction against the Defendants, failed to deliver to the
> Applicants/Defendants or to send them by registered post within one week, a
> copy of the application for ad interim injunction  8 together with (i) a
> copy of the affidavit filed in support of the application (ii) a copy of the
> plaint and (iii) copies of the documents on which the plaintiffs rely upon.
> The statutory requirement is unambiguous.
Every document filed by the plaintiffs themselves, on the basis of which they
obtained an ad interim ex parte injunction, has to necessarily be "delivered"
to the Defendant. The word deliver would necessarily mean actual physical
delivery on the Defendant. The only alternative mode that the provision
envisages is dispatch by registered post, immediately after the order granting
injunction has been made. The dispatch by registered post as again would be of
the entire set of documents as set out under Clause (a) to the proviso to
Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC. There can be no escape from complying with this
provisions".
He also adverted to the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Shiv Kumar Chadha v.
MCD MANU/SC/0522/1993 : (1993)3 SCC 161, and  9 argued that non compliance of
Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC renders an ex-parte interim order nonest.
(c) That the Trial Court erred in making a 'side by side' comparison of the
Trade Marks. In support of this contention, he placed reliance on the
following passage of the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. and Co., Mysore reported in (1972) 1 SCC 618,
which reads as under:-
> "9. It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether
> one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential feature
> of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to
> find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they
> are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the
> other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall
> similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person
> usually dealing with one, to accept the other if ffered to him. In this case
> we find that the packets are  10 practically of the same size, the colour
> scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not
> identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for
> the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with one
> arm raised and carrying something in the other with a cow or cows near her
> and hens or chickens in the foreground. In the background there is a farm
> house with a fence..............."
(d) That the defendant is protected under Section 35 of the Act. It has coined
and chosen 'cothagiri' as its trade name for its product because 'cotha' is
the family name of directors' respective spouses. Under Section 35 of the Act,
a registered user of a trademark shall not be entitled to interfere with any
bonafide use by a person of his own name or that of his place of business or
of his predecessor. Further, 'giri' means mountains, where coffee is grown.
Thus, defendant is protected under Section 35 of the Act against any action.
In support of this contention, he  11 placed reliance on following passage
from the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Precious Jewels
and another v. Varun Gems reported in (2015) 1 SCC 160, which reads as under:-
> "9. As stated hereinabove, Section 35 of the Act permits anyone to do his
> business in his own name in a bona fide manner. In the instant case, it is
> not in dispute that the Defendants are doing their business in their own
> name and their bona fides have not been disputed. It is also not in dispute
> that the Plaintiff and Defendants are related to each other and practically
> all the family members are in the business of jewellery..............."
He also referred to paragraph-11 from the judgement in the case of Sterling's
Mac Fast Food v. McDonald's Corporation, U.S.A. & Anr. reported in 2005 (30)
PTC 417 (Karn) which reads as under:-
> "11. The defendant has contended that the business was started mainly by  12
> Mr.John Mathew, who was running the Sterling Group in Dubai and Doha. When
> he decided to open a branch in India, he decided to name the same after his
> son, Mac Mathew, hence the name Sterling Mac Fast Food. Mr.Mac Mathew was
> born in 1973 and that after the retirement of its partner, Mr.Aboobaker, Mac
> Mathew has been inducted into the partnership. The choice of the name Mac
> having arisen from the name of Mac Mathew was bond fide and no mala fides
> can be attached to the same, since it is the name of one of the partner of
> the defendant".
(e) That the plaintiff markets its products in the name of 'Cothas Coffee'.
The words 'cothagiri' and 'Cothas Coffee' cannot be slurred over in
pronunciation as they are distinctly dis-similar. In support of this
submission, he placed reliance on paragraph - 8 of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of F.Hoffmann-LA Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner
& Co. Pvt. Ltd. reported in 1969(2) SCC 716, which reads as follows:-
13
"8. In order to decide whether the word "Dropovit" is deceptively similar to
the word "Protovit" each of the two words must, therefore, be taken as a whole
word. Each of the two words consists of eight letters, the last three letters
are common, and in the uncommon part the first two are consonants, the next is
the same vowel 'O', the next is a consonant and the fifth is again a common
vowel 'O'. The combined effect is to produce an alliteration. The affidavits
of the appellant indicate that last three letters "Vit" is a well known common
abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical trade to denote Vitamin preparations.
In his affidavit, dated January 11, 1961 Frank Murdoch, has referred to the
existence on the Register of about 57 trade marks which have the common suffix
"Vit" indicating that the goods are vitamin preparations. It is apparent that
the terminal syllable "Vit" in the two marks is both descriptive and common to
the trade. If greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two  14
words, it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with
the other. The letters 'D' and 'P' in "Dropovit" and the corresponding letters
'P' and 'T' in "Protovit" cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and
the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of
confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view".
(f) That the plaintiff has attempted to question defendant's ethical
correctness in incorporating its Company and to market Coffee whilst
respective spouses of both Directors of the Company namely, Girija Chandan and
Satyavati Prakas had received large sums of money at the time of dissolution
of the firm 'Cothas Coffee Co' on 23.12.2013. He argued that the appellant is
a Private Limited Company and a juristic person. It is separate and distinct
from its members. Its rights and obligations are different from those of its
shareholders. In support of this contention, he placed reliance on a portion
of  15 paragraph No.4 from the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union v. State of Bihar and others reported
in 1969 (1) SCC 765, which reads as under:-
> "4...............An incorporated company, as is well known, has a separate
> existence and the law recognizes it as a juristic person separate and
> distinct form its members. This new personality emerges from the moment of
> its incorporation and from that date the person subscribing to its
> memorandum of association and others joining it as members are regarded as a
> body incorporate or a corporation aggregate and the new person begins to
> function as an entity. (Cf. Salomon v.
> Salomon & Co.). Its rights and obligations are different from those of its
> shareholders. Action taken against it does not directly affect its
> shareholders..........."
(g) That the Plaintiff has also found fault with the Directors of defendant
Company for not having  16 mentioning names of their respective husbands in
the memorandum of association of the Company.
Shri. Sondhi submitted that there is absolutely no mala fide intention in not
disclosing the names of their respective husbands. On the other hand, father's
name has been mentioned in compliance with the statutory requirements under
the Companies Act, 1956.
8\. In sum and substance, he argued that defendant being a Company
incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, has an independent entity of it's
own. The trade names 'cothagiri' and 'Cothas Coffee' are not deceptively
similar. The word 'cotha' is the family name of the respective spouses of
Directors of the Company. Therefore, firstly there is no infringement of the
Trade Mark as defined under Section 29 of the Act.
Secondly, the use of name 'cothagiri' is protected from any action under
Section 35 of the Act. Therefore, Trial Court  17 fell in an error while
granting the ex-parte ad-interim order of injunction and further erred in
making it absolute.
With the above submissions, he prayed for setting aside the impugned order by
allowing this appeal.
9\. Per contra, Sri S. Sreevatsa, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent supporting the impugned order, made following submissions:-
(a) Defendant is selling coffee under the trade name 'cotha giri' which is
deceptively similar to 'Cothas Coffee' and it amounts to infringement of
trademark as defined under Section 29 of the Act.
(b) Defendant- Company is promoted by Mrs. Girija Chandan wife of C.P. Chandan
and Mrs. Satyavati Prakas wife of Cothas K. Prakas. Respective husbands of
both directors are the retiring partners and signatories to the 'Deed of
Retirement' dated 23.12.2013 of the Partnership Firm "Cothas Coffee Co." under
the said Deed, Cothas K. Prakas has received a sum of Rs.11,74,25,000/- and
C.P.
18
Chandan has received Rs.59,90,000/- in full and final settlement of their
claims. The retiring partners have covenanted not to engage in any activity
similar to the one carried further by the plaintiff either directly or
indirectly for a period of three years.
However, in violation of the said covenant, Defendant-Company was incorporated
on 25.7.2014. Therefore, it shall not be entitled for any protection under
Section 35 of the Act;
(c) In the application filed before the trade marks authorities, defendant has
shown it's address as No:
514/1, 80 feet Road, I Block, Koramangala, Bengaluru-560 034. Therefore,
plaintiff has mentioned the same address in the plaint.
Defendant has not denied that the address given in the cause title is
incorrect in it's written statement.
Hence, the defendant's any grievance with regard to non compliance of Rule
3(a) of Order XXXIX CPC is untenable in law.
19
(d) The words 'cotha' and 'giri' are written in two different lines in the
packaging covers used by the defendant. 'Cotha' is written in the first line
and 'giri' in the second line. This is deceptively similar to the manner in
which plaintiff has written 'Cothas' in the first line and 'coffee' in the
second line.
Therefore, coffee powder marketed by the defendant can be easily passed off as
'Cothas Coffee'.
10\. In support of above contentions, learned Senior Counsel for plaintiff
placed reliance on the following judgments reported in:-
> (i) (2002) 2 SCC 147 (Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills Limited v. Mahindra &
> Mahindra Ltd.), paragraphs No. 16, 17, 18, 23 & 24\. Relevant portions are
> extracted hereunder:-
> "16...............On analysis of the principles laid down in the decisions,
> certain recognized parameters relating to the matter have emerged. Without
> intending to be exhaustive some of the principles which are accepted as well
> settled may be stated thus: that whether  20 there is a likelihood of
> deception or confusion arising is a matter for decision by the court, and no
> witness is entitled to say whether the mark is likely to deceive or to cause
> confusion; that all factors which are likely to create or allay deception or
> confusion must be considered in combination; that broadly speaking, factors
> creating confusion would be, for example, the nature of the market itself,
> the class of customers, the extent of the reputation, the trade channels,
> the existence of any connection in course of trade, and others.
17\. This Court, in the case of Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food
Products Ltd. Observed that: (SCR pp.978-99) "The question whether two
competing marks are so similar as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion
is one of first impression and it is for the court to decide it. The question
has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average  21
intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural
and phonetic similarity of the two marks Gluvita and Glucovita is likely to
deceive or to cause confusion. In deciding whether two marks are so similar as
to be likely to deceive or cause confusion the similarity of idea is a
relevant consideration."
24\. Judging the case in hand on the touchstone of the principles laid down in
the aforementioned decided cases, it is clear that the plaintiff has been
using the words "Mahindra" and "Mahindra & Mahindra" in its companies/business
concerns for a long span of time extending over five decades. The name has
acquired a distinctiveness and a secondary meaning in the business or trade
circles. People have come to associate the name "Mahindra" with a certain
standard of goods and services. Any attempt by another person to use the name
in business and trade circles is likely to and in probability will create an
impression of a connection with the plaintiffs' Group of Companies. Such user
may also affect the plaintiff prejudicially  22 in its business and trading
activities. Undoubtedly, the question whether the plaintiff's claim of
"passing-off action" against the defendant will be accepted or not has to be
decided by the Court after evidence is led in the suit. Even so for the
limited purpose of considering the prayer for interlocutory injunction which
is intended for maintenance of status quo, the trial court rightly held that
the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and irreparable prejudice it
its favour which calls for passing an order of interim injunction restraining
the defendant Company which is yet to commence its business from utitlising
the name of "Mahendra" or "Mahendra & Mahendra" for the purpose of its trade
and business. Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court cannot be
faulted for confirming the order of injunction passed by the learned Single
Judge."
(ii) 2004 (76) DRJ 616 in the case of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd v. Reddy
Pharmaceuticals Limited, (paragraphs No.10 and 11) which read as under:-
> "10. Coming to the question as to whether the plaintiff has succeeded or not
> in establishing a prima facie case in its favour for grant of ad interim
> injunction,  23 this Court finds that the pleadings of the parties as well
> as documents placed on record prima facie show that since 1984 or so the
> plaintiff company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of bulk drugs as
> well as finished pharmaceutical preparations.
The plaintiff has huge sales of its products not only in India but in other
countries also. Its turn over is about 68 crores or so in regard to branded
formulations. Its exports also were to the tune of Rs.115 crores in the year
2002-2003. it has established its subsidiaries in many countries which are
also using its trade name/ trade mark "Dr. Reddy", the logo representing a man
with outstretched arms and word mark "Dr. Reddy's" which was created in April,
2001 is an original artistic work within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the
Copyright Act. In December, 2002 it was formally assigned to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff has applied for the registration of the said logo as well as
trade mark in various countries including India. The registration process in
Romania is already complete. It is, therefore, prima facie shown on record
that the plaintiff is a leading manufacturer of  24 bulk drugs as well as
pharmaceutical preparations and its trade mark "Dr. Reddy's" and a logo
comprised of a man with outstretched arms has acquired substantial recognition
not only in India but abroad also. The drugs and pharmaceutical preparations
manufactured by the plaintiff have earned enormous trade reputation and
goodwill and plaintiff is distinctively identified and associated with trade
mark/name "Dr. Reddy" as well as logo.
11\. The pleadings and the material on record prima facie show that the
defendant also has been functioning under the trade name "Reddy Pharmaceutical
Limited" since 1996 but its sphere of business was never manufacturing drugs
or pharmaceutical preparations. It is shown on the record that the defendant
was only a trader in bulk drugs and was acting as an agent of the plaintiff
even for the sale of bulk drugs. The defendant was purchasing bulk drugs since
1997 not only from the plaintiff but from other manufacturers also and was
supplying the same to various pharmaceutical companies and as such  25 was an
agent only for the sale of bulk drugs. The copies of invoices placed on record
prima facie establish this fact. The defendant was appointed a Delcredere
Agent by plaintiff on 1.4.2003 and an agreement was entered between them in
this behalf. Till April, 2003, therefore, there was no problem between the
plaintiff and defendant but in August, 2003 the defendant suddenly launched
about 33 pharmaceutical preparations under various brand names and started
using the name "Reddy" which gave the plaintiff a rude jolt in as much as in
the field of manufacturing of bulk drugs and pharmaceutical preparations the
trade mark "Dr.Reddy's" was distinctly associated and identified with the
plaintiff company. There is nothing on record to show that prior to August,
2003 the defendant was engaged in the manufacturing or sale of the
pharmaceutical preparations under the trade name "Reddy". The Articles of
Association of the defendant which say that one of the objects of the
defendant company was to carry on business of manufacture and trading of all
kinds of  26 pharmaceutical preparations and drugs does not advance the
defendant's case in any manner as it is shown on record that prior to August,
2003 the defendant was not at all engaged in the manufacturing, marketing or
sale of pharmaceutical preparations. It was only dealing in bulk drugs
manufactured by others including the plaintiff company".
(iii) 1987 SCC Bom 225 : AIR 1988 BOM 167 (Bajaj Electricals Limited, Bombay
v. Metals & Allied Products, Bombay and another),:-
"7. It is required to be stated at the out set that in the present case the
question for determination is whether the defendants are guilty of passing off
and not of infringement of trade mark. It was contended by Mr. Cooper, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, that the surname of the
partners of defendant No.1 being 'Bajaj', the defendants are entitled to use
their own name and unless it is established that the user was dishonest, it is
not permissible to grant injunction on the ground that the user is likely to
cause deception or confusion in the mind of the customers. It is not possible
to accept the submission of the learned  27 counsel. It is necessary to bear
in mind that the defendant No.1 is not using the word "Bajaj" as a trading
style, but are only using the word "Bajaj" as a trade mark or a sign and such
user is not permissible. It is required to be stated at this juncture that Mr.
Cooper did not dispute that the plaintiffs have acquired large reputation by
user of the word "Bajaj" in respect of sale of their goods, but contended that
the surname of the partners of the defendants being "Bajaj", there is no
objection for the defendants' using the word by that trade sign. The reliance
in this connection by Mr. Tulzapurkar on the decision of House of Lords in the
case of Parker - Knoll Limited v. Knoll International Limited reported in 1962
R.P.C.265 is very appropriate. Lord Morris, while opening the speech, observed
:
"In the interests of fair trading and in the interests of all who may wish to
buy or to sell goods the law recognises that certain limitations upon freedom
of action are necessary and desirable. In some situations the law has had to
resolve what might at first appear to be conflicts between competing right. In
solving the problems which have arisen there has been no need to resort to any
abstruse principles but rather, I think, to the straightforward principle that
trading must not  28 only be honest but must not even unintentionally be
unfair."
It was further observed :
"A name may be used as a mark under which a person's goods are sold so that
the name comes to denote goods made by that person and not the goods made by
anyone else or even made by anyone else who has the same name. So also a mark
under which a person's goods are sold may come to denote goods made by that
person. The name or the mark will have acquired a secondary meaning."
The sequitur of this finding was that someone may, even by using his own name
and using it innocently, make a representation that is untrue, that is a
representation that goods which in fact are his are the goods of someone else.
Lord Morris thereafter referred to the celebrated passage from the judgment of
Justice Romer in the case of Joseph Rodgers & Sons, Limited v. W. N. Rodgers &
Company reported in (1924) 41 R. P. C. 277. The passage at p. 291 reads as
under : -
"It is the law of this land that no man is entitled to carry on his business
in such a way as to represent that it is the business of another, or is in any
way connected with the business of  29 another; that is the first proposition.
The second proposition is that no man is entitled so to describe or mark his
goods as to represent that the goods are the goods of another. To the first
proposition there is, I myself think an exception: a man, in my opinion, is
entitled to carry on his business in his own name so long as he does not do
anything more than to cause confusion with the business of another, and so
long as he does it honestly. To the second rule, to which I have referred, I
think there is no exception at all; that is that a man is not entitled so to
describe his goods as to lead to the belief that they are the goods of
somebody else."
The House of Lords then noted the distinction drawn by Justice Romer between
trading under a name and passing off of goods by the use of a name. The
distinction noticed by Justice Romer was subsequently accepted as correct by
Viscount Simonds and in several other decisions. Relying on this decision, Mr.
Tulzapurkar urged, and in our judgment with considerable merit, that the
defendants are not carrying on their trade in the name of "Bajaj", but are
using the mark as a trading sign and that is not permissible. Mr. Cooper
controverted the submission by relying upon the dissent voiced by Lord Denning
and Lord Devlin in their speeches. It is undoubtedly true that these  30
judges were not inclined to accept the distinction noticed by Mr. Justice
Romer, but even then have clearly stated that if the use by the defendants of
their own name was likely to deceive, then there would have been no defence to
the action of passing off, no matter how honest and bona fide the user was.
The decision of the majority of the House of Lords is good law in England for
last over 25 years and no case has been brought to our attention where the
accuracy of the principles laid down has been doubted. We see no reason at
this interim stage to accept the submission of Mr. Cooper that the minority
view should be preferred to that of the majority and the distinction noticed
by the House of Lords should be ignored. Mr. Cooper invited our attention to a
decision in the case of Turton v. Turton reported in (1889) 42 Ch. D 128, and
to the decision in the case of S. Chivers & Sons v. S. Chivers & Co. Ltd.
reported in (1900) 17 R.P.C. 420. The decision in the case of Turton was
considered by the House of Lords in the case of Parker-Knoll Limited, and the
observations in case of Chivers were based on peculiar facts of that case,
and, in our judgment, it is not possible to by- pass the decision of the House
of Lords by reference to these cases."

(iv) 2007(35) PTC 548 (Karn) [Adiga's Abhiruchi and Ors. v. Adiga's Fast
Food], (paragraphs No.12 and 13) which read as follows:-
"12. The next question that requires consideration is with regard to the
contention putforth by the Defendant that since the said business is a
business of the community to which the Defendant belong and since the
community has the common as ADIGA, the same cannot be prevented more
particularly in view of the provisions contained in Section 35 of the Act. At
the outset with regard to the common name being shared by the members of the
community, the said issue came up for consideration in the case of D.R.Reddy
and in the case of Bajaj Electricals Ltd. cited supra. In the first case, the
Delhi High Court has held, the contention that such a name had been adapted
since the name of the Managing Director of the Defendant/Company was Mr.Reddy
cannot be accepted since the same would lead to confusion and deception and
therefore the Defendant was restrained form adapting the trade name REDDY.
Further in the case of Bajaj Electricals also, the High Court of Bombay was of
the view that the contention of the defendant that the Surname of the
Defendant being Bajaj, the Defendants are entitled to use their own name is to
be  32 rejected. That being so, the contention of the Defendnat that the name
AIDGA being the community name, the same could be used and therefore N.K.ADIGA
has been used cannot be accepted since the same would infringe the trade mark
of the Plaintiff. Further with regard to the contention that Section 35 of the
Act would not entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered
trade name to interfere with any bona fide use by a person of his own name or
that of his place or business would not come to the assistance of the
Defendant not only in view of the above stated decisions but the question in
the present case would be as to whether the use of N.K. ADIGA ABHIRUCHI has
been done in a bona fide manner. In this regard, the Photographs produced
before the Court below would indicate that at the first instance the Defendant
had notified by displaying the banner as ADIGA'S ABHIRUCHI would be opening
shortly. The said name is a direct infringement of the trade name of the
Plaintiff which is a registered one. It is only after legal notice was issued
by the Plaintiff, the Defendant had changed the name as N.K.AGIGA ABHIRUCHI
and that too N.K. has been displayed insignificantly, which would clearly
indicate that it has been changed only to pre-empt and overcome the protest of
the Plaintiff. As such the Plaintiff cannot take  33 shelter under the said
provision. Even otherwise the Act provides for rectification and correction of
the register vide chapter VII of the Act and as such if the Defendant is
aggrieved by the registration of the trade mark by registering the name of the
community, it would be open to the Defendant to take recourse to the remedy
contemplated therein and cannot make use of the provision for infringing a
trade mark which is registered.
13\. Having considered these aspects of the matter and having come to the
conclusion that there is a triable issue and a prima facie case has been made
out by the Plaintiff with regard to infringement of the trade mark of the
Plaintiff the next question that would arise is as to whether in the present
facts and circumstances of the case, the tripod test should be followed by the
Court below before granting the injunction. It is in this regard both the
learned Counsel have relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of
M/s. S.M.K.A. Enterprises v. M/s. Suchita Industries MFA 4424/07 to contend
that from the view point of the Plaintiff nothing more is required to be
considered and from the view point of the Defendant that other two issues
relating to balance of convenience and irreparable loss also would have to be
considered by the Court  34 below which has not been done in the present case.
A careful perusal of the cited order passed by this Court has provided
instances wherein the said test is required to be followed and in cases where
it is not required. This Court had come to the conclusion that when the case
putforth by the Plaintiff is of infringement of a deceptively similar trade
mark keeping in view the success rate of the Plaintiff, the other questions
also require consideration. While adverting on the matter further this Court
had taken certain instances with regard to the nature in which such
consideration is required and after considering the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. v. Sudhir
Bhatia MANU/SC/0186/2004 : (2004) 3 SCC 90 in the Laxman Rekha and Magic
Laxman Rekha had come to the conclusion that insofar as certain services
provided if the trade name infringes another trade name even with a prefix or
a suffix, the same would amount to infringement and no other consideration is
required since the protection provided under the Act by way of injunction in
rem would only get formalized by way of injunction in personam. It is with
regard to certain packaing products this Court was of the view that a further
consideration may be necessary in the facts of each case if the original name
and deceptively similar name  35 appear phonetically or visually similar. If
this decision is kept in view to consider the present facts and circumstances
of the case, both the Plaintiff as well as the Defendants are in the business
of catering and preparing vegetarian food articles and as such if the
Defendant runs such another outlet indicating the very same name of the
Plaintiff merely by prefixing or suffixing certain other name which is similar
to the trade mark of the Plaintiff, the question of balance of convenience and
irreparable loss would not arise since a common customer would believe that
the same is a sister concern or another outlet of the original outlet viz.,
one being run by the Plaintiff."
11\. In sum and substance, the learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff
submitted that this is a case in which the family members, who were partners
of Cothas Coffee Co, immediately after their retirement from the Partnership
have incorporated defendant Company on 25.7.2014 through their spouses and
committed infringement of Trade Mark and also passed off their goods as
manufactured by the plaintiff. Accordingly, he  36 prayed for dismissal of
this appeal and to allow cross objections.
12\. I have given my careful consideration to the submissions made by learned
Senior Counsel for both the parties and perused material papers.
13\. The Trial Court has framed following points for its consideration:-
> (1) Whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for continuation
> of ad- interim temporary injunction granted on IA.1 on 30.4.2015 and
> extended from time to time?
> (2) Whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of
> temporary injunction as prayed in IA.2?
> (3) In whose favour balance of convenience lies?
> (4) Whether the defendant has made out a ground to vacate the order of ad-
> interim injunction as prayed in IA.3?
37
> (5) Whether the plaintiff will be put to irreparable loss and hardship if an
> order of an-interim injunction is vacated and not continued and granted as
> prayed in IA.1 & 2?
Answering Point No.1 partly in affirmative, Point No.2 in the affirmative,
Point No.3 in favour of plaintiff, Point No.4 in the negative and Point No.5
in the affirmative, the Trial Court has allowed IAs No.I and II under Order
XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC and rejected IA No.III filed under Order XXXIX Rule 4
CPC.
14\. In the premise, based on the pleadings and submissions of the learned
Senior Counsel for the parties, the following points arise for consideration
of this Court:-
(i) Whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case entitling itself for
a temporary injunction pending disposal of the suit?
(ii) Whether the impugned order requires any interference?
38
15\. Re.Point No.(i):
Gravamen of plaintiff's case is that the defendant -
Company is incorporated by two ladies, who were admittedly respective spouses
of former partners of 'Cothas Coffee Co.' This appeal is against an order
granting interim protection pending trial. Therefore, what needs to be
examined at this stage is whether the plaintiff has made out prima facie case
to entitle itself for interim protection.
16\. It is indisputable that Directors of the defendant - Company are none
other than respective spouses of retiring Partners of the family business firm
run in the name and style of "Cothas Coffee Co". The Deed of Retirement is
executed on 23.12.2013. There was an embargo placed against the retiring
partners from engaging in any activities similar to the one carried on by the
said firm for a period of three years. Defendant-
Company is admittedly incorporated on 25.7.2014 which  39 is about 8 months
from the date of execution of deed of retirement.
17\. Plaintiff firm, 'Cothas Coffee Co.' is continued by two other partners
namely, C.K. Sreenathan and his son C.S. Nitin. The recitals contained in the
deed disclose that the partnership firm was carrying on the business of
manufacture and sale of Coffee Seeds, Coffee Powder, Blended Coffee Powder,
Chicory and allied products. The retiring partners, Cothas K. Prakas and C.P.
Chandan were paid Rs.11,74,25,000/- and Rs.59,90,000/-
respectively in full and final settlement of their respective claims, which
included all claims against immovable and movable properties, leasehold
rights, possessory rights, receivables, claims, credits, goodwill, trade mark,
patents and product names etc. The continuing partners were exclusively
entitled to immovable and movable properties of the Partnership Firm including
lease hold rights, possessory rights, receivables, claims, credits, goodwill,
trade mark, patents, product names and all profits and  40 benefits flowing
there from. They were also solely responsible for the past and future
liabilities and losses, if any.
18\. Clause 14 of the Retirement Deed reads as follows:-
> "14. The Retiring Partners shall not engage, for a period of 3 years from
> the Retirement Date, in any activity which is similar to the activities
> carried on by the Partnership as on this date, either directly or indirectly
> in any capacity including as a Proprietor, Partner, Share Holder, Director,
> Managing Director, employee, consultant or agent. However this restriction
> is not applicable to the manufacture and sale of Roasted Coffee Seed/beans,
> which forms part of the Business of the Partnership thereby the Retiring
> Partners are free to engage themselves in any capacity in the business of
> manufacture and sale of Roasted Coffee Seeds/beans."
> (emphasis supplied)  41
> 19\. Infringement of trade mark, violation of copyright and misuse of any
> intellectual property fall under the same species. Statutes governing trade
> mark, copyright etc., have been enacted to protect its owners and actual
> users. An individual or group of persons or a company strive hard for
> several years and perhaps even decades in inventing or developing a product
> or building a reputation in the market by selling its product under a
> particular brand name which shall have a distinct characteristic by which it
> is identified. By sustained endeavour and hard work, the inventor or
> developer of a product establishes his reputation and earns goodwill in the
> market. Co-employees, agnates or cognates in a family business, employees in
> a corporate sector or laboratories may be tempted to branch out and to
> establish their own entities independently. Sometimes, even a stranger while
> setting up his own business may attempt to copy a product developed or
> marketed by an established or reputed company and use it as a spring board
> to make quick returns. All such actions, which  42 surface either within the
> family or organization or by a stranger will have an adverse impact on the
> market share of an established and reputed business entity.
'Infringement' and 'passing off' are two major maladies and constant threats
to well established business entities.
20\. It was strenuously argued by Sri Aditya Sondhi to make out a point that
defendant is a private limited company and it is an independent entity by
itself.
He sought to seek protection under Section 35 of the Act by contending the
word 'Cotha' & 'Giri' form a combination of two words by using the family name
'Cotha' and a portion of the name of one of the Directors 'Girija Chandan'. It
was further contended that the word 'Giri' also means a 'mountain'/'hill',
where Coffee is grown. His next endeavour was to postulate that the words
'Cothas Coffee' and 'Cothagiri' cannot be slurred over in pronunciation as
they are distinctly dis-similar.
43
21\. Whatever be the explanation and justification on behalf of the defendant,
it is indelible on record that prior to 25.7.2014 defendant-company was not in
existence. On facts, it is not in dispute that the plaintiff has been
producing and marketing its product as 'Cothas Coffee' for several years. The
defendant-Company is floated by the two ladies, whose respective spouses are
retired partners of 'Cothas Coffee Co.' The retiring partners have covenanted
not to indulge in a business similar to the 'Cothas Coffee Co.' either
'directly' or 'indirectly'. They have expressly given up the trade mark.
In these circumstances, they cannot be heard to contend that defendant is an
independent entity created under the Companies Act and enjoys an independent
right to indulge in business similar to that of plaintiff oblivious of the
covenants executed by the retiring partners of plaintiff-
firm.
22\. Further, the packaging material is designed in similar and deceptive
manner, wherein the word 'Cotha' or  44 'Cothas' alone is found in the first
line in both packages.
Thus, a critical analysis of the facts of this case leads to an irresistible
inference that the retiring partners of 'Cothas Coffee Co.' have made an
attempt to circumvent clause 14 of the Retirement Deed, which placed an
embargo on them from indulging in similar activities through defendant -
Company promoted by their respective spouses.
23\. This appeal is against an order of temporary injunction passed on an I.A.
filed under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC. The Trial Court has recorded
following findings while passing the impugned order.
♦ that the Directors of defendant - Company are family members of ex -
partners of plaintiff - firm. They were acquainted with the trademark 'Cothas
Coffee'.
♦ Examination of trademarks 'Cothas Coffee' and 'Cotha giri' shows that both
are phonetically and visually similar.
45
24\. Having perused the pleadings and re-
examining the material on record, it is reasonable to presume that the
defendants did have full knowledge of the trademark of plaintiff and its
reputation in the market and yet, attempted to sell their product with similar
name and style.
25\. Further, it is settled that a Court of appeal should be slow in
interfering with the discretionary orders passed by the Trial Court, even if,
a contrary view is possible by an appellate Court. On this point, I may
respectfully recall the following passage from the judgment in the case of
Wander Ltd. and another v. Antox India P.
Ltd. reported in 1990 (Supp) SCC 727:
> "14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of
> discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the appellate court will
> not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance
> and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown
> to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely  46 or
> where the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant
> or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of
> discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. The appellate court will
> not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the
> one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court was
> reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not
> be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal
> solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage
> it would have come to a contrary conclusion.
(emphasis supplied)
26\. In view of above discussion, it can be unhesitatingly held that the
plaintiff have made out a prima facie case and preeminently deserved interim
protection by way of temporary injunction pending trial.
Hence point No: 1 is answered in favour of plaintiff.
47
27\. Re-Point No.2:
Answer to point No: 1 being in the affirmative, the impugned order does not
require any interference except with a finding on compliance of Order XXXIX
Rule 3 CPC which is subject matter of cross objection.
28\. Re-MFA.CROB.64/2016:
Plaintiff has filed this cross objection with a prayer to set aside a finding
recorded by the Trial Court that the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC
were not complied by the plaintiff.
29\. Temporary injunction was granted on 30.4.2015. Plaintiff took steps to
comply with the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC. The postal cover was
returned unserved.
30\. It was argued by Sri. Sreevatsa, learned Senior Counsel for plaintiff
that cover was sent to the address obtained from Trademark Registry where the
48 defendant has given its address as No.514/1, 80 feet road, I Block,
Koramangala, Bangalore - 560 034.
Therefore, plaintiff, unsuspectingly believed that the said address is correct
and mentioned the same in the cause - title. It was further argued that the
defendant did not raise any objections with regard to the address in the
written statement. Learned Senior Counsel further argued that the Trial Court
by the impugned order has made the ad-interim order absolute. Hence, the
finding recorded in paragraph No.18 of the impugned order with regard to non
compliance of Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is bad in law.
31\. It is to be noted that firstly, it is not in dispute that the address
mentioned in the cause title is the one given by the defendant before the
Trademark Registry. Secondly, the Trial Court on consideration of the entire
material on record has made the ad-interim order absolute. Therefore, the
finding recorded by the  49 Trial Court with regard to non compliance of Order
XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is antithesis of re-affirmative of ad-interim order.
Consequently, it is rendered otiose.
32\. In the light of above discussion, defendant's appeal fails and the cross
objection merits consideration. Resultantly, I pass the following:-
> ORDER
> (i) MFA.No.2170/2016 is dismissed;
> (ii) MFA.CROB.No.64/2016 is allowed;
> and the finding recorded by the Trial Court in paragraph No.18 that 'it is
> well founded that the plaintiff has (sic) not taken care to comply the
> provisions of order 39 rule 3(a) CPC.' is set aside.
> No costs.

    AND 323 PART B, JIGANI

finding recorded in paragraph No.18 of the impugned order with regard to non
compliance of Order XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is bad in law.
31\. It is to be noted that firstly, it is not in dispute that the address
mentioned in the cause title is the one given by the defendant before the
Trademark Registry. Secondly, the Trial Court on consideration of the entire
material on record has made the ad-interim order absolute. Therefore, the
finding recorded by the  49 Trial Court with regard to non compliance of Order
XXXIX Rule 3(a) CPC is antithesis of re-affirmative of ad-interim order.
Consequently, it is rendered otiose.
32\. In the light of above discussion, defendant's appeal fails and the cross
objection merits consideration. Resultantly, I pass the following:-
> ORDER
> (i) MFA.No.2170/2016 is dismissed;
> (ii) MFA.CROB.No.64/2016 is allowed;
> and the finding recorded by the Trial Court in paragraph No.18 that 'it is
