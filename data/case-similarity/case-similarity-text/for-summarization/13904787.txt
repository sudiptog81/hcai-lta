and imposition of penalty.
2\. Ld. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the demand has been made of
reverse charge basis in respect of technical know-how obtained by the
appellant form their foreign principal. Ld .Counsel pointed out that Revenue
has not shown if the said technical know-
how is registered or patented in India. He argued that in absence of the said
evidence demand cannot be confirmed as is been held in the case of Sicpa India
Pvt. Ltd. vs CCE & ST Siliguri 2018 (15) GSTL 375

3\. Ld. AR relies on the impugned order.
4\. We have considered the rival submissions. We find that identical issue has
been decided in the case of Sicpa India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) wherein following
has been observed.
5\. Rebutting the contention of the appellant that no liability of service tax
arises on the Agreement between appellant and SICPA Holding Switzerland, since
the Agreement was for providing technical assistance, the Ld. Counsel for the
department contended that in view of Article 5 of Technical Collaboration
Agreement (page 123 of the Appeal Paper-Book), SICPA Holding Switzerland has
granted to the appellant exclusive technical information under all the
relevant Patents and in view of that, Royalty of 5 per cent on the net sale of
all the products was to be paid. Article 7 of the said Agreement clearly
states that the licensee will be given right to Patents in India in respect of
the products on payment of Royalty. As regards the contention of the appellant
that no Patents are registered in India, the Learned Counsel for the
department submitted that Switzerland being a notifying country under Section
133 of the Patent Act, 1970 for the purposes of Patents, clearly shows that
substantial protection under the Patent's Act was available to the appellant
as well, and the appellant is liable to service tax on the services given by
SICPA Holding Switzerland to the appellant. It is also the contention of the
Learned Counsel for the department that the transfer of know- how as per the
Technical Agreement was not on one time basis but was on continual basis, and
was to be transmitted to enable the appellant to manufacture the products on
continual basis. In so far as the contention of the appellant that they are
entitled to abatement for the R & D. Cess paid for correct computation of the
liability, the Learned Counsel for the department submitted that the Learned
adjudicating authority has clearly observed that in the absence of disclosure
of the total amount of Royalty paid to the appellant, vide letter dated
5-6-2008 issued by the jurisdictional Range Officer, the appellant had not
been able to substantiate their claim of incorrect computation of liability.
As regards the limitation aspect, the contention of the Learned Counsel for
the department is that pursuant to the said Agreement in 1991, though they
received services six to seven months prior to the levy of Tax on the said
services, but they did not register themselves with the department, nor did
they pay any Service Tax during the period May, 2005 to March, 2009, which
clearly establishes an intention to evade payment of Service Tax and hence,
the demand is not time-barred.
6\. From the records it appears that identical issue has come up before the
Tribunal in the case of Reliance Industries Ltd. v. CCE & ST, LTU, Mumbai
[2016 (44) S.T.R. 82 (Tri.-Mumbai). The relevant portion of the said judgement
is reproduced below :-
3|Page ST/595/2010-DB "6. While deciding this we have to bear in mind that?
India is a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial
Properties. The said convention was the first major step taken to help
creators of intellectual property to ensure that their intellectual works were
protected in other countries. In furtherance to the same a Patent Cooperation
Treaty, was signed by member countries, the same has been embodied in Chapter
XXII of the Patents Act, 1970. The said treaty spells out a detailed mechanism
for the filing of international applications by an inventor and provides that
once such an application is made and registered in the member country, then
the IPR would be protected in that member country. Thus, there appears to be a
codified law providing for Recognition and Protection under the Indian Laws
even in respect of Patents registered overseas. In our view, when the
legislature has specifically provided that an Intellectual Property Right,
that could be taxed as an IPR service is a right to an intangible property,
which is recognised under any law for the time being in force, obviously the
law being referred to here has to be an Indian Law and not the recognition of
the intangible property right under the law of a third country. If an
intangible property right was to refer to a right which is recognised by any
country, then the legislature would not have used the expression "under any
law for the time being in force". The legislature would have merely stated
that an Intellectual Property Right would mean any right to an intangible
property. There would have been no need for it to qualify the same with a
recognition under any law for the time being in force."
7\. Further the issue came up before the Tribunal in the case of Chambal
Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd. v. CCE, Jaipur-I [2016 (45) S.T.R. 118
(Tri.-Del.)]. Relevant portion of the said judgement is reproduced below :-
> "5. We have heard both sides and examined the appeal records. The only point
> for decision is that whether or not the appellant received taxable service
> under the category of "Intellectual Property Right service" during the
> relevant period. The admitted facts of the case are that the technical know-
> how, engineering design licence involved in these agreements with foreign
> service providers are not registered in India under Indian law. However, the
> original authority held that registration of IPR under Indian law is only
> for obtaining protection from its infringement. He observed that the levy of
> tax is not dependent on the fact of such registration. We find that such
> conclusion is not legally tenable and is beyond the scope of taxable service
> as defined in Finance Act, 1994 :
> "Section 65(105)(zzr) of the Act defines in the taxable IPR service tax as
> under :
> "Taxable service" means any service provided or to be provided to any person
> by the holder of intellectual property right, in relation to intellectual
> property service;
> Section 65(55a) of the Act defines "Intellectual Property Right" to mean as
> under :
> "Intellectual Property Right" means any right to intangible property,
> namely, trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible
> property, under any law for the time being in force, but does not include
> copyright."
> 4|Page ST/595/2010-DB
> 6\. The IPR as defined should be a right under any law for the time being in
> force. The legal position on this issue has been examined by various
> decisions of the Tribunal which are as under :
> (a) Rochem Separation Systems (India) Private Limited v. Commissioner of
> Service Tax, Mumbai-I
> \- 2015 (39) S.T.R. 112 (Tri.-Mum.) [para 8];

In the instant case too no evidence of any regulation in India of Technical
know-how as IPR has been produced. Thus, the technical know-how cannot be
treated as an IPR under any law for the time being in force. Relying on the
aforesaid decision in identical case, the appeal is allowed.
