ORDER S.S. Kang, Vice President
1\. Heard both sides.
2\. The appellant filed this appeal against the order passed by the
Commissioner of Customs whereby CHA licence of the appellant was suspended
under Regulation 20(2) of the Customs House Agents Licensing Regulations,
2004.
3\. The main contention of the appellant is that no notice was issued before
passing suspension order. It is also submitted by the appellant that the
Tribunal in various decisions held that notice is necessary before passing the
suspension order. The appellant also submitted that the order is passed
without application of mind as there is no evidence against the appellant that
he is party to fraud committed by two other persons. The contention is that
prior to passing the impugned order the statements were recorded where they
admitted that they had defrauded the Custom authorities.
4\. The appellant relied upon the decision of Single Bench of the Tribunal in
immediate action is necessary. In such a case even without giving notice the
licence could be suspended. We make it clear that the observations of the
CESTAT that in all cases of suspension the procedure under Regulation 22(1)
out to have been followed in the sense prior notice before suspension ought to
be given cannot be sustained.
9.1 The Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of Cargomar v. CCE (supra) had
also taken the same view. In view of above decision of Hon'ble High Court we
find no merit in the contention that notice is necessary before passing the
order under Regulation 20(2).
9.2 Further, we find that in the present case in the impugned order, the
Commissioner after taking into consideration the fraud to the tune of Rs. 1.68
crores by making clearance of imported goods by way of making duty payment
under DEPB scheme against various bills of entries. The appellants are not
disputing that these bills of entries were not dealt with by him. In these
circumstances, we find that it is not a case where the impugned order does not
spell out reasons of any immediate action. In view of the discussion and in
4\. The appellant relied upon the decision of Single Bench of the Tribunal in
the case of Unison Clearing (P) Ltd. v. CC and where the licence of another
CHA was suspended on the basis of the same investigation. The Tribunal after
following the Division Bench decision of the Tribunal in the case of Unison
Clearing (P) Ltd. v. CC reported in 2006 (198) ELT 513 set aside the order of
suspension.
5\. The appellant also relied upon the various decisions of Hon'ble High Court
where it has been held that suspension of licence is not sustainable because
impugned order does not spell out that any immediate action was required to be
taken in the matter nor the order indicate that such action was indeed
warranted.
6\. The contention of the Revenue is that the show cause notice for revocation
of the licence has been issued on 7.12.06 and appellant also filed a detailed
reply to that show-cause notice. The Revenue relied upon the following
decisions of the Hon'ble Madras High Court:
(1) Sindhu Cargo Services Ltd. v. CC .
(2) Cargomar v. CCE .
7\. The Revenue also relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
the case of CC v. Raj Clearing Agency . The contention of the Revenue is that
in the above decisions, the Hon'ble High Court held that as per the provisions
of Regulation 20(2) of the Regulations even without giving notice the licence
could be suspended.
8\. The contention of the Revenue is that in this case the appellant signed
the bill of entries which was subsequently found that the forged entry was
made regarding payment of duty and whereby the goods were cleared by
mentioning to fictitious DEPB licence numbers and signatures of the Custom
officers were also forged.
9\. We find that in this case the main contention of the appellant is that no
show-cause notice has been issued prior to passing the suspension order. We
find that the Tribunal in some cases held that notice is required before
passing the order for suspension under Regulation 20(2). We find that this
issue is came before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CC v. Raj
Clearing Agency. The Hon'ble High Court held as under:
In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it was a case for invoking
Regulation 20(2) of the said Regulations which is meant only in cases where
immediate action is necessary. In such a case even without giving notice the
licence could be suspended. We make it clear that the observations of the
CESTAT that in all cases of suspension the procedure under Regulation 22(1)
out to have been followed in the sense prior notice before suspension ought to
be given cannot be sustained.
9.1 The Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of Cargomar v. CCE (supra) had
also taken the same view. In view of above decision of Hon'ble High Court we
find no merit in the contention that notice is necessary before passing the
order under Regulation 20(2).
9.2 Further, we find that in the present case in the impugned order, the
Commissioner after taking into consideration the fraud to the tune of Rs. 1.68
crores by making clearance of imported goods by way of making duty payment
under DEPB scheme against various bills of entries. The appellants are not
disputing that these bills of entries were not dealt with by him. In these
circumstances, we find that it is not a case where the impugned order does not
spell out reasons of any immediate action. In view of the discussion and in
view of the various decisions of High Court where it has been held that notice
is not necessary before issuing order of suspension under Regulation 20(2) of
the Regulation. We find no merit in the appeal, the same is dismissed.
