Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1\. The plaintiffs, in this suit seek a permanent injunction restraining the
rejection of the latter's application in 2004. In Midas Hygene, the Supreme
Court held that:
> "The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either of
> trade mark or of copyright, normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay
> in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such
> cases. The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie
> appears that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest."
On an overall consideration of all factors, the court is of the opinion that
the balance of convenience in this case lies in granting the ad interim
injunction. The defendant took a calculated risk in using the HAMDARD word and
eye mark; indeed its use of the eye mark points to an attempt to "free ride"
on the plaintiff's reputation. Unless injuncted, the plaintiff would continue
to suffer commercially.
31\. In view of the above reasons, the application has to succeed. IA
7385/2004 is hereby allowed; the order dated 4-11-2004 is confirmed and shall
bind the parties till disposal of the suit. The parties shall bear their
1\. The plaintiffs, in this suit seek a permanent injunction restraining the
defendants from infringing their trademark, copyright and for restraining them
from passing off their goods as those of the plaintiffs'. The plaintiffs also
seek an order for rendition of accounts and delivery up of goods. By this
application I.A.
CS(OS) 1240/2004 1 of 23 7385/2004, an ad interim injunction to restrain the
defendant from using the plaintiff's trademark in the word HAMDARD and the
visual mark associated with it, is sought. The court had, by ex parte orders,
granted the injunction. This order proposes to dispose of that interim
application.
2\. The first plaintiff is a charitable institution registered under the
Societies Act, 1860, whereas the second plaintiff is a wakf, having its office
in Delhi. It is averred that both the plaintiffs are part of the Hamdard
Group, which is involved in the practice, and manufacture of Unani medicines.
It is averred that they have been using the mark 'Hamdard Dawakhana' since
1906. The first plaintiff is the proprietor of the mark 'Hamdard', and it has
been put to use in respect of an entire range of goods and services offered by
the Hamdard Group. The plaintiffs trace the establishment of the HAMDARD group
to a small clinic, by Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed, in 1906, which acquired
considerable reputation resulting in its conversion into a charitable trust,
in 1948, through the second plaintiff. The second plaintiff engages itself in
a whole range of activities, and uses modern analytical techniques and
scientific methods of assessment and quality control of its products to ensure
uniform quality and efficacy of its medicines. It is alleged that the to
achieve the objectives of the group more effectively, the first plaintiff
foundation was formed in 1964\.
3\. The plaintiffs contend that the ownership and proprietorship of the mark
HAMDARD is used conspicuously in relation to their products. This mark is
widely recognized as the house mark of the HAMDARD group; the plaintiffs are
owners of CS(OS) 1240/2004 2 of 23 marks such as HAMDARD EYE DESIGN, HAMDARD
BALM, HAMDARD MANJAN, HAMDARD HAJLAN, HAMDARD MARHAM, HAMDARD GRIPE WATER and
other label as well as device marks. The first plaintiff has permitted the use
of its marks, through deeds of assignment, to the second plaintiff. The second
plaintiff thus uses and markets its products under the HAMDARD banner, in
respect of its ROOH AFZA, SUALIN, SAFI, CINKARA, NAUNIHAL, PACHNOL, GOGHAN
BADAM SHIRIN, HOSHINA, HAMDARD GRIPE WATER brands. The plaintiff's "EYE
DESIGN" was first used in 1958, and continued in use, till it was altered in
1968; in its altered form it has been pervasively used by the second
plaintiff. The plaintiffs hold 37 registrations of the mark HAMDARD and the
eye design, in relation to diverse goods and products. According to the suit
averments, the extensive use of the HAMDARD mark and the eye design associate
them with the plaintiff's superior quality products, available in and outside
the country. It is also claimed that the mark and the design, which is also a
mark, are well known and famous trademarks, which have acquired
distinctiveness.
4\. According to the plaintiffs, the defendant is using the word mark HAMDARD
in relation to processing and marketing rice, necessitating the present suit.
The plaintiffs allege that the defendants are indulging in misappropriation
and misuse of their marks and eye design, amounting to infringement. The
plaintiffs, it is averred came across the defendant's mark in 1992in relation
to rice, resulting in issuance of a cease and desist notice to the latter on
20th March 1992. The plaintiff also claims to have come across an
advertisement of the defendant's trademark application in CS(OS) 1240/2004 3
of 23 October 2000 for registration of the mark in the Trade Marks Journal for
registration of the mark and label, in respect of Class 30. The impugned label
marks comprised, inter alia, the marks HAMDARD BRAND DEHRADOONI BASMATI RICE,
the HAMDARD logo which is identical to the plaintiffs' registered trademark
HAMDARD EYE design as well as the trading style of the defendant, HAMDARD
industries. The plaintiff lodged its notice of opposition premising their
objection under Sections 9, 11, 12, 18(1) of the Trade Marks Act. The
Assistant Registrar, it is alleged, has allowed the plaintiffs' objections and
refused to register the defendant's marks, by order dated 23rd July, 2004. The
plaintiffs are relying on the said order; they also rely on the registration
certificates issued in their favour, as well as comparison of the two marks,
to say that the defendant's impugned marks amount to infringement of their
marks; besides, it is claimed that the plaintiff's trademarks have acquired
such distinctiveness reputation and goodwill as to be called famous marks; the
defendants' use of these marks is dishonest. Though in relation to rice, the
defendants' use of the marks is likely to result in injurious association, to
the plaintiff, and members of the general public would be deceived into
believing that their (defendants) products are those of the plaintiffs. The
use of mark and logo, similar, if not identical to the plaintiff, is bound to
confuse and deceive the consumer into believing that the goods are of the
plaintiff.
5\. Mr. Mohit Lahoty, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs,
at the very outset sought to dispel the contention that the plaintiffs have
acquiesced in the defendants' use of the word mark as well as the eye device.
Relying on Power CS(OS) 1240/2004 4 of 23 Control Appliances v. Sumeet
Machines, (1994) 2 SCC 448 and Hindustan Pencils v. India Stationery, AIR 1990
Del 19, he contended that for the defense of acquiescence to succeed, the
defendant must show that not only has there been a delay on the part of the
plaintiff, but also that there was some positive act of encouragement on
behalf of its behalf, which should have let the defendant into a false sense
of security. In this case, counsel pointed out that steps were taken to oppose
the defendants' application for registration and cease and desist notices were
also sent. Counsel further pointed out that a mere delay in bringing an action
is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in cases involving trademark
infringement. In this regard he placed reliance on Midas Hygiene v. Sudhir
Bhatia, 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC). Further he submitted that this was a classic
case of passing off as it satisfied all three elements; existence of
reputation, possibility of deception and likelihood of damages.
6\. Learned counsel argued that to arrive at a determination of deceptive
similarity, the Court would consider the nature of the mark-whether it is a
composite mark, which includes both words and labels; the degree of
resemblances both visual and phonetic; the nature and character of goods; the
class of purchasers and any other surrounding circumstances. Reliance was
placed on Cadila Health Care v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals, (2001) 5 SCC 73 and
Laximkant Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah, 2002 (24) PTC 1 (SC). It was also argued
that in an action for passing off, the plaintiff is not required to establish
the fraudulent intention on the part of the defendant nor is the former
required to prove actual confusion amongst the CS(OS) 1240/2004 5 of 23
customers. This position of law, learned counsel argued, found support in
Ciba- Geigy Limited v. Surinder Singh, 1998 PTC (18) 545. Counsel also relied
on Bata India v. Pyare Lal, AIR 1985 All 242 and Alfred Dunhill v. Kartar
Singh, 1999 (19) PTC 294 to argue the Court should keep in mind the ordinary
customer shopping in places where both the plaintiffs and defendants goods are
available for purchase and the usual conditions under which such purchase
would be made, to determine the deceptive similarity among the goods. Counsel
further submitted even a disclaimer would not reduce the deceptive similarity
among the marks. He pointed out that the plaintiffs had registered their mark
under Class 30 in all goods, which includes rice. Therefore, there was
possibility that the plaintiffs could use the mark in relation to rice and
rice products too. Lastly, it was urged that the trade channels of products of
the plaintiff and defendants overlapped, since the plaintiffs were also
selling food products under brands such as ROOH AFZA and other such goods. In
such circumstances, where there was a likelihood of goods being available
under the same roof, the possibility of confusion and deception was real.
7\. The defendants submit the mark 'Hamdard', which means 'Dusaro ke dard se
sarokar', is a common dictionary term incapable of being appropriated by any
entity. They submit that the defendants have been using a trade label which
comprises of may other distinctive features, including "Dehraduni Basmati
Rice," the name of their firm along with the address, which is quite
distinctive from that of the plaintiffs' mark. It is further submitted that
the goods of the plaintiffs and the defendants are completely different and
that the plaintiffs have not produced even a CS(OS) 1240/2004 6 of 23 single
document that they have dealt with rice or intend to do any business in rice.
Therefore, they submit that no deceptive similarity can arise between the two
marks as they are used in relation to completely different products.
8\. It is further averred by the defendants that they have bonafide adopted
the mark since 1989 with respect to its goods and that mark has become
distinctive with their brand of basmati rice. They claim entitlement to
protection under section 12 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereafter 'the Act')
as they are honest concurrent users. Further they allege that the suit suffers
from acquiescence, delay, laches, estoppel and waiver. It is claimed that the
delay of twelve years from the issue of legal notices in 1992 is sufficient to
bar the suit. Further, for the said period the plaintiffs have allowed to the
defendants to continue with their label, which amounts to acquiescence in law.
9\. Mr. Suman, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants contended
that this is a case where the plaintiffs and the defendants are engaged in the
business of non-competing/ dissimilar goods and therefore, no question of
deceptive similarity arises. He also argued, relying on Veerumal v. Needle
Industries, 2001 PTC 889 (Del) (DB) and Hindustan Pencils Private Limited v.
Universal Trading Company, 2000 PTC 561 (DB), that though delay itself may not
constitute a defence in a suit for infringement, if the defendant is allowed
to expend money for a considerable amount of time in setting up a business, he
cannot be now asked to stop the business. Counsel pointed out in this regard
that the time period of twelve years was considerable and that the plaintiffs'
action amounted to acquiescence in CS(OS) 1240/2004 7 of 23 law. He drew the
attention of the Court to the documents produced to show that sales figures of
the defendants run into about 25 crores rupees between the year 1990 and 2002.
Reliance was also placed on the judgment reported as Relaxo Rubber Limited v.
Aman Cable Company, 1998 PTC (18) 759 to argue that in cases where the
plaintiffs' and the defendants' goods belong to different classes there can be
no deceptive similarity and therefore, unlikelihood of confusion in the minds
of the public. Similarly, counsel relied on Roshan Lal Oil Mills v. Assam
Company, 1996 PTC (16) to support his argument on dissimilar goods and lack of
deceptive similarity.
10\. Before a discussion on the substantive law, the question of delay and
latches will have to be dealt with. The Supreme Court in Midas Hygiene v.
Sudhir Bhatia, 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC) has now settled the question of delay in
bringing an action for infringement of trademark. It categorically held that
Division Bench in that case was "entirely wrong in vacating the injunction
merely on the ground of delay and latches". Both cases relied on by the
defendants in this case were decided prior to the decision in Midas Hygiene.
Moreover, both those case cannot be considered binding decisions relating to
question of delay in relation to an action for infringement. While Hindustan
Pencils (supra) dealt with delay in relation to rectification proceedings
before the Registrar, the Court in Veerumal (supra) had found that the
registered mark was not is use for a considerable period, thereby losing its
distinctiveness. It held:
> "Though delay by itself would not be a defense but if there was a non-
> CS(OS) 1240/2004 8 of 23 user for a long period of time the mark would lose
> its distinctiveness or the mark is then permitted to die for non-user. The
> Bombay High Court observed "It is well settled that lapse of time may bring
> about a change in the state of things in such a manner that to grant
> injunction in favor of the plaintiff's would be harsh and it may cause
> irreparable damage or harm to the rights of the defendants." Thus the Bombay
> High Court was of the view that non-use of trademark does have a bearing in
> action for infringement specially at the interlocutory stage and equities
> would have to be balanced in such a situation."
11\. This Court, in Hindustan Pencils v. India Stationery Products, 1989 PTC
61, extensively discussed the question of acquiescence. The Court after
considering a number of cases, both Indian and English, approvingly quoted the
following passage from Kerly on Trademark:
> "The classic case of acquiescence proper is where the proprietor, knowing of
> his rights and knowing that the infringer is ignorant of them, does
> something to encourage the infringer's misapprehension, with the result that
> the infringe acts upon his mistaken belief and so worsens his position. It
> seems clear that something legs than that is needed to offer a defense, but
> how much less is not clear. The current tendency is to hold that a defense
> of acquiescence or laces may be set up whenever it is unconscionable for the
> plaintiff to deny anything that he (consciously or unconsciously) has
> allowed or encore aged the defendant to believe. Mere failure to without
> some positive act of encouragement is not in general enough to give a
> defense. A defendant who infringes knowing of the plaintiffs mark can hardly
> complain if he is later sued upon it, nor is a defendant who starts to
> infringe without searching the Register of Trade Marks in any better
> position than if he had searched and so learned of the plaintiffs mark. Acts
> of the proprietor done in ignorance of the infringement, or even done
> without his own registration in mind, will not amount to acquiescence."
The Court also observed that:
> "It may, however, be stated that it will be for the defendant in such cases
> to prove acquiescence by the plaintiff. Acquiescence cannot be inferred
> merely by reason of the fact that the plaintiff has not taken any action
> against the infringement of, its rights."
> CS(OS) 1240/2004 9 of 23
> 12\. It is relevant to extract the relevant provisions of the Act:
> Section 2 (1)(h): 'deceptively similar'- A mark shall be deemed to be

    CS(OS) 1240/2004                                                          10 of 23

                         b)      is detrimental to its distinctive character; or
                         c)      is against the reputation of the trade mark.

> trademark.
Therefore, in order to fall within section 29(1), the defendant's use of the
mark must be so that it is likely that the public assumes that the said mark
is used as a trademark. Section 29(2) deals with three situations; one where
the defendants mark is identical to that of the plaintiff and in respect of
similar goods. Two, where the marks are similar and in respect of goods which
are identical or similar. Three, the marks as well as the goods are identical.
However, to constitute infringement mere satisfaction of one of the three
would be insufficient; the plaintiff has to establish that such use by the
defendant is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or is likely
to have an association with the registered mark. Section 29(3) states that
where both the mark and the goods in respect of the marks are identical, then
the court shall presume that such use by the defendant is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public. For the present purposes Section 29 (4)
is relevant; it deals with cases where the marks are identical or similar but
the goods with respect to the marks are dissimilar. For applicability of this
provision, the registered mark must have a reputation in India and the use of
the mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the
distinctive character or repute of the registered trademark.
14\. As to what is the appropriate standard to adjudge infringement of a
registered trademark is no longer open to debate; the issue has been settled
now for almost four decades. The standard to be adopted in such cases is that
of "likelihood CS(OS) 1240/2004 12 of 23 of confusion" and not actual
deception and actual damage. The Court, in such cases is to determine the
likelihood of confusion and deceptive similarity in order to arrive at a prima
facie finding of infringement keeping in mind the following considerations:
(i) the broad and essential features of the of competing marks will have to be
viewed,
(ii) the marks will have to be considered as a whole in their respective
contexts, (iii) the similarities rather than dissimilarities will have to be
taken note of and (iv) the marks must be judged from the point of view of
unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection.
15\. The above standard has been established and applied in Ruston and Hornsby
v. Zamindara Engineering Co, (1969) 2 SCC 727, Parle Products v. JP & Co., AIR
1972 SC 1359, Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, Cadila
Health Care v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals, (2001) 5 SCC 73 and Heinz Italia v.
Dabur India (2007) 6 SCC 1.
16\. Now coming to the argument of the plaintiff's marks being "famous" and
therefore, deserving a greater degree of protection, it would be appropriate
to deal with this aspect at some length. In Honda Motors Co. Ltd. v. Charanjit
Singh & Ors., 101 (2002) DLT 359 this court restrained the defendants from
using the trademark HONDA in respect of pressure cookers after taking note of
number of decisions on the subject. In Bata India Limited v. Pyare Lal & Co.,
AIR 1985 All 242, the defendant who used the mark "Bata Foam" on the
mattresses, sofa cushions and other articles CS(OS) 1240/2004 13 of 23 was
injuncted from user of the mark on the ground that the name Bata was well-
known in the market and the user of such a name was not only likely to cause
deception in the mind of ordinary customer but could also cause injury to the
plaintiff-Company and the fact that the plaintiff was not producing foam was
not enough to hold that there could not be passing off action in respect of
the user of the name 'Bata' to the products marketed by the defendant.
17\. Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Anr. v. Surinder Singh and Ors., 1998 PTC (18) 545
was a case where the plaintiff was using the mark CIBA, CIBACA in relation to
goods different than those of the defendant's. The defendant was using the
trade mark CIBACA in relation to filters for motor vehicles. The case of the
defendant was that the goods in question were entirely different and as such
there was no question of any deception being cause in the minds of the public,
when trade mark CIBACA was used in relation to altogether different goods.
While coming to the conclusion that the defendant had adopted the mark CIBACA
deliberately with the intention of creating confusion in the minds of the
public so as to pass off its goods as those of the plaintiff, the Court
granted injunction restraining the defendants from using the plaintiff's trade
mark by the defendants for altogether different goods, as the use of the trade
mark CIBACA by the defendant was held not to be honest.
18\. In Sunder Parmanand Lalwani and Ors. v. Caltex (India) Ltd., AIR 1969
Bombay the marks were not in relation to similar goods; the plaintiff's mark
"Caltex" pertained to petroleum products, whereas the applicant/ defendants
trade was in relation to watches. The court held that though the goods were
different, there was CS(OS) 1240/2004 14 of 23 a likelihood of injurious
association of the defendant's mark in relation to the plaintiff's trade. In
Lego System Aktieselskab and Anr. v. Lego M. Lemelstrich Ltd., Fleet Street
Reports (1983); the plaintiff was using the trade mark Lego in respect of
toys, whereas defendant started using the trade mark LEGO in relation to
irrigation equipment. Even though the trade mark LEGO was being used for
different products, the Court granted injunction against the defendant holding
that the plaintiff had established high reputation for the mark Lego which
extended beyond the field of toys and construction kits and the mark Lego had
acquired distinctiveness as the products of the plaintiff.
19\. In The Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. The Dunlop Lubricant Co., 1899
(16) RPC 12, the plaintiff was using the trade mark DUNLOP in respect of tyres
whereas the defendant was using the same in respect of oil and lubricants. On
a suit for passing off action filed by the plaintiff, defendant was restrained
from using the mark DUNLOP for its products and for its business name. M/s.
Banga Watch Company v. M/s. N.V. Philiphs and Anr., AIR 1983 P & H 418 was a
case where the plaintiff M/s. N.V. Philliphs was using the trade mark
PHILLIPHS, which had become a household mark and had acquired enviable
reputation in India and throughout the world dealing in electrical and
electronic goods. The defendant was using the trade mark PHILLIPHS in respect
of watches and clocks. The court granted the injunction claimed.
    The Canadian position
    CS(OS) 1240/2004                                                      15 of 23
20\. In the recent decision, Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc., [2006] 1
S.C.R. 772, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected opposition to use and
registration of Baribie in relation to a restaurant. While doing so, it was
reasoned that the mere fact that a mark was famous did not entitle its owner
to the monopoly in relation to unrelated products and services; the court
insisted on certain objective markers, which the "famous" mark had to satisfy
if the claim for monopoly were to be granted. These included:
(1) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the
extent to which they have become known (2) the length of time the trade-marks
and trade-names have been in use (3) the nature of the wares, services or
business (4) the nature of the trade (5) the degree of resemblance between the
trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by
them (6) other surrounding circumstances While the relevant issue is
"likelihood of confusion" and not "actual confusion", the lack of "actual
confusion" is a factor which the courts have found of significance when
determining the "likelihood of confusion". An adverse inference may be drawn
when concurrent use on the evidence is extensive, yet no evidence of confusion
has been given by the opponent. A similar reasoning persuaded the Canadian
Supreme Court to deny protection in Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques
Cliquot Ltée, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 824. The VEUVE CLICQUOT trade-mark is a famous
mark in relation to champagne. The brand of Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin also
appeared on a range of promotional items, not offered for sale in Canada,
including CS(OS) 1240/2004 16 of 23 fashion wares for women and men. It was
acknowledged as undoubtedly a famous trade-mark that deserved "wide protection
not only from free-riders but from those who, without any intention of free-
riding, nevertheless use in their own business distinguishing marks that
create confusion or depreciate the value of the goodwill". The appellant
sought to prevent the respondents' group of six women's wear shops in Quebec
and eastern Ontario from using the trade-name Cliquot and the respondents' own
registered trade-marks Cliquot and Cliquot "Un monde à part", and to have
these trade-marks expunged from the Register. The Canadian Supreme Court
refused protection, and dismissed the appeal. The US Position
21\. The leading authority in the United States was the Supreme Court decision
in Moseley, Victor's Little Secret, Petitioners v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc 537
US 418 (2003). V Secret Catalogue, Inc., the affiliated corporations that own
the "Victoria's Secret" trademarks, filed a suit, alleging that the name
"Victor's Little Secret" contributed to "the dilution of famous marks" under
the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA). The law defined "dilution" as "the
lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods
or services." The District Court granted V Secret summary judgment on the FTDA
claim. The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that V Secret's mark was
distinctive and that the evidence established dilution even though no actual
harm had been proved. The US Supreme Court reversed these concurrent findings,
holding that the standard contemplated by the CS(OS) 1240/2004 17 of 23
amendment to the Lanham Act was not "likelihood of dilution" but actual
dilution. It was held that:
> "This text unambiguously requires a showing of actual dilution, rather than
> a likelihood of dilution.
> This conclusion is fortified by the definition of the term "dilution"
> itself. That definition provides:
> "The term 'dilution' means the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to
> identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or
> absence of-
> "(1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties, or
> "(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception." §1127.
> The contrast between the initial reference to an actual "lessening of the
> capacity" of the mark, and the later reference to a "likelihood of
> confusion, mistake, or deception" in the second caveat confirms the
> conclusion that actual dilution must be established.
Of course, that does not mean that the consequences of dilution, such as an
actual loss of sales or profits, must also be proved. To the extent that
language in the Fourth Circuit's opinion in the Ringling Bros. case suggests
otherwise, see 170 F.3d, at 460--465, we disagree. We do agree, however, with
that court's conclusion that, at least where the marks at issue are not
identical, the mere fact that consumers mentally associate the junior user's
mark with a famous mark is not sufficient to establish actionable dilution. As
the facts of that case demonstrate, such mental association will not
necessarily reduce the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of
its owner, the statutory requirement for dilution under the FTDA. For even
though Utah drivers may be reminded of the circus when they see a license
plate referring to the "greatest snow on earth," it by no means follows that
they will associate "the greatest show on earth" with skiing or snow sports,
or associate it less strongly or exclusively with the circus. "Blurring" is
not a necessary consequence of mental CS(OS) 1240/2004 18 of 23 association.
(Nor, for that matter, is "tarnishing.")"
22\. The consequence of the Supreme Court judgment was a swift Congressional
intervention; by amendment to the Trademark Dilution Revision Act, (effective
October 6, 2006), the standard of "likelihood of dilution" was affirmed; the
amendment provided inter alia, that:
> "...the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or through
> acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another
> person who, at any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences
> use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by
> blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the
> presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of
> actual economic injury.
23\. The above discussion shows that the standard for deciding what amounts to
infringement of trademarks in relation to goods and products, which are
dissimilar, is much the same; it is "likelihood of deception". The standards
in such cases, in Canada however, are case sensitive. The court considers a
variety of factors, besides the "famous mark" doctrine. The US standard, which
was similar to the Canadian one (actual damage, rather than likelihood of
damage) has now been changed, with effect from 6th October, 2006.
24\. In the present case, the plaintiffs have produced the two competing
marks. Besides, the plaintiffs have produced registration certificates, and
renewals in relation to the marks, being Ex. P-1/11 to Ex. P-1/29, in various
Classes of the Trademarks Act. These include original registrations, some
secured more than 50 years ago, as well as renewals. They also rely on a copy
of the order of the Assistant CS(OS) 1240/2004 19 of 23 Registrar, Trademarks,
rejecting the defendants application for registration of the HAMDARD mark for
its products; the order is produced as EX. P-2. In an affidavit, affirmed on
its behalf, the plaintiffs assert that their sales grew from Rs.
21,05,56,210/- in 1985 to Rs. 34,94,20,680/- in 1989. The plaintiff has also
produced a large number of invoices and bills in support of its claim for sale
of its products, which not only include medical and pharmaceutical related
goods, but also food products.
25\. The defendants' position is that they have been using the mark since 1989
the plaintiff was aware of this, issued a cease and desist notice, and did not
choose to take any action. Now, more than 15 years later, it cannot seek to
disturb the its well entrenched business. The defendant claims distinctiveness
in relation to its products for the last 15 years; according to it, its sales
too have climbed; for the last three years, the sales were about Rs. 2 crores,
annually. It is also contended that the goods of the plaintiff are unrelated,
and therefore, there is no likelihood of confusion or deception.
26\. It is no doubt an undeniable fact that the plaintiff was aware about the
defendants' activity, and had even issued a cease and desist notice, in 1992.
However, this factor, to support the argument of latches or acquiescence, is
insubstantial, because of the holding of the Supreme Court in Midas Hygene.
When the court considers, in an infringement suit, the issue of delay, in
relation to the defendant's argument about being in business for long, the
relative inaction of the CS(OS) 1240/2004 20 of 23 plaintiff, is not seen as a
disabling factor for grant of ad-interim relief. The exception to this could
be where the defendant can establish prior use of the mark, before the
plaintiff's use. Such, however is not the case here.
27\. The plaintiff no doubt has averred to the HAMDARD marks being famous in
nature. Yet, apart from sales figures, and the relative antiquity, nothing
more has been shown. Unlike in other jurisdictions, there is no separate
famous marks registry, to protect claims. However, Indian courts have, in
several instances, recognized and given protection to such claims. The recent
trends in Canada, and pre-2006 decisions in the United States have shown that
the mere advertence to existence of a famous mark, by itself is insufficient
to guarantee an injunctive relief. Court, particularly in Canada, have
insisted on the plaintiff establishing injurious association, in the case of
dissimilar goods.
28\. As analyzed in the previous part of this judgment, plaintiffs can
successfully secure relief on the ground of deceptive similarity of the
impugned mark, even in relation to dissimilar goods. The courts' inquiry in
such cases too has to be the same, i.e whether the impugned mark so resembles
the plaintiffs' mark as to deceive the consumer into believing that the goods
or products (though dissimilar) originate from the plaintiff. In this case,
the points of resemblance are prominent: one, the HAMDARD word mark; and, two,
the distinctive "eye" design, of the plaintiff, which also appears in the
defendant's mark, in a prominent manner. The defendant has been using the mark
since 1989. Apart from stating that the word HAMDARD is CS(OS) 1240/2004 21 of
23 common, it has not justified why it hit upon the idea of using the word.
This factor is also of some significance, as, if the explanation was a cogent
one, or pointed to some generic origin, in relation to the defendant's goods,
that could have supported its position. The word mark HAMDARD is arbitrary in
relation to Basmati rice, which is traded by the defendant. In this contextual
background, the plaintiffs' complaint that its trademark was copied, and is
sought to be appropriated by the defendant cannot be brushed aside.
29\. The goods are to some extent dissimilar; yet there is likelihood of
confusion or deception, on account of overlapping trade channels. The
plaintiff's argument that both its goods and those of the defendant can be
purchased from the same traders, cannot be brushed aside. If this is taken
together with the fact that the plaintiff's HAMDARD brand is also host to an
entire range of food products such as soft drink concentrates and recipes,
like ROOH AFZA, etc, which are sold commonly across the country, even in
grocery or small departmental and utility stores, which also sell foodgrains,
the plaintiff's apprehensions are not fanciful. In these circumstances, the
court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has been able to establish, prima
facie, that though the goods are dissimilar, the degree of resemblance, and
nature of products is such that the defendants goods are likely to be confused
with that of those of the plaintiffs, and the latter is likely to suffer from
such injurious association.
30\. As far as balance of convenience is concerned, the record shows that the
CS(OS) 1240/2004 22 of 23 plaintiff no doubt did not take steps after the
cease and desist notice was issued on its behalf in 1992, yet, it challenged
the defendants' attempt to secure registration, culminating in the order of
rejection of the latter's application in 2004. In Midas Hygene, the Supreme
Court held that:
> "The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either of
> trade mark or of copyright, normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay
> in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such
> cases. The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie
> appears that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest."
On an overall consideration of all factors, the court is of the opinion that
the balance of convenience in this case lies in granting the ad interim
injunction. The defendant took a calculated risk in using the HAMDARD word and
eye mark; indeed its use of the eye mark points to an attempt to "free ride"
on the plaintiff's reputation. Unless injuncted, the plaintiff would continue
to suffer commercially.
31\. In view of the above reasons, the application has to succeed. IA
