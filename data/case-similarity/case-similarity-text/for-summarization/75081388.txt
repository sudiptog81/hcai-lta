This appeal of the assessee emanates from the order passed by Assessing
Officer u/s 144C(1) read with section 143(3) dated 23rd September, 2011
relevant to assessment year 2008-09 whereby besides challenging action of the
Assessing Officer in holding that payment received by the assessee from sale
of software and provisions of maintenance and other supports services to
customers in India were taxable as "Royalty", in terms of section 9(1)(vi) of
the Income-tax Act, 1961 as well in Article 12 of India US Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement, assessee has also challenged charging of interest u/s
234B of the Act.
2 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
2\. Facts indicate that assessee had filed original return of income for the
relevant assessment year on 29.09.2008 declaring nil income and claimed a
refund of Rs.61,58,059/-. Thereafter, the return was revised on 19.02.2010
wherein the assessee declared nil income and claimed a refund of
Rs.121,24,329/-. Notice u/s 143(2) along with questionnaire issued was duly
served upon the assessee. In response thereto representative of the assessee
appeared before the Assessing Officer from time to time, filed requisite
details and case was discussed with him by the Assessing Officer. 2.1
Assessing Officer noted in the assessment order that M/s Halliburton Export
Inc., (hereinafter referred to as the assessee) is a company incorporated in
the USA and is engaged in the business of supplying pre- packaged software and
providing maintenance and other support services associated with it. The
assessee has entered into agreements with various customers in India for
rendering the above services. 2.2 The Assessing Officer further noted that
assessee is a tax resident of USA and it has filed a tax return relying on the
provisions of DTAA between India and USA. In the return of income, assessee
has claimed that it does not have a permanent establishment in India in terms
of Article 5 of the India US DTAA and accordingly, the income received from
the aforesaid supply/maintenance of software is not taxable in India. During
the assessment proceedings a letter was written by the Assessing Officer on
9.12.2010 stating therein that assessee has received a gross amount of Rs.
6,03,64,143/- for sale and maintenance of software from its Indian customers
in relation the agreements entered into by it. During the course of assessment
proceedings, assessee was asked to show cause as to why receipt in sale of
software should not be regarded as royalty and receipt in lieu of provision of
maintenance services associated with it should not be regarded as royalty/fee
3 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 for technical services in terms of the provisions
of Income Tax read with article 12 of the Indian US DTAA and taxed
accordingly. 2.3 Assessee filed reply in response to above show cause notice
and while elaborately discussing requisite of section 9(1)(vi) of the Act and
also article 12 of the DTAA and relying upon various case law as noted by the
Assessing Officer, it was observed that receipt from sale of software cannot
be construed as income in the nature of royalty and thus concluded as under:-
> "Therefore, in view of the facts and the circumstances above, and in the
> light of the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Gracemac, the
> consideration received by the assessee is taxable as royalty within the
> meaning of Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi) of the Act and under the Double
> Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and USA. Considerations received
> as a result of maintenance of software are also taxable as royalty as these
> are the services in connection with the activities with respect to the
> transfer of rights including the granting of a license.
> As per section 115(1)(b)(A), (AA) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (1) Where the
> total income of -

> the agreement is in accordance with that policy, then, subject to the

> aggregate of,-
> (A)the amount of income-tax calculated on the income by way of royalty, if
> any, included in the total income, at the rate of thirty per cent if such
> royalty is received in pursuance of an agreement made on  4 I.T.A. Nos.5209
> /DEL/2011 or before the 31st day of May, 1997 and twenty per cent where such
> royalty is received in pursuance of an agreement made after the 31st day of

> (AA)the amount of income-tax calculated on the income by way of royalty, if
> any, included in the total income, at the rate of ten per cent if such
> royalty is received in pursuance of an agreement made on or after 1st day of
> June, 2005:) Since the date of the agreements are not verifiable from the
> agreements, so, in order to safeguard the interest of revenue, the gross
> amount of `6,03,54,143/- received by the assessee is held to be taxable as
> royalty at the rate of 15%."
2.3.1 Draft order in this case was passed on 24.12.2010 in which income was
proposed to be assessed at Rs.6,03,54,143/-. Subsequently, an order dated
18.01.2011 u/s 154/144C(1) of the Act was passed wherein the income was
computed at Rs.11,08,72,926/-. On receipt of the draft order, the assessee
filed its objections with the DRP. The order of the DRP was received in this
office on 28.09.2011, in which no adverse inference was drawn and the
variations made by the assessee ewer confirmed. Therefore, in view of the
above, the taxable income of the assessee is computed as under:
Particulars Amount (Rs.) Gross amount received by the assessee company
11,08,72,926 as Royalty Total income rounded off 11,08,72,930 Income tax
payable @ 15% 1,66,30,940 Hence, the income of the assessee is assessed at
RS.11,.08,72,930/-. Charge Interest u/s 234A, 234B and 234C as applicable.
5 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
2.4 Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, assessee has come up in
appeal and raised following grounds:-
> "1.That the Assessing Officer has erred on facts and in law in holding that
> the payments received by the appellant from sale of software and provision
> of maintenance and other support services to customers in India, were
> taxable as "Royalty", in terms of section 9(1)(vi) of the Income-tax Act,
> 1961 (the "Act") as well as Article 12 of the India- US Double Taxation
> Avoidance Agreement ("DTAA"). 1.1 On the facts and circumstances of the
> case, the Assessing Officer failed to appreciate that sale of software and
> provision of maintenance/other support services by the appellant has not
> resulted in transfer of any rights in relation to a 'copyright' embedded in
> the said software and, therefore, the payments, received by the appellant do
> not constitute 'royalty' either in terms of the Act or the DTAA. 1.2 The
> Assessing Officer has erred in law and on facts in applying the tax rate of
> 15% to the receipts of the appellant, in terms of the DTAA, as against the
> tax rate of 10 percent under the Act, being more favourable to the appellant
> alleging that the appellant failed to substantiate that the relevant
> agreements with the customers with entered into on or after 1st June, 2005."
> 2\. That the Assessing Officer, while holding as above, has failed to
> appreciate that the payments received by the appellant constitute business
> profits and cannot be brought to tax in India, as per provisions of Article
> 7 (read with Article 5) of the DTAA, in absence of a permanent establishment
> in India.
> 3\. That the Assessing Officer has erred in charging interest u/s 234B of
> the Act.
> The appellant craves leave to add, alter, vary, omit, substitute or amend
> the above grounds of appeal and/or the relief claimed, at any time before or
> at the time of hearing of the appeal, so as to enable the Tribunal to decide
> this appeal according to law."
2.5 As regards ground No.1, 1.1 and 2 are concerned, same relate to sale of
software and maintenance services and learned counsel for the assessee while
reiterating the submission as made before the Assessing Officer has laid
stress on the following, out of earlier submissions and submitted that:
6 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
"Halliburton Export Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the 'assessee") is
engaged in the business of supplying pre-packaged software and providing
maintenance/support services associated with it. As per the agreements entered
into between the assessee and its customer, the assessee grants to its
customers (the end-users) a non- exclusive and non-transferable license to use
the software for the purpose of its business. The mode of use of the license
by the customers has been mutually agreed upon between the parties under the
above contracts. It is pertinent to mention that the copyright in the software
licensed to the customers shall, at all times, vest with the assessee.
Further, all support services related to the use of the software are provided
remotely and no personnel of the assessee visit India.
In view of the above factual background, the taxability of the income of the
assessee in India is discussed in the following paragraphs"
Relevant provisions of the Act The taxability or otherwise, of the income of
the assessee in India as per the Act is governed by the provisions of section
5 read with section 9(1) of the Act.
Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi) defines "royalty" to include any
consideration for transfer of all or any rights in respect of any copyright,
literary, artistic or scientific work. The expression 'copyright' is not
defined in the Act it musty be understood in accordance with the law governing
copyright in India, i.e. the Copyright Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as
the "ICA"). In terms of the ICA, a copyright subsists in literary work, which
includes computer programme.
It is submitted that only those payments in relation to supply of software,
which result in transfer of any rights in relation to a copyright, can be said
to be taxable as royalty under the provisions of the Act.
Relevant provisions of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement.
In terms of the provisions of India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement
(hereinafter referred to as the "DTAA" or the "Tax Treaty"), the income of the
assessee may be taxed in India in either of the following ways:
• As royalty under Article 12 or  7 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 • As business
profits under Article 7 (read with Article 5) Article 12 defines royalty to
include consideration received for the use of, or the right to use, any
copyright or a literary, artistic, or scientific work. A plain reading of the
definition shows that when the assessee transfers the rights over a copyright,
the same shall be said to be in the nature of royalty.
In case the income of the assessee is not in the nature of royalty, then the
same may be taxed under Article 7 as business income if the assessee has a
Permanent Establishment (hereinafter referred to as the "PE") in India and the
above income is attributable to such PE.
The income of the assessee is not in the nature of "Royalty"
As submitted above, the requisite condition for any payment in relation to
supply of software to be classified a royalty-both in terms of the Act and the
DTAA, it is necessary that the right in relation to the 'copyright' and not
the 'copyrighted article' must be transferred. Your good self would appreciate
that, passing on a right to use and facilitating the use of a product for
which the assessee has a copyright is not the same thing as transferring or
assigning rights in relation to the copyright. The enjoyment of some or all
the rights of a copyright is necessary to trigger the royalty. However, non-
exclusive and non- transferable license enabling the use of a copyrighted
product cannot be construed as an authority to enjoy any or all of them
enumerated rights ingrained in a copyright. Rather such a transfer of software
license tantamount to sale of 'copyrighted article' as laid down by the Apex
Court in the case of Tata Consultancy Services V. State of Andhra Pradesh
(2004) 271 ITR 401.
Reliance in this regard may also be placed on the Authority for Advance Ruling
decision in the case of Dassault Systems K.K. vs. DIT 322 ITR 125 wherein it
has been emphasized that the right to download and store a computer programme
for internal business purpose is use of the copyrighted product and payments
made in this regard cannot be considered as 'royalties' taxable under the
provisions of the Act or under the tax treaty. Accordingly, the Authority held
that payments received from sale of licensed software would be characterized
as 'business profits', which in the absence of PE shall not be taxable in
India.
8 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
In the present case, the purpose of the license or the transaction is only to
establish access to the copyrighted product for internal business purpose.
Thus it cannot be said that the copyright itself has been transferred to any
extent. It does not make any difference even if the computer programme passed
on to the use is a highly specialized one. The parting of intellectual
property rights, inherent in and attached to the software product, in favour
of the licensee/ customer is mandatory requirement by the Act and the tax
treaty to consider it as 'royalty'.
Accordingly, merely authorizing or enabling a customer to have the benefit of
the instructions/ programme contained therein without any further right to
deal with them independently does not amount to transfer of rights in relation
to copyright or conferment of the right of using the copyright.
Your good self would appreciate that the principle that the payments from sale
of licensed software, being sale of a copyrighted article, cannot be regarded
as 'royalty' has been time and again emphasized by various Courts. An
illustrative list of such cases is given below:
> •Motorola Inc. v. DCIT (2005) 95 ITD 269 (SB) •DDIT v. Alcatel USA
> International Marketing Inc. (2009-
> +ITOL-733-ITAT-MUM) •Infrasoft Limited v. ADIT (2009) 28 SOT 179 (Del)
> •Lucent Technologies Hindustan Ltd. v. ITO (2009) 28 SOT 98 (Del) •Rational
> Software Corpn. (India) Ltd. v. ITO ITA Nos. 608 to 610/Bang/2008 •Sonata
> Information Technology Ltd. v. ACIT (2006) 103 ITD 324 (Bang) •Hewlett-
> Packard (India) (P) Ltd. v. ITO (2006) 5 SOT 660 (Bang) •Wipro Ltd. v. DCIT
> (2006) 5 SOT 508 (Bang) •FactSet Research Systems Inc. (2009) 317 ITR 169
> (AAR) In view of the above, it is submitted that the receipts of the
> assessee are not in the nature of royalty and are not taxable as per the
> provisions of the Act as well as the DTAA.
The income of the assessee is not in the nature of 'Business Profits'  9
I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 As submitted above, the receipts in relation to use
of a copyright shall constitute business profits and can be brought to tax in
India only in cases where the assessee has a Permanent Establishment
(hereinafter referred to as the "PE" ) in the country.
It is further submitted that the assessee does not have any business presence
in India and all services in relation to supply and/or maintenance of pre-
packaged software are rendered outside India. Thus the assessee cannot be said
to be having a PE in India.
"In the present case, the assessee has entered into agreements with its
customers for supplying pre-packed software. As per terms of the said
agreements, the assessee grants to its customers (the end-users) a non-
exclusive and non-transferable license to use the software for the purpose of
their business. The mode of use of the license by the customer has been
mutually agreed upon between the parties under the above agreements.
"Royalty is defined under Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi) of the Act, to
include any consideration for transfer of all or any rights in respect of
copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work. For the purpose of this
discussion, it is relevant to consider whether the sale of software by
assessee amount to transfer of any 'copyright' so as to be taxable as
'royalty'.
Copyright has not been defined under the Act and thus, the definition provided
under the law governing copyright in India i.e. the Copyright Act, 1957 (the
"ICA") may be referred. In terms of the ICA, computer programme is considered
as a literary work and is a subject matter of copyright.
Royalty has been defined in a similar manner under Article 13 of the DTAA to
include consideration received for the use of, or the right to use, any
copyright or a literary, artistic, or scientific work. From the above, it may
be inferred that the requisite condition for any payment in relation to supply
of software to be classified as royalty- both in terms of the Act and the
DTAA, is that the rights in relation to the 'copyright' and not the
'copyrighted article' must be transferred. Rights in relation to a copyright
would include right to reproduce work, issue copies to public, etc. In other
words, when the assessee transfers only the rights over the use of copyright,
the same cannot be said to be in the nature of royalty.
10 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
Reference in this respect may be drawn form Apex Court decision in the case of
Tata Consultancy Services vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (2004) 271 ITR 401
wherein it has been held that transfer of software license tantamount to sale
of 'copyrighted article' which would be subject to Sales Tax. In this landmark
judgement, the Court has observed that non-exclusive and non-transferable
license enabling the use of a copyrighted product cannot be construed as an
authority to enjoy any or all of the enumerated rights ingrained in a
copyright. Hence passing on a right to use and facilitating the use of a
product for which the assessee has a copyright is not the same thing as
transferring or assigning rights in relation to the copyright.
Your kind attention is also invited to the decision of Authority for Advance
Ruling in the case of Dassault Systems KK vs. DIT 322 ITR 125 wherein it has
been emphasized that the right to download and store a computer programme for
internal business purpose is use of the copyrighted product and payments made
in this regard cannot be considered as 'royalties' taxable under the
provisions of the Act or under the tax treaty.
Similar views have been expressed time and again by various Courts. An
illustrative lit of such cases is given below:
> •Motorola Inc. v. DCIT (2005) 95 ITD 269 (SB) •DDIT v. Alcatel USA
> International Marketing Inc. (2009- ITOL-733-ITAT-MUM) •Infrasoft Limited v.
> ADIT (2009) 28 SOT 179 (Del) •Lucent Technologies Hindustan Ltd. v. ITO
> (2009) 28 SOT 98 (Del) •Rational Software Corpn. (India) Ltd. v. ITO ITA
> Nos. 608 to 610/Bang/2008 •Sonata Information Technology Ltd. v. ACIT (2006)
> 103 ITD 324 (Bang) •Hewlett-Packard (India) (P) Ltd. v. ITO (2006) 5 SOT 660
> (Bang) •Wipro Ltd. v. DCIT (2006) 5 SOT 508 (Bang) •FactSet Research Systems
> Inc. (2009) 317 ITR 169 (AAR)"
" Since the assessee merely authorizes or enables a customer to have the
benefit of the software without any further right to deal with it
independently, sale of the same cannot amount to transfer of rights in  11
I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 relation to copyright or conferment of the right of
using the copyright. Accordingly, receipts from sale of software cannot be
construed as income in nature of royalty.
In view of the above, the receipts from sale of software shall constitute
business profits and can be brought to tax in India only in cases where the
assessee has a PE in the country.
In this regard, it is submitted that the assessee does not have any business
presence in India and all services in relation to supply and/or maintenance of
pre-packaged software are rendered outside India. Accordingly, the assessee
cannot be said to be having a PE in India and receipts from sale of software
are not taxable as per the provisions of the Act as well as the DTAA."
"In the facts of the instant case, the assessee provides maintenance services
in relation to the pre-packaged software supplied by it. Provision of these
services primarily involves utilization of technical know-how/ skill, etc.
during the process of rendering of services and no knowledge or skill for
further use of the customer is provided. Therefore it cannot be said that any
technical knowhow or skill has been made available to the customer.
In view of the above factual and legal position, it can be said that receipts
in relation to provision of maintenance and other services in relation to
software supplied shall not be in nature FIS in terms of the DTAA. These shall
be in nature of business profits, which can be brought to tax in India only in
cases where the assessee has a PE in India. As submitted before, the assessee
does not have any PE in India and accordingly, the receipts from provision of
ancillary services in relation to supply of software are not taxable in India"
2.6 It was further submitted that the title remains with the assessee all the
time and it has only to be used for internal purpose. Relying upon Motorala's
case reported in 95 ITD 269 (SB) and Erricson's case as reported in 343 ITR
470 (Delhi) and relevant provisions of Software Maintenance Agreement,
further, reliance was placed on the case of Infrasoft Ltd. Vs ADIT as reported
in 125 TTJ 53 (Delhi), objections filed before DRP, it was pleaded that the
receipts from provisions of ancillary in relation of supply of  12 I.T.A.
Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 software are not taxable in India. Therefore, order of the
AO needs to be reversed by allowing the appeal. It was, thus, pleaded for
accepting the plea of the assessee to delete the addition made.
2.7 Ld. DR while supporting the order of AO has strongly pleaded that there
was a transfer of right to use when ownership of the copyright has not been
transferred and simply use has been allowed and for that ld. DR referred to
clause 6.1 of agreement and further submitted that period of license was for
one year as per clause 6.3 and clause 7 and 7.1 deals with termination and
since software was not sold but license was to be used and use of copyright is
embedded therein. So, software has been given for use. Its license only cannot
said to be a transfer. Men have come to India, it was composite contract, and
software component was not separable. Nokia's case of Delhi High Court is not
applicable. Karnataka High Court in the case of CIT vs. Sun Computer is
directly applicable to the facts of the case and reference was also made in
the case of Citric Systems Asia Pacific Pvt. Ltd. reported in 2012-TII-04-ARA-
INTL AAR No. 822 dated 06.02.2012. So it was pleaded for confirmation of the
impugned order. 2.7.1 Reliance placed on various decisions by the Ld. A.R. for
the assessee has been distinguished by Ld. D.R. as under:
> (i) DIT vs. Ericsson AB, (Delhi):- It has been argued by the AR that the tax
> payer's case is covered by the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
> Court. As submitted at the time of hearing before the Hon'ble Bench the
> Ericsson's case is distinguishable on facts. At the time of hearing
> reference was made to paragraphs 54 to 61 (page 15 to 17) of the decision
> wherefrom it can be seen that the major thrust of the decision was on the
> fact that the software that was loaded on the hardware did not have any
> independent existence and no separate payment was agreed for it: On these
> facts it was held by the High Court that the payment for software was not
> royalty.
13 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
> In the present case the software is not embedded in any hardware. The
> assessee has supplied the software on standalone basis. Also, as submitted
> in detail at the time of hearing, there is no sale of software and only
> license was given to use it. The software had to be returned to the taxpayer
> after the expiry of the license which was normally for one year. Thus,
> .there was -no sale of any copyrighted article.
> (ii) Nokia Networks: In the aforesaid case the Delhi High Court has given
> the decision vide order dated-·07-09-2012. The issue regarding taxability of
> payment for software has been discussed in para 23 to 30 (page 26-4;0 36) of
> the decision. As-the facts of the aforesaid case were exactly similar to
> that of Ericsson's case the High Court-has followed the Ericsson's decision.
> (iii) Infrasoft ltd. vs. ADIT, ITAT, Delhi: The aforesaid decision is
> primarily based on the special bench decision of the ITAT in the case of
> Motorola and ITAT, Bangalore's decision in the case of Samsung Electronics (
> para 43 to 46, page 16 & 17). Since subsequently High Courts' decisions have
> come both in the case of Motorola (viz. Ericsson and Nokia ) and Samsung

2.7.2 Decisions relied upon by the Revenue:-
(j) Samsung Electronics ltd. { Karnataka High CourtU2011- TII-43-
HC-KAR-INTLl:... The High Court in para 15 ( page 39) has referred to Supreme
Court's decision the case of Sun Engineering Works to reiterate the settled
position of law that a decision is in authority for what it decides. In para
19 (page 43) the High Court has held that a literary work is entitled to
copyright and computer software has been recognised as a copyright work in
India. In para 20 ( page 44) after referring to the terms of-the software
licence agreement the High Court has held that what is transferred is only a
licence to use the  14 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 copyright belonging to the
supplier and the supplier continues to be the owner of the copyright and all
other IPRs. The High Court did not accept ,the contention of the tax payer
that there is no transfer of copyright or any part thereof.
In para 21 and 22 the High Court has considered the issue as to whether the
software is to be treated as goods and whether there is sale of the software.
The Supreme Court's decision in the case of TCS has also been-discussed. The
High Court has held that the aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court is not
applicable as the question whether the payment made for supply of software was
royalty or not was not at all the issue in TCS case. The Court held that the
aforesaid decision would not preclude it from holding that the payment
received by the supplier would amount to royalty unless it is proved that the
payment is for the sale of software.
In para 23 (page 45) the High Court had referred to the definition of
copyright under the Copyright Act, 1957 wherein it is clearly stated that
'literary work' includes computer programmes etc. In para 24 ( page 47)the
High Court after referring to section 51 and 52 of the Copyright Act has held
that licence is granted for taking copy of software and to store it in the
hard disk and to take a backup copy and right to make and-copy itself is a
part of the copyright. The High Court further held that when licence to make
use of the software by making copy of the same and to store it to the hard
disk is given then what is transferred is right to use the software, an
exclusive right, which the owner of copyright owns and what is transferred is
only right to use copy of the software. The High Court thus did not accept the
taxpayer's contention that there was no transfer of any part of copyright or
copyright under the agreements or licences. The High Court held that right to
make a copy of the software and use it for internal business itself amounts to
copyright work u/s. 14(1) of the copyright act. According to the High Court
what s granted under the licence is only right to copy of the software and
there is no sale involved in the transactions. The1iigh Court held-that amount
paid to the supplier for the supply of shrink wrapped software was not the
price of the CD alone or software alone nor the price of licence granted. This
is combination of all: In the aforesaid para the High Court has also
highlighted the difference between the computer software and copyright in
respect of books etc. In para 25 (page 48) the High Court has concluded that
payment for supply of software would constitute royalty within the meaning of
the  15 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011 D~ and under the I.T. Act as the right that
is transferred in such a case is transfer of copyright. The High Court has
also held that the payment would constitute royalty for imparting of -any
information ·concerning technical; industrial,' commercial or scientific
knowledge, experience or skill.
Before the High Court the taxpayer. had referred to the DECO commentary,
observation of, Klaus Vogel , the decision of AAR in the case of Dassault
Systems and Geoquest System, sale of copyrighted article (para 6 to 9).
(ii) Sunray Computers Ltd: & Lucent Technology ( ITA Nos. 756/2006 { Karnataka
High Court dated 21st Oct., 2011: In this case the taxpayer had imported
computer software ih India. T-he ~assessee had also imported hardware
separately. It integrated the software and hardware and supplied the same to
telecommunication department ( para 5,Page 9). The ITAT held that the payment
for software was not royalty as the assessee had not acquired rights in the
copyright programme and hence the same could not be exploited commercially
(para 7,Page 10). The High Court held that since supply of software was an
independent transaction the payment for it amounted to royalty ( para 10-11,
page 12).
(iii) Citrix Systems Asia (2012-TII-04-ARA-INTL.: This decision of the AAR
also pertains to the payment for supply of shrink wrapped software. In para 1
& 6 (page 8 & 9) the terms of agreement are mentioned. In paragraph 10 to 12 (
Page 10) the submissions of the tax payers, reference to DECO commentary,
distinction between copyright and copyrighted article, etc. are mentioned. In
para 15 to 17 ( page 11 & 12) the AAR has discussed the various provisions of
the Copyright Act. In para. 18 page 12 the AAR has stated that use of a
copyright either by a owner or a licensee would not be an infringement of a
copyright. The transfer of ownership can be by an assignment of the copyright
either wholly or partially. A licence can be granted by the owner of copyright
of any .interest in the right. The AAR has held that when a licensee acquires
a computer programme he also gets the right to use that programme to a limited
extent. He also gets the right, absolute or limited to use the copyright.
In para 19 .( page 13) the AAR has held that when a software is created by a
person who acquires a copyright for it, he becomes the owner of that copyright
and he can transfer or licence that right.
16 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
While selling or licensing the software the owner is also selling or licensing
the right to use the copy right embedded therein. It was further held that
software is a literary work and copyright of the creator over the software is
an important and commercially valuable right and therefore whenever a software
is assigned or licensed for use, there is an assignment of the right to use
the embedded copyright in the software or a license to use the embedded
copyright. The AAR thus held that it is not possible to divorce the software
from the IPR of the creator of the software embedded therein.
In Para 21 ( page 13) the AAR has held that sale or licensing of a software
for use passes to the grantee a copyright as defined in section 14 of the
Copyright Act. In para 22 ( page 13) after holding that license is not
confined to an exclusive license, the AAR has held that where a software is
acquired the licensee or purchaser gets the right to use it without being held
guilty of infringement of the copyright The AAR has held that sale or
licensing of the software involves the grant of a right to use the copyright
embedded in the software. The Authority thus did not accept the taxpayer's
argument that licensing of the software is the mere sale of a copyrighted
article and does not involve the grant of a right to use the copyright in the
software.
In para 23 to 27 ( page 14 & 15) and para 43 ( page 17) the AAR referred to
the decisions in the case Factset System, M/s. Dassault, Geoquest and TCS and
has disagreed/distinguished the decisions. The Authority has held that
whenever a software is transferred or license for used, it takes within it the
copyright embedded in the software and the one cannot be divorced from the
other.
In paragraph 32 (page 16) the AR has held that the distinction between
copyright and copyrighted article is illusory as when a copyrighted article is
permitted or licensed the permission involves not only the physical or
electronic manifestation of a programme, but also the use of or the right to
use the copyright embedded therein. In para 39 (page 17) the AAR has
reiterated that the sale or license for use of a copyright software amounts to
or amounts also to the grant of a right to use of a copyright.
In para 42 & 43 ( page 17) the AAR has held that payment for supply of
software would be royalty both under the I.T.Act and under the DTAA."
17 I.T.A. Nos.5209 /DEL/2011
2.8 In order to counter the submission of ld. DR, ld. Counsel for the assessee
submitted that this is not sale of software by any company and there is
termination clause and TCS needs to be applied and it is a case where
copyrighted article is transferred and not copyright as admitted by the DR. No
person visited India and reference was made to Paper book Page 156, 157, 181
and 182. It was submitted that only plan was transferred but nobody visited
India and assessee has entered into separate agreement. Under the treaty,
assessee is liable to be taxed.
2.9 This case was earlier heard and draft order was prepared and discussed by
both the members but fresh development after latest decision on the subject
has come to the notice of the members of the Bench. So, the case was refixed
for clarification and the same was heard again. Ld. Counsel for the assessee
submitted that the issue raised in this appeal is now squarely covered by the
latest decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of DIT Vs Infrasoft
Ltd. dated Nov. 22, 2013 and reported in 2013-TII- 15-HC -DEL-INTL, is in
favour of the assessee, a copy of which oder has been filed and it was pleaded
that such issue is no longer res-integra as the same is covered by
Jurisdictional High Court decision, therefore, it should be decided in favour
of the assessee by accepting its appeal.
3\. Ld. D.R. while submitting that similar issue was dealt by ITAT Mumbai
Bench 'L', Mumbai in group of cases DDIT (IT)-2(1) Vs Reliance Infocom Ltd and
others dated 06th Sep., 2013 but since the issue is squarely covered in favour
of the assessee by Jurisdictional High Court Decision so, such precedent of a
Tribunal losses its importance and the precedent of  18 I.T.A. Nos.5209
/DEL/2011 Jurisdictional High Court will prevail, therefore the matter can be
decided accordingly.
4\. We have heard both the sides, considered the material on record as well as
the precedent already relied upon at the time of original hearing and Mumbai
Bench Decision in group of cases DDIT(IT)-2(1) vs Reliance Infocom Ltd. and
others (supra) and Jurisdictional High Court decision in the case of DIT Vs
Infrasoft Ltd. (supra) cited by the Department and Ld. counsel for the
assessee respectively at the time of fresh hearing, we find that since the
issue is covered in favour of the assessee as contended by the Ld. A.R. and
the same was not disputed by the Ld. D.R., therefore, following the
Jurisdictional High Court's decision, we decide the issue in favour of the
assessee and allow the appeal of the assessee on this issue and direct to
delete the impugned addition made for sale of software and provisions of
maintenance / other support services to the customers in India being not
taxable.
4.1 As regards charging of interest u/s 234B of the Act is concerned, the same
is consequential but since the addition as made by the A.O. has already been
deleted by us, therefore, question of charging of interest does not arise
which is directed to be deleted.
5\. As a result the appeal of the assessee gets accepted.
