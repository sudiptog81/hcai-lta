difference in functional comparability can be eliminated. By not resorting to
such a process of making adjustment, the Page 36 of 36 36 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
TPO has rendered this company as not qualifying for comparability. We,
therefore, accept the plea of the assessee in this regard."
Concurring with the findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai Bench (supra) and also the
appellant's vehement objection in choosing Celestial Labs Limited as
comparable, we are of the considered view that this issue also requires a
fresh look at the TPO's level. To facilitate the TPO to comply with the
directions of this Bench (supra), we remit back this issue also to the file of
the TPO.
8\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed as
indicated above.
Order pronounced in the open court on 16th day of March, 2012.

PER GEORGE GEORGE K :
This appeal of the assessee company is directed against the assessment
completed under section 143(3) rws 144C of the I T Act. The relevant
assessment year is 2007-08. The assessee is aggrieved by the order of the
Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) dated 16th August, 2011. The DRP has issued
directions under section 144C(5) rws 144C(8). The DRP has approved the Draft
Order of Assessment making transfer pricing adjustment as suggested by the
Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) under section 92CA of the Act.

2\. The assessee has raised the following grounds:-
> 1) The order of the learned Assessing Officer and directions of the Hon'ble
> DRP are based on incorrect interpretation of law and therefore are bad in
> law.
> 2) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
> the directions of DRP, the learned Assessing Officer erred in assessing the
> total income at Rs.3,25,93,235/- as against returned income of
> Rs.13,60,601/- computed by the appellant.
> 3) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
> the directions of Hon'ble DRP, the learned AO erred in disallowing the
> software expenses amounting to Rs. 22,94,928 incurred by the Appellant
> towards annual software license fees which was charged off as software
> expenses to the Profit and Loss account as it does not result in any
> enduring benefit to the company.
> 4) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
> the directions of Hon'ble DRP, the learned AO erred in disallowing the
> foreign exchange loss amounting to Rs.63,30,156 incurred by the Appellant on
> restatement of export proceeds, import payables, travelling expenses, etc.,
> which is revenue in nature and which has arisen in the normal course of
> business.
5) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
the directions of Hon'ble DRP, the learned AO erred in holding that the
telecommunication expenses amounting to Rs.8,69,205 is attributable to the
delivery of computer software outside India should be reduced from export
turnover while computing the deduction under Section 1OA of the Act and
6) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
the directions of Hon'ble DRP, the learned AO erred in holding that travel
expenses amount to Page 3 of 36 3 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 Rs. 1,24,78,9 19
incurred in foreign currency is for providing technical services and hence
should be reduced from export turnover while computing the deduction u/s 1OA
of the Act.
7) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law and based on
the directions of Hon'ble DRP, the learned AO erred in law by not considering
the alternative plea of the Appellant that, if the telecommunication expenses
attributable to the delivery of computer software outside India and travel
expenses incurred in foreign currency are reduced from export turnover, an
equal amount should also be reduced from total turnover for computing the
deduction u/s 1OA of the Act.
Transfer Pricing Adjustment On the facts and in the circumstances of the case
and in law:
8) The learned AO / Transfer Pricing Officer ("TPO") erred in making an
addition of Rs. 25,423,419 and Rs. 3,962,020, to the total income of the
Appellant on account of adjustment in the arm's length price of the software
development and related services and customer support services transactions
entered by the Appellant with its associated enterprise.
9) The learned AO/TPO erred in disregarding the economic analysis undertaken
by the Appellant without proper justification and conducting a fresh economic
analysis for the determination of the arm's length price in connection with
the impugned international transactions and holding that the Appellant's
international transactions are not at arm's length.
10) The learned AO / TPO have erred in ignoring the fact that since that
Appellant is availing tax holiday u/s 1OA of the Act, there is no intention to
shift the profit base out of India, which is one of the basic intentions of
the introduction of transfer pricing provisions.
Page 4 of 36 4 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
11) The learned AO / TPO erred in determining the arm's length margin/price
using only financial year 2006-07 data, which was not available to the
Appellant at the time of complying with the transfer pricing documentation
requirements.
12) The learned Assessing Officer/TPO erred in rejecting certain comparables
considered by the Appellant in the comparability analysis by applying
different quantitative and qualitative filters:
a. the learned AO / TPO erred in rejecting certain comparable companies
identified by the Appellant using turnover < Rs. 1 Crore as a comparability
criterion; and b. the learned Assessing Officer/TPO erred in rejecting certain
comparable companies identified by the Appellant as having economic
performance contrary to the industry behavior (e.g. companies which showed a
diminishing revenue trend); and
13) The learned TPO erred in obtaining information which was not available in
public domain by exercising powers u/s 133(6) of the Act and relying on the
information for comparability analysis.
14) The learned AO / TPO erred in not considering the foreign exchange
fluctuation gain (loss) as part of the operating income while computing the
operating margin.
15) The learned AO / TPO erred in not making suitable adjustments on account
of differences in the risk profile of the Appellant vis-a-vis the comparables,
while conducting comparability analysis.
16) The learned AO/TPO erred in computing the arm's length price without
giving benefit of +/- 5 percent under the proviso to section 92C of the Act.
Page 5 of 36 5 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
17) The learned TPO has erred by performing a fresh search using both Prowess
and Capitaline databases. Transaction specific grounds of appeal relating to
transfer pricing - Software development and related services transaction
18) The learned AO / TPO erred by accepting! rejecting certain companies based
on unreasonable comparability criteria.
19) The learned AO / TPO erred in rejecting certain comparables identified by
the Appellant using 'onsite revenues greater than 75% of the export revenues'
as a comparability criterion.
20) The learned AO / TPO erred in wrongly computing the operating margins of
some of the comparable companies. Transaction specific grounds of appeal
relating to transfer pricing-Customer support services transaction
21) The learned AO / TPO erred by accepting/rejecting certain companies based
on unreasonable comparability criteria.
Common grounds of appeal relating to corporate tax and transfer pricing
matters
22) The learned AO erred in levying interest of Rs.56,08,016 and Rs. 15,662/-
u/s 234B and 234D of the Act respectively.
23) The learned AO erred, in law and in facts, in initiating penalty
proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act.
3\. Ground nos. 1, 2 and 8 are general in nature and no specific adjudication
is called for. Hence, these grounds are dismissed.
Page 6 of 36 6 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 3.1. Ground Nos.22 and 23 is consequential
and hence, these grounds are also rejected.
3.2. Ground nos.3 to 7 mentioned above relates to the corporate tax matters.
Ground Nos.9 to 21 relates to transfer pricing adjustment. We shall consider
the grounds chronologically. Corporate Tax Matters
4\. Ground No.3 : Software Expenses Debited to P&L Account During the previous
year relevant to the concerned asst. year, the assessee company had debited to
the P&L account an amount of Rs.22,94,928/- as software expenses. The details
of the same are as follows:-
i) Annual Software licence fee Rs. 19,29,480
ii) Software Purchase Rs. 3,65,511 The assessee submitted that the software
expenses charged to the P&L account largely represent expenses incurred
towards annual software licence fee which are in the nature of annual
maintenance charges (AMC) and purchase of other application software. It was
submitted before the Assessing Officer that by incurring these expenses, there
was no enduring benefit to the assessee and the same is allowable expenditure
under section 37 of the Act. The Assessing Officer however disallowed the
software expenses of Rs.22,94,928/- paid towards the purchase of application
software and annual licence fee, considering the same to be capital in nature.
The Assessing Officer held that since the assessee has used the words Page 7
of 36 7 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 "software worth Rs.3,65,511/- has been
purchased", it has been definitely brought in enduring benefit in perpetuity
and hence, the same is to be capitalized. Further, the Assessing Officer held
that the remaining part of the software expenditure amounting to
Rs.19,29,418/- was expended to obtain continuous uninterrupted usage of the
software and hence, it is nothing but an enduring benefit obtained by the
assessee. 4.1 Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us. 4.2 It was
submitted that the said expenditure is an allowable expenditure under section
37 of the Act on account of the following reasons:-
> • These expenses were incurred for acquiring licensed software in the nature
> of application software purchased/licensed from various vendors which grants
> permission to use software only for a period of one year. Since, the
> expenses were incurred for renewing the license of the software for a period
> of only one year (and do not have an indefinite period of life), these were
> treated as revenue expenditure and charged to profit and loss account.
> • The software technology is undergoing rapid changes, and new and improved
> software is launched in the market every day, rendering software obsolete
> within a short time-frame. Given that the original software purchased
> becomes redundant very quickly; this necessitates recurring expenditure to
> be incurred by Kodiak India on constant up gradation of the same.
> • Wherever the software purchased by Kodiak India results in enduring
> benefit, such software have been capitalized by Kodiak India and only the
> depreciation is being claimed on a year on year basis.
The assessee also relied on the following judgements of various High Courts
and the orders of various Tribunals:-
Page 8 of 36 8 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 • Amway India Enterprises v DCIT (301 ITR
(AT) 1) (Del.); • CIT v M/s Raychem RPG Limited (Bom.);
• Bank of Punjab Ltd. v JCIT (2002) 122 Taxman Mag 235) (Chandigarh ITAT);
• Mohd Ishaque,Mohd Gulam (1994) (210 ITR 817) (MP); • JCIT v Citicorp
Overseas Softwares Ltd. (2004) 85 TTJ 87 (Mum. ITAT);
• Lubi Electricals Pvt. Ltd. v DCIT (Ahm.) (ITA No.163 /Ahd/1992); • Business
Information Processing Limited v ACIT (Ahm.) (ITA No.163/Ahd/1992);
• Media Video Ltd. v JCIT (2002) 122 Taxman (Mag.) 28 (Del. ITAT); • ACIT v
Jasper Investments Ltd. 109 TTJ 530 (Mum.); • GE Capital Services India v DCIT
106 TTJ 65 (Del.); • CIT(A) v Southern Roadways Limited (2009) 183 Taxman 234
(Chennai); & • IBM India Ltd. v CIT (2006) 290 ITR 183 (Bang.) 4.3 The learned
DR supported the assessment order. 4.4 We have heard the rival submissions and
perused the materials on record. The Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in the
case of CIT v M/s Toyota Kriloskar Motors Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.174/2009 dated
23rd March, 2011) has considered whether the expenditure in respect of
purchase of software is capital or revenue. The Hon'ble High Court at para 3
of its judgement held as follows :-
> "As rightly pointed out by the authorities, when the life of a computer or
> software is less than two years and as such, the right to use it is for a
> limited period, the fee paid for acquisition of the said right is allowable
> as revenue expenditure and these software if they are licenced for a
> particular period, for utilising the same for the subsequent years fresh
> licence fee is to be paid.
Therefore, without renewing the licence or without paying the fee on such
renewal, it is not possible to use those software. In those circumstances, the
findings recorded by the authorities that the fee paid for Page 9 of 36 9 ITA
No.970/Bang/2011 obtaining the software and the licence and for renewing the
same is to be construed as only revenue expenditure do not call for
interference by this Court.
4.5 The Special Bench in the case of Amway India Enterprises v DCIT (301 ITR
(AT) 1) had laid down various tests to determine whether the expenditure
incurred for purchase of computer software is capital or revenue. In the
instant case, the Assessing Officer did have the benefit of the judgement of
Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT v M/s Toyota Kriloskar
Motors Pvt. Ltd. (supra) when she passed the impugned assessment order. The
Assessing Officer has also not referred to the order of the Special Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of Amway India Enterprises (Supra). The Special Bench
had laid various principles to determine whether the expenditure incurred for
the purchase of a software licence is capital or revenue. The judgement of
Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court and the order of the Special Bench cited
supra are directly applicable to the facts of the instant case. Since the
impugned order of the Assessing Officer did not consider the judgement of the
Hon'ble High Court and the order of the Special Bench, we deem it fit and
proper to restore the matter to the Assessing Officer for an elaborate
discussion on the same. The assessee shall produce the details with reference
to the expenditure incurred and shall cooperate with the Assessing Officer for
expeditious disposal of the matter. It is ordered accordingly. Therefore,
ground nos.3 is allowed for statistical purposes.
Page 10 of 36 10 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
5\. Ground No.4 : Foreign Exchange loss debited to P&L Account During the
assessment year 2007-08, the assessee company had debited the P&L account with
the net foreign exchange loss of Rs.58,40,841/-. The break-up of the same is
as follows:-
Sl. No. Particulars Amount (in Rs.)
1\. Restatement of export sale proceeds, 62,04,206 debtors & bank balances
2\. Travel & other expenses 1,25,950
3\. Trade Imports payable for assets (4,89,314) purchased TOTAL 58,40,841 It
was claimed before the Assessing Officer that the loss debited to the P&L
account is in accordance with Accounting Standard 11 as prescribed by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. It was further submitted that
these were losses arises in the normal course of doing business and therefore,
should be considered as revenue in nature. The Assessing Officer however
disallowed the foreign exchange loss amounting to Rs.63,30,156/- considering
the same to be contingent in nature. 5.1 Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal
before us. 5.2 It was submitted that the foreign exchange loss was on account
of restatement of export sale proceeds, debtors and bank balances and towards
travelling expenses, which have arisen in the normal course of business and
therefore should be considered as revenue in nature. Further it was submitted
that the loss on account of exchange rate fluctuation has been expensed in the
books of accounts during the assessment year 2007-08 as :
     Page 11 of 36                             11                 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
                          i)       Such loss/gain has arisen on trading account,
during the course of business operations and is incidental to the same.
ii) Since Kodiak India is following mercantile system of accounting, exchange
loss incurred by Kodiak India cannot be considered as contingent in nature.
The assessee also placed reliance on the judgement of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of CIT v Woodward Governor India Private Limited (312 ITR 254),
Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd. v CIT (116 ITR 1), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation
Limited v DCIT (261 ITR 1) (Del.) and Sujata Grover (74 TTJ
347) (Del.).
    5.3             The learned DR present was duly heard.
    5.4             We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials
on record. In the case of CIT v Woodward Governor India Private Limited (312
ITR 254), the Hon'ble Supreme Court analysed various issues relating to
treatment of exchange gain/loss arising on account of the increase or decrease
in the value of the foreign currency held on revenue account and upheld the
contentions of assessee that market loss was allowable in the year in which it
was recognized and debited to Profit and Loss Account, in terms of the
mercantile method of accounting followed as per the mandatory Accountant
Standard. In the instant case, the judgement of the Hon'ble Apex Court has not
been considered by the Assessing Officer. Therefore, this issue needs to be
restored to the Assessing Officer for a proper deliberation. Hence, this
matter is restored to the file of the Assessing Officer. She shall decide the
matter in accordance with the provisions of law and as per dictum laid down by
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Page 12 of 36 12 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 the case of
CIT v Woodward Governor India Private Limited (supra). The assessee shall be
afforded a reasonable opportunity of being heard before any decision is
rendered on the matter. It is ordered accordingly. Hence, ground no.4 is
allowed for statistical purposes.
6\. Ground Nos.5,6 & 7 : Re-computation of deduction under section 10A The
assessee in its return of income had claimed deduction under section 10A of
the Act to the tune of Rs.3,42,45,811/-. The Assessing Officer re-computed the
deduction under section 10A of the Act by reducing from the export turnover a
sum of Rs.8,69,205/- being telecommunication expenses and a sum of
Rs.1,24,78,919/- being traveling expenses incurred in foreign currency. The
Assessing Officer however did not reduce the above said expenses from the
total turnover while computing deduction under section 10A of the Act.
6.1 Aggrieved by the re-computation of deduction under section 10A of the Act,
the assessee is in appeal before us. 6.2 It was submitted that the
telecommunication expenses and the expenses incurred in foreign exchange for
travel ought not to be excluded from the export turnover. Alternatively, it
was contended that if the expenses are reduced from the export turnover, the
same ought to be reduced also from the total turnover in the process of
deduction under section 10A of the Act. It was submitted that the assessee's
turnover is exclusively from the exports and hence, the assessee is only
pressing for the alternative ground, namely, ground no.7. It was submitted
that the Page 13 of 36 13 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 alternative submission, namely,
when the expenses are reduced from the export turnover, the same should also
be reduced from the total turnover is covered by the judgement of the Hon'ble
jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT v M/s Tata Elxsi Ltd. & Others
(ITA No. 70 of 2009 dated 30/8/2011), Hon'ble Mumbai High Court in the case of
CIT v Gem Plus Jewellery India Ltd. 330 ITR 175 and the order of the Special
Bench in the case of ITO v M/s Sak Soft Ltd. 313 ITR (AT) 353, in which it has
been held the following :-
> "that the expenses should be reduced not only from export turnover but also
> from the total turnover while computing deduction under section 10A of the
> Act".
6.3 The learned DR unable to controvert the submissions made by the learned
AR.
6.4 We have heard the rival submission and perused the material on record. The
Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of CIT v M/s Tata Elxsi Ltd. & Others
had held that while computing the exemption u/s 10A, if the export turnover in
the numerator is to be arrived at after excluding certain expenses, the same
should also be excluded from the total turnover in the denominator. The
relevant finding of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court reads as follows:-
> "...........Section 10A is enacted as an incentive to exporters to enable
> their products to be competitive in the global market and consequently earn
> precious foreign exchange for the country. This aspect has to be borne in
> mind.
While computing the consideration received from such Page 14 of 36 14 ITA
No.970/Bang/2011 export turnover, the expenses incurred towards freight,
telecommunication charges, or insurance attributable to the delivery of the
articles or things or computer software outside India, or expenses if any
incurred in foreign exchange, in providing the technical services outside
India should not be included. However, the word total turnover is not defined
for the purpose of this section. It is because of this omission to define
'total turnover', the word 'total turnover' falls for interpretation by this
Court;
........In section 10A, not only the word 'total turnover' is not defined,
there is no clue regarding what is to be excluded while arriving at the total
turnover. However, while interpreting the provisions of section 80HHC, the
courts have laid down various principles, which are independent of the
statutory provisions. There should be uniformity in the ingredients of both
the numerator and the denominator of the formula, since otherwise it would
produce anomalies or absurd results. Section 10A is a beneficial section which
intends to provide incentives to promote exports. In the case of combined
business of an assessee, having export business and domestic business, the
legislature intended to have a formula to ascertain the profits from export
business by apportioning the total profits of the business on the basis of
turnovers. Apportionment of profits on the basis of turnover was accepted as a
method of arriving at export profits. In the case of section 80HHC, the export
profit is to be derived from the total business income of the assxcessee,
whereas in section 10-A, the export profit is to be derived from the total
business of the undertaking. Even in the case of business of an undertaking,
it may include export business and domestic business, in other words, export
turnover and domestic turnover. To the extent of export turnover, there would
be a commonality between the numerator and the denominator of the formula. If
the export turnover in the numerator is to Page 15 of 36 15 ITA
No.970/Bang/2011 be arrived at after excluding certain expenses, the same
should also be excluded in computing the export turnover as a component of
total turnover in the denominator. The reason being the total turnover
includes export turnover. The components of the export turnover in the
numerator and the denominator cannot be different. Therefore, though there is
no definition of the term 'total turnover' in section 10A, there is nothing in
the said section to mandate that, what is excluded from the numerator that is
export turnover would nevertheless form part of the denominator. When the
statute prescribed a formula and in the said formula, 'export turnover' is
defined, and when the 'total turnover' includes export turnover, the very same
meaning given to the export turnover by the legislature is to be adopted while
understanding the meaning of the total turnover, when the total turnover
includes export turnover. If what is excluded in computing the export turnover
is included while arriving at the total turnover, when the export turnover is
as a component of total turnover, such an interpretation would run counter to
the legislative intent and impermissible. Thus, there is no error committed by
the Tribunal in following the judgements rendered in the context of section
80HHC in interpreting section 10A when the principle underlying both these
provisions is one and the same".
6.5 The Hon'ble Mumbai High Court in the case of Gem Plus Jewellery India Ltd.
(supra), in identical circumstances, held that since the export turnover forms
part of the total turnover, if an item is excluded from the export turnover,
the same should also be reduced from the total turnover to maintain parity
between numerator and denominator while calculating deduction u/s 10A of the
Act. The relevant finding of the Hon'ble Mumbai High Court reads as follows:-
Page 16 of 36 16 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 "The total turnover of the business
carried on by the undertaking would consist of the turnover from export and
the turnover from local sales. The export turnover constitutes the numerator
in the formula prescribed by sub-section (4). Export turnover also forms a
constituent element of the denominator in as much as the export turnover is a
part of the total turnover. The export turnover, in the numerator must have
the same meaning as the export turnover which is constituent element of the
total turnover in the denominator. The legislature has provided a definition
of the expression "export turnover" in Expln.2 to s.10A which the expression
is defined to mean the consideration in respect of export by the undertaking
of articles, things or computer software received in or brought into India by
the assessee in convertible foreign exchange but so as not to include inter
alia freight, telecommunication charges or insurance attributable to the
delivery of the articles, things or software outside India. Therefore in
computing the export turnover the legislature has made a specific exclusion of
freight and insurance charges. The submission which has been urged on behalf
of the revenue is that while freight and insurance charges are liable to be
excluded in computing export turnover, a similar exclusion has not been
provided in regard to total turnover. The submission of the revenue, however,
misses the point that the expression "total turnover" has not been defined at
all by Parliament for the purposes of s.10A. However, the expression "export
turnover" has been defined. The definition of "export turnover" excludes
freight and insurance. Since export turnover has been defined by Parliament
and there is a specific exclusion of freight and insurance, the expression
"export turnover" cannot have a different meaning when it forms a constituent
part of the total turnover for the purposes of the application of the formula.
Undoubtedly, it was open to Parliament to make a provision which has been
enunciated earlier must prevail as a matter of correct statutory
interpretation. Any other interpretation would lead to an absurdity. If the
contention Page 17 of 36 17 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 of the Revenue were to be
accepted, the same expression viz. 'export turnover' would have a different
connotation in the application of the same formula. The submission of the
Revenue would lead to a situation where freight and insurance, though these
have been specifically excluded from 'export turnover' for the purposes of the
numerator would be brought in as part of the 'export turnover' when it forms
an element of the total turnover as a denominator in the formula. A
construction of a statutory provision which would lead to an absurdity must be
avoided. Moreover, a receipt such as freight and insurance which does not have
any element of profit cannot be included in the total turnover. Freight and
insurance charges do not have any element of turnover. For this reason in
addition, these two items would have to be excluded from the total turnover
particularly in the absence of a legislative prescription to the contrary -

6.6. In the case of Sak Soft Ltd. (supra), the assessee was engaged in the
business of exporting computer software and claimed deduction u/s 10B of the
Act. In completing the assessment u/s 143(3) of the Act, the AO reduced the
expenditure incurred in foreign exchange in providing the technical services
outside India, from the export turnover without corresponding reduction from
total turnover, thereby reducing the deduction claimed by the assessment u/s
10B of the Act. 6.7. In light of the above facts, the Special Bench held as
under:-
Page 18 of 36 18 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 "For the above reasons, we hold that for
the purpose of applying the formula under sub-section (4) of section 10B, the
freight, telecom charges or insurance attributable to the delivery of articles
or things or computer software outside India or the expenses, if any, incurred
in foreign exchange in providing the technical services outside India are to
be excluded both from the export turnover and from the total turnover, which
are the numerator and the denominator respectively in the formula. The appeals
filed by the department are thus dismissed".
6.8 In the light of the above judgements and the order of the Special Bench
(Supra), we direct the AO to exclude the above mentioned expenses both from
the export turnover as well as from the total turnover while calculating
deduction u/s 10A of the Act. It is ordered accordingly. Hence, the ground No.
7 is allowed. Since the alternative plea of the assessee is allowed, the
ground nos. 5 & 6 raised by the assessee is not adjudicated.
7\. Ground Nos. 9 to 21 : Transfer Pricing Adjustment Briefly stated the facts
in relation to transfer pricing adjustment are as follows:-
According to the assessee, it is a captive service provider engaged in
providing software development and related services (software services), sales
and marketing support and customer support services (CSS or ITES) to its
Associated Enterprises (AE). For the assessment year 2007-08, the impugned
international transactions of the assessee company with its Associated
Enterprises was as under:-
Page 19 of 36 19 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 Nature of International Transactions
Amount in Rs.
               Software Services                             28,57,55,540
               Sales & Marketing Support and Customer         2,57,18,896
               Support Services (CSS/ITES)
For the purpose of establishing the Arm's Length Price (ALP) of its
international transactions with its AEs, the assessee had undertaken a
Transfer Pricing (TP) study, carried out by an independent external
consultant. Based on the TP study, the independent external consultant
concluded that the price received by the assessee in respect of its
transactions with AEs is at arm's length. The key features of the TP study
undertaken by the assessee for software services and ITES are summarized
below:-
> i) As per the functional analysis, the assessee was selected as the tested
> party;
> ii) Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) was determined as the most
> appropriate method to determine the ALP;
> iii) The search was conducted on Prowess database for obtaining publicly
> available financial information of companies in India engaged in similar
> business activity as that of the assessee to select comparable companies.
> iv) Given the nature of the international transactions under review,
> economic conditions, differences in business or product life cycles and
> other relevant factors, financial data for FY 2004-05, FY 2005-06 and FY
> 2006-07 was considered.
> v) The searches on the databases yielded a set of 28 comparables and 4
> comparables for software services and ITES respectively, with weighted
> average operating profit/operating cost of 10.62% and 13.30% for software
> services and ITES, respectively.
vi) No adjustment was made to the margins of the comparable companies to take
into consideration the Page 20 of 36 20 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 difference in
risks assumed by the comparable companies vis-à-vis the assessee.
7.1 The Transfer Pricing Officer re-determined the ALP for the provision of
software services and ITES transactions. The details of study undertaken by
the TPO reads as follows:-
> The TPO did not accept the economic analysis undertaken by the assessee
> company and identified new comparables at the time of assessment
> proceedings.
> The TPO used single year data (FY 2006-07) for economic analysis, instead of
> data for FY 2004-05 to 2006-07 used by the assessee company;
> The TPO has re-determined the operating margins of comparable companies by
> considering foreign exchange gain/losses as non-operating in nature;
> The TPO was of the view that some of the comparable companies identified by
> the assessee company and the approach adopted for undertaking the economic
> analysis were not appropriate. The TPO applied certain filters for the
> selection of comparable companies. In arriving at the ALP, the TPO rejected
> certain comparables identified by the assessee company on the following
> filters:-
> o Companies having turnover less than 1 crore were rejected for software
> services and ITES;
> o Companies having economic performance contrary to the industry behavior
> (e.g. companies which showed a diminishing revenue trend);
> Page 21 of 36 21 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 o Companies having onsite revenues
> greater than 75% of the export revenues' were rejected for software
> services.
> • The TPO obtained information by exercising his power vested under section
> 133(6) of the Act and used the same for judging comparability with the
> assessee company;
> • The TPO provided an adjustment towards capital of 2.23% and 2.89% for
> software services and ITES respectively. The adjusted net margins of
> comparable companies after providing the working capital adjustment was
> determined at 22.91% and 27.66% on operating cost for software services and
> ITES respectively.
> 7.2 The details of the comparable companies as per TPO in software

7.5 The learned AR submitted that the TPO has erred in identifying new
comparables at the time of assessment proceedings. It was submitted that the
TPO failed to appreciate that such data was not available in public domain at
the time of complying with the mandatory TP Page 24 of 36 24 ITA
No.970/Bang/2011 documentation required by the prescribed due date. It was
stated that the TPO has erred in using only single year data for his economic
analysis. The assessee, it was submitted, had used the data for the FY 2004-05
and FY 2005-06, apart from the data available for the FY 2006-07 in the case
of all the companies identified as comparables to the software services and
ITES transactions. It was argued that the TPO applied certain filters and did
not undertake an objective comparative analysis for selection of comparable
companies. It was further submitted that the TPO had obtained information,
which was not available in public domain from some other companies by
exercising his powers vested under section 133(6) of the Act and using the
same for judging the comparability with the assessee company. 7.5.1 It was
contended that the TPO did not make suitable adjustments to account for
differences in the risk profile of the assessee vis-à-vis the comparable
companies. The learned AR contended that the TPO based on additional analysis
and information obtained under section 133(6), identified 3 new companies as
comparable to Assessee Company which did not feature in the show cause notice
for the ITES transaction and the assessee was not provided an opportunity to
evaluate these companies for comparability purpose. It was stated that the TPO
did not consider that the adjustment to the ALP, if any, should be limited to
the lower end of the 5% range as the assessee has the right to exercise this
option under the proviso to section 92C(2) of the Act.
7.5.2. The Ld. A R finally stated that most of the above issues raised in the
present appeal under consideration have since been covered in the Page 25 of
36 25 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 assessee's own case in ITA No.1413/Bang/2010 dated
27.1.2012 for the AY 2006-07, such of the issues, namely:
(i) the comparable having the turnover of more than Rs.1 crore, but, less than
Rs.200 crores;
(ii) all the information relating to comparables which were sought to be used
against the appellant to be furnished to the appellant;
(iii) the appellant has to be extended an opportunity to cross-examine the
parties whose replies sought to be used against the appellant;
(iv) to give the benefit of +/- 5 per cent under the proviso to s.92C(2) of
the Act;
(v) with regard to deduction u/s 10A of the Act, etc., 7.5.3. The Ld. A. R.,
however, again put stress on the following three issues, namely:
> (1) The AO/TPO erred in not considering the foreign exchange fluctuation
> gain (loss) as part of the operating income while computing the operational
> margin.
In this connection, it was argued that the appellant had used TNMM as the most
appropriate method which provides that in applying the method, the net margin
was to be computed in relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets
employed by the enterprise. However, it was argued that the TPO had excluded
the foreign exchange fluctuation (income/expenses) stating that these were
non-operating in nature. It was, however, argued by the Ld. A R that the
foreign exchange fluctuation gain (loss) were closed linked to the business
operation and did not constitute abnormal-extra-
Page 26 of 36 26 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 ordinary items. Those differences arise
on account of number of factors, some of which, were explained as under:
(i) Realized foreign exchange gain/loss:
> (a) Export proceeds at a rate higher/lower than the rate at which they were
> booked;
> (b) Import payables at a rate lower/higher than the rate at which they were
> booked;
(c) Adjustment of customer advances (received in foreign currency) against
export invoices Relies on case laws:

CIT v. Woodward Governor India (P) Ltd (2007) 162 Taxman 60 Page 27 of 36 27
ITA No.970/Bang/2011 Thus, it was submitted that the exchange gains/losses in
connection with the income/expenses earned/incurred in foreign currency
retains the same character of the income/expense in connection with which it
has been earned/incurred. These items of income and expenditure would
generally be in the nature of export proceeds, import payables, traveling
expenses etc., it was, further, submitted that those items have direct nexus
with the operating profit/loss of the enterprises. Without appreciating the
above, it was submitted that the TPO had erred in not considering the
realized/unrealized foreign exchange gain/loss as operating in nature. In
conclusion, it was submitted that as the same was normal expenditure incurred
in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, should not have been
excluded by treating them as non-recurring item of expenditure while computing
the operating margin.
(2) With regard to difference in the risk profile, it was the submission of
the Ld. A R that the authorities below have erred by not making suitable
adjustments to account for differences in the risk profile of the assessee
vis-à-vis the comparables; that the assessee undertakes functions under a
limited risk environment vis-à-vis comparable companies who bear
entrepreneurial risk being independent service providers and, accordingly, an
adjustment for risk level differences was warranted. It was, further,
contended that the assessee had used the TNMM in determining the ALP for the
international transaction entered into during the FY 2006- 07; that the
provisions of rule 10B of the Rules prescribes the methods to be used and
manner in which it was to be used in determining the ALP relating to any
international transaction.
Page 28 of 36 28 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 Extensively quoting the provisions of
rule 10B (1)(e) of I.T. Rules, it was argued that:
> One of the principal elements for TP purposes is the analysis of risks
> assumed by the respective parties. In the open market theory, the assumption
> of increased risk is normally compensated by an increase in the expected
> return. Accordingly, controlled and uncontrolled transactions are comparable
> only when adjustments with respect to significant differences between them
> in the risks assumed is made.
> A risk analysis begins with the identification of specific and realistic
> risks borne by each related party. It is also important to note that
> economically significant risks count for transfer pricing purposes. Non-
> economically significant risks are of minor importance due to their small or
> negligible impact on the profits. Also, it is the significance of risks that
> positively correlates to the amount of expected return.
> As evident from the transfer pricing report, the appellant functions under a
> limited risk environment vis-à-vis entrepreneurial risk borne by comparable
> companies who are independent service providers. Accordingly, it is
> operating under economic circumstances that warrant adjustments to the
> margins earned by the comparable companies, so as to make the comparison
> between the margins earned by the comparable companies and the appellant
> appropriate.
The comparables selected for the analysis include companies which have fairly
diversified areas of specialization, perform additional functions viz.,
marketing, etc, and bear more risks akin to any third party independent
service provider vis-à-vis the appellant. The risks such as legal risk,
marketing risk, business risk, etc., are normally associated with every
independent company whereas the appellant is generally insulated from these
risks. Further, the appellant Page 29 of 36 29 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 bears
lesser business risk than independent comparable enterprises due to the nature
of its revenue model. It is guaranteed profits by way of a mark-up on costs
incurred, regardless of its success or failure. As a consequence, the margins
earned by the appellant would be comparatively lower to reflect the lower
level of business risk. In addition, it may be noted that among other risks,
the appellant does not bear any credit risk.
Where a related party sets prices for inter-company transactions so that the
appellant receives a specified level of operating profitability, the pricing
policy can have the effect of removing virtually all business risk from the
controlled entity. When analyzing controlled entities that bear such a low
level of risk by reference to a set of broadly comparable independent firms -
as is the case under TNMM - it is a challenge to identify independent firms
that are sufficiently comparable to the controlled entities in terms of risks
assumed. In circumstances where the appellant has been effectively guaranteed
a fixed return, functional similarity does not adequately address this risk
differential. In such cases, an adjustment to the comparables for this risk
differential seems warranted under the rules and would provide a more precise
pricing of the true risk borne by the appellant.
To buttress its claim, the assessee placed reliance on the following case
laws:
> (a) Westreco Inc. 64 CCH TCM 849;
> (b) Mentor Graphics (Delhi ITAT);
(c) Philips Software Centre Pvt. Ltd. (ITA, Bng)
(d) E-gain Communication Pvt. Ltd (ITAT, Pune) In respect of single customer
risk, it was submitted that -
Though, the assessee (a captive service provider) did not transact with any
other independent party and provided all the services only Page 30 of 36 30
ITA No.970/Bang/2011 to its AE and that the single customer risk was
insignificant based on the following:
> o The appellant has been providing software development and related services
> and ITES to its AE (i.e., single customer) for a long time. The appellant
> since the commencement of its operations in India has been making profits
> irrespective of the performance of the IT/ITES industry in India. The
> appellant does not bear any risk of incurring losses due to under
> utilization of capacity or insufficient business from its AE as it is
> compensated on cost plus basis i.e., all the cost incurred by the appellant
> are borne by the AE and reimbursed along with a mark-up;
> o Given the continued operations of the appellant for the subsequent years
> (i.e., FY 2007-08 to 2009-10), it is quite unlikely that the appellant would
> be winding off its business/operations in India o As mentioned in the
> documentation report, the AE does not avail similar services from any other
> third party in India and is, in a way, somewhat dependent on the appellant
> for deliverables/execution. While the appellant does not undertake any
> marking activity and is dependent on its parent/group for business, the AE
> is also somewhat dependent on the Indian entity for its
> operations/deliverables. Given the above and keeping in mind the fact that
> the AE has not attempted to engage another Indian person to perform software
> development support services in the subsequent years, it is quite unlikely
> that the AE would disassociate itself from this arrangement with the
> appellant.
Exhaustively deliberating market risk, political/country risk and also taking
cue from the findings of the earlier Bench in the case of Philips Software
Centre Private Limited v. ACIT and based on the methodology outlined in the
Page 31 of 36 31 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 said findings, the assessee had computed
the risk adjustments to be made to the margins of the comparable companies and
the summary computation is as under:
    Average prime lending rate during FY 2006-07 (A)                  11.88 percent
    Average bank rate during FY 2006-07 (B)                           06.00 percent
    Difference between the prime lending rate and bank rate           05.88 percent
    Risk adjustment (C)                                               05.88 percent
In conclusion, it was pleaded that in the light of the principles embodied in
the above findings, the benefit of a risk adjustment be extended to the
assesseee.
(3) Another grievance of the assessee was that Celestial Lab Limited
(Celestial Labs) ought not to have been selected as a comparable. In this
connection, the Ld. AR had submitted that Celestial Labs was a diversified
company operating in varied fields such as rendering IT Services encompassing
application development and maintenance production support, EERP, data ware-
housing SAP implementation. Celestial Labs was also is into manufacturing and
trading of products such as ERP package for manufacturing and had a product
'Sanjivani' which was a portal for live ayurvedic consultation. The company
was also engaged in the distribution of herbal ayurvedic products.
Further illustrating, it was explained that - SAP Services: Celestial delivers
SAP consulting, SAP implementation and post-SAP implementation services for
its customers. Celestial was engaged in implementing SAP for customers from
initial planning, design and Page 32 of 36 32 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
implementation to maintenance and on going optimization. Celestial helps the
company align IT Solutions with business strategies. Cel Sanjivani products:
Cel Sanjivani was a part of Celestial Labs Ltd, an ISO 9001-2000 company
working in this space of Bio-informatics and Gio- technology. The goal was to
become a primary market place for the herbal products providing quality
products to the customers and industrial community. This is an ayurvedic
portal dedicated to B28 & C market with online live consulting with out
ayurvedic consultants. It provides excellent platform for trading of herbal
products with identification raw herbs, scientific data, market and trade
data, monographs, policy, laws, good manufacturing practices, DNA finger
printing etc. It facilitates contacts with suppliers, manufacturers and
dealers of herbal Pharma industry.
In conclusion, the essence of the Ld. A.R's submission was that the activities
undertaken Celestial Labs were in the nature of providing multitude of IT
related services and some trading activity which was not comparable with the
assessee and, thus, it was not comparable to the functional profile of the
assessee and, accordingly, ought not to have been considered as comparable.
7.6 On the other hand, the Ld. D R fairly submitted that most of the issues
raised by the assessee have since been dealt with in the assessee's own case
in the immediately preceding assessment year wherein the earlier Bench had
remitted back the issues to the TPO for fresh consideration. As such, the Ld.
D R was in agreement with the plea of the Page 33 of 36 33 ITA
No.970/Bang/2011 Ld. A R to the effect that it would be appropriate to remit
back the present issues too to the TPO for fresh consideration as in the case
of the preceding assessment year.
7.7 We have carefully considered the rival submissions and also diligently
perused the relevant records as well as the case laws on which the Ld. A R had
placed reliance. It is a fact, as conceded by both the counsels, that most of
the issues raised under the heads 'transfer pricing adjustments' have also
cropped up in the assessee's own case for the AY 2006-07 wherein the earlier
Bench had, after due consideration of the facts and for the reasons recorded
therein, remitted back the issues to the TPO for fresh consideration. In
consonance with the findings of the earlier Bench, we are of the firm view
that the issues listed out by the appellant require fresh consideration at the
level of the TPO. Accordingly, we remit back the entire issues to the file of
the TPO for needful. It is needless to reiterate that the directions of the
earlier Bench contained its findings in the assessee's own case for the AY
2006-07 hold-good for this assessment year under consideration also. The
specific directions in assessee's case for assessment year 2006-07, for ready
reference reproduced below :-
> (i) the operating revenue and the operating cost of the transactions
> relating to associated enterprises only shall be considered;
> (ii) the comparables having the turnover of more than Rs.1 crore, but, less
> than Rs.200 crores only shall be taken into consideration;

                    (iii)    all the information relating to comparables which were
> sought to be used against the appellant shall be furnished to the appellant;
> (iv) the appellant shall also be extended an opportunity to cross-examine
> the parties whose replies were sought to be used against the appellant;
> (v) to consider the objections of the appellant that relate to additional
> comparables sought to be adopted by the TPO and to pass a detailed order;
> and
> (vi) to give the standard deduction of 5% under the proviso to s.92C(2) of
> the Act.
The TPO shall also keep in view the findings handed down in the case of M/s.
Genisys Integrating Systems (India) Ltd v. DCIT [ITA NO;1231(Bang)/2010 dated
5.8.2011] while considering the appellant's case afresh. 7.7.1. With regard to
the submissions of the Ld. A R in respect of (1) foreign exchange fluctuation
gain (loss) and (2) risk profile, we are of the considered view that there is
considerable force in the arguments put forth by the Ld. A R. the contentions
of the appellant have not been given due weight-age at the time of finalizing
the issues by the TPO as alleged by the assessee in its submissions (supra).
In the interests of principles of natural justice and fair-play and since many
of the issues have already been reverted back to the file of the TPO for fresh
consideration, we are of the considered view that these issues require to be
looked into afresh by the TPO in view of the assessee's assertions cited
supra, both of these issues are also required to be remitted back to the file
of the TPO for fresh consideration. It is ordered accordingly.
Page 35 of 36 35 ITA No.970/Bang/2011 7.7.2. In respect of the appellant's
other contention i.e., Celestial Labs Limited as a comparable, we would like
to recall the findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai Bench 'E' in the case of M/s.
Tevapharm Private Limited v. Addl. CIT - 10(3) in ITA No.6623/Mum/2011 (AY
2007-08) dated: 23.12.2011. The issue, in brief, before the Hon'ble Bench was
that the assessee had in one of its grounds objected to in picking up
Celestial Labs Limited as a comparable for the reason was that "5......The
activities undertaken Celestial Labs are in the nature of providing host of IT
related services and some trading activity which is not comparable to the
assessee. Hence, it is clear that it is not comparable to the functional
profile of the company and, accordingly, ought not to be considered a
comparable."
After considering the rival submissions, the Hon'ble Bench had observed thus:
> "5.............According to the learned D.R Celestial Labs is also in the
> filed of research in pharmaceutical products and should be considered as
> comparable. As rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the assessee,
> the discovery is in relation to a software for discovery of new drugs.
Moreover, the company also is owner of the IPR. There is, however, a reference
to development of a molecule to treat cancer using bio-informatics tools for
which patenting process was also being pursued. As explained earlier it is a
diversified company and, therefore, cannot be considered as comparable
functionally with that of the assessee. There has been no attempt made to
identify and eliminate and make adjustment of the profit margins so that the
difference in functional comparability can be eliminated. By not resorting to
such a process of making adjustment, the Page 36 of 36 36 ITA No.970/Bang/2011
TPO has rendered this company as not qualifying for comparability. We,
therefore, accept the plea of the assessee in this regard."
Concurring with the findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai Bench (supra) and also the
appellant's vehement objection in choosing Celestial Labs Limited as
comparable, we are of the considered view that this issue also requires a
fresh look at the TPO's level. To facilitate the TPO to comply with the
directions of this Bench (supra), we remit back this issue also to the file of
the TPO.
8\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed as
indicated above.

appellant's vehement objection in choosing Celestial Labs Limited as
comparable, we are of the considered view that this issue also requires a
fresh look at the TPO's level. To facilitate the TPO to comply with the
directions of this Bench (supra), we remit back this issue also to the file of
the TPO.
8\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed as
indicated above.
Order pronounced in the open court on 16th day of March, 2012.
