JUDGMENT M. Karpagavinayagam, J.
1\. The question posed before this Court in the above batch of writ appeals
and writ petitions is as to whether Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003, namely, Tamil
Nadu Tax on Consumption or Sale of Electricity Act, 2003 is valid or not?
2\. When the batch of writ petitions by the consumers, either individually or
by Association or by Corporate Sectors have been filed before the learned
single Judge, questioning the validity of the Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003, the
learned single Judge by the order dated 21.10.2003 dismissed those writ
petitions holding that the Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 is valid.
3\. The above batch of writ appeals have been filed before this Division Bench
challenging the said common order passed by the learned single Judge
dismissing those writ petitions in W.P. No. 17223 etc. of 2003. Apart from
these writ appeals, a number of writ petitions questioning the validity of the
Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 have also been listed before this Division Bench for
Sub-stations.
52\. With regard to the High Tension connections, a twin tariff system is
adopted, one rate as per KVA for each unit consumed, the other rate is on
permitted demand as per KVA. It is pointed out that as per the definition of
maximum demand, the same is determined on the energy delivered at a point of
supply. Even though the tariff is collected on the permitted demand, the tax
is levied only on the maximum demand, that is, on the energy consumed.
53\. Now, it is submitted by the learned Advocate General that the maximum
demand is what is really consumed by them as against the permitted demand and
therefore, the taxes are imposed only on the demand charges and it is based on
actual consumption.
54\. This statement by the learned Advocate General has been recorded by the
learned single Judge himself in paragraph 40 of his order. Therefore, it
cannot be contended that the levy is not valid.
55\. In view of the discussion made above, we do not find any reason to hold
that the order of the learned single Judge upholding the validity of the Act
Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 have also been listed before this Division Bench for
disposal.
4\. The Tamil Nadu Tax on Consumption or Sale of Electricity Act, 2003, that
is, the Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 is an Act of the Tamil Nadu Legislative
Assembly. The preamble to the Act reads thus:
An Act to consolidate and rationalize the laws relating to the levy of tax on
consumption or sale of electricity in the State of Tamil Nadu.
The Act received the assent of the Governor on 17.5.2003 and was published on
19.5.2003 in the Gazette.
5\. Section 2 is the definition section. Section 3 is the charging section. In
terms of Section 3, every licensee and every person other than a licensee
shall pay every month to the Government a tax on the electricity sold or
consumed at the rate specified in the said section. Section 4 exempts the sale
of energy for consumption to Government, local authority or railway company.
Section 5 directs registration of persons, who have installed generating
plants for generation of electricity for own consumption. Section 6 provides
that licensee may with the previous sanction recover from any person to whom
electricity is sold, the electricity taxes, which is to be paid by the
licensee in respect of electricity so sold. Section 7 provides for recovery of
electricity tax. Section 8 obligates the licensee to keep books of accounts
and submit return. Section 9 provides for assessment. Section 10 provides for
appeal. Section 11 provides for payment of interest in case of belated
payment. Sections 12 and 13 provide the appointment of electricity tax
inspecting officers and confer powers on them. Section 14 provides for
exemption and reduction of tax. Section 15 provides for conferment of powers
on the State Government to frame rules. Sections 17, 18 and 19 provide for
offences, compensation, protection to action taken in good faith and
penalties. Section 20 provides for repeal and savings. Section 21 directs that
the provisions of the Act shall have the effect subject to the provisions of
Article 288 of the Constitution.
6\. Challenging the validity of the Act 12 of 2003 containing the above
provisions and also the common order passed by the learned single Judge, the
learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in separate appeals would
make detailed submissions, which could be summed up as follows:
(1) The Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 levying tax on consumption or sale of
electricity is invalid for want of assent of the President of India, in view
of Article 288(2) of the Constitution of India.
(2) The impugned Act is a colourable piece of legislation for the reason that
the State Government and the Electricity Board had already approached the
Electricity Regulatory Commission and claimed for fixation of tariff and since
the Commission had not acceded to the claim in full, the Government in order
to overcome the said situation, has passed the impugned Act, even though the
power to fix tariff for electricity exclusively vests with the Commission
constituted under the Central Act. On that reason, the Act is liable to be
struck down.
(3) The impugned Act is repugnant to Section 29 of the Electricity Regulatory
Commissions Act, 1998. The Central Act, 1998 provided for the fixation of
tariff for electricity to vest with the Commission. The tariff so fixed should
be held to include the entire price payable for the energy. Thus, the impugned
State Act which imposes a tax on the sale or consumption of electricity is
repugnant to the Central Law. Since the State Act had not received the assent
of the President, it is not saved by Article 254(2) of the Constitution.
Hence, it is invalid in law.
(4) Under the Tamil Nadu Electricity Taxation on Consumption Act, 1962, some
of the appellants were exempted from payment of tax on consumption of self-
generated energy. Even though this Act 1962 has been repealed by the present
Act, in view of Section 20(2)(a) of the impugned Act, their rights are
protected. Therefore, they are entitled to continue the exemption from payment
of tax.
(5) In terms of the provisions of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act,
1998, when the State Government seeks to increase the tax from 5% in the case
of tax on sale of energy and above 10 paise per unit in the case of tax on
consumption of electricity, it is incumbent on the State Government to get
approval of the Commission even though under Section 3 of the impugned Act
fixing the rate of tax at the minimum level need not get approval of the
Commission. In this case, no approval for seeking to enhance the tax was
obtained. Therefore, it is repugnant to the Electricity Regulatory Commissions
Act.
(6) In terms of proviso to Section 3(1)(b) of the Act, no tax shall be payable
on the sale of electricity to any Electricity Boards. The said provision
cannot be restricted only to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The 'Board' has
not been defined in the present Act. Therefore, the definition of the 'Board'
occurring in the State Electricity Act will have to be taken into account,
which would include all Electricity Boards constituted under the Electricity
Supply Act, 1948.
(7) The tax on consumption should be actual consumption. It cannot include the
maximum/sanctioned demand charges. As such, the tax on consumption cannot be
levied on such electricity which is lost in transmission. The tax on
consumption of electricity should be based on the electricity consumed and not
on the electricity lost in transmission.

8\. Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned Advocate General appearing for the State
Government and Mr. R. Muthukumaraswamy, the learned Additional Advocate
General appearing for the Electricity Board, while refuting the above
submissions, would make detailed arguments justifying the reasoning given by
the learned single Judge in the common order. The gist of the reply in
nutshell is as follows:
The power to tax the sale or consumption of electricity is traceable to Entry
53 of List II of VII Schedule. It is a State list. So, it is sufficient, if
the State gets assent of the Governor. The assent of the President is not
necessary. The Central Law of 1998 did not provide any power to levy taxation
of electricity. The colourable legislation would not apply to the present
case, since the power with reference to the levy of tax on sale or consumption
of electricity is not referable to any Entry in List I, the Central Act. The
question of repugnancy would not arise as both the Central Act and State Act
would relate to the different Entries. Though the Act 1962 provides for the
exemption which the appellants availed till it is repealed. Section 20 of the
Act would not protect the rights and privileges acquired by the appellants as
there is an inconsistency between Act 1962 and the present Act. Merely because
the claim made by the State Government before the Commission was not acceded
to, the State Government cannot be mandated to get the approval of the
Commission in the absence of the provisions acquiring the same. With reference
to the tax on the maximum or sanctioned demand charges, it is already decided
by the learned single Judge that the Board would not impose tax on the
sanctioned demand or 90% of the sanctioned demand and tax would be imposed
only for the actual recorded energy demand which was consumed.
9\. The learned Advocate General and the Additional Advocate General appearing
for the State and Electricity Board respectively would cite the following
authorities:
1) Damodar Valley Corporation v. State of Bihar A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 1956;
2) Vijay Kumar Sharma v. State of Karnataka ;
3) State of West Bengal v. Purvi Communication Pvt. Ltd. ;

16) Gajraj Singh v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal .
10\. We have carefully considered the submissions and also gone through the
order of the learned single Judge as well as the citations.
11\. Let us now deal with the points one by one.
12\. The first submission referred to above would relate to the absence of the
assent from the President under Article 288(2) of the Constitution of India
read with Section 21 of the impugned Act. The powers of the Parliament and the
State Legislature to enact laws are governed by Articles 245 and 246 read with
Schedule VII of the Constitution. The Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction to
make laws under Article 246(1) with reference to the matters set out in List I
of Schedule VII. Similarly, the State Legislatures in terms of Article 246(3)
have the exclusive jurisdiction to make the laws with reference to the matters
set out in List II of VII Schedule. In terms of Article 246(3) of the
Constitution of India, the power to tax the sale or consumption of electricity
is traceable to Entry 53 of List II of VII Schedule. Therefore, the power is
traceable to a State list.
13\. Article 288 of the Constitution would contain two clauses. Article 288(1)
reads thus:
Save insofar as the President may by order otherwise provide, no law of a
State in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall
impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax in respect of any water or
electricity stored, generated, consumed, distributed or sold by any authority
established by any existing law or any law made by Parliament for regulating
or developing any inter-State river or river-valley.
Thus, the Article 288(1) provides that the State should not impose any tax in
respect of any water or electricity stored, generated, consumed, distributed
or sold by any authority established by any law for regulating or developing
any inter-State river or river-valley.
14\. Article 288(2) reads as under:
The Legislature of a State may by law impose, or authorise the imposition of,
any such tax as is mentioned in Clause (1), but no such law shall have any
effect unless it has, after having been reserved for the consideration of the
President received his assent; and if any such law provides for the fixation
of the rates and other incidents of such tax by means of rules or orders to be
made under the law by any authority, the law shall provide for the previous
consent of the President being obtained to the making of any such rule or
order.
The above Article 288(2) provides that the Legislature of a State may by law
impose any such tax mentioned in Clause (1), provided it received the assent
of the President. In substance, the above article provides that there cannot
be a law imposing tax on water or electricity dealt with by an authority
regulating or developing any inter-State river or river-valley when the law
gets assent of the President.
15\. Admittedly, the impugned Act, namely, Tamil Nadu Act 12 of 2003 had not
obtained the assent of the President. It means, the impugned Act cannot seek
to levy tax on sale or consumption of electricity by any authority regulating
or developing any inter-State river or river-valley.
16\. Let us now quote Section 3 of the Act, which reads thus:
Tax on the consumption or sale of electricity.--(1) Save as otherwise provided
in this Act, every licensee and every person other than a licensee shall pay
every month to the Government in the prescribed manner, a tax on the
electricity sold or consumed during the previous month at the rates specified
hereunder--
(a) In the case of licensees other than captive generating plants, the rate
shall be not less than 5% and nor more than 10% of the net charge, as may be
notified by the Government:
Provided that no tax shall be paid on sale of electricity for agricultural
purposes and but service connections;
(b) In the case of licensees who are captive generating plants, the rate shall
be not less than 10 paise and not more than 20 paise per unit of electricity
on the consumption for own use; and shall be not less than 5% and not more
than 10% on the net charge on the sale of surplus electricity as may be
notified by the Government:
Provided that no tax shall be paid on the sale of electricity to the Board.
(c) In the case of a person other than a licensee, the rate shall be not less
than 10 paise and not more than 20 paise per unit of electricity on the
consumption for own use as may be notified by the Government.
(2) The Government may pay such amount as may be prescribed as collection
charge to every person collecting electricity tax under this section;
Provided that such amount shall not exceed one percent of the electricity tax
collected by such person.
The reading of Section 3 would indicate that it is a charging section which is
general and seeks to levy tax on sale or consumption of electricity from any
licensee or any person other than the licensee.
17\. The said law would not be enforceable against any authority contemplated
by Article 288(1) of the Constitution. In other words, it is only when they
seek tax from those authorities, as provided under Section 21 of the impugned
Act, the State Government has to obtain assent.
18\. This is clear from the reading of Section 4 of the Act. Section 4 reads
thus:
Electricity sold for consumption to Government, local authority or Railway
Company not liable to Tax.-- Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act,
no electricity tax shall be payable under Section 3, on the sale of
electricity, by a licensee to--
(a) any Government for consumption by that Government, save in respect of
premises used for residential purposes;
(b) (i) any local authority, save in respect of premises used for residential
purposes;
(ii) Railway administration as defined in the Railways Act, 1989, save in
respect of premises used for residential purposes.
The above Section 4 would provide that the electricity sold for consumption to
Government, local authority or railway government not liable to tax. Section 4
thus exempts the Government from taxation liability.
19\. Since the Tamil Nadu was meant to cover all persons other than the
Government, Railways and authorities dealing with the development of inter-
State river, the Act has exempted the Government and Railways in terms of
Section 4.
20\. Once the said Article 288 of the Constitution of India makes a provision
for granting an exemption, it is clear that it will be applicable only to
those authorities who fall within the category entitled to exemption. Article
288, in fact, gives an immunity to an authority established by a law made by
Parliament for regulating or developing any inter-state river or river- valley
from being taxed in respect of any water or electricity stored, generated,
consumed, distributed or sold by such an authority. This immunity is specific
and directed only in favour of such authority as referred to in Article 288 of
the Constitution.
21\. In this context, it would be better to quote Article 286 of the
Constitution:
Restrictions as to imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods.--(1) No
law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale
or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place--
(a) outside the State; or
(b) in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out
of, the territory of India.
(2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale or
purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in Clause (1).
(3) Any law of a State shall, insofar as it imposes, or authorises the
imposition of,--
(a) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods declared by Parliament by law to be
of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce; or
(b) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods, being a tax of the nature referred
to in Sub-clause (b),Sub-clause(c) orSub-clause(d) of clause(29-A) of Article
366, be subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of
levy, rates and other incidents of the tax as Parliament may by law specify.
22\. Thus, it is clear that this Article imposes a total ban against a State
from imposing any tax on the purchase outside a State. This prohibition is
absolute. Whereas under Article 288 of the Constitution, the State is not
prevented from enacting a law, but it is made clear that the law shall not
have any effect against the authority mentioned in Article 288 of the
Constitution of India unless it receives the assent of the President. Thus,
the purpose of the article is to give protection only in respect of the
authorities generated, consumed, etc. of the electricity as referred to under
Article 288. Therefore, as correctly held by the learned single Judge, the
appellants, who are not such authorities described in the article, cannot take
umbrage under the said article and consequently, they cannot resist the
enforcement of Act 12 of 2003. Hence, the first submission would fail.
23\. The second and third submissions may be dealt with together. The second
submission is that the impugned Act is a colourable exercise of power. The
third submission is that the impugned Act is repugnant to the Central Act,
1998.
24\. The colourable legislation is one, which is attempted to by a Legislature
to pass a law under the pretext of a subject within its jurisdiction but on
scrutiny being found not within its jurisdiction but falling within the
jurisdiction of the other.
25\. In this case, the Central Act 1998 was meant to provide for establishment
of the Regulatory Commission at the Centre and State levels. Section 29 of the
Act deals with the power of the Commission to fix tariff. The purpose of
establishment of the Commission is to give effect to the common minimum action
plan for power. By the aforesaid Act, the tariff which was hitherto fixed
under the Electricity Supply Act by the Electricity Board, was taken over and
directed to be fixed by the Commission. This law relating to electricity is
referable to Entry 38 of List III, namely the concurrent subject. In other
words, Entry 38 is not a taxing entry. As a matter of fact, there is no taxing
power in List III. The Central Law of 1998 did not provide for any power to
levy taxation on electricity. As indicated above, the power to tax on sale or
consumption of electricity is specifically found in Entry 53 of List II (State
List).
26\. The tariff to be fixed by the Commission related only to the price for
the energy to be supplied by the licensees. In these circumstances, the
question of the said tariff including the taxation would not arise. On the
other hand, if we examine the impugned Act and in particular, the charging
section found in Section 3, it would be clear that the levy contemplated is a
tax on the sale or consumption of electricity which is exactly the same
subject found in Entry 53 of List II.
27\. Under the Act 12 of 2003, the term 'tariff' has been defined in Section
2(14) of the Act. This means, a tariff leviable on consumption as fixed by the
Commission. The tax is levied on the tariff. Therefore, it cannot be treated
as a part of the tariff.
28\. In this context, it would be worthwhile to refer to the observation made
by the Supreme Court in S.S. Bola v. B.D. Sardana , which clearly explains
what is the meaning of a colourable legislation:
Colourable legislation is one where the legislature has no power to legislated
on an item either because it is not included in the List of the respective
Entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in respect of which it has
competence to enact the law, or on account of limits imposed either in Part
III of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights or any other power
under the Constitution or in violation of the principle of basic structure of
the Constitution. If on an examination of the Act, the Court finds that the
legislature has travelled beyond its power or competence or in transgression
of the limits imposed by the Constitution itself, such an enactment is called
colourable legislation. In other words, it has a refernce to the legislative
incompetence and not to the power of the legislature as such. If the
legislature enacts the law in the pretext of the exercise of the legislative
power though actually it does not possess such power, the legislation to that
extent either is void or become voidable on a declaration to that effect by a
Constitutional Court. It would, therefore, be said that the Legislature enacts
the law in purported colourable exercise of its power.
29\. In the light of the above observation, it can be safely concluded that in
the instant case, the law in question is with reference to the subject tax on
sale or consumption of electricity which is squarely within Entry 53 of List
II and not referable to any Entry in List I and as such, the question of
colourable legislation does not arise.
30\. Similarly, the contention of repugnancy is also baseless. The question of
repugnancy would arise only when both the laws are enacted on the same entry.
The question of repugnancy between one law and another would arise only if
both the laws of the Parliament and the State Legislature are referable to an
Entry in List III. As indicated above, the Central Law is referable to Entry
38 List III while the State Law falls under Entry 53 List II. In these
circumstances, no question of repugnancy would arise.
31\. Let us now come to the fourth submission. This would relate to the saving
of exemption already granted. Prior to the impugned Act, there were two
enactments, namely, Electricity Duty Act, 1939 and Tamilnadu Electricity
Taxation and Consumption Act, 1962. The Electricity Duty Act, 1939 imposed tax
on sale of electricity without any provision for exemption. The Consumption
Act, 1962, which levies tax on consumption of electricity, provides for the
exemption. The appellants had availed exemption till the passing of the
impugned Act in terms of which both the Duty Act and the Consumption Act had
been repealed.
32\. It is contended that though this Act has been repealed, in view of
Section 20(1) of this Act, namely, Act 12 of 2003, by the saving clause, the
exemption granted will continue to enure to the benefit of the grantees,
despite the repeal. On the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the
Government that if they are able to show that the new Act is inconsistent with
the repealed enactments or that the exemption orders issued under the repealed
enactments cannot be deemed to have been issued under the new enactment, such
orders will not continue to be in operation.
33\. There is no dispute in the fact that the Duty Act, 1939, which provided
for tax on sale of electricity, did not contain any provision for exemption.
Only the Consumption Act, 1962, which imposed tax on consumed, provided for
exemption.
34\. However, Section 14 of the new Act contemplates exemption only with
reference to the tax on the sale of electricity for consumption and not on the
tax on consumption of electricity. Section 14 reads thus:
Exemption and reduction of tax.--The Government may, by notification, make an
exemption or reduction in rate in respect of the electricity tax payable under
this Act on electricity sold for consumption by or in respect of any--
(i) institution or class of person;
(ii)place of public worship, public burial or burning ground or other place
for the disposal of the dead;
(iii) premises declared by the State Government to be used exclusively for
purposes of public charity;
(iv) vessel whether seagoing or inland.
35\. Now, it is relevant to quote Section 20, which reads as follows:
Repeal and savings.--(1) The Tamil Nadu Electricity Duty Act, 1939 and the
Tamil Nadu Electricity (Taxation on Consumption) Act, 1962 is hereby repealed.
Provided that such repeal shall not affect--
(a) the previous operation of the said Acts or anything duly done or suffered
thereunder;
(b) any right, privilege, obligation or liability, acquired, accrued or
incurred under the said Act.
(c) any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence
committed against the said Acts;
(d) any investigation, legal proceeding (including assessment proceeding) or
remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid and any such investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced and any such
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if this Act had not been
passed;
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal,--
(a) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken
including any rule, notification, inspection order or notice made or issued or
any direction given under the repealed laws, shall so far as it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been come or
taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act;
(b) any duty levied under the repealed Tamil Nadu Electricity Duty Act, 1939
and the rules made thereunder during the period prior to the commencement of
this, but not collected, may be recovered in the manner provided under the
repealed Act and rules made thereunder;
(c) any tax levied under the repealed Tamil Nadu Electricity (Taxation on
Consumption) Act, 1962 and the rules made thereunder during the period prior
to the commencement of this Act, but not collected, may be recovered in the
manner provided under the repealed Act and the rules made thereunder.
(3) For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that nothing in Sub-
section (1) shall be constituted as preventing any person from claiming refund
of any tax or duty paid by him in excess of the amount due from him under the
repealed Acts and the rules made thereunder.
36\. The above Section 20, which is the repealed provision, contains three
sub-sections. Sub-section (1) protects the rights, privileges etc. acquired or
accrued under the repealed enactments. Sub-section 2(a) provides for
continuation of such rules, notifications etc. issued under the repealed laws
in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the new laws and
such orders can be deemed to be done under the corresponding provisions of the
new Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 20 would make it clear that it is only
such of those notifications, orders issued under the repealed Act, which are
consistent with the new Act that would continue in force and only the said
orders, Rules, notifications can be deemed to have been issued under the
corresponding provisions of the new Act.
37\. However, in this case, as indicated above, there is an exemption as
provided in Section 14 only with reference to the tax on the sale of
electricity and not on the tax on consumption of electricity. Thus, it is
clear that there is clear inconsistency between the Acts that have been
repealed and the repealing Act of 2003. In these circumstances, in view of
Section 20(2)(a) of the impugned Act, the exemption orders would cease to be
valid on the coming into force of the new Act. Hence, the appellants cannot
take advantage of Section 20(1) of the Act.
38\. The next submission would relate to the failure of the State Government
to get the approval of the Regulatory Commission, while increasing the tax
from 5% in the case of tax on sale of electricity and above 10 paise per unit
in the case of tax on consumption of electricity.
39\. It is pointed out by the learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellants that though the Act as such, as per Section 3 of the Act fixing the
rate of tax at the minimum level need not get approval of the Commission. The
State Government has to get the approval of the Commission when the Government
seeks to enhance the tax, or otherwise, it would be repugnant to the Central
Act.
40\. As correctly pointed out by the counsel for the appellants themselves,
the provisions of the impugned Act, particularly the charging section, i.e.
Section 3 do not contemplate approval of the Commission for the State
Government to issue a Notification fixing the rate of tax within the minimum
and the maximum contemplated by the Act.
41\. The impugned Act is a law relating to tax on sale or consumption of
electricity, which is a subject wholly falling within the purview of the State
Legislature under Entry 53 List II of the VII Schedule of the Constitution. It
is well established rule that the tax law would have to be construed with
reference to the provisions contained therein and there cannot be any
interference or addition to the said provisions unless the language of the Act
contemplated such addition. Therefore, even assuming that the Commission has
not approved some claims, in the absence of any provision either in the
impugned Act or in the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act indicating the
requirement to consult the Commission or to obtain the approval, there is no
question of the State Government requiring to get the approval of the
Commission for enhancement of the rate of taxes.
42\. In this context, it would be better to refer to some of the observations
made by the Supreme Court in the following authorities:
(i) In Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra , it is held thus:
The High Court accepted the submission that it provided a self-contained
definition of 'patent and proprietary medicines' for the purpose of the main
Act and severed the connection between the provisions of the Drugs Act as was
contemplated in earlier Explanation I, and consequently one need not look to
the Drugs Act at all for its interpretation and the Schedule was thence to be
interpreted as it existed along with that self-containing definition in
Explanation I. In doing so, the position that Patent and Proprietary
medicines" means "any medicinal preparation" which very "Medicinal
preparation" includes all drugs which are a remedy or prescription etc. as
defined in Section 2(g) of the Act. So a reference to the Drugs Act was still
necessary. No doubt this is an inclusive definition. To enlarge its denotation
a specific provision to include Ayurvedic preparations containing self-
generated alcohol which are not capable of being consumed as ordinary
alcoholic beverages was necessary. That having not been done by the
Explanation itself, it was not permissible to include it by the Circular. The
Explanation I could not have been in conflict with the provisions of the Act
and the Circular could not have been in conflict with the Explanation, the
Schedule, the Rules and the Act.
(ii) In Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. v. State of U.P. , it is observed as
follows:
Under the three lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Indian Constitution a
taxation entry in a legislative list may be with respect to an object or an
event or may be with respect to both. Article 246 makes it clear that the
exclusive powers conferred on Parliament or the States to legislate on a
particular matter includes the power to legislate with respect to that matter.
Hence, where the entry describes an object of tax, all taxable events
pertaining to the object are within that field of legislation unless the event
is specifically provided for elsewhere under a different legislative head.
Where there is the possibility of legislative overlap, courts have resolved
the issue according to settled principles of construction of entries in the
legislative lists.
(iii) In Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. v. Union of India , it is held as under:
There is a distinction between the object of tax, the incidence of tax and the
machinery for the collection of the tax. The distinction is important but is
apt to be confused. Legislative competence is to be determined with reference
to the object of the levy and not with reference to its incidence or
machinery.... The substance of the impugned Act must be looked at to determine
whether it is in pith and substance within a particular entry whatever its
ancillary effect may be. ... Where the encroachment is ostensibly ancillary
but in truth beyond the competence of the enacting authority, the statute will
be a colourable piece of legislation and constitutionally invalid. ... Apart
from passing the test of legislative competency, the Act must be otherwise
legally valid and would also have to pass the test of constitutionality in the
sense that it cannot be in violation of the provisions of the Constitution nor
can it operate extraterritorially.
43\. In the light of the above observations, it has to be concluded that the
provisions of the impugned Act do not contemplate any such approval of the
Commission for the State Government for enhancing the rate of taxes within the
minimum and the maximum contemplated by the Act. Hence, this point also would
fail.
44\. The next point would relate to the terms of proviso to Section 3(1)(b) of
the Act. Under this provision, no tax shall be payable on the sale of
electricity to any Electricity Boards and that the said provision cannot be
restricted only to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.
45\. It is contended that the word 'Board' has not been defined in the present
Act and in the circumstances, the definition of the 'Board' occurring in the
Electricity Supply Act will have to be taken into account, which would include
all the Electricity Boards constituted under the Electricity Supply Act, 1948.
46\. It is true that the word 'Board' has not been defined in the impugned
Act. The said word has been defined in the Electricity Supply Act. It means,
the State Electricity Boards are constituted under the Electricity Supply Act.
It therefore appears that the sale of electricity to the State Electricity
Boards will not be taxable.
47\. Challenging the exemption granted to the Board as discriminatory would
not be a valid ground to challenge the validity of the Act. The Electricity
Board stands in a different footing from the other generating units as it is a
State as per Article 12 of the Constitution. Further, this Act grants
exemption for the sale of electricity for agricultural purposes and house
service connections also. The Government as per this Act has also issued a
Notification exempting the tax for domestic purposes.
48\. It is submitted that as a matter of fact, no tax is levied on the supply
of electricity by the private generating unit to the Board. The tax is levied
only on the portion of electricity consumed for their own use at a rate
prescribed under the Act. So, this point also is devoid of merit.
49\. The next submission is that the tax on consumption should be actual
consumption only and it cannot include the maximum/sanctioned demand charges
and the tax on consumption cannot be levied on such electricity, which is lost
in transmission.
50\. As a matter of fact, as pointed out by the learned Advocate General, the
learned single Judge has considered this issue and held that the tax is on
actual consumption only.
51\. There are two types of consumption, one is Low Tension consumers and
another is High Tension consumers. In the case of Low Tension consumers,
electricity charges are collected on the basis of the electricity consumed by
the consumer, which is recorded in the meter. In the case of High Tension
consumers, the tariff charges are based on two part tariff. Firstly, energy
charges based on the meter reading and secondly, demand charges. In the case
of High Tension consumers, they seek sanction for the load depending on the
machinery. The Board after considering the application, sanctions the claim.
This is called sanctioned demand. After the sanction, the Board creates proper
infrastructure to enable the Board to supply the electricity through their
Sub-stations.
52\. With regard to the High Tension connections, a twin tariff system is
adopted, one rate as per KVA for each unit consumed, the other rate is on
permitted demand as per KVA. It is pointed out that as per the definition of
maximum demand, the same is determined on the energy delivered at a point of
supply. Even though the tariff is collected on the permitted demand, the tax
is levied only on the maximum demand, that is, on the energy consumed.
53\. Now, it is submitted by the learned Advocate General that the maximum
demand is what is really consumed by them as against the permitted demand and
therefore, the taxes are imposed only on the demand charges and it is based on
actual consumption.
54\. This statement by the learned Advocate General has been recorded by the
learned single Judge himself in paragraph 40 of his order. Therefore, it
cannot be contended that the levy is not valid.
55\. In view of the discussion made above, we do not find any reason to hold
that the order of the learned single Judge upholding the validity of the Act
12 of 2003 would suffer from any infirmity. In our view, the reasonings given
by the learned single Judge in his order are perfectly justified.
56\. Hence, all the writ appeals and the writ petitions are dismissed.
Consequently, connected WAMPs., WVMPs and WPMPs. are closed. No costs.
