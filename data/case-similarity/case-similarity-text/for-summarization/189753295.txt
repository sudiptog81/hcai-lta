Rajendra Menon, Chief Justice (Oral)
1\. Challenge in this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
is made to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018
in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra), particularly in
para-104 as detailed hereinabove, it is clear that the ordinance only declares
talaq which is instant and irrevocable to be an offence and this is done in
view of the fact that the Supreme Court goes on to hold that this form of
talaq is manifestly arbitrary as the marital ties can be broken capriciously
and whimsically by a muslim man without any attempt for reconciliation and,
therefore, is violative of the fundamental rights contained in Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. That being so, it is not all forms of talaq which
is made punishable under the ordinance. It is only the form of talaq which
becomes effective instantaneously on its pronouncement and which is
irrevocable which is declared to be an offence.
18\. Taking note of all these factors, we are of the considered view that the
ordinance in question has been brought into force in accordance with the
requirements of law only to make more effective implementation of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India
(supra) in the form of an ordinance and we see no reason to make an W.P.(C)
is made to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018
and a mandamus is sought to declare the entire ordinance as ultra vires the
Constitution. The petitioner claiming to be a practicing advocate has
approached this Court to challenge the ordinance in question on the ground
that it adversely affects his fundamental rights besides affecting the rights
of citizens of this country, the ordinance runs contrary to the shared belief,
practice and tradition of Islam, is discriminatory in nature and, therefore,
should be declared as ultra vires.
W.P.(C) No.10341/2018 Page 1 of 13
2\. It is the case of the petitioner that the Supreme Court in the case of
Shayara Bano vs. Union of India & Ors., (2017) 9 SCC 1 declared the practice
of instant triple talaq to be unconstitutional. Thereafter on 28th December,
2017 Lok Sabha passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage)
Bill, 2017. On 9th August, 2018 amendments to the Bill was circulated in the
Rajya Sabha and on 10th August, 2018, the Chairman, Rajya Sabha declared that
the Bill could not be presented due to lack of consensus and thereafter on
19th September, 2018, it is said that the ordinance in question was
promulgated.
3\. It is argued that the manner in which the ordinance has been promulgated
is arbitrary and unsustainable, by promulgating the ordinance, Union of India
has acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner. It is submitted that there are
three forms of talaq in Islam, namely, Talaq-e-ahsan, Talaq-e- hasan and
Talaq-e-biddat. By declaring Talaq-e-biddat to be an offence, it is argued
that the same amounts to excessive and unnecessary legislation when the
Hon'ble Supreme Court itself in Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra) by a
majority judgment of 3:2 has already declared the said form of talaq as
invalid and unconstitutional. It is said that once the law laid down by the
Supreme Court declares such a practice to be unconstitutional, there is no
necessity for promulgating an ordinance, when under Article 141 of the
Constitution the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding. It was further
argued that the power of promulgating an ordinance has been misused and it is
an abuse of the process of law. It further pointed out that by making triple
talaq as an offence, the provisions of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the
Constitution are violated. It is submitted that the husband by W.P.(C)
No.10341/2018 Page 2 of 13 pronouncing Talaq-e-Biddat does not consider the
spouse as his wife and leaves her, that is, he only deserts her and does not
divorce. Now, as it is an invalid form of divorce and as desertion of a wife
is not punishable under the Indian Law, it is argued that the ordinance which
makes the talaq in question as an offence is unsustainable in law.
4\. It is further argued that a system which is already declared as illegal
and invalid by operation of law laid down by the Supreme Court need not be
incorporated in the form of an ordinance to make it punishable. That apart,
prescribing the punishment of three years is said to be an arbitrary decision
on account of the fact that it is discriminatory as certain other serious
offences like offences punishable under Section 147, 304A, 171E of the IPC
prescribed lesser punishment of 1 to 2 years. Inter alia contending that on
these grounds, the entire ordinance be struck down as ultra vires the
Constitution, this writ petition has been filed.
5\. Ms.Monika Arora, the learned CGSC appears for the Central Government,
refutes the aforesaid contentions and points out that the ordinance has been
brought into force by virtue of the provisions of Article 123(1) of the
Constitution at a period when the Parliament is not in session and, therefore,
at this stage interference into the matter may not be made. That apart, she
points out that once in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra) by
majority it has been held that the procedure for divorce by adopting the
system of triple talaq is declared to be unconstitutional and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution, if the Government in its wisdom thought it
appropriate to make it an offence, no unconstitutionality is committed in the
matter. That apart, she argues that at this stage the W.P.(C) No.10341/2018
Page 3 of 13 ordinance has only been brought into force, it is yet to be
passed by the Parliament and, therefore, interference is not called for.
6\. Having considered the contentions as were advanced before us, we find that
merely because the Bill was presented in the Rajya Sabha and after the Rajya
Sabha was adjourned sine die, in the absence of the Parliament not being in
session the ordinance has been promulgated by the Union of India in exercise
of its power of legislation under Article 123(1) of the Constitution, we see
no reason to make an indulgence into the matter. Except for contending that
the decision is arbitrary and without any justification an ordinance has been
brought into force, nothing on facts except pointing out the number of
instances when such a form of divorce has been resorted to, is brought to our
notice on the basis of which the decision to promulgate the ordinance can be
termed as arbitrary or illegal. The petitioner in ground (p) of the writ
petition tries to indicate the number of cases for various periods where the
system of triple talaq has been invoked and it is his case that there was no
emergency or exonerating circumstance to warrant use of the powers of
promulgating an ordinance under Article 123(1). Apart from the fact that the
statistics given in the pleading is not supported by any cogent material or
evidence if the Union of India in its wisdom thought it appropriate to
promulgate an ordinance based on the law laid down by the Supreme Court, we
see no reason to make any indulgence into the matter on the ground that it
amounts to arbitrary exercise of power without there being any cogent material
or evidence in support of the aforesaid contention, merely on the basis of
vague or unspecified allegations, this ground is unsustainable.
W.P.(C) No.10341/2018 Page 4 of 13
7\. As far as the contention of the petitioner that once this system of
divorce is already held illegal and unconstitutional by the Supreme Court,
there is no reason for putting in place any law on the subject is concerned,
we find that the law in question has been brought into force to protect the
rights of married muslim women and to make the system and form of talaq having
the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce an offence and impose
criminal liability in case this illegal form of divorce is put into practice
by any person.
8\. The Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra)
considered the provisions of the Muslim Personal Law, the practice of Talaq-e-
Biddat or triple talaq and held that the practice of triple talaq, that is,
instant, irrevocable, unilateral divorce by a husband as a formula for
pronouncing divorce three times as unconstitutional and cannot be permitted.
In the majority judgment, in para-104, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
crystallized the law after detailed deliberations in the following manner:-
> "104. Given the fact that Triple Talaq is instant and irrevocable, it is
> obvious that any attempt at reconciliation between the husband and wife by
> two arbiters from their families, which is essential to save the marital
> tie, cannot ever take place. Also, as understood by the Privy Council in
> Rashid Ahmad [Rashid Ahmad v. Anisa Khatun, 1931 SCC OnLine PC 78 :
> (1931-32) 59 IA 21 : AIR 1932 PC 25] , such Triple Talaq is valid even if it
> is not for any reasonable cause, which view of the law no longer holds good
> after Shamim Ara [Shamim Ara v. State of U.P., (2002) 7 SCC 518 : 2002 SCC
> (Cri) 1814] . This being the case, it is clear that this form of talaq is
> manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken
> capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at W.P.(C)
> No.10341/2018 Page 5 of 13 reconciliation so as to save it. This form of
> talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the fundamental right
> contained under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In our opinion,
> therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce Triple
> Talaq, is within the meaning of the expression "laws in force" in Article
> 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to the extent that it recognises
> and enforces Triple Talaq. Since we have declared Section 2 of the 1937 Act
> to be void to the extent indicated above on the narrower ground of it being
> manifestly arbitrary, we do not find the need to go into the ground of
> discrimination in these cases, as was argued by the learned Attorney General
> and those supporting him." (emphasis supplied)
9\. The aforesaid enunciation of law by the Supreme Court is after analysing
the Muslim Personal Law, the practice and the entire law with regard to talaq.
The judgments of various Courts dealing with the issue in question have been
scrutinized, which includes the judgment of the Madras High Court in the case
of A.S.Parveen Akhtar vs. Union of India, (2002) SCC Online Mad. 836 wherein
while considering the constitutional validity of Section 2 of the Muslim
Personal Law, Shariat Application Act, 1937 insofar as it recognizes triple
talaq as a valid form of divorce. The Court referred to various provisions of
the Holy Quran, opinion of various eminent scholars of Islamic Law, previous
judicial pronouncements including the law laid down by the Supreme Court in
the case of Shamim Ara vs. State of U.P., (2002) 7 SCC 518 to hold that talaq
in whatever form practiced must be for reasonable cause and has to be preceded
by an attempt for reconciliation and if undertaken otherwise, is an arbitrary
unreasonable act.
10\. The High Court of Jammu & Kashmir also in the case of Manzoor Ahmad Khan
vs. Saja, (2010) 4 JKJ 380 has referred to the judgments of W.P.(C)
No.10341/2018 Page 6 of 13 the Supreme Court and various High Courts and
opined that these judgments are nothing but an eye opener for those who think
that a muslim man can divorce his wife merely at his own whim or on caprice.
It has been held by the Jammu & Kashmir High Court in the aforesaid case that
by this system the marriage between the parties cannot be dissolved.
11\. The Kerala High Court in the case of Kayyumparamb Ummer Farooque vs.
Peredath Naseema, (2005) SCC Online Ker. 471 has also considered the same
provisions, the decisions of various High Courts and the Supreme Court and has
approved the proposition to the effect that the instant dissolution of
marriage by the husband without any effort for reconciliation is not
sufficient to effect a divorce under the Mahomedan Law. Even a Bench of this
Court in the case of Masroor Ahmed vs. State (NCT of Delhi), (2008) 103 DRJ
137 after following the law laid down in the case of Shamim Ara (supra) has
approved the aforesaid principle of law. In the case of Shayara Bano (supra)
before declaring the practice of triple talaq to be unconstitutional, as
detailed hereinabove, the provisions of Article 25(2) of the Constitution has
been considered by His Lordship Justice Kurian Joseph in his opinion and His
Lordship goes on to hold that there cannot be any constitutional protection to
such a practice and he declares it to be ultra vires the Constitution and the
fundamental rights available to a citizen. His Lordship Justice Rohinton Fali
Nariman before finally declaring the law (by majority) as detailed hereinabove
in para-104 has analysed various judgments not only of the Constitutional
Bench of the Supreme Court and other Division Benches but judgments of various
High Courts, the importance of gender discrimination, safeguards against
arbitrary W.P.(C) No.10341/2018 Page 7 of 13 divorce, various forms of talaq
prescribed in the Muslim Personal Law, the constitutional protection available
under Section 25 and the conclusion arrived at para-104 is a result of all
those discussions and analysis. Before doing so, Justice Nariman also refers
to concept of arbitrariness as envisaged under Article 14 of the Constitution,
the law laid down in the case of Shamim Ara (supra) and the judicial
precedents with regard to declaring a law to be constitutionally ultra vires
invalid and comes to the conclusion that the system of triple talaq is
unconstitutional, arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
12\. It is a well settled and cardinal principle of law that a legislation
passed by the Parliament can be set aside only on constitutionally recognized
grounds, namely, grounds of legislative competence and whether the legislation
is ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution or the same violates
fundamental rights or any other provisions of the Constitution. It may also be
challenged on grounds of unreasonableness if it violates the principle of
equality enshrined in our Constitution or unreasonably restricts the
fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution. However, a legislation
cannot be challenged only on the ground that it is unreasonable or that it is
not to the liking of a particular person or a group of persons. If we analyse
the present piece of legislation in the backdrop of the aforesaid law, we find
that the ordinance in question has been brought into force by following the
principles enumerated under Article 123(1) of the Constitution. It prescribes
a particular act which is already declared as ultra vires and unconstitutional
by the Constitution Bench in the case of Shayara Bano (supra) to be punishable
as the act violates the fundamental right and W.P.(C) No.10341/2018 Page 8 of
13 the rights of equality under the Constitution to a woman.
13\. That being so, none of the ingredients necessary for impugning the
legislation on account of legislative competency or unreasonableness as it
restricts the fundamental rights under Article 19 is available in this case,
for the simple reason that the form of talaq as described in Section 2(b) of
the impugned ordinance is already declared to be unconstitutional and
arbitrary by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of
Shyara Bano (supra). If an act is found to be manifestly arbitrary and
unconstitutional by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and if such an act is declared
to be an offence punishable under law, this Court cannot interfere into the
legislative act of making punishable such a manifestly arbitrary act which is
already declared under law to be violative of Article 14.
14\. In fact, the main contention of the petitioner before us was that once
the law declared by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano (supra)
prohibits practicing such a form of dissolution of marriage, there is no
necessity for further bringing into place a law for again doing something
which is nothing but a law laid down by the Supreme Court by virtue of Article
141 of the Constitution. In our considered view, this argument cannot be
accepted and is misconceived. What the Supreme Court does in the case of
Shayara Bano (supra) is a declaration to the effect that the practice of
triple talaq is unconstitutional, arbitrary and cannot be given effect to or
practiced. If in spite of such a declaration of law by the Supreme Court to
prevent use of this system of talaq being still practiced, the
legislator/Union of India, as a measure of deterrent in its own wisdom,
legislates a law to declare it to be an offence and makes it punishable, we
W.P.(C) No.10341/2018 Page 9 of 13 see no reason to hold that this is an
arbitrary or an unreasonable act or a colourable exercise of power. In fact,
in furtherance to the law declared by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayra
Bano (supra), the ordinance in question is for protecting the right available
to a muslim woman and to enforce the law declared by the Supreme Court in its
right earnest in letter and spirit. If we go through the aims and objects
which compelled the legislation to be brought into force, we find that the
legislature/Union of India was of the opinion that in spite of the practice of
triple talaq being declared as unconstitutional, the said practice continues
unabated and, therefore, to curb the same, the impugned ordinance in question
has been brought into force. That being the factual position, the contention
of the petitioner that it was not necessary to bring any such legislation or
ordinance, in our considered view is a misconceived submission which cannot be
accepted.
15\. If we analyse the impugned ordinance in question, we find that it only
deals with certain procedure to curb the practice of this form of
unconstitutional talaq being followed and is an effort to protect the right of
a married woman and for doing so even custody of a child, that is, minor child
is being protected and given to the married woman who is a victim of such
unconstitutional act on the part of her husband. In our considered view, there
is nothing which has been specifically brought to our notice or argued on the
basis of which we can hold that the ordinance in question is unconstitutional
or ultra vires any provisions of the Constitution.
16\. Once this form of talaq is declared as unconstitutional and impermissible
by the Supreme Court, if the Government/legislature in its W.P.(C)
No.10341/2018 Page 10 of 13 wisdom thought it appropriate to make such
unconstitutional or illegal act an offence, we, in exercise of our
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, cannot
declare the law making such an act punishable as ultra vires the Constitution.
The legislature or the Union of India thought it appropriate to protect the
rights of women belonging to a particular section of the society, declares an
unconstitutional act to be an offence also under the impugned ordinance, we
see no reason to interfere into the matter merely because the law laid down by
the Supreme Court takes care of the issue in question. The law laid down by
the Supreme Court only mandates that such a form of talaq is unconstitutional
and cannot be permitted and if based on the aforesaid, the Government declares
this act as an offence, we see no unconstitutionality in the same. The law
laid down by the Supreme Court does not declare the act to be punishable or an
offence under the criminal law, but now the Union of India or the legislature
in their wisdom can always declare such an unconstitutional act to be a
criminal offence also and if the same is done, we see no reason to declare it
ultra vires the Constitution.
17\. The petitioner, during the course of hearing, tried to indicate that
under the Muslim Personal Law, there are different forms of talaq, namely,
three as detailed hereinabove and they only relate to dissolving the marriage
between the party and certain conditions are stipulated for giving effect to
the different forms of talaq or divorce. It is argued that by making each and
every form of talaq an offence, the rights available to the citizens of a
particular section of the society is being taken away. It was tried to be
emphasized that the mode of pronouncing talaq causing no effect on the W.P.(C)
No.10341/2018 Page 11 of 13 marital ties between the husband and wife cannot
qualify to be an offence. If we analyse the definition of talaq as is
contained in Section 2(b) of the ordinance, we find that "talaq" means talaq-
e-biddat or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous
and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a muslim man. It is, therefore, clear
that it is not that all forms of talaq which have been classified as an
offence. It is only such talaq which takes effect instantaneously and is
irrevocable after its pronouncement which has been made an offence and this,
if analysed in the backdrop of the principles laid down by the Supreme Court
in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra), particularly in
para-104 as detailed hereinabove, it is clear that the ordinance only declares
talaq which is instant and irrevocable to be an offence and this is done in
view of the fact that the Supreme Court goes on to hold that this form of
talaq is manifestly arbitrary as the marital ties can be broken capriciously
and whimsically by a muslim man without any attempt for reconciliation and,
therefore, is violative of the fundamental rights contained in Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. That being so, it is not all forms of talaq which
is made punishable under the ordinance. It is only the form of talaq which
becomes effective instantaneously on its pronouncement and which is
irrevocable which is declared to be an offence.
18\. Taking note of all these factors, we are of the considered view that the
ordinance in question has been brought into force in accordance with the
requirements of law only to make more effective implementation of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India
(supra) in the form of an ordinance and we see no reason to make an W.P.(C)
No.10341/2018 Page 12 of 13 indulgence into the matter.
19\. The petition is, therefore, dismissed in limine.

is arbitrary and unsustainable, by promulgating the ordinance, Union of India
has acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner. It is submitted that there are
three forms of talaq in Islam, namely, Talaq-e-ahsan, Talaq-e- hasan and
Talaq-e-biddat. By declaring Talaq-e-biddat to be an offence, it is argued
that the same amounts to excessive and unnecessary legislation when the
Hon'ble Supreme Court itself in Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra) by a
majority judgment of 3:2 has already declared the said form of talaq as
invalid and unconstitutional. It is said that once the law laid down by the
Supreme Court declares such a practice to be unconstitutional, there is no
necessity for promulgating an ordinance, when under Article 141 of the
Constitution the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding. It was further
argued that the power of promulgating an ordinance has been misused and it is
in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (supra), particularly in
para-104 as detailed hereinabove, it is clear that the ordinance only declares
talaq which is instant and irrevocable to be an offence and this is done in
view of the fact that the Supreme Court goes on to hold that this form of
talaq is manifestly arbitrary as the marital ties can be broken capriciously
and whimsically by a muslim man without any attempt for reconciliation and,
therefore, is violative of the fundamental rights contained in Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. That being so, it is not all forms of talaq which
is made punishable under the ordinance. It is only the form of talaq which
becomes effective instantaneously on its pronouncement and which is
irrevocable which is declared to be an offence.
18\. Taking note of all these factors, we are of the considered view that the
ordinance in question has been brought into force in accordance with the
requirements of law only to make more effective implementation of the law laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India
(supra) in the form of an ordinance and we see no reason to make an W.P.(C)
is made to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Ordinance, 2018
and a mandamus is sought to declare the entire ordinance as ultra vires the
Constitution. The petitioner claiming to be a practicing advocate has
approached this Court to challenge the ordinance in question on the ground
that it adversely affects his fundamental rights besides affecting the rights
of citizens of this country, the ordinance runs contrary to the shared belief,
practice and tradition of Islam, is discriminatory in nature and, therefore,
should be declared as ultra vires.

2\. It is the case of the petitioner that the Supreme Court in the case of
Shayara Bano vs. Union of India & Ors., (2017) 9 SCC 1 declared the practice
of instant triple talaq to be unconstitutional. Thereafter on 28th December,
2017 Lok Sabha passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage)
Bill, 2017. On 9th August, 2018 amendments to the Bill was circulated in the
Rajya Sabha and on 10th August, 2018, the Chairman, Rajya Sabha declared that
the Bill could not be presented due to lack of consensus and thereafter on
19th September, 2018, it is said that the ordinance in question was
promulgated.
