> 8\. Recovery of Expenses 13,570,867 Total 1,132,473,830
5\. Common/identical issue involved in all the aforesaid appeals is that the
taxpayer in its TP analysis has selected Resale Price Method (RPM) as the Most
Appropriate Method (MAM) with Gross Profit / Sales (GP/Sales) as the Profit
Level Indicator (PLI), selected 16 comparables in AY 2011-12 with GP/Sales
margin at 5.51% as against taxpayer's GP/Sales margin at 6.55% and found its
international transactions qua AYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013- 14 with regard
to trading of goods at arm's length.
6\. TPO in all the years viz. AY 2011-12, 2012-13 & 2013-14 rejected RPM as
the MAM applied by the taxpayer for benchmarking its international
transactions for trading Fujitsu products in India i.e. purchase of goods and
spares for trading in India, however applied Transactional Net Margin Method
14 ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 (TNMM) as
MAM adopted same comparables as selected by the taxpayer in TP study by
applying RPM method and proposed the TP adjustment of Rs.58,724,008,
Rs.79,243,871 & Rs.4,49,492,709 for AYs 2011-12, 2012-13 & 2013-14
respectively.
7\. The taxpayer carried the matter before the ld. CIT (A) by raising
objections who has approved the findings returned by the TPO qua proposed TP
Adjustment in all the three years involved. Feeling aggrieved, the taxpayer
has come up by way of filing appeals challenging the impugned orders passed by
the AO/TPO/DRP.
8\. We have heard the ld. Authorized Representatives of the parties to the
appeal, gone through the documents relied upon and orders passed by the
revenue authorities below in the light of the facts and circumstances of the
case.
GROUNDS NO.1 & 2 IN ITA No.1674/Del./2016 (AY : 2011-12) ITA No.1982/Del./2017

10\. Ground No.3 in 1674/Del./2016 (AY : 2011-12) and ITA No.1982/Del./2017
(AY : 2012-13) is dismissed having not been pressed during the course of
arguments.

(AY : 2013-14)
11\. It is also not in dispute that the taxpayer is trading in servers,
laptops, notepads, etc. which are hardware equipments of IT segments. It is
the case of the TPO that during TP proceedings, the taxpayer accepted that
purchase of trading goods includes goods for components of IT support
services. So, these two types of goods being intrinsically inter-connected, it
is not correct to benchmark trading at gross level and other parts at net
level because at the gross level there is a positive income and at the net  16
ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 level, there
is a loss of 75%. It is also not in dispute that the TPO has not proposed TP
adjustment on account of Advertisement, Marketing and Promotion (AMP)
expenses. However, the AMP adjustments have been made by ld. DRP.
12\. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the
sole question arises for determination in this case is :-
> "as to whether TPO/DRP have erred in substituting RPM as the MAM with TNMM
> by rejecting the Gross Profit/Sales (GP/Sales) as the Profit Level Indicator
> (PLI) by substituting the same with OP/Sales to determine the Arm's Length
> Price (ALP) of the international transactions entered into between the
> taxpayer and its Associated Enterprises (AE) during the years under
> assessment?"
13\. Ld. AR for the taxpayer contended inter alia that the taxpayer is to be
treated as a normal distributor even if there are multiple transactions; that
the taxpayer is selling servers, laptops and notepads without any value
addition; that the taxpayer is incurring a routine normal advertising expenses
which cannot increase the value of the product but will certainly increase the
sales.
14\. However, on the other hand, to repel the arguments of the ld. AR for the
taxpayer, the ld. DR for the Revenue contended that in the gross margin level,
the taxpayer has not considered all the  17 ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA
No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 relevant cost because the taxpayer has
positive gross profit in trading segment but at the net level, there is a loss
of 75.26%; that the taxpayer is performing multiple functions including
purchase order, warehousing inventory control, quality control, budgets and
for casting, pricing and marketing and sales, therefore, the taxpayer is not
merely a distributor i.e. sale and purchase of goods, but also performed host
of functions such as marketing including brand building.
15\. TPO has based his entire findings on the sole ground that the taxpayer is
not a normal distributor as he has been performing host of functions including
purchase order, warehousing and inventory control, quality control, budgeting
and forecasting, pricing and marketing and sales which the taxpayer needs to
carry out within its distribution function to ensure that its goods reached
the market and ready for actual resale. It is also the case of the TPO that
unless the taxpayer has made proper warehousing arrangement or has proper
inventory control, its goods will not move to the point of sale which can be
said of the marketing efforts of the taxpayer.
16\. TPO also proceeded to change the method on the premises that the taxpayer
has incurred AMP expenses of Rs.15,425,168/- against the trading revenue of
Rs.81,738,810 which is 18.87%  18 ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017
ITA No.7088/Del./2017 which is definitely much higher than the expenses of a
routine distributor. TPO also not entertained the arguments of the taxpayer
that the net level loss the taxpayer has suffered is due to failure of the
business/ project plans for the financial years on the ground that AE ought to
have been supported the taxpayer either by reimbursement of cost or some price
support in the international transaction of purchase of finished goods by the
taxpayer. So, the TPO proceeded to believe that the net loss of the taxpayer
is linked to the transfer price that the taxpayer has agreed with its AE and
in these circumstances, TNMM is the most appropriate method.
17\. However, when we examine the arguments addressed by both the ld.
Representative for the parties to the appeal in the light of the undisputed
facts, it goes to prove that the taxpayer has purchased finished goods ready
for sale in the market from its AE without making any value addition to the
same. The function performed by the taxpayer for issuance of the purchase
order, budget control, quality checks, etc. would not change the role of the
taxpayer other than a normal distributor.
18\. Now, the question arises for determination in this case is as to whether
functions performed by the taxpayer with regard to  19 ITA No.1674/Del./2016
ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 quality control, warehousing,
sales and marketing etc. are required to be captured in the resale price
margin.
19\. Undisputedly, these costs are qua unrelated parties and to our mind,
these activities are not linked to the international transactions entered into
between the taxpayer and the AEs as the AEs do not have any control on such
activities and the answer to the question is to be found in case law relied
upon by the taxpayer as under.
20\. Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in Horiba India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT \-
(2017) 81 taxmann.com 209 (Delhi-Trib.) while deciding the identical issue as
to whether RPM or TNMM is the most appropriate method to determine ALP of
international transactions in case of distribution of marketing activities by
relied upon the decision rendered by Hon'ble Mumbai High Court in L'oreal
India PVt. Ltd. in ITA No.1046 of 2012, decisions of the Tribunal in Nokia
India (P) Ltd. - (2015) 167 TTJ 243 (Del.) and Mattel Toys (I.)(P.) Ltd. vs.
DCIT \- (2013) 34 taxmann.com 203 and decided the issue in favour of the
assessee by returning following findings :-
> "14. From the aforesaid decision it is quite ostensible that in case of a
> distributor, wherein the goods are purchased from AE and resold to other
> independent entities without any value addition, then resale price method
> should be reckoned as MAM. One of the main reason given by the TPO as well
> as the DRP is  20 ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA
> No.7088/Del./2017 that the assessee is a full-fledged/full risk distributor
> and performing host of functions, therefore, RPM should not be taken us the
> MAM, because all these functions required huge cost which may not represent
> correct gross profit margin. We are unable to appreciate such proposition,
> because in a comparable uncontrolled transactions scenario, a normal
> distributor will undertake all kind of functions which are related to sales
> of the product. The functions like market research, sales and marketing,
> ware-housing, inventory control, quality control etc. and also risk like
> market risk, inventory risk, credit risk etc all are undertaken by any
> distributor for sale of products. No comparable instances have been brought
> either by the TPO or by the Ld. DRP that the other distributors are not

> any value addition or not on the goods purchased for resale? If there is no
> value addition and if the finished goods which are purchased from AE are
> resold in the market as it is, then gross profit margin earned on such
> transaction becomes the determinative factor to analyse the gross
> compensation after the cost of sales. Thus, we hold that under the facts of
> the present case, RPM should be held as MAM."
21\. Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in ACIT vs. Kobelco Construction
Equipment India Ltd. - 186 TTJ 790 also decided the identical issue by relying
upon Mattel Toys (I.)(P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT (supra) and L'oreal India P. Ltd. -
(2012) 24 taxmann.com 192, in favour of the assessee by returning following
findings :-
> "13. The aforesaid decision clearly clinches the issue that under the RPM,
> the focus is more on same or similar nature of properties or services rather
> than similarity of products and functional attribute is a primary factor
> while undertaking the comparability analysis under RPM. Further, RPM is
> mostly applied in the case of a distributor where reseller purchases
> tangible property and obtains services from the AE and without making any
> value addition, resells the same to third parties. Under these circumstances
> and looking to the fact that functions performed by the assessee is of
> distributor only, therefore, RPM should be reckoned as the most appropriate
> method and accordingly, we agree with the learned CIT(A) that on  21 ITA
> No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 the facts of
> the present case, RPM should be the adopted as the most appropriate method
> for benchmarking assessee's international transactions. So far as the two
> comparables chosen by the TPO apart from assessee's comparables are
> concerned, we find that, T & I Global Limited has rightly been rejected by
> learned CIT(A), because this company was manufacturing machinery, therefore,
> same cannot be compared 15 ITA-6401/Del/2012 with the assessee which is
> purely performing the distribution function. Thus, the final list of
> comparables, i.e., three chosen by the assessee and accepted by the TPO and
> one as selected by the TPO and upheld by the learned CIT(A), is sustained
> for comparing the margins under RPM. As a consequence, we hold that the TP
> adjustment made by the learned TPO has rightly been deleted by Ld CIT(A).
> Accordingly, the grounds raised by the Revenue are dismissed."
22\. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case and following the
decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Mumbai High Court in L'oreal India PVt. Ltd.
in ITA No.1046 of 2012 (supra) and the decisions of the Coordinate Bench of
the Tribunal in Horiba India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT , Nokia India (P) Ltd., Mattel
Toys (I.)(P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, and ACIT vs. Kobelco Construction Equipment India
Ltd (supra), we are of the considered view that in case finished goods are
purchased by the taxpayer from its AE ready to be sold in the market without
any value addition then Resale Price Method (RPM) is the MAM to benchmark the
international transactions.
23\. So, findings returned by TPO/DRP that the taxpayer being a full-fledged
risk bearing distributor performing numerous  22 ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA
No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 functions, RPM is not the MAM, is not
sustainable for the reason that in a comparable uncontrolled transaction,
normally distributor requires to carry out all the functions necessary to
enhance the sales like market research, inventory risk, credit risk etc.. In
such circumstances, no comparable instances have been brought on record by the
TPO/DRP. So, when finished goods purchased by the taxpayer are resold in the
market without any value addition, then gross margin earned on such
transaction is the only determinative factor to analyse gross compensation
after the cost of sale. So, we are of the considered view that RPM in this
case is the MAM to bench mark the international transactions. In these
circumstances, addition made by the TPO/AO merely by disputing the method
applied by the taxpayer is not sustainable in the eyes of law. Method for
benchmarking the international transaction cannot be changed merely because of
the fact that the taxpayer has suffered loss at the net level but has positive
gross profit in trading segment as it depends on host of circumstances. So,
Grounds No.4, 5 & 6 in ITA No.1674/Del./2016 (AY : 2011-12) & ITA
No.1982/Del./2017 (AY : 2012-13) and Grounds No.3, 4 & 5 in ITA
No.7088/Del./2017 (AY : 2013-14) are determined in favour of the taxpayer.
23 ITA No.1674/Del./2016
ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 GROUND NO.7 IN ITA
No.1674/Del./2016 (AY : 2011-12)
24\. Ground No.7 in ITA No.1674/Del/2016 for AY 2011-12 is dismissed having
not been pressed during the course of arguments. GROUNDS NO.8, 9, 10 & 11 IN
ITA No.1674/Del./2016 (AY : 2011-12) GROUNDS NO.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12 IN ITA
No.1982/Del./2017 (AY : 2012-13) GROUNDS NO.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12 IN ITA
No.7088/Del./2017 (AY : 2013-14)
25\. Undisputedly, the TPO has not made any adjustment on account of
Advertisement, Marketing & Promotion (AMP) expenses. The ld. DRP directed the
TPO to make adjustment on account of AMP expenses by treating the same as
separate international transactions. It is the case of the taxpayer that since
the AMP expenses incurred by the taxpayer is not international transactions
and bright line test cannot be accepted to benchmark the international
transactions of AMP, the addition is not sustainable and relied upon the
decision of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. vs. CIT - ITA No.110 of 2014 & 710 of
2015, Yum Restaurants (India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. ITO - ITA No.349 of 2015, CIT  24
ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 vs.
Whirlpool of India Ltd. - ITA No.610/2014 and Bausch & Lomb Eyecare (India)
(P.) Ltd. vs. ACIT - ITA No.643, 675 to 677 of 2014, 165, 166 & 950 of 2015.
26\. However, on the other hand, to repel the arguments of the ld. AR for the
taxpayer, the ld. DR for the Revenue contended that since the taxpayer is a
distributor, it is covered by the decision of Hon'ble High Court in case of
Sony Ericson - ITA No.16 of 2014.
27\. However, without going into the merits of the case, when we examine
letter dated December 29, 2015 written by the taxpayer to the ld. DRP, no
opportunity of being heard has been given to the taxpayer before making ALP
adjustment on account of AMP expenses. For ready perusal, operative part of
the letter (supra) is extracted as under :-
> "The Hon'ble Panel has asked furnish certain information. In this regard,
> the Assessee submits as follows:
> Explain as to why ratio of GP/Sales (gross profit/ operating revenue) shall
> not be used instead PLR for benchmarking the international transaction of
> advertisement, marketing and promotional ("AMP") in the Assessee's case and
> explain as to why the advertisement expenses excluded by applying bright-
> line should not be taken as part of AMP expenses.
> In this regard, at the outset, the Assessee would like to submit that the
> Learned Transfer Pricing Officer ('Ld. TPO) in its Order dated January 07,
> 2015 passed u/s 92CA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ("the Act"), has not  25
> ITA No.1674/Del./2016 ITA No.1982/Del./2017 ITA No.7088/Del./2017 made any
> adjustment on account of excessive spend by the Assessee on AMP. Further,
> this issue was also not discussed eluting the hearing held before the
> Hon'ble Panel on December 14, 2015.
> However, in case the Hon'ble Panel wishes to analyse the marketing
> intangible/AMP issue at this stage, the Assessee seeks a reasonable
> opportunity to present its case in line with the principle of natural
> justice.
          In case your honour's require any                    other
          information/clarifications,    the     Assessee      would
> appropriately respond at the earliest."
28\. Bare perusal of the aforesaid letter dated 29.12.2015, undisputedly
received by the ld. DRP, goes to prove that when letter (supra) issued by the
taxpayer seeking opportunity to explain the query raised by the ld. DRP but
the ld. DRP without affording any opportunity of being heard, ld. DRP has
passed the impugned order on 30.12.2015. So, ld. DRP being a quasi-judicial
authority is under legal obligation to afford an opportunity of being heard to
the taxpayer before passing any order. In these circumstances, TP adjustment
made by the ld. DRP/TPO/AO on account of AMP expenses is not sustainable,
hence the issue is remitted back to the TPO to decide afresh after providing
an opportunity of being heard to the taxpayer.
