provision in the Act and therefore, the Respondents had no authority to levy
service tax on the members of the Petitioners-association.

Respondents are restrained from levying service tax from the members of the

DATED: 11TH DECEMBER, 2008 JUDGMENT: (PER D.K.DESHMUKH, J.)
1\. By this Petition the Petitioners challenge the constitutional validity of
the following:-
> (i) Section 66A of the Finance Act, 1994;
> (hereinafter referred to as the "Act for the sake of brevity), which has
> been introduced with effect from 18th April, 2006;

2\. On the basis of the above provisions the  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013

\- 3 -
Respondents are seeking to levy and recover service tax from the persons
resident in India on the services which are rendered and/or performed out side
India by non-resident service providers. By the aforementioned provisions
although the services are performed out side India, the tax is sought to be
levied and collected from the recipient of these services, who is based in
India.
3\. The Petitioner No.1 is the Indian National Ship Owners Association which
is registered as a not-for-profit company under Section 25 of the Companies
Act, 1956, and whose members are owners of Indian Flag Vessels. Currently, the
Petitioner No.1 has 32 members with a combined gross registered tonnage of 7.2
million tonnes, which represents 90% of the total Indian tonnage. The
Petitioner No.2 is a National and Citizen of India and is a shareholder of
various companies which are members of Petitioner No.1, inter alia, engaged in
the operation of ships.
4\. In the petition, though the Petitioners challenge constitutional validity
of Section 66A of the Act, at the outset, the learned Counsel appearing for
the Petitioners stated that he does not press for the  ::: Downloaded on -

reliefs sought in relation to Section 66A of the Act.
        The    learned        Counsel submitted that from             1994      till
        2002    there      is    no demand of service          tax      from      the
        members      of the Petitioners.        Demand for service                tax
        was         made        by     the         members            of          the
        Petitioners-Association            for the period from 1-3-2002
        till 16-6-2005 and from 17-6-2005 till date.                       But the
        Petitioners        are    restricting their challenge to                  the
        demand      of    service    tax    from    the      members         of     the
        Petitioner        No.1-Association      till       18-4-2006            when
        Section      66A
                              was incorporated in the Act.              In     other
words, the Petitioners by this petition now challenge only levy of service tax
from 1-3-2002 till 18-4-2006 when Section 66-A came into force.
5\. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners submitted that though
the service tax was introduced for the first time in the Chapter V of the
Finance Act, 1994 in the year 1997 the definition of the term "taxable
service" was substantially amended.
According to the Petitioners, the Indian Shipping Industry is obliged by
Statute under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 and in terms
of the normal conditions of trade, to obtain and consume outside India, the
services listed hereunder.

        Petitioners-association             outside India are concerned,
        according        to    the   Petitioners     till      the      month       of
        February,        2002    there was no demand of           service         tax
made from the members of the Petitioners-association.
It is submitted by the Petitioners that the demand was not probably made from
the members of the Petitioners-association, because as per the provisions of
Section 64 of the Act, the Chapter extended to whole of India except the State
of Jammu & Kashmir, therefore, the services rendered outside India was not to
be taxed. The Petitioners pointed  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 6 -
out that a question arose as to whether service tax is leviable in relation to
the services provided outside Indian territorial water, and therefore, a
circular was issued by the Government of India dated 8-10-2001. That circular
reads as under:-
> Service Tax Circular No.36/4/2001 dated 8-10-2001 Government of India
> Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue) Central Board of Excise &
> Customs, New Delhi I am directed to say that question has arisen whether
> services provided outside the limits of the Indian territorial waters are
> liable to Service Tax or not.
> The matter has been examined. At present the levy of service tax extends to
> the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The expression
> "India" includes the territorial waters of India. Indian territorial extend
> up to twelve nautical miles from the Indian land mass. Chapter V of the
> Finance Act which governs the levy of Service Tax has not extended to the

Thus, it was clarified by the aforesaid circular that services provided beyond
the territorial waters of  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 7 -
India are not liable to service tax, as provisions of service tax have not
been extended to such area so far. On 1st March,2002 a notification was issued
by which provisions of Chapter V of the Act were extended to the continental
shelf and exclusive Economic Zone of India. The notification dated 1st March,
2002 reads as under:-
> Notification: 1/2002-ST dated 1-March-2002 In exercise of the powers
> conferred by clause
> (a) of sub-section (6) of section 6, and clause (a) of sub-section (7) of

> July 1986 and S.O.643 (E), dated 19th September, 1996 with immediate effect.
It is after issuance of this notification that for the first time demand of
service tax was made from the members of the Petitioners-association in
relation to the services received by them outside India even beyond the
continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. Thus, so far as that period is
concerned, the learned Counsel appearing for the  ::: Downloaded on -

\- 8 -
Petitioners submitted that the services are rendered to vessels and ships of
the members of the Petitioners-association beyond even continental shelf and
exclusive economic zone. The learned Counsel further submitted that on
31-12-2004 a notification was issued by the Government of India in exercise of
its power under sub-section 2 of Section 68 of the Act, and therefore, the
demand of service tax was made from the members of the Petitioners-association
in relation to the services received by them to their vessels and ships
outside of India on the basis of the notification dated 31-12-2004 from
1-1-2005.
Notification dated 31-12-2004 reads as under.
Notification:36/2004-S.T. dated 31-Dec-2004 "In exercise of the powers
conferred by sub-section (2) of section 68 of the Finance Act, 1994 (32 of
1994), the Central Government hereby notifies the following taxable services
for the purposes of the said sub-section, namely:-
(A) the services:-
(i) in relation to a telephone connection or pager or a communication through
telegraph or telex or a facsimile communication or a leased circuit;
(ii) in relation to general insurance business;
(iii) in relation to insurance auxiliary  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013

\- 9 -
service by an insurance agent; and
(iv) in relation to transport of goods by road in a goods carriage, where the
consignor or consignee of goods is,-
(a) any factory registered under or governed by the Factories Act, 1948 (63 of
1948);
(b) any company established by or under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);
(c) any corporation established by or under the law;
(d) any society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of
1860) or under any law corresponding to that Act in force in any part of
India;
(e) any co-operative society established or under any law;
by
(f) any dealer of excisable goods, who is registered under the Central Excise
Act, 1944 (1 of 1944) or the rules made thereunder; or
(g) any body corporate established, or a partnership firm registered, by or
under any law;
(B) any taxable service provided by a person who is a non-resident or is from
outside India, does not have any office in India.
2\. This notification shall come into force on the first day of January, 2005.
7\. The learned Counsel submitted that reading of sub-section 2 of Section 68
and this notification along with the scheme of the Act shows that under this
notification the recipients of service cannot be made liable for levy of
service tax. The learned  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 10 -
Counsel further submitted that on 16-6-2000 the Service Tax Rules 1994 were
amended and a provision was added in Rule (2), which reads as under:-
> (iv) in relation to any taxable service provided or to be provided by a
> person, who has established a business or has a fixed establishment from
> which the service is provided or to be provided, or has his permanent
> address or usual place of residence, in a country other than India, and such
> service provider does not have any office in India, the person who receives
> such service and has his place of business, fixed establishment, permanent
> address or, as the case may be, usual place of residence, in India.
By this provision while defining the term "person liable to pay service tax" a
person who has received services outside India was made liable for levy of
service tax. The learned Counsel submits that provision of Rule 2(d)(iv)
quoted above is invalid, because it is contrary to the scheme of the Act. On
16-6-2005, an amendment was made to the Act also, by which an explanation was
added below Section 65(105).
Which explanation reads as under:-
> Explanation- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where any
> service provided or to be provided by a person, who has established a
> business or has a fixed establishment from which the service is provided or
> to be provided, or has his permanent address or usual place of  :::

> be received by a person who has his place of business, fixed establishment,
> permanent address or, as the case may be, usual place of residence, in
> India, such service shall be deemed to be taxable service for the purposes

8\. The learned Counsel submits that by this explanation services provided by
a person who does not have permanent residence in India to a person having
present permanent residence in India is deemed to be taxable service. But by
this explanation levy of not provided for.
service tax from the recipients of the service The learned Counsel submits
that is thus the levy of service tax from the members of the Petitioners-
Association with effect from 16-6-2005 was on the basis of the explanation and
the provision of Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) quoted above. The learned Counsel submits
that the provisions of Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) are invalid and under the explanation
service tax cannot be levied from the members of the Petitioners-association,
who have received services to their vessels and ships outside India. With
effect from 18-4-2006 Section 66-A was added to the Act. Which reads as
under:-
"(1) 66A (1) Where any service specified  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
14:08:25 :::
\- 12 -
in clause (105) of section 65 is, -
(a) provided or to be provided by a person who has established a business or
has a fixed establishment from which the service is provided or to be provided
or has his permanent address or usual place of residence, in a country other
than India, and
(b) received by a person (hereinafter referred to as the recipient) who has
his place of business, fixed establishment, permanent address or usual place
of residence in India, such service shall, for the purposes of this section,
be the taxable service, and such taxable service shall be treated as if the
recipient had himself provided the service in India and accordingly all the
provisions of this Chapter shall apply;
Provided that where the recipient of the service is an individual and such
service received by him is otherwise than for the purpose of use in any
business or commerce, the provisions of this sub-section shall not apply;
Provided further that where the provider of the service has his business
establishment both in that country and elsewhere, the country, where the
establishment of the provider of service directly concerned with the provision
of service is located, shall be treated as the country from which the service
is provided or to be provided.
(2) Where a person is carrying on a business through a permanent establishment
in India and through another permanent establishment in a country other than
India, such permanent establishments shall be treated as separate persons for
the purposes of this section.
Explanation 1.- A person carrying on a business through a branch or agency in
any country shall be treated as having a business establishment in that
country.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 13 -
Explanation 2.- Usual place of residence, in relation to a body corporate,
means the place where it is incorporated or otherwise legally constituted."
9\. The learned Counsel submits that it is only from 18-4-2006 that a
substitute provision was made for levy of service tax from a person who
receives service outside India. Thus, according to the learned Counsel, before
18-4-2006 no service tax could have been levied on the members of the
Petitioners-association whose vessels and ships receive service outside India.
Though the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners submitted that
service tax is sought to be levied from the members of the Petitioners-
association from 1-3-2002, in the written submission filed on behalf of the
Respondents there does not appear to be any justification given for levying
service tax from the members of the Petitioners-association whose vessels and
ships receive services outside India.
10\. In the written submission filed on behalf of the Respondents reliance is
placed on the provisions of Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) of the Rules, which have come
into force from 16-8-2002 to claim that in view of those Rules service tax was
leviable. It was submitted  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 14 -
that it is unambiguously clear that a statutory effect had already been
created w.e.f. 16-8-2002, by an omnibus provision made by incorporating clause
(iv) in Rule 2(1)(d) of the Service Tax Rules under which every service
receiver in India became liable to pay Service Tax in relation any taxable
service provided by non-resident, who did not have office in India. This
statutory effect has to be read harmoniously as if complementing the
provisions of Section 68(2) as it existed prior to issue of Notification
36/2004-ST, dated 31-12-2004 rather than negating its existence or challenging
its vires since the date of its incorporation, i.e. 1-8-2002. The statutory
effect created vide rule 2(1)(d)(iv) cannot be reduced by reference to a
subsequently issued notification repeating the contents of the said rule.
It was further submitted that in respect of the recipient of services who have
been made liable to pay service tax on services received from foreign based
persons, there is no denying the fact that the recipients of these services
are the ultimate beneficiaries of the services rendered to them.
Moreover, in the case of an indirect tax, it is the recipient of service who
has to ultimately bear the incidence of a tax. Thus, the liability cast upon
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 15 -
the recipient of service has a direct connection with him and there exists a
direct nexus between recipient of these services from foreign based service
provider and the Indian Union.
11\. The learned Counsel appearing for both sides relied on the judgment of
the Supreme Court in the case of Laghu Udyog Bharati v/s. Union of India, 1999
(112) E.L.T. 365 (S.C.) and the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
Gujarat Ambuja Cements  Ltd. v/s. Union of India, 2005(182) E.L.T. 33 (S.C.).
The Petitioners in this petition are challenging levy of service tax from the
members of the Petitioners-association in relation to the services rendered to
the vessels and ships owned by the members of the Petitioners-association
outside India from 1-3-2002 to 17-4-2006.
12\. Article 265 of the Constitution of India lays down that "no tax shall be
levied or collected except by authority of law". Therefore, an enquiry that is
to be made is whether during the period from 1-3-2002 to 17-4-2006 there was
valid law which authorises levy of service tax in relation to the services
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 16 -
rendered outside India.
13\. Service tax was introduced for the first time under Chapter V of Finance
Act 1994. Section 66 of the Act was the charging section and provided for a
levy of service tax at the rate of 5% of the value of the taxable service
provided to any person by the persons responsible for collecting the service
tax.
In other words, the levy was on the provider of the taxable service. "Taxable
service" is defined in Section 65 to include only three services namely any
service provided to an investor by a stock-borker, to a subscriber by the
telegraph authority and to a policy holder by an insurer carrying on general
insurance business. Section 68 requires every person providing the taxable
service to collect the service tax at the specified rate. Section 69 of the
Finance Act 1994 provided for the registration of a person responsible for
collecting service tax. Sub-section 2 of Section 5 indicated that it was
provider of the service who was responsible for collecting the tax and oblige
to get registered. Thus, sections 65, 66, 68 and 69 are pertinent to the
present issue. They were subsequently amended. The remaining sections of the
1994 Act substantially continued as originally  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
14:08:25 :::
\- 17 -
enacted with minor changes. Under Section 70 of the Finance Act, 1994 every
person responsible for collecting service tax must furnish to the Central
Excise Officer in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner a
clear return. Sections 71, 72, 73 and 74 deal with the filing of the returns,
provision for assessment, reopening of assessment and rectification of mistake
in assessment order.
        Section      75    provides for payment of interest at                     the
        rate    of one and one and half per cent for the                        every
        month    or    part
                                 of    a   month    by    which      the      person
        responsible        for    collecting       service tax         delays        in
        paying      tax to the credit of the Central                 Government.
        Section      76    deals with exemption of the penalty                     for
        failure to collect the service tax.                 Section 77 deals
        with     the      penalty      for     failure     to    furnish           the
        prescribed return.            Section 78 deals with the penalty
        for    suppression        the value of the         taxable        service.
        Section      79 deals with penalty for failure to                     comply
        with    notice.         Section      94 of the Act       empowers          the
Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions for Chapter V
of the Act. Pursuant to such powers the Service Tax Rules 1994 were framed.
14\. In this petition we are concerned with the  ::: Downloaded on -

\- 18 -
provisions of Section 65(105), which defines the taxable service. By that
provision a service provided to a ship or vessel was defined to be taxable
service.
15\. The charge of service tax in respect of service rendered to a ship or
vessel remains on the person responsible for collecting the service tax under
Section 66 of the Act. Section 66 reads as under:-
> "66. There ig shall be levied a tax (hereinafter referred to as the service
> tax) at the rate of twelve per cent of the value of taxable services
> referred to in sub-clause
> (a), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k), (l), (m),

> (zzzzd), (zzzze), (zzzzf), (zzzzg), (zzzzh), (zzzzi) and (zzzzj) of clause
> (105) of Section 65 and collected in the manner as may be prescribed."
Thus, the service tax can be levied at the rate of 12% of the value of the
taxable service. Then comes Section 68, which lays down that every person  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 19 -
providing taxable service to any person shall collect the service tax at the
rate specified in section 66.
It is clear from reading of these provisions that according to scheme of the
Finance Act, as it existed before 18-4-2006, the charge of service tax is on
the person who is responsible for collecting the service tax. It is by virtue
of the provisions of Section 65 the person who provides the service is
regarded as the assessee.
16\. Now, so far as the notification dated 1st March, 2002 quoted above which
is relied on for justifying levy of service tax from 1-3-2002 is concerned,
perusal of that notification shows that by that notification service which is
rendered or provided in the Continental Shelf Exclusive Economic Zone and
Territorial Waters of India has been made taxable.
That notification does not have the effect of levying service tax on the
recipients of the service.
Therefore, levy of service tax on the members of the Petitioners-association
on the basis of notification dated 1st March, 2002 is plainly without
authority of law.
17\. Reliance is placed on the provisions of Rule  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 20 -
2(1)(d)(iv) quoted above for justifying the levy of service tax for the period
from 16-8-2002. Perusal of the above quoted Rule 2(d)(iv) shows that by that
provision a person liable for paying the service tax was defined to mean in
relation to any taxable service provided by a person who is non-resident or is
from outside India to a person receiving taxable service in India. Apart from
the fact that this rule is contrary to the provisions of Section 68 and other
provisions of the Act, under this provision the recipient of the service
became liable for paying the service tax provided the service was received in
India. The entire case of the Petitioners is in relation to the service
received by the vessels and ships owned by the members of the Petitioner-
association outside India. Therefore, it cannot be said that on the basis of
Rule 2(1)(d)(iv), service tax can be levied on the members of the Petitioners-
association. It is further to be seen here that Section 64 gives powers to the
Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the
Chapter. The chapter relates to taxing the services which are provided, the
taxing on the value of the service and it is only the person who is providing
the service can be regarded as an  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 21 -
assessee. The rules therefore, cannot be so framed as not to carry the purpose
of the Chapter and cannot be conflicted with the provisions in Chapter V of
the Act. In other words, as the Act makes the person who is providing the
service liable, the provisions in the Rules cannot be made which makes the
recipient of the service liable. It is, thus, clear that the provisions of
Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) are clearly invalid.
18\. So far as reliance placed on the notification dated 31-12-2004 for
justifying levy of service tax from the members of the Petitioners-association
is concerned, that notification has been issued under sub-section (2) of
Section 68 of the Act.
Sub-section 2 of Section 68 reads as under:-
> 68(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in respectof
> any taxable service notified by the Central Government in the Official
> Gazette, the service tax thereon shall be paid by such person and in such
> manner as may be prescribed at the rate specified in section 66 and all the
> provisions of this Chapter shall apply to such person as if he is the person
> liable for paying the service tax in relation to such service.
The above provision authorises the Central Government to notify the taxable
service, in relation to which the rules can be framed, in relation to such
service.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 22 -
By the notification dated 31-12-2004, any taxable service provided by a person
who is a non-resident or is from outside India is notified. If Rule 2(d)(iv)
is taken to be rule framed pursuant to this provision, then a person who
receives taxable service in India from a person who is non-resident or is from
outside India becomes taxable and not service rendered outside India by a
person who is non-resident or is from outside India. Therefore, levy of
service tax from the members of the Petitioners-association ig from 1-2-2005
cannot be justified.
19\. Then reliance is placed on explanation which is added below Section
65(105). That explanation was added by Finance Act, 2005 with effect from
16-6-2005. That explanation reads as under:-
> Explanation- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that where any
> service provided or to be provided by a person, who has established a
> business or has a fixed establishment from which the service is provided or
> to be provided, or has his permanent address or usual place of residence, in
> a country other than India and such service is received or to be received by
> a person who has his place of business, fixed establishment, permanent
> address or, as the case may be, usual place of residence, in India, such
> service shall be deemed to be taxable service for the purposes of this  :::
> Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
> \- 23 -
> clause.
By this explanation services provided by a non-resident outside India to a
person residing in India has been declared to be taxable service.
Therefore, though the services provided to the members of the Petitioners-
Association outside India becomes taxable service, the charge of the tax
continues to be on the provider of service as per the scheme of the Act, and
because of the explanation also the Respondents do not get authority of law to
levy a service ig tax in relation to the services rendered to the vessels and
ships of the members of the Petitioners-association outside India.
20\. It appears that a similar provision in the rules was made applicable by
the Government in relation to the Clearing Agents by making customers of the
Clearing Agent liable for levy of the service tax.
That question has been decided by the Supreme Court by its judgment in the
case of Laghu Udyog Bharati (supra) and the Supreme Court has clearly laid
down that the imposition of the service tax is on the persons rendering the
services and by making a provision in the Rules, levy of tax cannot be shifted
to the recipients of the services and the Rule framed  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 14:08:25 :::
\- 24 -
which brought about this situation has been declared by the Supreme Court to
be invalid. The law laid down by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Laghu
Udyog (supra) is squarely applicable to Rule 2(1)(d)(iv), which is relied on
in this case. It appears that it is first time when the Act was amended and
Section 66A was inserted by Finance Act, 2006 w.e.f.18-4-2006, the Respondents
got legal authority to levy service tax on the recipients of the taxable
service. Now, because of the enactment of Section 66A, a person who is
resident in India or business in India becomes liable to be levied service tax
when he receives service outside India from a person who is non-resident or is
from outside India.
Before enactment of Section 66A it is apparent that there was no authority
vested by law in the Respondents to levy service tax on a person who is
resident in India, but who receives services outside India. In that case till
Section 66-A was enacted a person liable was the one who rendered the
services.
In otherwords, it is only after enactment of Section 66-A that taxable
services received from abroad by a person belonging to India are taxed in the
hands of the Indian residents. In such cases, the Indian recipient of the
taxable services is deemed to be a  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:08:25
:::
\- 25 -
service provider. Before enactment of Section 66-A, there was no such
provision in the Act and therefore, the Respondents had no authority to levy
service tax on the members of the Petitioners-association.
21\. In the result, therefore, the petition succeeds and is allowed.
Respondents are restrained from levying service tax from the members of the
Petitioners-association for the period from 1-3-2002 till 17-4-2006, in
relation to the services received by the vessels ig and ships of the members
of the Petitioners-association outside India, from persons who are non-
residents of India and are from outside India.
22\. Rule made absolute accordingly. No order as to costs.
