15\. We are of the view, therefore, that the law on this issue is quite well
settled. Where an application for rectification/cancellation of a registered
trade mark is pending before the statutory authority, the High Court is
obliged to stay further proceedings in the suit pending before it pursuant to
Section 124(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
16\. In so far as the suit out of which present appeal arises is concerned,
there is an allegation against the Appellants of passing off the trade mark
`Plasto‟ as well as `Non-Dust‟ and there is an allegation of infringement of
the trade mark `Non-Dust‟.
17\. In view of the express provisions of Section 124 of Trade Marks Act, we
stay further proceedings in the suit in so far as the alleged infringement is
concerned with regard to the trade mark `Non-Dust‟ until the disposal of the
matter before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. It is, however, made
clear that the passing off action may continue.

    MADAN B. LOKUR, J. (ORAL)
1\. The Appellants are aggrieved by an order dated 1st May, 2009 passed by a
learned Single Judge in IA No.15842/2008 in CS (OS) No.476/2004. FAO(OS)
296/2009 Page 1 of 7
2\. The Respondent had filed a suit alleging that the Appellants are passing
off its goods as those of the Respondent.
3\. During the pendency of the suit, the trade mark which was relied upon by
the Respondent, that is, `Non-Dust‟ was registered with the Registrar of Trade
Marks.
4\. The Appellants objected to the registration of the trade mark „Non-Dust‟
and filed a rectification/cancellation application which is still pending with
the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. These facts are not disputed by
either of the parties.
5\. After filing the application for rectification/cancellation, the
Appellants moved an application before the learned Single Judge under Section
124 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 for a stay of the suit with regard to the
alleged infringement. Section 124 (1) of the Act which is material for our
purposes reads as follows:-
> "124. Stay of proceedings where the validity of registration of the trade
> mark is questioned, etc.-(1) Where in any suit for infringement of a trade
> mark-
> (a) the defendant pleads that registration of the plaintiff‟s trade mark is
> invalid ; or
> (b) the defendant raises a defence under clause (e) of sub-section (2) of
> section 30 and the plaintiff pleads the invalidity of registration of the
> defendant‟s trade mark, the court trying the suit (hereinafter referred to
> as the court), shall,-
FAO(OS) 296/2009 Page 2 of 7
> (i) if any proceedings for rectification of the register in relation to the
> plaintiff‟s or defendant‟s trade mark are pending before the Registrar or
> the Appellate Board, stay the suit pending the final disposal of such
> proceedings;
> (ii) if no such proceedings are pending and the court is satisfied that the
> plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff‟s or
> defendant‟s trade mark is prima facie tenable, raise an issue regarding the
> same and adjourn the case for a period of three months from the date of the
> framing of the issue in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the
> Appellate Board for rectification of the register."
6\. A plain reading of the above would show that in any suit, which in our
opinion means a pending suit, if an application is moved for rectification/
cancellation of a registered trade mark, the Court is obliged to stay the suit
in so far as the cause of action pertaining to infringement is concerned.
7\. A similar provision existed under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,
1958 being Section 111 thereof and that came up for interpretation in two
cases before different learned Single Judges of this Court.
8\. In the first case that is Chandra Bhan Dembla Trading, Delhi v. Bharat
Sewing Machine Co., Bikaner, AIR 1982 Delhi 230, a composite suit was filed
for infringement of a trade mark and for passing off. The learned Single Judge
observed in paragraph 4 of the Report that once rectification/cancellation
proceedings are initiated, the suit in the High Court is liable to be stayed:
> "As for the question of stay, the position appears to be quite simple. Both
> the parties are registered owners of the identical trademarks. The
> trademarks in favour of one are under challenge by the other. Rectification
> proceedings in respect of the FAO(OS) 296/2009 Page 3 of 7 trademark
> „Sainik‟ in favour of the plaintiff were pending before the Registrar of
> Trademarks, New Delhi, even before the institution of the suit and the
> factum of pendency is admitted in the plaint in terms. The proceedings for
> the rectification of registration in respect of „Harsha‟ were filed
> subsequently and are pending in this Court. Plaintiff has also admittedly
> challenge the subsisting registration in favour of the defendants and these
> are pending in this Court. True, one of the rectification proceedings was
> filed subsequent to the institution of the suit but in view of sub-sec. (2)
> of S. 111 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, once such
> proceedings are filed, for the purpose of stay the fact that they are
> subsequent to the suit would be immaterial. In view of the contest between
> the parties with regard to the validity of the registration of each other,
> it is reasonable and proper that the suit is stayed u/s 111 of the Act."
9\. Similarly, in M/s Elofix Industries (India) v M/s Steel Bird Industries,
AIR 1985 Delhi 258, in composite proceedings for alleged infringement and
passing off the learned Single Judge in paragraph 5 of the Report came to the
conclusion that the suit is liable to be stayed:
> "It is not disputed that after the service of the summons in the present
> suit, the defendants filed their written statement on 14- 9-1983 and
> simultaneously filed C. O. No. 17/1983, a petition under Ss. 107, 46 and 56
> of the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act for the rectification of the plaintiffs
> trade Mark No. 252967-B in Class 7, dated. 7-11-1968. S. 111 seeks to
> prevent parallel enquiries in the same matter. The intention of the
> Legislature is that the Court trying the suit must wait for the result of
> rectification proceedings before it passes any final order or decree
> involving the validity of the registration. Instead of requiring the Court
> to raise as issue regarding the invalidity of the plaintiff's registration
> of the trade mark, the defendant filed the rectification proceedings. In my
> opinion this is a substantial compliance with the provisions of clause (B)
> (ii) of sub-section 1 of S. 111 of the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act. Even
> otherwise under S. 151 of the Code P.C. this Court under its inherent powers
> can grant the stay of the action of the plaintiff, as no useful purpose
> would be served by proceeding FAO(OS) 296/2009 Page 4 of 7 with the case
> while the plaintiff's trade mark is in jeopardy and the outcome of the
> rectification proceedings is awaited."
10\. We see no reason to differ with the view taken by two learned Single
Judges of this Court on a plain reading of Section 111 of the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 which is in pari materia with Section 124 of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999.
11\. Learned counsel for the Respondent, however, drew our attention to
Bhavnesh Mohanlal Amin and Anr. v. Nirma Chemicals Works Ltd. and Anr., JT
2005 (10) SC 232 to contend that it is not obligatory that the suit should be
stayed pending rectification/cancellation proceedings. In this context, he
drew our attention to paragraph 16 of the Report which is as follows:
> "It is pointed out by learned counsel for the respondents that since the
> appellants have moved for action in terms of Section 111 of the Trade and
> Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (in short the 'Old Act') corresponding to
> Section 124 of the Act there is no scope for proceeding in the suit further.
> Learned Counsel for the parties agreed that an early disposal of the matter
> would be in the interest of the parties. Learned Counsel for the appellants
> fairly stated that the question relating to bar of jurisdiction in terms of
> Section 111 of the Old Act corresponding to Section 124 of the New Act shall
> not be raised and the trial court would be free to proceed with the suit."
12\. On a reading of the above paragraph, we find that it is quite clearly
stated that both learned counsel appearing in the Supreme Court had agreed
that early disposal of the matter would be in the interest of the parties.
Learned counsel for the appellants in the Supreme Court stated that the
question relating to the bar of jurisdiction under Section 111 of the Trade
and Merchandise Marks Act FAO(OS) 296/2009 Page 5 of 7 (corresponding to
Section 124 of the Trade Marks Act) shall not be raised and the trial court
would be free to proceed with the suit.
13\. In view of the above, we find that the judgment referred to by learned
counsel is not at all relevant to this case since it has proceeded on a
concession that the bar of jurisdiction would not be raised.
14\. Our attention has also been drawn to Arun Colour Chem & Ors. v. Mithumal
Essance Mart & Anr., 2009 VII AD (Delhi) 581. In our opinion, the passages
relied upon by learned counsel, that is paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Report do
not support his case at all but in fact support the case of the Appellants. In
that case, the argument was that a stay should not be granted when the suit is
at the stage of final hearing. This was rejected by the learned Single Judge
who held that an order staying further proceedings in the suit can be passed
at any time during its pendency. This is what was said:
> "15. It was sought to be urged by Mr. Sushant Singh that normally an order
> staying the suit seeking permanent injunction for infringement of registered
> trade mark under Section 124 of the TM Act, 1999 is passed at an
> interlocutory stage and not when the suit is at the stage of final hearing.
> 16\. This Court is unable to agree with the above submission. The wording of
> Section 124 (1) does not indicate that an order staying the proceedings
> cannot be passed at any time before the disposal of the suit or that it can
> be passed only at an interlocutory stage. Moreover, when the applications
> for rectification have been filed by the Plaintiff only in October and
> December 2007, there is no occasion for this Court to have considered
> earlier whether the provisions of Section 124 of the TM Act stood attracted.
> It appears to this Court that there is no option but to stay the further
> proceedings in terms of Section 124 of the TM Act."

settled. Where an application for rectification/cancellation of a registered
trade mark is pending before the statutory authority, the High Court is
obliged to stay further proceedings in the suit pending before it pursuant to
Section 124(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
16\. In so far as the suit out of which present appeal arises is concerned,
there is an allegation against the Appellants of passing off the trade mark
`Plasto‟ as well as `Non-Dust‟ and there is an allegation of infringement of
the trade mark `Non-Dust‟.
17\. In view of the express provisions of Section 124 of Trade Marks Act, we
stay further proceedings in the suit in so far as the alleged infringement is
concerned with regard to the trade mark `Non-Dust‟ until the disposal of the
matter before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. It is, however, made
clear that the passing off action may continue.
18\. No further orders are required to be passed on this appeal. It is,
therefore, disposed of.
