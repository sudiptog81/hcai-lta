any other party or the receiver may apply to the judicial authority having
jurisdiction in the insolvency proceedings for an order directing that the
matter in question shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the

agreement, and a dispute arises to which the agreement applies, the Court, if
it is of opinion that in the circumstances of the case undue hardship would
otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the time so fixed has expired,
may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require, extend the
time for such period as it thinks proper.

CONVENTION ON THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS
ARTICLE I 1. This Convention shall apply to the recognition and enforcement of
arbitral awards made in the territory of a State other than the State where
the recognition and enforcement of such awards are sought, and arising out of
differences between persons, whether physical or legal. It shall also apply to
arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the State where their
recognition and enforcement are sought. 2. The term “arbitral awards” shall
include not only awards made by arbitrators appointed for each case but also
those made by permanent arbitral bodies to which the parties have submitted.
3. When signing, ratifying or acceding to this Convention, or notifying
extension under article X hereof, any State may on the basis of reciprocity
declare that it will apply the Convention to the recognition and enforcement
of awards made only in the territory of another Contracting State. It may also
declare that it will apply the Convention only to differences arising out of
legal relationships, whether contractual or not, which are considered as
commercial under the national law of the State making such declaration.
ARTICLE II 1. Each Contracting State shall recognise an agreement in writing
under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any
differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of
defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject-
matter capable of settlement by arbitration. 2. The term “agreement in
writing” shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration
agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or
telegrams. 3. The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a
matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the
meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer
the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null
and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed. ARTICLE III Each
Contracting State shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them
in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is
relied upon, under the conditions laid down in the following articles. There
shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or
charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this
Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of
domestic arbitral awards. ARTICLE IV 1. To obtain the recognition and
enforcement mentioned in the preceding article, the party applying for
recognition and enforcement shall, at the time of the application, supply— (a)
the duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof; (b)
the original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy
thereof. 2. If the said award or agreement is not made in an official language
of the country in which the award is relied upon, the party applying for
recognition and enforcement of the award shall produce a translation of these
documents into such language. The translation shall be certified by an
official or sworn translator or by a diplomatic or consular agent. ARTICLE V
1. Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of
the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the
competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof
that— (a) the parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under
the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is
not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any
indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or
(b) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of
the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was
otherwise unable to present his case; or (c) the award deals with a difference
not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to
arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the
submission to arbitration; provided that, if the decisions on matters
submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that
part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration
may be recognised and enforced; or (d) the composition of the arbitral
authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement
of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law
of the country where the arbitration took place; or (e) the award has not yet
become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a
competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that
award was made. 2. Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also
be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and
enforcement is sought finds that— (a) the subject-matter of the difference is
not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country; or (b)
the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public
policy of that country. ARTICLE VI If an application for the setting aside or
suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in
article V(1)(e), the authority before which the award is sought to be relied
upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement
of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming
enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.
ARTICLE VII 1. The provisions of the present Convention shall not affect the
validity of multilateral or bilateral agreements concerning the recognition
and enforcement of arbitral awards entered into by the Contracting States nor
deprive any interested party of any right he may have to avail himself of an
arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by the law or the
treaties of the country where such award is sought to be relied upon. 2. The
Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses of 1923 and the Geneva Convention on

Secretary-General of the United Nations and shall take effect as from the
ninetieth day after the day of receipt by the Secretary-General of the United
Nations of this notification, or as from the date of entry into force of the

provisions shall apply:— (a) with respect of those articles of this Convention
that come within the legislative jurisdiction of the federal authority, the
obligations of the federal Government shall to this extent be the same as
those of Contracting States which are not federal States; (b) with respect to
those articles of this Convention that come within the legislative

ARBITRATION CLAUSES The undersigned, being duly authorised, declare that they
accept, on behalf of the countries which they represent, the following
provisions:— 1. Each of the Contracting States recognises the validity of an
agreement whether relating to existing or future differences between parties
subject respectively to the jurisdiction of different Contracting States by
which the parties to a contract agree to submit to arbitration all or any
differences that may arise in connection with such contract relating to
commercial matters or to any other matter capable of settlement by
arbitration, whether or not the arbitration is to take place in a country to
whose jurisdiction none of the parties is subject. Each Contracting State
reserves the right to limit the obligation mentioned above to contracts which
are considered as commercial under its national law. Any Contracting State
which avails itself of this right will notify the Secretary-General of the
League of Nations in order that the other Contracting States may be so
informed. 2. The arbitral procedure, including the constitution of the
Arbitral Tribunal, shall be governed by the will of the parties and by the law
of the country in whose territory the arbitration takes place. The Contracting
States agree to facilitate all steps in the procedure which require to be
taken in their own territories, in accordance with the provisions of their law
governing arbitral procedure applicable to existing differences. 3. Each
Contracting State undertakes to ensure the execution by its authorities and in
accordance with the provisions of its national laws of arbitral awards made in
its own territory under the preceding articles. 4. The Tribunals of the
Contracting Parties, on being seized of a dispute regarding a contract made
between persons to whom Article I applies and including an Arbitration
Agreement whether referring to present or future differences which is valid in
virtue of the said article and capable of being carried into effect, shall
refer the parties on the application of either of them to the decision of the
Arbitrators. Such reference shall not prejudice the competence of the judicial
tribunals in case the agreement or the arbitration cannot proceed or becomes
inoperative. 5. The present Protocol, which shall remain open for signature by
all States, shall be ratified. The ratification shall be deposited as soon as
possible with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who shall notify
such deposit to all the Signatory States. 6. The present Protocol will come
into force as soon as two ratifications have been deposited. Thereafter it
will take effect, in the case of each Contracting State, one month after the
notification by the Secretary-General of the deposit of its ratification. 7.
The present Protocol may be denounced by any Contracting State on giving one
year’s notice. Denunciation shall be effected by a notification addressed to
the Secretary-General of the League, who will immediately transmit copies of
such notification to all the other Signatory States and inform them of the
date on which it was received. The denunciation shall take effect one year
after the date on which it was notified to the Secretary-General, and shall
operate only in respect of the notifying State. 8. The Contracting States may
declare that their acceptance of the present Protocol does not include any or
all of the under-mentioned territories: that is to say, their colonies,
overseas possessions or territories, protectorates or the territories over
which they exercise a mandate. The said States may subsequently adhere
separately on behalf of any territory thus excluded. The Secretary-General of
the League of Nations shall be informed as soon as possible of such adhesions.
He shall notify such adhesions to all Signatory States. They will take effect
one month after the notification by the Secretary-General to all Signatory
States. The Contracting States may also denounce the Protocol separately on
behalf of any of the territories referred to above. Article 7 applies to such
denunciation. THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION Act, 1996 THE THIRD SCHEDULE
(See section 53) CONVENTION OF THE EXECUTION OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS
Article 1.—(1) In the territories of any High Contracting Party to which the
present Convention applies, an arbitral award made in pursuance of an
agreement, whether relating to existing or future differences (hereinafter
called “a submission to arbitration”) covered by the Protocol on Arbitration
Clauses opened at Geneva on September 24th, 1923, shall be recognised as
binding and shall be enforced in accordance with the rules of the procedure of
the territory where the award is relied upon, provided that the said award has
been made in a territory of one of the High Contracting Parties to which the
present Convention applies and between persons who are subject to the
jurisdiction of one of the High Contracting Parties. (2) To obtain such
recognition or enforcement, it shall, further, be necessary— (a) that the
award has been made in pursuance of a submission to arbitration which is valid
under the law applicable thereto; (b) that the subject-matter of the award is
capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the country in which the
award is sought to be relied upon; (c) that the award has been made by the
Arbitral Tribunal provided for in the submission to arbitration or constituted
in the manner agreed upon by the parties and in conformity with the law
governing the arbitration procedure; (d) that the award has become final in
the country in which it has been made, in the sense that it will not be
considered as such if it is open to opposition, appeal or pourvoi en cassation
(in the countries where such forms of procedure exist) or if it is proved that
any proceedings for the purpose of contesting the validity of the award are
pending; (e) that the recognition or enforcement of the award is not contrary
to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which
it is sought to be relied upon. Article 2.—Even if the conditions laid down in
Article 1 hereof are fulfilled, recognition and enforcement of the award shall
be refused if the court is satisfied— (a) that the award has been annulled in
the country in which it was made; (b) that the party against whom it is sought
to use the award was not given notice of the arbitration proceedings in
sufficient time to enable him to present his case; or that, being under a
legal incapacity, he was not properly represented; (c) that the award does not
deal with the differences contemplated by or falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration or that it contains decisions on matters beyond the
scope of the submission to arbitration. If the award has not covered all the
questions submitted to the arbitral tribunal, the competent authority of the
country where recognition or enforcement of the award is sought can, if it
thinks fit, postpone such recognition or enforcement or grant it subject to
such guarantee as that authority may decide. Article 3.—If the party against
whom the award has been made proves that, under the law governing the
arbitration procedure, there is a ground, other than the grounds referred to
in Article 1(a) and (c), and Article 2(b) and (c), entitling him to contest
the validity of the award in a Court of Law, the Court may, if it thinks fit,
either refuse recognition or enforcement of the award or adjourn the
consideration thereof, giving such party a reasonable time within which to
have the award annulled by the competent tribunal. Article 4.—The party
relying upon an award or claiming its enforcement must supply, in particular—
(1) the original award or a copy thereof duly authenticated, according to the
requirements of the law of the country in which it was made; (2) documentary
or other evidence to prove that the award has become final, in the sense
defined in Article 1(d), in the country in which it was made; (3) when
necessary, documentary or other evidence to prove that the conditions laid
down in Article 1, paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) (a) and (c), have been
fulfilled. A translation of the award and of the other documents mentioned in
this Article into the official language of the country where the award is
sought to be relied upon may be demanded. Such translations must be certified
correct by a diplomatic or consular agent of the country to which the party
who seeks to rely upon the award belongs or by a sworn translator of the
country where the award is sought to be relied upon. Article 5.—The provisions
of the above Articles shall not deprive any interested party of the right of
availing himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed
by the law or the treaties of the country where such award is sought to be
relied upon. Article 6.—The present Convention applies only to arbitral awards
made after the coming into force of the Protocol on Arbitration Clauses opened
at Geneva on September 24th, 1923. Article 7.—The present Convention, which
will remain open to the signature of all the signatories of the Protocol of
1923 on Arbitration Clauses, shall be ratified. It may be ratified only on
behalf of those Members of the League of Nations and Non-Member States on
whose behalf the Protocol of 1923 shall have been ratified. Ratification shall
be deposited as soon as possible with the Secretary-General of the League of
Nations, who will notify such deposit to all the signatories. Article 8.—The
present Convention shall come into force three months after it shall have been
ratified on behalf of two High Contracting Parties. Thereafter, it shall take
effect, in the case of each High Contracting Party, three months after the
deposit of the ratification on its behalf with the Secretary-General of the
League of Nations. Article 9.—The present Convention may be denounced on
behalf of any Member of the League or Non-Member State. Denunciation shall be
notified in writing to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who
will immediately send a copy thereof, certified to be in conformity with the
notifications, to all the other Contracting Parties, at the same time
informing them of the date on which he received it. The denunciation shall
come into force only in respect of the High Contracting Party which shall have
notified it and one year after such notification shall have reached the
Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The denunciation of the Protocol
on Arbitration Clauses shall entail, ipso facto, the denunciation of the
present Convention. Article 10.—The present Convention does not apply to the
colonies, protectorates or territories under suzerainty or mandate of any High
Contracting Party unless they are specially mentioned. The application of this
Convention to one or more of such colonies, protectorates or territories to
