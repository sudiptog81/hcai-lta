6\. The trade mark "CUTLER-HAMMER" was first adopted by Cutler- Hammer Inc.,
predecessor-in-interest and title of plaintiff No.1 in the year 1893 in
respect of electric apparatus for use in operating machines and goods
mentioned above.
7\. The plaintiffs‟ contention is that the predecessor-in-title of Cutler-
Hammer Inc. first shipped the goods included in Class 9 under trademark
"CUTLER-HAMMER" to India in the year 1919. Since that time, the plaintiff‟s
predecessor-in-interest and title and then plaintiffs have continued to use
the said trademark in respect of goods of its manufacture and sale so much so
that the plaintiffs‟ trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER" have come about to be
exclusively identified and recognized by the CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
No.575/2012 Page 3 of 72 purchasing public and the members of the trade with
the goods of the plaintiffs and none else.
The trade mark "CH" was first adopted by Cutler-Hammer Inc., predecessor-in-
interest and title of plaintiff No.1 in the year 1954 in India in respect of
goods falling in Class 9 and has been used in India initially by the
plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title and then by plaintiffs from

8\. Plaintiffs‟ trademarks "CUTLER-HAMMER", "CH Control" and "CH (label)" are
being used in several countries in the world. The list of countries in which
products bearing the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER", "CH Control and "CH (label)"
has been filed.
9\. Plaintiffs‟ trademarks "CUTLER-HAMMER", "CH Control" and "CH (label)" are
also the subject matter of numerous registrations in number of countries of
the world covering variety of goods falling in international Class 9. Copies
of a sample of some of the registration certificates have been filed on
record.
10\. The registration of the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER" under No.164435 was
applied by Cutler-Hammer Inc. on 8th June, 1954 as per the provisions of the
Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in India. Plaintiff No.1 acquired the
company Cutler-Hammer Inc. in the year 1978 whereby request on Form-24 dated
28th November, 1979 was filed. Pursuant to request on Form-24 and order dated
23rd January, 1980, plaintiff No.1 was registered as subsequent proprietor by
virtue of Certificate of Merger.
11\. The plaintiff No.1 also registered the trade mark(s) "CH (label)", "CH
Control" and "CH" in respect of electric goods included in Class 9 under the
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 4 of 72 provisions of Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in India. The details of these trademarks are as
follows:
> Sr. Trademark Registration No. Class Date of No. application
> 1\. 205632 9 03.11.1975
> 2\. 164434 9 08.06.1954
> 3\. 642706 9 11.10.1994
12\. The registration of the abovementioned trademark "CUTTER- HAMMER" under
No.164435 confers an exclusive right on the plaintiffs to the use of the said
trademarks under Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999\. The use of any mark
which may be identical and/or deceptively similar thereto in respect of the
same or similar description of goods or service constitute an act of
infringement under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as well as passing
off.
13\. The contention of the plaintiffs is that trademarks "CUTLER- HAMMER", "CH
Control" and "CH (label)" enjoys wide reputation, recognition and popularity
in the Indian and world market for high quality of products sold under it.
These trademarks have created its own identity in the market and have
immensely contributed in generation of goodwill so much so that it has
acquired the trans-border reputation which has spilled over to India.
14\. The defendant, BCH Electric Limited having its office at 1101, New Delhi
House, 27-Barakhamba Road, New Delhi-110 001 also at, Block 1E216, AJC Bose
Road, Kolkata-700017 and 20/4, Mathura Road CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
No.575/2012 Page 5 of 72 Faridabad-121 006, Haryana is also engaged in the
business of manufacture and sale of electric goods falling in Class 9.
15\. The defendant (the expression whereof shall include its predecessor- in-
interest and title) was set up in the year 1965 as a result of the joint
venture between the plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-
Hammer Inc. and some Indian partners in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER INDIA
LIMITED. The name of defendant Company was later changed to Bhartia Cutler-
Hammer Ltd. In the year 1995, it was renamed as Bhartia Industries Limited.
With effect from 25th October, 2007, the name was again changed to BCH
Electric Limited, the present defendant herein.
16\. From the year of its incorporation, defendant entered into various
agreements with plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-Hammer
Inc. to flourish Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s business in India. These agreement
included „Sales Agreement‟ and „License and Technical Service Agreement‟ dated
3rd June, 1974 whereby defendant has accepted the ownership of the Cutler-
Hammer Inc. over the trademarks/trade names and further agreed to not to do
anything which will impair Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s ownership over these
trademarks/trade names.
17\. In the year 1979, Cutler-Hammer Inc. entered into trading name agreement
with Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited (now defendant) whereby defendant was
granted the right to use the words CUTLER-HAMMER as part of the corporate
title by Cutler-Hammer Inc. The said agreement allowed defendant to use the
words "Cutler-Hammer" as part of their corporate title in a limited way/manner
and in connection with goods manufactured under the license from Cutler-Hammer
Inc. The agreement specifically mentions that Cutler-Hammer Inc. is the owner
of the words CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 6 of 72 "CUTLER-
HAMMER" when used as a registered or unregistered trademark, corporate title
or trading style in the field of activity in which parties are engaged.
18\. On 19th February, 1979, a registered user agreement was executed between
Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited (now defendant) and Cutler- Hammer Inc. whereby
defendant was granted non-exclusive right to use the following registered
trademarks:
>  Trademark "C-H Monogram Border" under No.164434.  Trademark "CUTLER-
> HAMMER" under No.164435.  Trademark "CH Control" under No.205632.
19\. Defendant was allowed to use the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER" under
No.164435 in conjunction with the word Bhartia. Whereas the other two
trademarks were allowed to be used along with the legend "Made in India by
Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited, a wholly Indian owned Licensee of Cutler-
Hammer, Inc. U.S.A.
20\. In the User Agreement, defendant acknowledged and admitted the Cutler-
Hammer Inc.‟s title and proprietorship in the trademarks "CUTLER- HAMMER, CH &
CH Control". The agreement clearly mentions in clause 7 that:
> "User recognizes the Trade Mark Owner‟s title to the said trade Marks and
> shall not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing which will in
> any way impair the rights of the Trade Mark Owner in or to said Trade Marks.
> It is understood that User shall not acquire and shall not claim any title
> to the said trademarks by virtue of the license granted to user or through
> user‟s use of the said trademarks, it being the intention of the parties
> that all use of said Trade Marks by user shall at all times inure to the
> benefit of the Trade Mark Owner."
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 7 of 72
The duration of the abovementioned agreement was for seven years which had
expired in the year 1986.
21\. The plaintiffs have set up their case against the defendant by making
various allegations that the defendant is deliberately, fraudulently and with
malafide intentions of trading upon the reputation and goodwill attached to
plaintiff‟s trademark CUTLER-HAMMER, CH Control & CH (label), is using it
without obtaining any consent, permission or valid license.
The dishonest and malafide intentions of defendant are apparent from the fact
that despite being aware of the reputation of plaintiff‟s trademark "CH
(label)" worldwide including India and proprietorship of plaintiff No.1 over
the trademark "CH Control" under No.205632 in Class 9 since 3rd November, 1975
in accordance with the provisions of Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 and
having admitted rights of plaintiff no.1 in the Registered User Agreement,
defendant applied for registration of the identical/deceptively similar
trademark under No.582999 in Class 9 in the year 1992 and obtained
registration thereof by playing fraud on the registry and making false claim
of proprietorship and user thereof.
22\. It is alleged in the plaint that the defendant taking advantage of this
situation filed an application under No.582999 for registration of the
trademark "CH Control" through the same service provider. The defendant has
obtained the registration of the said mark wrongfully and in bad faith by
committing fraud over the Registry.
23\. It is also alleged against the defendant that by committing fraud,
defendant applied for registration of the identical/deceptively similar
trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER (Device)" under No.1189782 in Class 9 in the year
2003. The plaintiff No.1 filed notice of opposition opposing CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 8 of 72 registration of the impugned
mark subject matter of Application No.1189782 on/or around 23rd June 2004 with
the Registrar of Trade Marks at New Delhi. The said opposition proceedings
initiated by the plaintiffs are pending.
24\. In the year 2007, defendant made another attempt to register identical
and/or deceptively similar trademark "BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER (Label)" under
application No.1562940 in Class 9 and the same is pending as objected by the
plaintiffs.
25\. It is submitted that defendant was aware of the reputation and
proprietorship of plaintiff No.1 over trademarks "CUTLER-HAMMER", "CH Control"
and "CH" in respect of the goods of its manufacture and sale prior to its
incorporation and has adopted and used the identical and/or deceptively
similar trademarks with dishonest and malafide intentions to trade upon the
reputation and goodwill of plaintiffs and to earn profits in an illegal
manner. By committing such acts, defendant has not only infringed plaintiff‟s
proprietary rights vested in their registered trademark "CUTLER- HAMMER" and
other abovementioned trademarks but also committed acts of passing off their
inferior quality goods and business as and for the quality products and
business of plaintiff. The defendant has no plausible reason to choose
identical/deceptively similar marks CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH
(logo) and/or CH Control as a trade mark for their products.
26\. The defendant‟s products are bound to be falsely associated being part of
range of products of the plaintiff. The use of identical and/or deceptively
similar trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH (logo) and/or CH
Control on the part of the defendant is unlawful and CS(OS) No.156/2012 &
CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 9 of 72 constitutes violation of the plaintiff‟s
rights as are protected under the provision of Section 29 of the Trade Marks
Act, 1999 and under the common law.
27\. On 19th December, 2011, plaintiffs published a caution notice announcing
their statutory rights over the trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER" in Class 9 since the
year 1954. In response to the caution notice, the defendant through their
counsel sent a reply to the caution notice via email and registered post on
22nd December, 2011. By way of the said reply, defendant claimed proprietary
rights in the trademark BHARTIA CUTLER- HAMMER and CH Control. By way of the
said reply; plaintiff came to know that defendant has also applied for
registration of trademark "BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER" under No.1562940 in Class 9.
It was revealed by the plaintiffs from the website of Registrar of Trademarks
about the filing of application for registrations of the same very trademarks
which were earlier used by the defendant under permissive use of the
trademarks belonging to the plaintiffs.
28\. The plaintiffs, thereafter, have filed the suit for permanent injunction
restraining infringement of trademarks, passing of, unfair competition and
renditions of accounts and damages against the defendant. Along with suit, the
plaintiffs also filed an application being I.A. No.1204/2012 under Order
XXXIX, Rules 1 & 2 CPC for grant of interim injunction against the defendant
from using the trade marks CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in any manner by the defendant
by passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs. The abovementioned suit
was filed in the month of January, 2012. The defendant filed its written
statement and reply in the month of February, 2012\.
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 10 of 72
29\. The defendant also filed suit against the plaintiffs being CS(OS)
No.575/2012 in the month of March, 2012 along with interim application being
I.A. No.4318/2012 seeking injunction against the plaintiffs for issuance of
groundless threats to the dealers of the defendants.
30\. Both sides have made their submissions in their respective interim
applications. As the facts in both matters are common, therefore, by this
common order, the pending two interim applications are being decided by the
single order.
31\. Various defences have been raised by the defendant in its written
statement and reply to the interim application filed by the plaintiffs.
Mr.Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of defendant has
made his submission that no case of infringement of trademarks has been made
out by the plaintiffs against his client as plaintiff No.1 has not acquired
any rights in the mark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 which was in the name of
Cutler-Hammer, Inc. The said registration is not valid. The defendant‟s
application for rectification/removal/cancellation of the mark is pending with
the Trade Marks Registry. The trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER is not being used by
plaintiffs in India; abandoned by plaintiffs and, therefore, no
goodwill/reputation vests in the said marks in favour of plaintiffs. The trade
mark CUTLER-HAMMER is associated in India with defendant and its
products/business.
The trade mark (CH being the abbreviation of CUTLER- HAMMER) is registered
under No.582999 in Class 9 in the name of defendant since the year 1992.
Therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to establish even prima facie case of
infringement of trademarks.
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 11 of 72
32\. The second submission of Mr.Sethi is that the plaintiffs have also failed
to make out any case of passing off as the plaintiffs are not using the marks
CUTLER-HAMMER, , , , and/or variants thereof in relation to their
business/products in India. No products of plaintiffs bearing any of the
aforesaid trademarks are available for sale in India. The aforesaid marks have
been abandoned by plaintiffs. In fact, no products bearing the said marks have
been produced/filed in the Court. There is no goodwill/reputation vested in
favour of plaintiffs in the said marks.
          The    marks        ,   BHARTIA         CUTLER-HAMMER,         CUTLER-
    HAMMER,                       are exclusively associated with defendant. The
said products and are distinctive of its products/business by virtue of
continuous and extensive use for several decades. There is no evidence of
confusion and deception placed by the plaintiffs on record. There is no
likelihood of confusion/deception as plaintiffs‟ products bearing the said
marks are not available in India. Therefore, no damage would be caused to
plaintiffs on account of use of the said marks by defendant. On the contrary,
defendant will suffer irreparable loss, damage and injury, if plaintiffs
commence use of the said marks in India. Rather the plaintiffs have abandoned
their trademarks in India who themselves have allowed removal of their
following trade marks in India and other countries as admitted by the
plaintiffs in their rejoinder due to non-payment of their renewal fee and have
not taken any steps for restoration. The details are as under:

(Hereinafter the abovementioned logos or variant thereof would be referred as
"CH" logo, and logo of CUTLER-HAMMER as "CUTLER-HAMMER")
33\. Despite having incorporated a subsidiary in India i.e. plaintiff No.2 as
far back as in the year 1996, plaintiff No.1 has not used the said marks in
respect of its products/business and neither raised any objection against
defendant‟s activities in India. Plaintiffs‟ products available in India do
not depict/bear the trade marks „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ or „CH‟ or variants thereof.
Products purchased by defendant on 22nd, December, 2011 which does not show
use of the said marks. The invoice raised in respect of the said products also
does- not show use of the marks. Plaintiffs have filed few purchase orders of
2009, 2010 and 2011 however, the same do not show any actual sale of the
products in India under the mark CUTLER-HAMMER. Further, plaintiffs have
relied on a catalogue of 2001 pertaining to Canada to correlate the product
codes. No document has been placed on record by the CS(OS) No.156/2012 &
CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 13 of 72 plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in
question post 1986, thereby confirming that plaintiff No.1 lost
interest/rights in the marks CUTLER- HAMMER, CH post 1986 and have commenced
use only recently so as to ride on the goodwill and reputation vesting in the
defendant‟s marks.
34\. The sales figures provided by plaintiffs for the years 2008-2011 in
respect of their products are vague, misleading, unsubstantiated and scanty
inasmuch as the same are neither indicative of sales in India nor discloses
use of these trademarks. The sales figures of Rs.35 lac, which at any rate are
vague, unsubstainated and denied, provided by plaintiffs towards sale of
products in the year 2008 bearing the marks in question are no match to the
sales generated by defendant in the year 2008 i.e. `1,94,82,68,813/-.
35\. No document including promotional materials/advertisements has been
placed on record by the plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in question
post 1986. The Caution Notice published by the plaintiffs on 19th December,
2011 in the daily, „The Times of India‟ was confined to the trade mark CUTLER-
HAMMER and there was no whisper of the marks CH and/or variants thereof.
36\. Nothing on record to show that the Registered User Agreement dated 19th
February, 1979 was recorded with the Trade Marks Registry as per Section 48 of
the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, thus, it does not lie in the mouth
of the plaintiffs to say that „use‟ would accrue to the plaintiffs for the
period 1979-1986.
37\. It is also argued by Mr.Sethi that the present action of the plaintiffs
suffers from long delay, laches, acquiesces and waiver on the part of
plaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled for the discretionary
relief of injunction.
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 14 of 72
It is admitted by the defendants that after the expiry of the Registered User
Agreement in 1986, defendant continued to use, inter alia, the trademarks
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH with the full knowledge, consent and
encouragement of Plaintiff No.1 by way of addressing letters by the plaintiffs
themselves and various meetings and discussions between the parties at least
for the last 25 years.
38\. Certain following illustrative instances have been given by the defendant
in order to show the knowledge of the plaintiffs about the continuous user of
trademarks in question:
i) Plaintiffs have admitted to the fact that the letters exchanged between
Plaintiff No.1 and Defendant reflected Defendant‟s use of the trade marks
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letter head.
ii) Plaintiff No.1 had entered into Sales Agreements on 13th July, 1988 and
4th September, 1990 with defendant‟s affiliate viz. Bhartia International
Private Limited (which later merged into defendant); License and Technical
Service Agreements dated 10th April, 1990 and 11th December, 1992 with
defendant and Export Agreement dated March 16, 1994 between plaintiff No.1 and
defendant.
iii) Plaintiff No.1 and Defendant exchanged various correspondences and
visited each other‟s offices/factories in India and the USA in connection with
business as well as to explore new business opportunities. The letters
addressed by defendant clearly reflected use of the trade marks BHARTIA
CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letterhead. The product brochure
forwarded to plaintiff No.1 also bore the trademarks/ names BHARTIA CUTLER-
HAMMER and CH of the defendant. The CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012
Page 15 of 72 representatives of plaintiffs who visited the office/factory of
defendant could not have missed defendant‟s use of the said marks.
39\. Plaintiffs' Indirect Knowledge
i) When the plaintiff No.1 had filed fresh application seeking registration of
the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ under No.642706 on 11th October, 1994, the
Examination Report issued by the Trade Marks Registry on 22nd October, 1999
cited defendant‟s prior mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ under No.582999 against
plaintiffs‟ application. There was opposition from the plaintiffs‟ side.
ii) Mr.Jamshed Khurram, Director - Sales & Marketing PD, South Asia of
plaintiff No.2 and Mr.Ajay Jain, President of plaintiff No.1‟s affiliate
company Moeller HPL India Private Limited were employees of the defendant
during 2004-2005 and 2001-2005 as Business Manager (OEM) and General Manager
(Sales and Marketing) respectively.
iii) Plaintiff No.2 was incorporated on 1st March, 1996 and has an office at
Delhi. Defendant also has an office at Delhi. The Directors and other senior
employees of Plaintiff No.2 have been in constant touch with Defendant and
have visited its offices.
iv) Being in the same line of business, Plaintiff No.2 is deemed to have been
aware of Defendant‟s business/products bearing the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-
HAMMER, CUTLER- HAMMER and CH. Defendant has been continuously and extensively
using the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER- HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in respect of
its products/business for nearly half a century and products bearing the said
marks are available in every nook and corner of the country. Therefore, the
plaintiffs/their CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 16 of 72
predecessor had waived their rights, if at all, in the trade marks CUTLER-
HAMMER, CH and variants thereof.
It is not open now for the plaintiffs to exit from India and then return after
lapse of a few decades and seek to restrain the defendant, an Indian company,
which has, in the meantime, established a goodwill/reputation in its favour.
Upon realizing the magnitude of defendant‟s business and its reputation in the
market vis-à-vis plaintiffs‟ failure to gain market share in India, they are
now attempting to usurp defendant‟s business/trade marks in India.
40\. Mr.Sethi argued that law assists those who are vigilant about their
rights and not those who sleep over their rights - Vigilantibus Non
Dormientibus Acquitas Subveniunt'. Plaintiffs are, therefore, estopped, both
in law and equity from asserting rights over the statutory and proprietary
rights of Defendant in the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH.
41\. It is also challenged by the defendant that the plaintiff No.1 has
acquired the company Cutler-Hammer, Inc. in the year 1978, as it is the
admitted position that the plaintiffs have made the application on 28th
November, 1979 on Form TM-24 for recordal of change in ownership in the Trade
Marks Registry, Kolkata. Pursuant to the said request and order thereon dated
January 23, 1980, Plaintiff No.1 was registered as subsequent proprietor of
the mark CUTLER-HAMMER by virtue of Certificate of merger. Plaintiffs have not
filed any documents to show that the said registration and/or any other marks
were part of the merger.
On 31st May, 2010, plaintiff No.1 also filed a request on Form TM- 33 (for
recordal of change of name) with the Registry indicating that Cutler-
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 17 of 72
Hammer, Inc. is the subsequent proprietor of the said mark and that „Cutler-
Hammer, Inc.‟ has, by virtue of Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of
Incorporation dated 20th August, 2003, changed its name to „Eaton Electrical,
Inc.‟ After raising objection by the defendant on 28th April, 2012, plaintiffs
vide letter dated 2nd May, 2012 filed a request with the Trade Marks Registry,
Mumbai withdrawing the said request. In the said letter, plaintiffs for the
first time disclosed that there are two, Cutler-Hammer Inc. In view of above,
the plaintiffs herein have no locus to seek an injunction against the
defendant.
42\. It is also alleged by the defendant that the balance of convenience
exists in favour of defendant, as the defendant is a leading manufacturer and
distributor of premium low voltage electrical and electronics products in
India. The defendant presently employs approximately 1800 personnel and 150
engineers including a strong R&D department. It has over 30 sales offices with
numerous „Resident Engineer‟ locations strategically spread all over India and
over 500 dealers and thousands of sub-dealer network to better serve its
customers. The defendant‟s products are exported to over 25 countries, either
directly, or through authorized distributors in jurisdictions such as Europe,
Far East, Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia. In fact, on account of
extensive and continuous use of the trade marks by the defendant in respect of
its products/business for over 25 years, a prima facie case exists in favour
of the defendant and against the plaintiffs.

43\. The defendant in its case is seeking, inter alia, an injunction against
plaintiffs from extending threats to its affiliates, customers, distributors,
dealers, agents etc., as plaintiffs are wrongly claiming rights in the marks
„CUTLER-HAMMER‟ and CH and issuing threats to defendant‟s dealers,
distributors and agents thereby hampering its business and creating confusion
in the minds of the discerning members and also by issuing publication of the
Caution Notice for the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟. On 6th January, 2012, plaintiff
No.1, through its lawyers, addressed a „cease and desist‟ letter to defendant
calling upon it to refrain from using the marks CUTLER-HAMMER and „CH‟ (label)
and/or any deceptive variation/s thereof and termed its products as
„counterfeit‟.
44\. The defendant is the proprietor of the trade mark „CUTLER- HAMMER‟
registered in Class 9, registration of which dates back to 14th October, 1992.
Plaintiffs‟ use of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is identical/deceptively
similar to defendant‟s registered trade mark „CUTLER- HAMMER‟ in relation to
identical goods/products is tantamount to infringement of defendant‟s
statutory rights vesting in its registered and reputed trade mark „CUTLER-
HAMMER‟. Goodwill and reputation subsisting in defendant‟s trademarks/logos,
CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH any use of the said marks and/or
deceptive variations thereof would mislead and deceive the public/ consumers
into believing that plaintiffs‟ business/products originate from CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 20 of 72 defendant. Thus, plaintiffs are
guilty of passing off as plaintiffs are intentionally and blatantly violating
defendant‟s rights in the aforesaid trademarks and a case of misappropriation
leading to deception amongst the members of trade and public is clearly made
out against plaintiffs.
The balance of convenience exists in favour of defendant, as due to long,
continuous and extensive use of the marks/logos, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,
CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in India for the last several decades, the same are well-
known and deserve protection. On the other hand, the plaintiffs have recently
commenced use of „CUTLER- HAMMER‟ who had earlier abandoned the marks „CUTLER-
HAMMER‟ and CH and variants thereof in India as well as internationally, thus
they have no authority/justification to assert rights over the same. Use of
the aforesaid mark by plaintiffs is with the sole intention of riding upon
defendant‟s fame and goodwill garnered over the years.
45\. An irreparable harm and injury is being suffered by defendant by virtue
of (i) publication of Caution Notice by plaintiff No.1 claiming exclusivity
over the mark CUTLER-HAMMER; (ii) issuance of threats to Plaintiff/its
dealers/distributors; and (iii) plaintiffs‟ recent commencement of use of the
mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is identical/deceptively similar to defendant‟s
registered and well-known trademarks, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and
CH. Plaintiffs being in the same trade and business as defendant, it will
cause irreversible damage to the goodwill, fair name, reputation and integrity
of defendant, its businesses and the much renowned and well-known
trademarks/logos BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH.
46\. In case, pleadings of both the parties are read, it is not disputed by
the defendant that trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER and the device CH are well CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 21 of 72 known trademarks, there would
be confusion and deception if both the parties are allowed to use the same
trademarks. The defendant has also not disputed the facts that two sets of
trademarks are same and are being used by both parties in relation to same
product. The defendant has also not denied that the defendant entered into an
agreement „Registered User Agreement‟ bearing the said trademarks and the
defendant has filed the applications for registrations of the same very
trademarks which were earlier being used as a permissive-use under the licence
agreements. The plaintiffs‟ oppositions to the various applications for
registration filed by the defendant are pending. The main case of the
defendant is that after breaking relation between the parties, the defendant
has been using the same very trademarks for the last 25 years within the
knowledge of the plaintiffs. The defendant has acquired unique and independent
goodwill and reputation of trademarks in India and abroad. The plaintiffs on
the other hand abandoned their trademarks as some of trademarks are not
renewed. The plaintiffs have not been using the trademarks in India and other
parts of the world. The defendant is the registered proprietor of trade mark
logo of CH in Class 9 as on 14 th October, 1992\. The plaintiffs are
unnecessary harassing the defendant by extending their threats by various
ways. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not only entitled for injunction prayed
for rather they should be restrained from extending their threat as prayed in
the application for injunction filed by the defendant.
47\. In order to decide these two applications, the following issues are to be
considered by the Court:
> i) Whether the defendant is infringing the registered mark CUTLER-HAMMER.
> ii) Whether the defendant is passing off its goods as that of the
> plaintiffs‟.
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 22 of 72
> iii) Whether the defendant being earlier permissive user of trademarks are
> entitled to claim the proprietorship rights after the expiry of period of
> licence agreement and are entitled to use the same trademarks.
> iv) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for interim injunction at this stage
> despite of delay, latches, acquiesces and waiver as per plea raised by the
> defendant.
> v) Whether the defendant who is also holding the registration of logo mark
> CH in Class 9 as of 14 th October, 1992 can be retrained by this Court.
> vi) Whether the defendant is entitled for injunction against the plaintiffs
> in its application being I.A. No.4318/2012 restraining the plaintiffs for
> extending the groundless threats to the dealers and other representatives of
> the defendant.
> vii) In whose favour balance of conveniences lies in view of the facts and
> circumstances of the present two actions filed by the parties.

    vi)      Other 21 trademarks applied by Defendant on 29th May, 2007 are
pending for registration; List of marks is filed on record.
51\. The plaintiffs‟ case now rest on:
> i. Action of infringement filed on the basis of Plaintiffs‟ statutory rights
> vested in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER bearing No.164435 in Class 09;
> ii. Action of passing off filed on the basis of Common law rights which
> plaintiffs have acquired in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER and variants thereof
> bearing No.642706 in Class 09.
52\. From the pending applications filed by the defendant as well as
registrations, it appears that the defendant has claimed its own user of the
trademarks also for the period when the defendant was using the trademarks as
permissive user as a licensee of the plaintiffs.
53\. Although the defendant‟s case in the written statement is also that after
expiry of user agreement, the defendant continued to use the marks with the
knowledge of the plaintiffs at least for the last 25 years.
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 30 of 72
54\. These two versions of the defendant are clearly contrary to each other.
55\. From the material placed on record, it reveals that the plaintiffs are
prior adopter and user of trademarks than the alleged user claimed by the
defendant in the world market including India as the plaintiff No.1 (including
its predecessor) is the prior adopter and user of the trademark(s) CUTLER-
HAMMER and CH worldwide including India. The details are given as below:-
> (i) The trade mark "CUTLER-HAMMER" was first adopted by Cutler-Hammer, Inc.
> in the year 1893. Cutler-Hammer, Inc. (Predecessor of plaintiff no.1) first
> shipped its goods under trademark "CUTLER-HAMMER" to India in the year 1919.
> (ii) The trade mark CH was first adopted by predecessor-in-interest and
> title of plaintiff No.1 in the year 1914 in USA and thereafter in India in
> respect of goods falling in Class 9. The trade mark CH was first adopted by
> Cutler-Hammer, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest and title of plaintiff no.1) in
> the year 1960 in USA and thereafter in India in respect of goods falling in
> Class 9. The mark CH was superseded by new version of CH (Logo) that is
> CUTLER- HAMMER in the year 1994.
56\. Plaintiffs‟ trademarks were registered prior in point of time to the user
claim by the defendant in its trade marks application as the plaintiff‟s
trademark CUTLER-HAMMER bearing No.164435 in Class 09 is registered since 8th
June, 1954 when the defendant company was not even in existence.
57\. The plaintiffs‟ trademark CH bearing application No.164434 in Class 09
was registered since 8th June, 1954. Further, the plaintiff‟s CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 31 of 72 trademark CH bearing
application No.205632 in Class 09 was registered since 3rd November, 1961.
However, the said registrations were removed for non-payment of renewal fee
due for period 1989 - 1996.
58\. Legal Proceeding Certificates, i.e. certified copies of registrations
reveal that the plaintiff No.1 is the subsequent registered proprietor of the
trademark cutler-hammer bearing No.164435 in Class 09. The said trademark was
initially registered in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER, INC. In the year 1979,
CUTLER-HAMMER, INC. merged with and into Plaintiff no.1. Therefore, pursuant
to request on form TM-24 dated 28th November, 1979 by erstwhile agents Remfry
& Son (now Remfry & Sagar) and order thereon dated 23rd January, 1980, Eaton
Corporation (Plaintiff No.1) became the subsequent registered proprietor as
from 30th March, 1979 by virtue of Certificate of Merger.
59\. Defendant‟s objections that the plaintiff No.1 has not acquired any
rights in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 is without any substance
on account of following reasons:
> i. Defendant has not only admitted the fact that trademark CUTLER- HAMMER
> belongs to plaintiff no.1 that is Eaton Corporation but has also published
> the fact that their products are manufactured in technical collaboration
> with CUTLER-HAMMER(which is a division of Eaton Corporation) in its catalogs
> that were distributed to customers in India. The same is available on record
> at page 448 filed along with defendant‟s list of documents on 17th February,
> 2012.
It is informed by Mr.Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior counsel that the said
request for recordal of plaintiff No.1 as subsequent registered proprietor of
the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER in application No.164435 was filed CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 32 of 72 by Remfry & Sagar who are now
counsel for defendant. It is not open for counsel for defendant to now
challenge the said order of the Registrar which was passed on the basis of
request made through them and on their declaration made in form TM-24 dated
28th November, 1979, as law does not permit a person to both approbate and
reprobate. This principle is based on the doctrine of election which
postulates that no party can accept and reject the same instrument and that "a
person cannot say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain
some advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is
valid, and then turn round and say it is void for the purpose of securing some
other advantage". Case Law: R.N. GOSAIN vs. Yashpal Dhir, AIR 1993 SC 352.

show that the plaintiffs‟ trademarks are well-known marks and has transborder

62\. It is not denied by the defendant about the execution of Registered User
Agreement dated 19th February, 1979 and its pleadings. The record also reveals
that an application in the prescribed manner was filed in the Trademark
Registry. However, there is no evidence on record to show whether the said
application for registration of Registered User Agreement was accepted or not.
It is argued by Mr.Sudhir Chandra that since the plaintiff No.1 company had a
base in USA, therefore, defendant (which is an Indian Company) was to complete
all the legal formalities of registration of Registered User Agreement at the
Trade Marks Office through the trademark agent Remfry & Sons (now Remfry &
Sagar). Entire documentation (Form TM-28, TM-48 and Affidavit to that effect)
required to register the Registered User Agreement dated 19th February, 1979
was duly completed by plaintiff no.1 as well as defendant.
Both, Cutler-Hammer, Inc. and defendant authorized Remfry & Sons (now Remfry &
Sagar) to act as an agent for entering Bhartia Cutler- Hammer Limited as a
Registered User. Further, the filing and registration of the Registered User
Agreement was left to defendant. As M/s. Ramfry and Sagar is now appearing as
attorney on behalf of the defendant they may be in better position to inform
the Court about its outcome. However, at present, it is immaterial if the
application for user agreement is not accepted or not as the defendant has
admitted the factum of user agreement between CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
No.575/2012 Page 38 of 72 the parties. He relied upon License and Technical
Service Agreement of 1977 which provides that;
> "Section 7.3 The parties acknowledges that as at the inception of this
> Agreement, Licensee (under its prior name, Cutler-Hammer India Limited) is
> an authorized and recorded "Registered User" of the following proprietary
> trademarks of Cutler-Hammer, Inc....."
It is also contended by the plaintiffs that advertisement material, Brochures,
Catalogs and Price lists were supplied by plaintiff No.1 to defendant and its
attorney for the period 1986-1995.

64\. It is not denied by the plaintiffs that the defendant was set up in the
year 1965 as a result of the joint venture between the plaintiff‟s
predecessor- in-interest and title, Cutler-Hammer, Inc. and some Indian
partners in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER INDIA LIMITED. Name of defendant Company
was later changed to Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Ltd. in the year 1977\. Further, it
was changed to Bhartia Industries Limited in the year 1995\. With effect from
25th October, 2007, the name was again changed to CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
No.575/2012 Page 40 of 72 BCH Electric Limited.

how and technical data.
65\. It is not a case of the defendant that they were not aware of
proprietorship of plaintiffs over the trademarks in question. Despite
acknowledging and admitting the proprietary rights of plaintiffs in the
trademark CH and further expressly agreeing not to apply for registration of
the said marks in various agreements executed between the parties, the
defendant dishonestly adopted the impugned mark CUTLER HAMMER and applied for
registration thereof in the year 1992 under No.582999. The same is registered
by committing fraud on the Registry and making false claim of proprietorship
and user thereof. The rectification for removal of impugned trademark from the
Register is filed by plaintiff No.1 on 20th July, 2012 and the same is
admitted by Intellectual Property Appellate Board and numbered as
ORA/269/2012/TM.DEL. Defendant had no plausible explanation/ justification to
adopt the marks, CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH and/or variants
thereof. Even after obtaining registration of the mark "CH (logo)" with the
word CONTROL, the defendant was using the mark CH without using the word
CONTROL below the logo as appeared from registration obtained by the defendant
who has also applied for registration of trademark in various Classes which is
similar to plaintiffs‟ trademark CH.
66\. Despite acknowledging and admitting the proprietary rights of plaintiffs
over the trademark CUTLER HAMMER and further expressly agreeing not to apply
for registration of the said mark in various agreements executed between the
parties, the defendant dishonestly adopted the impugned mark CUTLER HAMMER and
applied for registration thereof in CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012
Page 48 of 72 the year 2003. The plaintiff no.1 filed notice of opposition
opposing registration of the impugned mark subject matter of Application
No.1189782 on/or around 23rd June, 2004 with the Registrar of Trade Marks at
New Delhi. The said opposition proceedings are pending.
In the year 2007, defendant made another severe attempt to register identical
and/or deceptively similar trademark(s) BHARTIA CUTLER- HAMMER, CUTLER HAMMER
and CH and silently filed 21 applications in various Classes with an intention
to obtain proprietary rights over the said impugned marks which are identical/
deceptively similar to plaintiff‟s trademarks in disguise. The said
applications are pending for registration. Surprisingly, out of 21
applications filed in the year 2007, only one application for registration of
trademark CUTLER HAMMER is in relation to goods of defendant‟s manufacture and
sale that is Class 09. Rest of the applications is filed in respect of goods/
services not related to defendant‟s business.
67\. As per Clause III of Sales Agreement 1977-1988 the defendant agreed not
to claim its rights of ownership in trademarks and trademarks which are
property of the plaintiffs and the defendant will not impair plaintiffs‟
ownership of such trademarks and will not use to indicate in anyway that the
defendant is part of the plaintiffs. Similarly, in the License And Technical
Service Agreement as per 7.7 of the Agreement, it was agreed that the licensee
shall not apply or obtain registration of any trademarks and shall not
challenge the validity or contest the right of the proprietor and in the user
agreement between 1979-1986 in Clause 7 the defendant recognized the right the
trademarks of the owner and the defendant shall not acquire and shall not
claim any title to the said trademarks by virtue of the licence CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 49 of 72 granted to the defendant and
user shall at all times have the benefit of the trademark owner.
68\. However, the defendant despite of abovementioned stipulations which are
of the binding clauses has acted absolutely opposite to the agreements
intentionally and deliberately as appeared from its acts and deeds. The
details of wrongful act of the defendant are given as under:-
> (i) The defendant has claimed the proprietorship right in the Trademarks
> Registry and placed evidence in order to obtain the registration during the
> period when the defendant was licensee.
> (ii) The defendant has made every effort to impair the trademarks of the
> plaintiffs.
> (iii) The defendant is claiming by giving its indication that the defendant
> is still part of the plaintiffs which is untrue.
> (iv) The defendant applied for registration and obtained registration of
> logo „CH‟ knowingly, intentionally and fraudulently which is contrary to
> clause 7.7 of the Licence and Technical Service Agreement.
> (v) The defendant has challenged the registration of the plaintiffs contrary
> to the agreements despite of recognizing the ownership rights of the
> plaintiffs. They have claimed their independent rights by acquiring user
> which is in use to the plaintiff.
> (vi) The defendant is claiming independent user in order to become
> proprietor of the same very trademarks.
69\. A mere justification is not enough that as the plaintiffs have not used
the trademarks in India, the defendant is entitled to use the same trademarks
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 50 of 72 who can also claim
proprietary rights independently as there is delay on the part of the
plaintiffs.
70\. It is necessary here to discuss the similar aspect which has been dealt
with by the Division Bench of this Court and the Supreme Court who have
rejected the similar submissions of the defendant in same situation. The
judgments are as follow:-
> (i) In the case of Velcro Industries v. Velcro India Ltd. 1993 (1) Arb. LR
> 465, a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court (S.N. Variava, J.)
> rejected a contention made on behalf of the defendants therein that they are
> entitled to continue use of Velcro as a part of their corporate name because
> they have independently developed a reputation in India. It was noted that
> the defendants in that case were merely acting as licensees and even if the
> agreement between the parties did not provide that on termination of the
> license, the defendants would cease to use Velcro as a part of their trade
> name, that would make no difference, since the trademark Velcro is a
> registered trademark of the plaintiff and to allow the defendants to use it
> as a part of their corporate name is to permit them to give an impression to
> the public that they are still connected with or have a license from the
> plaintiffs.
71\. Transborder Reputation
(i) In the case of N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation, 1996 (16) PTC 585,
the appellants got registered the mark "Whirlpool" in respect of washing
machines. The Whirlpool Corporation filed a suit for passing off action
brought by the respondents to restrain the appellants from CS(OS) No.156/2012
& CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 51 of 72 manufacturing, selling, advertising or in
any way using the trade mark "Whirlpool" of their product. It was held that
the passing off an action was maintainable in law even against the registered
owner of the trademark. It was held that the name of "Whirlpool" was
associated for long with the Whirlpool Corporation and that its trans-border
reputation extended to India. It was held that the mark "Whirlpool" gave an
indication of the origin of the goods as emanating from or relating to the
Whirlpool Corporation. It was held that an injunction was a relief in equity
and was based on equitable principles. It was held that the equity required
that an injunction be granted in favour of the Whirlpool Corporation. It was
held that the refusal of an injunction could cause irreparable injury to the
reputation of the Whirlpool Corporation, whereas grant of an injunction would
cause no significant injury to the appellants who could sell their washing
machines merely by removing a small label bearing the name "Whirlpool".
(ii) In the case of Milment Oftho Industries & Ors. Vs. Allergan Inc, 2004
(28) PTC 585 (SC), the Apex Court in para 9 and 10 of the judgment held as
under:
> "9. We are in full agreement with what has been laid down by this Court.
> Whilst considering the possibility of likelihood of deception or confusion,
> in present times and particularly in the field of medicines, the Courts must
> also keep in mind the fact that nowadays the field of medicine is of an
> international character. The Court has to keep in mind the possibility that
> with the passage of time, some conflict may occur between the use of the
> mark by the Applicant in India and the user by the overseas company. The
> Court must ensure that public interest is in no way imperiled. Doctors
> particularly eminent doctors, medical practitioners and persons or Companies
> connected with medical field keep abreast of latest developments in medicine
> and preparations CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 52 of 72
> worldwide. Medical literature is freely available in this country. Doctors,
> medical practitioners and persons connected with the medical field regularly
> attend medical conferences, symposiums, lectures etc. It must also be
> remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised in newspapers,
> periodicals, magazines and other media which is available in the country.
> This results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark
> in respect of a drug is associated with the Respondents worldwide it would
> lead to an anomalous situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar
> drug is allowed to be sold in India. However one note of caution must be
> expressed. Multinational corporations, who have no intention of coming to
> India or introducing their product in India should not be allowed to
> throttle an Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a product in India,
> if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the mark and developed the
> product and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate test should be who is
> first in the market.
> 10\. In the present case, the marks are the same. They are in respect of
> pharmaceutical products. The mere fact that the Respondents have not been
> using the mark in India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world
> market. The Division Bench had relied upon material which prima-facie shows
> that the Respondents product was advertised before the Appellants entered
> the field. On the basis of that material the Division Bench has concluded
> that the Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If that be so then no
> fault can be found with the conclusion drawn by the Division Bench."
(iii) Yet in another landmark judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of
Baker Hughes Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Hiroo Khushlani & Anr., 2004 (29) PTC 153 (SC)
dealt with the same aspect and held as under in paras 3 to 6:
> "3. In 1994 Appellants sold their share in the 2nd Respondent Company and
> called upon the 2nd CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 53 of 72
> Respondent Company to stop use of the name "Baker". As 2nd Respondent
> refused to delete the name "Baker" from its Corporate name the Appellants
> filed the suit seeking an injunction against the Respondents from using the
> name 'Baker' as part of their corporate name or in any other manner. In the
> suit, the learned Single Judge granted an ad-interim injunction restraining
> the 2nd Respondent from using the name „Baker‟ as part of their corporate
> name. The 2nd Respondent-company has also been directed to make an
> application to the Registrar of Companies for deleting the name „Baker from
> its corporate name. In granting the above injunction, the learned Single
> Judge kept in mind well established principles which govern grant of
> injunction in an action of passing off. The learned Single Judge held that
> the Appellants had trans-border reputation and goodwill in the name in
> India. It was held that use of this name by the Respondents is likely to
> cause confusion and deception and that the Appellants would suffer damages
> if the interim relief was not granted.
> 4\. The Division Bench, by the impugned Judgment, has set aside the order of
> the learned Single Judge and vacated the interim injunction. The main ground
> on which the interim injunction has been vacated is that the right of the
> Appellants (herein) under Clause 8.3 of the Agreement dated 21.12.1984 was
> not enforceable. The Division Bench held that the Agreement had not been
> placed before the Government of India and was thus illegal and
> unenforceable.
> 5\. Prima facie, it appears to us that the Division Bench has erroneously
> interfered with the well reasoned judgment of the learned Single Judge. The
> application, which had been made by the 1st Respondent to the Government of
> India, itself shows that the Appellants had a very huge turnover, that they
> are regularly supplying equipment to parties in India. As per this letter
> they had reputation in India. At the interim stage this admission of the 1st
> Respondent had to be taken note of. The 2nd CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
> No.575/2012 Page 54 of 72 Respondent-company could thus use the name "baker"
> only if there was permission, or an Agreement, by which the Appellants
> permitted them to use the name „Baker‟. In the absence of any such Agreement
> or permission the 2nd Respondent would be guilty of passing off its goods as
> those of the Appellants and an injunction would have to follow on basis of
> well settled principles governing grant of injunction. It has to be
> remembered that the goods are identical The Technical Know-how Agreement
> does not contain any clause which permits user of the name "Baker", nor does
> the Technical Know-how Agreement contain any provision for grant of a 40%
> shareholding in the 2nd Respondent-company. These provisions are contained
> only in the Agreement dated 21 st December, 1984. The fact that the 2nd
> Respondent- company could be incorporated with the name "Baker" as part of
> its corporate name and the fact that 40% shareholding was given to the
> Appellants in the 2 nd Respondent Company prima facie shows that the
> Agreement dated 21st December, 1984 was acted upon and accepted even by the
> 2nd Respondent. The minutes of the Board Meeting held on 3rd September, 1993
> also prima facie shows that even on this date the Respondents accepted this
> Agreement to be binding.
> 6\. The execution of this Agreement is not denied by the Respondents. What
> has been claimed is that this Agreement was not to be acted upon and/or that
> as this Agreement was not put before the Government of India, the Agreement
> was illegal and unenforceable. This argument has found favour with the
> Division Bench. Prima fade, it appears to us that this is a self defeating
> argument If the Agreement was not to be acted upon, then there is no right
> in the 2nd Respondent company to use the name „Baker‟. In spite of questions
> from this Court no other permission or licence to use the name "Baker" could
> be shown to us. If the Agreement is unenforceable then the entire Agreement
> is unenforceable. In that case the 2nd Respondent has got no right to use
> the name "Baker". On the reasoning that CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
> No.575/2012 Page 55 of 72 this Agreement was illegal and unenforceable the
> interim injunction should have been confirmed. The goods being identical
> there was likelihood of confusion and/or deception if the Respondents were
> permitted to carry on using this name."
(iv) In the case of Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft and Another Vs. Hybo
Hindustan, AIR 1994 Delhi 239, a learned Single Judge of this Court, while
commenting upon the trans-border reputation of trade name „Benz‟, held as
follows:
> "In my view, the Trade Mark law is not intended to protect a person who
> deliberately sets out to take the benefit of somebody else's reputation with
> reference to goods, especially so when the reputation extends worldwide. By
> no stretch of imagination can it be said that use for any length of time of
> the name "Benz" should be not objected to."
(v) In Apple Computer Inc. Vs. Apple Leasing and Industries, (I.A. No.7678 of
1989 in Suit No.2751 of 1989, decided on May 10, 1991) it was held by this
Court that in order to prove a prima facie case for grant of interim
injunction it was not necessary for the plaintiff in a passing off action to
prove that it was carrying on business in India. For the grant of interim
injunction it was enough that the plaintiff had a reputation in India. In that
case the principle laid down in Budweiser's case (1984) FSR 413, namely, that
unless there was a business activity in the place where passing off was
alleged to have taken place, action for passing off could not be maintained,
was departed from. It was also recognised that there was a strong trend to
prevent deception of the public, whether it was deliberate or innocent. This
principle is more relevant to India because there is a greater need to catch
up with the more advanced countries in the matter of business enterprises
including manufacture of products and services. This CS(OS) No.156/2012 &
CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 56 of 72 can only be possible when a foreign trader
has the confidence that its trade mark/name will be safe and will not be
imitated. Transfer of technology and collaboration will get a big boost if
unfair competition is avoided and nobody is allowed to thrive at somebody
else's reputation and goodwill.
(vi) The Madras High Court in Haw Par Bros. International Ltd. Vs. Tiger Balm
Co. (P) Ltd. and Others, 1996 PTC (16) (DB) 311, on review of several
decisions of the various Courts agreed with the view taken by this Court on
the question of trans-border reputation. In Kamal Trading Co. Vs. Gillette UK
Ltd., Middle Sex, England, (1988) 1 P L R 135, the principle laid down by the
Budweiser's case was not accepted by a Division Bench of the Bombay High
Court. The Bombay High Court expressing its view held as follows:
> "It is necessary to note that the goodwill is not limited to a particular
> country because in the present days, the trade is spread all over the world
> and the goods are transported from one country to another very rapidly and
> on extensive scale. The goodwill acquired by the manufacturer is not
> necessarily limited to the country where the goods are freely available
> because the goods though not available are widely advertised in newspapers,
> periodicals, magazines and in other medias. The result is that though the
> goods are not available in the country, the goods and the mark under which
> they are sold acquires wide reputation. Take for example, the televisions,
> and Video Cassette Recorder manufactured by National, Sony or other well
> known Japanese concerns. These televisions and V.C.Rs. are not imported in
> India and sold in open market because of trade restrictions, but is it
> possible even to suggest that the word „National‟ or „Sony‟ has not acquired
> reputation in this country. In our judgment, the goodwill or reputation of
> goods or marks does not depend upon its availability in a particular
> country."
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 57 of 72
Plea of defendant, delay, latches, waiver and acquiesces on part of the
plaintiff in bringing the suit for infringement/passing off
72\. It is not denied by the defendant that the plaintiffs (including its
predecessor) had a business relationship with Defendant since its
incorporation in the year 1965. The plaintiffs and their predecessor entered
into several agreements with the defendant whereby defendant was given right
to use plaintiffs‟ trademarks subject to certain conditions and limitations.
72.1 It is a matter of record that the last License and Technical Service
Agreement with defendant was executed on 11th December, 1992 and had a term of
8 years and expired in the year 2000. This implies that defendant had
permission to use the words CUTLER-HAMMER till the year 2000.
72.2 In the year 2004, plaintiff no.1 filed Notice of Opposition to
defendant‟s application for registration of mark CUTLER-HAMMER bearing
No.1189782 in Class 09. On opposition being filed by the plaintiffs, defendant
was put to notice in the year 2004 itself. Any use after the notice being sent
to defendant was at its own risk and consequence. Amar Singh Chawla vs.
Rajdhani Roller Flour Mills Pvt. Ltd., 1990 PTC 220.
72.3 The plaintiff No.1 opposing registration of the mark CUTLER- HAMMER
(Device) subject matter of Application No.1189782, stopped using the impugned
arrangement/marks openly. It was only in the year 2011 at Hanover Fair,
Germany plaintiff found that the defendant's goods were being displayed in the
fair under the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER and/or .
72.4 Thereafter, Plaintiff approached a District Court, Braunschweig, CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 58 of 72 Germany and obtained a relief
of temporary injunction on 7th April, 2011 against defendant restraining them
to use the trademark CUTLER-
HAMMER and/or .
72.5 Thereafter, the defendant vide its letter dated 23rd August, 2011 gave
disclosure of information and indemnification of damages to avoid further
litigation. Defendant vide its letter dated 23rd August, 2011 accepted the
preliminary injunction and admitted that the use of marks by them was an
infringing act.
73\. It is the case of the plaintiffs that on 19 th December, 2011 the
defendant‟s goods under the impugned marks BHARTIA CUTLER- HAMMER and CH
(logo) were discovered from the market against a cash memo. Plaintiffs also
obtained the price list of defendant‟s products printed in the year 2011 from
one of their distributor and noticed that defendant continued use of the
impugned arrangement/ marks CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH (logo)
on their products. Caution notice was published by Plaintiff No.1 in respect
of trademark CUTLER- HAMMER. On 6th January, 2012, Cease & Desist notice was
sent by Plaintiff No.1 to Defendant. On 18th January, 2012, Plaintiff filed
suit for infringement and passing off against defendant being CS(OS)
No.156/2012.
74\. From the above, it is clear that there has been no acquiescence on part
of plaintiffs. As all agreements pertaining to trademark rights executed
between the parties had specific clauses pertaining to trademark rights which
specify that:
> i. Plaintiff No.1 and its predecessor is the registered proprietor of the
> trademarks;
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 59 of 72
> ii. The defendant cannot claim any right over the said trademarks by virtue
> of permitted use of trademarks; iii. The Defendant will not attempt to
> secure statutory rights in the said trademarks.
75\. It is settled law that where there is fraud, there is no room for
doctrine of acquiescence to operate. The acquiescence cannot be inferred
merely by reason of the fact that the plaintiff has not taken any action
against the infringement of its rights. Even if the defendant has been using
both the trademarks from the period when the relation between the parties are
broken. Is it possible that the defendant would and could take any benefit out
of it knowing the said trademarks are belonging to the plaintiffs? Can the
defendant in the facts of the present case is entitled to take the defence of
estoppel, acquiesces, delay, latches and abandonment of the same trade marks
by the plaintiff?
76\. This aspect has been dealt with by the Division Bench of this Court in
the case of Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Synthes Ag Chur, 1997 (17) PTC (DB)
as under:
> "Estoppel, Acquiescence, delay & laches.

ABANDONMENT OF TRADE MARK:
77\. Though, there is Section 102 of the Act relating to abandonment, it is
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 62 of 72 confined to abandonment
of an application for registration of Trade Mark and it is not applicable to
the present situation. Consequently, one has to revert back to common law
rules.
However, here, in view of the peculiar circumstances and non-user of the trade
mark in India by the respondents and plaintiffs Nos. 1 and 2 themselves, the
question of abandonment is also required to be seen.
Question of abandonment depends on determining the intention to be inferred
from the facts of each case. While a mere non-user for a few years may not
amount to abandonment of a trademark if referable to accountable facts, a long
unexplained non user may suggest an intention to abandon the mark. (See
Whirlpool Company & Anr. v. N.R. Dongre & Ors., 1995 (32) DRJ 318).
However, it may be mentioned that a Division Bench of Calcutta High Court in
J. N. Nicols (Vimto) Limited v. Rose & Thistle & Anr., AIR 1994 Calcutta 43
took the view that where an application for removal of registered trade mark
was filed for non-user of the same for a long period, the defense of import
ban as special circumstance for the said non-user cannot be granted when other
similar product was manufactured and freely sold during that period in spite
of the import restriction. Hence the onus has not been discharged by the
registered proprietor of trade mark for excusing him from non-user during the
prescribed period, preceding the application for removal of registered mark.
The existence of special circumstance must affect the trade as a whole and the
onus of establishing that the case comes within the ambit of Section 46(3)
lies on the registered proprietor of the trade mark. It may be shown that the
non-user was due to special circumstance of the trade only and not by reason
of some other cause which CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 63 of
72 would have otherwise been inoperative even in the absence of the special
circumstances. If the non-user was, in fact, by reason of some other factors
apart from the special circumstances, question of a defense under Section
46(3) being made available to the proprietor of the mark does not and cannot
arise. A specific case shall have to be made and proved with necessary
documentary evidence that the non-user was the direct effect of the existence
of the special circumstances. The special circumstances cannot be taken note
of as a defense if the non-user is by reason of a voluntary act. This view
taken by Calcutta High Court might have helped the proceedings under Section
46 of the Act. But here in this case due to special kind of relationship
between the respondents No.1 and 2 and between respondent No.2 and the
appellant in the trade and there being no intention to abandon or not to use
the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the registration of the trade
mark related, the appellant even for that purpose is not entitled to claim
removal from register of the trade mark the device and word "Synthes" on the
ground of alleged non-user. In the present case, the question of abandonment
has to be judged in the peculiar set of facts. Here the plaintiff/respondent
No.1 is one who is not indulging in any trading activities not only in India
but also outside India. The plaintiff/respondent No.2 does not have any
registration as registered user of the trade marks in India. It is not the
case here where the trade mark has not been got renewed by
plaintiff/respondent No.1. It is different thing to look at the situation from
the point of view of trafficking in trade marks. But in the face of renewal of
the trade mark and allowing the plaintiff/respondent No.2 to use the same
exclusively and further tacitly allowing the appellant to use it, it is
difficult rather not possible to say that the trade mark in this case has been
abandoned."

> (Emphasis supplied) DELAY
79\. The defendant has intentionally and deliberately claimed the false user
of marks CUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH from several decades".
The defendant has claimed use of the trademark CUTLER HAMMER from the year
1968 and other marks from the year 1977 and has produced on record the Sales
figures along with Certificate of Chartered Accountant from the year 1976-
2010 are wrong and not substantiated by any documentary evidence. It is the
admitted position that during the said period the user of defendant was
permissive user. The claiming user being proprietor during the licensing
period was fraudulent and dishonest as per settled law.
Even false claims made by defendant as to "advertisement and promotion of
products under marks CUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH from the year
1976-2011". In most of the period, the defendant‟s user was permissive user.
80\. In Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd. v. Synthes Ag Chur, 1997 (17) PTC 669 (DB),
this Court echoed the view expressed by the Supreme Court in Power Control
Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd., JT 1994 (2) SC 17 to the effect that
it is a settled principle of law relating to trademarks that there can be only
one mark, one source and one proprietor. A trademark cannot have two origins.
It was held that after termination of the collaboration agreement between the
parties to that litigation, the appellant CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS)
No.575/2012 Page 66 of 72 therein, not the owner of the trademark, could not
use the word "Synthes" or the trademark "AO/ASIF" after revocation of the
collaboration agreement.
The Division Bench of this Court in the case of J.K. Jain v. Ziff Davies, 2000
PTC 244 (DB) held that an ex licensee, having taken the benefit of an
agreement with the licensor is estopped from resisting an application for an
injunction by the licensor after termination of the agreement between the
parties.
81\. In the case of Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s India Stationery
Products Co., reported in AIR 1990 Delhi 19, in para-31 it was held as under:
> "31. Even though there may be some doubt as to whether laces or acquiescence
> can deny the relief of a permanent injunction, judicial opinion has been
> consistent in holding that if the defendant acts fraudulently with the
> knowledge that he is violating the plaintiff s rights then in that case,
> even if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking
> action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is not denied. The
> defense of laces or inordinate delay is a defense in equity. Inequity both

> guilty of violating the law or infringing or usurping somebody else's right
> cannot clarify the continued misuse of the usurped right. It was observed by
> Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought be J. R. Parkington and
> Co. Ld., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at page 181 that "in my judgment, the
> circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first
> instance are of considerable importance when one comes to consider whether

> he CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 67 of 72 could not regard
> the discreditable origin of the user as cleansed by the subsequent history.
> In other words, the equitable relief will be afforded only to that party who

> The Court would be justified in concluding that the defendant, in such an
> action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiffs name and reputation and that was
> the sole, primary or the real motive of the defendant adopting such a mark.
> Even if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay on the part of the
> plaintiff in bringing a suit for injunction, the application of the
> plaintiff for an interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground that
> the defendant has been using the mark for a number of years. Dealing with
> this aspect Harry D. Nims in his "The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade
> Marks", Fourth Edition, Volume Two at page 1282 noted as follows:
> "Where infringement is deliberate and willful and the defendant acts
> fraudulently with knowledge that he is violating plaintiffs rights,
> essential elements of estoppels are lacking and in such a case the
> protection of plaintiffs rights by injunctive relief never is properly
> denied. "The doctrine of estoppels can only be invoked to promote fair
> dealings"."
> 82\. In the case of Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sudhir Bhatia and
> Others, reported in 2004 (Vol.28) PTC 121, relevant para-5 of the said
> judgment is as under:
> "5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either
> of Trade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay
> in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of CS(OS) No.156/2012 &
> CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 68 of 72 injunction in such cases. The grant of
> injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the
> adoption of the Mark was itself dishonest."
> 83\. In the case of Fedders North American vs. Show Line and Ors., 2006(32)
> PTC 573 Del, decided by Hon‟ble Mr. Justice Madan B. Lokur, in the similar
> facts wherein the defendant claimed the users of the trademark „Fedders‟
> more than 40-50 years. The Hon‟ble Court still granted the injunction,
> inter-alia, on the reasons that it is recurring cause of action and the
> defendant had no answer how to claim the right of the trademark „Fedders‟.
> The defendant cannot be permitted to take advantage of the laws of delays.
> Both parties know where they stand.
84\. None of the cases referred by the defendant is applicable to the facts
and circumstances of the present case. The defendant‟s counsel has failed to
refer even a single case in which the injunction has been refused by any Court
with similar circumstances. The facts in cases referred are materially
different and do not help the case of the defendant.
85\. Rather, in case the law with regard to the rightful owner of the
trademark and the act of ex-licensee is examined, it emerges that either
during the licensing period of agreement or after expiry, it is implicit and
clear that the ex-licensee is not entitled to claim the ownership of a
trademark nor he is permitted by law to file an application for registration
of the trademark in his name nor is entitled to file the petition for
rectification of the same very trademarks in which ex-licensee was using the
trademarks as a permissive user, otherwise it would amount to fraud and
misrepresentation. The ex-licensee under no circumstances can declare himself
as owner of the trademark to claim the concurrent user because as per scheme
of the Act, the benefit of concurrent user can be derived by a CS(OS)
No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 69 of 72 party whose user is honest and
boanfide. In the present case, both things are missing. In other words, he
cannot be allowed to make a hole in the plate in which he was eating; such
wrongful user would be considered as stolen property which cannot become
rightful property in any amount of user.
BALANCE OF CONVIENCE IN FAVOUR OF PLAINTIFF
86\. Plaintiff No.1 founded in 1911 and incorporated in Ohio in 1916 is a well
known premier diversified fortune 200 industrial company having a
manufacturing presence in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czech
Republic, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rica,
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand,
United Kingdom and United States of America and has been selling their
products under various well known trademarks.
85.1 Plaintiffs‟ trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER/CH logo are well known trademarks
having extra territorial goodwill and reputation worldwide. Plaintiff No.1 has
trans-border reputation extending to India. The use of identical/ deceptively
similar trademarks on part of Defendant is bound to confer an undue advantage
of reputation and goodwill of plaintiffs‟ well known marks to the defendant
and such use would be detrimental to the well known character and reputation
thereof. The plaintiffs are the registered proprietor of trademark CUTLER-
HAMMER under No.164435 in Class 09. Whereas the defendant does not have any
statutory right in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and its
variants.
85.2 The plaintiffs have been using the trademarks worldwide and there is no
reason to assume that the same were abandoned. Mere fact that the
registrations of few trademarks inadvertently lapsed and then no steps were
CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 70 of 72 taken to reinstate the
said registration on account of adopting the new version of it, the same is no
ground to claim that plaintiffs have abandoned the trademarks.
85.3 The fact that the defendant until the year 2000 has manufactured license
products using plaintiff‟s know how and technical data and for which Defendant
has paid royalties as well itself supports that defendant cannot on its own
manufacture goods of same engineering standard even if the defendant is using
the marks since the year 1986 with the knowledge of the plaintiffs, such user
will always be considered as dishonest and fraudulent.
87\. The plaintiffs establish a prima facie case for grant of an interim
injunction. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs and
against the defendant. The plaintiffs shall suffer an irreparable loss and
injury to its hard earned goodwill, reputation and business unless the
defendant is restrained from continuing with its illegal trade activities
during the pendency of the suit.
RELIEF
88\. In view of the above said reasons, the prayer made in the plaintiffs‟
application being I.A.No.1204/2012 is allowed. Accordingly, the defendant, its
dealers, agents and representatives on its behalf are restrained from using
impugned arrangement and/or mark(s) CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,
CH(logo) or CH CONTROL or any other mark as may be identical and/or
deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER
under No.164435 in Class 9 amounting to infringement thereof and also from
manufacturing and selling, offering for sale, directly or indirectly dealing
in goods included in Class 9 and/or any other cognate or allied goods or the
goods of the CS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012 Page 71 of 72 same
description under the impugned arrangement and/or mark(s) CUTLER-HAMMER,
BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH (logo) or CH CONTROL or any other mark as may be
identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ trade mark CUTLER-
HAMMER and CH (label) and from doing any other act as is likely to cause
confusion & deception amounting to passing off their goods and/or business as
and for the goods and/or business of the plaintiffs. However, the defendant is
granted three months‟ time to dispose of the existing stock lying with it.
89\. With regard to the defendant‟s application being I.A.No.4318/2012 filed
in CS(OS) No.575/2012, the same is dismissed being not maintainable in view of
the facts and circumstances of the present case as well as under the statute
provisions of Section 142 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as the plaintiff No.1
who is the proprietor of the trademarks with due diligence has commenced the
action against the defendant.
90\. It is made clarified that the findings arrived in this order are
tentative and shall not come in the way when the matters would be decided
after trial.
91\. The defendant is also burdened with cost of `1 lac which shall be
deposited by the defendant with the Prime Minister‟s Relief Fund within four
weeks from today.
92\. Both I.A.Nos.1204/2012 & 4318/2012 are disposed of.
93\. List the matters on 23rd August, 2013 before the roster Bench for further
