1908 for the following prayers:

2\. Factual Remarks:
The present Respondents - Original Plaintiffs have preferred Civil Suit No.
884/2020 in the Ahmedabad City Civil Court at Ahmedabad, inter- alia, praying
for permanent injunction restraining the defendant and its agents from
manufacturing, marketing advertising for Sales, the defendant's products under
the Trademark /Label "VIMAL" "TM Application No. 4352164 including its Art
Work, Colour Scheme, Get- up, Arrangement and/or any other Label, which is
substantial and  Page 3 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT material reproduction of the label of the plaintiffs
from committing an act of infringement of plaintiff's copy right registered
label bearing No. A- 118473 / 20177 under the Copy Right Act. Plaintiffs also
prayed to restrain the defendant from committing an act of infringement of the
plaintiff's registered Trademark/labels and from committing an act of passing
of the plaintiffs' trademarks/labels. Plaintiffs further prayed for directions
to the defendant to give true and correct accounts of the goods manufactured
and marketed by them under the trademark /label VIMAL and after verifying the
accounts and deriving at the amount of the profit earned by the defendant, to
pay the said amount with 18% interest. The suit is essentially filed for
permanent injunction and seeking damages. Respondents herein - Original
Plaintiffs have filed an application for Temporary Injunction along with the
suit under Order XXXIX Rule-1(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 with
similar reliefs prayed in the suit.
3\. The Appellant / Original Defendant states and submits that the gist of the
case of the plaintiffs can be described in nutshell to the effect that
plaintiffs are using the trademark 'WAGH BAKRI' and they have acquired wide
reputation and goodwill in the Tea Business. It is further the case of
plaintiffs that they have been using and publishing various  Page 4 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT labels
containing the word 'WAGH BAKRI' as per the demand of the business. In view of
the such demand, plaintiff No. 1 has first published one label / wrapper in
the year 2013 in India under the title "WAGH BAKRI' Strong and Refreshing
Premium Leaf Tea in English and Hindi languages and since, then plaintiffs are
the first owners of the copy right of that Artistic work of the said label
/trademark. The said label is having distinct colour scheme, get up and
arrangement and as such, that arrangement are the material portions of the
said label of plaintiffs. It is further the case of the plaintiffs that
defendant has copied substantial and material reproduction of the Artistic
work of the label of plaintiffs and thereby the defendant is committing an act
of infringement of copyright under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957.
It is further the case of plaintiffs that defendant has applied for the
trademark on 19.11.2019 and legal notice was issued, which was replied by the
defendant. Thereafter the present suit came to be filed.
Appellant herein- original defendant appeared and filed reply at Exh. 16 to
the injunction application and also tendered list of documents, several
judgments along with the written arguments.
4\. It is the case of the defendant that Vimal Dairy Limited belongs to the
well-known, well established and diversified popularly known as Vimal Group in
Gujarat and other States. Vimal Group is actively engaged in the diversified
activities of manufacturing and marketing of a  Page 5 of 124 Downloaded on :
Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT wide spectrum of
products like Edible Refined Oils/De-Oiled Cakes, Milk and Milk products, Tea,
Ice -Creams, Cables and Winding wires, Capacitors and Transformers,
Submersible Pumps, Resings and Paints, Micronized Mineral Powder, Ceramic
Tiles, Solar Panels etc. It is the case of the defendant that the company has
acquired tremendous goodwill and market reputation among the trade, public and
ultimate customers at large. Ii is further the case of the Appellant /
Original Defendant that since inception of its business, the Appellant /
Defendant Company is continuously, extensively, and uninterruptedly using the
trademark and trade name VIMAL. It is further the case of the defendant that
the suit filed by plaintiffs is devoid of merits on the ground that the
defendant company is prominently using the trademark and trade name 'VIMAL'
and not 'WAGH BAKRI'. It is further the case of the defendant that plaintiff's
and defendants products are identified by their trade name respectively and
the public at large identifies the goods of plaintiffs and defendant by their
brand names or trade names. It is further the case of the defendant that there
are various Tea brands in India, which are using Red, Blue and Green Colour as
their label for the goods to describe the character, quality and intended
purpose of the product. The goods such as Tea are never procured based on
colour combination. Plaintiffs cannot claim exclusive right over the colours.
It is further the case of the defendant that from the depiction in the labels,
that the artwork, lay out,  Page 6 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41
IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT getup and colour scheme are entirely
different. Plaintiffs colour scheme is having saffron background along with
essential feature of its mark i.e. 'WAGH BAKRI'. That public or consumers at
large identify products with brand name 'WAGH BAKRI' and not through the get
up, dress / packaging of the product. On the other hand, defendant's colour
scheme is having dark orange background along with essential feature of its
trade mark i.e. 'VIMAL'. There is an artwork of depiction of Tea Gardens in
the backgrounds of the defendants trademark. It is further the case of the
defendant that there are various traders who are using the above colour
combination packaging to describe their tea product. It is further a case of
the defendant that company is using the trademark / trade name 'VIMAL' in Red
and White since the inception of the business. It is further the case of the
defendant that the Orange colour used by the defendant company is a common
colour and a naturally occurring colour in which no person can claim exclusive
right on it. It is further the case of the defendant that both the marks are
not phonetically similar. That 'VIMAL' and 'WAGH BAKRI' are phonetically,
visually, conceptually, and structurally different from each other and there
cannot be deception and confusion in the minds of consumers. Appellant states
and submits that with the above and other several contentions, reply has been
filed at Exh. 16 by the defendant.

JUDGMENT
5\. It is further contended that the learned City Civil Court No. 29,
Ahmedabad, without appreciating the provisions of Trademarks Act, Copy Right
Act in its true perspective and without appreciating the evidence on record
and without considering the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Courts in the
judgments cited, has been pleased to allow the Notice of Motion at Exh. 7 by
order dated 11.12.2020 and was further pleased to grant interim injunction as
prayed for in terms of Para - 85(A), (B) and (C) against the defendant. The
interim relief granted is in the nature of final relief.
6\. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order of below Exh. 7 dated
11.12.2020 passed by the City Civil Court No. 29, Ahmedabad, the appellant
herein, begs to prefer the present Appeal from Order under Order -XLIII Rule-
1(r) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
    (C)    Arguments of Both sides:
    7.     Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for Appellant                         /
Original Defendant has submitted that the order passed by the learned trial
Court is ex-facie, illegal, against the provisions of the Trademark Act and
copyright Act and against the evidence on the record and therefore, requires
to be quashed and set-aside. He further submitted that the learned trial Court
has been pleased to grant temporary injunction in terms of  Page 8 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
Paragraph - 85(A),(B) and (C) of the application, which is similarly worded as
per the main relief in th suit in paragraph 85(A),(B) and (C) with the only
exception that in the suit it was prayed for a permanent injunction whereas in
the interim injunction application it was prayed for temporary injunction. It
is respectfully submitted that relief granted by the learned trial Court is in
the nature of final relief and nothing further remained in the suit. It is
settled proposition of law that at interim stage relief cannot be granted
which is in the nature of final relief.
8\. It is further contended that the learned trial Court, after recording the
contentions of both the parties, did not frame issues to grant temporary
injunction. Not only that, but there is no separate finding recorded qua the
three main ingredients. It is settled proposition of law that the discretion
of the Court is exercised to grant a temporary injunction only when the
requirements of existence of prima facie case, balance of convenience and
irreparable loss are satisfied. It is incumbent upon the learned trial Court
to record findings on each issue while appreciating the contention of
plaintiffs and the defendant.
9\. That learned advocate for the appellant submitted that there are following
glaring defects surfacing in the order of interim injunction, which can be
described in nutshell as under:-
Page 9 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT (A) The learned Trial Court has recorded the contentions of
plaintiffs and defendant and various paragraphs of various judgments without
recording the findings on the contentions raised by the parties. (B) The
learned trial Court has repoduced from page No. 42 to 65 and page - 68 to 91
only various paragraphs of judgments, without considerign its relevancy and
thereby has given a bulky judgment without any cogent reasons.
(C) The learned trial Court has recorded the contentions of defendant from
para 58 to 60, which is the main subject matter about using of similar colour
on the packaging. Somehow, there is no finding recorded qua those important
contentions raised in the above paragraphs and it remained unanswered.
(D) The finding was recorded in para-82 to the effect that, "This Court is of
the prima facie opinion that plaintiffs have clearly established the essential
ingredients namely, prior use, establishment of goodwill and reputation and
chance of future loss by virtue of the use of such deceptively similar trade
name or device and therefore, plaintiffs have prima facie case in their
favour". It is an admitted fact that the trade  Page 10 of 124 Downloaded on :
Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT name of both the parties
are not deceptively similar and distinctly different i.e. WAGH BAKRI AND
VIMAL. Looking to the above findings, it is clear that what is considered is
beyond the pleadings of parties. Therefore, it shows non-application of mind
at the ends of entire discussion in the judgment.
(E) The learned trial court has committed grave error in observing that the
defendant has not been able to produce any cogent evidence to establish that
other parties were also using such colour scheme. It is submitted that the
defendant has produced as many as 19 colour wrappers of different companies /
tea vendors to show that they are using Orange colour for their packaging.
10\. Learned Advocate for the Applicant has submitted that the learned trial
court has committed a grave error in observing that the defendant has not been
able to produce any cogent and clear evidence before this court to establish
that third parties have been using the mark 'WAGH BAKRI' along with its colour
scheme, get up, arrangement etc. It is further submitted by the learned
Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant that the Appellant has
produced as many as 19 colour wrappers of different companies / Tea vendors to
show that they are using orange colour for their packaging and that the said
evidence is discarded by  Page 11 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41
IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT raising suspicion that whether those parties
are still using the mark in question and prior to the use of plaintiffs.
Rightly so, they cannot claim exclusive right over orange as it is naturally
occurring colour. The colour orange is not a coined and inventive colour which
is a most important factor in claiming exclusivity in intellectual property
rights and therefore the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs cannot restrain the
present Appellant from using orange colour on the package of Tea produced by
the Appellant.
(D) Infringement of Copyright:
11\. It is submitted that the label is not artistic work. No reputation or
goodwill attached with the label but reputation is with trade name WAGHBAKRI.
Label is also not an artistic work under Section 2(c) because, it is neither a
painting nor sculpture nor a drawing nor photograph. It is merely a package
prepared in computer. There cannot be an artistic work in a Orange Colour
background and therefor since 'Orange Colour' cannot be terms as artistic
work, any allegation of infringement of Copyright would not be maintainable.
12\. It is submitted that Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant has copied
colour scheme, however it is pertinent to note that the label of Plaintiff
does not contain any colour scheme, as it is sought to be  Page 12 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
canvassed by the plaintiff and in fact the back ground is composed of only one
colour, which cannot be said to be Artistic Work as per section 2(c) of
Copyright Act. It is respectfully submitted that there is no artistic work in
colour Orange. The logo of men with Goat and Tiger can be termed as an
artistic work but not Orange colour or Cup or a Saucer. The orange colour, Cup
and Saucer indicate that tea product is sold, which is commonly used by all
tea traders and manufacturers. The literature as well as pictorial depiction
in both the label are different, hence, the say of the Plaintiffs that, the
defendant has committed infringement of Copyright is factually wrong.
13\. It is submitted that plaintiffs have adopted many labels over the years.
This particular label is in use only since 2020 as it is evident from the
registration certificate. Therefore, there is no goodwill and reputation
attached to this label.
14\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant has drawn the
attention of this Court on Infringement of Trademark: It is submitted that
trademarks bearing registration no. 3075599, 4250078, 4250077 and 4250071 are
pertaining to the 'WAGH BAKRI' and 'WAGH BAKRI STRONG AND REFRESHING PREMIUM
TEA',  Page 13 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021
CAV JUDGMENT however, there is no trademark for the colour scheme and
therefore no registration of colour orange or for colour scheme in favour of
Plaintiffs. Even otherwise 'orange colour' as a single colour is not capable
of being considered as 'Trademark' and therefore plaintiffs are not entitled
to institute suit for infringement of the such trademark.
15\. That looking to the format of application of registration of trademark,
it is evident that there are six options i.e. colour, device, shape of goods,
sound, three dimensional work, work mark. It is an admitted fact that there is
no registration of trademark in the category of "Colour". Not a single
registration certificate is produced by the plaintiff showing that they have
any registration of trademark in the category of Orange Colour.
16\. It is submitted that under section 29, suit for infringement of trademark
is permissible only if there is a use of such trademark in the course of trade
and therefore when the suit is based on the apprehension, no cause of action
has yet arisen for the plaintiffs to bring the suit and therefore said suit is
not maintainable for lack of cause of action. In case where there is no cause
of action for the suit, no injunction can be granted in favour of plaintiffs.
Page 14 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT
17\. Even otherwise there is no likelihood of customers being deceived or
confused as the trading style/trademark of both the parties are different and
hence public is made completely aware regarding the source of origin of
packaging. It is submitted that tea is considered to be addictive food item
and therefore regular user would purchase tea by their brand names and not by
the colour scheme and therefore also there is no likelihood of confusion or
deception as alleged by the Plaintiffs.
18\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has further drawn the attention of
this this court on the Passing off Action:
It is submitted that passing off action is a remedy provided for the
protection of goodwill and reputation of the particular business. It is
submitted that as can be seen from the registered trademark of the plaintiffs,
the only reputation and goodwill that is claimed by the Plaintiffs, pertains
to 'WAGH BAKRI' and therefore no passing off action would be maintainable as
trade names of both the parties are totally different. It is submitted that
plaintiffs have not produced any document to prove that there is any goodwill
in 'orange' colour and therefore no passing off action would be maintainable
for the orange  Page 15 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT colour.
It is respectfully submitted that Orange colour is generic in nature; there
can be no exclusive rights for generic colour scheme as well as the get- up,
which is commonly used in the market by all the tea companies. Therefore, the
argument of the plaintiffs about unique get-up, leaf or cup and saucer on the
label are not tenable as they are not coined or invented in nature by the
plaintiffs. It cannot be considered as an essential feature for the
plaintiffs' trademark as it is totally against Section 9 of the Act. Learned
Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant has submitted that that
generic, descriptive, and common words cannot be protected unless and until it
has acquired a secondary meaning. The customer will ask for a product from the
name of the product and not from the colour of the product. Plaintiffs cannot
claim their exclusive right on the features, which are description, commonly
used not coined or invented in nature. (E) Legal Aspects by the Learned
Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah, for the Appellant / Original Defendant:
19\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant has placed
reliance on the following judgments and submitted as under:  Page 16 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
(i) Britannia Industries Ltd. Vs. ITC Limited, reported in 2017(70) PTC p. 66
- more particularly referred to paragraph nos. 1, 2, 9, 19, 22, 23 and 24.
Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that in paragraph no. 23, it
is observed as under:
> "the appropriation of an exclusivity claimed vis-à-vis a get-
> up and particularly a colouor combination stands on a different footing from
> a trade mark or a trade name because, colours and colour combinations are
> not inherently distinctively. It should, therefore, not be easy for a person
> to claim exclusivity over a colour combination particularly when the same
> has been in use only for a short while".
(ii) Cipla Limited Vs. M.K. Pharmaceuticals, reported in 2008 (36) PTC, 166 -
He has submitted that the court in paragraph 5 has observed as under:
> "Whether defendant can copy the colour of plaintiffs' tablets and shape of
> the plaintiffs' tablets? It is settled law that there can be no monopoly
> over colours. Merely because plaintiff has started using a particular colour
> for its tablets, plaintiff does not get monopoly over colour so that no one
> else can use that colour. The medicines are not bought by colours by the

(iii) Colgate Palmolive Company Vs. Patel & others reported in 2005 Law Suits
(Delhi) 1540 - He has referred to paragraph Nos. 25, 29, 31, 33, 41, 42 and
submitted that the Hon'ble Court has observed in paragraph nos. 31 and 32 as
under:
> ".....In the instant case too the colour combination of red and white on its
> own, does not identify the source of the product since the red and white
> colour combination is quite generic in nature and common to toothpaste trade
> as demonstrated by the various products and their labels relied upon by the
> defendant. Moreover, there is nothing innovative or distinctive in using the
> "colour white" for writing the word mark "COLGATE', since white is a colour
> commonly used for writing Alphabets/Numerals on coloured backgrounds.
> 32\. ...... The defendants had contended that in the toothpaste trade the
> colour combination of red and white is common to the trade. The defendant
> had given a list of 16 Indian and 8 international toothpastes along with
> their annexed labels to establish the common occurrence of red colour as
> well as red and white colour combination in the toothpaste industry.
> Furthermore, it is the plaintiff who has claimed that it is a world leader

> 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT to its worldwide presence in

> denied, the defendants have in my view prima facie established that colour

> internationally. The fact that some of the brands have a negligible presence
> in the Indian market or have been sued by the plaintiff or are under a
> settlement with the plaintiff, still does not detract from the fact that the
> colour red and the red and white colour combination are common to the
> toothpaste trade."
> (iv) AIR 1996, HP, 70 - Amrit Banaspati Company Limited v. Surat Industries
> Limited. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has drawn the attention of
> this court to paragraphs 26, 36, 41 and submitted that the Hon'ble Court has
> observed in paragraph 36 as under:
> "simply because the colour of the two pouches was dark blue and the writing
> on those pouches are in white colour, will not make the pouches to be of
> similar nature, even prima facie. Insofar as the use of this blue colour is
> there, it is not prohibited. The defendants have brought on record samples

> blue colour on record being used by other concerns."
> 20\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant has therefore
> submitted that after discussing various aspects, the Hon'ble High Court
> refused to grant any temporary injunction.
21\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has therefore submitted that as held by the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of 'Colgate Palmolive Company vs. Patel &
Ors. (supra); 'orange' colour in itself cannot be considered to be a essential
and/or distinctive feature capable of being monopolized by the Plaintiffs
exclusively and therefore Ld. Trial Court ought to have appreciated that
merely because a generic colour has been adopted, it cannot be said that there
is a prima facie case for passing off when said colour is not capable of being
considered as distinctive feature.
22\. It is further submitted that similarly, as far as the tea manufacturing
companies are concerned, an image of 'cup', 'saucer' and 'tea leaves' are
nothing but generic features and therefore they are also incapable of being
considered as the essential/distinctive feature and therefore also there
cannot be any case for passing off merely because of adoption of the same. As
against the same, trade names of the both the parties and their symbol are
admittedly distinctive and same can be considered as  Page 20 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
essential feature of the overall trade dress and therefore when the essential
feature of the trade dress are different, learned Trial Court ought not to
have granted interim injunction more particularly when present is the case of
passing off and not of the trademark infringement.
23\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has further drawn the attention of
this court to Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 15 th Edition (P.
652);
> "It is usually true in some degree that a trader's goods are recognised as
> his by their general appearance, or "get-up". Accordingly, resemblance of
> get-up is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off, and it is possible
> for imitation of get-up alone to amount to passing off. Such cases are rare,
> since few traders rely on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that
> trade names and word trade marks are ordinarily present too, and in these

24\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has submitted that the Hon'ble Madras High
Court in the case of Parle Products Limited v. Bakemans Industries Limited,
1998 (2) ARBLR 583 has held that;
> "Had there been no injunction, the defendant/respondent's business would

> No. 144 of 1998 is dismissed. Ad-interim injunction granted is vacated.
> Parties to bear their respective costs."
And, further in the case of Amrit Banaspati Company Limited v. Suraj
Industries Limited (supra), the Hon'ble Court has observed as under;
> "41\. On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, first of all the plaintiffs
> have not been able to prove prima facie case in their favour for an action

25\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has submitted that unlike trademark
infringement, case of passing off has to be established through evidence in
the trial and therefore the learned Trial Court ought not to have granted
injunction as not only prima facie case was yet to be proved but also the
balance of convenience was in the favour of present Appellant as any alleged
injury caused to Plaintiffs could be easily restituted by the monetary
compensation while injunction to Appellant will cause irreparable loss. It is
submitted that the impugned order has not considered factors of balance of
convenience as well as irreparable loss in appropriate way and therefore also
same is required to be quashed and set aside.

JUDGMENT
26\. It is submitted that, it is pertinent to note that trademark infringement
cases relied upon by the Respondents in their affidavit in reply to the civil
application, pertains to the cases where not only the trade-dress was similar
but also trade name of the businesses were also phonetically or actually
similar and therefore ratio laid down in said cases would not be applicable as
in the present case not only the trade names of the parties are different but
also essential features are different.
27\. It is further submitted that the fact that admittedly there is presence
of other brands having trade-dress of the orange colour and Plaintiffs have
not initiated any proceedings against them successfully for restraining use of
'orange' colour clearly shows that Plaintiffs/Respondents themselves have
never considered the same as being essential feature on its own. Therefore,
the action of Respondents to seek only restrain against the Appellant clearly
shows that same is nothing but intentional stifling of valid competition from
Appellant, which is against the public policy and requires to be deprecated.

JUDGMENT
28\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has further submitted that various
judgments relied upon by the original plaintiffs - respondent herein are not
applicable to the facts of the present case. Most of the judgments are
pertaining to the word 'mark' and not pertaining to 'similar colour can be
used or not'.
29\. It is submitted that Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Cadila
Healthcare v. Cadila Pharmaceutical 2001 (2) PTC 541 SC has only rejected
adoption of the English principles regarding the weightage to be given to the
dissimilarities, however, Hon'ble Supreme Court has not stated that principles
concerning the colour combination as laid down in various English judgment
would not be relevant for the Indian jurisdiction. On the contrary, in
paragraph 33 (page no. 211) of the said judgment, Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
said judgment itself has stated that the English cases would be relevant in
understanding essential feature and therefore considering the long line of
English as well as American judgments as narrated in the commentary of Kerly's
Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names and narrated by various Hon'ble High Court
(i.e. Britania Industries v. ITC Ltd.) it is clear that it would be very
difficult for anyone to claim passing off solely on the basis of colour
combination as essential feature. In such circumstances, Ld. Trial Court ought
to have appreciated that Respondents have no prima facie case of  Page 25 of
124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
passing off and therefore injunction ought not to have been granted.
30\. It is submitted that the goods under consideration is not ordinary tea
which is sold in lose form to the general public but it is a premium variety
of the tea targeted towards the middle as well as upper-middle class people
who will be aware of the 'WAGHBAKRI' and 'VIMAL' as two different brands as
both of them have distinct identity and therefore considering the nature of
goods as well as targeted audience also there is no possibility of passing off
as alleged by the Respondents. 31 Learned Advocate for the Appellant has
further submitted that the learned Trial Court has not considered and provided
reasoning and / or its findings on various contentions raised by the Appellant
and thereby committed serious error in fact and law.
32\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that the learned Trial
Court did not framed issue at least to discuss and appreciate the basic
ingredients of granting temporary injunction i.e. prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss. There is no discussion in the entire
judgment with the perspective of the above ingredients and only before the
operative order straightway finding was recorded qua these ingredients. It is
mandatory on the part of the learned trial court to record  Page 26 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT its
reasons qua prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss
while granting temporary injunction application, which is totally lacking in
the present order and therefore, such unreasoned order is not sustainable in
the eye of law.
33\. It is further submitted that the learned Trial Court has recorded in the
judgment that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have fairly admitted that
they do not have any objection if the Appellant / Original Defendant uses the
word VIMAL without pilfering the prominent features like colour scheme, get-up
and arrangement of the registered label of the Plaintiff. It is further
recorded in the finding that both the trade names are deceptively similar and
therefore, plaintiffs are having prima facie case. Therefore, apparently the
finding recorded by the learned trial court is ex-facie contradictorily,
against the pleadings as well as against the evidence on record.
34\. It is therefore submitted that the learned Trial Court has failed to
appreciate that there is infringement of copyright as alleged by the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs. That the learned Trial Court ought to have
appreciated that by virtue of registration of copyrights, no exclusive or
special right is granted to plaintiffs, in view of provisions of Section 48 of
the Copyright Act. That the Respondents / Original Plaitniffs have  Page 27 of
124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT made
a wrong statement in the plaint that Copyright of different artistic work of
packaging is also protected under Copyright Act though it is far from truth.
35\. It is submitted that the learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate
that the artistic work claimed on the basis of extract from the Register of
Copyrights and label, which are produced at page 46 and 47 of the original
paper book, cannot be said to be the artistic work because, it is neither a
painting, nor sculpture nor a drawing nor photograph. It is merely a package,
which is produced before the Registrar of Copyrights for registration. The
package appears to have been prepared mechanically by the use of machines /
computers and therefore, it does not qualify to be said to be an artistic work
as envisaged under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act.
36\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that even if it is
considered to be an artistic work, then also that artistic work would consist
of literature, depicting of a logo of a man, goat above 'WAGH BAKRI' and tea
leaves and by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that there is an
artistic work in orange colour background as no labour or any original idea is
presented by placing orange colour. Therefore, no Copyright can be claimed on
orange colour background. Therefore, the  Page 28 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue
Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs cannot claim that there is an infringement of copyright by
reproducing orange colour, which is the main grievance of Respondents.
37\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that the learned trial
court ought to have appreciated that the artistic work of the Appellant's /
Defendant's label are entirely different. It is submitted that the artistic
work of the Appellant's label consist of a cup and saucer with entirely
different design, background consisting of landscape of tea estates, leaves
are also in more quantity and the application of such device in work is also
vastly different from that of Respondents / Original Plaintiffs. Even the
background of the Appellant's artistic work consists of dark orange colour
while the background of the Respondent's label consists of light orange
(saffron colour). The cup and saucer design are also entirely different.
38\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that the learned trial
court ought to have appreciated that the size of oblong shape is entirely
different and colours in the said oblong shape are also different and that the
learned trial court ought to have appreciated that generic, descriptive and
common words cannot be protected unless and until it has acquired secondary
meaning. That the learned trial court has failed to  Page 29 of 124 Downloaded
on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT appreciate that
there is no infringement of trademark pertaining to registration of 'WAGH
BAKRI' as alleged by the plaintiffs. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has
further submitted that there is no registration of trademark in category of
"colour".
39\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has further submitted that it is an
admitted fact looking to the record that none of the registration is for
colour orange background or for colour scheme and that those registration
certificates produced with the paper-book cannot be relied upon since the user
claim in those registration is from 1.1.1925 while the Copyright extract the
year of first publication in the year 2013. It is therefore submitted that the
learned trial court ought to have appreciated that the Appellant has not
committed any act of passing off. That the learned trial court ought to have
appreciated that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have not shown that the
sales turnover is with regard to orange label or with regards to colour
combination, get up, cup and tea saucer. The turnover, good-will and
reputationf is due to its trade name 'WAGH BAKARI' and not due to colour
combination and that the brand names of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs
and the Appellants are totally different and on such facts the Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove any reputation and goodwill
on orange colour as sought to be canvassed by them.

JUDGMENT
40\. In support of his submission, learned Advocate for the Appellant has
referred to and relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in case of
Kumer Khaini Private Limited v. Prabhulal, reported in 2000 Law Suits (CAL),
372 and submitted that the mark, name and get- up must always be considered as
whole thing. The Calcutta High Court has considered the ratio laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of S.M.Dychem Ltd. v. M/s Cadbury (India) Ltd.
reported in (2005) 5 SCC 573 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as
under:
> "As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the
> following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, LJ has said in
> Payton & Co. vs. Snelling Lampard & Co. (1900) 17 RPC 48 that it is a
> misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant
> customer. The kind of customer that the Courts ought to think of in these
> cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the
> plaintiff's goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from
> other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If
> he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be

> not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without
> sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly
> indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived."
41\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has submitted that in the facts and
circumstances of the case, it is crystal clear that trade name of both the
parties are different and only because colour combination is more or  Page 31
of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
less same, it cannot be said that the defendant has committed any act of
passing off and therefore the order granting the injunction by the learned
trial court is required to be set aside in the interest of justice. That the
learned trial court has failed to appreciate the ratio laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.M. Dye Chem Limited (supra).
42\. Learned Advocate for the Appellant has further submitted that the learned
trial court has erred in observing that new entrant like defendant enters the
Tea business cannot use the colour combination as that of Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs in so far as the tea business is concerned and that there
is no legal force to arrive at such a conclusion more particularly when it is
an admitted fact that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs are not having any
registration of trademark for orange colour and orange colour is a generic
colour and more particularly when the said colour is used by several other tea
vendors. It is therefore submitted that the observations made by the learned
trial court are not tenable in law and on facts.
43\. That the learned trial court has gravely erred in holding that the entire
get up and colour scheme of the package adopted by the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs and the Appellant / Original Defendants are identical in every
detail and are likely to confuse and deceive the  Page 32 of 124 Downloaded on
: Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT customer easily. It is
submitted that such a finding is recorded without appreciating various
provisions of Trademarks Act and Copyright Act as well as settled common laws
of passing off action as, except the colour of the packet, there is no
similarity in the overall design or get up of the package.
44\. Learned Advocate for the Applicant has, therefore, submitted that the
impugned order passed by the learned trial court dated 11.12.2020 below Exh.7
is unjust, illegal, against the evidence on record and against the provisions
of Trademarks Act and Copyright Act and against the settled preposition of law
and therefore, requires to be quashed and set aside and the Application at
Exh.7 moved by the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs deserves to be dismissed.
45\. Learned Counsel Mr. Mehul Sharead Shah has vehemently further argued that
in the present case, the case is related to the trademark & copyright
regarding 'WAGH BAKRI' and 'VIMAL TEA'. The learned trial court has committed
serious mistakes and errors by not discussing the prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss and therefore the said order deserve to be
dismissed.
46\. It is further contended that pursuant to the copy of order at page 91
Page 33 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT (internal page 152), the learned trial court has discussed the facts
about Order 7 Rule 11 i.e. with regard to the rejection of plaint but the case
is of Exhibit-5 (interim injunction) where is the question is rejection of the
plaint. Further, there is vast difference between 'WAGH BAKRI' and 'VIMAL TEA'
as both re different. Therefore, this case requires remand and the learned
trial court is required to decide afresh. Merely colour of wrapper is same
which is the source of natural colour. Further, not a single word with regard
to findings and there is total non-application of mind and the same is non-
reasoned judgment and therefore in absence of prima facie evidence of
plaintiff, this Appeal from Order deserve to be allowed and accordingly stands
allowed. The learned trial court to decide fresh Exh.5 on merits.
47\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant / Original
Defendant has further vehemently argued that in the present case, as per the
allegations, original Defendant has copied the trademark and copyright of the
plaintiff. In fact the product of the plaintiff is of Saffron Colour whereas
the product of the defendant is of dark orange colour. In fact the colour
scheme and the names are altogether different. Further, learned Advocate Mr.
Shah has drawn the attention of this Court at page numbers 27 and 82 of the
memo of petition and submitted that he had applied for the trade mark. He has
also argued that in fact it is originally applied by the plaintiff on 1st of
January 1925 but in that form  Page 34 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT at page number 142 is very relevant
and important since the trademark has a Colum "Device". On the contrary there
were six options and out of that six options the plaintiff has neither used
the device as colour, shape of goods and sound etc. On the contrary the word
Colum 'Device' is used and therefore the case of the plaintiff is not tenable.
Further, the colour orange is generic. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has further
emphasized on the word 'device' and drawn the attention of this court on
column numbers 4 and 5 at page numbers 73 which are relevant where the BAGH
BAKRI TEA LEAF' is shown and further the label is of the year 2013 and the
trademark is more than 100 years but they have changed the label recently in
the year 2019.
48\. It is further contended by learned Advocate Mr. Shah by drawing the
attention of this court at page no.73 (column no.4 and 5) wherein also 'WAGH
BAKRI TEA LEAF' is the label which is just availed to the original plaintiff
in 2013. Therefore, the stand of more than 100 years using present 'Mark' is
not tenable. It is further contended that on the contrary the present stand is
taken on 30.7.2019 and the certificate to that extent is issued on 25.1.2020
for 'WAGH BAKRI' premium leaf. It is further contended that on page no. 147 of
the petition also premium leaf is referred to at page 148. The name 'WAGH
BAKRI' is a big name so far as the item of original defendant and the present
Appellant is  Page 35 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT concerned. There is nowhere tea garden, neither man
nor goat, nor 'WAGH BAKRI'. Therefore, there is no question of infringement.
However cup and saucer is generic. Further, the original plaintiff and the
present Respondent has saffron colour where the present appellant and the
original defendant has dark orange colour. Therefore, there is no similarity
and therefore there is no question of deceptive nature of the product of the
present Appellant. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also drawn the attention of
this court at page numbers 149, 150, 151, 152, 153 and 154 and submitted that
the colour orange is generic one. Further, he has drawn the attention of this
court at page number 168 and 173 and submitted taht the defendant is using
VIMAL and the same is a registered trade mark but 'WAGH BAKRI' is in red
colour. Therefore also there is no question of deceptive to the public at
large.
49\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has further contended that in the present case,
the learned trial judge has just narrated the arguments advanced by both the
sides from 1 to 100 pages of impugned order passed by learned trial corut, and
hardly nowhere it is stated the discussion of prima facie case, irreparable
loss and balance of convenience. However, he has drawn the attention of this
court that at page 36 (internal page 77) paragraph 42 and page 82, the stand
taken by the original defendant. Page 44 is with regard to the artistic work
i.e. Tiger, page 45 (internal  Page 36 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT page 84) is with regard to the
design, page 56 (internal page 92) is with regard to the goodwill of 'WAGH
BAKRI'. Further, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has emphatically argued that the
product of the original defendant / present Appellant is VIMAL and not the
'WAGH BAKRI'. On all such grounds, the reasons are perverse and therefore this
court is required to interfere and set aside the oder passed by the learned
Judge, City Civil Court in temporary injunction. Further, it is also argued
that nobody is using Kesari Cha (tea) on the basis of similar get-up, since
the present Appellant has dark orange coloured VIMAL product and also he has
drawn the attention of this court at page 150, 151 and page 160 of the
impugned order.
50\. At the cost of repetition, he has submitted that there is no prima facie
case neither balance of convenience nor irreparable loss to the plaintiff and
the same is not in detail discussed by the learned trial court. Further, the
orange colour is generic and used by all the traders. Further, it is contended
that if the temporary injunction is not granted, in that case, the original
Plaintiff / present Respondent has no loss. On the contrary, the present
appellant / original defendant has huge loss. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has
also drawn the attention of this court to the judgment in case of Picnic /
Picnic v/s Picnic / Picnic, where also Exh.5 was not granted. He has also
drawn the attention of this court to the  Page 37 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue
Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case of Cadbury. Further, it is argued that time and again
the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that some product is purchased by rich
persons only. Therefore, they are literate and normally they are literate
therefore there is no chance of any deceptiveness nor of cheating to the
public at large.
51\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has therefore prayed that in view of what is
stated herein above, Appeal from Order may be allowed, and impugned order may
be quashed and set aside considering the above- mentioned discrepancy in the
judgment as well as established principles of law.
52\. Further learned advocate Mr. Mehul S. Shah in his arguments has drawn the
attention of this Court at judgment delivered by the High Court of Delhi in
case of Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai decided on 15.02.1996
reported in 1996 Law Suit (Del) 187, Para 10 of which reads as under:
> "Para 10. The law relating to 'trade dress' is very clear. Kerly in 'Law of
> Trade Marks' (12th Ed. 1986, para 16.67) says that it is usually true in
> some degree that a trader's goods are recognised by their general
> appearance, or "get-up". Accordingly, resemblance or 'get-up' is not
> uncommonly an ingredient in passing-off, and it is possible for imitation of
> get-up alone to amount to passing-off. Such cases are rare, since few
> traders rely  Page 38 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
> C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that
> trade names and word trade marks are ordinarily present too, and the author
> says:
> and in these days, in this country, a difference in names is enough to warn
> the public that they are getting one trader's goods and not the others"
> (Sapers v. Specters ((1953) 70 RPC 173)".
Therefore, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has argued that in the present case even
if Safron & dark orange colour is common in that case too, it is not a case of
passing off.
53\. Learned advocate Mr. Shah has submitted that in the present case also
name is Vimal for the original defendant whereas name 'WAGH BAKRI' for the
original plaintiff, therefore, names are totally different, hence, no case is
required for temporary injunction for present respondent by the learned
learned trial Court. Learned advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance upon
the Para 20 of the above referred judgment, which reads as under:
> "Para 20. Thus, the above case also lays down that the trade dress or rather
> the whole thing must be seen in its entirely and not parts in isolation. It
> is not permissible, therefore to say that the square on the left side top
> had a small red and green border or there was a red band horizontally and
> defendant's carton if examined from close quarters, showed these feature.
> Viewed as a whole, one can see that the words Kellogg's, and AIMS are
> prominently displayed on each and therefore there can be no confusion, prima
> facie."
Page 39 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT
54\. In this judgment words Kellogg's and AIMS are totally different from each
other and so there is no confusion and here in this case also the words Vimal
and Waghbakari are different from each other and therefore there is no chance
of confusion.
55\. Learned advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance upon the judgment
delivered in case of Parle Products Limited vs. Bakemans Industries Limited
decided on 29.05.1998 reported in 1998(2) ARBLR583(Madras), Para 11 of which
reads as under:
> "Para 11: The learned Counsel for the applicant submitted that only one
> 'Gluco' is mentioned in the judgment which is the Gluco Biscuits
> manufactured by the applicant. Be it so, the observation that 'Gluco' is an
> ordinary word in which no one has any right has not been assailed. Further,

In the above judgment the common word is Gluco and in the present case
defendant has used orange colour which is generic and the same is not created.
56\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has emphatically and fervently submitted that
loss of the plaintiff can be ascertained if the injunction is not granted but
the loss of defendant (present petitioner) cannot be ascertained and
therefore, the present Appeal From Order is required to be allowed and the
impugned order passed by the learned trial Court may be set aside.
57\. Learned advocate Mr. Shah has lastly submitted that in no case there are
chances of confusion in the minds of customers since the words 'Vimal' and
'Waghbakari'are totally different therefore also requested to allow the
present Appeal From Order and to set aside the impugned order of the learned
Trial Court.

by copying the registered device mark and registered copyright of the
Respondent - Plaintiff and from committing an act of infringement thereof.
59\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondent / Original
Plaintiff has commenced his arguments through the authorities/ citations to
buttress his argument and submitted that out of total authorities submitted by
the petitioner, there are 4-5 authorities which are no longer good law,
therefore, these authorities / citations is not applicable in the present
case.
60\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has taken this court to the 4
registered trademarks produced at Page Nos. 23, 26, 29, and 32  Page 42 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT in
Respondent's Affidavit-in-Reply in the CA, which are equivalent to Page Nos.
62/A, 66, 68 and 70 in Paper Book ("PB") and one registered copyright,
produced at Page No. 35 therein, which is equivalent to Page No. 73 in PB
along with their enlarged images at pgs. 25, 28, 31, 34 and 36 in Respondent's
Affidavit-in-Reply in CA being equivalent to pgs. 74, 142, 143 and 145 in PB,
clearly suggest that Appellant - Defendant has copied the same in its device
mark / label, while applying for its own registration, produced at pgs. 37 and
38 in the said Affidavit-in-Reply of the Respondent (being equivalent to
pg.133 in PB).
61\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has submitted that the
Respondent - Plaintiff is in the Tea business since 1892 and has been a prior
user of aforesaid trademarks and copyright, as compared to that of Appellant -
Defendant, who is yet to enter in the Tea business and that, the Respondent -
Plaintiff has an annual turnover of about Rs.1200 cr. He has further submitted
that the Appellant - Defendant has not yet started its commercial business in
Tea, and while denying the distinctiveness involved in the registered
trademarks and copyright of the Respondent - Plaintiff, Appellant - Defendant
itself has sought to apply for registration for deceptive similar device mark,
while claiming distinctiveness in its copied version of colour scheme, get up,
placement of cup and saucer, leaves, etc. and thus, Appellant - Defendant has
made  Page 43 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021
CAV JUDGMENT substantial and material reproduction of Respondent - Plaintiff's
labels, which are registered trademarks and copyright by copying (a) Saffron
colour scheme (b) Get up and arrangement, (c) Placement of cup and saucer
along with the device of leaf, and (d) the artwork prepared in the oblong
containing the word 'WAGHBAKRI' in red colour. It is submitted that this can
very well be appreciated by comparing Respondent's - Plaintiff's label vis-à-
vis Appellant - Defendant's label, copies whereof are produced at Exh.1
(Colly.), which are otherwise at pgs. 34 and 38 in the Respondent's Affidavit-
in-Reply in CA (being equivalent to pgs.147 and 148 of the PB). He has further
submitted that no reason is coming forth as to why the Appellant - Defendant
has chosen the said label for its VIMAL product, which is, as aforesaid,
substantial and material reproduction of the label of Respondent - Plaintiff.
Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has therefore submitted that the
Respondent - Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case on merit about copying
the essential ingredients of its device mark by the Appellant - Defendant,
coupled with Respondent's established goodwill, reputation and prior use,
followed by balance of convenience and likelihood of causing irreparable
injury, being in favour of the Respondent - Plaintiff. Therefore, Respondent -
Plaintiff was rightly issued an injunction order.  Page 44 of 124 Downloaded

62\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs has further submitted that in a matter of a registered trademark as
device mark with a label along with registration of copyright thereof, what is
to be seen is the over all similarity from the point of view of a common man
with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, and one is not supposed
to place both the competing marks side by side to draw dissimilarities and to
find out whether the words and colours used therein are generic and
descriptive or not.
63\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs have placed reliance on the following judgments, which are very
much similar to the one on hand and submitted that the Courts have made such
overall comparison as discussed herein above, while granting injunction
against the usage of objectionable device mark / label. He has relied upon the
following judgments which are as under:

follow in case of infringement of trade mark or copyright and therefore,
learned Trial Court has rightly granted the injunction in question.

66\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has further submitted in his
written notes that the following judgments relied upon on behalf of Appellant
- Defendant cannot be pressed in service and hence, are not applicable to the
present case for the reasons stated against each one of them as indicated
hereunder:
> (i) S. M. Dyechem Ltd. vs. Cadbury (India) Ltd. reported in (2000) 5 SCC 573
> : (@ pg.197 in PB):
> The law laid down in this judgment has been expressly held to be bad in the

> Ltd., reported in (2001) 5 SCC 73 in para 17 to 20 (Pls. see judgment No.14
> at pgs.190 to 212 in the 1 st Compilation of the Respondent), mainly on the
> ground that two English judgments relied upon in the case of S.M. Dyechem
> Ltd.
> viz. Pianotist Co. (para.27 @ pg.216 in PB) and Payton and Co. vs. Snelling
> (para 54 @ pg.224 in PB), are not applicable to Indian conditions, and
> hence, the judgment of S.M. Dyechem Ltd.
> (supra), cannot be referred to and relied upon.
> (ii) Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai reported in 1996 Law Suit
> (Del) 187;
The said judgment has also been found not to be laying down a  Page 48 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT good law
in later judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of N. Rangarao & Sons
Vs. Anil Garg, reported in 2005 SCC Online Del 1293 (rel. para 67), since
reliance was placed on the very two English judgments referred to above as
well as on the judgment of S.M. Dyechem Ltd. (supra).
(iii) Kuber Khaini Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Prabhoolal Ramratan Das Pvt. Ltd. reported in
2000 Law Suit (Cal) 372 ;
The law laid down by the said judgment is not a good law, inasmuch as, it has
also relied upon the above very two English judgments in case of Payton and Co
Limited vs. Snelling (para 17 @ pg.264), which has been declared bad by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 20 of Cadila Health Care Ltd., reported in
(2001) 5 SCC 73.
(iv) K. Narayanan vs. S. Murli reported in 2008 Law Suit (Cal) 372;
This judgment does not apply to the present case, since injunction was denied
in the said case mainly on two grounds viz. (i) the plaintiff's mark was not
registered and his application for registration was pending, on the basis
whereof, it had filed a Suit for passing of for injuncting the other side (Pls
see para 3 & 26), and (ii) plaintiff had suppressed certain important facts.
However,  Page 49 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT in the instant case, Respondent - Plaintiff has
registered trademarks and copy rights, whereby, it has acquired a statutory
recognition to use the same to the exclusion of rest of the world.
(v) Parle Products Ltd. vs. Bakeman Industries Ltd.
reported in MANU / TN / 1824 / 1998 ;
This is also not a good law in view of the Apex Court's judgment in case of
Parle Products (P) Ltd. vs. J. P. & Co., Mysore.
(vi) Britannia Industries Ltd Vs ITC Limited reported in MANU / DE / 0626 /
2017;
This judgment is for passing off action of Britannia and not for infringement
of trade mark or copyright, as it is there in the present case. Secondly, in
this case, Britannia was there in the business of biscuits since many years,
whereas in the present case, the Appellant- Defendant is yet to enter in tea
business. Hence, the said judgment cannot be applied to the present case.
(vii) Cipla Limited Vs M.K Pharmaceuticals reported in MANU / DE / 1938 /
2007;
This judgment is not applicable to the facts of the present case, as this
judgment is related to prescribed medicines / tablets with a particular colour
and shape with blister form of packagings, wherein the get up, colour scheme,
arrangement of label are not  Page 50 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT relevant, whereas, in the present
case, the same are essential features of label. It was under these
circumstances that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court observed that there can be no
monopoly over colour and shape.
(viii) Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd. v. Patel reported in 2003 SCC On Line (Del)
1005:
This judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court is also entirely on different facts,
since, in this case, the issue was related to monopoly of colour 'red' and
'white' and not on the entire get-up, colour scheme arrangement and placement
on label. Whereas, in the instant matter, the case involved does not relate to
claiming monopoly over 'orange' colour, but having registered trademarks
involving a label / device mark and registered copyright on the entire lay-
out, getup, arrangement, colour scheme and placement on leaves and other
things. Even in the aforesaid case, in para-52 of the judgment, the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court had ultimately held that owing to the following reasons,
there was sufficient resemblance between Colgate Palmolive's carton of goods
comprising of registered trademark and that of the Ajanta of the Defendant in
that case, resulting in substantial and material reproduction of trade mark of
Colgate by the Defendant.  Page 51 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41
IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
(a) Defendant's adoption of a red coloured background on the front panel of
carton is similar to that of Colgate.
(b) Adoption of white colour for inscribing the brand name "AJANTA" is similar
to the brand name "COLGATE" which is also inscribed in white colour.
(c) Similar size and placement of the aforesaid two brand names on the front
panel of the carton of both the parties.
(d) Nature of goods being similar i.e. toothpaste, whose intending purchaser
may not be literate to bestow much attention on a daily use product like
toothpaste.
Ultimately, during the course of arguments, Hon'ble Delhi High Court suggested
to the Defendant to alter the colour scheme and other changes in the copied
version of packaging to which, Defendant was agreeable and accordingly the
matter was put to rest.

JUDGMENT This judgment is for passing off action and not for infringement of
trade mark or copyright and also not involving a device mark / label with a
particular get-up colour scheme, arrangement of label, etc. as it is there in
the present case.
67\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has therefore submitted that
the injunction cannot be refused solely on the basis of the contention raised
by the Appellant - Defendant that others are copying the registered trademarks
and copyright of the Respondent - Plaintiff. In support of his submission he
has referred to para-22 @ pg.382 of the Judgment at Sr. No.22 in the 1st
Compilation of the Judgments, in case of Rangoli Chemfoods Pvt. Ltd.)
68\. It is further submitted by learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi
that it is well established that the Appellate Court would normally not be
justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under Appeal, solely
on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage, it
would have come to contrary conclusion. If the discussion had been exercised
by the learned Trial Court reasonably and in a judicial manner, the fact that
the Appellate Court would have taken a different view, may not justify
interference with the Trial Court's exercise of discretion. In support of his
aforesaid submission, learned Senior  Page 53 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar

attention of this Court at Annexure - I (Colly.) Page 23, TM Application No.

Page 29 TM Application No. 4250077 dated 30.07.2019 and enlarged Logo on Page

Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi to buttress his arguments has placed
reliance on the Judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Parle Products (P) Ltd Vs. J. P. And Co., Mysore, reported in (1972) 1 SCC
618, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the question of similarity of
one product to another market product or not,  Page 54 of 124 Downloaded on :
Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT therefore, instead of
dissimilarity, first the Court is required to see similarity in the products,
therefore, in the present case, if we compare the product of the plaintiff and
the defendant, there is some similarity, therefore, learned trial Court has
rightly exercised the discretion in favour of the respondents who are original
plaintiffs. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has further argued that
in the present case the learned trial court has rightly observed that action
of the plaintiff is at the doctrine of quia timet action since the defendant
has started business though the application was proposed to be used.
Therefore, if the manufacturing get started, the plaintiff would have
irreparable loss and therefore the original plaintiff has rightly taken quia
timet action against the original defendant.
70\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment in Case of Dabur India Limited Vs. Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan
Pvt. Ltd, decided on 02.07.2012, reported in 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3332, Para

71\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment in Case of Marico Limited vs. Pratik Goyal & Anr. Decided on
26.09.2014 reported in 2014 SCC Online Del 1786, Para Nos. 25 and 26 which
read as under:

Therefore, it is argued by learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the
Respondents has submitted that in the present case too, facts of that case
squarely applies too.
72\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has drawn the attention that
if the trade mark of the plaintiff PARACHUTE/PARACHUTE LITE is compared as a
whole with the trade mark of the defendants, PARALITE adopted by the
defendants is deceptively similar mark as that of the plaintiff as it appears
that the first part PARA is taken by the defendants from the registered trade
mark PARACHUE and the remaining portion of the mark LITE is taken by
defendants from another registered trade mark PARACHUTE LITE where the mark
LITE is a part of registration No. 888245. Thus, the argument of the
defendants are without any force.
73\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment delivered in case of Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable Pvt.  Page 57 of

Vs. Sri Vinayaka Milk Products decided on 15.07.2015, reported in 2015 SCC
OnLine Del 10637 "Para 22. The plaintiff sells its products all over the
country, including in Hyderabad where the defendant is carrying out its
illegal activities. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the possibility of
confusion being caused by the defendant's adoption of the impugned mark which
is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's MOTHER DAIRY (blue logo) and the
trade-dress used for its packaging is very high and in fact inevitable due to
the following reasons:
a. The defendant is selling identical products under a deceptively similar
trademark and packaging.
b. The plaintiff's and the defendant's products are sold through the same
trade channels. c. Since milk is a necessary commodity, the classes of
consumers purchasing the said products would include a large segment of the
illiterate and semi-illiterate population. The defendant by its adoption and
use of the impugned mark and the packaging/trade dress is clearly attempting
to pass off its goods as those of the plaintiff. This is in clear violation of
the plaintiff's common law as well as statutory rights in the MOTHER DAIRY
(blue logo) trademark and the trade dress used for its milk products. The sale
and distribution of the impugned products has resulted in great harm prejudice
to the plaintiff's business, rights and interests apart from amounting to
tarnishment and dilution of  Page 58 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02

goodwill. The plaintiff is suffering huge losses and damages due to the
blatant and outright violation of its rights by the defendant."
74\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment delivered by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in case of Parle
Agro Private Limited Vs. Parle Agro Private Limited decided on 28 March 2018.
75\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment of this Court in case of Gujarat Tea Depot Company & 1 Vs. Bhagaram
Krupaji Ganchi in Appeal from Order No. 116 of 2015 decided on 04.08.2015, of
which para 8 reads as under:

76\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment of Delhi High Court in case of N. Ranga Rao & Sons Vs. Anil Garg &
Ors., decided on 02.12.2005 reported in 2005 SCC Online Del 1293. Of which
Para Nos. 66, 67 and 68 which read as under:

There has been reference made to Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) to come to the
conclusion that if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not
treat the label fairly, then he is not the  Page 60 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue
Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT person who would form the
basis of the test. There is force in the contention of learned counsel for the
plaintiff that the dictum in Kellogg Company's case (supra) to the extent it
relied upon Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) would not hold good in view of the
subsequent development of law in M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd.'s case (supra) and the
review thereof in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra), the Apex Court while
relying upon the observations in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) observed that if
the customer does not distinguish the characteristics of the two packings,
then he is not a customer whose view can properly be regarded by the Court.
However in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra), this very aspect was
specifically considered. The Apex Court took note of the earlier judgments in
this behalf and came to the conclusion that the decisions of the Apex Court in
the last four decades preceding clearly laid down that what had to be seen in
the case of a passing off action between the competing marks and the
likelihood of deception or confusion. The Apex Court found that the principle
of phonetic similarity cannot be jettisoned and in determining the test vis-a-
vis the person who has to be kept in mind as a customer, the views expressed
in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) were found to be contrary to the decision of
the Apex Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Gupta, .
Para 68. In Amritdhara Pharmacy's case (supra), the product was examined from
the prospect of it being purchased by villagers and townfolk, literate as well
as illiterate and, thus, the question has to be approached from the point of
view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may
be related to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons and
the  Page 61 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021
CAV JUDGMENT purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in
England."
Therefore, learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has emphatically and fervently
submitted to buttress his arguments that the judgment produced by the
petitioner (Original-defendant) in case of Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar
Bhadabhai would not held good law in view of the subsequent development of
law, therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly exercised discretion in
favour of the original plaintiff (present respondent).
77\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment in case of Cadila Health Care Ltd Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd,
reported in (2001) 5 SCC 73, of which Para Nos. 17, 18 and 20 which read as
under:
> "Para 17: Our attention was drawn to a recent judgment of this Court in S.M.
> Dyechem Ltd. Vs. Cadbury (India) Ltd. (2000) 5 SCC 573 where in a passing

Para 18: We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observations in Dyechems
case (supra). As far as this Court is concerned, the decisions in the last
four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the case of a
passing off action is the similarity between the competing marks and to
determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing confusion. This
is evident from the decisions of this Court in the cases of National Sewing
Thread Co. Ltd.s case (supra), Corn products refining Companys case (supra),
Amritdhara Pharmacys case (supra), Durga Dutt Sharmas case (supra), Hoffmann-
La Roche & Co. Ltd.s case (supra). Having come to the conclusion, in our
opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential features is relevant,
this Court in Dyechems case (supra) sought to examine the difference in the
two marks Piknic and Picnic. It applied three tests, they being 1) is there
any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied ? 2) mode in
which the parts are put together differently i.e. whether dissimilarity of the
part or parts is enough to make the whole thing dissimilar and 3) whether when
there are common elements, should one not pay more regard to the parts which
are not common, while at the same time not disregarding the common parts? In
examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the
conclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were written and the
peculiarity of the script and concluded that the above three dissimilarities
have to be given  Page 63 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT more importance than the phonetic similarity or the
similarity in the use of the word PICNIC for PIKNIK.
Para 20: Lastly, in Dyechem's case (supra), it was observed in para 54 as
under:
As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing-off action, the following
principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, L.J. has said in Payton & Co.
Vs. Snelling, Lampard & Co. (1900) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to
refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer that the
courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the
distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiffs goods, those characteristics
which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates
to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer
whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in
N.S. Thread & Co. Vs. Chadwick & Bros. AIR 1948 Mad 481 which was a passing-
off action.) In Schweppes Case (1905) 22 RPC 601 (HL) Lord Halsbury said, if a
person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label
fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without
reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you
cannot say he is deceived. These observations appear to us to be contrary to
the decision of this Court in Amritdharas case (supra) where it was observed
that the products will be purchased by both villagers and townfolk, literate
as well as illiterate and the question has to be approached from the point of
view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may
relate to goods largely sold to  Page 64 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT illiterate or badly educated
persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in
England. While we agree that in trade mark matters, it is necessary to go into
the question of comparable strength, the decision on merits in Dyechems case
(supra) does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold
accordingly."
Therefore, learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has submitted that, what
is held in case of Dyechem Ltd. case (supra) is no longer a good law.
78\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment in case of Wander Ltd and Another Vs. Antox India P. Ltd, reported in
1990 (Supp) SCC 727 of which Para No. 14 which reads as under:
> "Para 14: The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of
> discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the Appellate Court will
> not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance

79\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Trivedi has also placed reliance on the
judgment in case of Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd Vs. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel
reported in (2006) 8 SCC 726 of which Para Nos. 9 & 10 which read as under:
> Para 9: On the premise that the respondents had been infringing its rights,

80\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi, further emphasized on the
aspect that the Madras High Court had not considered the dictum of Hon'ble
Supreme Court, therefore, also the reliance placed by the learned advocate for
the petitioner is not applicable to the present case.
81\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi, further argued that as per
the catena of decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the product is not required
to be seen side-by-side but how the average person tests, note of the product
is important.
82\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also taken this Court to
Para-62 of the impugned order that the plaintiff being prior user, therefore,
defendant's stand is not tenable. On all such grounds, learned  Page 68 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT Senior
Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has emphasized that the learned trial Court has
rightly observed the prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable
loss in favour of the Respondent / Original Respondent, therefore, there is no
need to interfere with the order of learned trial Court. Further, learned
Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has requested this Court that everybody has
an art of writing of judgment, somebody writes prima facie case few time,
therefore, writing of judgment differs from judges to judges, therefore, he
forcefully argued, merely not having discussion on I.O. case would not set
aside the impugned order in toto whereas somebody writes prima facie case,
therefore, writing of judgment differs from judges to judges.
83\. Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Kamal Trivedi has further argued that though
everybody has right to chose the colour but if there is some similarity, in
that case nobody would like to be deceived. Further, learned Senior Advocate
Mr. Kamal Trivedi has taken this court to the decision in case of Parle
Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co. Mysore reported in (1972) 1 SCC 618 where
identical matter is discussed that one should not compare only label but one
should compare the colour scheme and another arts, whereas in the present
case, colour is saffron and the same is contended why no other colour is used
by the so called Appellant / Original Defendant. One should not go in generic,
everybody  Page 69 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT has a right to use colour but when there is a
registered trade mark and registered copy right, in that case one should be
prevented from using the same. Further, the present Respondent / Original
Plaintiff has business of Rs.12 Crores per year, and therefore, when the
Appellant / Original Defendant has yet to enter in the market, and therefore,
the Respondent / Original Plaintiff has rightly instituted the quia timet
action. If the manufacture is started in that case, there will be huge
irreparable loss to the Respondent / Original Plaintiff. Learned Senior
Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has referred to all the authorities which were
discussed earlier in nutshell and emphasized that the in the case of Mother
Dairy Fruit & Vegetable Pvt. Ltd. v. Sri Vinayaka Milk products reported in
(2015) SCC On Line Del 10637, where the Vinayaka Milk was having identical
colour and design and therefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court has restrained the
Defendants though the names were to be on the colours and other scheme like
blue colour is generic name but here in the present case the orange colour is
generic name, still however, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has passed the order in
favour of the Plaintiff and the Defendant was restrained for the same. Learned
Senior Advocate Mr. Kamal Trivedi has also vehemently argued that one should
see through the average intelligence of the person how the common man takes
the product instead of relying only on intellectual person only and also drawn
attention of this Court in case Marico Limited v. Pratik Goyal reported  Page
70 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT in 2014 SCC On Line Del 1786. Lastly, learned Senior Advocate Shri
Kamal Trivedi has taken this Court to five judgments which were heavily placed
reliance by the learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant /
Original Defendant that how the said judgments are not relevant to the present
case.
84\. Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Kamal Trivedi has drawn the attention of this
Court to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of S.M.Dychem Ltd.
v. M/s Cadbury (India) Ltd. reported in (2005) 5 SCC 573 and submitted that
the learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant has heavily placed
reliance on this English Judgments. But in the case of Cadila Health Care Ltd
Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd (supra) on page no. 206 of the Compilation. The
S.M.Dychem Ltd. Case (supra) was not the correct law and therefore the
reliance placed by the learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original Defendant
cannot be applicable to the facts of the present case.
85\. Further, it is also discussed in the Cadila Health Care Ltd Vs. Cadila
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (supra) that the English Judgment cannot be based to the
situation in India and also argued that merely application for availing the
trade mark does not create any right. It is also contended  Page 71 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT that the
Respondent / Original Plaintiff has a registered trade mark and copy right and
therefore Appellant / Original Defendant has no right to use the trade mark of
the Respondent / Original Plaintiff.
86\. Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Kamal Trivedi has also drawn the attention of
this Court in the case of Kellogg Company vs Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai reported
in 1996 PTC (16) 187 wherein learned Senior Advocate has drawn the attention
at paragraph 16 where the judgment in case of Payton & Co. v. Snelling,
Lampard & Company is discussed, which is English judgment, which is also
discussed in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra) and it is observed in
Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s that this English judgment cannot be relied.
87\. Further, it is pointed by the learned Senior Counsel Shri Kamal Trivedi
that Gluco is generic word like in the present case the orange is generic name
but the latest law is considered in the submission of the aggrieved party on
generic name. Ultimately, learned Senior Advocate has argued on the basis of
the judgment in case of Parle Products (P) Ltd Vs. J. P. And Co., Mysore
(supra) that the courts should compare similarity side by side and how the
ordinary person will look the drug and ultimately impliedly over-ruled the
Madras High Court Judgment.  Page 72 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT (H) Joint Legal Aspects by Learned
Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant:
88\. Further, learned Advocate Ms. Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant /
Original / Original Defendant has vehemently and fervently argued that
pursuant to the cations, the reliance is placed by him in case of Britannia
Industries Ltd. v. ITC Limited reported in 2017 (70) PTC 66 wherein only the
High Court of Delhi was having identical issue and held that essential
attributes which need to be established for a successful passing off action
have often been considered as the classical trinity, which, in the words of
Lord Oliver in Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden, 1990 RPC 341 HL are
discussed. In that case injunction was sought for restraining Britannia from,
inter alia, passing off ITC's alleged rights in the trade dress / packaging /
label and dilution of the market etc. Reliance is placed upon paragraph 19
that it is also pointed out in Kerly that a trader, who introduces a new
feature into the get-up of his goods, does not thereby acquire any proprietary
interest in it so as to be able to prevent its use by competitors, until it
has become so identified with his goods that its use by others is calculated
to deceive. The question that needs to be examined is whether the combination
of yellow and blue in the packaging of ITC's biscuits had become so identified
with ITC's biscuits that its use by others, such as Britannia, would be
regarded as  Page 73 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT being calculated to deceive? We do not think that in
the short span of time and, particularly when Britannia has alleged that the
first invoice of ITC is of May 2016, the yellow-blue combination in the
packaging of ITC's biscuits had become so identified with ITC so as to enable
ITC to prevent its use by competitors. Ultimately, learned Advocate Mr. Mehul
Sharad Shah for the Appellant has heavily placed reliance on the aspect that
it is not easy for a person to claim exclusivity over a colour combination
particularly when the same has been in use only for a short while. It is only
when it is established, may be even prima facie, that the colour combination
has become distinctive of a person's product that an order may be made in his
favour. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has vehemently argued that in
the present case also, the Respondent / Original Plaintiff has claimed orange
colour as exclusive right which is not proper and therefore learned trial
court has committed an error both in law as well as in appreciating the facts
and exercised the discretion which is perverse and therefore this court is
require to interfere to set aside the same.
89\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has placed reliance upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Cipla Limited v.
M.K.Pharmaceuticals reported in 2007 Law Suit (Del) 526 = 2008 (36) PTC 166
wherein it is held in paragraph 5 that even if there has been  Page 74 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
deliberate copying of similar solour and shape of the plaintiff's tablets that
would not amount to passing off, since colour and shape are not indicative of
the drugs neither they are associated with the trade mark. There may be
several other tablets of the similar shape and colour available in the market.
His Lordship was supported in his above view by Rizla Limited v. Bryant and
May Limited reported in 1986 RPC 389.
90\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has argued that the Appellant /
Original Defendant is selling premium tea and therefore the purchaser is
either middle class or higher middle class and therefore there is no chance
for deceptiveness. Further, it was held in that case that there should not be
any monopoly over the colours and therefore the learned trial court has not
rightly decided the temporary injunction in favour of the Respondent /
Original Plaintiff. Further, it is also vehemently submitted by learned
Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah that normally lower class people would not for
for premium tea and therefore also the learned trial court has committed
mistake in exercising the discretion in favour of the Respondent / Original
Plaintiff.
91\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has also placed reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd. v.
Patel and Anr. reported in 2005 Law Suit (Del) 1540 =  Page 75 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT 2005
(31) PTC 583 wherein learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has placed
reliance on paragraph 25 and submitted that in that case even if the
plaintiff's case that the word 'COLGATE' and the red and white colour scheme,
both constitute essential features, then at best the defendants could have
been held to have adopted only one of the essential features i.e. 'red and
white' colour scheme and not essential features in plural as required by the
above judgment. Secondly, in the earlier portion of the paragraph relied upon
by the plaintiffs therein, it has been held that even in an action for
infringement the plaintiff must make out that the use of the defendant's mark
is likely to deceive unless the similarity between the two marks is visually
or phonetically so close that the Court reaches a conclusion that there is an
imitation. Further it is held that in view of the court, the defendant's mark
'AJANTA' is visually and phonetically not so close as to indicate a blatant
imitation, straightaway leading to an inference of infringement
notwithstanding the red and white colour combination. Learned Advocate Mr.
Mehul Sharad Shah has also placed reliance upon paragraph 29 and 51 of that
judgment and submitted that if one takes a look at the carton of the
plaintiffs comprising of registered trademark 190279, it shows that the word
'COLGATE' in white on a red background i.e. the 'red and white' combination
still remains the predominant feature of the plaintiff's mark even in the
altered marks and the addition of a swirl of pincer device in blue or a splash
of yellow  Page 76 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT colour do not alter this predominant giving the
plaintiff's mark a distinctive identity entitled to protection from passing
off.
92\. During the course of arguments, while learned Advocate Mr. Shah was
reading the judgment in the case of Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd. v. Patel and
Anr. (supra), learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondent /
Original Plaintiff has requested this court to refer to paragraph 52 of the
judgment which reads thus:
> "52\. After taking into account the similarities in the defendant's product
> which has been registered by comparing it with the plaintiff's registered
> mark, I am of the view that in respect of the competing two products, there
> is sufficient resemblance between the plaintiff's and the defendant's
> product to justify the plea of passing off. This is illustrated by the
> following similarities:
> (i) The adoption of a red coloured background by the defendant to the
> similar extent as that of the plaintiff on the front panel of the carton.
> (ii) The adoption of white colour for inscribing the brand name AJANTA is
> similar to the brand name 'COLGATE' which is also inscribed in white colour.
> (iii) Similarity in the size of the two brand names 'COLGATE' and  Page 77
> of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
> 'AJANTA'.
> (iv) Similar placement of the two brand names 'AJANTA' and 'COLGATE' on the
> front panel of the carton.
> (v) The plaintiff being the established market leader had already
> established a market reputation in respect of its red and white product
> marked 'COLGATE'.
> (vi) The nature of goods in respect of which the two marks 'COLGATE' and
> 'AJANTA' are used as trademark are the same i.e. toothpaste.
> (vii) Toothpaste is a fast turnover item and an intending purchaser who may
> or may not be literate is not likely to bestow much attention on a daily use
> product such as a toothpaste."
93\. Further, learned Senior Counsel Shri Kamal Trivedi has placed reliance
upon paragraph 55 and 57 of the judgment which reads thus:
> "55\. However, during the course of the arguments, suggestions were invited
> from the parties and the parties have given their suggestions for alternate
> packaging. In my view the suggested carton of the defendants which is marked
> as 'XX' would not amount to passing off of the plaintiff's product as per
> the principles laid down in the above noted judgments. The only change made
> to  Page 78 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021
> CAV JUDGMENT 'XX' given as sample by the defendant is that it will be
> required to print AJANTA in Hindi also in golden colour.
> 57\. Consequently, the defendants are hereby directed to inscribe the above
> mark 'AJANTA HEALTH' shown in Hindi along with the two swirls on left and
> right of the said mark in Golden Colour in the instead of the colour white
> as shown in Carton 'XX'."
94\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has further argued that one should not claim
exclusivity of orange colour and also draw the attention of this court to the
order passed by the learned trial court and submitted that the learned trial
court has mainly passed temporary injunction on passing off whereas there is
no discussion of prima facie case for infringement of trademark nor any
copyright.
95\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has further drawn the attention of this court
in case of Amrit Banaspati Company Limited v. Suraj Industries Limited
reported in 1994 Law Suit (HP) 68 = AIR 1996 HP 70 and placed reliance upon
paragraph 41 which are reproduced herewith as under:
> "41\. On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, first of all the plaintiffs
> have not been able to prove prima facie case in their favour for an action
> based on passing-off goods as the goods of another. In case the injunction,
> prayed for, is granted it will be the  Page 79 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue

> case in favour of the plaintiffs, the defendants are likely to suffer loss
> in their income which they are deriving from the sale of those pouches of
> ANGAN ghee. Balance of convenience in such circumstances would not be in
> favour of the plaintiffs at all."
96\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah at the cost of repetition has submitted that
the Appellant / Original Defendant has submitted that the Respondent /
Original Plaintiff started the present trademark in the year 2020 though since
the year 1925 always the same logo was not available which is in the year 2020
like Man, Goat, Cup and Saucer etc. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also
submitted that 19 other persons (other traders) are using the same logo.
Therefore, there cannot be any monopoly over the orange colour for the
trademark or for the copyright. Further, the trade test is totally different.
97\. Per contra, learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondent
/ Original Plaintiff has submitted that the Respondent / Original Plaintiff
has registered trademark and copyright, therefore he should be protected.
Further, he has submitted that one should not see side by side trade product
as a whole which includes the colour, shape, design and everything. Further,
one cannot distinguish that in the case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), it
was only for the drugs and therefore  Page 80 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar
02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT the two judgments which were not
good law as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is to be seen but one cannot
distinguish the internal discussion about the English law which is of no use
for Indian Law so far as the similarity and dissimilarity is concerned and
therefore, the learned trial court has rightly exercised the discretion on the
basis of registration of trademark. Further the Appellant / Original Defendant
in the present case has huge products and when they get an idea of starting
the tea business, in that case they should think about everything including
similarity and dissimilarity of the product which is used by the present
Respondent / Original Plaintiff and which is in prior use as well as the
registered trademark which has more value than any other product especially
the present Appellant / Original Defendant, which has yet to start the
business [proposed product / proposed trade name] and therefore the Respondent
/ original Plaintiff has rightly instituted the suit coupled with interim
injunction for having quia timet action against the Appellant / Original
Defendant who has lost the defence for temporary injunction and ultimately the
learned trial court has rightly decided the temporary injunction in favour of
the Respondent / Original Plaintiff and there is no requirement of
interference by this court and has prayed to dismiss the present Appeal from
Order.

JUDGMENT
98\. Further, learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has fairly submitted
that he is ready to conduct full fledged trial within six months or three
months or within two months on merits but has requested that his business
which is a registered trademark may not be disturbed in the eyes of law,
during the pendency of the Suit.
(I) Points Framed For Conclusion:
99\. On the basis of the arguments advanced by both the sides and on the basis
of the settled principles of law, the following two points have been framed
for conclusion of this Appeal from Order:
> (i) Whether the Appellant / Original Defendant proves that the powers
> exercised by the learned City Civil Court No.29, Ahmedabad below Exh.7 for
> interim injunction in Civil Suit No. 884/2020 is arbitrary, perverse,
> capricious, illegal and against the principles of law?
                 (ii)    What Order?
          100.   My Reply to the above points is as under:
                         (i)     In negative.
                         (ii)    As per final order.
    (J)    REASONS:
> 101\. Having heard the arguments advanced by both the sides and also on the
> basis of the authorities / citations referred to by both the sides,  Page 82

Scope of Appeal:

JUDGMENT
103\. The Respondent No.1 - Gujarat Tea Depot Company and Respondent No.2 -
Gujarat Tea processors & Packers Private Limited (Original Plaintiffs) have
filed Civil Suit No. 884 of 2020 in the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad against
the Appellant / Original Defendant - Vimal Dairy Limited for permanent
injunction restraining the Appellant / Original Defendant and its agents from
manufacturing, marketing, advertising for sales, the Appellant's / Original
Defendant's products under the Trade Mark / Label "VIMAL" "TM Application No.
4352164 including its Art Work, Colour Scheme, Get-up, Arrangement and / or
any other Label, which is substantial and material reproduction of the label
of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs from committing an act of
infringement of Respondent's / Original Plaintiff's Trademarks / Labels. The
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have further prayed in the Suit for
directions to the Appellant / Original Defendant to give true and correct
accounts of the goods manufactured and marketed by them under the Trademark /
Label "VIMAL" and after verifying the accounts and deriving at the amount of
the profit earned by the Appellant / Original Defendant, to pay the said
amount with 18% interest coupled with and application for temporary injunction
along with the Suit under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code with similar
reliefs prayed in the Suit.  Page 84 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
104\. The learned Trial court after hearing both the sides allowed the
temporary injunction under Order 39 Rule 1(a) of the Code against which the
Appellant / Original Defendant has approached this Court.
105\. The prime grounds of the Appeal is based on the Trial Court order being
ex facie illegal, against the provisions of Trademark and Copyright and
against the evidence on record, and therefore, requires to be quashed. It is
an undisputed fact that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs are using "WAGH
BAKRI" since the year 1925, but simultaneously, the court is in agreement that
the present "WAGH BAKRI PREMIUM TEA" is started before two years i.e. in the
year 2019. Therefore, the main grievance of the present Appellant / Original
Defendant is with regard to the different Trademark since the Defendants /
Original Plaintiffs have "WAGH BAKRI" whereas the Appellant / Original
Defendant has "VIMAL". Further, the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have
Saffron Colour upon their product whereas the Appellant / original Defendant
has Dark Saffron Colour upon their product and therefore there is quite
dissimilarity. Hence, there is no question of infringement of copyright nor
there is any question of passing off action by the Appellant / Original
Defendant to the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs and therefore the learned
Trial Court has passed the order which is perverse, arbitrary, illegal and
capricious.

JUDGMENT
106\. In the case of Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products
Ltd. Reported in AIR 1960 SC 142, it was held that the reputation among
general public should attach to trade mark and not to the maker of the goods.
Further, it is held that tests for determining similarity of marks - trade
connection between different goods - Trade marks 'Gluvita' used with reference
to biscuits and 'Glucovita' used with reference to glucose, held were likely
to cause deception or confusion. Therefore, the Court has to see the
similarity between the trade products.
107\. The following is the latest trade logo of both; the Appellant / Original
Defendant and the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs wherein the Appellant /
Original Defendant is having Application No. 4352164 dated 19.11.2021:
(Original Plaintiffs /Respondents) (Original Defendant /Appellant)  Page 86 of
124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
108\. As per authorities submitted by learned Senior Advocate for the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs, use of single colour of the Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs, did not qualify single colour to be trademark but in the
present case, in addition to colour, there are so many similarities such as;
Comparison of trade marks of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs and the
Appellant / Original Defendant:
(a) The tag line of both the trademarks start with "PREMIUM". The tagline for
"VIMAL" is "PREMIUM CTC LEAF TEA" while that of "WAGH BAKRI" is "PREMIUM LEAF
TEA" which is likely to confuse the public at large.
(b) The cup and plate used as a shape for the trademark are deceptively
similar with white colour and similar shape of green leaves placed on the
plate.
(c) The logo of VIMAL is placed in oval shaped circle with a reddish
background and that of a WAGH BAKRI's logo is also similar to it with a
reddish background.
(d) The background of the logo for VIMAL uses similar colour that of WAGH
BAKRI which is likely to create confusion among the public at large.
Page 87 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT
109\. If we take out both the names i.e. 'WAGH BAKRI' and 'VIMAL'; from both
the products, prima facie it appears that the Respondents' / Original
Plaintiffs' i.e. Copyright Label contains 'WAGH BAKRI' printed in White Font
inside round Brown Colour Oval Shape with White coloured Cup and Saucer full
of tea with Leaf placed on the top of the Saucer. Even the original colour of
the Respondents is orange whereas the Appellant's / Original Defendant's
colour is dark saffron. Leaf Tea is common in both cup and saucer are common
and design common. In the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs it is written
'PREMIUM LEAF TEA' whereas in the Appellant / Original Defendant it is written
'PREMIUM CTC LEAF TEA'. By comparing two products namely of the Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs and the Appellant / Original Defendant, it further prima
facie appears that the Appellant / Original Defendant has copied the
Respondents' / Original Plaintiffs' product except in TRADE- NAME.
110\. Therefore, in sum and substance, Ex-facie there are so many similarities
and therefore, there are all chances of confusion by the ordinary man of
average intelligence and also by lower class and middle class and others too,
therefore, the ex facie, there is some substances in observation made by the
learned trial Court for exercising the equitable  Page 88 of 124 Downloaded on
: Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT relief, in favour of
original plaintiff who is respondent in the present matter, resultantly, the
order of trial Court is not perverse.
111\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Shah has heavily argued that the learned
Trial Court has not answered all the defence taken by the Appellant / Original
Defendant and mainly up to 80 pages of his order, the arguments are only
narrated and thereafter holding prima facie case, balance of convenience and
in an arbitrarily manner, the temporary injunction is granted which is
perverse, capricious and illegal.
112\. It is to be noted that the learned Trial Court has at page no. 38 of the
judgment has discussed about the judgment Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case
of Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. v. J.P. And Co., Mysore reported in AIR 1972 SC
1359, relied upon by the learned Advocate for the Appellant / Original
Defendant that the product involved is Corn Flakes, which may not be used by
any illiterate customers. However, the product involved in the present case is
Tea, which is purchased even by illiterate customers such as illiterate tea
vendors. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination can the said judgment relied
by the learned Advocate for the defendant be held applicable to the facts of
the present case. On the contrary, the judgment, relied upon by the learned
Advocate for the Plaintiffs, in the considered opinion of the Court, squarely
applies to the  Page 89 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT facts of the present case. Therefore, the learned
Trial Court has rightly applied the ratio laid by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. v. J.P. And Co., Mysore (supra) wherein
it is held that when two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and
various differences, yet the main idea left on the mid by both may be the
same. A person acquainted with one mark and not having the two side by side
for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be
impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods
which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted. Marks are
remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by
any photographic recollection of the whole and therefore, it is not appearing
that the learned Trial Court has not given any reasons, though there may be
less of reasons (few reasons), but, it differs with loss of reasons (non-
reasoned order), to some extent judicial writing is not suffering from "Breve
Judiciale non cadit pro defectu formae". In the present case, pursuant to the
impugned order passed by the learned City Civil Court No.29, Ahmedabad, it
appears that it is not with loss of reasons and therefore, prima-facie, court
is not inclined to interfere in the same.
113\. Further, it is true and Court also joined with learned Advocate Mr.
Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant that so far as  Page
90 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT the passing off action is concerned, registration of the product is
not sine qua non nor conditio precedent, so merely registration of trade mark
of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs cannot drive for permanent rights of
user if one establishes prior user or passing off action in common law.
114\. Further, it is to be noted that the the trade mark of the Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs is a registered trade mark coupled with the registered
copy right in compared to the Appellant / Original Defendant who has just
applied in the market has "proposed to be used". Therefore, when the product
of present appellant/original defendant has not come in the market, they
started using the product of Tea like original plaintiff, which is prima
facie, in view of the learned Trial Court is infringing the rights of the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs in both ways i.e. passing off action in
trade mark as well as infringement of copyright. Therefore, even if the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have stated the "WAGH BAKRI PREMIUM TEA"
just before two years i.e. from the year 2019 then also it is prior user in
compared to the so called Appellant / Original Defendant, proposed to be used
which is still not registered and therefore also there is no scope of
interference in the order of the learned Trial Court.

JUDGMENT
115\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for the appellant has also
heavily placed reliance upon the various judgments which would be discussed
hereinafter, but at this juncture, the learned Trial Court has observed that
Order 7 Rule 11 CPC for which learned Advocate Mr. Shah has vehemently and
fervently argued that such discussion was not required under Order 7 Rule 11
of the CPC wherein learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi appearing with
learned Advocate Mr. Y.J.Trivedi for the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs has
replied that in the Reply filed by the Appellant / Original Defendant [written
statement of the present Appellant) was having such defence, but at this
juncture Order 7 Rule 11 is not required to be mentioned by the learned Trial
Court. Further, as such there is no detailed discussion on Order 7 Rule 11
CPC, but, by just mentioning the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC does not
drive this court to observe the order as perverse, illegal or capricious.
Further, it is to be mentioned that the observation on Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC
is discussed in the case of Toni & Guj Products Ltd. v. Shyam Sunder Nagpal
reported in 2013 SCC Online Del. 4712, in the impugned order.
116\. Further, learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah for the Appellant /
Original Defendant has also drawn the attention of this court in the
discussion on the quia timet action, which is not required, wherein,  Page 92
of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
this court is of the opinion that when the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs
has apprehension that its product will lose its credibility / goodwill if the
Appellant / Original Defendant start manufacturing, which is similar to the
Respondent's / Original Plaintiff's product. Upon such premises, the learned
Trial Court has rightly exercised the concept of quia timet action.
117\. Therefore, if the product is likely to cause confusion or to deceive the
purchasers as to source or origin of the trade mark or the goods to be sold in
future under the said mark irrespective of the fact; (i) whether goods
intended to be sold are competitive goods or not; (ii) whether the intention
to use of infringed trade mark is to trade or cash upon the reputation and
goodwill of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs earned over the years
through extensive advertisement and huge expenses and;
(iii) whether there is likelihood of real or tangible damage or injury to the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs or reasonable probability if the same would
take place. In other words, whether use of the trademark by the Appellant /
Original Defendant is likely to be associated with the Respondents' / Original
Plaintiffs' trade mark or business; and lastly, whether the hardship suffered
by the Respondents / Original Defendants would be greater than that of the
Appellant / Original Defendant if the injunction is not granted against the
Appellant / Original Defendant.  Page 93 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02
00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT Such aspect as discussed by way of
authority by the learned Trial Court is just and proper.
118\. The learned Trial Court has rightly discussed at page 90 of the judgment
in paragraph 79 that the relief of passing off can be based even on an
apprehension of threat of the Respondents' / Original Defendants' proposed
launch of their products as a quia timet action.
119\. The discussion made by the learned Trial Court in paragraph 79 of the
Judgment is reproduced herein below:
> "Para 79. Thus, it is clear from the aforesaid decision that the relief of
> passing off can be based even on an apprehension of threat of the
> defendant's proposed launch of their products as a Quia timet action.
> Therefore, as per the principles settled hereinabove, this Court is also of
> the view that as in the case of infringement of registered trade mark or
> passing off action, the intention and object of infringer is mainly to trade
> or cash upon widespread and invaluable goodwill and reputation established
> over the years at huge cost by the plaintiff and in the process there occurs
> a dilution of the trade mark if goods manufactured and sold by infringer

120\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul S. Shah has also placed reliance on the word
device as used in the application that the colour was not used  Page 95 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT but
here, prima facie, in the product of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs is
registered trade mark coupled with prior user and therefore merely in column
of application form the so-called orange colour is not used would not make
dis-entitlement of equitable relief. Further, as per settled principles of law
this Court is not required to re-appreciate the prima facie evidence neither
to insert anything more but to examine whether the order is passed by the
learned Trial Court is perverse, arbitrary, illegal or capricious or not.
121\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance on the aspect that
there are so many companies which are using identical orange colour. Therefore
also the Appellant / Original Defendant should not be prevented but the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs are dominus litus and if the Respondents /
Original Plaintiffs have taken quia timet action against the Appellant /
Original Defendant, upon such premises, this court cannot take into
consideration about the use of colour orange by other traders.
122\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has also submitted written notes
inviting the attention of this Court on the discrepancy and material
irregularity in the order passed by the learned Trial Court.
123\. It is urged that in the first para, it is with regard to the prayer of
temporary injunction at Exh.7 as prayed by the Respondents / Original  Page 96
of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs. In the second para it is with regard to the ad interim relief,
which cannot be granted in the nature of final relief. This Court is in full
agreement with the statement but after all, pursuant to the impugned order, it
appears that the learned Trial Court has discussed the equitable relief only
and in the operative portion of the order, equitable relief is granted, and
therefore, merely the prayer for interim relief and the final prayer in the
suit is matching, this court is not required to interfere with the granted
equitable relief.
124\. Learned Advocate Mr. Mehul Sharad Shah has stated that since there is no
discussion about the basic ingredients i.e. prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss and therefore the present Appeal from Order
is required to be remanded to the learned Trial Court for afresh adjudication.
But as discussed earlier, the learned Trial Court has through not titled all
the three ingredients of the equitable reliefs, like prima facie case, balance
of convenience and irreparable loss, but simultaneously, indirectly, the same
aspect is mentioned and discussed and lastly the learned Trial Court has made
the conclusion on this aspect. Further, this Court is in agreement with the
submission made by learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs that an art of writing judgment and order
differs from the Hon'ble Judges to Hon'ble Judges. In the opinion of this
Court also in  Page 97 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT civil cases having the same sets of facts and
circumstances, three Judges may differ in their opinion i.e. one may allow the
suit, the other may reject the suit and the third one may partly allow the
suit. Likewise in criminal justice system also, cases having the similar facts
and circumstances, one Judge may convict, the another may award acquittal and
the third Judge may impose part punishment. Therefore, this court is of the
opinion that there cannot be any straight jacket formula for writing a
judgment. The fact remains, be that as may be, the important fact is that
whether the material aspect to grant equitable relief is discussed or not.
125\. Fourthly, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has drawn the attention of this
Court on the aspect of no findings recorded upon the contentions made by the
learned Advocate for the Original Defendant / Appellant herein by the learned
Trial Court in the judgment and the observations made are not totally the
correct observation since many contentions of both the parties are discussed
and therefore such stand of the learned Trial Court is not tenable.
126\. It is also reiterated by the learned Advocate Mr. Shah that in various
paragraphs of the judgment i.e. paragraph 42 to 65 and also 68 to 91, the
learned Trial Court has not considered the relevancy but, as discussed
earlier, for example in the case of judgment of the Delhi High  Page 98 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT Court,
the learned Trial Judge has discussed the relevancy in less aspects and in
other cases also though not in detailed but few are discussed. But in view of
this Court, such aspect did not drive this Court as held to be perverse.
127\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also drawn the attention of this Court
that the trade name of both the parties are not deceptively and distinctively
similar i.e. "WAGH BAKRI" and "VIMAL" but in view of this Court, finding is
given by the learned Trial Court that the Court is of the prima facie opinion
that the Plaintiffs have clearly established the essential of goodwill and
reputation and chance of future loss by virtue of the use of such deceptively
similar trade name or device and therefore, the Plaintiffs have prima facie
case in their favour, therefore, merely having two different "TRADE NAME" does
not make strong defence of original defendant.
128\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance on different
authorities that would be discussed hereinafter so far as infringement of
copyright and passing off action is concerned.
129\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has submitted written note discussing on
infringement of trademark and submitted that it is merely a package  Page 99
of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
prepared in computer. There cannot be an artistic work in the orange colour
background and therefore since orange colour cannot be termed as artistic
work, any allegation of infringement of copyright would not be maintainable.
But, this Court is of the opinion that, at the beginning of discussion, when
this Court has prima facie compared the trade names coupled with trade, design
and artistic work, it appears that the learned Trial Court has rightly
exercised the discretionary power in favour of the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs.
130\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also discussed in his written note upon
the infringement of trademark and submitted that the trademarks bearing
registration no. 3075599, 4250078, 4250077 and 4250071 are pertaining to "WAGH
BAKRI STRONG AND REFRESHING PREMIUM TEA", however, there is no trademark for
the colour scheme and therefore no registration of colour orange or for colour
scheme in favour of the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs. Even other wise
'orange colour' as a single colour is not capable of being considered as
"Trademark" and therefore, the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs are not
entitled to institute the suit for infringement of such trademark.
131\. Further also, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has placed reliance upon six
options i.e. colour, device,f shape of goods, sound, three dimensional  Page
100 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT work and work mark. It is submitted that not a single registration
certificate is produced by the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs showing that
they have any registration of trademark in the category of 'orange colour'.
But, this Court is of the opinion that when the product is registered, upon
such premises, at this juncture, the Court is required to examine in Appeal,
only the aspects, which are discussed by the learned Trial Court, which are
perverse or not, arbitrary or not, capricious or not and illegal or not.
Therefore, when the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have a registered trade
mark, at this juncture, this court, would not prefer to sit in appeal as a
competent authority of IPR.
132\. So far as passing off action is concerned, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has
reiterated that there is no goodwill for 'orange colour', therefore no passing
off action would be maintainable for the 'orange colour' but the learned Trial
Court has discussed that if the Appellant / Original Defendant has used the
product which is identical to the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs, in that
case, the learned Trial Court has prima facie opined that the Appellant /
Original Defendant has established prior user and reputation, though not for
'orange colour' but for trade mark as a whole when the same is registered.
Upon that premises, one cannot make classification of each and every device.

JUDGMENT
133\. The reliance placed by learned Advocate Mr. Shah upon the judgment in
the case of Britannia Industries Ltd. v. ITC Limited (supra) is for passing of
action of Britannia Industries Ltd. and not for the infringement of trademark
or copyright as is there in the present case. Further, in the said judgment,
the Britannia Industries Ltd. was there in the business of biscuits for many
years whereas in the case on hand, the Appellant / Original Defendant is yet
to enter into Tea business, and therefore, this judgment is not helpful to the
Appellant / Original Plaintiffs.
134\. The reliance placed by learned Advocate Mr. Shah in the case of Cipla
Limited v. M.K. Pharmaceuticals (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the
present case as this judgment is related to prescribed medicines / tablets
with a particular colour and shape with blister form of packagings, wherein
the get up, colour scheme, arrangement of label are not relevant, whereas, in
the present case, the same are essential features of label. It was under these
circumstances that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has observed that there can be
no monopoly over colour and shape. Therefore the said judgment is not helpful
to the Appellant / Original Defendant.
Page 102 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT
135\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has placed reliance in the case of Colgate
Palmolive Company v. Patel & Ors. (supra) and more particularly paragraph 25,
29, 31, 33, 41 and 42. In that case, it was held that the disputed colour
'red' as well as 'red and white' combination is quite generic in nature and
common to toothpaste trade and therefore concession was not granted. Here
also, learned Advocate Mr. Shah has fervently argued that in the present case,
colour 'orange' and colour 'dark saffron' is generic in nature and therefore
the learned Trial Court has committed error in exercising the discretion. But,
in view of this court, in the aforesaid case, the issue was related to
monopoly of colour 'red' and 'white' and not on the entire get up and colour
scheme of arrangement and placement of label whereas in the present case of
the Appellant / Original Defendant, that is in the case of "WAGH BAKRI" the
case involved does not relate to claiming monopoly over 'orange' colour, but
having registered trademarks involving a label / device mark and registered
copyright on the entire lay out, get up, arrangement, colour scheme and
placement on leaves and other things. Lastly, in that case, the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court had suggested to the Defendasnt to alter the colour scheme and
other changes in the copied version of packaging to which, Defendant was
agreeable and accordingly the matter was put to an end. Therefore, this
authority is also not helpful to the Appellant / Original Defendant.
Page 103 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT
136\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance on the judgment in
case of Amrit Banaspati Co. Ltd. v. Suraj Industries Ltd. (supra) wherein the
Hon'ble Court has refused to grant any temporary injunction on the ground
that, simply because the colour of the two pouches was dark blue and the
writing on those pouches are in white colour, will not make the pouches to be
of similar nature, even prima facie and in so far as the use of this colour is
there, it is not prohibited. The denfendants have brought on record samples of
various pouches of this dark blue colour and of light blue colour on record
being used by other concerns. But, in view of this Court, the aforesaid
authority for passing off action and not for infringement of trade mark or
copyright and also not involving a device mark / label with a particular get
up colour scheme, arrangement of label etc. as it is there in the present
case. Therefore the said judgment is also not helpful to the Appellant /
Original Defendant.
137\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has further placed reliance on the Kerly's Law
of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 15th Edition on page no. 652, wherein it is
observed that, it is usually true in some degree that a trader's goods are
recognized as his by their general appearance, or 'get up'. Accordingly
resemblance of get-up is not uncommonly an ingredient  Page 104 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT in
passing off, and it is possible for imitation of get up alone to amount to
passing off. But, with respect, the present case is not of solely passing off
whereas the present case is of registered mark coupled with registered
copyright and therefore, this discussion is not required to be discussed in
length.
138\. The reliance placed by learned Advocate Mr. Shah in case of Parle
Products Limited v. Bakemans Industries Limited (supra) is also not applicable
to the facts of the present case. The said judgment is not a good law in view
of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Parle Products (P) Ltd.
vs. J.A. & Co. Mysore (supra).
139\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance upon the discussion
of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Cadila Healthcare v. Cadila
Pharmaceutical (supra) wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has rejected the
adoption of the English principles regarding the weightage to be given to the
dissimilarities, however, Hon'ble Apex Court has not stated that the
principles concerning the colour combination as laid down in various English
judgment would not be relevant for the Indian Jurisdiction. In paragraph 33 of
the said judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that the English cases
would be relevant in understanding essential feature and therefore considering
the long line of English as well as American judgments as narrated in the
commentary of  Page 105 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names and
narrated by various Hon'ble High Court (i.e. Britania Industries v. ITC Ltd.),
it is clear that it would be very difficult for anyone to claim passing off
solely on the basis of colour combination as essential feature. Learned
Advocate Mr. Shah has submitted that In such circumstances, learned Trial
Court out to have appreciated that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs have
no prima facie case of passing off and therefore injunction ought not to have
been granted.
140\. In the opinion of this Court, this submission by the learned Advocate
Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant is on the basis of the
judgment in case of S.M. Dye Chem Limited (supra) which was replied by the
learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs, who has ultimately argued that the law laid down in this judgment
has been expressly held to be bad in the later judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Cadila Healthcare v. Cadila Pharmaceutical (supra) wherein paragraph
17 to 12 are mainly on the ground that two English judgments relied upon in
the case of S.M. Dye Chem Limited (supra) and Payton & Co. vs. Snelling
Lampard & Co . (supra) are not applicable to Indian conditions and the
judgment of S.M.Dye Chem Limited (supra) cannot be referred to and relied
upon.  Page 106 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
141\. This Court is in full agreement with the submission made by learned
Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi for the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs
that the judgment is required to be referred to as a whole and not in the
isolation form, once the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that both the English
judgments are not applicable to the Indian conditions. Upon such premises,
this court is not in a position to discuss anything more except non-
application of S.M.Dye Chem Limited (surpa) in the present case.
142\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has lastly placed reliance upon the fact that
the goods under consideration is not ordinary tea which is sold in loose form
to the general public but it is a premium variety of the tea targeted towards
the middle as well as upper middle class people who will be aware of the "WAGH
BAKRI" and "VIMAL" as two different brands as both of them have distinct
identity and therefore considering the nature of goods as well as targeted
audience also there is no possibility of passing off as alleged by the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs. But, this court is of the opinion that it
is an undisputed fact that the product of the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs is a registered trade mark coupled with registered copyright as
discussed earlier. Further, this Court at this juncture, while traveling first
appellate court under Order 43 Rule 1 and Rule 2 of CPC as equity appellate
court  Page 107 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT wherein trial is yet to begin before the Trial Court.
Therefore, be that as may be, at this juncture, when the learned Trial Court
has observed that the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs has prima facie case
coupled with irreparable loss and balance of convenience, which, in view of
this court, is not perverse, arbitrary, illegal, capricious and not against
the settled principles of law. Therefore, merely middle class and upper middle
class people will be aware of "WAGH BAKRI" and "VIMAL", has two different
brands and therefore it cannot be said that the learned Trial Court has
committed any mistake.
143\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
also placed reliance on the judgment in case of White Hudson & Co. Ltd. v.
Asian Organisation Ltd. reported in (1965) R.P.C. 45 (PC Singapore). The facts
and circumstances are different. Further, latest law is discussed. Therefore,
this judgment is not helpful to the Applicant / Original Defendant.
144\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance on the judgment in
case of Kellogg Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai (supra), but in the opinion
of this Court, the said judgment is also not found to be a good law in later
judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court  Page 108 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue
Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT in the case of N. Rangarao &
Sons Vs. Anil Garg (supra) since the reliance was placed on the very English
Judgment referred to above as well as the English judgment in the case of
S.M.Dye Chem Limited (supra).
145\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance upon the judgment in
case of Kuber Khaini Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Prabhoolal Ramratan Das Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
Here also, the law laid down by the said judgment is not a good law since this
judgment has placed reliance in English Judgment in the case of Payton & Co.
vs. Snelling Lampard & Co. (supra) which has been declared by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in paragraph 20 of the judgment in case of Cadila Healthcare v.
Cadila Pharmaceutical (supra).
146\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also placed reliance on the judgment in
case of K. Narayanan vs. S. Murli (supra), wherein this judgment does not
apply to the present case since the injunction was denied in the said case
mainly on two grounds;
> (a) The Plaintiff's mark was not registered and his application for
> registration was pending, on the basis whereof, it had filed a Suit for
> passing of for injuncting the other side; and  Page 109 of 124 Downloaded on
> : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT
> (b) Plaintiff has suppressed certain important facts;
But, in the present case, the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs has a
registered trade mark and copy rights, whereby, it has acquired a statutory
recognition to use the same to the exclusion of rest of the world. Therefore,
this Court is of the opinion that the said judgment in case of K. Narayanan v.
S. Murli (supra) is not helpful to the Appellant / Original Defendant.
147\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
placed reliance on the judgment in case of Dhodha House and Ors. v. S.K.
Maingi & Ors. reported in MANU / SC / 2524 / 2005. In this case, case was of
jurisdiction with trademark, here in the present case different facts and
circumstances, since registered trademark and copyright of the original
plaintiff have not applicable and helpful to the Appellant / Original
Defendant.
148\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
placed reliance on the judgment in case of Skyline Education Institute (Pvt. )
Ltd. v. S.L.Vaswani & Ors. Reported in MANU / SC / 0009 / 2010. Facts and
circumstances are different and the ratio in this judgment is not helpful to
the Appellant / Original Defendant but is  Page 110 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue
Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT helpful to the stand of the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs for alleged generic name.
149\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
placed reliance on the judgment in case of Rolex Sa v. Alex Jewellery Pvt.
Ltd. & Ors. reported in MANU / DE / 0796 /2009. Facts and circumstances are
different and the ratio in this judgment is not helpful to the Appellant /
Original Defendant but is helpful to the stand of the Respondents / Original
Plaintiffs for alleged generic name.
150\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
placed reliance on the judgment in case of Express Bottlers Services Private
Ltd. v. Pepsico Inc. & Ors. reported in MANU / WB / 0158 / 1988\. Facts and
circumstances are different and the ratio in this judgment is also not helpful
to the Appellant / Original Defendant but is helpful to the stand of the
Respondents / Original Plaintiffs for alleged generic name.
151\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
further placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Vijay Kumar Ahuja v.
Lalita Ahuja reported in MANU / DE / 1278 / 2001. The facts and circumstances
are different herein. This is an ex parte injunction by  Page 111 of 124
Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT the
plaintiffs whereas in the case on hand it is bipartite. Therefore, this
judgment is also helpful the the Appellant / Original Defendant.
152\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
further placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Vidarbha Distillers v.
Vidarbha Bottlers Pvt. Ltd. Reported in MANU / MH / 1197 / 2004. In this
judgment the Court has laid down the following ratio decidendi:
> "When neither it is shown that Appellant is originator of design nor there
> has been any phonetical similarity between products of parties, Appellant
> cannot be entitled to interim relief."
Therefore, in the opinion of this Court, the facts in the case on hand are
different and therefore this judgment is also not helpful to the Appellant /
Original Defendant.
153\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
further placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Bharat Hotels Limited
v. Unison Hotels Limited reported in MANU / DE / 0276 / 2004\. Here also ex
parte injunction is not applicable to the facts of the case on hand. Therefore
this judgment is not helpful to the Appellant / Original Defendant.

JUDGMENT
154\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
further placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Seema Arshad Zaheer and
Ors. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai & Ors. reported in MANU / SC /
2420 /2006. In this judgment the Hon'ble Court has observed as under:
> "But where the Plaintiffs do not make out a prima facie case for grant of an
> injunction and the documents produced clearly show that the structures are
> unauthorised, the court may not grant a temporary injunction merely on the
> ground of sympathy or hardship."
Therefore, the facts in the case on hand are different in the view of this
Court.
155\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
also placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Camlin Private Limited v.
National Pencil Industries reported in MANU / DE / 0241 / 1988\. Here in this
case also the facts and circumstances are different and therefore, this
judgment is not helpful to the Appellant / Original Defendant.

JUDGMENT
156\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah for the Appellant / Original Defendant has
placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Christian Louboutin SAS v.
Abubaker & Ors. Reported MANU / DE / 1983 / 2018. In this case the Hon'ble
Court has observed as under:
> "Use of a single colour of Plaintiff did not qualify single colour to be a
> Trade mark in view of provisions of Sections 2(m) and 2(zb) of Act. Also,
> Section 30(2) (a) of Act, in facts of present case, was a complete
> disentitlement to reliefs claimed by Plaintiff on basis of plaint."
157\. It is also true, as per this authority, that use of single colour of the
plaintiff, did not qualify single colour to be trademark but in the present
case, in addition to colour, there are so many similarities such as;
> (a) The tag line of both the trademarks start with "PREMIUM". The tagline
> for "VIMAL" is "PREMIUM CTC LEAF TEA" while that of "WAGH BAKRI" is "PREMIUM
> LEAF TEA" which is likely to confuse the public at large.
> (b) The cup and plate used as a shape for the trademark are deceptively
> similar with white colour and similar shape of green leaves placed on the
> plate.
> (c) The logo of VIMAL is placed in oval shaped circle with a reddish
> background and that of a WAGH BAKRI's logo is also similar to it with a
> reddish background.

> (d) The background of the logo for VIMAL uses same colour that of WAGH BAKRI

> Therefore, in the opinion of this Court, prima facie, it drives as "copied"

It appears on the basis of few authorities, over all, the Court is required to
examine similarity from the point of view of the common man with average
intelligence and imperfect recollection, since it is registered trade  Page

JUDGMENT mark with registered copyright and one is not supposed to place both
the competing marks side by side to draw dissimilarities and to find out
whether the words and colours used therein are generic and descriptive or not.
159\. Therefore, the learned Trial Court has rightly placed reliance that in
the case of infringement of trade mark or copyright, injunction is required to
be issued. However, learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also placed
reliance on the judgment in the case of Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. Vs.
Sudhir Bhatia, reported in (2004) 3 SCC 90, which, in the opinion of this
Court is also applicable to the facts of the present case.
160\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also placed reliance on
the judgment in case of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. v. M/s West Coast
Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd. reported in 2012 (3) GLH 110 wherein it was held
that the Appellate Court has come to the conclusion that the discretionary
order passed by the learned Trial Court is perverse, capricious, arbitrary and
contrary to the settled principle of law regarding, grant of refusing to grant
temporary injunction and held that it is not the function of the appellate
court to reassess the evidence adduced by both the sides pending the suit and
it is also not the function of the Appellate Court to come to any different
conclusion than  Page 119 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021
C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT the one arrived at by the Trial Court and further it
is held that it is not in the interest of the parties if the Court elaborately
deals with the matter of merits at the interim stage as it is likely that the
same would prejudice the case of the either side. Therefore, this Court is in
full agreement with this submission made by learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal
Trivedi that the Court is not required to go in detailed merits of the case
since it prejudices the case of the either side, since the trial is yet to
commence.
161\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also placed reliance on
the judgment in case of N.R.Dangre v. Whirlpool Corporation reported in (1996)
5 SCC 714 wherein the principles of equitable relief is discussed and the
injunction is granted on equitable principles. The same is also discussed in
this case and therefore there is no need to repeat the same.
162\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also placed reliance on
the judgment in case of Adani Exports Ltd. v. Marketing Service Incorporated
reported in (2005) 2 GLH 156 wherein it was held that if there is no infirmity
found in the order of the Trial Court, injunction against encashment of bank
guarantee and letter of credit should not be granted except where fraud or
irretrievable damage is contended and prima facie established. Therefore, in
sum and substance,  Page 120 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST
2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV JUDGMENT if there is no infirmity found in order of the
Trial Court, in that case, the Appellate Court is not required to interfere.
163\. In the case of Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products
Ltd. Reported in AIR 1960 SC 142, it was held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that
reputation among general public should attach to trade mark and not to maker
of goods.
164\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Kamal Trivedi has also placed reliance on
the judgment in case of Rangoli Chemfoods Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Brine Industries
Ltd. Reported in 2013 (53) PTC 606 (Guj), Jagdish Gopal Kamnath v. Lime &
Chilli Hospitality Services reported in 2015 (62) PTC (Bom) and also Blue Hill
Logistics Pvt. Ltd v. Ashok Leyland Ltd. Reported in 2011 (48) PTC 564 (Mad).
In the opinion of Court, to some extent, principles are applicable to the
facts of the present case.
165\. In case of Allied Blenders and Distillers Pvt. Ltd. v. Sentino Bio
Products Pvt. Ltd. (supra), it is held that if the injunction order is not
confirmed, not only the plaintiff but the unwary customers who cannot be
compensated in terms of money would also suffer in case injunction is not
granted. Application for grant of injunction therefore allowed. In the  Page
121 of 124 Downloaded on : Tue Mar 02 00:34:41 IST 2021 C/AO/2/2021 CAV
JUDGMENT present case also, the learned Trial Court, would have not granted
injunction, there are all the chances of loss to unwary customers who cannot
be compensated in terms of money.
166\. Learned Advocate Mr. Shah has also lastly submitted that if the
injunction is not granted, in that case the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs
have no irreparable loss since they are continuing in business but when the
injunction is granted, in that case all business of the Appellant / Original
Defendant would be ruined for which there is no chance of assessment of loss.
But, such stand is not tenable in view of earlier discussions made herein
above.
167\. Therefore, also this court is required to interfere and set aside the
order passed by the learned Trial Court. But, as discussed earlier, the
learned Trial Court has not committed any mistake neither in form of order as
perverse, or arbitrary, or capricious, or illegal and therefore, this court is
not inclined to interfere in the order of the learned Trial Court. Hence, I
reply Point No. (i) in negative and answer Point no. (ii) as under: (L)
CONCLUDING REMARKS:
168\. Upon all such discussions and the reliance placed by both the sides on
different authorities / citations, it appears that now it is prima facie  Page

JUDGMENT Res integra, that instead of dissimilarity of trade products, the
Court has to see prima facie, similarities in the product, since the man of
average prudence or average intelligence cannot be deceived in dealing with
purchasing the goods in the market, since in the present case, the product Tea
("WAGH BAKRI PREMIUM") is such, every type of persons may purchase including,
middle class, rich person and others, they may not be deceived by purchasing
the goods of so called Appellant / Original Defendant. Prima facie, by
allowing product of the Appellant / Original Defendant, will cause confusion
in the minds of public at large. Further, it is pertinent to note that the
Appellant / Original Defendant has yet not started manufacturing fully in the
market as compared to the Respondents / Original Plaintiffs and therefore quia
timet action was the need of the hour in the view of the learned Trial Court,
and therefore, when the discretion is exercised by the learned Trial Court,
the Appellant / Original Defendant has knocked the door of this Court, ex
facie the Appellant / Original Defendant failed to rebut prima facie case of
the Respondents / Original Plaintffs as Absque injuria. As discussed herein
above, in fleri there is no infirmity in the order passed by the learned Trial
Court and the same is in accordance with the settled principles of law and,
therefore, the present Appeal from Order and Civil Application, filed by the
Appellant / Original Defendant is devoid of any merit and deserves to be
dismissed and accordingly stands dismissed with no order as to costs. Notice

Court No. 29, Ahmedabad below Exh. 7 for interim injunction in Civil Suit No.
884/2020 is hereby confirmed. However, it is made clear that, in the facts and

preferably within 10 months from the date of receipt of the copy of this
judgment and conclude the trial, preferably, on or before 31.1.2022, without
