2\. The grounds of appeal raised b y the Revenue read as under:
> "1 The Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the disallowance
> of commission to foreign agents amounting to Rs. 4,63,62,693/- paid without
> properly appreciating the facts that the assessee was unable t o lead
> evidence to prove the factum of actual rendering of services by such
> recipients. Reference in this regard is made to the decision of Hon'ble
> Supreme Court in the case of Prem ier Breweries Ltd vs CI T Cochin 2015 56
> Taxm ann.com 361 (SC) .
> 1.1 Without prejudice to t he above, the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law on
> facts in deleting the disallowance u/s. 40(a)(i ) of the IT. Act on export
> commission payments made to the Non-resident Agents solely relying on the
> decision of the Hon'bl e Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Toshuku Ltd.
> (1980) 125 ITR 525 (SC) which is no more applicable in vi ew of the
> subsequent amendments brought i n the IT. Act.
> 1.2 The Ld. CI T(A) has failed to appreciate t hat such payments ar e
> chargeable to tax in I ndia under the provisi ons of Section 9(1)(vii) of
> the IT. Act and, therefore, the assessee was required to deduct TDS on such
> remittances."
3\. When the matter was called for hearing, the learned DR for the Revenue
relied upon the order of the AO.
4\. The learned AR for the assessee, on the other hand, submitted that the
issue is covered b y assessee's own case in AY 2014-15.
5\. The disallowance of commission to foreign agents amounting to
Rs.4,63,62,693/- paid b y the assessee in question. The CIT(A) has dealt with
the issue as under:
"2.3 Decision I have carefully considered the facts of the case, the
assessment order and the written submission of the appellant. The AO has dis
allowed the commission pai d to foreign agent namely; M/s. Stone Hill
Electromechanical Contracting, Fab House Technologies LLC & Vibgyour
International FZ LLC amounting to Rs.4,63,62,693/- by holding that the income
arising on account of commission payable to overseas agent was deemed to
accrue or arise in India and was accordingly taxable under the Provisions of
section 5 (2)(b) read with sect ion 9(1)(i ) of Income Tax Act. It has further
been observed by the AO that the appellant company had failed to comply with
the Provisions of section 195(2). He has al so held, I T A N o . 3 7 0 / Ah d

- 1 4 - 3 -
> without prejudice to t he main findings that, the appellant had also failed
> to prove the commissions paid to the agents were genuine and justified. The
> AO observed that the appellant has not proved the identity and the evidences
> of services r endered by the foreign commission agents for which commission
> was pai d by the appellant. No copy of agreement or documentary evidences in
> support of commis sion payment was given by the assessee which could justify
> the reasonableness of the commission payment to the non-resident as well as
> genuineness of the expenses incurred for the purpose of business. The AO
> observed the fact that the age.it had rendered s ervices abroad in the form
> of s oliciting the orders and the commission is to be remitted to them abr
> oad is wholly irrelevant for the purpose of determining the question of
> accrual and arise of income, since the income from commission payment to non
> - resi dent has arose in India and i s taxable under the Act, in view of the
> specific provisions of section 5(2)(b) r .w.s . 9(1)(i ) of I.T. Act, 1961,
> the pr ovisions of section 195 would t herefore be applicable.
> 2.4. The appellant on the other hand, in its detailed written submission,
> has claimed that the Provisions of Section 5(2)(b) read with section 9
> (1)(i) of Income Tax Act were not applicable in its case. The income has
> been earned abroad and, is therefore, riot taxable in India. It has also
> given detailed evidences to prove that the commission paid was genuine. The
> appellant claimed that there was no PE of the foreign agents / nun -
> residents in India, therefore, no TDS was required to be deduct ed from such
> payments.
> 2.5. It was claimed that the goods were exported through agent who basically
> was from UAE. The appellant also made sales to other countries like Tanzania
> and Moz ambique. It is further claimed these overseas agent was providing
> export orders by searching / inquiring export - import from countries spread
> over world-wide along with other services.
> 2.6. He also provided the relevant details to the AO during assessment
> proceedings through it s letter dated 18/11/2016 as under:-
> i) Statement of all transactions entered into with M/s. Stone Hill
> Electromechanical Contracting, Fab Hous e Technologies LLC & Vibgyour

> Fob House Technologies LLC S, Vibgyour International FZ LLC have also been
> paid in the preceding years and the AO has allowed such commission payments
> and no disallowance in this regar d has been made in the scrutiny assessment

> obligation to make withholding tax in terms of beneficial provisions of
> section 90(2) of the 1. T. Act. The appellant also provided to the AO, the
> evidences along with bank payment details realizing the export proceeds,
> company payment advice, For m No.15CA and 15CB, credit not e of overseas
> agent, i nvoice for export by company with commission amount etc. was
> furnished as evidences for justification of commission to overseas agent and
> the same have not been controverted in the assessment proceedings. Thus , it
> was submitted that the payment of commission to overseas agent was part of
> export of pr oducts and an important mediatory channel to book the export
> orders as well as to take care of realization of export proceeds. Thus , the
> commission payment was genuine and paid thr ough banking channel s on export
> orders pr ocured. The same were made for the purpose of business in prudent
> way to increase export and increase customer base i n foreign countries.
> 2.8. With regard to the provisions of section 9(1)(i ), it was submi tted
> that the overseas agent was not doing any bus iness in India. It was merely
> providing export orders to facilitate appellant. Further, the overseas agent
> did not had any business connection in India. It was further claimed that
> there is no income deemed to accrue or arise in India in view of the
> explanations to the provisions of section 9(1)(i ) of the I.T. Act as the
> overseas agent had r endered services outs ide India and the commission was
> also paid to them outside India. Hence, there was no obligation to deduct
> the tax from s uch commission payments as per the provi sions of section 195
> of the I. T. Act.
> 2.9. Thus, it has been submitted that the identity and genuinenes s of the
> overseas commission agent is proved with the evidences such as, credit notes
> to overseas agents, export invoices, s hipping bills, bank certificate for
> export realization, copy of Form No. 15CA 8, 15CB and commission payment
> etc. as discus sed above.
> 2.10. Having consider ed the facts and submissions, the issues which are to
> be examined and decided are as under:-
> 1\. Whether the commission paid to foreign agents is taxable in India by
> virtue of the provisions of section 5 (2)(b) read with section 9 (1) (i) of
> Income Tax Act.
> 2\. Whether the provisions of section 195(2) were applicable on the
> appellant and he s hould have deducted t ax and in case of no deduction he
> should have obtained a no deduction certificate from the AO. And
> 3\. Whether the commission paid was genuine and the services have been
> rendered.

> 2.11. Regarding the first issue it is noted from the evidences given by the
> appellant as well as noted by the AO in hi s order that the services have
> been rendered by the foreign agents outside India. The sales were booked by
> them in other countries or for the country for which they have been
> appointed as commis sion agents. None of the activities soliciting the
> clients and procuring the orders has taken place in India. The goods were
> being delivered by the appellant company in the other country. The
> activities of procuring the payment on behalf of the appellant company were
> also done abroad. The AO was theref ore, incorrect to hold that the source
> of income lies in India as the s ales have been made from India. The
> provisions of Income Tax Act clearly pr ovide that the tax would be deducted
> on the income which is taxable in India. The activity of earning the income
> is not the sale but soliciting the sales by commission agent. Though this
> activity is linked to the sales of the company but it cannot be said that
> the income has been derived from sales which has been made from India. The
> income has been derived from the activity of soliciting the sates on behalf
> of the appellant company. The agent has carried out all the activity on the
> foreign soil and none of its activity is in India therefore, it cannot be
> said that the income has accrued or arisen in India and the source of income
> was in India. Ther e is no fact br ought out by the AO in the order as well
> as observed by me during the course of appellate proceedings to indicat e
> that the services have been rendered in India.
> 2.12. The judgment of honourable Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs .
> Toshoku Limited [ 125 ITR 525 (SC)] is important on the issue, whereby it
> has been held that commission earned by t he non-resident for acting as the-
> selling agent for the Indian exporter, wherein such nonresi dent was
> rendering services from outside India does not accrue in India. In the
> present case before me also, the foreign selling commission agent is
> resident of foreign country, from where the procurement service had been
> provided fur which the commission has been paid, and therefore, the issue is
> directly and squarel y covered by the Apex Court decision.
> 2.13. Regarding the observation of the AO that the income is deemed to
> accrue or arise in India by applying the provisions of section 9 (l )(t ),
> it is seen that there is no fact on record to indicate that the agent had
> any permanent establishment in India. The agent had its office on the
> foreign soil and nothing on record that it had PE in India. Further the
> assessing officer has also not pointed out any such f act in its order which
> indicate that there was any such office of the overseas agent in India which
> attract the deeming provisions. Further the observation that the source of
> income was in India is also not proper as it has clearly been discussed in
> the preceding paragraphs that none of the services have been rendered in
> India and source of income cannot be said t o be in India as the s ource of
> income is the services rendered and not the sales. There is no business
> connection in India from which the income has been earned, there is no
> property through or from which the income has been ear ned. Therefore, the
> provisions of secti on 9 (1)(i) also cannot be applied.
> 2.14. Reliance is placed on the judgement of honourable Supreme Court in the
> case of GE India Technology Centre Private Lim ited 327 ITR 456 and the
> judgement of honourable I TAT Mumbai in the case of our Ardesi B Cursetjee &
> Sons Ltd. 115 TTJ 916.

> m i t e d ] A. Y . 2 0 1 3 - 1 4 - 6 -
> 2.15. Therefore, in view of the preceding discussion the AO was not
> justified to hold that the commission payable to the overseas agent was
> doomed to accr ue or arise in India and is taxable under the Act in view of
> the specific provisions of sections 5 (?)(h) read with section 9 (l )(i ) of
> Income Tax Act.
> 2.16. Regarding the issue of obtaining no deduction certificate under
> section 196 ii is seen that for the applicability of the provisions of this
> section, the sum must be chargeable under the provisions of the Income Tax
> Act. Section 195 provides for deduction of tax by the person responsible for
> paying to a non-resident any interest or any other sum chargeable under the
> Provisions of the Act. It is clear that the payment was not the interest. It
> has to be seen whether the payment is covered under the term "any other sum
> chargeable under the provision of this Act". It has been observed in the
> preceding discussion that income was not chargeable to tax as it has not
> been received in India nor it has accrued or arisen in India directly or
> indirectly. Therefore, once the income is not taxable there is no liability
> to deduct tax and therefore, it was not obligatory for the appellant to
> deduct tax in view of this, there was no violation of the pr ovisions of
> section 195 and the appellant was also not required to pay no deduction
> certificate from the AO.
> 2.17. The last issue which is to be adj udicated is that whether the
> commission payments were genuine and the services were render ed. The AO has
> briefly dealt with the issue in his order. The appellant has placed on
> record several documents which indicate that the agent have r endered
> services prior to the actual sales as well as subsequently also. It is
> further observed that the payments have been made through banking channel
> and are duly documented. The appellant has made commission payment to agent
> during the year and it has pr ovided copies of agreements. The appellant has
> given s atisfactory evidences in r espect of all commission payment, and
> therefore, considering the overall f uels and circumstances the payment made
> to the agent is taken as genuine. Accordingly, in my considered opinion the
> appellant has given satisfactory evidences regarding the services rendered
> by the agent and the genuineness of payment of commission.
> 2.18. The AO has also placed reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Authority
> of Advance Rulings in the case of SKF Boilers and Dri ers (P.) Ltd. (2012)
> 18 Taxmann 325 and Rajiv Malhotra (2006) 284 ITR 564 (Delhi ). The
> judgements are not applicabl e to the present facts as there are several
> other decisions of Hon'ble ITAT, Mumbai in the case of ACI T (International
> Taxation) Vs. Star Cruise India Travel Services Pvt. Ltd. [ 14 ITR (T) 282 [
> Mum] , CLSA Li mited Vs. ITO (International Taxation) [ 56 SOT 254] , which
> hold that such kind of commission is not taxable in India and accordingl y
> no liability to deduct tax was there. Fur ther the decision of honour abl e
> Supreme Court of India in the case of CIT vs. Toshoku Lim ited 125 ITR 525,
> still prevails as on date and is the law of the land as regards
> applicability of TDS pr ovisions to commission paid to overseas/non-resident

> 6\. As stated, the identical issue came up for hearing before the Tribunal
> in ITA No. 355/Ahd/2018. The relevant operative para reads as under:
> "8. We have heard the Learned counsel appear ing for the parties, we have

> 2.11. Regarding the first issue it is noted from the evidence, given by the

7\. A perusal of the order of the C IT(A) shows that the first appellate
authorit y has appreciated the facts in perspective and applied the law
correctl y. In view of the decision of the co-ordinate bench of Tribunal in
assessee's own case concerning AY 2014-15, we do not see an y perceptible
reason to re-examine the issue. No new facts were placed before us on behalf
of the Revenue for doing so. We thus decline to interfere with the order of
