ORDER R.M.S. Khandeparkar, J.
1\. This revision application arises from the order dated 17th February, 1999
passed by the District Judge at Margao in Civil Suit No. 1/96. By the impugned
order, the trial Court has dismissed the application dated 29-3-1997 filed by
the petitioners herein for rejection of the plaint in the said Civil Suit No.
1/1996. The application was filed under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil
Procedure Code complaining that the plaint did not disclose any cause of
action.
2\. The petitioners as well as the respondent have filed written submissions,
apart in addition to the oral submissions made by the learned Advocates for
the parties. In support of their submissions, they have relied upon the
decisions in the matter of Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. v. Eastern
India Motion Picture Association and others, ; Burroughs Wellcome (India) Ltd.
v. Uni-Sole Pvt. Ltd. and another, re-ported in ; Smt. Mannu Bhandari v. Kala
Vikas Pictures Pvt. Ltd. and another, ; K.A. Venugopala Setty v. Dr.
of no help to decide the issue pertaining to non-disclosure of the cause of
action. The primary requirement for invoking the provisions of Order VII, Rule
11 of the Civil Procedure Code is the non-disclosure of cause of action in the
plaint. The said decision is undoubtedly on merits in relation to the issue as
to whether in view of the provisions of Copyright Act, 1957 the existing
lyrics is capable of assignment and whether right can be defeated by the same
by engaging some person. Being so, the said decision is of no assistance at
the stage of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code. As regards the
other decisions relied upon by the learned Advocates they are clearly
distinguishable on facts and therefore are of no assistance in the matter.
9\. The trial Court in its discretion, which has been judiciously exercised,
rejected the contention of the petitioners that the plaint does not disclose
the cause of action. It cannot be said that the trial Court has acted
arbitrary or in improper exercise of its jurisdiction while rejecting the
contentions of the petitioners as regards the non-disclosure of cause of
action in the plaint.

3\. Upon hearing the learned Advocates and on perusal of records, including
the written submissions, it is clear that the only ground on which the relief
for rejecting the plaint under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure was sought for was non-disclosure of cause of action in the plaint.
4\. It was the case of the petitioners that as per the pleadings in the
plaint, the claim of the respondents/petitioners was that the song
'Chandnyache Rati' was musically composed and tuned by the respondent and
therefore he had become the owner of the Musical composition of the said song.
On ac-count of the alleged infringement of Copyright, the suit has been filed.
On the other hand, it is the case of the petitioners that considering the
provisions of law in Copyright Act, 1957, there was no cause of action in
favour of the respondent to file the suit and the same is evident from the
pleadings in the plaint.
5\. The plea that there is no cause of action is different from the plea that
the plaint itself does not disclose any cause of action. Absence of cause of
action in a suit is not the same thing as non-disclosure of cause of action in
the plaint. The correctness or otherwise of the plea in the plaint
constituting the cause of action is beyond the scope of the decision for the
purpose of applicability of the provisions of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil
Procedure Code.
6\. Besides, as per the submissions on the part of the petitioners themselves,
originally the suit was in relation to infringement of Copyright of the song
'Chandnyache Rati as musically composed and tuned by the respondent whereas
during the pendency of this revision, and after passing of the impugned order,
the plaint has been amended by the respondent. The amendment introduced in the
plaint reads thus :
"..... thus became owner and author of the Copyright of the musical com-
position and tune of the poem CHANDNEACHE RATI and GOENCHE MHOJEA GOENKARANO
and therefore musical composition and tune of the plaintiff is protected under
the Copyright Act which is still continued and therefore no other person can
infringe the Copyright of the plaintiff and therefore plaintiff became
exclusive owner of the Copyright work. The Copyright work of the plaintiff
still subsists."
7\. Undisputedly, pursuant to the said amendment to the plaint, the claim of
the respondent may be justified to certain extent. Indeed the written
submissions in that regard by the petitioners read thus :---
"Indeed the claim of the plaintiff may be justified to the extent he claims to
have done musical composition of the song and given tune to the song.
The question is whether as per the provisions of the Act, once record is made
to what extent the rights of the musical composer are protected and he can
restrain the release of the record of fresh record and for that matter fresh
audio cassette, even if it is with the same musical composition as contended
by the plaintiff."
8\. The learned Advocate for the petitioners has relied upon the decision of
the Apex Court in Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. v. Eastern India Motion
Picture Association and others (supra). Moreover the decision therein can be
of no help to decide the issue pertaining to non-disclosure of the cause of
action. The primary requirement for invoking the provisions of Order VII, Rule
11 of the Civil Procedure Code is the non-disclosure of cause of action in the
plaint. The said decision is undoubtedly on merits in relation to the issue as
to whether in view of the provisions of Copyright Act, 1957 the existing
lyrics is capable of assignment and whether right can be defeated by the same
by engaging some person. Being so, the said decision is of no assistance at
the stage of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code. As regards the
other decisions relied upon by the learned Advocates they are clearly
distinguishable on facts and therefore are of no assistance in the matter.
9\. The trial Court in its discretion, which has been judiciously exercised,
rejected the contention of the petitioners that the plaint does not disclose
the cause of action. It cannot be said that the trial Court has acted
arbitrary or in improper exercise of its jurisdiction while rejecting the
contentions of the petitioners as regards the non-disclosure of cause of
action in the plaint.
10\. In the result therefore, no case is made out for interference in the
impugned order. The revision application therefore fails and is hereby
summarily rejected.
11\. Application dismissed.
