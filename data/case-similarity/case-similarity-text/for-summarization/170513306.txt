Since we are taking up the appeal itself for disposal, the stay application
filed by Revenue is disposed of.
being currently probed/investigated by DRI. What is expressed in this para-29
above is purely our personal views based on the events and circumstances
presented before us.
30\. In view of the foregoing discussions and our findings as above, we set
aside both the Order-in-Original and the impugned order-in-appeal and remand
the matter to the original authority with a direction to examine the issue
afresh in the light of our findings contained in this order and to proceed to
determine the issue. The original authority is also directed to take into
consideration the outcome of the investigation proceedings initiated by D.R.I
while deciding the issue.
31\. In the result, the Revenue appeal is allowed by way of remand in the
above terms. Stay application filed by Revenue also gets disposed. This order
is subject to the outcome of two writ petitions pending before the Hon'ble
High Court of Madras.
    (Proceedings dictated in court on 13.11.2015
    and order pronounced in open court on 08.03.2016)
filed by Revenue is disposed of.
2\. The brief facts of the case are that respondents M/s.3M India Ltd.,
Bangalore imported capital goods, raw materials, finished products from their
principal company M/s.3M USA and their related subsidiaries located in other
countries. Since the respondent and the supplier are related, the issue was
dealt with by Special Valuation Branch by issue of Circular No.138/91
dt.23.10.91. Subsequently, the said circular was renewed / reviewed
periodically vide OIO No.326/2001-SVB dt. 30.3.2001, OIO No.3349/2005 dt.
8.2.2005 and another OIO No.7171/2008 dt. 8.2.2008. From 1991 till 2008,
renewal orders has been issued accepting the declared price for the purpose of
transaction value. Subsequently, it was reviewed and the Deputy Commissioner
of Customs, SVB, Seaport, Chennai in OIO No.14432/2011 dt. 4.2.2011 accepted
the declared price and the said order was valid for a period of 3 years upto
8.2.2014.
3\. Revenue reviewed the said DCs order dt.4.2.2011 and preferred appeal
before Commissioner (Appeals) on the grounds that adjudicating authority has
erred in accepting the declared price and also holding that royalty paid is
not a condition of sale of imported goods. Revenue also in their grounds of
appeal contended that royalty is addable in the imported goods under Rule 10
(1) (c) of Customs Valuation Rules, 2007. The LAA in his impugned order dt.
30.8.2013 upheld the OIO and rejected the Revenue's appeal. Hence the Revenue
filed the present appeal before Tribunal.
4\. The respondent filed writ petition before Honble High Court of Madras
seeking writ of mandamus and the Honble High Court in their order dated
9/12/2014 in Writ Petition No. 29902/2014 directed this Tribunal to proceed
with appeal independently without in any manner influenced by the pendency of
writ petition before Honble High Court. Hence this is taken up for disposal.
5\. Heard both sides.
6\. Ld. A.R reiterates the grounds of appeal filed by Revenue and submits that
from the beginning 1991 to 2008 the department has accepted the transaction
value and periodically renewed the said orders. While renewing the orders for
the period from 2011 to Feb'2014, there was a change in agreement by the
respondent for paying royalty as per their amendment to the agreement. She
drew our attention to page 17 at para 2 and findings at para-6 of the OIA and
submits that amendment of the royalty agreement was renewed prospectively and
the respondent did not inform that they paid royalty. She drew our attention
to page 28 of the OIO wherein adjudicating authority clearly held that on
examination of the balance sheet of the company for the year ended 2008-09 &
2009-10, flow back of money towards royalty was noticed. Adjudicating
authority confirmed payment of royalty however held that same cannot be added
to the import invoice on the ground that royalty payment is not a condition of
sale.
7\. Ld. A.R submits that after the issue of the order, the DRI initiated the
investigation on the related party transactions between the respondent and
M/s.3M USA and other related subsidiaries based on the specific intelligence
that the transactions were not at arms length and the investigation is yet to
complete. She submitted copy of DRI letter dt. 6.2.2014 and submits that DRI
could not finalize investigation as the respondents were not co-operative, not
submitted relevant agreements. She submits that SVB order has lapsed in
Feb'2014 and produced copy of letter dt. 15.7.2015 issued by CC-III Customs
House and submits that the delay of investigation is due to non-submission of
required details by the respondent and it was submitted only on 13.7.2015. DRI
is finalizing the investigation for issue of SCN.
8\. On the merits, she reiterated the grounds of appeal as at page 13 & 14 and
submits that flow back of money having established through receipt of royalty,
both adjudicating and the appellate authority have not considered the facts.
She relied the following case laws :-
(1) Matsushita Television & Audio India Ltd. Vs CC New Delhi 2001 (136) ELT
1093 (Tri.-Del.) (2) Matsushita Television & Audio (I) Ltd. Vs CC 2007 (211)
ELT 200 (SC) (3) Excel Production Audio Visuals P. Ltd. Vs Commissioner 2015
(321) ELT A49 (SC) She pleaded to set aside the orders and to remand the
matter to original authority in view of pending investigation.
9\. Learned Advocate representing the respondent submitted two written
synopsis and also copy of Profit & Loss Account, Annual Reports for the years
2008 to 2011 and the case laws and reiterated the same. She submits that both
the original authority and the Commissioner (Appeals) correctly held and given
their findings and rejected the Revenue appeal and reiterated the findings of
LAA and the adjudicating authority which is in their favour. She submits that
Revenue reviewed the DC order and filed appeal before Commissioner (Appeals).
The Commissioner (Appeals) has discussed in detail and examined all the
relevant clauses of the Intellectual Property Agreement including the Nature
of Royalty Clause 5.3 of the agreement and accepted the transaction as there
is no nexus between the royalty paid and the imported goods under Rule 10 (1)
(c) of CVR. She further explained in detail the relevant clause of agreement
dt. 1.7.2006 and referred to amendment to the IP Agreement dt. 1.7.2006. The
Recital of the agreement is given in clauses A, B, C, D and the definitions
has been recorded in Article I from para 1.1 onwards. She particularly
emphasized clause 1.20 which defines "Intellectual Property". She drew our
attention to clauses 1.31 (Software), 1.32 (User Documentation) and 1.33
(Development Documentation), though these are not relevant to respondent. On
the grounds of appeal of Revenue, she submits that there was a flow back of
royalty for the year 2008 and also for 2009-10 and for subsequent periods
which is discussed at page 7 (internal page 28) of the OIO. She submits that
as per clause 5.8 of the IP agreement, though there was a consideration,
royalty was provided under Article V i.e. 5.1 to 5.4. As per clause 5.8 of
Article V, she submits that their principal company viz. M/s.3M Company, USA
has waived its right to receive royalty payments and the termination of this
waiver shall constitute an amendment of this agreement. Ld. counsel submits
that as per this agreement there was no payment of royalty till 30.6.2009. She
further submits that there was an amendment to the said agreement which was
made on 16.12.2009 between the respondent and the principal company. She
submits that para 5.8 of the agreement was amended to the read "Agreement by
terminating the waiver w.e.f. 1.7.2009 and the respondent shall henceforth be
obligated to make royalty payments as per the terms of the agreement.' It is
made retrospectively from 1.7.2009 though the agreement was made on 16.12.2009
and thereafter they have paid the royalty. She submits that there was no
royalty payment made for the year 2008. In support of her contention, she
submitted Profit & Loss Account and Annual Reports of the company for the year
2008 to 2011 and drew our attention to page 48 of the P&L Account and the
Annual Report and submits that there is no mention of any royalty payment for
the year 2008. She drew our attention that adjudicating authority mentioned in
his order that there was flow back for the year 2008 onwards which is not
correct. In support of her plea, they have submitted a copy of Chartered
Accountant Certificate dt. 9.11.2015 reiterating the P&L for the year 2008 and
for the subsequent period and he has certified that the company has not made
any royalty payment to their parent company till 30.6.2009.
9.1. Ld. counsel further submits that after the termination of the waiver
agreement, they started paying royalty and submitted P&L Account for the
subsequent periods i.e. 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12 and also submitted an
Abstract and the worksheet showing the royalty payments for each year and
particularly for the year 2009 which clearly indicates royalty payments for
July-Sep 2009, Oct-Dec 2009 and also for the period January to March 2010
showing a total payment of Rs.5,15,63,747 for all the three quarters which is
as per the Profit & Loss Account indicated at page 52 of the Annual Report for
2009-10. The same worksheet was also provided for the subsequent periods. She
further submits that for all these royalty payments they have paid service tax
under reverse charge mechanism. She produced copy of invoice, T.R.6 challan
showing proof of payment of service tax and R&D Cess. She also drew our
attention to clause 5.3 of the agreement which was discussed by both the
adjudicating authority and the LAA. She therefore, submits that Commissioner
(Appeals) has correctly held that as per clause 5.3 which is annexed at page
26 of the agreement, clearly shows that as per sub-clause (a) of clause 5.3,
royalty payment is not a condition for sale and as per sub-clause (c), there
is no obligation for licensee to purchase any goods from licensor. She submits
that though there was no obligation, they are importing 80% from their
principal as well as from other related subsidiaries and 20% are purchased
from unrelated buyers like grinding wheels, abrasives, adhesive hypo resins
directly which are used in the manufacture of products for domestic and
export. She further submits that as per the agreement Software has been
clearly spelt out in Article III & IV but they have not imported any software
so far. Regarding the consideration/compensation and payment of royalties
referred to in clause 5.2 of the agreement specifying various percentages as
set forth in Appendix B which relates to marketing and production intangibles
for both domestic and export products. Intangibles are explained in the
definition at para 1.4.8 and 1.4.9.
9.2 Regarding case laws, she relied on the Supreme Court decision in the case
of CC Vs Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd.  2008 (224) ELT 23 (SC) and referred to
para-20 of the judgement wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court taking into account
the various clauses of the agreement has clearly held that there was no nexus
between the royalty payable for the knowhow and the goods imported for
manufacture of licensed products. She also relied on the following case laws
:-
(1) Wep Peripherals Ltd. Vs CC Chennai 2008 (224) ELT 30 (SC) (2) ABB Ltd. Vs
CC (Import) Mumbai 2013 (288) ELT 296 (Tri.-Mumbai) (3) Johnson & Johnson Ltd.
Vs CC Mumbai 2013 (292) ELT 111 (Tri.-Mumbai) (4) CC (Import) Mumbai Vs
Bridgestone India Pvt. Ltd.
2013 (92) ELT 403 (Tri.-Mumbai) (5) SGL Carbon India Pvt. Ltd. Vs CC (Impots)
Mumbai 2013 (290) ELT 723 (Tri.-Mumbai) (6) Foseco India Ltd. Vs Cc (Import)
Nhava Sheva 2014 (310) ELT 540 (Tri.-Mumbai)
10\. Ld. A.R in the rejoinder of the counter arguments of the learned counsel,
again referred to page 27, 28 of the OIO wherein no amendment of the agreement
has been discussed. She submits that the transaction is not at arms length.
For this very reason, the DRI is investigating the entire issue. She also
relied on the Supreme Court order relied by the respondent in the case of CC
Vs Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), particularly relied para-18 of the
judgement and submits that Supreme Court also said that if the department
finds that the importer/buyer has misled the department then the adjudicating
authority would be right in including the cost of royalty/licence fees payment
in the price of the imported goods. Ld. AR submits that in the present case
this very aspect is under investigation.
11\. Countering the argument of Ld. AR, the counsel submits that adjudicating
authority has investigated in detail before finalizing the renewal order dt.
4.2.2011. She drew our attention to page 5 (internal page 26) of the OIO to
show that documents, records submitted by the respondent were examined and
showed comparison of prices of same products exported out of US to other
subsidiaries including other related subsidiaries which is clearly brought out
in the OIO and concluded that the appellant followed uniform price policy.
12\. We have carefully considered the submissions of both sides and examined
the records and the Honble High Court of Madras Order dated 9.12.2014. The
issue for consideration in the Revenue Appeal is whether Commissioner
(Appeals) Order is legal and proper in rejecting the Department appeal and
upholding the Order-In-Original accepting the transaction value of imported
goods from the related buyers.
13\. This is the case of related party transactions and the Asst.
Commissioner, Special Valuation Branch in his renewal/review order dated
4.2.2011accepted the invoice price of the imports made from their related
foreign supplier for a further period of 3 years. The Department reviewed the
said order and preferred appeal before Commissioner (Appeals) on the identical
grounds as put forth in the present revenue appeal and the Lower Appellate
Authority rejected the Department appeal.
14\. On perusal of the impugned order dated 30.8.2013, we find that the Lower
Appellate Authority has not discussed the issue as to how the revenue's
contentions are not acceptable. Para.6 of his Order begins with his findings
and in the said para he merely reproduced the Tribunals Order of ABB Ltd.
cited by the respondents, and at Para 8, he concluded in view of the above
discussions and facts and legal position there is no infirmity in the
Assistant Commissioners order and rejected department's appeal. We do not see
any discussions either on facts or on legal issues in his impugned order. Para
3 to 5 is only the counter submissions of respondents and citations relied by
them. In the absence of any clear findings on each issues raised by the
Revenue, prima facie, we hold that the impugned order is not a speaking order
and on this ground alone the impugned order is liable to be set aside.
15\. Be that case, we now proceed to discuss the merits of the case. The fact
that the respondent is related subsidiary of 3M USA and its other subsidiaries
located across the world is not in dispute and the respondents started
importing 3M products since 1991, various products, capital goods, raw
materials, finished goods for manufacture of excisable goods or for trading.
On perusal of the respondent companys Annual Report 2008 submitted by them,
we find at page  7 it is stated that 3M a company of 75000 people with a
century old history produces / markets 50,000 products Globally and 5000
products for the Indian markets. As seen from the notes to accounts, Schedule
14 at Para 4 (pages 42,43, 44 of report) the quantitative information in
respect of goods Manufactured and Traded by the respondent company are listed
out as under :-
Manufactured Items :
1\. Self Adhesive Labels
2\. Epoxy Resin
3\. Paper and Paper Tapes
4\. Paint Polishes
5\. Abrasives
6\. Others (individually less than 10% of the total stock) Traded Items :
1\. Self Adhesive Labels
2\. Surgical and Dental Products
3\. Paint Polishes
4\. Abrasives
5\. Others (individually less than 10% of the total stock)
16\. As seen from para (9) of the Schedule 14 of the reports, the ratio of
imported and indigenous raw materials is 83% and 17% respectively and majority
of imports were sourced from their own related overseas suppliers and their
associated subsidiaries. It is pertinent to see from the said Annual Report
that their principal company 3M USA has more than 100 Related Fellow
Subsidiary companies located across the world for carrying out sale of 3M
products globally. The report also throws light on the foreign exchange
earnings on exports. It is seen that majority of exports were made only to
their own 3M Fellow Subsidiary companies (para-16 of report - Related party
transactions). The range of products imported by the respondent relates to
various sectors i.e. consumer goods, scrub pads, Health care products,
Engineering products, Office use items i.e. "post it" pads, Road safety signs,
graphics etc. This shows that the 3M USA controls the rights of 50,000
products, through its related subsidiaries and the transactions are within 3M
Group.
17\. Considering the above background of facts and the range of products vis-
a-vis their relationship with principal company ie. 3M USA and their
associated subsidiaries across the world, we examine the issue of whether the
original authority & LAA are correct in accepting the declared price and
holding the Royalty payment not includible in the value of imported goods and
whether the transactions are at arms length or otherwise.
18\. The main crux of the document is the 'Tripartite' IPR Agreement signed by
the respondents 3M India Ltd. with 3M Company (USA)and 3M Innovative
Properties Company (3M IPC) (USA) its effective date being 1.7.2006." On
perusal of the copy of the said agreement produced by the respondent, we find
the said agreement does not even indicate the actual date of signing of the
agreement by the parties which is normally shown in any agreement. [with a
phrase: on this ____ day of the ______ month of the ____year]. Even the
signature of the signatories do not show the date. Only the "Stamp paper"
issued by Govt. of Karnataka reveals the date of issue as "16.1.2006" and we
can only presume that the said agreement was signed after the date or later.
19\. The scope of the Intellectual Property Agreement are set out in various
clauses at Recitals clause A to clause G, in Article II various definitions,
Rights and Obligations between the licencee and the licensor. Article III-
Software, Article IV- Organization Changes to the Worldwide 3M Corporate
Family, Article V - Compensation (consideration)  Article VI - Disclosure and
Use of Proprietary Information, Article VII Infringement of I.P. Article VIII
Term, Termination, Default and Survival Article IX  Miscellaneous.
20\. The scope and the relevant extracts of the various Articles are
reproduced as under :-
A. 3M is an innovative multinational company with its headquarters in the
United States and affiliates in more than 60 countries around the world.
Collectively referred to as the worldwide 3M corporate family, 3M and its
affiliates sell 3M products in more than 180 countries. 3M manages the
worldwide 3M corporate family on a global basis to maximize the overall
benefit to that corporate family, and thus to shareholders of 3M. 3M has a
long and established history of developing new and proprietary technologies,
products and services, most of which are based on one or more technology
platforms that have been developed by 3M following many years of investment in
research and development. These technologies, products and services are
continuously provided to the worldwide 3M corporate family under agreements
similar to this Agreement.
B. 3M IPC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 3M. 3M IPC owns or is exclusively
licensed under an international portfolio of intellectual property rights that
provide the worldwide 3 M corporate family with a substantial competitive
advantage in manufacturing and selling products, and providing services,
around the world. 3M IPC continuously obtains new intellectual property rights
from 3M, other members of the worldwide 3M Corporate family, and third
parties, and licenses those intellectual property rights to 3M, other members
of the worldwide 3M corporate family, and third parties in exchange for
royalties or other consideration. In this manner, 3M IPC coordinates the
transfer and the management of these intellectual property rights around the
world for the benefit of the worldwide 3M corporate family.
C. Affiliate is one member of the worldwide 3M corporate family. 3M and 3M IPC
make and are willing to continue to make new technologies, products and
services available to Affiliate on a continuous basis. 3M IPC is also willing
to license intellectual property rights controlling by it to Affiliate to
enable Affiliate to conduct and expand its business. Accordingly, the
intellectual property rights licensed hereunder will enable Affiliate to
conduct manufacturing operations and other general business operations
normally conducted by members of the worldwide 3M corporate family.
D. 3M and Affiliate may have decided, or may decide, that it is in their best
interest and in the best interest of the worldwide 3M corporate family or
Affiliate to manufacture certain 3M products. To protect Affiliates
investment in its manufacturing operations 3M IPC is willing to grant, and
Affiliate wishes to obtain, a license to manufacture products and/or have
products manufactured for it by third parties. Affiliate also requires the
ability to conduct its business in a manner that is consistent with the rest
of the worldwide 3M corporate family and appropriate to the principal country
in which Affiliate is located. To protect Affiliates investment in its
general business operations, 3M IPC is willing to grant, and Affiliate wishes
to obtain, a license to conduct such operations. 3M and 3M IPC support
Affiliates manufacturing and other general business operations by constantly
expanding and refreshing the portfolio of intellectual property rights that
are provided to Affiliate. In this manner, Affiliate will continue to receive
3Ms most current developments, information, research, systems and techniques
as they relate to 3Ms administrative, engineering, information technology,
laboratory, management, manufacturing, marketing, selling and other functions.
E. The global economy is continuously changing, and the operations of and the
relationships among the individual members of the worldwide 3M corporate
family must change accordingly. Consequently, 3M wishes to create and acquire
new affiliates, modify its organizational structure as needed, minimize
barriers between its affiliates in different countries, and enable its
affiliates to grow and evolve in response to local and global business
demands. To facilitate the transfer of technologies, products, services and
intellectual property rights among the members of the worldwide 3M corporate
family. 3M, 3M IPC, and Affiliate therefore wish to enter into this Agreement.
This Agreement provides for the transfer of technologies, products and
services, and for the licensing of intellectual property rights from 3M and 3M
IPC to Affiliate. Other agreements among 3M, 3M IPC and Affiliate provide for
the transfer to 3M and 3M IPC of intellectual property rights developed or
obtained by Affiliate on behalf of 3M and 3M IPC. This enables these rights to
be subsequently made available by 3M IPC to the worldwide 3M corporate family
and to third parties, as appropriate. Because 3M IPC also receives
intellectual property rights from other affiliated companies in the worldwide
3M corporate family and from third parties, Affiliate will continuously
benefit from the creative efforts of those affiliates companies and third
parties, and those affiliates companies will benefit from the corresponding
efforts of Affiliate.
F. Instead of negotiating separate license agreements for different
technologies, products, services and intellectual property rights, the Parties
wish to negotiate a single agreement that will grant a license to Affiliate
under the entire portfolio of 3M IPCs intellectual property rights. The
compensation to be paid under this Agreement takes into account the licenses
received by Affiliate under the intellectual property rights of 3M IPC, that
3M IPC is responsible for managing these intellectual property rights, and the
royalties received by 3M IPC from Affiliate. The compensation to be paid also
takes into account other agreements among 3M, 3M IPC and Affiliate relating to
intellectual property rights developed or obtained by Affiliate on behalf of
3M and 3M IPC and then transferred to 3M IPC, as well as the reimbursement
received by Affiliate from 3M for certain laboratory work that Affiliate
undertakes pursuant to these other agreements. In total, fair compensation
will be paid by the Parties in exchange for the benefits that each receives
under this Agreement and the other agreements.
G. 3M, 3M IPC and Affiliate operate as separate companies. The Parties
understand, however, that 3M IPC and Affiliate are controlled by 3M, and thus
are members of the worldwide 3M corporate family. As such, the Parties intend
that this Agreement further the interests of the worldwide 3M corporate
family, and in all cases do no harm to those interests ......

5.3 Nature of Royalties
(a) The royalties payable to 3M IPC hereunder are not a condition for the sale
of any product from Licensor to Licensee.
(b) The royalties payable to 3M IPC hereunder do not compensate Licensor for
any Licensor Intellectual Property that is inherent in any product sold by
Licensor or 3M Related Company to Licensee (including, but not limited to,
Licensor Trademarks applied to that product by Licensor or a 3M Related
Company), the compensation for which shall be reflected in the purchase price
of that product.
(c) There is no obligation hereunder for Licensee to purchase any goods from
Licensor.
5.4 Royalty Payments. All royalty payments due hereunder shall be made by
Licensee monthly not later than the last day of the succeeding month, or such
other schedule as may be agreed to by the Parties. Paragraph 9.8
notwithstanding, the payments are subject to the applicable financial
regulations of the Primary Territory. The payments shall be made or credited
to the account of 3M IPC, or made in such other manner as may be directed by
3M IPC. If Licensee does not make any royalty payment due hereunder 3M IPC
may, in its sole discretion, waive its right to receive any such royalty
payment or defer its receipt of any such royalty payment (with or without
interest).
... ... ....
5.8 Waiver. Licensor waives its right to receive royalty payments and royalty
reports pursuant to Paragraphs 5.2 to 5.5 and termination of this waiver shall
constitute an amendment of this Agreement under Paragraph 9.2.
As seen from the scope of the agreement, the agreement is effective from
1.7.2006. 3M Company, U.S.A, which is a principal company through their
affiliates sell their products in more than 180 countries and it manages and
controls worldwide 3M corporate family on global basis. Whereas 3M IPC (USA)
is wholly owned subsidiary of 3M who co-ordinates the transfer and management
of I.P.R rights around the world for the benefit of 3M family.
21\. As set out in recitals at clause (A) to (G) of the agreement, both 3M
company, U.S.A and 3M IPC, grant licence IPR rights to the affiliate companies
to conduct and expand its business. As set out in clause (E) of the Agreement
, 3M USA, and 3M IPC (USA) and the respondent-company entered this agreement
for transfer of technologies, products and services, and for the licensing of
Intellectual Property Rights for 3M, 3M IPC (USA) to the respondent. Clause
(F) of the agreement explains that instead of negotiating separate licence
agreements for different technologies, products, services and I.P.R rights
they decided to negotiate a single agreement that will grant licence to the
respondent under entire portfolio of 3M IPCs Intellectual Property Rights.
Clause (G) of the agreement while stating that though 3M and 3M IPC (USA) and
the respondent operate as separate companies, it clearly stipulates that 3M,
IPC and the respondents are controlled by 3M and thus or members of the
worldwide 3M corporate family. This negates their very first sentence on
independency. Under Article III of the said agreement, the licensor also
grants rights to use of software as set out in the said article.
22\. As a consideration for I.P.R. for the licence granted to the respondent,
under Article II & Article III, the consideration of payment has been termed
as Compensation which is set out above in clause 5.2 of the agreement and
the percentage of consideration for each category has been specified of 5%,
8%, 1% etc. It is pertinent to refer Para 5.8 of the Article V of the
agreement wherein the licensor waived his right to receive the royalty
payments. Subsequently, amendment to the above agreement was signed on
16.12.2009 between the overseas companies and the respondent where they have
terminated the waiver of payment of royalty by amending the paragraph 5.8 of
the agreement to read as under :
Amendment to the Intellectual Property Agreement Effective July 1, 2006 This
agreement is made as of December 16, 2009 by and among 3M Company, a Delaware
corporation having a principal place of business at 3M Center, St. Paul,
Minnesota US.A ("3M"), 3M Innovative Properties Company, a Delaware
corporation having is place of business at 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota,
U.S.A. ("3M IPC"), and 3M India Limited, a corporation organized under the
laws of India having a registered office at Plot Nos. 48-51, Electronics City,
Hosur Road, Bangalore  560 100, India ("Affiliate") Recitals A. 3M Innovative
Properties Company, 3M Company and 3M India Limited entered into an
intellectual Property Agreement effective July 1, 2006 (the "Agreement").
B. Under Paragraph 5.8 of the Agreement, Licensor (3M Company and 3M
Innovative Properties Company) waived its right to receive royalty payments
and royalty reports for the period July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2009, pursuant to
Paragraphs 5.2 to 5.5 of the Agreement.
C. 3M Innovative Properties Company, 3M Company and 3M India Limited (the
"Parties") have agreed that waiver should be terminated.
D. 3M Company and 3m Innovative Properties Company are now wanting to
reinstate the payment of royalty by 3M India Limited as per the provisions of
Paragraph 5.2 In consideration of these premises, and of the mutual premises
made by the Parties herein, the Parties agree as follows :-
1\. This letter agreement hereby amends Paragraph 5.8 of the Agreement by
terminating the waiver effective July 1, 2009. With effect from July 1,2009,
Affiliate shall henceforth be obligated to make royalty payments as per the
terms of the Agreement.
2\. Any obligation to provide royalty reports that arose after July 1, 2009
and before the date first appearing above shall be satisfied by delivery of a
single royalty report within sixty (60) days of the date of this agreement.
3\. Any obligation to pay royalties that arose after July 1, 2009 and before
the date of first appearing above shall be satisfied by payment of such
royalties within sixty (60) days of the date of this agreement.
4\. All other terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain the same.
The parties hereto have caused this agreement to be executed in triplicate
each of which shall be considered an original, as of the date first appearing
above.
By virtue of the amendment of the said I.P.R Agreement made on 16th December
2009, royalty is payable with effect from 1.7.2009. On perusal of the original
order passed by AC, SVB and the impugned order, the original authority in his
order mentioned this royalty payment. It is pertinent to see that the
department has renewed the SVB order accepting the transaction value imported
from parent company and from their subsidiaries and associates vide order dt.
8.2.2008. It is seen that though the respondents were importing and carrying
out the business transaction with the principle companies from 1991, the I.P.R
agreement referred above which was signed by the 3 parties in 2006 comes into
effect 1.7.2006. Whereas we find the respondent has informed the department on
16.6.2010 i.e. after a lapse of nearly 4 years. We find from the adjudication
order, there was also an another agreement titled Supports Service Agreement
entered on 18.12.2009 with a separate royalty payment. The I.P.R Agreement
signed with effect from 1.7.2006, which is the Master Agreement on licensing
the products, know how, software etc. The purpose of the said agreement is to
license the knowhow and the products to the respondent and the consideration
is the Royalty payment as set out at Clause 5.2. It is pertinent to see the
Clause 5.2 of Article V of the said Intellectual Property Agreement the word
used in para 5 (a) to 5 (f) is In partial consideration for the rights
received or In partial consideration for the licensee's use of production
intangibles etc. Normally when any agreement is entered to grant licenses to
Intellectual Property Rights to the user, this consideration of payment is
full consideration for the transfer of know how etc. whereas the percentage of
royalty payment set out in Clause 5.2 is only a partial consideration which
means that there is something more to it. This itself raises serious doubt on
the transactions which are not at arms length.
23\. Further, it is seen that, having set out the payment of Royalty at Clause
5.2, the same agreement at Clause 5.8 says that the Licensor waives its rights
to receive the Royalty payment from the respondent company. If the overseas
company wants to waive Royalty payment from respondent, it raises serious
questions why the IPR agreement was signed with effect from 1.7.2006 under the
terms and conditions of rights and liabilities and considerations made between
the related parties. This indicates that there is a special consideration and
the transactions are not at arms length as claimed by the respondents.
24\. Further, it is pertinent to state that while terminating the waiver of
royalty payment on 16.12.2009 by amendment to the original agreement, the
payment of royalty takes effect only from 1.7.2009 and not from 1.7.2006 when
the original agreement came into effect. If the transactions are at arms
length and when the parties decided to make royalty payments either it should
be from the date of termination i.e. 16.12.2009 or from the original effective
date of agreement dt.1.7.2006, whereas we find that the payments of royalty
was made retrospectively only from 1.7.2009. All these facts establishes that
the entire related party transactions are not at arms length or on principal
to principal basis. This clearly shows that the principal company is
compensated indirectly or directly in some other means either by way of
pricing of the goods or other method of payments or the principal company
absorbs the royalty payments by adjustment which can be brought out only in
detailed investigation.
25\. Further, we also find that the original agreement effective from 1.7.2006
also grants rights to the respondent for use of software licence of various
softwares for which consideration has also been set out at para 5.2. Whereas
the respondent states that the software licence agreement is not relevant to
them. This also raises a serious doubt on the respondents claim, on the one
side they have entered into an agreement on 1.7.2006 but claims that it is not
relevant. If that be the case, the very purpose of entering into agreement,
with effect from 1.7.2006 has no meaning. Even the termination of waiver
agreement made on 16.12.2009 also covers payments towards electronic office
software, health care software etc. and the payment of royalty starts w.e.f.
1.7.2009. All these aspects have not been examined either by the original
authority or by L.A.A.
26\. On perusal of a copy of the letter 6.2.2014 (F.No.S/IV/34/2012/BZU)
signed by ADG, DRI Bangalore and letter dt. 15.7.2015 signed by Commissioner
of Customs, III, Custom House, Chennai, the DRI initiated investigations
against respondent company based on specific intelligence and based on the
preliminary investigations, it is stated that respondent has suppressed
certain vital information regarding pricing adopted for inter-company billings
and their applications made before SVB Chennai and Bangalore. The very nature
of agreement as discussed in the preceding paragraphs supports our view that
the detailed investigations of transactions between the related parties will
throw light which is not done by the Lower Appellate Authority.
27\. Considering the above facts, we hold that neither the original authority
nor the lower appellate authority has considered the intricacies of the
agreements and the subsequent amendment agreements, billing and pricing
patterns. Instead, merely relied on this Tribunals decision of ABB Ltd.
(supra). It is pertinent to see that the Tribunal in the above judgement
relied on Honble Supreme Court's decision of Ferodo India Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
and the Apex Court held at para 18 that if on examination of the pricing
agreement in juxtaposition in EAA and if the department proves that the
importers/buyer has misled the department by adjusting the price of the
imported item in the guise of increased royalty/licence, then the adjudicating
authority would be right in including the cost of royalty/licence fees paid in
the price of the imported goods. This ruling of the Apex Court has been
overlooked by the lower authorities. We find that the investigation
proceedings already initiated by the D.R.I is on this very aspect.
28\. In view of the above facts, we hold that both the original authority and
the L.A.A. have not examined in detail, viz. agreements, amendment agreements
but merely endorses the respondents view without any discussion. Therefore,
there is enough justification on the Revenues contention and the Order-in-
Original and the impugned order are liable to be set aside and to be remanded
to the original authority.
29\. Notwithstanding our findings recorded at preceding paragraphs, we are
obliged to put our observations on the respondents anxiety to implement the
order dt. 30.8.2013 of Commissioner (Appeals).
(i) Importer-respondent filed a writ petition against the impugned order in
W.P.No.2887/2014 wherein they sought direction from Hon'ble Madras High Court
to the Deputy Commissioner of Customs to comply with the OIO dt.4.2.2011 as
confirmed in OIA dt. 30.8.2013. The Hon'ble High Court, Madras in their
interim order dt.7.4.2014 granted interim injunction against deposit of 1% EDD
with condition that the importer to furnish a bank guarantee for Rs.10 crores
till the disposal of writ petition. The said writ petition is still pending.
(ii) Importer filed second W.P.No.3565/2014 before Hon'ble High Court of
Madras seeking to transfer the entire case to DC (SVB) Bangalore Customs, Air
Cargo and to finalise the assessments as per OIO of DC SVB Chennai & OIA of
Commissioner (Appeals) Chennai. This writ petition is still pending before the
High Court.
(iii) Not satisfied with the above, the respondent again filed the third writ
petition before the High Court of Madras in W.P.No.29902/2014 seeking for
issue of writ of mandamus to this Tribunal to decide the Revenue's appeal. The
Hon'ble High Court in their final order dt. 9.12.2014 directed this Tribunal
to proceed with appeal independently without in any manner being influenced by
the pendency of writ petition before High Court.
(iv) It is interesting to note that since 1991 the importer's transactions
were accepted as per invoice price and all the orders in the past from 1991
till the last order dt. 4.2.2011 are in favour of importer-respondent and the
Revenue appeal before Commissioner (Appeals) was also rejected and OIO was
upheld by LAA and the entire proceedings were in favour of the assessee. Under
normal circumstances when both OIO and OIA was in favour of the respondent, it
is the Revenue who is aggrieved by the original order & LAA's order, ought to
have sought any remedy before Higher Judicial Forum.
(v) The above acts of respondent to implement the OIO dt. 4.2.2011 and
impugned OIA dt. 30.8.2013 and also to see the Revenue appeal before Tribunal
get disposed immediately in spite of two of their writ petitions still pending
before the High Court is something more than meets the eye. Is it that the
respondent worried that certain vital intelligence and data are secured by the
investigation officers of DRI who are investigating the case on all India
basis against respondent's transactions with related persons 3M, 3M IPC &
other subsidiaries or is it they are anxious that DRI investigation will prove
against their related party transaction or something else which is best known
to the respondents. All these lead to raise serious doubt about the
transactions shown on paper between respondent and their related 3M & 3M IPC &
subsidiaries, are not normal transaction but special consideration which is
being currently probed/investigated by DRI. What is expressed in this para-29
above is purely our personal views based on the events and circumstances
presented before us.
30\. In view of the foregoing discussions and our findings as above, we set
aside both the Order-in-Original and the impugned order-in-appeal and remand
the matter to the original authority with a direction to examine the issue
afresh in the light of our findings contained in this order and to proceed to
determine the issue. The original authority is also directed to take into
consideration the outcome of the investigation proceedings initiated by D.R.I
while deciding the issue.
31\. In the result, the Revenue appeal is allowed by way of remand in the
above terms. Stay application filed by Revenue also gets disposed. This order
is subject to the outcome of two writ petitions pending before the Hon'ble
High Court of Madras.

2\. The brief facts of the case are that respondents M/s.3M India Ltd.,
Bangalore imported capital goods, raw materials, finished products from their
principal company M/s.3M USA and their related subsidiaries located in other
countries. Since the respondent and the supplier are related, the issue was
dealt with by Special Valuation Branch by issue of Circular No.138/91

the declared price and the said order was valid for a period of 3 years upto
8.2.2014.
3\. Revenue reviewed the said DCs order dt.4.2.2011 and preferred appeal
before Commissioner (Appeals) on the grounds that adjudicating authority has
erred in accepting the declared price and also holding that royalty paid is
not a condition of sale of imported goods. Revenue also in their grounds of
appeal contended that royalty is addable in the imported goods under Rule 10
