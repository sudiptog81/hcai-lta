    Case :- TRADE TAX REVISION DEFECTIVE No. - 57 of 2019
    Revisionist :- M/S Ojas Industries Private Limited Thru. Ashok Kr. Pandey
    Opposite Party :- Commissioner, U.P. Goods & Service Tax, Lucknow & Ors.
    Counsel for Revisionist :- Dileep Singh
    Counsel for Opposite Party :- C.S.C.
    Hon'ble Mrs. Sangeeta Chandra,J.
1\. This trade tax revision was filed by the Revisionist-Company against the
order dated 22.2.2019 passed by the Commercial Tax Tribunal in Second Appeal
no.217/2018 by which it has rejected the Second Appeal of the Revisionist
against the order dated 25.9.2018 passed by the Additional Commissioner in
First Appeal no.512/2018 and thus affirmed the order dated 16.4.2018 passed by
the Assessing Authority for Assessment Year 2016-17.
2\. There was some delay in filing the Revision which has been condoned by
Tax Returns were rejected by the Department on merger of the transferor and
transferee Company. The Supreme Court relied upon its observations in Marshall
Sons and Company (India) Ltd. vs. ITO (1997) 2 SCC 302 to observe that
pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation, the assessment of the
transferee Company must take into account the income of both the transferor
and transferee Companies. It was observed that filing of revised returns by
the transferee Company was not because of any omission or wrong statement
contained in the original returns but because delay occurred on account of
time taken to obtain sanction of the Scheme of Amalgamation. In the present
case the predecessor Company/transferor Company have been succeeded by the
Revisionist/transferee Company who had taken over its business along with
assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc. The stock transferred as a result
of amalgamation was not a sale requiring issuance of certificate by M/s.
Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. in favour of the Revisionist as per the Exemption
Notification of 2016.
35\. The questions on which the Revision was initially admitted are answered
2\. There was some delay in filing the Revision which has been condoned by
this Court by detailed order on 13.11.2019. The Revision was admitted by this
Court's order dated 20.11.2019 on three questions of law framed by it.
3\. Heard Sri Manish Singh and Sri Dileep Singh for the Revisionist and Sri
Rohit Nandan Shukla for the State respondents.
4\. This case relates not to any alleged avoidance of tax or imposition of
Penalty but to the refusal of Assessing Officer to accept the application
dated 27.2.2018 filed by the Revisionist praying for issuance of Form D to be
utilized by it for benefit of claiming Tax Exemption as per notification
issued by the Government dated 3.3.2016. Form D is the prescribed form issued
under sub section 3A of Section 4 of U.P. Tax on Entry of Goods into Local
Area Act, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act 2007') read with sub-rule
1 of Rule 5 of U.P. Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Area Rules, 2008
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules of 2008').
5\. Under Section 4 of U.P. Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Area Act, 2007,
the State is entitled to levy and realise a tax on entry of goods specified in
the Schedule into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein, from any
place out of the local area at such rate not exceeding 5% of value of goods as
specified by the State Government by notification. Different rates may be
specified in respect of different goods or different class of goods. The State
Government may by notification amend the Schedule and also by notification
exempt certain goods from levy of Entry Tax.
6\. Under Rule 5(1) of the Rules of 2008, a declaration regarding proof of
payment of tax referred to in sub section 3A of Section 4 of the Act shall be
made in Form D, and the same Form D shall be utilized also for the purpose of
claiming exemption from payment of Entry Tax. The State Government by a
notification no. KA.NI.-2-320/XI-9(81)/97-U.P.Act-30-07-Order-(152)-2016 dated
3.3.2016 (hereinafter referred to as exemption notification dated 3.3.2016)
has exempted sugar manufactured during Crushing Season 2015-16 by a Sugar Mill
established in U.P. from levy of Entry Tax subject to following conditions:
(i) The manufacturer Sugar Mill shall issue a certificate prescribed by the
Commissioner Commercial Taxes to the purchasing dealer that the sugar sold has
been manufactured during the Crushing Season 2015-16 and as such it is exempt
from the levy of tax;
(ii) The purchasing dealer shall not pay tax on such sugar to the above
manufacturer;
(iii) The purchasing dealer shall issue prescribed declaration as envisaged in
sub-rule (1) of rule 5 of Rules of 2008 to the subsequent purchaser, if any,
who intends to bring such sugar in a different local area in respect of the
sugar purchased against the aforesaid certificate issued by the Sugar Mill to
ensure that no Entry Tax is payable at any subsequent stage.
7\. This exemption notification has been issued in continuance of earlier
exemption notification for sugar Crushing Season 2013-14 dated 10.1.2014. It
also provided a similar condition for issuance of Form K as proof of
manufacturing year of sugar on which exemption from Entry Tax was claimed by
the assessee. Form K is issued by manufacturing Sugar Mill as certificate to
the dealer that sugar sold has been manufactured during Crushing Season
mentioned in the exemption notification and as such, it is exempted from levy
of Entry Tax.
8\. The format for issuance of Form K was released by the State Government by
notification dated 16.1.2014. The same Form K which was issued in pursuance of
notifications dated 10.1.2014 and 16.1.2014 has been continued for providing
exemption from payment of Entry Tax for sugar produced during Crushing Season
2015-16.
9\. It is the case of Revisionist that it deals with sale and purchase of
sugar and Form D is required to be issued to it by its buyers as proof of fact
that sugar that is being sold by the Revisionist is exempted from payment of
Entry Tax and no Entry Tax has been levied on such sugar. The Revisionist
being trader of cane sugar had acquired entire business of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar
Ltd. which company merged into Revisionist's Company under Amalgamation Scheme
approved by the High Court of Delhi by order dated 26.2.2016 in Company
Petition No.631/2015.
10\. Under Sections 391 and 394 of Indian Companies Act, a scheme was
formulated for amalgamation of several companies including M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar
Ltd. into Revisionist's Company, as a result of which the entire undertaking
including properties, rights and powers of the transferor Company stood
transferred to the Revisionist. Details of the Scheme of Amalgamation were
mentioned in the order of Delhi High Court dated 26.2.2016, relevant
paragraphs of which are being quoted hereinbelow:
"15. To be noted, the scheme in clause 4.2(k) provides that all employees of
transferor companies, in service on the effective date, shall become the
employees of the transferee company, on such date without any break or
interruption in service and on terms and conditions as to remuneration not
less favorable than those subsisting with reference to the transferor
companies, as on the said date.
16\. In terms of the provisions of Section 391 and 394 of the Act, and in
terms of the scheme the entire undertaking, properties, rights and powers of
the transferor companies, will stand transferred to and/or vest in transferee
company, without any further act or deed. Similarly, in terms of the scheme,
all liabilities and duties of the transferor companies shall stand transferred
to transferee company, without any further act or deed.
17\. Furthermore, as per clause 4.12 of the scheme, the transferor companies
shall stand dissolved without being wound up."
11\. It is case of Revisionist that M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. was also engaged
in purchase and sale of cane sugar from M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill and
other Sugar Mills and as per the Scheme of Amalgamation, all remaining stock
of sugar purchased by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. for the Crushing Season 2015-16
was transferred to Revisionist on the amalgamation coming into effect. Such
sugar stock was exempted from Entry Tax as M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill had
issued Form K as prescribed by exemption notification issued by the department
certifying that the sugar which was produced for the Crushing Season 2015-16
had been sold to M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. without charging any entry tax.
12\. The Revisionist having acquired all leftover sugar stock of transferor
Company needed to further sell the stock of sugar so acquired to other dealers
both within State of U.P. and outside State of U.P. The Revisionist for
issuing such certificate as required under Exemption Notification of 2016
requested the Assessing Officer for issuance of blank Form D under the Rules
of 2008 as dealers to which such sugar stock was to be sold had to be given
such Form D, which were to be shown by such subsequent purchasers along with
tax invoices to their respective Assessing Officers for finalizing individual
annual assessment. The final assessment of these subsequent purchasers being
already in process, the application was submitted on 27.2.2018 for 3,32,969
quintals of sugar acquired by the Revisionist-Company on 1.4.2016, in terms of
amalgamation order dated 26.2.2016 passed by the High Court of Delhi. The
Revisionist had sold 1,19,707 quintals of sugar valued at Rs.42,67,60,351 to
several traders in State of U.P. and 2,13,262 quintals of sugar valued at
Rs.77,20,26,314/- to dealers outside of State of U.P.
13\. The Assessing Authority rejected the application of Revisionist dated
27.2.2018 on the ground that Revisionist could not prove that sugar it had
acquired from M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. had been the exempted sugar stock for
Crushing Season 2015-16 under Exemption Notification of 2016.
14\. It has been submitted by the learned counsel for Revisionist that all
copies of Form K issued online by the department have been filed along with
Application for Interim Relief filed in this Revision. Form K issued in favour
of original trader M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. clearly showed that amount of
sugar for which Form K was issued i.e. 10,53,928 quintals. The bills raised by
M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill for sale of such sugar to M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar
Ltd. have been also filed before this Court and were also filed before the
Assessing Authority at the time of consideration of Revisionist's application
for issuance of blank Form D. For some quantity of sugar sold by M/s. Ritesh
Vyaapar Ltd. before its merger with the Revisionist, M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd.
had asked the Department to issue Form D, which has been issued, but 3,32,969
quintals of sugar was leftover for the year 2015-16, which stood transferred
along with other assets of Company on its merger with the Revisionist on
1.4.2016. It was for this leftover stock that the Revisionist had made the
application dated 27.2.2018 along with copy of order of High Court of Delhi
dated 26.2.2016. The Assessing Officer clearly could not understand the
meaning of merger/amalgamation and treated the Revisionist as subsequent
purchaser of sugar stock of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. and in his order
rejecting such application, referred to the fact that petitioner could not
produce any documentary proof/certificate issued by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd.
in its favour while transferring the sugar stock as was the prerequisite
condition under exemption notification of 2016.
15\. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Assessing Authority dated 16.4.2018,
a First Appeal was filed which was also rejected summarily by stating very
same reason, as mentioned in the order of Deputy Commissioner/Assessing
Authority. The Revisionist being aggrieved, filed a Second Appeal which has
been rejected by the Tribunal. Hence this Revision has been filed.
16\. Counsel for Revisionist has pointed out from annexures to this Revision,
annexure-9 at page-94 where Form K issued in favour of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar
Ltd. by the Department for the year 2015-16 has been filed which clearly
mention the manufacture/seller as M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill, and
purchaser/dealer as M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. The details of Form K for the
year 2015-16 show total quantity in quintals of sugar purchased by M/s. Ritesh
Vyaapar Ltd. and total value of such sugar.
17\. Sri Manish Singh has also argued that a Show Cause Notice was issued for
finalizing assessment of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. by the Assessing Officer and
final order was passed on 16.5.2019 copy of which, has been filed as
annexure-13 to the paper book, which clearly shows that Assessing Officer was
aware of High Court of Delhi's order dated 26.2.2016 and merger of M/s. Ritesh
Vyaapar Ltd. with Revisionist and transferor Company ceasing to exist
thereafter. It was pointed out that on internal page 2 of Assessment order,
there is clear mention of transfer of stock of leftover sugar for the year
2015-16. It mentioned leftover/remaining stock as 3,32,969 quintals. It was
same quantity of leftover stock for which Revisionist has requested the
Assessing Officer to issue Form D which would then have been filled up by it
and later on, issued to subsequent 360 traders/dealers to whom such sugar
stock was sold by the Revisionist.
18\. It has been submitted that while noting the argument raised by the
Appellant, the Tribunal failed to take into account the fact that merger and
transfer of stock as a result of amalgamation order of High Court was not in
fact purchase of such sugar stock. The Tribunal has while rejecting the Second
Appeal referred to two reasons to come to its conclusion. Firstly, transfer of
stock had not been done on 1.4.2016 but before that date and it amounted to
the Revisionist becoming a subsequent purchaser and initial purchaser M/s.
Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. had failed to issue any certificate as per exemption
notification of 2016 in favour of revisionist, secondly it observed that the
appellant had failed to prove that sugar stock which was transferred before
1.4.2016 was of that sugar which was manufactured during Crushing Season
2015-16 and not of any other previous year.
19\. It has been submitted that first reason mentioned for rejection of Second
Appeal by Tribunal has resulted from a very clear misunderstanding of
Amalgamation Scheme and the order of the High Court dated 26.2.2016 and the
second reason for rejection of Second Appeal cannot also be sustained because
sugar being a perishable edible commodity all sugar stock that is manufactured
is stamped with specific manufacturing date mentioned on packaging. Bajaj
Hindustan Sugar Mill had issued sale certificate in terms of Exemption
Notification and then Form K was issued to M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. and the
stock was checked and certificate produced was for Crushing Season 2015-16.
20\. Counsel for Revisionist has argued that the Revisionist is facing great
difficulty as some of stock of sugar transferred to it by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar
Ltd. has in fact been sold by Revisionist to 360 dealers. This sugar was
manufactured during the year 2015-16 and hence exempted from levy of Entry Tax
but it could not be certified by Revisionist to be so exempted under the
exemption notification of 2016. Form D in respect of sugar having not been
issued, the Assessing Officers of respective Regions may take coercive action
against the dealers to whom such sugar is sold, as a result, all dealers have
been approaching the Revisionist repeatedly for providing Form D and failure
of Revisionist to give Form D to its dealers, may lead to further legal
complications for the Company.
21\. Sri Rohit Nandan Shukla, learned Standing Counsel for State respondents
has argued that supplementary affidavit filed by Revisionist on 1.10.2020
cannot be relied upon by Revisionist as it does not disclose amount of closing
stock. The Assessment order dated 25.3.2019 for Assessment Year 2015-16 issued
by Assessing Authority for M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. does not mention closing
stock but only mentions deposit of Form K and that the Assessing Officer had
failed to find any adverse material on record against the dealer M/s. Ritesh
Vyaapar Ltd.
22\. Learned Standing Counsel has also pointed out from operative portion of
order of the Tribunal that no certificate or documentary evidence was filed by
the Revisionist before the Assessing Officer to claim that such sugar was
actually produced during Crushing Season 2015-16 and had been certified to be
so produced by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. He has also argued that from perusal
of order of Second Appeal it appears that High Court of Delhi's order was not
produced by the Revisionist before the Assessment Officer and the Additional
Commissioner, Appeals and therefore Revisionist cannot now rely upon the
Amalgamation Order in Second Appeal which argument was not pressed before the
Assessment Officer and the Additional Commissioner, Appeals.
23\. Sri Manish Singh in rejoinder has submitted that from perusal of SA-1 and
SA-2 dated 25.3.2019 and 22.10.2019 respectively, it is clear that Assessment
Officer has mentioned in Para 3, the purchase of sugar amounting to
Rs.3,28,54,20,634/- as mentioned at Serial no.2 having been bought by M/s.
Ritesh Vyaapar from M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill and the the leftover stock
has also been mentioned with value of Rs.105,75,54,980/-. Since it is on a
printed Form issued by the Department itself, it does not refer to the
quantity of remaining stock, but only refers to the value of such stock. The
value mentioned in Para 4 of such order is same value of remaining stock of
sugar for which Form D was prayed for from the department, and for which Form
K was submitted by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. before the Assessing Officer and
which was accepted by the Assessing Officer in his orders dated 25.3.2019 and
22.10.2019.
24\. This Court has carefully gone through entire documentary evidence which
was before the Assessing Officer and which has been filed as annexures to this
Revision. This Court while admitting Revision has framed following questions
of law:
"i. WHETHER the action of the Respondents in not issuing FORM-D in favour of
the Revisionist after approval of the scheme of amalgamation by the Hon'ble
High Court of Delhi vide order dated 26.02.2016 in Company Petition No. 631 of
2015 under the provisions of Section 391 and 394 of the Indian Companies Act,
is legal and justified on the part of the Respondent authorities ?
ii. WHETHER the action of the Respondents in not issuing FORM-D in favour of
the petitioner is justified particularly when it infringes the exemptions
granted by the State Government vide notification dated 03.03.2016 ?
iii. WHETHER the Respondents herein as well as the Tribunal below were
justified in not appreciating the fact that by virtue of merger and
amalgamation being done under Section 391 and 394 of the Indian Companies Act
that any tax benefit or exemption that may be available to the Transferor
Company shall also enure to the Transferee Company ?"
25\. There is no doubt expressed by the Standing Counsel with regard to
issuance of Form K in favour of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. by the department for
the amount of sugar mentioned therein. Form K was issued in pursuance of
exemption notification 2016 and it clearly mentioned the details of issuance
viz. date of such Form K, date of purchase of such sugar, details of crushing
season, proof of invoices, amount of sugar in quintals and amount of sugar
value in rupees.
26\. In the Supplementary Affidavit, a document issued by Deputy Commissioner,
Commercial Tax, Gonda on 22.10.2019 has been filed which has not been denied
at any stage by the State respondents. It is also not disputed by State
respondents that M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. has merged as per Amalgamation
Scheme approved by Delhi High Court in Revisionist's Company w.e.f. 1.4.2016
and all sugar stock remaining as on date of merger, became sugar stock of
Revisionist and it was entitled to the same exemption on entry tax as claimed
by initial purchaser M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. on the basis of Form K issued on
purchase of sugar from M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill Ltd.
27\. It is also not disputed that only the remaining stock was transferred as
M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. had sold a major portion of sugar that it had bought
from M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill Ltd. during the course of Crushing Season
2015-16. M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. was also issued blank Form D by the
Assessing Officer on its request which M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. utilized in
certifying to its respective purchasers/dealers that such sugar had been
manufactured during the Crushing Season 2015-16 and no entry tax was levied on
the same. Form D issued by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. was accepted by the
Department and no questions were asked as is evident from Assessment Order
passed in favour of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. copy of which has been filed as
annexure to this Revision. Such annexures remain uncontroverted.
28\. If M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. would have continued to exist then the sugar
stock it had remaining on 1.4.2016 would have been entitled to exemption from
Entry Tax. If such stock being in possession of M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. was
entitled to exemption from Entry Tax then such stock on being transferred on
the acquisition of company by the Revisionist would also be entitled to such
exemption being manufactured in the Crushing Season 2015-16 and being bought
from same manufacturer M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mills in the same Assessment
Year.
29\. This is a classic case of Tax Authorities ignoring documentary evidence
already in their possession while assessing a Company which was merged with
the Revisionist. The import of Delhi High Court's order dated 26.2.2016 was
also ignored altogether. It seems that the left hand does not know what the
right hand is doing. The Assessing Authority accepted the very same documents
when produced by M/s. Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. showing that sugar which it had
bought from M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mill Ltd. was of the Crushing Season
2015-16 but inexplicably, the same Assessing Authority refused to accept same
documentary evidence when produced by the Revisionist.
30\. The action of respondents in not issuing Form D in favour of Revisionist
in pursuance of order dated 26.2.2016 is unjustified and arbitrary as the
stock transferred on merger of Company has been treated to be sold by the
transferor Company without there being any evidence with the Department to
substantiate such claim.
31\. The action of respondents in not issuing Form D in favour of the
revisionist also ignores the exemption granted by the State Government by
notification dated 3.3.2016.
32\. The Tribunal as well as Assessing Authority and the Appellate Authority
failed to appreciate that by virtue of merger and amalgamation having been
done under Sections 391 and 394 of Indian Companies Act, tax benefits and
exemptions that were available to Transferor Company would also enure to the
Transferee Company i.e. Revisionist.
33\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s Dalmia Power Ltd. and another vs.
Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Circle 1, Trichy, Civil Appeal no.9496-99
of 2019 decided on 18.12.2019 has considered the consequences of merger of two
Companies on the basis of an approved Amalgamation Scheme. It has observed in
Paras 4.6 and 4.7 as under:
"4.6. Pursuant thereto, the Schemes were sanctioned by the NCLT, Chennai vide
Orders 16.10.2017, 20.10.2017, 26.10.2017, 28.12.2017, 10.01.2018, 20.04.2018
and 01.05.2018; and, vide Orders dated 18.05.2017 and 30.08.2017 by the NCLT,
Guwahati. Accordingly, the Schemes attained statutory force 1 not only inter
se the Transferor and Transferee Companies, but also in rem, since there was
no objection raised either by the statutory authorities, the Department, or
other regulators or authorities, likely to be affected by the Schemes.
4.7. As a consequence, when the companies merged and amalgamated into another,
the amalgamating companies lost their separate identity and character, and
ceased to exist upon the approval of the Schemes of Amalgamation."
34\. The Supreme Court made these observations in a case where revised Income
Tax Returns were rejected by the Department on merger of the transferor and
transferee Company. The Supreme Court relied upon its observations in Marshall
Sons and Company (India) Ltd. vs. ITO (1997) 2 SCC 302 to observe that
pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation, the assessment of the
transferee Company must take into account the income of both the transferor
and transferee Companies. It was observed that filing of revised returns by
the transferee Company was not because of any omission or wrong statement
contained in the original returns but because delay occurred on account of
time taken to obtain sanction of the Scheme of Amalgamation. In the present
case the predecessor Company/transferor Company have been succeeded by the
Revisionist/transferee Company who had taken over its business along with
assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc. The stock transferred as a result
of amalgamation was not a sale requiring issuance of certificate by M/s.
Ritesh Vyaapar Ltd. in favour of the Revisionist as per the Exemption
Notification of 2016.
35\. The questions on which the Revision was initially admitted are answered
in favour of the Revisionist.
36\. The orders impugned are set aside.
37\. The Revision stands allowed. Consequences to follow.
Dated: December 15th, 2020 Sachin

1 of Rule 5 of U.P. Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Area Rules, 2008
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules of 2008').
5\. Under Section 4 of U.P. Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Area Act, 2007,
the State is entitled to levy and realise a tax on entry of goods specified in
the Schedule into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein, from any
place out of the local area at such rate not exceeding 5% of value of goods as
specified by the State Government by notification. Different rates may be
specified in respect of different goods or different class of goods. The State
Tax Returns were rejected by the Department on merger of the transferor and
transferee Company. The Supreme Court relied upon its observations in Marshall
Sons and Company (India) Ltd. vs. ITO (1997) 2 SCC 302 to observe that
pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation, the assessment of the
transferee Company must take into account the income of both the transferor
and transferee Companies. It was observed that filing of revised returns by
the transferee Company was not because of any omission or wrong statement
contained in the original returns but because delay occurred on account of
time taken to obtain sanction of the Scheme of Amalgamation. In the present
case the predecessor Company/transferor Company have been succeeded by the
Revisionist/transferee Company who had taken over its business along with
assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc. The stock transferred as a result
of amalgamation was not a sale requiring issuance of certificate by M/s.
