                                        ORDER
PER DIVA SINGH, JUDICIAL MEMBER By the present appeal filed by the assessee
the correctness of the order dated 30.11.2015 passed by the Assessing Officer
u/s 143 (3) r.w.s 144C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 has been assailed on the
following grounds:-
> 1\. "That on facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld. AO/ Ld.
> Transfer Pricing Officer ("TPO")/ Ld. Dispute Resolution Panel ("DRP") erred
> in making an addition of INR 25,92,72,701/- to the returned income of the
> Appellant by re-computing the arm's length price of the international
> transactions pertaining to all three segments of the Appellant, viz.
> engineering design and related services ("EDS"), financial accounting
> support services ("FAS") and IT infrastructure support services ("IT
> Infra"), under section 92 of the Act. Thus, in passing the order, the Ld. AO
> / Ld. TPO / Ld. DRP erred in:
> I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 1.1. Rejecting the comparable companies selected by
> the Appellant in its transfer pricing documentation on the basis of
> additional/modified quantitative filters which lacked valid and sufficient
> reasoning;
1.2. Accepting companies which were functionally not comparable to the
Appellant;
1.3. Including government held enterprises and enterprises associated with
government as comparables to the Appellant; 1.4. Not considering the correct
computation of/operating margins of certain comparables;
1.5. Denying the benefit of economic adjustments on account of difference in
risk profile in arriving at the arm's length margin; 1.6. Accepting high
turnover companies and thereby ignoring the impact of economies of scale; and
1.7. That on facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Ld.
AO/ Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP erred in selecting the current year (i.e. financial year
2010-11) data for comparability despite the fact that at the time of
preparation of transfer pricing documentation by the Appellant, the complete
data for financial year 2010-11 was not available within the public domain.
2\. That without prejudice to the above, if comparables selected the Ld. AO/
Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP that do not meet the parameters of functional comparability
are accepted, then on ground of consistency the comparables selected by the
Appellant that are rejected by Ld. AO/ Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP on account of
functional comparability; must also be accepted.
3\. That the Ld. AO/ Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP grossly erred in rejecting the segmental
accounts furnished by the Appellant in its TP Documentation. In doing so, Ld.
AO/ Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP has erred in:
3.1. considering liabilities written back and provisions as non-
operating in nature;
3.2. not considering the fact that there was no service rendered by the
Appellant to the AEs in relation to its international transaction for
'reimbursement of expenses received1;
3.3. by routing the reimbursement received through the segmental accounts
(both as revenue and expense) disregarding the fact that the same is not part
of Profit & Loss account of the Appellant; and 3.4. disregarding the
allocation undertaken by the Appellant in the respective segments and
allocating the same based on an inappropriate allocation key (revenue base).
4\. That the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO erred in not following the directions of the Ld.
DRP that segmental margins must be applied and considered consistently across
all segments (i.e. EDS, FAS and IT Infra segments) of the Appellant.
4.1. that without prejudice to the above, if the segmental accounts were to be
redrawn by the Ld. TPO / Ld. AO in line with the direction of the Ld. DRP, the
adjustments in the segments FAS and IT Infra would be reduced to NIL.
5\. That the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP erred in enhancing the income of the
Appellant by INR 10,58,456 by imputing interest on receivables  Page 2 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 from the AEs beyond the credit period of the
Appellant on an ad hoc basis. In doing so, the Ld. AO/ Ld. TPO/Ld. DRP has
grossly erred in: 5.1. selecting an ad hoc credit period and interest rate
while computing the addition; and 5.2. completely disregarding the detailed
submissions explaining that such adjustments are not mandated under the facts
and circumstances of the case.
6\. That the Ld. AO has erred in charging interest under section 234B and 234C
of the Act amounting to INR 5,16,24,544 and INR 10,61,745 respectively.
7\. That on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
Ld.AO has erred in initiating penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(c) of
the Act.
The Appellant craves leave to add, amend, alter, delete, rescind, forgo or
withdraw any of the above grounds of appeal either before or during the course
of the proceedings before the Hon'ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the
interest of the natural justice. The aforesaid grounds are mutually exclusive
and without prejudice to each other."
2\. The relevant facts of the case are that the assessee incorporated on
21.04.1994 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bechtel Corporation USA. During the
year, the assessee company was engaged in the business of export of customized
electronic data in the form of designs, drawings, calculations and other
relevant datasheet relating to Project Engineering and Commercial Solutions
for power plant, refinery, petrochemical plant etc. 2.1. The following
international transactions were disclosed by the assessee in the year under
consideration :-

following results:-
    Particulars                Provision           of Provision of Financial Provision     of        IT
                               Engineering    design support services        infrastructure

    3.       The three segments were considered by the TPO separately.                       Qua the
Engineering Design Segment, he accepted the assessee's selection of TNMM as
the most appropriate method and also the PLI of OP/TC. The PLI of the company
arrived at 9.12% by the assessee was recalculated by the TPO at 8.98% on cost.
The average PLI of the 11 comparables at 12.57% in its TP study was not
accepted by the TPO and a show cause notice was issued to the assessee. 3.1.
Considering the reply, the Transfer Pricing Officer discarded the approach
followed by the assessee and required the assessee to carry out a fresh
search. Rejecting 7 out of the 11 comparables offered by the assessee in the
fresh search he introduced a few more and considering the average OP/TC of
30.19% of the following 18 comparables held that the adjustment for arm's
length price was warranted:-
    S. No.     Company Name                                                   OP/ TC (%)*

4\. In the Financial and Accounting Support Service Segment the TPO accepted
selection of TNMM as the most appropriate method as well as the selection of
OP/TC as the PLI. The assessee's PLI was re-computed and its claim of the
transaction being at arm's length on the basis of the average PLI of the 9
comparables at 11.10% was faulted with requiring the assessee to carry out a
fresh search.
4.1. In the fresh search the assessee offered 9 comparables out of which 4
were rejected by the TPO on the grounds of failing the filter applied and
functional dissimilarity. The average OP/TC margin of 25.98% of the following
8 comparables which included companies introduced by the TPO was worked out: -
          S.No.   Company Name                                                      OP/TC (%)*

5\. Considering the benchmarking of Infrastructure Support Service Segment the
TPO accepting the assessee's approach of taking TNMM as the most appropriate
method and also accepting the PLI of OP/TC rejected the assessee's claim that
the transaction was at arm's length price. The TP study in regard to average
PLI of 12.57% of the 5 comparables selected when compared to assessee's OP/TC
of 18.32% was rejected. The assessee's OP/TC margin was again re- calculated
and the assessee was required to carry out a fresh search. 5.1. Rejecting all
the 5 comparables so offered in the fresh search, the TPO selected the
following final list of comparable having OP/TC of 23.55% to hold that the
transaction was not at arm's length: -
S.No. Company Name OP/TC (%)*
1\. Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Information Technology services 22.06%
segment)
2\. Akshay Software technologies Ltd. 0.86%
3\. Celstream Technologies Private Ltd. 13.20%
4\. e-Infochips India Private Ltd. 56.44%

19\. Wipro Technology Services Ltd. 54.42% Mean 23.55%  Page 6 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015
6\. The assessee carried these issue before the DRP not only on the grounds of
comparability but also on the ground that working capital adjustment were not
provided. The TPO was also assailed on the ground that contrary to facts he
redrew the segmental on the following grounds:-
> \- treating reimbursement of expenses received as part (i.e. part of both
> expense and income) of Profit & Loss ('P&L');
> \- reallocation of certain expenses (which were not actuals) based on the
> revenue of each segment; and
> \- treating provision/liabilities written back as non-operating in nature.
6.1. The argument was put up that if the TPO's stand is accepted then
following position would emerge:-
    S.No.       Nature    of    international Tested   Party's   Arm's     length Adjustment u/s
                transaction                   margin as per      margin           92CA

                                              redrawn by The     ld.TPO
                                              Ld.TPO

    2.          Provision of FAS services         10.52%             25.98%           70,84,259
    3.          Provision    of    IT   Infra     14.32%             23.55%          1,21,12,787

6.2. It was submitted that the above computation has not been computed by the
TPO, as it has been computed on the basis of the margins of the other 2
segments. The said issue was stated to be pending before the Assessing Officer
by way of rectification application. By way of the synopsis filed in the
present proceedings, it has been submitted that the direction of the DRP
holding that the margin results must be considered consistently across the
segments has not been carried out. The TPO has also been faulted for not
considering the revised margin from the  Page 7 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
redrawn segmental accounts. His suo moto action of passing rectification order
under section 154 wherein selective correction of margins of Engineering
Division Segment has been assailed. The resultant increase to 21.57% and
18.06% in the Financial Account Segment and IT infrastructure it has been
assailed has been ignored by the TPO.
6.3. The TPO was also assailed on the ground that the benefit of economic
adjustments (working capital and risk adjustments) was not granted to the
assessee while computing the arm's length margins of the respective segments
of the company. The fact that it was requested for it was submitted is evident
from internal pages 85 to 87 of the TPO.
6.4. Addressing the order of the TPO it was further submitted that the TPO at
internal pages 88 to 100 and 113 made an adjustment on account of period of
delay in receipt of payments from AEs by imputing an Indian based interest at
the rate of 10.84% per annum for the period of delay in receipt of payments
from AEs beyond 60 days.
6.5. As a result of these actions, it has been submitted that the following
adjustments were proposed in the transfer pricing order post rectification

DRP accepted the approach and the comparable selected by the TPO . 6.9. It was
submitted that the DRP also directed the TPO to provide working capital
adjustment. However, risk adjustment was denied to the assessee. 6.10.
Referring to internal page 37 of the DRP's order it was submitted that the DRP
directed the TPO to consistently apply the segment results for all the three
segments which direction has not been carried out. The relevant extract relied
upon is reproduced hereunder:-
> 4.7. ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD COSTS "In his order, the TPO has reproduced the

> (OP/OC). For the engineering design segment, this calculation is given on

> segmental revenue, whereas the assessee had allocated these expenses on the
> basis of allocation keys, such as total hours spent by personnel, payroll
> cost, etc. The assessee argued that the TPO had followed an inconsistent

6.11. Referring to page 74 to 81 of the DRP's order it was submitted that the
DRP directed the TPO/AO to use 6 month LIBOR plus 300 basis points as the

7.1. The grievance of the assessee in the present proceedings, it was
submitted persists qua 9 of the comparables which have been mentioned at
serial No. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14 in the above table.
7.2. In the said background, inviting attention to Ground No. 1, it was
submitted that with respect to the Engineering Design and Related Services
Segment the assessee acts as a captive service provider and is required to
carry out the detailed engineering design and drawing on the basis of
specifications and requirements provided by the AEs. The assessee is also
involved in the internal project planning, scheduling, project management,
monitoring progress, reporting etc. for the scope of work outsourced by AEs.
Exclusion of the above comparables it was submitted has been requested on the
basis of the following settled broad parameters by way of consistent orders of
the ITAT in assessee's own case as per orders in 2004-05, 2005-06 & 2009-10
and 2010-11 AYs, copies of which have been placed in the Paper Book filed:-
> (a) 'government owned enterprises' or 'the enterprises affiliated with
> government projects' are not comparable and must be rejected for determining
> the arm's length margins; and
> (b) Comparables which are functionally different to the business of the
> Appellant must be rejected."
7.3. Accordingly on the basis of these parameters the exclusion of the
following 5 following comparables was sought. Apart from that specific facts
supporting the prayer are also brought out in the following chart-
S.No. Companies selected in Appellant's contentions the final order
1\. Certification - Rejected in Appellant's own case for AY Engineering

book for order of the Hon'ble ITAT}.
(refer page no.293 of - Involved in activities beyond engineering design the
appeal set for which BIPL provides.
Ld.DRP directions) - Engaged in activities that extends from concept to
commissioning whereas BIPL provides services under the aegis of its overseas.
The diversified functions of this company include pre- project activities,
procurement assistance, project management, commissioning and coordination,
inspection, construction and supervision.
\- No segmentation available in the annual report of the Company which
provides profitability for the engineering design segment.
(refer page nos.117 to 121 of the appeal set for submission filed before the
Ld.DRP).
5\. IBI Chematur - Rejected in Appellant's own case for AY (Engineering &
2010-11 (ITA No.1478/Del/2015)  Page 12 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
Consultancy) Ltd. [refer page no.617 of the paper book for order of the
Hon'ble ITAT].
(OP/TC=26.87%) - Involved in activities beyond engineering design which BIPL
provides.
(refer page no.291 of - Also provides project planning, management the appeal
set for services, procurement assistance, project Ld.DRP directions)
management, commissioning and coordination, inspection, construction and
supervision etc.
\- No segmentation available in the annual report of the Company which
provides profitability for the engineering design segment.
\- Undertakes substantial R&D activities (R&D expenses approximately 4% of
turnover) (refer page nos.122 to 125 of the appeal set for submission filed
before the Ld.DRP) 7.4. In the case of Rites Ltd. mentioned at Sl.No.13 it was
submitted that the directions of the DRP directing the TPO to consider the
correct margin have not been complied with. The exclusion of this comparable
was also sought on the basis of past precedent in assessee's own case.
7.5. Apart from the above six comparables as having been wrongly selected by
the TPO and retained by the DRP, the exclusion of REC Power Distribution
Company Limited it was submitted is sought on similar reasoning namely that it
is a wholly owned subsidiary of REC Ltd. a Navratna CPSE under Ministry of
Power. REC Ltd. it was submitted 60% holding therein was by the state and
central governments as per information available on the site of
(www.moneycontrol.com). Referring to the Objections before the DRP and the
synopsis filed it was submitted it is not only functionally dissimilar but
even the annual report would show that qua the activities of develop,
construct, own, operate, distribute and maintain 66 KV and below voltage class
electrification/distribution electric supply lines/Distribution System. No
segmentation was available -  Page 13 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 (http://www.indiamart.com/recpower-
distribution/aboutus.html) & (annual report). The said company it was
submitted has no segmentation for the "services of Inspection" and
"Consultancy" provided. The services provided range from Third party
Inspection of works and materials as well as projects in High Voltage
Distribution Segments and various State Electricity Boards. Accordingly it was
submitted that exclusion of RITES is supported not only by the fact that it
renders services largely to Government/government enterprises and not in the
free market but it also derives benefit out of its parental relation with the
Government in getting contracts from the (state or centre) derives government
itself and other government undertaking and thus is getting the benefit of an
implicit guarantee leading to a preferential treatment in obtaining contracts
from government/government undertakings. This protection and preferential
treatment it was submitted inevitably impacts the profit margins of the said
comparable and it cannot be said to be indicative of a free market economy
where the other comparables and the assessee operates. Reliance accordingly
was placed on Chemtex Global Engineering Private Limited ITA No. 3590/Mum/2010
where government owned companies have been rejected due to this specific
reason:-
> 25\. "Even with regard to the comparable companies which are taken into
> consideration by the AO/TPO the learned CIT(A) has correctly held that Rites
> Limited is a Government of India enterprise and considering the nature of
> the contracts and the implicit guarantee provided by the Government of
> India, etc. Rites Limited cannot be taken as a comparable case and hence the
> learned CIT(A) was justified in excluding the same."
> [Emphasis Supplied] 7.5.1. Relying on the same, it was submitted the nature
> of contracts and the implicit guarantee, the comparable (in this case Rites
> Limited) cannot be accepted.
Page 14 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 The said reasoning it was submitted is equally true
for REC Power Distribution Ltd. which has most of its contracts from
Government of India thus impacting the revenue and profitability. Apart from
that REC Power Distribution is a 100% government owned undertaking. Thus it
was argued that this case squarely covers the assessee's contentions that
these comparables ought be excluded. 7.5.2. Rendering services majorly to
Government/government enterprises it was submitted is a principle followed in
assessee's own case for AY 2009-10 (supra), wherein the Tribunal has rejected
a comparable on this issue. Accordingly REC Power Distribution, (being an
indirect government owned undertaking) it was submitted deserves to be
excluded. Reliance was also placed on the ruling of M/s ThyssenKrupp
Industries India Private Limited ITA No. 6460/Mum/2012 where the following was
held:
> "We find it as undisputed that Engineers India Limited is a Government
> company. It has several segments which also include 'Turnkey project', page
> 700 of the paper book is a copy of annual report of Engineers India Limited
> on turnkey project. It can be seen that the revenue has arisen from
> completing paraxylene plant of IOCL and further that company is engaged in
> execution of other unit of IOCL's Panipat Naphtha cracker project. In our
> considered opinion' this case should not have been included in the list of
> final comparables for two reasons. First reason is that profit motive is not
> a relevant consideration in case of Government undertakings. Many Government
> Undertakings even operate on losses in furtherance of the social obligations
> of the government. The second reason is that Engineers India Limited earned
> income from turnkey project by successfully completing the project of IOCL
> and other Public Sector Undertakings. In that sense of the matter, the
> related party transactions are much more than the filter of 25%. We,
> therefore order for the exclusion of this case from the list of
> comparables."
> (Emphasis Supplied) 7.5.3. Accordingly relying on the said order it was
> submitted that the comparable being considered namely (Engineers India
> Limited) had been rejected on the  Page 15 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
> ground that it was working for government / public sector undertakings and
> since
> \- RFC Power Distribution's transactions were also largely with other
> government owned enterprises, the transactions tantamount to related party
> transactions.
Accordingly it was argued that the said comparable cannot be accepted as the
transactions are not uncontrolled.
7.6. Apart from seeking the exclusion of the above 6 comparables the inclusion
of the following 2 companies was sought on the ground that they were
functionally similar and have been wrongly rejected by the TPO. Even in the
earlier years the TPO it was submitted had rejected these comparables and only
on the direction of the ITAT/and/or the DRP have been included :-
S.No. Company rejected in Appellant's contentions the final order
1\. UB Engineering Ltd. - Functionally similar-provides services pertaining to
EPC projects, infrastructure, on-

of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 for Ld.DRP directions) submission filed before
the Ld.DRP) 7.7. The exclusion of the following 3 comparables companies was
sought on the ground that these companies were palpably different from the
Engineering Design Segment of the assessee:-

for the the submission filed before the Ld.DRP) Ld. DRP directions)  Page 17
of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 7.8. Accordingly it was submitted that in case
the assessee succeeds in its prayer then the final list of compatibles would
be as under:-
         S.No. Company Name                                    WC adjusted OP/TC
         1.    Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Engineering Design             14.26%
               Services)
         2.    Arvind Accel Ltd.                                            2.47%
         3.    Cades Digitech Pvt.Ltd.                                      2.84%

8\. The Ld. Sr. DR on the other hand vehemently argued for retaining the
comparables. It was his submission that in the method like TNMM as long as
broad comparability is established then exclusion on micro differences cannot
be argued. The selectively picking apart the list of comparable it was
submitted should not be allowed.
8.1. Addressing the specific objections it was his submission that government
owned enterprises or enterprises affiliated with government projects should
not be excluded. It was his argument that admittedly the government companies
are entrusted with works in areas where due to huge unprofitable costs the
private enterprise does not want to enter thus the argument for their
exclusion it was submitted is without any basis. The work entrusted to these
government companies it was submitted admittedly is not profit driven as the
aim is development and social benefits. Thus the inclusion of these companies
where their creation and functioning is only motivated by development agenda
and if,  Page 18 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 even then they are able to
show a profit then by no standards they should be considered for exclusion.
The assessee it was submitted has no such laudable aims and is operating
purely for profits thus it cannot claim to say that it is earning less profit
than the companies who are guided by noble aims of social and economic
development. Accordingly it was his submission that a comparable should not be
excluded on this count.
8.2. It was also his argument that when a method like TNMM is accepted then
the assessee cannot argue on the basis of these micro minor differences in the
profiles of the companies and pray for their exclusion. The exercise of
selecting comparable whose OP/TC margin admittedly was higher than what was
acceptable to the assessee for exclusion was strongly opposed especially
keeping in mind that for some of the comparable as in the case of Kitco Ltd,
it was his submission that the issue is agitated for the first time before the
ITAT. Objecting to the prayer for its exclusion it was his strong objection
that firstly this prayer was never before the TPO; secondly no Objections were
raised for its exclusion even before the DRP; and thirdly even before the ITAT
the assessee has not made any effort to point out that the prayer is being
made before the ITAT the first time. Further it was also his Objection that
the assessee has not cared to pray for admission of any additional ground as
no such prayer has been made. Accordingly it was his prayer that the
generalistic arguments of removing comparable on past precedence or some
decision in some other case may not be accepted. The selection of comparables
wherein the assessee has fully participated it was submitted cannot be
outrightly changed at the appellate stage merely relying on precedent  Page 19
of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 accepting arguments where even the similarity
of facts has not been cared to be established by the assessee. The arguments
it was submitted cannot be accepted as the facts may differ from year to year
in the case of the assessee or the comparable or in the precedent cited and
the prayer for exclusion of a comparable it was submitted would presume that
the same level of hair splitting is done vis-à- vis the assessee as the tested
party and the assessee in the precedent cited. No such effort it was submitted
has been made to establish these facts qua each comparable. The issues it was
submitted have been decided on the basis of facts on record and the consistent
findings on record in regard to the comparables was heavily relied upon.
9\. The Ld. AR in reply fairy conceded that the exclusion of Kitco Ltd. was
requested for, for the first time before the ITAT in the facts of the present
case. However, inviting attention to the order of the ITAT in 2010-11
assessment year order dated 21.12.2015 in ITA No. 1478/Del/2015, it was
submitted that the position was identical in the facts of that case also.
Inviting attention to the copy of the said order filed in the paper book, it
was submitted that the exclusion of the said comparable was sought for the
first time before the ITAT and it was allowed. Accordingly it is only on the
basis of the said precedent that this prayer has been made. The relevant
extract from the order of the Co-ordinate Bench at internal page 9 to 11 of
2010-11 AY is reproduced hereunder for ready-reference:-
KITCO LTD.
12.1. "The company was established in 1972 by Industrial Development Bank of
India, other national and state level financial institutions, Government of
Kerala and 7 public sector banks for rendering services to government
departments, public sector undertakings ("PSU's"), local  Page 20 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 bodies, entrepreneurs, etc. The company's main functions
are to render professional technical consultancy assistance to banks
(appraisal of projects in priority sectors) and to entrepreneurs operating in
SME sector (preparation of project report, market studies and conducting
training program's). However, over the years Kitco has evolved into a
multifunctional and multi-disciplinary organization and has started offering
consultancy service from 'concept to commissioning'. As portfolio of services
offered by Kitco currently includes the following: • Project consultancy;
• Detailed design engineering and project execution; • Technical services;
• Environmental Engineering; and • HRD consultancy 12.2. The assessee fairly
submits that Kitco is a 100% government owned undertaking, rendering services
primarily to central/state government undertaking and PSUs. It is not in
dispute that most of the clients or projects undertaken by this company are
either for state government or government run institutions. The majority
revenue (and profitability) of this company comes from government (state or
center) run projects and that the company derives benefit out of its parental
relation with the Government in getting contract. In other words, the company
is getting the benefit of preferential treatment in obtaining contracts from
government/government undertakings. This inevitably impacts the profit margins
of the said comparable and cannot be said to be indicative of a free market
economy where the other comparables and the assessee operates.
12.3. In this regard the assessee placed its reliance on the ruling of M/s
ThyssenKrupp Industries India Private Limited ITA No. 6460/Mum/2012 wherein it
has been held asunder:
> "We find it as undisputed that Engineers India Limited is a Government
> company. It has several segments which also include 'Turnkey project' page
> 700 of the paper book is a copy of annual report of Engineers India Limited
> on turnkey project. It can be seen that the revenue has arisen from
> completing paraxylene plant of IOCL and further that company is engaged in
> execution of other unit of IOCL's Panipat Naphtha cracker project. In our
> considered opinion' this case should not have been included in the list of
> final comparables for two reasons. First reason is that profit motive is not
> a relevant consideration in case of Government undertakings. Many Government
> Undertakings even operate on losses in furtherance of the social obligations
> of the government. The second reason is that Engineers India Limited earned
> income from turnkey project by successfully completing the project of IOCL
> and other Public Sector Undertakings. In that sense of the matter, the
> related party transactions are much more than the filter of  Page 21 of 50
> I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 25%. We, therefore, order for the exclusion of this
> case from the list of comparables."
> [Emphasis Supplied] 12.5. In the above ruling, the comparable M/s. Engineers
> India Limited was rejected primarily on the ground that it was working for
> government/public sector undertakings and since the company also being a
> government owned enterprise; the transactions tantamount to related party
> transactions. The same is true for the said comparable as Kitco Ltd.,
> transactions are primarily with government owned enterprises. Applying the
> preposition laid down in the case of M/s ThyssenKrupp Industries India
> Private Limited (supra), we hold that Kitco Ltd., cannot be accepted as a
> comparable company. Hence the same is directed to be eliminated."
10\. Not convinced with the argument the Ld.CIT DR submitted that the fact
that its exclusion was agitated before the ITAT for the first time is not
coming out of this order and the prayer for exclusion of the said comparable
de horse the ground was objected to.
11\. In view of the fact that the hearing in the appeal spilled over on 3
different dates. The Ld. AR sought permission to raise an additional ground
and on the next date the Ld.AR filed a petition seeking admission of
additional ground requesting for exclusion of Kitco Ltd on the reasoning that
an identical prayer had been accepted by the Co-ordinate Bench in 2010-11
assessment year. 11.1. The prayer was opposed by the Ld.CIT DR.
12\. We have heard the rivals submissions and perused the material available
on record. It is seen that the transfer pricing approach of the assessee was
set aside by the Transfer Pricing Officer not only on the grounds that the
taxpayer had used multiple your data but also on the grounds of the filters
applied etc. were considered to be inappropriate filters and after identifying
the correct filters  Page 22 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 according to him a
fresh search was required to be carried out and after modifying the outcome of
the same resulted in the passing of the TPO's order dated 29.01.2015. Pursuant
to the draft order being passed by the Assessing Officer, the assessee filed
its objections before the DRP and also Rectification petition u/s 154 before
the TPO. In pursuance to the DRP's order dated 28.10.2015, the final
assessment order under section 143(3)/144C dated 30.11.2015 has been passed.
It is the correctness of this order which is under challenge in the present
proceedings on the basis of the grounds raised.
12.1. Before we address the comparables selected whose retention and exclusion
has been challenged, we consider it appropriate to first address the
functional profile considered by the DRP which has not been challenged in the
present proceedings before us by way of any ground or argument. The DRP as per
internal page 22 to 25 qua this segment has held the assessee to be engaged in
providing high-end engineering design services and procurement and
construction management services described as EPC (Engineering Procurement
Construction Company). The relevant extract from the DRP's order is reproduced
hereunder:-
> 4.3 FUNCTIONAL PROFILE
> 1) "Before considering the appropriateness of the comparables used, it is
> necessary to consider the functional profile of the assessee. The assessee

> Work-Order.
2) The assessee failed to furnish any further details such as Work Order, etc.
regarding the nature of services rendered.
3) The assessee's TP study gives the following information about the assessee:
          (i)     BIPL was formed to:
          •    Carry on engineering design, drafting, project monitoring and
control, project support, procurement services and construction services;
• Create a multidiscipline engineering center for the Group's projects and to
provide administration and processing services to group entities;
• Establish a strong local engineering presence for projects in India;
• Provide financial and management accounting services; • Develop a cost-
effective resource base for projects worldwide through associations with major
Indian producers and equipment manufacturers and also providing procurement
services for other group entities; and • Provide out-sourced services to
overseas group entities.
(ii) Over the last 15 years, BIPL has been associated with a number of
international and national projects. BIPL has serviced power, petroleum,
chemicals, mining and metal projects  Page 24 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
worldwide. In India, it has provided support to projects like Reliance
Refinery and the Dabhol Power Project.
BIPL has developed its expertise in such services by engaging engineers. The
work relating to preparation of engineering designs, drawings, etc is based on
customized/ specific project requirements of the associated group companies
engaged in different projects.
Engineering personnel work in a completely automated environment using the
latest Computer Aided Design ('CAD') and 3D modeling software, integrating the
Group's global, and multi- business engineering expertise through dedicated
WAN link. BIPL is an ISO 9001: 2OOO company.
BIPL primarily provides technical support services in respect of engineering
design and drawings to other group entities both within and outside India. It
also provides IT infrastructure and financial and accounting support services
to its group entities.
(iii) As a part of its business operations, BIPL provides engineering design
and related services which are closely linked with the performance of
engineering, construction and turnkey project execution industry. Companies
seeking finance to build large facilities such as power plants, refineries,
and steel mills are generally required by the debt providers or equity
investors to obtain a lump sum turnkey engineering, procurement, and
construction contract with a credit-worthy contractor having satisfactory
industry-related experience and capabilities. Such a contractor is an EPC
company. The EPC contractor is required to provide single source process and
schedule guarantees to minimize the risks to the client and its investors.
In the EPC industry, a different market environment exists from many other
industries. EPC companies are responsible for designing, constructing and
managing all issues associated with major projects including chemical plants,
power plants and other large facilities. In the global market, risk is pushed
onto the EPC industry via fixed price contracts. The facility owners want a
lower cost, but want the EPC contractor to assume more risk and meet a tighter
schedule.
EPC companies derive revenues from executing projects for clients on a cost-
reimbursable, or lump sum basis.
They complete entire work from initial feasibility studies, to detailed
engineering, and construction and operations management of the actual project
facilities.
Engineering
1\. Determine all facility, equipment, and material requirements
2\. Produce all technical deliverables required to execute the project
3\. Review vendor proposals
4\. Ensure safety design.
Page 25 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 Procurement:
1\. Globally source material & equipment from proven manufacturers
2\. Manage logistics of delivering material & equipment to site
3\. Expediting delivery to ensure project is completed as scheduled
Construction:
1\. Ensure facility is completed on time, in budget and to specification
2\. Provide a range of services from overall construction management to actual
construction and commissioning services
4) It is apparent from the above that the assesses is engaged in providing
high-end engineering design services and procurement and construction
management services. Companies providing these services are commonly referred
to as EPC (Engineering Procurement Construction) companies. It is with this
background that the functional similarity of comparables is required to be
examined.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 12.2. Addressing the grounds
raised and the submissions of the parties before the Bench, we are of the view
that the prayer of the assessee made in support of  Page 26 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 Ground No.1.3 considering the precedent cited deserves to
be allowed. We find that though the arguments advanced by the Ld.CIT DR appear
to be convincing however in the face of the facts and submissions considered
in the precedent cited, we find that the assessee has established that those
comparables which had Government holdings/affiliated or controlled enjoyed
preferential treatment in obtaining contracts or benefits derived out of the
parental relation which fact successfully establishes the impact of these
facts on the net profitability of the government owned/controlled or
affiliated companies. Thus these companies cannot be said to indicative of a
comparable operating in a free market economy. Thus, there is strong
justification for their exclusion from the list of comparable companies.
Accordingly the exclusion of such comparable companies from the list of
comparable companies on facts is found to be justified. 12.3. Having so said,
we find that when out of the total 15 comparables considered post DRP,
exclusion of six is sought on the grounds of past precedent and on the ground
that these companies affiliated/owned or controlled by the government need to
be excluded it castes a doubt on the process of selection and retention of the
comparables companies. When this fact is read alongwith the fact that when
seven out of the eleven comparables offered by the assessee are rejected by
the TPO and eleven more introduced by him totaling 18 in all are reduced by 4
on the directions of the DRP on the prayer of the assessee and one comparable
is directed to be included again at the instance of the assessee the doubt
converts into a certainty. The certainty is further converted into a hard
reality when it is coupled with the prayer to further include two comparable
companies which had been  Page 27 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 excluded by
the TPO in the earlier years as in the present year and on the strength of the
precedent available by way of directions in earlier years by the appellate
authorities the comparables it is pleaded may be included. The entire gamut of
facts and events uninhibitedly demonstrate that in the process of selection of
comparables both the tax payer as well as the tax authorities have faulted.
However, we find that even if these corrections so requested are considered
even then the grievance remains qua this list of 15 comparables post DRP as
there still exists a prayer for further request for reducing this list by
excluding the following 3 comparables on the grounds of being "palpably
different from EDS" namely Usha Hydrodynamics Ltd; Mitcom Consultancy &
Engineering Services Ltd. and Global Procurement Consultant Ltd. The request
prima facie does not appear to be maintainable because as opposed to "EDS" the
profile of the tax payer as on record in the present proceedings has been
accepted as "EPC" and as observed there is no challenge to this finding either
by any argument on facts nor by way of any ground. However, the prayer in view
of the subsequent finding is not relevant as we find that in the peculiar
facts of the present case the entire exercise of selection of comparables has
to be done again. As considering the arguments of the assessee in support of
its prayer and the departmental stand thereon, we find that there can be no
two opinions on the fact that it is unequivocally demonstrated on the face of
the record that the exercise of proposal and selection process of comparables
by the assessee and the tax authorities has not been carried out as per
settled legal precedents. Namely government related,
protected/affiliated/favoured companies rendering "Certification/Inspection"
services etc. cannot be said to be companies  Page 28 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 comparable to an assessee who operates in free market
conditions. Thus, ideally such companies should never have been selected.
Similarly companies trading in products and goods or providing vocational
training as government affiliates also cannot be said to be functionally
similar to EPC. These issues are well settled by now and selection contrary to
this settled position admittedly either by way of proposal by the assessee or
by way of retention/selection by the TPO was not correct. In support of the
parties, we take note of the fact that at the time of preparation of the
Transfer Pricing study or passing of the TPO's order on 29.01.2015 the
assessee and the TPO did not have the benefit of the judicial precedent in
assessee's own case which is heavily relied upon by the Ld.AR. Let alone the
TPO even the DRP or the AO at the stage of final assessment order did not have
the benefit of these orders as the order of the ITAT in 2004-05 AY is dated
20.11.2015; in 2005-06 AY it is dated 23.09.2015 and the order for 2009-10 AY
is dated 14.10.2015 and in 2010-11 AY it is pronounced on 27.12.2015. The
order of the TPO on the other hand is dated 29.01.2015 and the order of the
DRP is dated 28.10.2015. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to not attempt a
patch work exercise at this stage where admittedly the entire exercise has
been misguided in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case by
addressing the comparable selected or left out and restore the issue back to
the file of the TPO to consider the issue denovo and pass a speaking order in
accordance with law after giving the assessee a reasonable opportunity of
being heard.  Page 29 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 12.4. The decision to restore is further supported by
the fact that as per the stand of the parties the Rectification Petition dated
14.12.2015 is still pending before the AO.
12.5. We further find that qua this segment the DRP's direction to the TPO to
apply the segment results for all the 3 segments consistently has also
admittedly not been carried out leading to the grievance of the assessee
expressed by Ground No. 3 and 4 alongwith their sub-grounds. For the said
purposes, reliance has been placed on Lummus Technology Heat Transfer BV ITA
No.6227/Del/2012. The prayer of the assessee being that segmental P&L account
has been prepared using reasonable and specific allocation basis by the
assessee. 12.5.1. Without prejudice to the above prayer on the said issue it
is also requested that if the revised segmental margins are considered the
margins in the EDS segment would meet the arm's length standard if the
grievance qua the comparables are accepted; and the margins in the other two
segments i.e. FAS and IT infra would meet the arm's length criterion even
after considering the comparables considered by the TPO/DRP and the
rectification application. Accordingly in the light of these facts and
submissions it has been requested that should the segmentation of the TPO be
accepted and consider the margins of the assessee in all the three segments
satisfies the arm's-length criteria. The said argument has been raised without
prejudice to the fact that certain comparable is in the other 2 segments i.e.
FAS and IT Infra are functionally stated to be dissimilar and have been
rejected by the Tribunal in assessee's own case in 2010- 11 assessment year.
Page 30 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 12.6. It is also seen that the taxpayer has also
requested for working capital adjustment, risk adjustment in the comparables
relying on past precedent. Although, we find that no working thereof has been
placed before us but even otherwise, we find in the peculiar facts of the case
that in view of the decision taken the issue is not required to be addressed
at this stage. Suffice it to say that if it all any working capital
adjustments or risk adjustments in the comparables proposed by the TPO is
warranted the taxpayer should be able to support its claim by way of
justifying the extent of adjustments requested as the law contemplates that
adjustment is to be requested for by the assessee and supported by way of
placing necessary justification in support of its prayer. 12.7. Accordingly,
in view of the above detailed reasoning on facts addressing the various
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case it is deemed appropriate to
restore the issue back to the TPO to decide the same afresh by way of a
speaking order in accordance with law after giving the assessee a reasonable
opportunity of being heard.
13\. Addressing the Financial Accounting Support Service Segment, we find that
the TPO rejected 4 out of the 9 comparables proposed by the taxpayer and
ultimately adopted 8 comparables having an OP/TC of 25.98% which compared with
the recomputed OP/TC of 21.57% compared to assessee's original OP/TC of 21.80%
was considered to be warranting adjustment for arms length price. The DRP it
is submitted did not make any changes in the comparables selected by the TPO.
Page 31 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 13.1. The assessee seeks exclusion of Accentia
Technologies Ltd. on the ground that it has been rejected in assessee's own
case for 2010-11 assessment year. Reliance has been placed upon the decision
of the Hon'ble High Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions (TS - 387-HC-
2015 (Del) - TP (specific Paras 29, 31, 33 to 35) for the proposition that the
KPO i.e. Knowledge Process Outsourcing company cannot be compared to a low-
ended IT enabled service provider. It has also been urged that it has
significant amount of brands; IPR and Goodwill and the lack of segmental
information has further been cited as a ground for its exclusion.
13.2. Exclusion of Eclerx Services Ltd has been requested on the grounds of
functional dissimilarity. The prayer it is submitted is also supported by the
decision of the Hon'ble jurisdiction High Court in the case of Rampgreen
solutions (cited supra) amongst various other orders of the ITAT. 13.3. The
exclusion of TCSE Serve Limited has been sought on the grounds that it has
been rejected in assessee's own case in 2010-11 assessment year, reliance is
placed on the order of the ITAT.
13.4. The Ld.AR submits that if these 3 comparables are excluded then the
OP/TC of the 5 comparables which remained would work out to 10.20%. When it is
compared with the margins of the assessee of 10.29% (or 21.57%, if redrawn
segmental account is considered), the transaction it was submitted would
satisfy the arm's-length criteria. In support of the said prayer the following
chart has been placed before us:-

14\. The Ld. CIT DR relies upon the order of the authorities below, no
distinguishable fact or circumstance was brought to the notice of the Bench.
15\. Considering the submission of the parties before the Bench, we deem it
appropriate to first address the functional profile of the assessee on the
basis of record. We find that the same has been addressed in internal pages 38
and 39 of the DRP holding that the assessee is a high end KPO in this segment.
The relevant extract is reproduced hereunder:-

15.1. We find that in the precedent relied upon the discussion on the
functional profile does not bring out whether the segment was held to be a
high end KPO:-
> 13.2. "In the FA segment, the functions of the appellant company are,
> invoice processing, help desk support, account closing and management
> reporting, tax advisory services, management of fund. The assessee contended
> that the Ld.TPO/DRP has accepted certain comparables, which perform
> altogether different functions as compared to assessee's FAS and IT infra
> segment, and have extra-ordinary circumstances based on which they should
> not be included."
15.2. Accordingly we find that reliance placed on the following finding is of
no relevance:-
> 13.3. "We would now examine each of the comparable company in dispute to
> arrive at a conclusion.
Page 34 of 50
> I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 Comparables included by the Ld.TPO/DRP but disputed
> by the assessee:
> 1) TCS E-Serve International Limited & TCS E-serve Limited This company has
> been selected by the ld.TPO as a comparable. This company undertakes,
> customer service, transaction processes, collections, risk management, and
> analytics, and has created a lot of applications which are in the nature of
> intellectual property in terms of reconciliation software, fund transfers,
> etc. The company also undertakes software testing and validation activities.
> Possession of intellectual property rights has to be factored if such a
> company is to be taken as comparable. This cannot be done unless there is
> appropriate data. Further, from the TP study we observe that, this company
> is a wholly owned subsidiary of TCS E serve International Ltd. During the
> year under consideration, this company has made payments towards use of Tata
> brand. Consequentially use of the TCS brand has substantially increased the
> operating profits post acquisition. Hence we are of the opinion that this
> company cannot be taken as a comparable. We therefore direct to exclude this
> comparable.
> (emphasis provided)
> 2) Accentia Technologies Limited This company has been included by the
> ld.TPO as a comparable. Functionally, Accentia Technologies Ltd., is into
> development of software products for healthcare. It is submitted by the
> ld.AR that Accentia Technologies Ltd is also engaged into diversified
> activities such as Knowledge Process outsourcing(KPO), Legal process
> outsourcing(LPO), Data process Outsourcing(DTO), high end software services.
> It is also submitted by the ld.AR that segmental information in respect of
> this company is not available. It has been further brought to our notice
> that this company has been rejected by the Ld.TPO in the earlier year. The
> company has also had business restructuring during the year under
> consideration thereby giving rise to extraordinary circumstances. For all
> these reasons we direct the Assessing Officer to exclude this company as a
> comparable.
(emphasis provided) 15.3. Accordingly in the light of the findings available
on record, we find that the prayer to exclude Accentia Technologies Ltd. on
these facts cannot be allowed as functional profile as per record has been
held to be that of a KPO. The judicial precedent as laid down in the case of
Rampgreen Solutions which holds that a KPO cannot be said to be comparable to
a low end IT enabled service provider is not of  Page 35 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 any help to the assessee as per facts on record. The fact
that the assessee's Financial and Accounting Support Service Segment as per
record has been held to be a high end KPO has not been assailed by any
argument or ground in the present proceedings as the Ld.AR has straight away
proceeded to address the comparables without first addressing the functional
profile. Reliance placed on precedent where the assessee's profile was taken
as low end ITeS and not a high end KPO as in the case at hand is of no help.
The finding of facts arrived at on record has not been assailed by way of any
argument.
15.4. Similarly we find that the arguments for exclusion of Eclerx Services
Ltd. in the face of the functional profile qua this segment of the assessee as
that of a high end KPO remaining unassailed on record. We find that reliance
placed on the decision of the Jurisdictional High Court in the case of
Rampgreen Solutions is not of much help. A KPO is understood as the higher end
of ITeS in terms of value addition. ITeS encompasses a wide spectrum of
services that use Information Technology based delivery which could include
rendering highly technical services by qualified technical personnel involving
advanced skills and knowledge, such as engineering, design and support.
Whereas on the other end of the spectrum ITeS would also include voice based
call centres that render routine customer support for their clients as were
the facts before the Hon'ble High Court. In view thereof, we find that the
prayer of the assessee cannot be allowed. 15.5. Considering the arguments for
and against the exclusion of TCSE Service Ltd. we find that nothing has been
brought on record by the Revenue in order to rebut the precedent that the
association of the said comparable with Tata brand  Page 36 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 has impacted its bargaining power to negotiate premium
contracts and thus established functional dissimilarity. In the absence of any
rebuttal on facts and considering the judicial precedent cited and considering
the copy of the Annual Reports which are found on record the comparable is
directed to be excluded.
16\. Addressing IT infrastructure Support Services Segment the Ld. AR has
submitted that the assessee is stated to be a captive service provider and
engaged in provision of various services in the nature of software and
hardware support services, network services, infrastructure management,
routine software development and monitoring and managing various IT components
such as servers, networks, storage equipment, messaging etc for the
requirements of AEs. 16.1. The original search carried out by the taxpayer in
its TP study by using multiple year data was objected to by the TPO. The
assessee was required to carry out a fresh search wherein all the 5
comparables proposed by the assessee were rejected on the grounds of
functional dissimilarity. The TPO accordingly proposed 19 comparables having
average OP/ TC of 23.55%.
17\. The comparables selected by the TPO were retained by the DRP leading to
the grievance posed before the Tribunal seeking exclusion of the following 7
comparables :-
          (i)      Infosys Ltd.;
          (ii)     Wipro Technolgoy Services Limited;
          (iii)    Acropetal Technologies Limited (Information Technology Service);
          (iv)     Sankya Infotech Ltd.(seg);
          (v)      Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd.;
          (vi)     E-Infochips India Pvt. Ltd.; and
          (vii)    E-Zest Solutions Ltd.
                                                                                 Page 37 of 50
                                                                   I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
18\. A perusal of the synopsis filed shows that the inclusion of Sankya
Infotech Ltd.(seg) and Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. is objected to
before the ITAT for the first time as no reference to the objections before
the DRP has been made. The exclusion of the remaining 5 has been sought on the
grounds which we propose to address separately hereunder:-
(i) Infosys Ltd is sought to be excluded on the grounds that it has brand
profits and owns significant tangibles; that there is significant expenditure
on research and development for developing new products and innovative
technology; that there is significant advertisement and marketing expenditures
resulting in non-routine marketing intangibles; ownership of
branded/proprietary products like Finacle; Infosys Active Desk, ;Infosys
iProwe; Infosys mConnect and diversify product portfolio; incomparable scale
of operations the various grounds on the basis of which the said comparable
has been rejected in various rulings of the ITAT.
(ii) The exclusion of Wipro Technologies Services Ltd. is sought on the
grounds of extraordinary circumstances resulting on account of an overall
business deal when Citi Technology Services Ltd was acquired by Wipro Ltd
during January 2009 as a result of which Wipro Ltd signed a Master Service
Agreement with Citigroup for the delivery of services for a period of 6 years
with guaranteed Revenue of US dollars 500 million. Accordingly, it has been
argued that regardless of the cost incurred/services performed by WTI is
minimum guaranteed revenue of US dollars 500 million has to flow from
Citigroup companies to WTS which it has been stated can lead to abnormally
high profit margins for WTS. Accordingly the  Page 38 of 50 I.T.A
.No.-6779/Del/2015 business model of WTS was stated to be very different from
that of the taxpayer and hence it was stated to be in comparable. Reliance has
been placed on various decisions of the ITAT for its exclusion.
(iii) Acropetal Technologies Ltd.'s exclusion has been sought on the ground
that it fails employee cost to total cost filter which is stated to be less
than 25% and employee cost ratio in this case is 15.30%. The said prayer it
has been stated was before the DRP also.
(iv) Exclusion of Sankhya Infotech Ltd is sought on the grounds that it is
functionally different as it is engaged in e-learning activities and training
solutions and it is also stated that the company is engaged in development as
it is engaged in development of simulation and virtual training products.
Reliance again has been placed upon Integral Decision and Systems India (P.)
Ltd. vs DCIT [TS-629- ITAT-2011 (Jpr)]; and NTT Data India Enterprise
Application Services Pvt.Ltd. vs ACIT [TS-293-ITAT-2013 (Hyd.)]. However, no
effort to demonstrate that facts qua the precedent and the assessee were pari-
materia were made.
(v) Exclusion of Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd, reliance was placed
again on the orders of the ITAT including Motorola's Solutions India Private
Limited versus ACIT (48 taxman.com 248) on the grounds that it was
functionally different as the company is engaged in rendering testing,
satellite communication and different services. Further the company was stated
also to be engaged in production of software products and also incurring
significant marketing and advertisement expenses unlike the assessee.
Page 39 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
(vi) Exclusion of E-InfoChips India Private Limited was sought on the ground
that it had diversified services which included application software; e-
commerce; mobility; BI and visualisation; firmware and system software; broad
design; ASIC/SOC/FPGA services; mechanical and industrial design. It was also
stated that segmental data was also not available, these submissions were
stated to be filed before the DRP also.
(vii) Exclusion of E-Zest solutions has been requested on the ground that it
is functionally dissimilar having diversified services like product
engineering services outsourced product development services which includes
product designing and development product feature enhancement, product
platform migration software product testing license and judgement etc. The
exclusion of the said comparable was also supported by placing reliance on
various orders of the ITAT and the submissions filed before the DRP.
18.1. The Ld. AR has submitted that in case the prayer of the assessee is
accepted and the 7 comparables as requested are excluded then the OP/TC of the
following remaining 12 comparables would be 15.50% and would be well within
the OP/TC of 14.14% or 18.06% if redrawn segmental account is considered:-
          Sl.No.   Company Name                             WC adjusted OP/TC
          1.       Akshay Software Technologies Limited            2.68%
          2.       Celstream Technologies Private Limited         14.35%
          3.       Evoke Technologies Private Ltd.                 9.36%
          4.       Igate Global Solutions LTd.                    23.93%
          5.       Larsen & Turbo Infotech Ltd.                   19.50%
          6.       LGS Global Ltd.                                12.42%
          7.       Mindtree Ltd.                                  10.29%
          8.       Persistent Systems & Solutions Ltd.            22.24%
          9.       Persistent Systems Ltd.                        22.82%
          10.      R S Software (India) Ltd.                      17.16%
          11.      Tata Elxsi Ltd.                                12.94%
                                                                            Page 40 of 50
                                                                          I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015
          12.       Thirdware Solution Ltd.                                 18.30%
                    Mean                                                    15.50%
19\. The Ld.CIT DR relies upon the orders of the tax authorities and his stand
that micro differences in the comparables in a TNMM cannot be a ground for
exclusion. It was also his stand that TNMM pre-supposed a broad comparability
and a selection of fairly large number of comparable companies would address
the micro difference, if any.
20\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the material available on
record. We find that before we address the specific request it is appropriate
to first address the functional profit of the assessee qua the segment as per
record. The DRP as per internal page 47 and 48 have held the assessee to be a
KPO engaged in software development. The relevant finding standing unassailed
on record is reproduced hereunder:-

> 20.1. No challenge to this finding is available either by way of any ground
> or argument.
20.2. We find that the prayer for exclusion of Sankhya Infotech Ltd. and
Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd by the assessee has not been agitated
before the DRP and the arguments are being advanced by the assessee for the
first time. Accordingly in the absence of any objection from the Revenue for
agitating the issue for the first time, we deem it appropriate to restore the
issue back to the TPO to consider the objections on the basis of facts and
evidences and pass a speaking order in accordance with law after giving the
assessee a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
20.3. Addressing the arguments advanced for exclusion of the remaining 5
comparables, we find that the issue has been agitated before the DRP. We find
that the judicial precedent justifying the exclusion of Infosys Ltd. now is a
settled issue as ownership of brands and proprietary products makes the said
comparable an incomparable as the bargaining power for higher profits stands
accepted. No rebuttal either on facts or law qua the prayer for exclusion of
the said company has been advanced by the Revenue. Considering the facts and
arguments this comparable is directed to be excluded.
20.4. We find that exclusion of Wipro Technologies Ltd. has been requested on
the basis of judicial precedent wherein a Master Service Agreement between
CITI group with Wipro Technology guaranteeing minimum Revenue of US dollars
500  Page 43 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 million for six years has been
cited. The Ld.CIT DR has put up a spirited defense so as to argue how the
guarantee of minimum Revenue of 500 million US dollars can be said to impact
net profits as it only guarantees minimum work upto the extent agreed. It has
been his argument that minimum guarantee of a specific amount of Revenue is a
matter of fact and how it can impact pricing so as to impact net profitability
has to be established and without the said exercise it can not be excluded in
a method like TNMM. This facet it was argued needs to be established.
Considering the overall factual matrix and the precedent cited, we deem it
appropriate to restore the issue to the TPO the assessee may demonstrate its
claim on facts as whether the aspect has been considered in its entirety in
the precedent cited has not been addressed by the parties. 20.5. The exclusion
of Acropetal Technologies, we find has also been agitated before the DRP. The
assessee has argued high turnover as a ground for its exclusion. The DRP
relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Chrys Capital has
held that the Hon'ble high Court explaining the decision rendered in Agnity
India Technologies Pvt.Ltd. has concluded that profits are not dependent on
high turnover and the said position has not been controverted. Before us the
exclusion, we find is not sought on this ground and exclusion of the said
comparable has been sought on the ground that it fails the employee cost
filter of 25% as the employee cost ratio is stated to be 15.30%. We find that
this factual aspect has not been argued before the DRP. Accordingly it is
deemed appropriate to restore the issue back to the TPO to consider the facts
on record qua the fresh line of argument advanced by the assessee as
admittedly the  Page 44 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 correctness of the
facts relatable to this argument have not been tested either by the TPO or the
DRP. Since the argument has not been advanced the occasion to consider the
correctness of the same obviously had not arisen. The issue is restored back
to the TPO for fresh adjudication.
20.6. The exclusion of E-Infochips India Pvt.Ltd. we find was sought before
the DRP on the ground that it failed the service income filter. The said claim
on facts was found to be incorrect. Annual Report was referred to by the DRP
which showed that sale from software product was only 15% and the financials
of the company were thus taken at the entity level as the filter of 25% was
found to be not crossed. Accordingly, we find that the assertions made in the
synopsis that segmental data is not available is found to be incorrect. On
facts no argument establishing that facts in the judicial precedent cited are
identical have been advanced. The comparable is directed to be retained. 20.7.
The facts for exclusion of E-Zest Solutions show that the DRP at pages 315 to
316 (internal pages 53 & 54) has upheld the finding of the TPO and held that
the said company is predominantly engaged in software development services.
This finding has not been rebutted by the assessee and nothing in support of
the argument that it is functionally dissimilar has been placed before us. The
comparable accordingly is directed to be retained.
21\. The conclusions arrived at have been based on the facts and arguments as
placed before the Bench. The conclusions arrived at have been based on
admitted facts on record and the specific reasoning for agreeing or
disagreeing with the arguments of the parties have been addressed as the
issues are fact driven and  Page 45 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 judicial
precedent referred to where facts are not identical though have been
considered but reference thereto is refrained from as the conclusions on the
issues are fact based, fact driven and fact-ridden.
22\. Although, we have already addressed the issue of redrawing the segmental
and the issue considering the submissions of the parties has been restored.
However, we note that the assessee before us has argued that the reimbursement
of expenses received has been routed through the P&L account. It has been
submitted that the assessee has merely acted as an intermediary between the
AEs and the service providers for the administrative convenience and no
services have been provided by the assessee in this respect. Reliance has been
placed upon the judicial precedent that service providers need not apply a
mark-up on reimbursement of expenses received, which are paid to third
parties:-
> NTT Data FA Insurance Systems (India) Private Limited (I.T.(TP).A
> No.1311/Bang/2010) M/s FCG Software Services (India) Pvt.Ltd. [IT(T.P)A
> No.1242/Bang/2012] M/s Cognizant Technology Solutions India PVt.Ltd. [ITA
> No.114 & 2100/Mds/2011] HSBC Electronic Data processing India Ltd. [ITA
> No.247/Hyd/2014] LG Soft India Pvt.Ltd. [IT(TP) No.1121/Bang/2011] Tesco
> Hindustan Service Centre Pvt.Ltd. [IT(TP).A.
No.1317/Bang/2010] 22.1. Without prejudice to the main argument that segmental
account prepared in the TP study is appropriate the assessee has requested
that the TPO may be directed in the alternate if the assessee fails in its
main prayer to consider the revised allocation methodology in the case of IT
Infra and FAS segment. According to the chart placed in the synopsis page 27,
it should be modified as under:-  Page 46 of 50
I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 S.No. Particulars EDS FAS IT Infra support segment
segment service segment
1\. As per TP study 10.84% 10.52% 14.32%
\- Considering provisions & liabilities written back as operating item
2\. As per TP study 10.69% 10.29% 14.14%
\- Considering provisions & liabilities written back as non-operating item
3\. Revised segmental profitability as per 8.98% 21.57% 18.06% Ld.TPO
\- Reallocating the expenses on the basis of revenue;
\- Including reimbursements in the revenue as well expenses; and
\- Considering provisions written back as non-operating item 22.2. As observed
the issue stands restored in the light of the request of the parties as the
TPO is found to have not carried out the direction of the DRP for which
purpose the Ld.CIT DR requested that it may be restored. The Ld.AR has
canvassed that the TPO may be directed to consider both the main as well as
the alternate arguments before 'him'. In view of the above the TPO is directed
to consider the issue afresh and pass a speaking order in accordance with law
after giving the assessee a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
23\. The assessee has also requested for economic adjustments on account of
risk adjustment across the comparables vide Ground No.1.5. The said prayer it
has been stated has been accepted in the case of assessee by the ITAT in
2004-05 and 2005-06 assessment years. The said issue accordingly is also
restored to the TPO directing him to consider the calculation's which the
taxpayer may provide for the comparables which are ultimately selected in the
fresh search carried out by  Page 47 of 50 I.T.A .No.-6779/Del/2015 the
parties in the EDA segment and qua the comparables retained in the remaining
two segments.
24\. Addressing the issue on account of receivables qua which Ground No. 5
read with No. 5.1 and 5.2 has been raised by the taxpayer, we find that
reliance has been placed upon the precedent as is available in assessee's case
in 2010 - 11 assessment year. Relying on the same it has been argued that the
adjustment on account of receivables has been stated to be deleted. It has
been submitted that the ITAT has held that the assessee is a debt free company
and that it is not justifiable to presume that borrowed funds would have been
utilized to pass on the facility to its AEs. It has been argued that the ITAT
relying on Kusum Healthcare Private Limited TS - 129 - ITAT 2015 (Del - TP)
has held that no separate adjustment is warranted on account of interest on
receivables. Accordingly, the taxpayer has placed the following contentions
before the ITAT:-
> • "The Appellant humbly submits that working capital adjustment undertaken
> takes into account the impact of outstanding receivables on the
> profitability and accordingly no separate adjustment is warranted on account
> of outstanding receivables. • The Appellant would also like to submit that
> the interest component is embedded in the sale price and commercial
> considerations needs to be appreciated i.e. to ensure a healthy relationship
> and to maintain a long business transaction, such compensation or charging
> of interest are being ignored commonly by business.
> • In this regard, the Appellant would like to place reliance on the recent
> ruling passed by Hon'ble Delhi ITAT in the case of Kusum Healthcare Private
> Limited (supra), wherein it was held that if the impact of the credit period
> was duly factored in the "working capital adjustment", while determining the

25\. The Ld.CIT DR relies upon the orders of the authorities below.
26\. Before considering the submissions of the parties, we first propose to
address the facts. It is seen that the issue has been considered by the TPO at
external page 88 to 113 and the issue has been summed up by the DRP's internal
pages 75 to 81 para 8.3 to 8.3.3. The DRP relying upon the decision of the
Jurisdictional High Court in CIT vs Cotton Naturals (I) Pvt. Ltd.
(2015-TII-09-HC- DEC-TP) on facts has restored the issue holding that neither
the currency in which the receivables is to be paid nor the computations of
the receivables have been provided. The TPO was directed to examine the facts
and ascertain the currency and consider the Agreement entered into by the
assessee with its AE in terms of the direction given at pages 80 and 81 of the
order. In view of the same, the issue is restored to the TPO to consider the
same and the facts as argued by the assessee before the ITAT in 2010-11
assessment year may be demonstrated to be in existence in the year under
consideration also before the TPO as reliance placed on Kusum Healthcare
Pvt.Ltd. qua the facts in the year under consideration also needs to be
established. Accordingly the issue is restored back with the above direction.
