76\. The existence of power is one thing; however to say that it has to be
used in one manner, is entirely another. The decision of the LOSC and the
final rejection by the SC took into consideration all circumstances, including
the previous judgments, the opinion of the Chief Legal Adviser, the DDA‟s
position about change of land use and also that no secondary school was
possible. Yet, the final decision of the SDMC was not to include the plots in
the Green Park Extension and construct residences. Besides use for school
purposes, conceivably, SDMC may explore other options for use of the plot for
some other public purpose or purposes, given the acute lack of open spaces in
the city for public amenities and utilities. In these circumstances, the
learned Single Judge was clearly in error in directing the SDMC to reconsider
the matter, in the manner he did, in the impugned judgment.
77\. In view of the foregoing findings, the appeal has to succeed; the
         S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
1\. The appellant (hereafter "SDMC") is aggrieved by a judgment dated
03.03.2016, allowing a writ petition bearing of the respondents (hereafter
"Garg"). Garg filed the writ petition and sought directions, to set aside the
decision dated 19.05.14 passed by the Lay Out Scrutiny Committee (hereafter
"LOSC") of SDMC; and to direct the SDMC to incorporate their (i.e. the
respondents) plots, (comprised in khasra no. 5, 6, and 14, village Yusuf Sarai
Jat now known as property no. K-28, Green park Extension, New Delhi) in the
layout plan of Green Park Extension colony, New Delhi. The Single Judge set
aside the order dated 19.05.2014 of the LOSC and the decision of the Standing
Committee (hereafter referred to as "SC") dated 17.07.2014, and directed the
SDMC to re-consider the inclusion of plot in Khasra Nos. 5, 6 and 14 ("the
plot" hereafter) at Village Yusuf Sarai Jat (K-
LPA No.369/2016 Page 1 of 58
28 Green Par Extension) in the lay out plan within a period of sixty days from
the date of the impugned judgment.
2\. Garg‟s claim was that the plot in measured 1600 sq. yds. is now known as
property no. K-28, Green park Extension; it was sold by M/s. Urban Development
Company Pvt. Ltd. to five people through registered sale deeds. During the
years 1975 to 1982, the officers of Municipal Corporation of Delhi(MCD) tried
to dispossess the erstwhile owners from their plots, a result of which, the
erstwhile owners filed five separate individual civil suits for permanent
injunction against MCD in Civil Court at Delhi. On 01.10.88, Sh.V.K. Malhotra,
Sub Judge, First class, Delhi, decided all the mentioned suits through five
separate judgements, whereby the erstwhile owners were held to be the owners
of their respective plots comprised in the said land.MCD was permanently
restrained from dispossessing them from the said plots. Five separate appeals
were filed against the said judgment before Sh. S.N. Dhingra, ADJ, Delhi, and
these appeals were dismissed by an order dated 21.03.1992.
3\. In 1994, the erstwhile owners sold the plot in question to some subsequent
buyers, Garg being one of them. The MCD again tried to take possession from
the subsequent buyers and on 03.05.1995 they preferred four individual
Contempt Petitions against the erring MCD officers in the Court of Civil
Judge, Delhi. The details of the contempt petitions filed are given below:
Contempt Filed by (subsequent buyer) Arising from suit Petition 20/95
SurindraKundra Suit no. 445/78 titled Vasudev Vs. MCD & others.
    LPA No.369/2016                                          Page 2 of 58
          22/95           Harish Kundra           Suit no. 183/78 titled Jagdish

                                                 and 116/80
         23/95             Roshan Lal            Suit no. 445-A/78 titled Prem
                                                 Nath Vs. MCD & others.
         24/95          Surinder Kumar           Suit no. 444/78 titled Govind
                                                 Ram Vs. MCD
4\. These contempt petitions were disposed of by orders dated 28.09.1995, the
MCD officers apologized for their „unintentional acts‟ of interference in the
possession of the suit property. The statements of the MCD officers was also
recorded by the court and apology was tendered by them.
5\. On 08.08.1996, the six subsequent buyers applied to the office of the MCD
to get their respective plots incorporated in the layout plan of Green Park
Extension. On 03.09.1997, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Land & Estate)
wrote to the Deputy Municipal Commissioner (south-zone MCD) referring to the
judgments in the civil suit and also the statements made by MCD officers in
the above mentioned Contempt Petitions; and sought clarification whether the
aforesaid land was MCD property or it was private property in the name of the
subsequent owners. On 13.01.1998, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) wrote
to the Secretary (Government of NCT of Delhi hereafter "NCT") that the land in
question was un- acquired by the DDA and the same had to be acquired for the
higher secondary school under emergency provisions of the land acquisition
act. The subsequent owners on 27.01.1998 wrote a letter to the Addl. Dy. Comm.
(L&E), MCD, submitting all their title deeds, the judgment in the civil suit,
contempt petitions and revenue records in support of their title on LPA
No.369/2016 Page 3 of 58 the said plots. The Addl. Dy. Comm. (L&E), MCD then
wrote a letter dated 20.07.1998 to the concerned Tehsildar to get the
demarcation/nishandehi of site in question. On 18.08.1998, the demarcation of
Khasra no.5, 6 & 14 was conducted by the concerned revenue officer in the
presence of MCD officers and submitted the report stating, inter-alia, that
the land in question fell in the concerned khasras.
6\. The MCD in its Resolution No.210 dated 19.08.1998, passed in a meeting of
the SC referred to the letter dated 13.01.1998 written by the Jt. Dir. (New
Leases), DDA to the Secretary, (Land & Bldg.) GNCTD urging that the land in
question had to be acquired for the higher secondary school under the
emergency provisions of the land acquisition act. Reference was further made
to the letter dated 20.07.1998 from the Addl. Dy. Comm. (L&E) to the Tehsildar
to get demarcation of the site in question. The LOSC on the report from the
DDA recommended the same to the SC for rejection. The SC Committee then
resolved that the incorporation of 6 residential plots on the plots in the
layout plan of Green Park Extn. be rejected as proposed. The Standing
Committee however noted that the revenue authorities had verified the
ownership in favour of the respondents herein and the Tehsildar had further
informed the MCD in 1997 that the land in question had not been notified for
acquisition. The Standing Committee nonetheless rejected the proposal to
incorporate the land in the lay out plan on the basis of DDA‟s 13.01.1998
letter.
7\. It was contended in the writ petition that in an office noting dated
11.12.1998, the Deputy Law Officer (DLO-HQ) of MCD observed various things
about the land in question. He observed that even though the land had been
earmarked for the MCD school park in the layout plan of Green Park Extension
and the MCD had obtained appropriate sanction from the corporation for
acquisition of the land for public purpose as earmarked in LPA No.369/2016
Page 4 of 58 the layout plan and that reference had been made to the Govt. of
NCT of Delhi for initiating acquisition proceedings. The record on the file
showed that neither the sanction for acquisition of land had been obtained
from the corporation nor any acquisition proceedings had been initiated to
acquire the said piece of land for public purpose. In the abovementioned
noting, the DLO-HQ (MCD) further observed that even if the title or ownership
of the applicants was accepted or not, the unassailable and admitted position
as per law was that the applicants were the owners of the Land in dispute.
Garg again requested for the incorporation of the land in question in the
green park layout plan by his letter dated 17.09.1999, on the ground that no
acquisition proceedings had been carried out.
8\. The Additional Town Planner (first respondent in the writ petition "ATP"
hereafter) through letter dated 04.11.1999 requested DDA to send its report
regarding acquisition of the land in question as the latter had communicated
to the MCD that it required the said land for the purposes of building a
school. On this basis, the proposal for carving out six residential plots was
rejected by the SC on 19.08.1998 by Resolution No. 210.The DDA replied to the
ATP‟s letter on 14.08.2000; it inter alia stated that:
> "... as per the report received from the Lands Deptt. Of DDA, Khasra no. 5,
> 6 and 14 have not yet been acquired by DDA.
> Further as per land use plan of MPD-2001, the land under reference has been
> indicated for residential use. As per the approved zonal plan of Zone F, the
> land is a part of proposed Sr. Sec. School. As per MPD-2001, the minimum
> area required for the Sr School is 4(1.6 ha) acre and the available land is
> inadequate for school.
> On part of this proposed school land, a layout plan for residential plot has
> already been approved by MCD, and now on balance un-acquired land, the
> proposal is to carve out plots, instead of school. If any modification is
> carried out in the layout LPA No.369/2016 Page 5 of 58 plan, MCD would like
> to put up detailed proposal for change of land use in approved zonal plan.
> As the subject area is under jurisdiction of MCD, modification/approval in
> the layout plan lies with MCD."
9\. Another letter dated 08.09.2000 was sent by the ATP, MCD to DDA for
clarification with regard to the land in question. DDA sent another letter
dated 17.01.2001 to the Chief Town Planner (hereafter referred to as "CTP").
The relevant part of that letter states:
> "1.Khasra no. 5, 6 and 14 of village Yusuf Sarai as per report of the Land
> Deptt. Dt. 6.12.99 have not been acquired.
> 2\. As per MPD 2001, the land under reference has been indicated as
> residential where as per approved Zonal Plan of Zone F, the site under
> reference along with its adjoining land is indicated for Sr. Sec. School.
> 3\. It is not sure as to how MCD has approved carving out of residential
> plots on the un-acquired surrounding land, which was meant for Primary and
> Sr. Sec. School even in Zonal Development Plan of earlier Zonal Plan of F.
> 4\. The record of this office shows that no letter has been issued to MCD
> regarding allotment of lesser are for school sites. However if received in
> your office, a copy of the same be sent.
> 5\. It is advisable to use the area as per the provision of MPD- 2001 and
> Zonal Plan.
> Further if any modification is required in approved Zonal Plan MCD would
> like to put up detailed proposal for change of use."
10\. MCD‟s position, in its counter-affidavit in W.P. (C) 4788/2000 (Green
Park Extn. Residents Association v. Union of India & others)was that the areas
which fell under its control were maintained as per the regularization plan
except for the pocket as now shown as 'others land' (land in question) and
that too for the reason that the owners of the said land LPA No.369/2016 Page
6 of 58 had filed civil suits against the MCD and as the civil courts declared
them to be owners of these plots of land, it had been restrained from
dispossessing or interfering from the peaceful possession of such persons.
11\. MCD‟s LOSC decision dated 28.10.2002 opined that the application for
carving out 7 plots be agreed to and it be put up to standing committee for
approval only after obtaining proper clearance from DDA. The writ petitioners
relied on this to say that the LOSC approved the proposal, subject to approval
from the DDA. In view of the decision of the LOSC, the ATP again sought
clarification from the DDA through his letters dated 18.12.2002 and
05.10.2005.In 2006-2008, the said land was transferred to the first, second
and third respondents through gift deeds and sale deeds. The first respondent
continued to be in possession of 250 sq. yds. of the land as the same was
bought by him in 1994.
12\. The owners of the lands (with particulars ) is set out in a tabular
chart, below:
          Name                  Number of plots        Area of plot
                                                       (in sq. yds.)
          Respondent no. 1                2            400+250
          Respondent no. 2                1            300
          Respondent no. 3                4            100+150+150+200
13\. In a letter dated 24.01.2011 written by the DDA to the CTP, MCD the DDA
wrote:
> "In this regard it is further submitted that as per provisions of MPD-2021
> Sr. Secondary School and the primary school is a layout level facility and
> is to be shown in the layout plan and not in the Zonal Plan. DDA has adopted
> the large Scale Land acquisition & disposed policy for Urban Development and
> the land under reference is a privately owned. Since the area is LPA
> No.369/2016 Page 7 of 58 under the jurisdiction of MCD therefore MCD may
> take appropriate action.
14\. Consequently, DDA again placed the onus on MCD to decide with regard to
incorporating the land in question in the layout plan.
15\. The respondents/writ petitioners wrote various letters to the CTP to
expedite the said matter however, there was no reply. Hence, were constrained
to move a complainant dated 13.8.2013 in this regard before the Public
Grievance Commission (PGC), NCT of Delhi. On 30.08.2013, ATO wrote to the PGC
wherein he stated that in view of the letter dated 24.01.2011 of the DDA, the
matter was being referred to the LOSC for its consideration. The respondents
alleged that through letter dated 24.12.2013, the MCD for the first time in 18
years alleged that the land in question stood transferred to it in 1969 itself
and that it was registered in the IP register of the Corporation. The ATP also
made reference to the court case in which the Town Planning Dept. was not made
a party to and also revealed from a letter of L&E Dept., written to DC (South
Zone), they were also not aware of the court decision or its applicability. In
the same letter, the matter was advised to be put up before the LOSC and after
the recommendation of the LOSC, before the SC. A comprehensive reply was given
to the said letter by the respondents herein. A complaint dated 09.04.2014 was
then made to the LG, NCT Delhi as there was no decision with regard to the
incorporation of the said land in the layout plan of Green Park Extension. A
status report was filed by two officers of the MCD (ATP and the second
respondents in the writ petition):
> "The Town Planning Deptt. was addressing another case of Plot No.K - 28,
> which was earmarked for a Mandir in the layout plan (F/G), Since such
> facility sites are handed over to MCD and the sites are taken in possession
> on behalf of by L&E Deptt. of MCD, LPA No.369/2016 Page 8 of 58 A reference
> was made to L&E Deptt. wherein the L&E Deptt. enclosed copies of records
> showing the large area including the land of these plots handed over to MCD
> in 1969 by the colonizer. The land as handed over to MCD is shown in green
> colour in the enclosed plan (F/H). The entry of the land in the I.P.
> Register of L&E Deptt. Has also been made available and the same is also
> attached along with the plan of the site. The sale documents of the present
> owners also show that this land was purchased from the colonizer.
> The report as received form the L&E Deptt. has also been made available to
> PGC, where the application was filed by the applicant.
> In view of the report of L&E Deptt. of MCD that the land was ' handed over
> to MCD in 1969, the legal opinion was sought and C.L.O. opined that "the
> record forwarded by L&E Branch established that the land was transferred to
> MCD in the year 1969 and it is registered in the I.P. Register of the
> Corporation. The map as enclosed in the fiel does not leave any doubt that
> it is MCD property, though encroached, which is shown in the green colour.
> It is also stated that the T.P. Deptt. is dependent on the reports of
> outside Departments like Revenue Deptt. of GNCTD LAC, DDA, L&DO and the L&E
> Deptt, of Corporation on the issue of ownership. The decision is taken by
> the Committee called as Layout Scrutiny Committee (LOSC) which recommends
> the case either for approval or rejection to the Standing Committee on
> merit. This Committee is chaired by Addl. Commissioner, Incharge of Engg.
> Deptt. LOSC cannot recommend any case for approval where land is claimed by
> a Deptt. of MCD.
> The report as above is submitted, please."
16\. The first respondent in the writ petition (i.e. the ATP) informed the PGC
by letter dated 05.08.2014 that the matter was rejected by LOSC. In response
to respondents‟ RTI application, Town Planning Department (MCD) supplied a
copy of the decision of LOSC dated 19.05.2014 to them.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 9 of 58
17\. The case of the MCD/SDMC is that the colony in question i.e. Green Park
Extension was originally approved by SC in 1958 by Resolution No. 07 dated
03.09.1958. Subsequently, a revised layout plan showing certain modifications
and increase in number of plots was approved vide Resolution No. 10 dated
28.03.1959 passed by the SC. That subsequently a demarcation layout plan
including the combined layout plan of shopping centre of Green Park Main and
Extension colonies was approved vide Resolution No. 183 dated 30.05.1969. The
said Resolution stated that no new plots would be allowed to be carved out.
The condition as incorporated in the said Resolution is reproduced as follows:
> "1. No new plots are allowed to be carved out. If the colonizer is, however,
> already committed in respect of newly carved out plots, he should surrender
> the alternative plots in lieu of the same."
18\. The SDMC stated that possession of open spaces earmarked for community
services such as parks, schools, dispensaries, community centre plots and
public building in terms of the approved layout plan were taken over by the
Municipal Corporation from the colonizer, i.e., M/s. Urban Improvement Company
(Pvt.) Ltd. on 04.12.1968. Subsequently, the possession of all these sites was
handed over by the L&E Deptt., MCD to the respective departments on
24.03.1969. It is contended by the SDMC that the land in question is a part of
Municipal land vested in the Municipal Corporation and the same is duly
entered in the IP Register showing it as property of the MCD. It is alleged by
the SDMC that at the time of handing over the land in question, there were
hundred unauthorized jhuggies, a store of P&T Department and a tube well at
the site. There were encroachments on the land in question and the department
officials sought to remove the said encroachments.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 10 of 58
19\. The SDMC stated that records of MCD also suggest that a school had been
in existence on the land in question and Jain Shiksha Samiti acquired the
ownership on the basis of a 'Settlement Deed' dated 10.12.1959 where the
colonizer was also a party. The school had also furnished the documents which
go to establish that the MCD gave recognition to the primary department of the
school, way back in May, 1959. The documents relating to payment of salary to
the staff, bank accounts, meetings of the governing body and other
correspondence with the MCD/other statutory organizations go to establish the
existence of the school since 1954. It was further submitted that the
colonizer seemed to have played a trick on MCD while not indicating the proper
picture at the time of handing over the sites. This issue was taken up by
letter dated 11.11.1971 with the colonizer to explain the circumstances under
which said plot was sold by him to Jain School which was occupying the land at
site and simultaneously also transferred to MCD. No reply was received to the
same. The MCD did acknowledge that the foregoing facts posed a problem as to
whether they could lawfully claim the ownership of the land merely on the
basis of handing/taking over certificate, when the facts did establish that a
school was functioning at the site and at the relevant time, the ownership of
the land did not seem to be vesting in the colonizer while handing over the
possession to the MCD. It seems that while taking possession, the sites were
not inspected, otherwise, the question of the existence of the school being
observed in March, 1969, and not in December, 1968 would not have arisen.
20\. The occupants of the plots, the predecessor-in-interest of the
respondents, filed suits for perpetual injunction against erstwhile MCD in the
year 1975. Five suits were filed claiming that the persons therein were in
possession of the land in question. Those five suits were contested by the LPA
No.369/2016 Page 11 of 58 erstwhile MCD. It was clearly stated by the MCD that
the land in question was part of school cum park complex as per layout plan of
Green Park Extension. Encroachment removal action was taken by the MCD and
encroachment was removed from the land in question on 03.12.1975. However,
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents re-encroached the land. Action was
taken by the Municipal Corporation for removal of encroachment time and again
including in the year 1977. Through the judgment dated 01.10.1988, the suits
were decreed and erstwhile MCD was restrained from taking forcible possession
of the land in question.
21\. SDMC said that in 1996, the predecessors of respondents applied for
incorporation of 6 plots in Khasra Nos. 5, 6 and 14 in the layout plan of
Green Park Extension, submitting that they had purchased their respective
plots from the previous owners in the year 1994. That application was rejected
by the SC by Resolution No. 210 dated 19.08.1998. The case was again
considered in 2002; however approval was not given. The LOSC after
consideration, on 19.05.2014, recommended rejection of the respondents‟
application. The SC‟s Resolution No. 74 dated 17.07.2014, rejected the
application. That the respondents filed writ petition bearing W.P. (C) No.
5382/2014 before this Hon'ble Court with prayer for setting aside the decision
dated 19.05.2014 passed by the LOSC with further prayer for directing the
Municipal Corporation to incorporate the plots of the respondents comprised in
Khasra No. 5, 6 and 14, Village Yusuf Sarai Jat (property No. K-28, Green Park
Extension) in the layout plan of Green Park Extension Colony.
Findings of the learned Single Judge
22\. The learned Single Judge noted that the pleadings in the civil suits
before the concerned court which had sought injunction did not contain any LPA
No.369/2016 Page 12 of 58 averment on behalf of the SDMC that it was owner of
the property; there was no advertence to the IPA register even in the counter
affidavit in the previous writ petition - W.P.(C) 4788/2000. It was,
therefore, felt that the SDMC‟s position was an afterthought. Learned Single
Judge then noted that the communication on record with respect to
clarification regarding use also contained a discussion whether the land was
an MCD property whereby the DDA was told that it was not acquired by that
authority (MCD). The demarcation report of 1998 of the concerned Tehsildar was
also adverted to in respect of the plots. The impugned judgment then noted
that the issue was reopened in September 1999 for reconsideration when LOSC
finally rejected the request. Given all these circumstances, it was held that
the argument with respect to finality of the decision of the Supreme Court
dated 19.08.1999 was not tenable. Learned Single Judge then noticed that not
only were the MCD‟s appeals dismissed but even its officers apologised in
contempt proceedings. A reference was also made to the Chief Legal Officer‟s
opinion of 1998, stating that the lands belonged to the predecessors of the
writ petitioners and not to the MCD. It was noted that even the Standing
Committee meeting of 19.08.1998 stated that, "the land had not been notified
for acquisition at that time."
23\. It was stated that the SDMC‟s position emerged for the first time with
respect to the LOSC‟s decision of 19.05.2014, which was approved by the SC on
17.07.2014, that it was neither communicated to the writ petitioner nor was
any averment made in that regard in the counter affidavit. The court then went
on to hold as follows:
> "35. The Court has power to mould the relief according to the demand of the
> situation to do complete justice between the parties. Thus, the petition
> cannot be rejected merely on the ground that the petitioners have not
> challenged the decision of the Standing Committee. A similar view was also

24\. The learned Single Judge then quoted in extenso the opinion of the Deputy
Law Officer of the MCD by noting dated 11.12.1998 which unambiguously stated
that the writ petitioners‟ title to the land could not be questioned. Learned
Single Judge again quoted extensively from the relevant portions of the MCD‟s
affidavit dated 11.12.2000 which stated that the Corporation had been
restrained from dispossessing the peaceful possession of the owners and then
went on to conclude as follows:
> "42. Further, in the counter affidavit filed in WP(C) No.4788 of 2000 by the
> MCD, it clearly admitted as under:- "......It is further humbly submitted
> and stated that the areas which fell under the control of MCD are being
> maintained as per the regularization plan except for the pocket as now shown
> as „others land‟ and that too for the reason that owners of the said land
> have filed civil suits against the MCD and the civil courts declared them
> (owners) to be the owners of these lands and the MCD has been restrained
> from dispossessing or interfering from peaceful possession of these persons"
> (Para 3) ......This particular alleged K-28 is a part of others land shown
> in the layout plan of the Town & Planning Department of MCD" (Para 11) The
> erstwhile owners purchased the land in question from Urban Improvement Co.
> P. Ltd. in the year 1975 vide duly registered sale deeds. The property was
> in their possession. The sale deeds submitted by the petitioners or the
> erstwhile owners to the MCD were never questioned by the MCD.
> 43\. A perusal of the communications between the MCD and DDA also reveal

> modification/approval of the layout plan lies with MCD as the area was under

> 44\. The petitioners had to fight for a number of years even to get rights

Contentions of the parties
25\. Sh. Sanjay Poddar, learned senior counsel, appearing for the SDMC
highlighted that the plots comprised in the three Khasra Nos. are the subject
matter of the proceedings of which original lay out plan was submitted by the
coloniser and approved by the Standing Committee on 03.09.1958. A revised lay
out plan was approved on 28.03.1959 and the demarcation plan was approved on
30.05.1969 which specifically stated that no new plots are allowed to be
carved-out. It was submitted that the land in question was earmarked for
school. It was also stated that subsequent to the revised plan approval, the
coloniser in fact handed over the areas as a precondition for demarcation
prior to 1969, on 04.12.1968. Consequently, the MCD was LPA No.369/2016 Page
16 of 58 handed over the land which in turn handed over possession to the
respective department on 24.03.1963. It is stated in this context that the
entries were made in the IP Register in 1969. Learned counsel relied upon the
relevant entries in the IP Register, which stated as follows:
> "MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI LANDS & ESTATE DEPARTMENT No.E/L&E/68 Dated
> the November, 1968 The following services of Green Park Extension Colony as
> per approved layout plan have been taken over today the 4th December, 1968

LPA No.369/2016 Page 17 of 58
26\. It was next submitted that the suits filed between 1978 and 1982 by the
writ petitioners‟ predecessors were only to restrain the MCD from
dispossessing them. Undoubtedly, the MCD‟s appeals were dismissed and even the
second appeal was also dismissed by this Court. It is stated that the writ
petitioners‟ stand that all these resulted in possession of the predecessors
being perfected through adverse possession and that the title was perfected in
1994 with the execution of the five sale deeds in favour of the predecessors
is highly contentious and disputed. It is stated that concededly, even the
predecessors of the petitioners had initiated contempt proceedings which was
ultimately disposed of. The purchasers had also sought incorporation of the
plots in the lay out plan in 1996 which culminated in the rejection of that
application on 19.08.1998 through Resolution No. 210. Another letter dated
17.09.1999 was triggered on account of the Deputy Commissioner‟s noting that
the land had not been notified for acquisition. This too was considered and
rejected by the LOSC on 19.05.2014, which was approved by the SC on
17.07.2014.
27\. Counsel relied on the two documents, i.e. LOSC decision and the SC
resolution. They are extracted below:
> "DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION Copy of the proposal/issue No.210 of minutes of

> Park Extn, be rejected as proposed."
28\. The Resolution No.210 and 74 dated 17.07.2014 of the Standing Committee
are as follows:
LPA No.369/2016 Page 19 of 58
> "Item No.16 :- Incorporation of Residential Plots (6 Nos.) on Kh. No.5, 6
> and 14 in the layout plan of Green Park Extn.
> Resolution No.210 Resolved that in view of the position brought out by the
> Commissioner in his letter No.F.33/TP/498/C&C dated 20-7-98, incorporation
> of 6 residential plots on Khasra No.5, 6 and 14 in the layout plan of Green
> Park Extn., be rejected as proposed.
> South Delhi Municipal Corporation"
29\. Resolution No. 74 was identically worded- it was in respect of the 7
plots; it effectively rejected the proposal for incorporation of the plots in
the layout, as recommended.
30\. It is argued by Mr. Poddar, learned senior counsel that concededly in
terms of the lay out plan, the plots were earmarked for school. It is urged
that consequent by operation of Sections 312 and 313, the coloniser ceased to
be the owner and held the property or any residuary interest in it for the
benefit of the society in general of which the Corporation secured rights and
management as a custodian. Learned senior counsel relied upon Pt. Chet Ram
Vashist v. MCD 1995 (1) SCC 47. It was submitted that the limited and
restricted nature of the rights of the coloniser and the general public
interest in the land had to be considered. According to the counsel, the
coloniser‟s right was to hold the land for the benefit of the society, i.e.
other plot holders or the public in general and consequently, the right to
hold the land in trust for the specific purpose specified by the coloniser in
the sanctioned lay out plan and thirdly, the coloniser could not transfer the
land or use it for any other purpose or manner. It was stated that
correspondingly, the general public and those living in the neighbourhood had
acquired the easement rights that the land in question was used for the
purpose earmarked in the lay out plan: the school was constructed and lastly
LPA No.369/2016 Page 20 of 58 it was submitted that the MCD (now SDMC) is the
custodian of public interest and managed it in the best interest of the
society. Learned counsel also relied upon NDMC v. Prashant Narula & Ors. 2016
(160) DRJ 113 and furthermore, relied upon Real Estate Agencies v. State of
Goa and Ors. (2012) 12 SCC 170.
31\. Next, it was argued that the writ petitioners could not claim any
entitlement or modification of the nature of use as that would amount to
usurping or depriving the rights of the general public and the custodial
rights of the MCD. He relied upon the decision in State of Orissa v. Ram
Chandra Dev & Anr. AIR 1964 SC 685; Rajasthan State Industrial Development and
Investment Corporation v Subhash Sindhi Cooperative Housing Society, Jaipur
and Others (2013) 5 SCC 427 and urged that this Court should not grant relief.
32\. Learned counsel submitted that the impugned judgment was erroneous
because the learned Single Judge could not have, in the absence of any
entitlement or established right to own the land inuring to the petitioners‟
favour granted relief to it. Learned counsel strongly denied the petitioners‟
assertion that they were kept in the dark about the LOSC and the Standing
Committee‟s decision of 2014. It was submitted that the writ petitioners
sought to challenge the decision of the SC by an amendment application but it
was ultimately dismissed as not pressed. It was urged that the learned Single
Judge erred in holding that no interest vested in the Corporation since that
was clearly in ignorance of the binding authority of the Supreme Court in Pt.
Chet Ram Vashist (supra)and as possession of the land was handed over to MCD
on 04.02.1968. MCD- and SDMC‟s rights as custodian to manage the property in
the best interest of the property crystallized at that time. The subsequent
claim of title by trespassers was a mere illusion because the coloniser was
precluded from asserting any rights, LPA No.369/2016 Page 21 of 58 much less
in 1994 after the approval of the lay out plan, after it handed over of the
property in December 1968 (to the MCD) and its demarcation in 1969\. It was
urged next that the reliance on the principle of res judicata is misplaced
because the question of title was never centrally in issue nor was it
necessary for decision in the previous injunction suits. In this regard,
reliance was placed upon the rulings in Sajjadanashin Sayed Md. B.E. Edr. v.
Musa Dadabhai Ummer and Others (2000) 3 SCC 350; Williams v. Lourdusamy (2008)
5 SCC 647 and Syed Mohd. Salie Labbai (dead) By L.Rs and Others v. Mohd.
Hanifa (dead) By L.Rs and Others (1976) 4 SCC
780\.
33\. Mr. Sudhanshu Batra, learned senior counsel for the
respondents/petitioners urged this court not to interfere with the findings of
the Single Judge. He urged that the Single Judge correctly set aside order
dated 17.07.2014 of the SC which was never brought to the knowledge of the
writ petitioners nor to the knowledge of the court until the final arguments,
and did not even find mention in SDMC‟s counter affidavit. The order of
19.05.2014 passed by LOSC was the foundation of the order of the SC. The SC in
its order merely reproduced the order of the LOSC and added last two sentences
stating that the incorporation be rejected as proposed. Clearly, there was
non-application of mind.
34\. It is urged that in terms of Section 313(3), SC has to decide
applications made under Section 313(1) for incorporation within a period of 60
days. However, in the present case, SC did not decide the respondents'
application despite expiry of 18 years. The latter could not have waited for
an infinite period of time before filing the present writ petition, when 18
years had already lapsed and LOSC clearly recommended SC for rejection.
35\. Mr. Batra submitted that though the said 5 judgments granted relief of
permanent injunction, yet the last paragraph (relief paragraph) in each of LPA
No.369/2016 Page 22 of 58 5 judgments clearly states that relief of permanent
injunction had been granted on the basis of ownership and possession having
been proved by the plaintiffs in each case. Moreover, in one of the 5 suits, a
specific issue no.3 was framed, "whether the plaintiff is owner of the
disputed land", which was decided in favour of the plaintiff against the MCD
on the basis of evidence lead by the parties. It is argued that MCD did not
place any document regarding its ownership in any of the suits, not even the
alleged IP Register or the alleged possession letter. It did not reject the
respondent's application for incorporation on the ground of MCD's ownership
until 19.05.2014. On the contrary, MCD accepted the respondent's ownership on
the said land in its (i) SC Resolution No. 210 dated 19.08.1998; (ii) Counter
affidavit (para 11 thereof) dated 17.2.2001 filed in WP (C) 4788/ 2000;
(iii) LOSC decision dated 28.10.2002; (iv) the first page of LOSC order dated
19.05.2014. On the other hand, SDMC failed to prove its ownership or handing
over of possession to MCD by the colonizer or that the land was a part of
school cum park complex.
36\. In one of the civil judgments (Prem Nath vs. Municipal Corporation of
Delhi & others), specific issue no. 3 and 4 regarding ownership and possession
were framed, which were decided in favour of the respondents' predecessors and
against MCD. Therefore, MCD lost the said 5 suits and was restrained from
interfering in possession on the basis of ownership of the plaintiffs therein
having been proved through registered sale deeds. It was submitted that the
subsequent attempts by MCD to interfere in the possession, caused the
plaintiffs to file contempt petitions against it wherein its officers
apologized for interfering in possession. In contempt proceedings, the MCD
failed to show that it was owner of the properties.
37\. It is submitted that MCD entertained the respondents‟ application under
Section 313 and kept on acting and proceeding thereupon for last 20 LPA
No.369/2016 Page 23 of 58 years and never took a stand that the application
was not maintainable under the said section. SDMC's sole ground of rejection
of the application was on the basis of SDMC‟s ownership. Therefore, it cannot
now be allowed to take this plea that the application was filed under wrong
provision. Moreover, by its letter dated 30.11.2006, MCD rejected an
application dated 14.09.2006 for sanctioning building plans for a nursery
school on the alleged school land, stating that the land is not a part of
approved layout plan and asked to file fresh proposal for approval of layout
plan under Section 313 of the Act.
38\. It was urged that the earlier legal opinion of Law Officers of MCD in
year 1998 was based upon the judgments in the 5 civil suits, when no entry in
IP register was in existence. On the other hand, the legal opinion of the Law
officer in 2014 was based just on an entry in IP register, and no reference to
the judgments in the civil suits and contempt proceeding was made to the said
law officer. Thus, the opinion of Law officer in 2014 was obtained by
concealing material information regarding the judgment from him and hence, the
same was rejected by the learned Single Judge. This finding, therefore, is
reasonable and based on the record. It was stated that after the SC's order
dated 19.08.1998, the issue was reopened on an application made by Garg in
September, 1999 for reconsideration of case, which was finally rejected by
order of 19.05.2014, which itself stated that the matter was reopened on an
application of the said first respondent.
39\. It is emphasized that the MCD stated on oath in its counter affidavit
dated 17.02.2001, filed in another WP No. 4788/2000, that the said land was
owned by others and not by it (MCD). This was a clear admission of MCD, which
clearly established the ownership of the respondents. It is also submitted
that the Respondents could not have challenged earlier decision of SC dated
19.08.1998, because subsequent thereto the matter was LPA No.369/2016 Page 24
of 58 reopened on an application made by Garg in September, 1999 for
reconsideration of case, which was finally rejected by the LOSC and the SC in
2014. Counsel points out that the rejection of the application for
incorporation was based on the sole ground of ownership and not any other
ground, much less on the ground of land being earmarked for school as SDMC
contends now. Moreover, the land was not earmarked for School.
40\. Dealing with handing over of possession, it is submitted that MCD never
placed any document to that effect. The letter dated 04.12.1968, related to
handing of only the services and not possession. Reliance is placed on one of
the suits (Prem Nath v Municipal Corporation of Delhi &Ors) a specific issue
no.4 was framed - "whether land was handed over to MCD by Colonizer", which
was decided against the defendant, MCD.
41\. The land was shown as part of the land earmarked for school in the
original layout plan, but the school land use was deleted in the revised
layout plan. It is stated that since MCD‟s second appeal was rejected, it does
not lie in the mouth of SDMC to say that the respondents are illegal
trespassers. It is argued that though the respondents‟ predecessors were
trespassers, their occupation of the land were regularized through separate
sale deeds, executed and registered in 1994. Furthermore, the unauthorized
occupation, if any was only against the colonizer and not the MCD or SDMC.
Also, the colonizer executed the sale deeds in 1975 only after deletion of
school land use from the layout plan in the year 1969; and authorizing the
then part of school land for residential plots by MCD in 1974\. It is clear
that the land is under ownership and possession of the respondents who hold
valid and legal title. Moreover, after the land use of school was deleted, it
ceased to be even earmarked to be a public land.
42\. It is urged that the established law is that if the issue was 'necessary'
to decide for adjudicating on the principal issue, and is decided, it would
LPA No.369/2016 Page 25 of 58 have to be treated as 'directly and
substantially' in issue and if it is clear that judgment was in fact based
upon that decision, then it would be res judicata in a latter case. Thus, for
the civil court it was necessary to decide the issue of ownership for
adjudicating the principal issue of possession and therefore, the issue of
ownership was "directly and substantially" an issue and not collaterally.
Therefore, res judicata was applicable against MCD in writ petition.
43\. Mr. Batra submitted that the Master Plan and Zonal development plans fall
in the realm of DDA; which has made it clear in its letter dated 14.08.2000
and dated 24.01.2011 that the matter falls in the jurisdiction of MCD alone
and not DDA.
44\. It was argued that the writ petitioners/respondents did not urge any
disputed question of facts. The issues regarding ownership and title were
previously proved in favor of the respondents' predecessors in above said five
suits. The respondents do not seek the ownership or title to be decided by
this Court, but they are merely relying upon those judgments. It is submitted
that the dispute regarding ownership was raised by SDMC for the first time in
their letter dated 24.12.2013. Before that, MCD had been accepting the
respondents' ownership in its LOSC decisions dated 28.10.2002 and 19.05.2014;
and its counter affidavit dated 17.02.2001 (para
11) in CWP No.4788/2000.
45\. Lastly, Mr. Batra relied on the response to an RTI application with
respect to the land in question, SDMC provided information by letter dated
19.12.2016,where:
(a) It stated that the copy of order on which the entry of IP register was not
available in the record;
(b) It also provided office noting, in which its DLO has questioned the legal
sanctity of the IP register and has pointed to the contemptuous nature of LPA
No.369/2016 Page 26 of 58 SDMC's stand of its ownership claim over the land,
which it has disowned in its Counter Affidavit filed in the previous writ
petition; the DLO further opined that complete true facts need to be verified
and brought on record to avoid an embarrassing position in the court. He also
stated that it was apparent that some officials are playing dubious role,
which needed to be checked. Actual facts need to be verified and action needs
to be taken against erring officers, while bringing correct facts on court
record, it is worth noting that disciplinary proceedings were initiated
against Mr. Bharat Bhushan Gupta in this connection, who has signed the
present LPA without having been authorized in this regard.
Analysis and conclusions:
46\. On an overall consideration of the findings of the learned Single Judge
and having regard to the submissions of the parties, the question which this
Court has to decide are:
> (i) firstly, whether the findings of the five previous suits are conclusive
> on the issue of title - alive to it is the RV sale deeds executed by the
> coloniser in favour of the writ petitioners‟ predecessors in 1994;
> (ii) Secondly, whether the communication by the DDA that the Master Plan -
> and the consequential Zonal Development Plan requirements no longer
> stipulated that the land was needed for a secondary school and, therefore,
> consequently, the SDMC could change the purpose to residential. Alive to
> this is the nature of the MCD‟s obligations to carry out the necessary
> correction in the layout plan.
> (iii) The third would be the interpretation of Sections 312 and 313 of the
> Act, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in Pt.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 27 of 58
> Chet Ram Vashist (supra) etc. and whether the MCD is correct in asserting
> that it has the right to manage the property as its custodian.
> (iv) Lastly, whether the issue of title - in the light of the contentions of
> the parties has to be decided in favour of the writ petitioners.
47\. Before proceeding with the analysis of the submissions, it would be
necessary to extract the relevant provisions of the DMC Act, 1957 (i.e. "the
Act"). They are as follows:
> "312. Owners, obligation when dealing with land as building sites "If the
> owner of any land utilises, sells, leases out or otherwise disposes of such
> land for the construction of buildings thereon he shall lay down and make a
> street or streets giving access to the plots into which the land may be
> divided and connecting with an existing public or private street.
                     ************                              ************
             313. Lay-out plans
> (1) Before utilising, selling or otherwise dealing with any land under

48\. The first and fourth points would be taken up together, as they concern
the same issue. It would be essential to set out the facts relating to the
five suits filed by the writ petitioners‟ predecessors. In Prem Nath v Hans
Raj, (Suit No. 620/1995 before the Senior Sub Judge), the plaintiff claimed
ownership of the land by virtue of the sale deed in his favour executed by the
Urban Improvement Company. He claimed to be in possession for over 19 years
and conceded that since transfer of property could not be made on account of
impediment in law, effect was given to the agreement to sell by granting him
possession. The suit claimed injunction on the basis of continued possession
and alleged threat of dispossession by the erstwhile MCD. Similar assertions
were made by all the plaintiffs‟ predecessors. According to the writ
petitioners, the five original predecessors in interest conveyed title or
interest in favour of six other individuals (including Pawan Garg).
Intervening transactions are also relied upon. The writ
petitioners/respondents in this case rely upon a flow chart depicting the
transfer of title at various times. The same is extracted below:

49\. Each of the suits filed - Govind Ram v. MCD Suit No.444/1978; Vasudev v.
MCD Suit No. 445/1978; Prem Nath v. MCD Suit No.445- A/1978; Jagdish Lal Batra
v. MCD Suit No.183/1978 and Pyare Ram v. DDA Suit No.714/1982, were decided on
the same day, i.e. 01.10.1998. A close look at the judgments of the trial
court reveal that findings were recorded with respect to ownership of
property. Yet, the reasoning is perfunctory and sketchy. Given the undoubted
backdrop of the principal claim to injunct him, being in possession rather
than ownership, the discussion necessarily was proved and in one sense a prima
facie  LPA No.369/2016 Page 31 of 58 conclusion. In these circumstances, the
court is of the opinion that the discussion and findings with respect to the
writ petitioners‟ ownership was not necessary for the decision on the main
issue, i.e. possession and threatened dispossession from the land.
50\. The judgment in Sajjadanashin (supra) points out that:
> "In India, Mulla has referred to similar tests (Mulla, 15th Ed.p.104). The
> learned author says: A matter in respect of which relief is claimed in an
> earlier suit can be said to be generally a matter „directly and
> substantially‟ in issue but it does not mean that if the matter is one in
> respect of which no relief is sought it is not directly or substantially in
> issue. It may or may not be. It is possible that it was ‟directly and
> substantially‟ in issue and it may also be possible that it was only
> collaterally or incidentally in issue, depending upon the facts of the case.
> The question arises as to what is the test for deciding into which category
> a case falls? One test is that if the issue was ‟necessary‟ to be decided
> for adjudicating on the principal issue and was decided, it would have to be
> treated as ‟directly and substantially‟ in issue and if it is clear that the
> judgment was in fact based upon that decision, then it would be res judicata
> in a latter case. (Mulla, p.104) One has to examine the plaint, the written

> "It is not to be assumed that matters in respect of which issues have been

> foundation."
51\. More pointedly, in an elaborate analysis of the law on the subject, the
Supreme Court held in Ananthula Sudhakar v. P. Buchi Reddy (Dead) by LRs. &
Others 2008 (4) SCC 594 in the following manner:
> "15. In a suit for permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from
> interfering with plaintiff's possession, the plaintiff will have to
> establish that as on the date of the suit he was in lawful possession of the
> suit property and defendant tried to interfere or disturb such lawful
> possession. Where the property is a building or building with appurtenant
> land, there may not be much difficulty in establishing possession. The
> plaintiff may prove physical or lawful possession, either of himself or by
> him through his family members or agents or lessees/licensees. Even in
> respect of a land without structures, as for example an agricultural land,
> possession may be established with reference to the actual use and
> cultivation. The question of title is not in issue in such a suit, though it
> may arise incidentally or collaterally.
> XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX
> 21\. To summarize, the position in regard to suits for prohibitory
> injunction relating to immovable property, is as under :
> (a) Where a cloud is raised over plaintiff's title and he does not have
> possession, a suit for declaration and possession, with or without a
> consequential injunction, is the remedy. Where the plaintiff's title is not
> in dispute or under a cloud, but he is out of possession, he has to sue for
> possession with a consequential injunction. Where there is merely an
> interference with plaintiff's lawful possession or threat of dispossession,
> it is sufficient to sue for an injunction simpliciter.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 33 of 58
> (b) As a suit for injunction simpliciter is concerned only with possession,
> normally the issue of title will not be directly and substantially in issue.
> The prayer for injunction will be decided with reference to the finding on
> possession. But in cases where de jure possession has to be established on
> the basis of title to the property, as in the case of vacant sites, the
> issue of title may directly and substantially arise for consideration, as
> without a finding thereon, it will not be possible to decide the issue of
> possession.
> (c) But a finding on title cannot be recorded in a suit for injunction,
> unless there are necessary pleadings and appropriate issue regarding title
> [either specific, or implied as noticed in Annaimuthu Thevar (supra)]. Where
> the averments regarding title are absent in a plaint and where there is no
> issue relating to title, the court will not investigate or examine or render
> a finding on a question of title, in a suit for injunction. Even where there
> are necessary pleadings and issue, if the matter involves complicated
> questions of fact and law relating to title, the court will relegate the
> parties to the remedy by way of comprehensive suit for declaration of title,
> instead of deciding the issue in a suit for mere injunction.
> (d) Where there are necessary pleadings regarding title, and appropriate
> issue relating to title on which parties lead evidence, if the matter
> involved is simple and straight-forward, the court may decide upon the issue
> regarding title, even in a suit for injunction. But such cases, are the

> wrongfully makes a claim or tries to encroach upon his property. The court
> should use its discretion carefully to identify cases where it will enquire
> into title and cases where it will refer to plaintiff to a more
> comprehensive declaratory suit, depending upon the facts of the case."
52\. Thus, it is clear that the plea of res judicata in this case could not,
having regard to the surrounding circumstances of this case, precluded or
estopped the SDMC from questioning the writ petitioners‟ title to the lands.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 34 of 58
Sajjadanashin (supra) is an authority on the issue as to what constitutes a
matter directly and substantially in issue. The court clearly stated that
something which is necessary for a decision is directly and substantially in
issue and that which is inessential may result in findings which are not
conclusive of the matter. This principle appears to have been followed and
applied in Williams (supra). On the specific issue as to whether the evidence
concerning ownership and title, if gone into, would preclude further debate by
the parties, in the context of injunction suits and not those which seek the
establishment or declaration as to title, the judgment in Anathula Sudhakar
(supra) is categorical; it clearly holds that the suit for injunction
simplicitor is concerned with possession and issue of title will never be
directly and substantially in issue. The court went to say that even when that
issue does and there are necessary pleadings. Nevertheless, if the matter
involves complicated questions of fact and law, the court will relegate the
matter for remit by way of comprehensive suit for declaration.
53\. In the present proceedings, each plaintiff had asserted actual possession
of the property and not de jure possession or occupation. The suit was for
bare injunctive relief. In these circumstances, the decision on the question
of ownership or title could not be deemed to be conclusive.
54\. While on the subject it would be necessary also to deal with an argument
made repeatedly on behalf of the writ petitioners that the SDMC was precluded
from raising previous communication, internal notings as well as the opinion
of its Chief Legal Advisor that the corporation was precluded from questioning
the ownership of the writ petitioners or their predecessors in interest. In
this context, it is noteworthy that in Subhash Sindhi Co-operative
Society(supra), the Supreme Court observed as follows:
LPA No.369/2016 Page 35 of 58
> ..."Be that as it may, there can be no estoppel against the law or public
> policy. The State and statutory authorities are not bound by their previous
> erroneous understanding or interpretation of law. Statutory authorities or
> legislature cannot be asked to act in contravention of law.
> "13.....The statutory body cannot be estopped from denying that it has
> entered into a contract which was ultra vires for it to make. No corporate
> body can be bound by estoppel to do something beyond its powers, or to
> refrain from doing what it is its duty to do."
> Even an offer or concession made by the public authority can always be
> withdrawn in public interest. (Vide: State of Madras & Anr. v K.M.
> Rajagopalan AIR 1955 SC 817; Badri Prasad &Ors v Nagarmal & Ors. AIR 1959 SC
> 559; and Dr. H.S. Rikhy etc. v. The New Delhi Municipal Committee, AIR 1962
> SC 554). In Surajmull Nagoremull v Triton Insurance Co Ltd, AIR 1925 PC 83,
> it was held as under:
> "..No court can enforce as valid, that which competent enactments have
> declared shall not be valid, nor is obedience to such an enactment a thing
> from which a court can be dispensed by the consent of the parties or by a
> failure to plead or to argue the point at the outset..."
> A similar view was re-iterated by the Privy Council in Shiba Prasad Singh v
> Srish Chandra Nandi, AIR 1949 PC 297."
55\. In the light of the above discussion, it is held that the impugned
judgment to the extent it assumes that question of ownership and title were
conclusively determined in the previous suit by the Senior Sub judge and had
been endorsed in appeal and further on second appeal by this Court, is clearly
erroneous. It is also important to notice here that the appeal preferred
before the District Judge appears to have been time barred. That was the
primary ground for rejection of the application for condonation. The
consequent refusal by this Court to set aside the findings of the lower courts
on the ground that no substantial question of law arises was in no LPA
No.369/2016 Page 36 of 58 manner conclusive on the issue of title as well. For
these reasons, it is held that the Single Judge fell into error in accepting
the writ petitioners‟ plea that the question of title had been decided
affirmatively in favour of their predecessors in interest and that issue had
the effect of estopping SDMC from questioning their rights and interest over
the land, as subsequent transferees.
56\. On the second issue with respect to the LOSC‟s rejection in 2014 of the
request for re-examination of change of user and inclusion of the plots in the
lay out plan, both parties had relied upon a welter of documentary evidence.
The SDMC had relied upon the initial proposal of the coloniser, the draft
layouts, approval of lay out plan and the final demarcation in 1969; it
highlights that possession on the basis of the lay out plan was handed over to
it on 04.12.1968. The demarcation was carried out subsequently. This formed
the basis of its argument that the use of land was fixed and crystallized as a
public land although for the purpose of construction and use as a secondary
school. The writ petitioner/respondents, on the other hand made diverse
arguments. In the present context, the relevant arguments are that the issue
never attained finality because the ownership of the land remained with the
coloniser and was vested in the petitioner‟s predecessors in 1994. It was also
importantly argued, on 07.03.1974, a Resolution was passed dealing with
regularization of plan of the plots. It was urged that given these
circumstances, the SDMC‟s argument with respect to rejection of the request
for inclusion of lay out in the residential colony was untenable; the SC‟s
decision based on the LOSC recommendations has noted the previous decision of
19.08.1998 were based entirely on the ground of existing user of the property
or the alleged ownership of the suit land vesting in favour of the MCD.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 37 of 58
57\. In this case, the lay out plan was sanctioned in favour of the coloniser
on 03.09.1958. The revised plan submitted by the coloniser subsequently was
approved by the erstwhile MCD on 28.03.1959. That resolution considered the
revised lay out. The relevant parts of the resolution reads as follows:
> "No.7 Subject: Sanction of lay out plan of Green Park Extension on Mehrauli
> Road, by Urban Improvement Housing and Construction Co. (Private) Ltd.
> The applicant has submitted a layout plan for this area for the approval of

58\. On 04.12.1968, the possession of open spaces, including the land was
handed over to the erstwhile MCD. The document evidencing this reads as
follows:
> "MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI LANDS & ESTATE DEPARTMENT No.E/L&E/68 Dated

LPA No.369/2016 Page 39 of 58
59\. Apparently, the erstwhile MCD handed over possession of the properties in
turn to its respective departments for maintenance and development and made an
appropriate entry in its IPR, the extract of which has been produced; in fact
acting in furtherance, the demarcation report too was prepared, which reads as
follows:
> ....."Item No.7: - Demarcation Plan of Green Park Main and Extension on

62\. Upon an overall analysis of the documentary evidence, it is clear that no
commitment was ever held out in categorical terms that the vacant land
earmarked for purposes other than school or public use in the original lay out
plan would be later changed to residential purposes and also included in the
lay out plan. On the contrary, all documents clearly point to the fact that
the coloniser had sought revisions of the plans at least twice. The later,
conditionally granted amendments had clearly stated that the increase in
residential plots correspondingly meant shrinkage of public and green spaces.
Taking these circumstances into consideration, the repeated correspondence
which the MCD engaged in - likely on account of pressures of the local
residence samiti and perhaps at the behest of some officers of the corporation
for reasons that are not relevant, the DDA was approached on three occasions.
Each time, the DDA lobbed back the issue into MCD‟s court. The best that Garg
and the other writ petitioners could come up with were recommendations made in
2002 by the MCD, for approval of their proposals to convert the land for
residential use purposes and their inclusion in the lay out plan. What has
been relied on by the respondents/writ petitioners are proposals and
recommendations, but never the proposals that were ever notified or amended
subsequently.
LPA No.369/2016 Page 44 of 58
63\. In the opinion of the court, the material on record did not warrant any
findings that MCD was obliged under the changed circumstances - assuming
arguendo that in the subsequent Master Plan, the use could be residential - or
that the SMDC was under a compulsion to accept the proposal to include the
land in the layout plan. Neither law nor equity can be called in aid by anyone
to say that a public obligation vested on account of a statutory duty should
be jettisoned, on account of individual or private interest. In these
circumstances, the claim of the writ petitioners could not trump over that of
the general public and not in the least because they succeeded to the previous
owner‟s interests to the property. The dynamics of town planning are such that
open spaces and common amenities remain precious. Even if the use of the plot
can no longer be that for the original purpose of the school and could
possibly be residential, on application of later developmental or zonal
regulations that per se would not mean that original setting apart of such
land for that public purpose is to cease.
64\. In this context, this Court recollects the previous decision of a
Division Bench, where a co-operative society was allotted lands for plotted
development; as part of the common utilities and other areas, space was set
apart for a school. Some members of the society complained that the change of
the use and incorporation of that area in the later Master Plan as residential
meant that it had to be converted into a residential plot. The court rejected
the plea and imposed costs in Samir Kohli & Ors. v Union of India & Others
(W.P. (C) 4489/1995 decided on 13.04.2012), holding as follows:
> "51. The charge of non-application of mind, in this Court's opinion, is
> devoid of merit and therefore, insubstantial. The reasons cited by the DDA -
> and accepted by the Central Government, to withdraw its earlier direction -

65\. For these reasons, it is held that on the second aspect as well, the writ
petition could not have succeeded in law; the Single Judge clearly erred in
returning findings in favour of the writ petitioners.
66\. The third question is with respect to interpretation of Sections 312 and
313 of the Act. In Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (supra) the question involved was
whether the MCD was correct in permitting sanction of construction "with
condition that the open space for parks and schools be transferred to the
Corporation free of cost." The Supreme Court held, after explaining the LPA
No.369/2016 Page 47 of 58 nature of the MCD‟s obligations and rights as
custodian of lands handed over to it, as follows:
> "None of its provisions entitled the Corporation to claim any right or
> interest in the property of the owner. Sub-section (3) empowers the Standing
> Committee to accord sanction to the lay- out plan on such conditions as it
> may think fit. The expression, 'such conditions' has to be understood so as
> to advance the objective of the provision and the purpose for which it has

> to mean that the Corporation in the exercise of placing restrictions or
> imposing conditions before sanctioning a lay-out plan can also claim that it

67\. It is clear from the above passage that the title and interest in the
land does not vest in the public corporation (in this case, SDMC): however it
has "a right as a custodian of public interest to manage it in the interest of
the society in general. But the right to manage as a local body is not the
same thing as to claim transfer of the property to itself." This enunciation
is supported by the earlier observation that this custodial nature of the
right amounts to "creating an obligation in nature of trust and may preclude
the owner from transferring or selling his interest in it. It may be true as
held by the High Court that the interest which is left in the owner is a
residuary interest which may be nothing more than a right to hold this land in
trust for the specific purpose specified by the coloniser in the sanctioned
lay-out plan."The facts in this case, no doubt are different: it is that the
layout plan continued to be the same, i.e. the area was earmarked for a
school. The MCD in that case had compelled a transfer to itself of the public
spaces; in this case, it refused to amend the layout plan.
68\. In another judgment, In Sri Guru Singh Sabha v. South Delhi Municipal
Corporation, (W.P.(C) 4651 and 5817/2014 decided On: 07.07.2016) this court
held in the context where a layout plan was changed, but was challenged by the
local residents‟ body that:
> "It would thus be noticed, that the question with which these petitions are
> concerned, viz. whether a reservation under Section 313(1)(b) once done for

> public/society..."
69\. As is evident whereas in Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (supra), the MCD granted
permission and sought to help itself to land by a coercive gift, so to say, in
Sai Guru Singh Sabha (supra), the SDMC actually changed the lay out use. The
peculiar facts no doubt lent different dimensions; yet what is important is
that MCD or the SDMC is the custodian of public interest and crucially, the
original owner ceases to have interest. Chet Ram Vashist (supra)says this
clearly:
> "Reserving any site for any street, open space, park, school etc. in a lay-
> out plan is normally a public purpose as it is inherent in such reservation
> that it shall be used by the public in general. The effect of such

> dispute and he holds the land for the benefit of the society or the public
> in general. It may result in creating an obligation in nature of trust and
> may preclude the owner from transferring or selling his interest in it."
70\. Given this position, it is doubtful whether the original owner, i.e. the
colonizer could have conveyed valid title to the plots in question at all by
executing sale deeds in 1994 in favour of the writ petitioners‟ predecessors
in interest.
71\. One of the main arguments of the petitioners accepted by the Single Judge
was that DDA‟s letters dated 14.08.2000 and 17.01.2001,stated that as per
MPD-2001, the land had been shown for residential use. Under the approved
zonal plan of Zone F, the land was a part of proposed Sr. Sec. School. As per
the MPD-2001, the minimum area required for the Sr. School is 4(1.6 ha) acre
and the available land was found inadequate for school. The DDA further
intimated that the subject area was under jurisdiction of MCD and
modification/approval in the layout plan was with LPA No.369/2016 Page 53 of
58 the MCD. It was in fact suggested by the DDA that the area should be used
according to the provisions of the MPD-2001 and the Zonal Plan.
72\. Here, the land no doubt does not belong to SDMC; the minimum area
required for Sr. Secondary School is 4000 sq. mts., which is roughly 4783.96
sq.yds. and the land in question is 1600 sq. yds. The stand of SDMC with
regard to the land being transferred to MCD in 1969 is correct. The layout
plan of the area in question was originally approved in the year 1958 by
Resolution No. 7 dated 03.09.1958 of the SC. Thereafter, the layout plan was
modified in the year 1959. Thereafter, by Resolution No. 183 dated 30.05.1969,
the demarcation plan of the area in question was approved. The land in
question, which is the subject matter of the present petition, was always
shown as earmarked for school. Possession of the land in question was also
handed over to the Municipal Corporation way back in the years 1967 and 1968,
as reflected from the record. These facts, ipso facto, in the opinion of this
Court, did not compel the SDMC to permit residential use. SDMC undoubtedly
cannot - like in Pt. Chet Ram Vashist‟s case compel transfer of the lands unto
itself. However, it has to formally accept the proposal to convert the use.
Here, the petitioners are not on sound footing.
73\. Once the colonizer parted with the properties, and at a time, when the
use of the plot was "fixed" or had crystallized as a public purpose, the
question of its transfer in 1994 could not have arisen. As clearly held in Pt.
Chet Ram (supra), the residual ownership did not extend to the holder of title
the right to transfer the land. Here, not only did the colonizer transfer the
lands at a time, when the use continued to remain unaltered, it appears to
have conferred -through such transactions, rights it never had nor could
claim. Moreover, it is one thing to say that the SDMC can, or may approve a
change of layout; it is another thing entirely to say that it can be LPA
No.369/2016 Page 54 of 58 compelled to do in judicial review. During the
hearing, no rule of law or binding authority was shown to the court, in
support of the submission that a writ or direction of the nature sought could
be given under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
74\. This Court recollects that the Supreme Court had in its judgment in
Friends Colony Development Committee v. State of Orissa and Others (2004) 8
SCC 733 dealt with the obligation of local authorities in the context of zonal
planning and held as follows:
> "22. In all developed and developing countries there is emphasis on planned
> development of cities which is sought to be achieved by zoning, planning and
> regulating building construction activity. Such planning, though highly
> complex, is a matter based on scientific research, study and experience
> leading to rationalisation of laws by way of legislative enactments and
> rules and regulations framed there under. Zoning and planning do result in
> hardship to individual property owners as their freedom to use their
> property in the way they like, is subjected to regulation and control. The
> private owners are to some extent prevented from making the most profitable
> use of their property. But for this reason alone the controlling regulations
> cannot be termed as arbitrary or unreasonable. The private interest stands
> subordinated to the public good. It can be stated in a way that power to

> from the police power of the State. The exercise of such governmental power
> is justified on account of it being reasonably necessary for the public
> health, safety, morals or general welfare and ecological considerations;
> though an unnecessary or unreasonable intermeddling with the private
> ownership of the property may not be justified."
75\. In Howrah Municipal Corpn. And Others v Ganges Rope Co. Ltd. and Others
2004 (1) SCC 663 the question of rights of parties, in the context of town
planning was explained in the following terms:
LPA No.369/2016 Page 55 of 58

76\. The existence of power is one thing; however to say that it has to be
used in one manner, is entirely another. The decision of the LOSC and the
final rejection by the SC took into consideration all circumstances, including
the previous judgments, the opinion of the Chief Legal Adviser, the DDA‟s
position about change of land use and also that no secondary school was
possible. Yet, the final decision of the SDMC was not to include the plots in
the Green Park Extension and construct residences. Besides use for school
purposes, conceivably, SDMC may explore other options for use of the plot for
some other public purpose or purposes, given the acute lack of open spaces in
the city for public amenities and utilities. In these circumstances, the
learned Single Judge was clearly in error in directing the SDMC to reconsider
the matter, in the manner he did, in the impugned judgment.
77\. In view of the foregoing findings, the appeal has to succeed; the
impugned judgment is hereby set aside. The appeal is allowed without any order
on costs.

         S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
1\. The appellant (hereafter "SDMC") is aggrieved by a judgment dated
03.03.2016, allowing a writ petition bearing of the respondents (hereafter
"Garg"). Garg filed the writ petition and sought directions, to set aside the
decision dated 19.05.14 passed by the Lay Out Scrutiny Committee (hereafter
"LOSC") of SDMC; and to direct the SDMC to incorporate their (i.e. the
respondents) plots, (comprised in khasra no. 5, 6, and 14, village Yusuf Sarai
Jat now known as property no. K-28, Green park Extension, New Delhi) in the
layout plan of Green Park Extension colony, New Delhi. The Single Judge set
aside the order dated 19.05.2014 of the LOSC and the decision of the Standing
Committee (hereafter referred to as "SC") dated 17.07.2014, and directed the
SDMC to re-consider the inclusion of plot in Khasra Nos. 5, 6 and 14 ("the
plot" hereafter) at Village Yusuf Sarai Jat (K-
LPA No.369/2016 Page 1 of 58
28 Green Par Extension) in the lay out plan within a period of sixty days from
the date of the impugned judgment.
2\. Garg‟s claim was that the plot in measured 1600 sq. yds. is now known as
property no. K-28, Green park Extension; it was sold by M/s. Urban Development
Company Pvt. Ltd. to five people through registered sale deeds. During the
years 1975 to 1982, the officers of Municipal Corporation of Delhi(MCD) tried

years 1975 to 1982, the officers of Municipal Corporation of Delhi(MCD) tried
to dispossess the erstwhile owners from their plots, a result of which, the
erstwhile owners filed five separate individual civil suits for permanent
injunction against MCD in Civil Court at Delhi. On 01.10.88, Sh.V.K. Malhotra,
Sub Judge, First class, Delhi, decided all the mentioned suits through five
separate judgements, whereby the erstwhile owners were held to be the owners
of their respective plots comprised in the said land.MCD was permanently
restrained from dispossessing them from the said plots. Five separate appeals
were filed against the said judgment before Sh. S.N. Dhingra, ADJ, Delhi, and
these appeals were dismissed by an order dated 21.03.1992.

buyers, Garg being one of them. The MCD again tried to take possession from
