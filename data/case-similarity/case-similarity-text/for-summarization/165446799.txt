to as the ld AO ] passed u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of the Income Tax

issued by the Dispute Resolution Panel [ hereinafter referred to the ‗Ld DRP']
u/s 144C(5) of the Act dated 30.12.2013.
2\. For the same year, the Revenue has also filed an appeal in ITA No. 2518/
Del/2013.
3\. The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal in ITA No.
2538/Del/2014 for the Assessment Year 2009-10:-
―1. Ground No. 1 - Double addition on account of income suo moto offered to
tax in the income 1.1 On the facts and Circumstances of the case, the learned
AO has erred in making addition of Rs. 109,111,565 on account of income
relating to financial year 2008-09 (i.e. financial year relevant to tire
subject assessment Wear) reported as prior period income in the financial
statement for the subsequent financial year (i.e. Financial year 2009-10
relevant to AY 2010-
11) 1.2 On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned AO has erred
in not taking cognizance of the fact that the aforesaid amount was suo moto
offered to tax by the Appellant in the revised return of income filed for the
subject assessment year and hence, such amount cannot be added again.
2\. Ground No. 2 - Double disallowance on account of excess depreciation
claimed suo moto withdrawn in the revised return of income 2.1 On the facts
and circumstances of the case, the learned Assessing Officer has erred in
disallowing excess tax depreciation claim bf Rs 22,89758 on import of capital
goods. 2.2 On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned AO has
erred in not taking cognizance of the fact that the aforesaid claim was suo
moto withdrawn by the Appellant in its revised return of income filed for the
subject assessment year and hence, the aforesaid amount cannot be disallowed
again. Since the aforesaid addition/ disallowance (covered in Ground I and 2
above) have resulted from mistakes apparent from record, a rectification
application has been filed by the Appellant with the learned AO for
rectification of the impugned assessment order and deletion of the above
addition/ disallowance. Ground 1 and 2 shall not be pressed v\here the
rectification application is allowed by the learned AO.

3\. Ground No. 3 - Disallowance of interest incurred on External Commercial
Borrowings ('ECBs') 3.1 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law,
the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in making a disallowance of Rs 454,131
towards interest expenditure incurred in relation to the ECBs availed by the
Appellant for acquisition of fixed assets, by invoking the proviso to section
36( 1 )(iii) of the Act. 3.2 Without prejudice to the above ground, on the
facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned AO has erred in
not allowing depreciation under section 32 of the Act on the disallowed
interest amount, by not adding the same to the actual cost of the acquired
fixed assets.
4\. Ground No. 4 - Disallowance of expenses of capital nature claimed as
revenue expenditure 4.1 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law,
the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred disallowing an amount of Rs 34,745,337
as capital expense debited to the profit and loss account since the invoices
contain reference to Lawful intercept ('LI') project.
4.2 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned AO/
Hon'ble DRP has erred in not taking cognizance of the fact that the above
expenses relate to post implementation professional and training services
provided by Narus Inc.. including demonstration of equipment before regulatory
bodies in relation to equipment supplied.
4.3 Without prejudice to the above grounds, on the facts and circumstances of
the case and in law the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in not allowing
depreciation under section 32 of the Act on the above expenditure.
5\. Ground No. 5- Disallowance of interest incurred on short term loans 5.1 On
the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred
in disallowing interest expense of Rs 7,776,975 incurred on short term loans
availed by the Appellant, by invoking the proviso to section 36(l)(iii) of the
Act. 5.2 Without prejudice to the above ground, on the facts and circumstances
of the case and in law, the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has failed to take
cognizance of the fact that the short term loans were availed by the Appellant
both for the purposes of funding its working capital requirements and
acquisition of fixed assets, which is clearly evident from the cash flow
statement of the Appellant, and hence, disallowance of the entire interest
expenditure is unjustified and untenable in law. 5.3 Without prejudice to the
above grounds, on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the
learned AO has erred

2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 in not allowing
depreciation under section 32 of the Act on the aforesaid interest disallowed
for the subject assessment year.
6\. Ground No. 6-Disallowance of circuit accruals 6.1 On the facts and
circumstances of the case and in law, the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in

financial year relevant to the subject assessment year.
6.2 Without prejudice to the above grounds, on the facts and circumstances of
the case and in law, the learned AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in not holding that

('TDS') 7.1 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law. the learned
AO has erred in considering TDS credit of Rs 104,707,907 as against TDS credit
of Rs 147,292,033 claimed by the Appellant in the return of income filed,
while determining the tax and interest liability for the subject assessment
year. 7.2 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in not allowing credit in respect of additional TDS certificates
(in addition to the TDS credit claimed in return of income) for Rs 5,239,237
filed by the Appellant.
8\. Ground No. 8 - Grounds relating to Transfer Pricing Matters That, on the
facts and circumstances of the case and in law: 8.1 the learned TPO/AO/ DRP
have erred in making an addition of INR 345,115.661 under section 92CA of the
Act to the total income of the Appellant on account of adjustment in arm's
length price ("ALP") of the international transactions pertaining to availing
of intra-group services and payment of royalty (hereinafter referred to as
"impugned transactions") entered into by the Appellant with its associated
enterprises ("AEs"). 8.2 the learned TPO/ AO/ DRP have erred in not accepting
the economic analysis undertaken by the Appellant in accordance with the
provisions of the Act read with the Income- tax Rules, 1962 ("the Rules") in
respect of the impugned transactions and instead, conducting a fresh economic
analysis to hold that the same are not at arm's length. 8.3 the learned TPO/
AO/ DRP have erred in applying the Comparable Uncontrolled Price ("CUP")

2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 8.4 the learned TPO/
AO/ DRP have erred in disregarding the elaborate documentary evidence
submitted as part of assessment proceedings to erroneously assume that 'no
benefit' has been conferred upon the Appellant from the impugned transactions.
8.5 the learned TPO/ AO/ DRP have erred in disregarding the supplementary
analysis furnished by the Appellant in respect of the impugned transactions
during the course of assessment proceedings which further corroborates the
arm's length nature of the said international transactions entered into with
its AEs. 8.6 the learned DRP has erred in not providing the Appellant with an
opportunity of being heard before enhancing the adjustment in respect of
availing of intra-group services and consequently the total income of the
Appellant, thereby vitiating the principles of natural justice.
9\. Ground No. 9- Initiation of penalty proceedings 9.1 On the facts and

10.1 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned AO has

declaring income of Rs. 30.58 crores on 31.03.2011. In the revised return of
income, it offered to tax a sum of Rs. 10.91 crores that had been shown as
prior period income in the financial statements of AY 2010-11. Subsequently,
the return was picked up for the scrutiny and notice u/s 143(2) was issued on
07.01.2011. During the course of assessment proceedings, reference u/s 92CA of
the Act was also made by the ld. AO to the Transfer Pricing Officer to

the final assessment order wherein he computed the total income of the
Appellant at Rs. 80,39,91,690. Pursuant to rectification application filed by
the applicant, the Ld. AO passed an order u/s 154 dated 22.07.2014 .

Officer u/s 143(3) r.w.s 144C of the Income Tax Act has preferred appeal
before us in ITA No. 2538/Del/2014.
11\. Now we first come to the appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 2538/Del/2014.
Ground No. 1 -- Double addition on account of income suo moto offered to tax
in the revised return of income Ground No. 2 -- Double disallowance on account
of excess depreciation claimed suo moto withdrawn in the revised return of

12\. The above two grounds have been disposed off by the rectification order
dated 22.07.2014 passed by the Assessing Officer, hence have not been pressed
by the Ld. AR and therefore they are dismissed as infructuous.
13\. Ground no. 3 of the appeal of Assessee is with respect to the
disallowance of interest expenses incurred on External Commercial Borrowings.
The appellant company had entered into ECB loan facility agreement with its
holding company i.e. AT & T Global Network Holdings LLC to avail ECB's. The
borrowings made were utilized for procurement of capital goods, which were
used by the Appellant in the course of its business. During the F.Y. 2008-09,
the appellant claimed interest expense of Rs. 1,30,69,098 on account of
interest on ECBs availed from its holding company. Of this interest expense,
an amount of Rs. 1,26,14,967 was incurred on ECBs outstanding at the beginning
of the year and the balance interest expense of Rs. 4,54,131 was incurred on
ECBs availed during the year. The ld AO disallowed the interest expense of Rs.
4,54,131 incurred towards ECBs availed during the year by invoking the proviso
to section 36(1)(iii) of the Act. The AO observed that the ECBs have been
utilized for acquisition of capital assets, and thus the interest incurred
till the date such assets have been put to use should be disallowed. The AO
while disallowing the expenditure relied on the case of Breeze Constructions
(P.) Ltd vs ITO, Ward 3(1) [ITA No. 4779 of 2011]. Reasons for disallowance by
the ld AO are as under:-
> ―3.4 The reply of the assessee has been considered and same is found not
> acceptable in view of the following facts:
> A. First argument of the assessee that issue does not fall within the
> proviso to section 36(1)(iii) of the Act is not correct.
The assessee has failed to understand the provisions of section
8|Page AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 36(1)(iii). The case
law of Core Health Care Ltd. relied upon by the assessee pertained to AY
1992-93 i.e. prior to insertion of proviso to section 36(1)(iii). It is
important to stress here that in the judgment relied upon by the assessee. The
ratio of the judgment is as under:
―Sec. 36(1) (iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, has to be read on its own
terms: it is a code of itself It makes no distinction between money borrowed
to acquire a capital asset or a revenue asset. All that the section requires
is that the assessee must borrow capital and the purpose of the borrowing must
be for business, which is carried on by the assessee in the year of account.
Unlike Sec. 37, which expressly excludes an expense of a capital nature, Sec.
36(1) (‗iii) emphasizes the user of the capital and not the user of the asset
which comes into existence as a result of the capital and not the user of the
asset which comes into existence as a result of the borrowed capital. The
Legislature has, therefore, made no distinction in Sec. 36(1) (‗iii) between
―capital borrowed for a revenue purpose‖ and capital borrowed for a capital
purpose ―. An assessee is entitled to claim interest paid on borrowed capital
provided that the capital is used for business purpose irrespective of what
may be the result of using the capital which the assessee has borrowed.
―Actual cost‖ of an asset has no relevancy in relation to Sec. 36(1) (iii).
The proviso inserted in Sec. 36(1) (iii) by the Finance Act, 2003, w.e.f April
1, 2004, will operate prospectively.
Held accordingly, that the assessee was entitled to deduction U/s 36(1) (iii,)
prior to its amendment by the Finance Act, 2003, in relation to money borrowed
for purchase of machinery even though the assessee had not used the machinery
in the year of borrowing.‖ In short, the above amendments have been made by
the Finance Act, 2003, and all the said amendments have been made operational
w.e.f April 1, 2004. Therefore, the proviso inserted in Sec. 36(1) (iii) has
to be read as prospectively and w.e.f April 1, 2004\. As stated above, we are
not concerned with the
9|Page AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 interpretation or
applicability of the applicability of the said proviso to Sec. 36(1) (iii)
w.e. f. April 1, 2004. In the present case‖. (Para 11) From above it is clear
that reliance placed by the assessee on the judgment of Core Health Care Ltd
is not acceptable as it was in respect of AY 1992-93 i.e. prior to amendments
in section 36(1)(iii) and cannot be applied in the instant case. Further the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the order had expressly stated that it was
not concerned with the interpretation or applicability of the proviso to
section 36(1)(iii) and the whole argument of the assessee is based on this,
therefore the facts of this case are distinguishable and not at all relevant
to the case of the assessee.
B. Another argument of the assessee is that Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act,
read with the Proviso to the said section makes it clear that the primary
condition for disallowance of interest expense on funds borrowed for
acquisition of an asset is that such asset should have been acquired for the
purpose of extension of the business. It is further been stated that since
capital goods acquired by the assessee (using the ECB proceeds) have been
acquired for use in the existing business activity of provision of
telecommunication services and not for the purpose of starting another
business activity, acquisition of such capital goods dies not result into
extension of the business of the asset and thus, proviso to section 36(1)(iii)
has no applicability in the instant case.
It is may be pertinent to refer the recent jurisdictional decision of the ITAT
DELHI BENCH ‗A' in the case of Breeze Constructions (P.) Ltd. v. income-tax
Officer, Ward 3(1) in IT Appeal No. 4779 (Delhi) of 2011 [assessment year
2007-08 dated May 4, 2012, wherein the assessee stated that its entire
business has been set up and therefore, contended that proviso of section
36(1)(iii) cannot be applied in the case of the assessee, as there was no
extension of existing business in the assessee's case. The Hon'ble bench held
that:
10 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 ―interest paid, in
respect of capital borrowed for acquisition of an asset for extension of
existing business or profession; for any period beginning from the date on
which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the asset till the date on
which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction. By
implication this proviso is also applicable when assets are acquired for new
business. If the proviso is interpreted to signs' that the same will not be
applicable to such acquisition of assets, it will defeat the whole purpose of
the proviso.‖ The relevant Para 7.3 & 7.4 of the ITAT order are reproduced;
―7.3 Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has further observed that the
interest expenditure is not allowable as per section 36(1) (‗iii) of the Act.
This is due to the proviso to clause 36(1) (iii) which was inserted by the
Finance Act, 2003, with effect from 1.4.2004. Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) observed that the object of the proviso is to disallow interest paid
for acquiring an asset even for extension of the existing business till the
date on which it is brought to use irrespective of the accounting treatment
adopted by the assessee in its book. In this regard, Ld. counsel of the
assessee had contended that proviso to clause 36(1) (iii) cannot be applied to
the assessee‗s ase as there was no extension in the existing business of the
assessee‗s case. Ld. Counsel has pleaded that the entire business has been
setup and there is no extension involved. So he claimed that the proviso is
not applicable in the case of the assessee. We can gainfully refer the
provision of section 36(1) (iii) in this regard. The said section read as
under:-
―(iii) the amount of the interest paid in respect of capital borrowed for the
purposes of the business or profession:
Provided that any amount of the interest paid, in respect of capital borrowed
for acquisition of an asset for extension of existing business or profession
(whether capitalized in the books of account or not,); for any period
beginning from the date on which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of
the asset till 11 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V
DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 the date
on which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction.
Explanation -- Recurring subscriptions paid periodically by shareholders, or
subscribers in Mutual Benefit Societies which fulfill such conditions as may
be prescribed, shall be deemed to be capital borrowed within the meaning of
the clause.‖ 7.4 A reading of the above makes it amply clear that interest
paid, in respect of capital borrowed for acquisition of an asset for extension
of existing business or profession; for any period beginning from the date on
which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the asset till the date on
which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the asset till the date on
which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction. By
implication this proviso is also applicable when assets are acquired for new
business. If the proviso is interpreted to signify that the same will not be
applicable to such acquisition of assets, it will defeat the whole purpose of
the proviso. Thus, we find that Ld. Counsel of the assessee's plea that
proviso is not applicable, is not sustainable. In the background of the
aforesaid discussion and precedent, Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
has passed a reasonable order which does not need any interference on our part
and accordingly, we uphold the same. As regard the assessee's alternative
submission the expenditure involved be allowed to be capitalized, we find that
the same is acceptable. Hence, we that the disallowed expenditure be allowed
to be capitalized.‖ Therefore the facts of this case are squarely applicable
to the facts of the case of the assessee.
C. Another argument of the assessee is that Section 36(l)(iii) of the act read
with the Proviso to the said section makes it clear that the primary condition
for disallowance of interest expense on funds borrowed for acquisition of an
asset is that such asset should have been acquired for the purpose of
extension of the business. It has been discussed earlier that acquisition of
fixed assets during the year amounts to extension of business and in 12 | P a
g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014
(A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 any case as Delhi ITATs decision
the proviso to section 36(1)(iii) is even applicable to a new business.
Therefore in either scenario the interest paid on ECB loan will get disallowed
till the date the asset acquired has been put to actual use.
D. The assessee company has relied upon the case laws for proving that its
case doesn't fall within the meaning of proviso of section 36(1)(iii).
-Gujarat Alchemic and Chemicals Ltd [2008] 295 ITR 85 (SC) 
\- Shah Theaters (P) Ltd. [1988] 169 ITR 499,
\- Kanhiram Ramgopal vs CIT [1988] 170 ITR 41 (MP) It is important to mention
here that the facts of the above mentioned case laws relied upon by the
assessee are different from the facts of the present case and hence can't be
applied to the assessee.
E. The assessee has claimed that extension of existing undertaking was not
present in the instant case is not correct. The details of fixed assets of the
assessee company as on 01.04.2008 & 3 1.03.2009 are tabulated below for your,
reference:
Data tabulated above clearly and earnestly lead to the conclusion that the
company has extended its business and same falls within the purview of proviso
to section 36(1)(iii) of the Income tax Act, 1961. The assessee has claimed
that extension 13 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V
DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 of
existing undertaking was not present in the instant case is not correct.
Hence, in view of the above discussion the plea taken by the assessee is not
acceptable and the proviso to section 36(1)(iii) gets attracted for both set
up of new business as well as for extension of the business (as held in the
judgment of Humble ITAT Delhi Bench in the case of Breeze Constructions (P)
Ltd v. Income-tax Officer, Ward 3(1) in IT Appeal No. 4779 (Delhi) of 2011)
and interest expenditure till the date of put to use shall be added to the
cost of the asset.
3.5 The assessee has failed to furnish any details relating to the date put to
use of the assets acquired by using the ECBs availed during the year. It is
important here to highlight that though the assessee has stated that the ECBs
availed have been used for purchasing capital goods, but it has been unable to
provide the date of put to use of such purchased assets. It is difficult to
understand how a company such as the assessee does not have the details of put
to use of the assets purchased by utilizing the ECBs obtained during the year.
In absence of submission of any details by the assessee, I am constrained to
assume that none of the assets purchased by using the ECBs obtained during the
current assessment year were put to use before April 1, 2009 and hence, the
computation of interest to be allowed has been done on the basis of the
assumption that the purchased capital assets were put to use on April 1, 2009.
3.6 From the details available on record, it is seen that ECBs amounting to
Rs. 102,860,000 were availed on March 2, 2009 and a similar amount (of Rs
102,860,000) was taken on March 19, 2009. Accordingly, in absence of date of
put to use of the capital assets acquired by suing the aforesaid ECBs availed
during the year, date of out to use of such assets has been taken as April 1,
2009 and interest expenditure of Rs 4,54,131/-, relating to ECBs availed
during the year, is being disallowed and added back to the total income of the
assessee company. The above amount is also added to the costs of fixed assets
of the assessee. Penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) are initiated 14 | P a g e

14\. Assessee preferred objection before the DRP who vide direction dated
30.12.2013 vide Para No. 7 has held as under:
> ―7.1 The taxpayer has objected to the proposed disallowance of interest
> expense of Rs. 4,54,131/- incurred on external commercial borrowings (ECB)
> for acquisition of fixed assets by invoking proviso to section 36(1)(iii) of
> the Act.

The acquisition of capital assets for growth of the existing business is not
hit by the proviso to section 36(1) (iii) of the Act. Reliance was placed on
the decision of ITAT in 15 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India)
Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
the case of ITW Signode 110 TTJ 170 wherein it has been held that the term
'extension' connotes that the taxpayer has extended its operations from
present activity to another activity.
7.4 The issue has been considered by the Panel. In the proviso to section
36(1)(iii), the word ―extension‖ has been used which is to be taken as
synonymous to the word ―expansion‖ held in case of Nahar Poly Films Ltd. Vs.
CIT, Ludhiana 201 Taxmann 304 (P&H). The word ‗expansion' is not different
from ‗extension' of business and therefore, the interest expenditure on the
utilization of borrowed funds for the acquisition of new assets, from the date
of its acquisition till the date when the asset is put to use, is to be
disallowed. Moreover, the claim of the taxpayer runs counter to the
legislative intent. The Panel declines to interfere with the proposed
disallowance.
So far as the claim of allowability of depreciation on the amount of
Rs.4,54,131/- is concerned, the AC is directed to verify if the relevant
assets have been put to use during the year or not and proceed accordingly.
However, if the claim is allowed, the AO clearly specify in the assessment
order that the benefits so allowed is subject to the final decision by the
appellate authorities on this matter of disallowance of interest of
Rs.4,54,131/-.
So far the request of the taxpayer for allowing depreciation u/s 32 on the
interest disallowed in AY 2008-09 of Rs. 22,16,117/- is concerned, the AO is
directed to verify if the relevant assets have been put to use or not, either
during FY 2007-08 or FY 2008-09 and proceed accordingly. However, if the claim
is allowed, the AO shall clearly specify in the assessment order that the
benefits so allowed is subject to the final decision by the appellate
authorities on this matter of disallowance of interest of Rs.22,16,117/- made
in AY 2008-09.‖ 16 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V
DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
15\. Before us, the ld DR relied upon the orders of the lower authorities
whereas the AR put forth the following contentions:
> ―1.8 Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act provides that the amount of interest paid
> in respect of capital borrowed for the purpose of business or profession
> shall be allowed as a tax deductible expense. Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act
> reads as under:
> ―36(1) The deductions provided for in the following clauses shall be allowed
> in respect of the matters dealt with therein, in computing the income
> referred to in Section 28 \-
> (i) and (ii)******
> (iii) the amount of the interest paid in respect of capital borrowed for the
> purposes of the business or profession :
> [Provided that any amount of the interest paid, in respect of capital

> period beginning from the date on which the capital was borrowed for

> 1.11 The Hyderabad bench of the Hon'ble Tribunal in the case of ITW Signode

17 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 1.12 Further, the
principle that 'Extension' of a business implies starting of a new business
activity has been affirmed in the following judicial precedent:
 DCIT vs. Gujarat Alkalies & Chemicals Ltd. [2008] 299 ITR 85 (SC), wherein
setting-up of a new plant for producing a new chemical, Phosphoric Acid by an
assessee engaged in Chemical manufacturing has been held as extension of
existing business.
1.13 Thus, the telecom equipment purchased by the appellant using the ECB
loans were for continuation of the existing telecommunication connectivity
business and thus would not constitute extension of business, thereby not
falling under the purview of proviso to section 36(1)(iii) of the Act has no
applicability to appellant‗s case.
1.14 In this regard, reliance is also placed on the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Core Health Care Ltd (298 ITR 194)(SC)
wherein it has been held that Section 36(1)(iii) makes no distinction between
capital borrowed for revenue or capital purposes. Any expenditure incurred in
respect of capital borrowed for the purpose of business shall be allowed
deduction. Similar observation has been made by the Apex Court in the case of
United Phosphorous Limited (299 ITR 9).
1.15 With respect to the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Hon'ble Tribunal
in the case of Breeze Constructions (P.) Ltd, basis which the Ld. AO has made
the aforesaid disallowance, it is submitted that the issue involved was with
respect to allowability of interest expenditure incurred before commencement
of the business itself. In the said case, the taxpayer had incurred interest
expenses for loan obtained for payment of lease in respect of a land taken for
construction of a hotel. However, the other approvals and infrastructure
required for the construction were not in place at the time of claiming such
expenditure, and thus the taxpayer's construction business itself had not
commenced. The aforesaid case does not deal with the issue of extension of
business rather the Hon'ble Tribunal has disallowed the interest expense on
the basic premise that since the business was not set-up/ commenced during the
year, the question of allowability of any expenditure incurred in respect
thereof does not arise at all. Thus, the said decision relied upon by the Ld.
AO is distinguishable on facts and not applicable in the present case.
18 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 1.16 Further, the
Finance Act, 2015 has removed the distinction in allowability of interest in
case of existing business and in case of extension of existing business. It
has deleted the words "for extension of existing business or profession" from
the proviso to Section 36(1)(iii). Thus, it is evident that prior to the
aforesaid amendment, there was admittedly a distinction between ―capital
borrowed for the purposes of the business or profession‖ and ―capital borrowed
for acquisition of an asset for extension of existing business or profession‖.
Had there not been a distinction between the aforesaid terms, the legislature
would not have sought to amend the law to remove such discrepancy. Further,
the appellant's case clearly falls in the category of the former, i.e.
―capital borrowed for the purposes of the business or profession‖ as the
appellant has not started a new activity/ line of business using the ECB
loans. Thus, the disallowance of interest on ECBs made by the Ld. AO is bad in
law and ought to be deleted.
1.17 Accordingly, in the light of the above factual and legal background of
the case, the action of the Ld. AO in making an addition of Rs. 4.54 Lacs in
view of the proviso to Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act is totally erroneous and
warrants to be deleted.
1.18 Without prejudice, where the aforesaid interest amount is disallowed, the
same should be allowed to be capitalized and depreciation under section 32 of
the Act should be allowed thereon.‖
16\. The LD DR relied up on the orders of the ld AO and direction of ld DRP.
17\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and also perused the
facts of the case. Provision of Section 36(1)(iii) is reproduced hereafter:
> iii) the amount of the interest paid in respect of capital borrowed for the
> purposes of the business or profession :
[Provided that any amount of the interest paid, in respect of capital borrowed
for acquisition of an asset for extension of existing business or profession
(whether capitalised in the books of account or not); for any period beginning
from the date on which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the 19 | P

2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 asset till the date
on which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction.]
18\. Undisputedly assessee is engaged in telecommunication business. It has
commenced its business operation on April 07, 2007. The present situation
deals with the case where in the assessee has purchased capital goods for its
existing telecommunication business. The question that arises for
consideration here is that whether the proviso to Section 36(1)(iii) which
disallows the interest paid on acquisition of an asset for extension of
existing business is applicable to the present case or not. In the present
case, whether the assets were acquired for extension of business or not. The
word ―extension‖ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act, 1961 and one has
to resort to the popular meaning of the term. The dictionary meaning of the
word ―extend‖ is a part that is added to something to enlarge or prolong it,
addition, add-on, adjunct, addendum, augmentation, supplement, appendage,
appendix; annexe, supplementary etc. The assessee submitted that the assets
have been acquired only in connection with its existing telecommunication
business. In our view, there is a very thin line of demarcation between the
term expansion and extension, which can be differentiated basis the facts and
evidences brought on record. Neither the Ld AO or the Ld DRP has brought any
evidence on facts to suggest that there was an extension of business during
the year under consideration and the interest paid should be disallowed u/s
36(1)(iii) of the Act. Further, the assessee also distinguished the decisions
relied upon by the lower authorities on facts of the present case. While
arriving at the above finding we also draw support from the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of DCIT vs. Gujarat Alkalies & Chemicals
Ltd. [2008] 299 ITR 85 (SC) cited by the Ld. AR wherein it was held that
‗extension' implies starting of a new business activity. Keeping in view the
above said meaning we are of the view that the telecom equipment purchased by
the Appellant using the ECB loans was for continuation of the existing
business 20 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT
ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 only and not
for the extension of business. Hence, the said proviso to Section 36(1)(iii)
does not apply to the facts of the present case. In the result, the ground No.
3 of the appeal of the assessee is allowed.
19\. Ground no. 4 of the appeal of the Assessee is regarding disallowance of
expenses of Capital nature claimed as revenue expenditure. During the year
under consideration, an invoice of USD 87,724 was issued by Narus Inc.
(Vendor) for 25% value of the Purchase Order per Agreement on account of
Additional Implementation Service for India International Long Distance (ILD)
Lawful Intercept (LI) Project. Similarly, invoices for USD 5,11,480 and USD
92,750 raised by Narus also pertain to LI project. The ld AO observed that
since these services are for International Long Distance Lawful Intercept
Project, they would be capital in nature. Accordingly, the payment made to
Narus Inc. of Rs. 3,47,45,337 was proposed to be disallowed by giving
following reason in the draft assessment order:-
> ―10.1 While perusing the details and corresponding invoices submitted by th
> in invoice no. 1369 dated 5th January 2009 for USD 87,724 raised by Narus
> (the service provider) it has been that 25% of the P0 per Agreement on

10.2 The assessee, vide notice dated 27.02.2013 was asked to furnish its reply
in this regard. In response to the same, the 21 | P a g e AT & T Global

2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 assessee vide its reply dated March 1, 2013, has
merely submitted that these expenses are in respect of post implementation
training services provided by Narus Inc. However, the assessee has not been
able to justify the above claim with any documentary evidence.
10.3 In view of claimed as revenue expense, the above payments (amounting in
to Rs 3,47,45,337) are being disallowed. Penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) are
initiated separately for filing inaccurate particulars of income and thereby
concealing income chargeable to tax.‖
20\. On objection before ld DRP who vide direction dated 30.12.2013 vide Para
No. 11 has held as under:
> ―11.1 This ground relates to the capital expenditure which has been claimed
> as revenue expenditure by the taxpayer. The AO observed that the taxpayer
> claimed revenue expenditure on Lawful Intercept (LI) Project. The invoices
> have been raised by Narus Inc. (the service provider). The last invoice for
> the year bearing no. 1419 dated 26.3.2009 is for 35% of the LI Project. The
> AO did not agree with the submission of the taxpayer that all the expenses

11.3 The claim of the taxpayer has been examined. It is a fact that the
expenses on account of the equipment purchased for the LI Project have been
capitalized by the taxpayer. The impugned expenditure is also for the same
project on demonstration of equipment before the regulatory bodies, training
etc. and the relevant charges have been 22 | P a g e AT & T Global Network
Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 raised by the service provider as a percentage
of the various mile stones for the said project. Under these facts it cannot
be said that the invoices under reference, being certain percentages of the
purchase order, are not related to the expenditure of capital nature. The
action of the AO on this account is therefore, approved.
So far as the alternative claim is concerned, the AO is directed to verify if
the LI Project was completed by 31.03.2009 and if so, it satisfies the
conditions for allowance of depreciation u/s 32 or not and take action
accordingly.‖
21\. The ld AR put forth the following arguments:
> ―2.8 The expense cannot be disallowed merely because the invoice makes
> reference to the ILD/ LI project.
> 2.9 In this regard, it is submitted that Narus Inc. provides the
> intelligence, context, and control services which the network operators need
> to protect the data against cyber threats and to ensure information

> should be allowed to be capitalized and depreciation under section 32 of the
> Act on the same should be allowed to be claimed.‖
22\. The ld DR relied up on the orders of the ld AO as well as the directions
of ld DRP and also agreed that on alternative contention of the 23 | P a g e
AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A)
& ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 allowance of deprecation the claim of
the assessee may be allowed if it is held that the expenses are capital in
nature.
23\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and examined the facts
of the case. In the absence of the evidence to substantiate that the payment
is made for post implementation of project, we agree with the finding arrived
at by the Ld. AO that the payment is for a capital asset. In view of the same,
the ground of appeal is hereby dismissed. However, while giving effect to our
order, the AO is directed to grant depreciation u/s 32 of the Act on the claim
of the assessee after verification. Needless to say that assessee be given an
opportunity of hearing and producing working of the claim of the depreciation
with respect to the actual cost of the assets and amount of depreciation and
rates of depreciation allowance applicable on it. In view of this The ground
no 4 of the appeal of the assessee is allowed on alternative arguments with
above directions.
24\. Ground no. 5 of the appeal of the Assessee is regarding disallowance of
interest incurred on short term loans. During the financial year, the
appellant had taken a working capital loan of Rs. 80,77,12,489 from Citibank,
which was utilized by the appellant for the purpose of its business
activities. Further, interest expense of Rs. 77,76,965 was incurred on such
loans which was claimed as an expense in the return of income for the AY
2009-10. Basis the Cash Flow Statement, the ld AO held that the entire Short
Term Loan of Rs. 807, 71, 24, 891 has been utilized for the purpose of
investment in Fixed Assets of the Company.

25\. Further, the AO has rejected the argument of the assessee that captioned
loan funds were used for both working capital requirements as well as for
purchase fixed assets by holding that the cash flow statement makes it clear
that the entire funding of capital expenditures was done from borrowed funds.
The entire interest expenditure of Rs. 77 Lacs was disallowed by holding that
the assessee has not submitted the details of assets being put to use. The
relevant finding of the ld. AO proposed in the draft assessment order is given
below:

26\. The assessee preferred objection before the Dispute Resolution Panel who
vide direction dated 30.12.2013 vide para No. 12.3 has held as under:
> ―12.3 The issue has been considered by the Panel. In the proviso to section
> 36(1)(iii), the word ―extension‖ has been used which is to be taken as
> synonymous to the word ―expansion‖ as held in case of Nahar Poly Films Ltd.

> appropriate disallowance towards interest deserves to be made.
> So far as the quantum of the short term loans the interest of which is to be
> by the taxpayer as under:
> However, it is noticed that the above computation cannot be said to be
> correct computation for the reasons that:
(i) the taxpayer has not considered the other components of cash flow from
financing activities namely interest paid, 26 | P a g e AT & T Global Network
Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 repayments/proceeds of the short term loans,
repayment of secure loan etc. According to the Annual accounts of the company,
net cash generated from financing activities is Rs. 86.75 crores, which has
been rightly taken by the AO in para 11.1 of the Draft order.
(ii) The taxpayer has also not reduced the closing cash in hand of Rs. 36.66
crores while working out the available cash flow.
In view of the above, the figure of Rs. 84.61 crores as available cash for
investment in fixed assets as claimed by the taxpayer is not acceptable. The
AO has already made a detailed working of available cash flow in para 11.1 of
the Draft order which is found to be in order. Moreover, it is seen that the
total ECB raised during the year of Rs. 20.23 crores and the net short term
loans of Rs. 80.77 crores has been separately shown to work out the net
movement of short term loan at Rs. 86.75 crores. Thus, the taxpayer claimed
that ECB of Rs. 20.23 crores should be part of the available cash flow has
already been allowed by the AO and no further benefit of the same can be given
now.
So far as the claim of allow ability of depreciation on the amount of Rs.
77,76,975/- is concerned, the AO is directed to verify if the respective
assets have been put to use during the year or not and proceed accordingly.
However, if the claim is allowed, the AO shall clearly specify in the
assessment order that the benefits so allowed is subject to the final decision
by the appellate authorities on this matter of disallowance of interest of Rs.
77,76,975/-.‖
27\. The contentions of AR are similar to as raised in support of ground no. 3
above regarding disallowance of interest on External commercial borrowings.
Therefore for the sake of brevity, the contentions have not been reproduced
here.
28\. Before us, the ld. DR relied upon finding of the lower authorities.
29\. Since in Ground No. 3 above, we have already held that there has been no
extension of existing business, the proviso to Section 27 | P a g e AT & T
Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA
NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 36(1)(iii) is not applicable in the facts of
the present case. Hence, the above finding would squarely apply to the present
ground also. In the result the said ground no 5 of the appeal of the assessee
is allowed.
30\. Ground no. 6 of the appeal of the Assessee is regarding disallowance of
circuit accruals. During the year under consideration, Circuit charges
aggregating to Rs. 192.22 crores (Rs. 135.17 crores towards infrastructure
cost and Rs. 57.05 crores towards last mile charges for services provided by
other telecom operators) were incurred. Infrastructure cost represents
bandwidth charges paid to other telecom operators for provision of bandwidth
required for transmission of data. Last mile charges represent charges paid to
other telecom operators towards provision of telecom connectivity services
over the last leg of communication i.e. from the customer's premises to point
of presence of AGNS and vice-versa. As part of the month-end accounting
process, the appellant accrues expenses incurred up till the end of a
particular month based on the liability incurred/crystallized and estimated
expense based on the orders placed for various circuits. Such accruals include
expenses incurred in relation to the services rendered during the relevant
financial year, estimated on a reasonable and scientific basis, for which
bills/invoices are not received during the year. As a practice, accruals for a
particular month are reversed in the succeeding month when fresh accruals for
the period beginning from the start of the year till such month are made.
During the course of assessment, it was noticed from the ledger accounts
submitted by the assessee that a lot of reversal entries were passed in the
aforesaid ledgers. The assessee was asked to produce complete books of
accounts along with substantiating invoices and vouchers in respect of
infrastructure cost and last mile charges. The AO proposed 28 | P a g e AT & T
Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA
NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 disallowance of Rs. 19,91,52,615 by giving
following reason in the draft assessment order:-
> ―7.4 In addition to the above, the assessee also produced ledgers, invoices,
> vouchers in relation to the expenses incurred during the current assessment
> year, which have been perused and verified and do not support the submission
> of the assessee. The reply of the assessee company is devoid of any merits.
> It may be noted that the assessee himself has been able to produce invoices
> for only Rs 15.10 crores out of the total year end accrual of Rs 20.63
> crores and invoices for the balance amount have not been furnished. This
> itself proves that the assessee does not have the invoices for the balance
> amount and there is no basis of recording the year-end accruals. Further, a
> number of invoices submitted by the assessee, forming part of the aforesaid
> amount Rs 15.10 crores, are dated October 2008, November 2008, December
> 2008, January 2009, February 2009 i.e. more than 30 days before the close of
> the current assessment year. As a general practice the invoices in respect
> of expenses incurred are received within a period of 30 days from the date
> of rendering of services in all businesses. In the present case, it is not
> understandable as to why the invoices remained unpaid till the closure of
> the current assessment year. It is important to highlight that the assessee
> has not been able to substantiate that these invoices were actually paid in
> the subsequent year and it appears that these invoices form part of the
> payments made during the current assessment year itself.
> 7.5 In view of the above discussion, it is clear that the assessee has made
> excess provision for circuit charges which is not supported by any
> supporting/ workings and hence, the aforesaid accrual of Rs 20.63 crores is
> being disallowed. Even the invoices amounting to Rs 15.10 crores cannot be
> relied upon in view of the discrepancies highlighted above.
7.6 The assessee has raised a further contention that circuit charges of Rs
187,042,096 disallowed in the draft assessment order of the earlier assessment
year should be allowed as a deduction in the current assessment year. In this
regard, the 29 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT
ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 assessee has
submitted that since the aforesaid circuit accruals, as on March 31, 2008,
were reversed in the current assessment year deduction for the same should be
allowed. In this regard, since the claim for the aforesaid expenditure was not
allowed in the previous year since these provisions were not supported by any
workings/ Invoices/ vouchers, the same should not be allowed as a deduction in
the current assessment year also.
7.7 In addition to the above, vide letter dated February 18, 2013, it was
submitted by the assessee that circuit charges of Rs 7,205,063 proposed for
disallowance in the earlier assessment year, based on the observation of the
special auditor that such expenses relate to the current assessment year,
should be allowed as a deduction in the current assessment year. The
submission of the assessee has been considered. Since the aforesaid expenses
were disallowed in the preceding assessment year on account of the fact that
such expenses relate to the current assessment year, deduction in respect of
the above expense of Rs 7,205,063 is allowed.
7.8 In view of the above discussion and the facts of the case, disallowance of
Rs 19,91,52,615 is made for the current assessment year. Penalty proceedings
u/s 271(1)(c) are initiated separately for filing inaccurate particulars of
income and thereby concealing income chargeable to tax.‖
31\. The assessee preferred objection before the Dispute Resolution Panel and
further submits invoices aggregating to Rs. 1.97 crores by way of additional
evidence. The Ld. Dispute Resolution Panel vide direction dated 30.12.2013
vide para No. 9.3 has held as under:
> ―9.3.1 The Panel has perused the draft order and the submissions made by the
> taxpayer. The disallowance proposed by the AO is for Rs. 20.63 crores. Out
> of it, the AO has himself mentioned in the draft assessment order that the
> taxpayer produced invoices for Rs.15.10 crores.
Before the Panel, the taxpayer has submitted some more 30 | P a g e AT & T
Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA
NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 invoices aggregating to Rs.1.97 crores by way
of additional evidence for the period relating to FY 2008-09. The taxpayer has
also made out its case for the relief of the corresponding amount of Rs.3.08
crores, which has been disallowed by the AO in AY 2008-09 as it tantamount to
the double addition.
9.3.2 Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the Panel directs
as under:
(i) To the taxpayer: The taxpayer is directed to submit copy of such invoices
to the AO with in the 7 days of receipt of this order, so that AO may get
adequate time to make verification, and assist the AO in the process of
verification.
(ii) To the AO: The AO is directed to:
(a) Make verification of the additional invoices aggregating to Rs.1.97 crores
and in case he is satisfied with the veracity of their crystallization during
FY 2008-09, to exclude the corresponding amount being the expenses accrued
during FY 2008-09 for bandwidth usage availed of by the taxpayer,
(b) exclude the sum of Rs.15.10 crores, which stands verified by him during
the course of assessment proceedings, being the expenses accrued during FY
2008- 09 for bandwidth usage availed of by the taxpayer,
(c) allow the deduction for Rs.3.08 crores, being the amount disallowed in AY
2008-09 by the AO himself, for the reason that the said amount is part and
partial of the total circuit accrual (provision) made during FY 2007-08 of
Rs.154.88 crores and which has been reversed on 1.4.2008. However, the AO
shall clearly record in the draft order that the said relief is subject to the
fact that in case the taxpayer gets relief by any Higher judicial authority on
this account in AY 2008-09 (where the said amount has been disallowed as of
now), the relief allowed in AY 2009- 10 gets automatically withdrawn.‖
32\. As per directions of DRP, the assessee company was provided opportunities
vide notice u/s 142(1) of the I.T Act, 1961 dated 10.02.2014 to bring
documentary evidence in support of its claim and to verify the genuineness of
the claim. The ld AR of the assessee company submitted its reply vide letter
dated 14.02.2014 and details 31 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services
(India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y
2009-10 of additional invoices along with copy of invoices were produced and
verified. On verification it was found that copies of invoices of
Rs.1,94,36,715/- were produced by the AR of the assessee company which were
found correct. Therefore, credit of additional invoices of Rs.1,94,36,715/-
was allowed to the assessee company. Hence, in view of the additional
evidences submitted the assessee was granted partial relief.
33\. Before us, the ld DR relied upon the findings of the lower authorities
whereas the AR put forth the following contentions:
4.3 Infrastructure cost represents bandwidth charges paid to other telecom
operators for provision of bandwidth required for transmission of data. Last
mile charges represent charges paid to other telecom operators towards
provision of telecom connectivity services over the last leg of communication
i.e. from the customer's premises to point of presence of AGNS and vice-versa.
For instance, a Multinational Corporation having its offices at different
locations across India contracts with the appellant for providing connectivity
between its offices at various locations. Each segment between offices at two
different locations constitutes a circuit and has a unique circuit ID. The
appellant is engaged to provide connectivity for all such circuits of the
company/customers.
4.4 As part of the month-end accounting process, the appellant accrues
expenses incurred up till the end of a particular month based on the liability
incurred/crystallized and estimated expense based on the orders placed for
various circuits. Such accruals thus include expenses incurred in relation to
the services rendered during the relevant financial year, estimated on a
reasonable and scientific basis, for which bills/invoices are not received
during the year.
4.5 As a practice, accruals for a particular month are reversed in the
succeeding month when fresh accruals for the period beginning from the start
of the year till such month are made. All the payments made against the
aforesaid accruals are accounted for in an account namely prepaid circuit
ledgers and later on reduced from the circuits accrual account at the end of
the month.
4.6 Before embarking on the merits of the case, it is important to highlight
the accounting procedure followed by the company in 32 | P a g e AT & T Global
Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 connection with the circuit accruals. In light
of the above the facts are submitted as under:
Circuit Charges - Background Circuit Charges are incurred towards
infrastructure cost and last mile charges for services provided by other
telecom operators. Broadly Circuit Charges are classified into following two
categories: a. Infrastructure cost: This represents bandwidth charges paid to
local Indian telecom operators for provision of bandwidth required for
transmission of data.
b. Last mile charges: This represent charges paid to other telecom operators
towards provision of telecom connectivity services over the last leg of
communication i.e. from the customer's premises to point of presence of AT&T
Global Network Services India Private Limited (appellant) and vice-versa.
System for recording Circuit accruals  Circuit charges are recorded through a
system called GAIM (Global Access Inventory Management System) on a worldwide
basis.
 GAIM is a highly automated system and is used by appellant as an operational
tool to manage inter-alia circuit inventory and perform vendor invoice
validation relating to such circuits.
a) Process flow for booking the Circuit charges in GAIM The process undertaken
for booking the Circuit charges across the world is explained briefly as
below:
 As and when a requests for new circuits is placed by the customer to
appellant, a request is created through another system called NGGNI(Next
Generation Global Network International) in favour of third party vendor who
in turn is required to provide service.
 Such requests are converted into orders by the Customer Access Provisioning
Team who act as primary interface with the vendors with regard to ordering and
delivery of the circuits;
 Order is placed with the vendor to deliver circuit at a particular address
and at a particular time;
 Accordingly, vendor delivers the circuit (along with necessary hardware and
software);
33 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10  Post such delivery,
the order gets close and the inventory of circuit usage is recorded in GAIM.
GAIM contains various details relating to the circuit, such as Circuit ID
number, activation date, tariff codes (rental, usage, one time charge),
expected monthly cost, location of circuit, etc.;
 Once the order is closed, the liability to pay the vendor arises;
 Invoice received by the vendor are entered into GAIM manually or uploaded
from electronic files;
 Thereafter, invoices are validated in GAIM before payment. During invoice
validation, GAIM automatically compares the invoice/bill data to the circuit
inventory and expected costs;
 The validation process also identifies any discrepancies which have to be
resolved via the dispute management process before the invoice can be approved
for payment.
 The validation checks include:
\- Circuit ID exists in inventory for vendor;
\- Invoice date is after circuit activation date;
\- Service period is before circuit cease date;
\- Invoice tariff code matches order tariff code
\- Invoice cost is not varying more than USD 100 vis-à-vis the expected cost
\- Invoice number is unique for vendor  The invoices for which validation is
completed with no discrepancies or for which the discrepancies identified, the
same are logged / resolved via dispute management process, are approved for
payment.
 At the month end, two files are generated i.e. General Ledger Expense Feed
and General Ledger Accruals Feed.
 For creating the General Ledger Expense Feed file GAIM selects all invoice
costs for the current or prior period where the invoice payment status is
accepted.
 General Ledger Accruals Feed file contains only current year expense and is
a year to date (YTD) file. As GAIM works on calendar year basis i.e. from
January to December, thus the accruals for the period starting from January to
March are excluded / added on proportionate basis.
b) Logic used by GAIM to calculate the Circuit Accruals 34 | P a g e AT & T
Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA
NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 The logic used by GAIM to calculate the
accrual includes the following key steps:
>  Circuit Accruals are calculated for both active and ceased circuits taking
> into account the activation date and the cease date i.e. no accruals will be
> posted prior to the activation date or after the cease date.
>  For the current and prior period GAIM will look at each tariff code for
> each circuit to determine if there is any invoice cost and circuit accruals
> are booked accordingly.
Prior year expenses are tracked each month and matched against the prior year
accrual balance brought forward manually. Accordingly, only the current year
accrual balances are booked in the profit and loss account.
4.7 The break up of actual expense and year end accruals are given below:
> Total Expense - Rs. 192.22 Crores Actual Payment = Rs. Accruals Booked
> 172.30 Crores = Rs. 19.92 Crores 4.8Accruals A computa for which Additional
> evidence Accruals for which no bills / bills / evidences for filed before
> DRP and evidences for reversals reversals submitted relief granted = could
> be submitted = Rs.
to AO = Rs. 15.10 Rs. 1.94 Crore 2.87 Crores (14% of total Crores Accruals)
4.9 Detail of the circuit accruals disallowed in the final assessment order is
as under:
Disallowance in the Draft Order Rs. 19.91 crores 35 | P a g e AT & T Global
Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 Less: Relief allowed by DRP after verification
of invoices Rs. 17.04 crores Disallowance for the AY 2009-10 Rs. 2.87 crores
Less: credit allowed for AY 2009-10 Rs. 3.08 crores Credit allowable during
the AY 2009-10 Rs. 20.84 Lacs 4.10 Basis the detailed process of recording
circuit accruals, it may be appreciated that the circuit accruals are
accounted on the basis of established scientific mechanism. The appellant
follows this method of accruing circuit charges each year and the practice is
in line with the business activity of the appellant industry. Thus, similar to
warranty provisions, which are estimated on scientific methodology and based
on consistent trend and are allowable expenses, the circuit accruals are an
integral part of the appellant's business functions and should be allowed,
since it is a year on year unavoidable feature. In this regard attention is
placed on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Rotork
Controls India (P) Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income-tax (314 ITR 62) wherein
the Apex Court after analyzing the provisions of the Act and accounting
principles in detail laid the controversy to rest by holding that warranty
expenses provided by the assessee on scientific basis in compliance with the
accrual basis of accounting are allowable as deduction in the relevant
financial year and no disallowance in this regard can be made by the revenue
authorities.
4.11 Since the year-end circuit accruals created by appellant represent
accruals towards normal business expenditure incurred by appellant for the
relevant financial year and recorded in accordance with the matching
principle, deduction in respect thereof should be allowed to the appellant.
4.12 Appellant has been able to produce documentary evidence subsequent
utilization/reversal of more than 85% of the expenses represented by year -
end circuit accruals, which itself evidences that even the balance accruals
have also been created on a reasonable basis and hence, no disallowance in
this regard can be made against appellant.
4.13 Accordingly, the allegation of the Ld. AO that no documentary evidence
has been produced by the appellant in respect of the circuit accruals is
erroneous and the addition warrants to be deleted 36 | P a g e AT & T Global
Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
34\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the order
of the ld TPO/ AO/ DRP . The assessee has explained the basis of creating the
provisions for circuit accruals, which is calculated automatically and
scientifically by the software. As submitted assessee has been followed this
basis on a global basis. As explained by the appellant, the process is
scientific in a way that as and when a request for new circuits is placed by
the customer to appellant, the request is created in favour of third party
vendor who in turn is required to provide service. Such requests are converted
into orders by the Customer Access Provisioning Team who act as primary
interface with the vendors with regard to ordering and delivery of the
circuits. Order is placed with the vendor to deliver circuit at a particular
address and at a particular time. Accordingly, vendor delivers the circuit
(along with necessary hardware and software). Post such delivery, the order
gets close and the inventory of circuit usage is recorded in GAIM( Global
Access Inventory management system) . GAIM contains various details relating
to the circuit, such as Circuit ID number, activation date, tariff codes
(rental, usage, one time charge), expected monthly cost, location of circuit,
etc. Once the order is closed, the liability to pay the vendor arises. Invoice
received by the vendor are entered into GAIM manually or uploaded from
electronic files. Thereafter, invoices are validated in GAIM before payment.
During invoice validation, GAIM automatically compares the invoice/bill data
to the circuit inventory and expected costs. As GAIM works on calendar year
basis i.e. from January to December, the accruals for the period starting from
January to March are excluded / added on proportionate basis. Assessee further
explained that the validation process also identifies any discrepancies which
have to be resolved via the dispute management process before the invoice can
be approved for payment. The validation checks include:
 Circuit ID exists in inventory for vendor;  Invoice date is after circuit
activation date;
37 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10  Service period is
before circuit cease date;  Invoice tariff code matches order tariff code 
Invoice cost is not varying more than USD 100 vis-à-vis the expected cost 
Invoice number is unique for vendor The invoices for which validation is
completed with no discrepancies or for which the discrepancies identified, the
same are logged / resolved via dispute management process, are approved for
payment. The assessee also explained the logic used by GAIM to calculate the
Circuit Accrual for both active and ceased circuits taking into account the
activation date and the cease date i.e. no accruals will be posted prior to
the activation date or after the cease date. For the current and prior period
GAIM will look at each tariff code for each circuit to determine if there is
any invoice cost and circuit accruals are booked accordingly. Prior year
expenses are tracked each month and matched against the prior year accrual
balance brought forward manually. Accordingly, only the current year accrual
balances are booked in the profit and loss account.
35\. We find that the process explained is entirely automated process which
captures the details vis-à-vis each circuit, amount to be booked against each
circuit and the accrual to be created. Further, assessee has been creating the
provision on an year on year basis in accordance with the mercantile system of
accounting in accordance with accounting standard issued by the ICAI otherwise
correct expenditure would not be captured as per the matching principle. The
assessee has also demonstrated through evidences that the provision so created
is either reversed or expensed off in the subsequent year. The assessee has
also been able to submit evidences for most of the reversals before the lower
authorities. It is also not the claim of the revenue that the amount of
provisioning made by the assessee is incorrect or not based on proper
documentation and estimations. We also find that the lower authorities allow
the entire claim of 38 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt
Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
expenditure in the next year when such reversals are made. Thus, we are of the
view that this practice of disallowing the claim of circuit accrual in the
year of creation and allowing it in the next year is nothing but a timing
difference. The fact that the expenses are allowed in the subsequent year also
proves that the lower authorities have not disputed the incurrence of such
expenses. Hence, in accordance with the mercantile provisions it should be
allowed in the year of creation itself. The assessee has also drawn reference
to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s
Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd (314 ITR 62) and M/s Bharat Earth Movers (245
ITR
428). According to us the provision for circuit accruals is made in compliance
of accounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India and also on a proper scientific basis backed by documentation. Therefore
, we hold that the circuit accruals are created on scientific basis and thus
needs to be allowed in the year of creation on accrual basis. In the result
the ground No. 6 of the appeal is allowed.
36\. Ground no. 7 of the appeal of the Assessee is regarding disallowance of
credit of additional TDS certificates. We have heard the parties on this

transactions is computed having regard to the same base;
(iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (ii) arising in
comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the
differences, if any, between the international transaction or the specified
domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between
the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect
the amount of net profit margin in the open market;
(iv) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise and referred to in sub-
clause (i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to
in sub-clause (iii);
(v) the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to
arrive at an arm's length price in relation to the international transaction
or the specified domestic transaction‖ ―Most appropriate method.
10C. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the most
appropriate method shall be the method which is best suited to the facts and
circumstances of each particular international transaction or specified
domestic transaction, and which provides the most reliable 57 | P a g e AT & T
Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA
NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 measure of an arm's length price in relation
to the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction, as the
case may be.
(2) In selecting the most appropriate method as specified in sub-
rule (1), the following factors shall be taken into account, namely:--
(a)............
(b)............
(c) the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for
application of the method;
(d).............
(e)............‖
(f)...........
2.3 On perusal of the above provisions of the Act and Rules, Your Honour's may
kindly observe that the fundamental requirement for application of application
of CUP method (as adopted by the TPO) is finding the ―price‖ of a comparable
uncontrolledtransaction for benchmarking the transaction. In absence of
availability of any comparable data for benchmarking purpose, the application
of this method fails. The Appellant most humbly submits that since the Ld.
TPO/Hon'ble DRP has not brought any data on record for benchmarking the
transaction, treating the value of services as NIL by application of CUP
method is against the TP regulations.
2.4 The Appellant submits that in such a scenario when no data is available to
apply the direct methods, one has to resort to residuary methods for
benchmarking a transaction / group of transaction such as ‗TNMM'. Considering
all these factors the Appellant adopted TNMM to benchmark the transaction, but
on an aggregated basis (specific submission on application of aggregated
approach is stated in paras below). Thus the Appellant submits that TNMM in
the facts of the Appellant's case should be treated as a ‗most appropriate
method' for determining ALP of support services received from the AE.
Aggregated approach 58 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt
Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 2.5
The Appellant submits that the support services is a transaction closely
linked with provision of network connectivity services. It cannot be
segregated from these activities of an enterprise, being embedded therein.
Thus, support services cannot be considered / benchmarked in isolation on a
standalone basis. Overall TNMM is thus a correct method for benchmarking the
transaction of support services received from the AE.
2.6 At this juncture, it may be pertinent to quote the relevant Rule dealing
with the under consideration -
Relevant provisions of the Rules 10A. For the purposes of this rule and rules
10AB to 10E,--
(d) "transaction" includes a number of closely linked transactions.
2.7 It can be seen from the above definition that the ‗transaction' includes
closely linked transactions. The Appellant submits that aforesaid support
services are integral to the core operations of rendering network connectivity
services since in the absence of the support services, the Appellant's entire
business operations would be interrupted and would come to a standstill.
Therefore, the aforementioned services are indispensable for ensuring
continuity in business operations. Hence, it can be reasonably construed that
the support services are closely linked to the primary transaction of network
connectivity services.
2.8 The Appellant relies on the decision of Hon'ble ITAT in case of Demag
Cranes & Components (ITA No. 1683/PN/2011) where it has upheld the aggregation
of closely linked transactions. (Refer Para 31 on Page no. 110 of the Case Law
Compendium) (Para 31, Page 22of the order) 2.9 The Appellant also relies on
the jurisdictional High Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications India Pvt. Ltd. and others [ITA No. 16/2014] whereby it held
that the aggregation of transactions is desirable in the case 59 | P a g e AT
& T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) &
ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 where the transactions are inter-linked.
(Refer Para 137 on Page no. 512 of the Case Law Compendium) 2.10 Lastly the
Appellant would like to draw attention to OECD Guidelines 1.42 which states
that:
"Ideally, in order to arrive at the most precise approximation of fair market
value, the arm's length principle should be applied on a transaction-by-
transaction basis. However, there are often situations where separate
transactions are so closely linked or continuous that they cannot be evaluated
adequately on a separate basis. Such transactions should be evaluated together
using the most appropriate arm's length method or methods."
2.11 Accordingly, based on the above facts and legal positions, it is
submitted that the payment for support services are inter-connected with the
provision of network connectivity services undertaken by the Company and thus
the Appellant prays before Your Honours to kindly consider the economic
analysis conducted for the network connectivity services along with support
services by the company and accept the aggregated approach adopted for
benchmarking the transaction.
Rebuttal of each arguments made by the TPO for application of CUP Need for
services:
2.12 At the outset, the Appellant submits that the support requested by the
Appellant from its AE was aimed at achieving the following objectives:
 Maintenance and fixing repairs or outages for customers of the Appellant;
 Processing customer orders and handling service provisioning;
 Pre-sales support, building customized solutions for customers and provide
services like technical design, inputs on commercial (pricing) & legal and
contractual 60 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT
ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 aspects of the
bid, specification design, identification of customer requirements etc.;
 Contract management, service delivery, order updates, on-
going communication with customers and life cycle management of AGN nodes;
 IT support function including helpdesk, internal network monitoring support
and IT system and maintenance;  Review of pricing terms of contracts, process
invoices reversals and adjustments, resolve customer disputes etc.; and 
General project management, monitoring of all implementation issues addressing
issues being faced by customers 2.13 Without prejudice to the above, the
Appellant would like to most humbly submit that nowhere the Transfer Pricing
provisions require the Appellant to demonstrate the need of availing such
services. The Transfer Pricing provisions only requires ascertaining whether
the price paid for such services is at arm's length or not.
2.14 The aforesaid argument is supported by the principles laid down by the
Hon'ble Mumbai ITAT in the case of DresserRand India Private Limited vs. ACIT
ITA No. 8753 / Mum / 2010. (Refer Para 8 on Page no. 131 of the Case Law
Compendium) 2.15 Thus, the Appellant submits that the objections raised by the
TPO/DRP that there is no need for services is unjustified and not tenable in
law.
Commercial Expediency 2.16 The Appellant further submits that the nature of
services to be availed is entirely prerogative of the tax payer and his
commercial wisdom which cannot be questioned even by a tax authority and it is
not always necessary to co-relate the benefits received and the amount paid
for the services.
2.17 The aforesaid argument is supported by the observations made by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax vs.
Dhanrajgirji Raja 61 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd
V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
Narasingirji (91 ITR 544)(Refer Page no. 114 of the Case Law Compendium) 2.18
Further, the reliance can be placed upon the recently pronounced decision of
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs Cushman and Wakefield
(India) Pvt Ltd. (ITA 475/ 2012), wherein, it was held that the authority of
the TPO is to conduct a TP analysis to determine the ALP and not to determine
whether the tax payer derives a benefit from the service. The Hon'ble Delhi
High Court has opined that the determination of benefit to the tax payer is
not in the domain of the TPO. (Refer Para 34 on Page no. 89 and 90 of the Case
Law Compendium) In this regard, the Appellant also relies on the following
judicial precedents:
\- Ericsson India Private Limited vs Dy CIT [ITA No. 5141/Del/2011 (Delhi
ITAT)] (Refer Para 29 on Page no. 175 to 178 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- CIT v. EKL Appliances Ltd. [2012] 345 ITR 241 (Delhi) (Refer Para 10 on
Page no. 141 to 143 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- Hive Communication Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.306/2011) (Refer Para 7 on Page no.
205 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Cushman and Wakefield (India) P. Ltd. (269
CTR 16) (Del.)
\- (Refer Para 36 on Page no. 90 and 91 of the Case Law Compendium) 2.19 The
Appellant submits that it is settled legal position in law that the revenue
authorities cannot challenge the commercial expediency / wisdom of the
Appellant. Thus the challenge of the TPO/DRP questioning the wisdom of the
Appellant is unjustified and not tenable in law.
ALP of an international transaction cannot be NIL 2.20 The Appellant submits
that it has demonstrated the fact that the services were rendered by the AE
and the same 62 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V
DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 was for
the purpose of business hence, the DRP was unjustified in treating the value
of the services at NIL.
2.21 The mandate of the TPO/DRP under the Act and as per the relevant Rules is
just to determine the value of international transaction by benchmarking it as
per the methods provided u/s 92C(2) of the Act. The wholesale disallowance of
any payment without applying any method or using any comparable uncontrolled
transaction for benchmarking the transaction is giving arbitrary powers to the
TPO/DRP. Even Rule 10B(1)(a) does not authorize disallowance of expenditure on
the ground that it was not necessary or prudent for the assessee to have
incurred for the same.
2.22 The Appellant relies on the following judgements whereby it has been
categorically held that value of international transaction cannot be treated
as ‗Nil' -
\- McCann Erickson India P. Ltd. Vs. Addl. (ITA No. 5871/De1/2o11) (Del.)
(Refer Para 9 on Page no. 324 and 325 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- AWB India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT (ITA No. 648o/De1/2o12) (Del.) (Refer Para 15
to 18 on Page no. 37 to 38 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- DCIT vs. M/s. Diebold Software Services Pvt. Ltd (ITA No. 4347/Del/2o12)
(Del.) (Refer Para 5 on Page no. 120 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- Platinum Guild India Private Limited vs. DCIT (ITA No. 7720/Mum/2012)
(Mum.) (Refer Para 10 on Page no. 391 of the Case Law Compendium)
\- Merck Ltd. Vs. DCIT (148 ITD 513) (Mum.) (Refer Para 24.5 to 24.7 on Page
no. 353 and 354 of the Case Law Compendium) 2.23 Based on the legal principles
enunciated above it is concluded that the TP adjustment can be made by the
TPO/DRP only by applying any specific method as stated u/s 92C(2) of the Act.
In facts of the present case even though the TPO/DRP mentions that CUP should
be used 63 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA
No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 for benchmarking
the transaction, the method is not applied in its true sense, since no
comparable uncontrolled transaction is used for benchmarking the transaction.
According to Hon'ble DRP since no benefit is received the value of transaction
is treated as NIL, which is unjustified and not tenable under the TP
Regulations.
Benefit Test 2.24 The Appellant submits that one of the contention of the
Hon'ble DRP to treat the value of services as NIL is that no benefit is
received by the Appellant. The Appellant most humbly submits that the ‗benefit
test' cannot be applied to determine the ALP of transaction. The domain of the
TPO/DRP is only to examine as to whether the payment based on the agreement
adheres to the arm's length principle or not.
2.25 The contention of the TPO/DRP that the Appellant has failed to show any
benefit received is totally irrelevant for the reason that whether the
expenses incurred for the services, benefits the assessee in monetary terms or
not has no role to play in determining the ALP of the services.
2.26 In this regard, the Appellant relies on the decision of Bangalore
Tribunal in the case of Safran Aerospace India P. Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA No.
1261/Bang/2010) (Refer Para 8.3 on Page no. 399 of the Case Law Compendium)
2.27 In view of the principle laid down by the above judgment it can be
concluded that ‗benefit test' cannot be a criteria for benchmarking the ALP of
any international transaction. Hence, the contention of the TPO/Hon'ble DRP
that no benefit is received and hence the value is treated is NIL, is totally
unjustified in the eyes of the law.
Conclusion 2.28 In the present case, the Appellant caters to US multinational
enterprises and it is obvious that in order to ensure business continuity, the
Appellant would need back bone support services such as troubleshooting,
network engineering, service deliver etc. This helps in rendering seamless
services to the customers and ensures 64 | P a g e AT & T Global Network
Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 data privacy which builds trust and lasting
relationships with the customers. Further, due to level of confidentiality
which needs to be maintained for protecting the sensitive data relating to
customer's bank account, medical status, etc., it would be preposterous to
even think that the Appellant would avail such services through a local
service provider in India and put the entire business at risk.
2.29 The Appellant submits that the entire business is dependent upon availing
such support services from the AEs, which is marked up again while billing to
the AE in the form of network support services. The Appellant has submitted
all the relevant documents to prove that the services were rendered & hence,
the action of the Hon'ble DRP of treating the arms-length value of the payment
made for availing such services at NIL, is arbitrary, unsubstantiated and
ought to be struck down.
2.30 Further, since no benchmarking methodology has been adopted by the
TPO/Hon'ble DRP, the benchmarking adopted by the Appellant in its TP study
i.e. TNMM on an aggregated basis, should be adopted and the adjustment made on
the values of support services should be deleted.
40\. The main thrust of assessee's submission is that in respect of each intra
group services the assessee has been able to justify the basis of allocation
of cost, need for service and the benefit it derived out of these services. In
support of its arguments, the assessee also filed the back-up documentation
before the lower authorities for verification.
41\. The Ld. DR on the other hand has supported the order of DRP and AO and
submitted that
1) That there was no need for such services in first place
2) Even if there was need, the assessee has not been able to demonstrate that
the services have been rendered.
3) The assessee has not been able to meet the benefit test.
4) Assessee has not been able to substantiate its case by way of proper
documentation
5) Similar disallowance has already been held in AY 2008-09
42\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. Before us, the Ld.
AR has submitted compilation of paper books and synopsis where in 65 | P a g e
AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A)
& ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 the submissions made before the TPO and
DRP were submitted. He further relied on several judicial precedents on the
issues. Ld. AR also submitted several judicial precedents, which are also
noted in his submissions. We have considered them in detail.
43\. The brief facts are that the Appellant caters to US multinational
enterprises and to render services to its customers, it says that it needs
support services such as troubleshooting, network engineering, service
delivery etc. This helps in rendering seamless services to the customers and
ensures data privacy. For availing these services, the Appellant has entered
into a Services Agreement dated 19th March, 2008 with AT&T Communication
Services International Inc. (‗ACSI Inc.'). As per the said agreement, ACSInc.
shall render the aforesaid services to the Appellant on cost plus markup.
Assessee paid a sum of Rs. 25.16 crores for availing these services whose ALP
has been determined at NIL by the TPO/DRP by holding that the assessee did not
obtain any benefit out of such services and the services provided by the
foreign AE were not required. Further, TPO also held that since the assessee
failed to provide sufficient evidence about the services rendered by the AE,
the ALP of this international transaction was determined at Nil.
44\. Provisions of the Income tax Act for the computation of Arm's length
price of any international transaction provides as under :
> Computation of income from international transaction having regard to arm's
> length price.
> 92\. (1) Any income arising from an international transaction shall be
> computed having regard to the arm's length price.
Explanation.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the
allowance for any expense or interest arising from an international
transaction shall also be determined having regard to the arm's length price.
(2) Where in an international transaction [or 66 | P a g e AT & T Global
Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 specified domestic transaction], two or more
associated enterprises enter into a mutual agreement or arrangement for the
allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or expense
incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility
provided or to be provided to any one or more of such enterprises, the cost or
expense allocated or apportioned to, or, as the case may be, contributed by,
any such enterprise shall be determined having regard to the arm's length
price of such benefit, service or facility, as the case may be.
45\. According to the above provisions following principles emerge:-
> i. An international Transaction is entered in to between two or more
> associated enterprises for jointly acquiring or developing some property or
> for obtaining services. ii. The parties to transaction enter in to mutual
> agreement or arrangement to share cost or expenses incurred or to be

services and the basis of allocation of the cost charged by the AE for these
intragroup services. Regarding the need test the assessee explained that the
support requested by the assessee from the AE was aimed at achieving the
following objectives:
>  Maintenance and fixing repairs or outages for customers of the Appellant;
>  Processing customer orders and handling service provisioning;  Pre-sales
> support, building customized solutions for customers and provide services
> like technical design, inputs on commercial (pricing) & legal and
> contractual aspects of the bid, specification design, identification of
> customer requirements etc.;  Contract management, service delivery, order
> updates, on-going communication with customers and life cycle management of

>  IT support function including helpdesk, internal network monitoring
> support and IT system and maintenance;

48\. The assessee also contended that in telecom business credibility,
reliability and speed of data, network and system is what defines the usage of
network. So the assessee contended that it would rely on the best of resources
and system which in the instant case is available at APAC level with their
related party. The assessee would not have been able to sustain if a third
party, which may through services can't control and ensure the above
parameters.
49\. On appreciation of the above facts it is apparent that looking at the
nature of the business of the assessee and the kind of industry the assessee
operates in, the assessee has justified that such services are required. It is
not the case of the ld TPO that assessee is having this services therefore
they are duplicative in nature or are in nature of shareholders' services. It
is pertinent to note that requirement of the services should be judged from
the viewpoint of the appellant as a businessperson. We agree with the argument
of the assessee that if the network related problems prevent the customers
from using its services, the assessee is bound to suffer reputational damage
and potential loss to business. Addressing the customer's problems promptly
and by a specialized team (which may be an AE) should satisfy the benefit
test, as the assessee received an economic benefit to maintain its business
operation. Therefore in this regard we are of the view that assessee has
substantiated that these services are required by it for its business
sustainability. The only allegation which TPO / DRP made was that the assessee
has not been able to substantiate need test by way of appropriate
documentation and held that the assessee should have availed these services
from an independent third 71 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India)
Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
party in India rather than from its AE. After going through the fact and
submissions placed on record we are of the view that the assessee has
satisfied the need/benefit test for availing these services from its AE.
Regarding the rendition of the services by the AE, the appellant submitted
before the TPO, the copy of inter-company agreements, tickets processed by
GCSC, sample list of project assignment on which GCSC team assisted the
assessee, list of deals on which GSE presales team assisted the assessee. The
assessee also explained the allocation key with details of teams spread across
different countries, copies of invoices etc. For the purposes of
substantiating the services rendered by the assessee it has submitted the
details of all the service rendered by the AE to the assessee as in the paper
book same are placed on sample basis. Therefore, assessee has placed
substantial material evidencing the receipt of the services. Regarding the
receipt of the services from AE, the assessee can be asked to maintain and
produce the evidence of receipt of services, which a businessperson keeps and
maintains regarding services related from the third party. The burden cannot
be higher on the assessee for evidencing the receipt of services of higher
level merely because the services have been rendered by its AE. Against these
evidence placed by the assessee before the lower authorities ld. DRP has
merely stated that assessee has not been able to provide sufficient evidence
and that the AE has provided such services to the assessee. We failed to
understand what ‗sufficient evidence' was and what was lacking in the case of
the assessee. We could not find any instances placed where the TPO / DRP held
that the evidence placed by the assessee are not substantiated by rendition of
service by the AE. The assessee has also relied on the Hon'ble Delhi Tribunal
in the case of GE Money Financial Services Pvt Ltd. Vs ACIT in ITA No.
5882/Del-2010 and TNS India Pvt. Ltd. V. ACIT: (2014) 32 ITR (Trib.) 44 (Hyd.
)whereby on similar facts the Hon'ble Delhi Tribunal has rejected the plea of
the Revenue and has held that for receipt of services, rendering of services
must be seen from the view point of the assessee and further assessee 72 | P a
g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014
(A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 cannot be asked to keep and
maintain evidences of services rendered by AE higher than which is expected
from a businessman receiving services from an unrelated provider. Respectfully
the following the decision of the coordinate the bench we are of the view that
the assessee has justified the receipt of the services and satisfied the
rendition test. Regarding the benefit test, the assessee submitted that owing
to the nature of industry it operates in it requires specialized knowledge and
experience in order to provide seamless services to customers. It has inherent
risks and advantages that can be effectively harnessed only through sharing of
resources and efficiencies that are inbuilt in-scale. Accordingly,
availability of support in terms of strategy, data usage and administration is
essential and indispensable for the assessee in order to achieve cost
efficiency and normal functioning of its business operations. For this reason,
the assessee is availing such essential services from its AEs. For this
purpose, the assessee had entered into an agreement with its AE. These
functions or services, if not availed from the AEs, would have to be
undertaken by the assessee itself. However, due to very nature of network
connectivity services and in order to achieve better economies of scale and
synergies, these functions are centralized within the AE of the assessee which
renders such services. It is, therefore, clear that such services confer a
benefit on the assessee. While examining the arm's length nature of the
impugned international transaction, the learned TPO has applied cost-benefits
test and attempted to map the benefits received against payment made for such
services. While he has concurred with the assessee's contentions regarding
receipt of benefits in respect of several services, for certain other
services, he has erroneously believed that no benefits have been received and
re-determined the ALP on that basis, without appreciating that the same have
benefitted the assessee and accordingly, warrant a payment.

2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
50\. The assessee has also argued that the TPO is only empowered to determine
the ALP of international transaction. It was argued that there is no legal
requirement or mandate for any taxpayer to necessarily undertake a cost-
benefits analysis and a mere absence of such analysis should not necessarily
lead to a pre-conceived notion that no benefits have been received by the
assessee and should not form a basis to disallow the said payment. We also
hasten to add that that for determination of ALP , the benefit to the user
must arise otherwise, it fails the basic test of determining ALP. If there is
no benefit to the user naturally nobody would pay for the services and hence
ALP of such transaction is always Nil because they are worthless. Such is not
the case here. To support its contention, the assessee has relied upon the
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs Cushman and
Wakefield (India) Pvt Ltd. (ITA 475/ 2012), wherein, it was held that the
authority of the TPO is to conduct a TP analysis to determine the ALP and not
to determine whether the tax payer derives a benefit from the service. The
Hon'ble Delhi High Court has opined that the determination of benefit to the
tax payer is not in the domain of the TPO. In this regard, the Appellant also
placed reliance on the following judicial precedents to bring home the point
that the benefit test needs to be satisfied from the view point of assessee
and business prudence :
> a. Ericsson India Private Limited vs Dy CIT [ITA No. 5141/Del/2011 (Delhi
> ITAT)] b. CIT v. EKL Appliances Ltd. [2012] 345 ITR 241 (Delhi) c. Hive
> Communication Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.306/2011) d. Commissioner of Income Tax vs.
> Cushman and Wakefield (India) P. Ltd. (269 CTR 16) (Del.)
51\. The above decisions unanimously holds that in reaching the conclusion
that whether an independent entity would have paid for such services neither
the revenue nor the court must question the 74 | P a g e AT & T Global Network
Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO
2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 commercial wisdom of the assessee or replace its
own assessment of the commercial viability of the transaction. The judicial
precedents also stipulate that the duty of the Ld. TPO is restricted to
determine the ALP of the international transaction and that he cannot replace
his views with the views of the assessee. Respectfully following the binding
precedent cited above we are of the view that benefit test for determination
of Arms length Price is to be viewed from the perspective of the assessee and
businessman and not from the perspective of revenue. In this case appellant
has demonstrated the benefit which it is expected to derive from the various
services rendered by its AE and ld. TPO has erred in replacing with its own
judgment of the benefit derived by the assessee, we reject this approach.
52\. However for determination of arms Length pricing, the assessee has
adopted TNMM as the most appropriate method. The TPO has rejected TNMM as the
most appropriate method and applied the CUP method. For this TPO has not given
any reasoning. In fact, TPO and DRP has not brought out any data on record for
bench marking of intra group transaction and treating the value of services as
NIL by applying the CUP method which is against the basic principles of TP
regulations. Data availability s the life line of any method adopted in
comparability analysis. If there is no data available in that particulars
method then comparability analysis under that method fails. In a scenario
where no data is available to apply the direct methods, one has to resort to
residuary methods for benchmarking a transaction / group of transaction such
as ‗TNMM'. Considering all these factors the Appellant adopted TNMM to
benchmark the transaction. In the absence of any justification by DRP/TPO for
application of CUP, we justify the use of TNMM as the most appropriate method.
75 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
53\. In view of the above findings, we hold that for intra group services
(where the evidences have been furnished), the assessee has satisfied the
need, benefit and rendition test. However we would also like to mention that
out of seven services the assessee has not furnished evidences for following
three services namely- country services, information technology, project
management. In the absence of any evidences, the test of necessity, need and
rendition cannot be commented upon and the assessee is given an opportunity to
furnish the evidences for these three services before the AO/TPO for necessary
verification. The ld TPO may examine them and decide the issue with respect to
those services in accordance with law. With respect to the method as the ld
TPO has not examined the comparability analysis under the TNMM method of Intra
Group services, he must examine the comparability analysis of IGS ( intra
Group Services) and determine ALP.
54\. Another issue which has been raised is the disallowance of royalty
payment which is paid to the overseas entity in the US. In the present case,
the Appellant entered into an understanding with its AE, namely, AT&T Corp.,
vide agreement dated March 7, 2006 for the usage of ‗AT&T' brand. The
consideration for usage between both the parties was agreed @ 4% of net sales.
During the year under consideration the Appellant paid INR 9.34 crores as
royalty to its AE. While benchmarking of royalty transaction, the appellant
adopted TNMM as the MAM on an aggregate basis along with the provision of
network connectivity services. Accordingly, it determined that while the
comparable companies have earned an arithmetic mean of 3.22%, the appellant
earned 4.3%. Accordingly the appellant concluded that the international
transaction pertaining to royalty payment was at arm's length. The appellant
on a without prejudice basis also did the benchmarking of royalty by applying
the CUP method to determine the contemporaneous industry rate of royalty for
brand name paid by other independent companies on similar products. The
assessee 76 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT
ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 concluded that
even by applying the CUP method the payment of royalty was adhering to Indian
TP regulations. The TPO rejected the TNMM approach and adopted CUP as the most
appropriate method. Further TPO also concluded that since the payment of
royalty is not resulting into any benefit its ALP was determined at NIL.
55\. We have gone through the relevant facts of the case and arguments and
submissions advanced by both the parties in connection with the disallowance
of royalty. It was explained to us that the assessee has been granted a non-
exclusive, non-transferable and non-licensable royalty bearing license and was
also granted a right to use the licensed marks in respect of telecommunication
services provided over AT&T's Global Communication Network. An agreement to
this effect was entered into on March 7, 2006 and is already placed on record.
The consideration for the usage between both the parties was priced at 4% of
net sales. For benchmarking of above transaction assessee followed an
aggregated approach since in its view royalty payment was closely linked with
the provision of network connectivity services and cannot be segregated. Hence
assessee benchmarked the royalty transaction using the TNMM approach.
56\. In support of the above, assessee also relied upon the Delhi bench of the
Tribunal in the case of Lumax Industries Limited Vs. ACIT (ITA No.
4456/Del/2012). Relevant extract is produced as under:
> 33\. The TPO has made the disallowance in question mainly on the basis of
> the benefit test. In this regard, it is seen that the payment of royalty
> cannot be examined divorced from the production and sales. Royalty is
> inextricably linked with these activities. In the absence of production and
> sale of products, there would be no question arising regarding payment of
> any royalty. Rule 10A(d) of the ITAT Rules defines ‗transaction' as a number
> of closely linked transactions. Royalty, then, is a transaction closely
> linked with production and sales. It cannot be segregated from these
> activities of an enterprise, being embedded therein. That being so, royalty
> cannot be considered and examined in isolation on a standalone basis.
> Royalty is to be calculated on a specified agreed basis, on determining the
> net sales which, in the present case, are required to be determined after 77

> 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 excluding the

> of the outside party (the assessee) at 4.09% and the comparables at 7.05%.
> This has not been shown to fall outside the permissible range.
57\. On an alternative basis, assessee also submitted a detailed analysis
benchmarking the royalty transaction on CUP basis in the TP documentation. The
finding of the search resulted in the comparable which was identified as below
by the appellant:
       Sr. No Licensor      Licensee        Period         of   Product description                Rate        of
                                            existence      of                                      royalty
                                            agreement
       1       Motorola     Forward         Effective from 1    Trademark license for the use of   7 percent of
               Inc. USA     Industries      January 2008        MOTOROLA signature and M logo      net sales
                            Inc. USA                            (Emsignia)
58\. The aforesaid result demonstrated that the rate of royalty paid by the
Appellant (4% of net sales) is lesser than that paid in an uncontrolled
environment (7% of net sales) and hence it was concluded that the payment of
royalty adheres to the arm's length standard envisaged under Indian TP
regulations. So in view of the assessee, the payment of royalty to its AE is
at Arm's Length under both the above approaches.
59\. On the other hand TPO alleged that the royalty payment being a separate
class of transaction should be benchmarked separately and cannot be aggregated
with the other transactions. In his view, royalty payments and the other
transactions are not closely linked and as such royalty payment is not a
significant part of total cost and does not have much bearing on entity wise
profitability hence TNMM cannot be applied. In his view the royalty
transaction should have been benchmarked using the CUP Method.
78 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
60\. It is a matter of record that TPO nowhere disputed the above alternate
analysis or brought on record any evidence to counter the findings of the
benchmark analysis of royalty using CUP. Rather TPO/DRP proceeded to determine
the ALP at nil by holding the no benefit ever accrued to the assessee by
payment of the royalty.
61\. To justify the need test, the assessee submitted that trade name `AT&T'
has been in existence since the foundation of AT&T Group and has evolved over
decades of Groups' existence. The uniqueness of these intangibles lies in
continuous existence Even though many telecommunication brands exist within
India as well as outside India, the same cannot be considered as substitutes
to AT&T brand, since every brand has its own specific features restricted to
its group entities. Every brand has its own unique selling proposition [LISP),
which tends to differentiate it from other available brands in the market,
thereby creating a niche for itself. A well defined and strong brand helps to
drive sales, build customer loyalty, create brand value, and acts as a
catalyst for business growth, since it differentiates the product or service
offering of a particular company from other available alternatives in the open
market.
62\. To justify the benefit test assessee further submitted that Indian
telecommunications industry is characterized by several telecom players such
as Bharti, Idea, Tata, Vodafone, etc. In such a competitive industry, having a
brand name such as AT&T (which is a globally renowned brand) impacts the
business. It is noteworthy that for more than a century, AT&T Group has
consistently provided innovative, reliable, (nigh-quality products and
services and excellent customer care. It is one of the most stable and trusted
name in communication services around the globe. In 2009 AT&T was ranked 14
out of 500 in the top global brands in the world. Therefore, having 79 | P a g
e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014
(A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 right to use AT&T trademark which
has 'a global presence has helped the assessee in attracting more customers.
63\. Assessee further submitted that customers often select branded product/
Services due to their trust in a variety of factors signified by the brand.
Customers look upon branding as an important value added aspect of a product /
service, as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or
characteristic one cannot ensure :consistent quality of the product / service,
one cannot create a brand Trademark promise to the customer that a stipulated
quality will be maintained and hence the customer can purchase a branded
product believing in its quality which reduces his burden in matters such as,
time in searching, examining for ensuring quality etc. Even in a third party
situation, no prudent businessman would share his reputed brand name/
trademark without any consideration.
64\. Alternatively, assessee also submitted that it is a settled position of
law that the benefit test cannot be applied by TPOs to determine the ALP of
any international transactions. To support his contention the assessee relied
upon the judgment of a coordinate bench Lumax Industries Limited Vs. ACIT (ITA
No. 4456/Del/2012). Further assessee also relied upon the decision of CIT vs
Cushman and Wakefield (India) Pvt Ltd. (ITA 475/ 2012) findings of which we
have already discussed above. We have already held while dealing the issue of
Intra Group Services that the benefit test cannot be seen or be the basis by
the TPO to determine the ALP of a transaction as it is totally the taxpayer's
prerogative.
65\. We therefore accept the plea of assessee and hold that the ld TPO is only
duty bound to determine the ALP of the royalty payments.
66\. With respect to analysis under CUP method by the ld TPO, we fully agree
with him in rejecting internal CUP as it pertains to related 80 | P a g e AT &
T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) &
ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 party transactions which are between its
fellow AEs. We also agree with him in rejecting external CUP data as the
assessee has not submitted any data regarding similarity in terms and
conditions of the royalty agreements. He also rightly held that even from the
limited data submitted are for different industries/ geographical location
/duration and amounts. No analysis of the royalty agreements between the
various parties and the accompanying circumstances and conditions therein has
been done by assessee. We also agree that even a minor difference in royalty
agreement may have a significant effect on the royalty rates.
67\. According to us the royalty payments needs to be tested on the basis of
factum and quantum both aspects. It also needs to be looked at the functions
to be performed by the parties for royalty payments. It also nees to be looked
in to nature of the use of the intangibles which are covered in License
Agreement with AT&T Corp, pursuant to which it was granted the right to use
licensed marks in marketing material for publicity, advertising, signs,
product brochures, instruction manuals and in other form of advertising. These
intangibles, which are licensed to AGNS India, are key value drivers for the
business and benefit it by enabling it to expand its presence in the
marketplace. What would be the duration of payments of such license royalty is
also determinative of the factor of the payments as it cannot also continue
for an indefinite period . It may also happen that India brand because o
consumer may become bigger than AE's brand.
68\. As the assessee has adopted the TNMM which is crude method of
benchmarking royalty payments and Ld TPO has disregarded the transaction only
on the benefit analysis and has also rejected the CUP benchmarking of the
assessee , we are of the view that this issue needs to be set aside to the
file of the ld TPO to determine the ALP of the royalty payments afresh after
examining the method, comparability and then ALP afresh. Assessee is also
directed to 81 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT
ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 support its
ALP determination afresh after submitting the detailed answer to all the
questions raised by the ld TPO in para no 9 of his order except the benefit
test. Hence this ground no 8 of the appeal is allowed with above directions.
69\. Ground no. 9 of the appeal of the Assessee relates to Initiation of
penalty proceedings and Ground 10 of the appeal of the Assessee relates to
levy of interest u/s 234B and 234D of the Act
70\. These grounds are consequential in nature. The appeal by assessee on
these grounds is therefore premature and no interference is called for hence
they are dismissed.
71\. In the result appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
ITA No. 2518/2014 ( D)
72\. Now we now come to the grounds of Departmental Appeal. The first ground
of department appeal is with respect of support service expenditure. The
appellant has incurred support service expenditure of Rs. 1,161,76,903 paid to
its group company i.e. AT&T Communication Services India Private Limited
(‗ACSI') for support services rendered by it. The AO observed that the
assessee failed to justify the claim and that the aforesaid charges have been
paid merely to increase the costs of the assessee and reduce the income for
the current AY. The AO proposed an adjustment of Rs. 1,161,76,903 in the draft
assessment order by giving following reasons:
> ―6.5 In many instances there is overlapping and duplication of work as
> under:
> (a) HR related services have been stated as received by the assessee from
> AT&T CSI. It has been noted on scrutiny of the ledger accounts that separate
> payments have been made directly by the assessee for such services.

(b) Similarly the legal and Tax functions have been described by the assessee
vide its reply dated 25.07.2012 as under:-
―Legal function‖- The Legal function is entrusted with the responsibility of
providing legal advice and legal support to the business and support functions
including inter-alia drafting, negotiating and finalizing contracts and legal
documents; managing secretarial work, ensuring adherence to legal compliances
such as maintenance of register and records and required legal filings with
the authorities. Legal team leads matters involving litigation and dispute
resolution work, assists; provides legal opinions and clarifications and
operational and transactional legal support to the business.
―Tax Function‖ -Tax function is primarily focused on ensuring adherence to
compliances required under different direct and indirect tax law such as
income tax, service tax, customs duty etc. tax function in also responsible
for handling tax related matters pending before various authorities and their
litigation also, it is involved in planning for future tax strategies, keeping
the business informed for the changes in the tax laws and for supporting
business decisions from a tax perspective as and when called upon.‖ For the
above functions as well, the assessee has made direct payments to outside
parties, which goes on to substantiate that payments were being made to
outside parties though it has been claimed that the above functions were
performed by AT&T CSI employees for AGNS.
It may be important to point out here that the assessee has paid separate fees
for ECB certifications to M/s S.R. Batliboi & Associates in addition to the
fees for various audits conducted by them. Similarly, separate fee has been
paid for many other legal, taxation and professional services separately
including fee for tally data entry to M/s R.P. Narang & Co. Technical Fees to
M/s Netlogic Infotech Pvt. Ltd. and to other parties/professionals.

2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 6.6 The assessee has
claimed the deduction for GRE costs, which represents costs allocated by AT&T
CSI towards premises taken on rent by AT&T CSI and shared by the assessee
company. It has been discussed in the assessment order for the previous year
that the premises taken on rent by AT&T CSI have been used by AT&T CSI for its
own business purpose. However, portion of such costs have been allocated to
the assessee company without any justifiable basis.
6.7 In view of the discussions made above, the expenditure on account of
support service cost of Rs. 116,176,903/- is being disallowed and added back
to the total income of the assessee company. Penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c)
are initiated separately for filing inaccurate particulars of income and
thereby concealing income chargeable to tax‖
73\. The assessee preferred objection before the Dispute Resolution Panel who
vide direction dated 30.12.2013 vide para No. 8 has held as under:
> ―8.1 It is in respect of proposed disallowance of Rs. 11,61,76,903/- paid to
> group company namely ACSI towards support services. The AO has proposed
> disallowance of expense of following grounds:
>  The support service agreement between the Taxpayer Company and AT&T
> Communication Services India Pvt. Limited (ACSI) was predated just to
> transfer cost from the group company to the taxpayer company.
>  There is insignificant increase in the employees cost of ACSI which shows
> that no additional employees were hired for provision of support services to
> the taxpayer company.
>  There is overlapping of functions and duplicity of cost incurred by the
> taxpayer company.
>  The business premises used by the taxpayer company were already hired in
> earlier years by ACSI.
8.2 The Ld AR explained that the ACSI, a group company, was having business
activity in India for more than 10 years. It had fully developed support
service functions like 84 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt
Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10
Legal, HR, International Public Affairs, and Global Strategy etc. The
allocation of expenses was on the basis of services received by the taxpayer
company from ACSI. It has also submitted that both companies are tax-paying so
this is not an arrangement for tax avoidance.
8.3 The Panel has examined the issue. The AO has not demonstrated that
services were not rendered by ACSI. He has raised some suspicion. The taxpayer
company, on the other hand, has demonstrated the services were received. The
claim of the taxpayer on this account has been allowed by the Panel in
assessment year 2008-09. The AO has not brought out any new facts for the
current year which are distinguishable from the preceding year. In view of it,
the claim made by the taxpayer deserves to be allowed as incurring of expenses
is not in dispute. The AO is directed to delete the proposed disallowance and
modify the order accordingly.‖
74\. Before us, the ld DR relied upon the draft assessment order whereas the
AR placed the following contentions:
―5.2 The appellant has incurred support service expenditure of Rs.
1,161,76,903 paid to its group company i.e. AT&T Communication Services India
Private Limited (‗ACSI') for support services rendered by it.
5.3 The appellant commenced its business operations during AY 2008-09 and did
not have its own support service functions such as tax, legal, finance, HR
etc., which are necessary and imperative for any business organization to
carry on its business.
5.4 ACSI, a group company of appellant and an entity in operations for more
than 10 years by then, was having fully developed support services functions.
Accordingly, since such functions were already housed in ACSI, appellant
entered into a support services agreement with ACSI for provision of the
aforesaid support services to appellant.
5.5 The agreement filed by in appellant for service support cannot be relied
upon as it has been signed on 30.11.2007 but dated 01.04.2007 and as such its
authenticity is doubtful.
85 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 5.6 As per the terms
of agreement the billing has to be done on monthly basis but the first invoice
is raised for 01.04.2007 till 30.11.2007 and no monthly invoices were raised
till November 2007 which suggests that it is an afterthought just to transfer
some expenses from ACSI to the company.
5.7 Apart from invoices and agreement, the appellant has not been able to
provide any evidence to substantiate that support services were provided by
ACSI to the appellant.
5.8 The appellant has also made payments to outside parties for the same
function which were performed by ACSI employees for the appellant.
Appellant's Submissions before the DRP 5.9 ACSI, a group company of appellant
and an entity in operations for more than 10 years by then, was having fully
developed support services functions. Accordingly, since such functions were
already housed in ACSI, appellant entered into a support services agreement
with ACSI for provision of the aforesaid support services to appellant. The
agreement was intended to achieve optimum utilization of the existing
resources available with the group and to mitigate the costs that would have
been incurred by appellant in establishing its own support services functions.
Copy of support service agreement entered into between ACSI and appellant for
provision of support services was also submitted before the learned AO
(Enclosed at Page 36 - 47 of Paper book Volume - II).
5.10 It is clear from the support service agreement, activities performed by
ACSI under support service agreement are essential and integral to any
business organization. Existence of a business organization without presence
of such support functions (such as legal, tax, HR, IPA support services etc.)
cannot be assumed.
5.11 It was further submitted that the aforesaid support functions were
already established and housed in ACSI and had appellant not availed such
services from ACSI, it would have been required to establish separate teams of
its own to perform such functions. This would have resulted into duplication
of efforts and costs for the group's Indian operations.
86 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No
2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 5.12 Accordingly,
support services cost of Rs. 116,176,903 was allocated by ACSI to appellant,
towards support services rendered by ACSI to appellant.
5.13 Invoices, along with the basis of allocation of expenses incurred by
ACSI, workings of the amounts so invoiced by ACSI to appellant and tax
deducted at source thereon (the same can also be verified from the quarterly
withholding tax statements filed by appellant) were submitted before the
learned AO 5.14 No business would be able to carry out its business operations
efficiently and effectively without the support of the above functions and the
business exigency of such costs cannot be questioned merely on account of the
fact that such costs are incurred by a sister concern of appellant and then
allocated to appellant based on a scientific and reasonable basis. The
aforesaid support functions were already established and housed in ACSI and
had appellant not availed such services from ACSI, it would have been required
to establish separate teams of its own to perform such functions. This would
have resulted into duplication of efforts and costs for the group's Indian
operations.
5.15 At this juncture, it may not be out of place but noteworthy to mention
that both ACSI and appellant are profit making entities and hence, there was
no tax incentive for the parties to deflate the revenues earned by appellant.
By transferring the cost from ACSI to appellant no added tax advantage is
being availed by appellant.
5.16 Further regarding commercial expediency of the said support services
expenditure it is submitted that commercial expediency of a particular
expenditure incurred by a businessman would be examined from the perspective
of the business person and no third party, including the tax authorities, is
entitled to question the commercial reasoning/justification of the expenditure
so incurred. The Courts have also held that the Revenue authorities do not
have the power to disallow expenses on the ground of reasonableness of
expenditure or benefit arising there from.
5.17 Reliance in this regard is placed on the following judicial precedents:
-CIT v. Panipat Woollen & General Mills Co Ltd (103 ITR 66) (Supreme Court) "That in order to determine the question of reasonableness of the expenditure, the test of commercial expediency would 87 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services (India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y 2009-10 have to be adjudged from the point of view of the businessman and not of the income-tax department. It is well settled that the court in order to construe on agreement has to look to the substance or the essence of it rather than to its form." 
-CIT v. Sales Magnesite (P) Ltd [1995) 214 ITR 1 "To hold it to be an expenditure allowable as a deduction under section 37, it is not essential that it should be necessary, legally or otherwise, to incur the same or that it should directly and immediately benefit the business of the assessee. Even expenditure incurred voluntarily on the ground of commercial expediency and in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business would be deductible under this section. The question whether it was necessary for commercial expediency or not is a question that has to be decided from the point of view of the businessman and not by the subjective standard of reasonableness of the Revenue." 
-Binodiram Balchand vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (48 1TR 548) 
-Calcutta Landing and Shipping Co Ltd vs. CIT (65 ITR 1) (Cal High Court) 5.18 The Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court of Delhi, in the case of CIT Vs B Dalmia Cement Ltd (254 ITR 377) held that reasonableness of the business expenditure can be judged only from the point of view of a businessman. No businessman can be compelled to maximize his profits. 
5.19 Applying the principles laid down in the aforesaid judicial precedents to
the present case, it clear that once it is established that appellant has
actually incurred the aforesaid support services cost for the purposes of
availing support services rendered by ACSI no expenditure cannot be disallowed
on the premise of commercial expediency/ need for incurring such expenditure.‖
75\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the facts
of the case. The facts of the case as explained by the appellant are that,
ACSI, a group company of appellant and an entity in operations for more than
10 years by then, was having developed support services functions.
Accordingly, since such functions were already housed in ACSI, appellant
entered into a support services 88 | P a g e AT & T Global Network Services
(India) Pvt Ltd V DCIT ITA No 2538/Del/2014 (A) & ITA NO 2518/Del/2014 (D) A Y
2009-10 agreement with ACSI for provision of the aforesaid support services to
appellant. We have gone through the submission of the assessee and find that
necessary evidences in the form of the support service agreement, invoices,
the details of payments made and the bank statements evidencing the payment
thereof have been furnished by the assessee to prove the genuineness of the
expenses. We find that no evidence has been brought on record by the
Department to dispute the said claim. Rather, the Department's claim is merely
based on suspicion as also noted by the DRP while deleting the above
disallowance. We also find that even otherwise, both ACSI and appellant are
profit making entities and hence, there was no tax incentive for the parties
to deflate the revenues earned by appellant. The decision was totally based on
commercial considerations. By transferring the cost from ACSI to appellant no
added tax advantage is being availed by appellant. We are also of the view
that commercial expediency of a particular expenditure incurred by a
businessman should be examined from the perspective of the business person and
no third party, including the tax authorities, is entitled to question the
commercial reasoning/justification of the expenditure so incurred. Reliance in
this regard is placed on the following judicial precedents furnished by the
assessee:
> i. CIT v. Panipat Woollen & General Mills Co Ltd (103 ITR
> 66) (Supreme Court) ii. CIT v. Sales Magnesite (P) Ltd [1995) 214 ITR 1 iii.
> Binodiram Balchand vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (48 1TR 548) iv. Calcutta
> Landing and Shipping Co Ltd vs. CIT (65 ITR
> 1) (Cal High Court) v. CIT Vs B Dalmia Cement Ltd (254 ITR 377)
76\. Respectfully following the principles laid down in the aforesaid judicial
precedents, we find that where the appellant has actually incurred the
aforesaid support services cost and no evidence has been brought by 89 | P a g
