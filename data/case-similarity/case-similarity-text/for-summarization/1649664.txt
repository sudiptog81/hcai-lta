JUDGMENT Gurdev Singh, J.
13\. This order will dispose of L.P.As. Nos. 515 to 527, 669 to 680, 698 and
700 of 1970, L.P. As. Nos. 12, 13, 22, 48 and 325 of 1971 and Civil Writ No.
96 of 1971 as they raise a common question relating to the liability of cotton
seed extracted in the process of ginning cotton to purchase tax. These L.P.
As. have been preferred by the State of Punjab against the judgment of a
learned single Judge, holding that the petitioner-company was not required to
include in its turnover the purchase of unginned cotton when it was not the
last purchaser thereof, irrespective of the fact that cotton seeds remained
with it. In the writ petitions out of which these appeals have arisen as well
as in Civil Writ No. 96 of 1971, the assessing authority under the Punjab
Sales Tax Act had held that the cotton seed extracted in the process of
ginning cotton is liable to purchase tax. In holding that it was not liable to
sales tax in the hands of the person ginning the cotton, the learned single
purchaser, thereof.
20\. The learned single Judge, while disposing of Civil Writ No. 2494 of 1969,
which is the subject-matter of L.P.A. No. ,515 of 1970, has, on consideration
of the legal position, observed :
The petitioner-company was not required to include in its turnover the
purchase of cotton when it was not the last purchaser thereof irrespective of
the fact that cotton seeds remained with it.
21\. This is the basis on which the decisions in all these cases proceed.
These observations, if I may say so with respect, are in accord with the
dictum of their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the cases noticed above. I,
thus, see no infirmity in the judgments under appeal before us to warrant
interference. I would, accordingly, dismiss all the Letters Patent appeals
(detailed in the opening part of this judgment) and allow Civil Writ No. 96 of
1971. The impugned orders in the latter case are quashed. The assessing
authority will, however, be at liberty to make fresh assessments in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and in the light of the observations made
sales tax in the hands of the person ginning the cotton, the learned single
Judge has relied upon the Supreme Court decision in State of Punjab and Ors.
v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 1073 wherein it was observed as
follows :
But it is by a manufacturing process that the cotton and the seeds are
separated and it is not correct to say that the seeds so separated is cotton
itself or part of the cotton. They are two distinct commercial goods though
before the manufacturing process the seeds might have been a part of the
cotton itself. There is, hence, no warrant for the contention that cotton seed
is not different from cotton. It follows that the respondent is not entitled
to deduct the sale price of the cotton seeds from the purchase turnover under
Section 5(2)(a)(vi) of the Act. In our opinion, the assessing authority was
right in holding that the respondent was not entitled to deduction in respect
of cotton seeds sold by it to registered dealers.
14\. In following this judgment, the learned single Judge observed:
In this judgment, their Lordships held that cotton ginned or un-ginned is a
single commodity and is to be treated as a single species of declared goods
and cannot be subject, under Section 5(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, to a
tax exceeding two per cent, of the sale or purchase price thereof or at more
than one stage. Their Lordships further held that cotton seeds are not
'cotton' and no deduction can be allowed on account of the sale proceeds of
the cotton seeds extracted from unginned cotton and sold to the registered
dealers under Section 5(2)(a)(vi) of the Act, but deduction was admissible in
respect of the ginned cotton obtained from the unginned cotton by the process
of manufacture if the same was sold to a registered dealer under the said
provision.
It is quite apparent that in view of the addition of Section 5(3) to the Act,
this method of assessment in respect of cotton is not permissible. Cotton
being declared goods and only liable to purchase tax, the last dealer liable
to pay this tax has to be found. This finding has not been given by the
assessing authority although it was necessary to be given in view of the fact
that the petitioner-company had denied that it was the last purchaser to pay
the tax. The question, however, arises whether the petitioner-company can be
said to be the last purchaser of cotton in the present case, in view of the
admitted fact that the ginned cotton extracted out of the unginned cotton
purchased by the petitioner-company was sold to registered dealers. Cotton
ginned or unginned is to be considered as a single commodity, according to
their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the case referred to above. It shall
have to be presumed that the unginned cotton purchased by the petitioner-
company was sold by it to registered dealers in the form of ginned cotton. If
no part of the unginned cotton or ginned cotton obtained therefrom remained
with the petitioner-company, it could not be said to be the last purchaser of
cotton liable to pay tax under the Act, merely because cotton seeds, a by-
product from the unginned cotton by process of manufacture, have remained with
the petitioner-company, for cotton seeds cannot be said to be cotton...The
fact that the cotton seeds have remained with the petitioner is not to be
taken into consideration, for that purpose.
15\. Under the Punjab Sales Tax Act as amended by Act 7 of 1967 both cotton
and cotton seeds are "declared goods" on which admittedly the tax has to be
paid by the last purchaser. Now, it is firmly settled that the word "cotton"
includes both ginned and unginned cotton and even after ginning when ginned
cotton and cotton seeds are obtained, we have to find who is the last
purchaser of cotton. If the entire ginned cotton is sold away after ginning,
then obviously the purchaser who carried out the process of ginning is not the
last purchaser of cotton. Thus, he is not liable to purchase tax. In that
case, we have to find out who is the last purchaser.
16\. So far as cotton seeds are concerned, it, according to the learned
counsel for the State, is a by-product of ginning and thus entirely a new
commodity. It, therefore, he argues, follows that before it is subjected to
purchase tax, the assessing authority has to find out who the last purchaser
is. Cotton seeds separated in the process of ginning cannot be said to have
been purchased by the person carrying out the ginning process. If entire
ginned cotton obtained out of the unginned cotton is sold away, it follows
that no cotton is consumed by the person carrying out the process of ginning
and, as such, the by-product in the form of cotton seeds obtained cannot be
subjected to purchase tax. Chandu Lal's case A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 1073 very
recently came up for consideration before their Lordships of the Supreme Court
in State of Punjab v. Shakti Cotton Co. [1972] 29 S.T.C. 706 (S.C.) Civil
Appeal No. 2319 of 1968, decided on 5th November, 1971 (along with some other
decisions bearing on the point). Dealing with this case, Vaidialingam, J.,
speaking for the court observed as follows:
The decision in the State of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal and,
Ors., can at the most be considered to have decided that cotton seeds are not
declared goods and that it is by the manufacturing process that cotton and
cotton seeds are separated. As the Act, as amended by the Amendment Act, has
to be applied in respect of assessment of sales tax on declared goods, the
decision in the State of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal and Ors.
is, in our opinion, no bar to the assessees urging their objections regarding
the validity of the orders of assessment. Further, this court had no occasion
to consider in the State of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal and
Ors., whether, when unginned cotton has been purchased and the entire quantity
of ginned cotton obtained therefrom has been sold, the price obtained from the
latter is 'a turnover on the purchase of goods which are sold' within the
meaning of Section 5(2)(a)(vi), even on the basis that the said provision
applies. Further, in the said decision, this court had no occasion to consider
the question whether purchase price or sale price has to be taken into account
under Clause (vi), nor had it occasion to consider the question whether the
mere sale of cotton seeds, even though the entire ginned cotton obtained from
unginned cotton originally purchased, had been sold, will make any difference
in such circumstances. All these matters have neither been adverted to nor
considered by this court in the said decision. In fact, if we may say so with
respect, when an assessment under the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960, in
respect of declared goods is illegal, the question what deduction, if any,
should or should not be allowed in calculating the turnover in respect of such
goods, should not at all arise.
17\. Later, adverting to the same decision, his Lordship said :
...we make it clear .that in the fresh assessment proceedings, the assessing
authority has to consider the matter, in the light of the provisions of the
Amendment Act incorporated in the Act; and the decision of this court in the
State of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal and Ors. A.I.R. 1969 S.C.
1073 cannot operate to the prejudice of the assessees. We have already made it
clear that the said decision has decided the question of assessment of
declared goods under the provisions of the Act, as they stood on April 1,
1960, which provisions have no application for levy of sales tax in respect of
declared goods as held by this court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. [1967] 3
S.C.R. 577 and two other cases, referred to above. Therefore, the fresh
revised assessments will have to be made, without reference to the decision in
the State of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal and Ors., which
decision has no application, when the question has to be now decided, on the
basis of the Act, as amended by the Amendment Act." It is, thus, apparent that
the decision in Chandu Lal's case A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 1073 cannot form the basis
of decision in this case and the matter will have to be decided on the rule
laid down by their Lordships of the Supreme Court recently in the State of
Punjab v. Shakti Cotton Company [1972] 29 S.T.C. 706 (S.C.) Civil Appeal No.
2319 of 1968, decided on 5th November, 1971. In this latest decision, by which
seven appeals against the judgment and orders of the Punjab High Court were
disposed of, the controversy related to the assessment of sales tax in respect
of cotton, which is admittedly an item of declared goods under Schedule 'C' to
the Act. Adverting to the facts of the case of Shakti Cotton Company, one of
the seven cases which their Lordships were considering, we find that the
company claimed deduction under Section 5(2)(a)(vi) from its gross turnover,
value of the entire quantity of cotton it had purchased. This deduction was,
however, disallowed and the order of the assessing authority was challenged in
the Supreme Court (sic) by means of Civil Writ No. 452 of 1964. The firm's
claim before the assessing authority was that if 3 maunds of kapas is ginned
it gives roughly one maund of ginned cotton which if disposed of in toto
should be equivalent to the purchase price of three maunds of kapas originally
purchased. The assessing authority proceeding on this basis allowed deduction
of 1/3rd of the total price paid for the unginned cotton, and held that the
amount realised by the firm by sale of cotton seeds as a result of ginning
cannot be taken into account for calculating the turnover under Section
5(2)(a)(vi) of the Punjab Act, as the said material is not cotton but
something different. The State, defending the validity of the assessment
order, reiterated that cotton seeds are different from cotton and the price
realised by the sale of the former did not qualify for deduction under the
said provision of the Punjab Act as the cotton seeds are not, the same
commodity as cotton that had been originally purchased. The learned single
Judge of this court, who dealt with this matter, being of the opinion that
full deduction permissible to a dealer under Section 5(2)(a)(vi) of the Act as
laid down by the Division Bench in Patel Cotton Company Private Ltd. v. The
State of Punjab and Ors. [1964] 15 S.T.C. 805 having not been granted to the
firm, allowed the petition and directed the Sales Tax Officer to redecide the
matter and make an assessment order in accordance with the rule laid down in
Patel Cotton Company's case [1964] 15 S.T.C. 805. It is against that order
that Shakti Cotton Company approached the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.
2319 of 1968, [1972] 29 S.T.C. 706 (S.C.).
18\. Their Lordships after noticing in detail the history of the relevant
provisions of the sales tax legislation and the amendments made consequent
upon the decision of that court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. v. The State of
Punjab and Anr. A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 1616 adverted to their own decision in State
of Punjab and Ors. v. Chandu Lal Kishori Lal A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 1073 in which it
had been held that cotton seed obtained after ginning was not cotton but a
different material. Their Lordships, however found that in deciding Chandu
Lal's case, earlier decisions of the Supreme Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills'
case and Patel Cotton Company's case, had not been considered. Accordingly,
Vaidialingam, J., who delivered the, judgment of the court observed that the
decision in Chandu Lal's case A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 1073 is not to form the basis
of assessment and it could at the most be considered to have decided that the
cotton seeds were not declared goods.
19\. What emerges from the recent decision of the Supreme Court in State of
Punjab v. Shakti Cotton Company, Civil Appeal No. 2319 of 1968, is that cotton
seed is not cotton but a different commodity. In fact, it is admitted that now
it is one of the items of declared goods under Schedule 'C'. Learned counsel
for the State has urged that in this situation, no deduction in respect of
these goods can be claimed. Even if that be so, the fact remains that as a
result of ginning cotton seeds and ginned cotton are obtained. Ginned cotton
admittedly is cotton and an item of declared goods. There is no controversy
about it and there cannot be. Deduction on account of ginned cotton is
permissible. The question that remains to be considered is, whether a dealer
is liable to purchase tax in a case where he sells the entire ginned cotton
that he had obtained after ginning, out of the unginned cotton purchased by
him. It is obvious that if he had sold the entire cotton, though after the
process of ginning, he has not consumed or retained any cotton as such and
thus, the entire purchase price of the cotton so used for ginning can be
claimed as deduction. So far as the cotton seed is concerned, there is no
question of its being subjected to purchase tax in the hands of the person
obtaining it by ginning of unginned cotton once he has sold away the entire
ginned cotton that he obtained as a result of ginning. In this view of the
matter, the tax on cotton will have to be levied on the person who is the last
purchaser, thereof.
20\. The learned single Judge, while disposing of Civil Writ No. 2494 of 1969,
which is the subject-matter of L.P.A. No. ,515 of 1970, has, on consideration
of the legal position, observed :
The petitioner-company was not required to include in its turnover the
purchase of cotton when it was not the last purchaser thereof irrespective of
the fact that cotton seeds remained with it.
21\. This is the basis on which the decisions in all these cases proceed.
These observations, if I may say so with respect, are in accord with the
dictum of their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the cases noticed above. I,
thus, see no infirmity in the judgments under appeal before us to warrant
interference. I would, accordingly, dismiss all the Letters Patent appeals
(detailed in the opening part of this judgment) and allow Civil Writ No. 96 of
1971. The impugned orders in the latter case are quashed. The assessing
authority will, however, be at liberty to make fresh assessments in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and in the light of the observations made
above. I would, however, leave the parties to bear their own costs in all
these cases.
