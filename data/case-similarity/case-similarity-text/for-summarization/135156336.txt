[corresponding to ground 4.2] 4.3 Disregarding application of multiple year/
prior year data as used by the Appellant in the TP documentation and holding

[corresponding to ground 6] Other than transfer pricing matters On the facts
and in the circumstances of the case and in law:

b) Without prejudice to the above, the learned Assessing Officer erred in

of the aforesaid grounds of _appeal at any time before or at the time of
hearing of the appeal, so as to enable the Hon'ble Tribunal to decide on the
appeal in accordance with the law."
2\. The assessee has also moved an application for admission of additional
grounds which are reproduced hereunder:-
> IT(TP)A No.1230/Bang/2011  Page 6 of 8 "4.5 On the facts and in the
> circumstances of the case and in law, the Transfer Pricing Officer erred in
> introducing Helios & Matheson Information Technology Limited and Thirdware
> Solutions Limited in its comparability analysis which are functionally
> dissimilar Appellant in respect of its provision of contract software
> development services (IT).
> 4.6 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the TPO
> erred in introducing Iservices India Private Limited in its comparability
> analysis which is functionally dissimilar to the Appellant in respect of its
> provision of shared services (ITeS).
> 4.7 On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the TPO
> erred in introducing Miton Corp Limited in its comparability analysis
> without considering the peculiar facts about the company which make it unfit
> to be held as a good comparable for benchmarking provision of shared
> services (ITeS).
> It is prayed that the above companies be excluded from the set of
> comparables considered by the TPO for comparability analysis.
> The Appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend or withdraw all or any of
> the Grounds of Appeal and to submit such statements, documents and papers as
> may be considered necessary either at or before the appeal hearing."
3\. During the course of hearing, the ld. counsel for the assessee has invited
our attention that though the DRP has reproduced the assessee's contentions
and TPO's finding with regard to exclusion/inclusion of comparables, but they
themselves have not examined the issue in the light of assessee's contentions.
Only in one para they have adjudicated the issue of exclusion/inclusion of
comparables and finally concluded that no interference is called for in the
order of the TPO.
IT(TP)A No.1230/Bang/2011  Page 7 of 8
4\. During the course of hearing, both the parties have agreed that since the
DRP has not adjudicated the contentions of the assessee by passing a reasoned
order, the matter should be restored back to their file with a direction to
reajdudicate the contentions of the assessee with regard to
exclusion/inclusion of comparables by applying different filters. The ld.
counsel for the assessee, however, submitted that since the assessee has also
raised additional grounds of appeal before the Tribunal, the same should also
be considered by the DRP while adjudicating the issue of transfer pricing.
5\. Having carefully examined the order of the DRP and the TPO, we find that
the DRP has not applied its mind to the contentions of the assessee and
findings of the TPO. It has summarily rejected the contentions of the assessee
and approved the action of the TPO by passing a cryptic order, whereas the DRP
is supposed to pass a reasoned order analyzing the contentions of the assessee
in the light of TPO's order.
Since the DRP has not passed a reasoned order adjudicating the contentions of
the assessee, we set aside the order of the DRP and restore the matter back to
their file with a direction to readjudicate the issue of transfer pricing
determining the ALP for international transactions in the light of assessee's
contentions for exclusion/inclusion of the comparables.
Since the assessee has also filed additional grounds of appeal and the entire
issue is restored to the DRP, the DRP may also consider the additional grounds
of appeal raised before the Tribunal while adjudicating IT(TP)A
No.1230/Bang/2011  Page 8 of 8 the issue of transfer pricing. Accordingly, the
order of the DRP is set aside and the matter is restored to the file of DRP to
readjudicate the issues afresh in the terms indicated above.
6\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
