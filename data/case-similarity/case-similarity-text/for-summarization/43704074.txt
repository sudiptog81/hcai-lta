examination they were bound to explore the remedy in the law instead they
participated in the fresh process of selection and upon being unsuccessful and
dismissal they challenged in these writ petitions. This was clearly not open
to the petitioners.
The principles of estoppel would operate. The case relied by the learned
counsel for the respondent State is applicable in the facts and circumstances
of the case of Ashok Kumar & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Ors." supra. Moreover,
the Medical Board reports are not under  27 challenge in these writ petitions.
The JSSC has already issued the appointment letters in view of further medical
board report. The illegality has been admitted by the State as indicated in
order dated 11.08.2017.
22\. As a cumulative effect of above discussions and findings, the Court comes
to a definite conclusion that no relief can be extended to the petitioners in
these writ petitions.
23\. Accordingly, these writ petitions being W.P.(S) No.4489 of 2018, W.P.(S)

Ranjan Pd. Ram, Advocate [WPS No.5001 of 2018] Mr. A.K. Sahani, Advocate [WPS

the Respondents : Mr. Sanjoy Piprawal, Advocate [Jhar.Staff Selection

No.3239 of 17]
\----------
C.A.V. on 09.07.2020 PRONOUNCED ON 05/08/2020 All these writ petitions, along
with W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017 have been heard together.
2\. These writ petitions have been heard through Video Conferencing in view of
the guidelines of the High Court taking into account the situation arising due
to COVIC-19 pandemic. None of the parties have complained about any technical
snag of audio-video and with their consent these matters had been heard on
merits.
3\. Since all these matters, except in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017, the challenge
is of dismissal from service by the petitioners that is why the Court thought
it proper to pass separate order in all these writ petitions.
4\. The facts of all these writ petitions, except W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017, are
almost the same and that is why W.P.(S) No.4489 of 2018 is being taken as a
lead case.
5\. The petitioners have preferred these writ petitions for quashing the order
dated 03.07.2018, 27.07.2018 and 01.08.2018.
6\. Pursuant to Advertisement No.4 of 2015 issued by the  5 Jharkhand Staff
Selection Commission [JSSC] for appointment on the post of constable,
Jharkhand Armed Police, the petitioners applied and they have been issued
Admit Card. The petitioners were declared successful in the preliminary test
examination, main examination and the result was also published in which the
petitioners were declared successful. The petitioners appeared for
verification of the documents. The roll numbers of the petitioners were
disclosed in paragraph no.12 of the writ petition. After verification of the
documents, the final merit list was prepared and the roll number of the
petitioners mentioned in the final merit list.
The petitioner nos. 1 to 5 have been medically examined by the Civil Surgeon
and they have been declared as medically fit for appointment. The petitioner
no.5 was also examined on 07.01.2015 and declared medically fit for
appointment. The appointment letter issued in favour of the petitioners by
order dated 30.03.2017, 28.04.2017 and 23.05.2017 respectively. The
petitioners were declared medically fit by the Civil Surgeon. Thereafter, the
petitioners were sent for the training. The petitioners have been dismissed
from service by order dated 03.07.2018, 27.07.2018 and 01.08.2018.
7\. Aggrieved with this, the petitioners have moved before this Court in these
writ petitions challenging the dismissal order with a prayer therein to
reinstate the petitioners.
8\. Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the
petitioners has submitted that the petitioners were twice examined by the
medical board and thereafter the petitioners  6 were appointed. He submitted
that the petitioners were sent for the training and they have passed their
hard training of 169 days. He further submitted that in absence of any
departmental proceeding and any show cause the petitioners have been dismissed
from service. He further submitted that in view of Annexure-"A" series of the
counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent no.6, the petitioners were
said to be not medically fit. He submitted that these are the documents of
certificate of medical fitness issued by the apex medical board constituted in
terms of the order of this Court dated 11.08.2017passed in W.P.(S) No.3239 of
2017 for the sake of convenience, the said order is quoted hereinbelow:
> "Heard Mr. Shresth Gautam, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
> petitioners, learned Advocate General, appearing on behalf of the State and
> Mr. Sanjay Piprawal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Jharkhand Staff
> Selection Commission.
> In this writ petition, the petitioners have prayed for a direction upon the
> respondents to declare the 36 writ petitioners as medically fit and to be
> considered for appointment to the post of Constable in Jharkhand Armed
> Police (JAP).
> The petitioners claims that they have passed the preliminary test as well as

> in the merit list, which was prepared after the main examination. The
> petitioners thereafter, were sent for medical test and they were declared
> successful but their appointments were not made. The petitioner could come

It is the case of the petitioners that they could come to know that on the
ground of knock-knee or flat feet etc., they were disqualified. The counsel
for the petitioners  7 submits and pleads that the petitioners were forced to
sign on blank sheets, which were converted into their acknowledgment of the
Medical Board. The petitioners then got themselves suo motu medically examined
by Civil Surgeon, Sadar Hospital, Ranchi. It was found that the petitioners do
not suffer from the aforesaid infirmity and on this ground, the petitioners
have moved this Court.
Counter affidavit was filed by the State and also by the Jharkhand Staff
Selection Commission.
The medical board was constituted as per Rules for the medical examination of
the petitioners. The report of the Medical Board was brought on record in
respect of these present 36 petitioners by the respondents. This report
suggests that these 36 petitioners were declared medically unfit. Since, there
were two divergent views; one by the Medical Board and one by the Medical
Officer of the Sadar Hospital (both being the Government Servants), this Court
vide order dated 7th July, 2017 requested the Assistant Solicitor General of
India to assist this Court in getting these 36 petitioners examined by a
Neutral Medical Board. The Assistant Solicitor General of India suggested that
these 36 petitioners should be got examined by the DIG, Medical, C.R.P.F.,
Ranchi Composite Hospital, Sambo, Ranchi.
This Court vide order dated 7th July, 2017 thus directed the petitioners to
appear before the DIG, Medical, C.R.P.F., Ranchi Composite Hospital, Sambo,
Ranchi, with a request to the DIG to get these petitioners medically examined
and submit a report to this Court.
Pursuant to the direction of this Court, 35 petitioners, appeared before the
Medical Board, constituted by the DIG, Medical, C.R.P.F., Ranchi Composite
Hospital, Sambo, Ranchi. The said Medical Board was constituted of three
Medical Officers of C.R.P.F. presided over by Dr. M.K. Sinha, CMO(SG), (Ortho
Specialist), CH, CRPF, Neemuch, Dr. Bithika Singh, CMO (SG), CH, CRPF BBSR and
Dr. S.K. Parimal, Eye Specialist (Cont.), CH, CRPF, Ranchi. The Medical Board
of CRPF found that 30 petitioners out of 35 petitioners were found medically
fit. One petitioner i.e. petitioner No. 11 has not appeared before the Board
and rest five petitioners, whose names are appearing at Sl. Nos. 18, 19, 22,
24 and 36 were found medically unfit.
8
In view of the report of the Medical Board of the CRPF, this Court, prima
facie, expressed opinion that large scale wrong/illegalities/irregularities
have been committed by the Medical Board in relation to the appointment of
constables and an order was passed on 28.7.2017 to this effect, as the total
number of vacancies were approximately 7000 in the advertisement.
Mr. Ajit Kumar, the learned AAG (as he then was) on 28.7.2017 prayed to defer
the matter for seeking instructions from the State as to what action can be
taken in this case and to suggest how the wrong/illegalities/irregularities
can be undone. Today, the State has filed a counter affidavit suggesting
remedial measures, which the State intends to take in this matter.
This Court has taken note of the fact notes that the State has not questioned
the report of the medical Board of CRPF in respect of 30 petitioners, who
appeared before the Board. Mr. Ajit Kumar (now the Advocate General of the
State) submits that the State has got no intention to challenge the findings
of the Medical Board of CRPF so far as these 36 petitioners are concerned.
The learned A.G. refers to paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit, filed today,
which is sworn by one Chandra Prakash Pandey, Under Secretary, Department of
Home, Prisons and Disaster Management, Govt. of Jharkhand, Ranchi, and submits
the measure which the State intends to take to remedy the illegalities. It is
necessary to quote paragraph 14 of the said affidavit, which reads as under:-
"14. That it is further submitted that the office of the answering respondent
also issued letter No. 4193 dated 29.7.17 to the DGP seeking a report with
opinion with respect to the direction's contained in the aforementioned order
of this Hon'ble Court in the captioned matter. The Chairman, JSSC and the DGP,
Jharkhand, sent their response vide letter No. 1482 dated 2.8.2012 and letter
No. 1074 dated 2.8.2017 respectively.
In the light of the report/opinion of the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission
and the Police Head Quarters, the State Government has approved following
course of action:-
(i) An Appellate/Apex Medical Board may be constituted  9 comprising a
specialists/Senior Medical Officer for medical test.
(ii) Since this matter is related to competitive Examination conducted by
Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission, remedical examination of those
candidates, who secured higher marks in the merit list than that of category
wise the recommended candidates,may be conducted.
(iii) The candidates fulfilling the criteria at serial (ii) of the decision
shall submit their earlier medical report to the appellate/Apex Medical Board
and the said Board shall submit its opinion/report after examining the
candidates afresh.
The Appellate/Apex Medical Board shall also examine the records/medical
reports issued by the earlier medical Board. The said Board shall also report
as to whether any false report has been submitted by the earlier constituted
medical Board.
The Appellate/Apex Medical Board shall identify such medical officers
submitting false report and shall forward the same to the department of
Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare and the said department in turn,
would proceed with disciplinary and legal actions against the erring medical
officer.
(iv) For the aforementioned medical reexamination a committee may be
constituted by the Department of Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare
comprising Director-in-Chief of Health Services with Officer of the rank of
Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary in order to ensure transparent and fair
medical test.
(v) Digital Camera/CCTV may be installed at the place of Medical Test in order
to maintain transparent and fair Medical Test.
Medical Test of the candidates shall be conducted after due physical
verification through Biometric System.
(vi) For such type of competitive examination for appointment in different
cadres to be held in future a provision may be made for appeal before the
Appellate/Apex Medical Board for such candidates who fail in medical test by
the medical board wherever medical test is mandatory for selection of
candidates.
(vii) A fresh revised merit list may be prepared after the  10 candidates are
declared fit by the Appellate/Apex Medical Board and accordingly selected
candidates may be appointed against the vacancies."
From perusal of paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit, this Court feels that
the State has intention to correct the wrong/ illegalities/ irregularities
committed by the Medical Board.
Thus, keeping in view of paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit, I direct the
State to take appropriate action in terms of their undertaking given in the
said paragraph within three months from today. After completing the fresh
medical examination, the State will prepare a fresh Merit list. After
preparing the fresh merit list of each category, the State will also issue
fresh appointment letter to the selected candidates as per the fresh merit
list and the State will also take an appropriate action to remove the
candidates who are found medically unfit in reexamination and have been
appointed. Also the persons whose name will not find place in the fresh merit
list, prepared after medical reexamination, if already appointed, will also be
removed, as their appointment will be illegal and void. So far as fresh
medical examination is concerned, the State undertakes to conduct the same in
terms of paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit, filed today. This Court also
directs that 30 petitioners, except the petitioners whose names are appearing
at Sl. Nos. 11, 18, 19, 22, 24 and 36, will be treated to be medically fit and
they will not be subject to medical reexamination.
The State will also give notice to the last selected candidates of each
category to be medically re-examined because there is possibility that after
conducting fresh medical re- examination, the position in the merit list and
the cut off marks may change in each category. The State is also directed to
declare the marks of the last selected candidate, as per statement given in
paragraph 14 of the said counter affidavit. After completing the entire
process, the State will file an affidavit, which must be sworn by the
Secretary of the Department. The affidavit will suggest about the action which
has been taken or intended to be taken against the Medical Board, who have
wrongly disqualified these 30 petitioners.
Let a copy of this order be handed over to Mr. Vikash Kumar, learned J.C. to
A.G. for necessary  11 communication.
List this case after three months."
9\. Referring to the said order passed in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017 Mr. Sinha,
the learned Senior counsel has submitted that there was no occasion to pass
such order against the petitioners as the petitioners were not party in that
writ petition. He further submitted that as there is the order of the High
Court in that view of the mater, the petitioners appeared in the re-
constituted medical board. He further submitted that without any show cause
and departmental proceeding the petitioners' services have been terminated
ignoring the fact that they have completed police training and they have been
declared medically fit by the board. Referring to different paragraphs of the
counter affidavit of the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission, he submitted
that the fact has been admitted by the JSSC about constituting medical board,
appointment of the petitioners, training and continuing in service. By way of
referring to paragraph no.22 of the writ petition, he submitted that there is
averment that no show cause has been issued to the petitioners. He referred to
counter affidavit and submitted that this fact has been admitted in the
counter affidavit that no show cause has been issued to the petitioners. He
further submitted that the counter affidavit of the State and the JSSC are
contradictory. Mr. Sinha, the learned Senior counsel, to substantiate his
arguments, relied in the case of "Ratnesh Kumar Choudhary v. Indira Gandhi
Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar & Ors." reported in AIR 2016 SC
467. Paragraph nos.27 and 28 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow:
12
"27. In the facts of the case, the Court proceeded to state that there is a
marked distinction between the concepts of satisfactory completion of
probation and successful passing of the training/test held during or at the
end of the period of probation, which are sine qua non for confirmation of a
probationer and the Bank's right to punish a probationer for any defined
misconduct, misbehaviour or misdemeanour. In a given case, the competent
authority may, while deciding the issue of suitability of the probationer to
be confirmed, ignore the act(s) of misconduct and terminate his service
without casting any aspersion or stigma which may adversely affect his future
prospects but, if the misconduct/misdemeanour constitutes the basis of the
final decision taken by the competent authority to dispense with the service
of the probationer albeit by a non-stigmatic order, the Court can lift the
veil and declare that in the garb of termination simpliciter, the employer has
punished the employee for an act of misconduct.
28\. In the case at hand, it is clear as crystal that on the basis of a
complaint made by a member of the Legislative Assembly, an enquiry was
directed to be held. It has been innocuously stated that the complaint was
relating to illegal selection on the ground that the appellant did not possess
the requisite qualification and was appointed to the post of Chest Therapist.
The report that was submitted by the Cabinet (Vigilance) Department eloquently
states about the conduct and character of the appellant. The stand taken in
the counter affidavit indicates about the behaviour of the appellant. It is
also noticeable that the authorities after issuing the notice to show cause
and obtaining a reply from the delinquent employee did not supply the
documents. Be that as it may, no regular enquiry was held and he was visited
with the punishment of dismissal. It is well settled in law, if an ex parte
enquiry is held behind the back of the delinquent employee and there are
stigmatic remarks that would constitute foundation and not the motive.
Therefore, when the enquiry commenced and thereafter without framing of
charges or without holding an enquiry the delinquent employee was dismissed,
definitely, there is clear violation of principles of natural justice. It
cannot be equated with a situation of dropping of the disciplinary proceedings
and passing an  13 order of termination simpliciter. In that event it would
have been motive and could not have travelled to the realm of the foundation.
We may hasten to add that had the appellant would have been visited with minor
punishment, the matter possibly would have been totally different. That is not
the case. It is also not the case that he was terminated solely on the ground
of earlier punishment. In fact, he continued in service thereafter. As the
report would reflect that there are many an allegation subsequent to the
imposition of punishment relating to his conduct, misbehaviour and
disobedience. The Vigilance Department, in fact, had conducted an enquiry
behind the back of the appellant. The stigma has been cast in view of the
report received by the Central Vigilance Commission which was ex parte and
when that was put to the delinquent employee, holding of a regular enquiry was
imperative. It was not an enquiry only to find out that he did not possess the
requisite qualification. Had that been so, the matter would have been
altogether different. The allegations in the report of the Vigilance
Department pertain to his misbehaviour, conduct and his dealing with the
officers and the same also gets accentuated by the stand taken in the counter
affidavit. Thus, by no stretch of imagination it can be accepted that it is
termination simpliciter. The Division Bench has expressed the view that no
departmental enquiry was required to be held as it was only an enquiry to find
out the necessary qualification for the post of Chest Therapist. Had the
factual score been so, the said analysis would have been treated as correct,
but unfortunately the exposition of factual matrix is absolutely different.
Under such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to concur with the view
expressed by the Division Bench.
10\. By way of referring to this judgment, he further submitted that in
absence of show cause, the impugned orders are not tenable and are fit to be
quashed by this Court. Mr. Sinha, the learned Senior counsel further relied in
case of "Commissioner of Police, Delhi & Ors. v. Jai Bhagwan" reported in
(2011) 6 SCC 376. By way of referring to the said judgment, Mr. Sinha, has
submitted that in  14 absence of any departmental proceeding and without
following that procedure and the principles of natural justice, the impugned
order cannot sustain and accordingly are fit to be quashed. He further relied
in the case of "Mahesh Chandra Verma Vs. State of Jharkhand" reported in 2018
(3) JLJR 5 (SC). By relying on this judgment, he further submitted that the
Court has been pleased to interfere and quashed the impugned order.
11\. The learned counsels appearing in the rest of the cases have adopted the
argument of Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, the learned Senior counsel mutatis mutandis.
12\. The learned counsels appearing in other writ petitions only added the
fact that the vacancies are still there.
13\. Mr. Manoj Kumar, the learned State counsel has submitted that in light of
the order of this Court in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017 dated 11.08.2017, the
medical board was re-constituted. He submitted that in view of paragraph no.14
of the counter affidavit of respondent no.6 the Court has been pleased to
direct to re-
constitute the expert medical board and pursuant thereto the expert medical
board was constituted and thereafter the impugned order has been passed in
terms of the said order. He submitted that the process has already been
completed. Thus, there is no illegality in the impugned order as the
petitioners have not been found medically fit by the re-constituted apex
medical board. He relied in the case of "Madan Lal & Ors. v. State of Jammu &
Kashmir" reported in (1995) 3 SCC 486. Paragraph no.9 of the said judgment is
quoted  15 hereinbelow:
> 9\. Before dealing with this contention, we must keep in view the salient
> fact that the petitioners as well as the contesting successful candidates
> being respondents concerned herein, were all found eligible in the light of
> marks obtained in the written test, to be eligible to be called for oral
> interview. Up to this stage there is no dispute between the parties. The
> petitioners also appeared at the oral interview conducted by the Members
> concerned of the Commission who interviewed the petitioners as well as the
> contesting respondents concerned. Thus the petitioners took a chance to get
> themselves selected at the said oral interview. Only because they did not
> find themselves to have emerged successful as a result of their combined
> performance both at written test and oral interview, they have filed this
> petition. It is now well settled that if a candidate takes a calculated
> chance and appears at the interview, then, only because the result of the
> interview is not palatable to him, he cannot turn round and subsequently
> contend that the process of interview was unfair or the Selection Committee
> was not properly constituted. In the case of Om Prakash Shukla v. Akhilesh
> Kumar Shukla it has been clearly laid down by a Bench of three learned
> Judges of this Court that when the petitioner appeared at the examination
> without protest and when he found that he would not succeed in examination
> he filed a petition challenging the said examination, the High Court should
> not have granted any relief to such a petitioner.
16
14\. He further relied in the case of "K.H. Siraj v. High Court of Kerala &
Ors." reported in (2006) 6 SCC 395. He further relied in the case of "K.A.
Nagamani v. Indian Airlines & Ors." reported in (2009) 5 SCC 515. He further
relied in the case of "State of Jharkhand & Ors. v. Ashok Kumar Dangi & Ors."
reported in (2011) 13 SCC 383. He further relied in the case of "D. Saroja
Kumari v. R.
Helen Thilokam & Ors." reported in (2017) 9 SCC 478. He further relied in the
case of "Ashok Kumar & Anr. v. State of Bihar" & Ors.
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 357. Paragraph nos.12 to 22 of the said judgment are
quoted hereinbelow :
> "12. The appellants participated in the fresh process of selection. If the
> appellants were aggrieved by the decision to hold a fresh process, they did
> not espouse their remedy. Instead, they participated in the fresh process of
> selection and it was only upon being unsuccessful that they challenged the
> result in the writ petition. This was clearly not open to the appellants.
> The principle of estoppel would operate.
> 13\. The law on the subject has been crystallised in several decisions of
> this Court. In Chandra Prakash Tiwari v. Shakuntala Shukla, this Court laid
> down the principle that when a candidate appears at an examination without
> objection and is subsequently found to be not successful, a challenge to the
> process is precluded.
The question of entertaining a petition challenging an examination would not
arise where a candidate has appeared and participated. He or she cannot
subsequently turn around and contend that the process was unfair or that there
was a lacuna  17 therein, merely because the result is not palatable. In Union
of India v. S. Vinodh Kumar, this Court held that: (SCC p. 107, para 18) "18.
It is also well settled that those candidates who had taken part in the
selection process knowing fully well the procedure laid down therein were not
entitled to question the same. (See Munindra Kumar v. Rajiv Govil and Rashmi
Mishra v. M.P. Public Service Commission.)"
14\. The same view was reiterated in Amlan Jyoti Borooah wherein it was held
to be well settled that the candidates who have taken part in a selection
process knowing fully well the procedure laid down therein are not entitled to
question it upon being declared to be unsuccessful.
15\. In Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of Bihar, the same principle was
reiterated in the following observations: (SCC p. 584, para 16) "16. We also
agree with the High Court that after having taken part in the process of
selection knowing fully well that more than 19% marks have been earmarked for
viva voce test, the petitioner is not entitled to challenge the criteria or
process of selection. Surely, if the petitioner's name had appeared in the
merit list, he would not have even dreamed of challenging the selection. The
petitioner invoked jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India only after he found that his name does not figure in the
merit list prepared by the Commission. This conduct of the petitioner clearly
disentitles him from questioning the selection and the High Court did not
commit any error by refusing to entertain the writ petition. Reference in this
connection may  18 be made to the judgments in Madan Lal v. State of J&K,
Marripati Nagaraja v. State of A.P., Dhananjay Malik v. State of Uttaranchal,
Amlan Jyoti Borooah v. State of Assam and K.A.
Nagamani v. Indian Airlines."
16\. In Vijendra Kumar Verma v. Public Service Commission, candidates who had
participated in the selection process were aware that they were required to
possess certain specific qualifications in computer operations. The appellants
had appeared in the selection process and after participating in the interview
sought to challenge the selection process as being without jurisdiction. This
was held to be impermissible.
17\. In Ramesh Chandra Shah v. Anil Joshi, candidates who were competing for
the post of Physiotherapist in the State of Uttarakhand participated in a
written examination held in pursuance of an advertisement. This Court held
that if they had cleared the test, the respondents would not have raised any
objection to the selection process or to the methodology adopted. Having taken
a chance of selection, it was held that the respondents were disentitled to
seek relief under Article 226 and would be deemed to have waived their right
to challenge the advertisement or the procedure of selection. This Court held
that: (SCC p. 318, para 18) "18. It is settled law that a person who
consciously takes part in the process of selection cannot, thereafter, turn
around and question the method of selection and its outcome."
18\. In Chandigarh Admn. v. Jasmine Kaur, it was held that a candidate who
takes a calculated risk or chance by subjecting himself or herself to  19 the
selection process cannot turn around and complain that the process of
selection was unfair after knowing of his or her non-selection. In Pradeep
Kumar Rai v. Dinesh Kumar Pandey, this Court held that: (SCC p. 500, para 17)
"17. Moreover, we would concur with the Division Bench on one more point that
the appellants had participated in the process of interview and not challenged
it till the results were declared. There was a gap of almost four months
between the interview and declaration of result. However, the appellants did
not challenge it at that time. This, it appears that only when the appellants
found themselves to be unsuccessful, they challenged the interview. This
cannot be allowed. The candidates cannot approbate and reprobate at the same
time. Either the candidates should not have participated in the interview and
challenged the procedure or they should have challenged immediately after the
interviews were conducted."
This principle has been reiterated in a recent judgment in Madras Institute of
Development Studies v. K. Sivasubramaniyan.
19\. In the present case, regard must be had to the fact that the appellants
were clearly on notice, when the fresh selection process took place that
written examination would carry ninety marks and the interview, ten marks. The
appellants participated in the selection process. Moreover, two other
considerations weigh in balance. The High Court noted in the impugned judgment
that the interpretation of Rule 6 was not free from vagueness. There was, in
other words, no glaring or patent illegality in the process adopted by the  20
High Court. There was an element of vagueness about whether Rule 6 which dealt
with promotion merely incorporated the requirement of an examination provided
in Rule 5 for direct recruitment to Class III posts or whether the marks and
qualifying marks were also incorporated. Moreover, no prejudice was
established to have been caused to the appellants by the 90 : 10 allocation.
20\. The decision in Raj Kumar v. Shakti Raj (which was relied upon by the
appellants) involved a case where the Government was found to have committed
glaring illegalities in the procedure. Hence, it was held that the principle
of estoppel by conduct or acquiescence had no application. The decision is
distinguishable.
21\. In this view of the matter, the Division Bench cannot held to be in error
in coming to the conclusion that it was not open to the appellants after
participating in the selection process to question the result, once they were
declared to be unsuccessful. During the course of the hearing, this Court is
informed that four out of six candidates, who were ultimately selected,
figured both in the first process of selection as well as in the subsequent
selection. One candidate is stated to have retired.
22\. The apprehension now is of the remaining candidate being reverted as a
result of the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. In our view,
it would be appropriate if the equities are duly adjusted by a suitable
direction. We are of the view that the ends of the justice would be met by a
direction that in the event that there is any existing vacancy, the appellant
who  21 has still continued in service, may be allowed to continue to work on
the Class III post in which he is currently working on a provisional basis
until the next round of selection process takes place. The appellant would be
at liberty to participate in the selection process that may be held in future
and in the event he is declared successful, he would be at liberty to make a
representation to the competent authority for consideration of the period
spent by him on the Class III post for the purpose of fixation of seniority.
15\. Mr. Sanjoy Piprawal, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Jharkhand
Staff Selection Commission [JSSC] has submitted that the apex medical board
was constituted pursuant to the order of this Court supra. The petitioners
participated in the medical board without any protest. The petitioners did not
challenge the order of this Court nor tried to get modified the order by the
Court which has attained the finality. The petitioners have not intervened in
that writ petition inspite of knowing the fact that they were called for
medical board pursuant to the order of this Court. The further recommendation
has already been made by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission in view of
reconstituted medical board.
16\. On the premise of the above arguments of the learned counsel appearing
for the parties, the Court proceeded to examine the grounds taken by the
petitioners as well as the respondent-State and the Jharkhand Staff Selection
Commission. It is an admitted fact that the petitioners in all these cases
were selected and they have been appointed on the post of constable. Pursuant
to the order of  22 this Court dated 11.08.2017 passed in W.P.(S) No.3239 of
2017 the apex medical board was constituted. The petitioners appeared before
the apex medical board without any protest. The petitioners have not
challenged the order dated 11.08.2017 passed in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017 which
has attained finality. The petitioners have not tried to get themselves
impleaded in W.P.(S) No.3239 of 2017. In one of the writ petition further
medical examination of some of the petitioners examined by some other doctors
of RIMS have been enclosed. The Court is not in a position to accept that
document as valid examination that in view of the fact that this has been suo-
muto on the part of some of the petitioners in one of the writ petition. The
Court is not an expert of medical examination which is in the domain of
medical board. The apex medical board is constituted by highly qualified
persons of CRPF and in that view of the matter the Court is not in a position
to doubt the same. The illegality has been admitted by the respondent State of
Jharkhand as indicated in order dated 11.08.2017.
17\. In the light of these findings, the question remains as to whether in
absence of any departmental proceeding and without any show cause the
dismissal of the petitioners is justified or not. Had it been a case that the
petitioners were objected to the further board pursuant to order of this Court
which has not been challenged and tried to be got impleaded in W.P.(S) No.3239
of 2017, the matter would have been different but on all these aspects the
petitioners failed to do so. There may be situations where in for the some  23
reasons perhaps because the evidence against the individual is thought to be
utterly compelling and it is felt that fair hearing would not change the
ultimate conclusion reached by the decision maker.
In this aspect the reference be made to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in "Dharampal Satpal Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner, Central Excise, Gauhati &
Ors." reported in (2015) 8 SCC 519.
Paragraph nos. 30 and 39 of the said judgment are quoted hereinbelow:
> "30. Wade also emphasises that principles of natural justice operate as
> implied mandatory requirements, non- observance of which invalidates the
> exercise of power.
> 39\. We are not concerned with these aspects in the present case as the
> issue relates to giving of notice before taking action. While emphasising
> that the principles of natural justice cannot be applied in straitjacket
> formula, the aforesaid instances are given. We have highlighted the
> jurisprudential basis of adhering to the principles of natural justice which
> are grounded on the doctrine of procedural fairness, accuracy of outcome
> leading to general social goals, etc. Nevertheless, there may be situations
> wherein for some reason--perhaps because the evidence against the individual
> is thought to be utterly compelling--it is felt that a fair hearing "would
> make no difference"--meaning that a hearing would not change the ultimate
> conclusion reached by the decision-maker--then no legal duty to supply a
> hearing arises. Such an approach was endorsed by Lord Wilberforce in Malloch
> v. Aberdeen Corpn., who said that: (WLR p. 1595 : All ER p. 1294) "... A
> breach of procedure ... cannot give [rise to] a remedy in the courts, unless
> behind it there is something of substance which has been lost by the
> failure. The court does not act in vain."
> Relying on these comments, Brandon L.J. opined in  24 Cinnamond v. British
> Airports Authority that: (WLR p. 593 : All ER p. 377) "... no one can
> complain of not being given an opportunity to make representations if such
> an opportunity would have availed him nothing."
> In such situations, fair procedures appear to serve no purpose since the
> "right" result can be secured without according such treatment to the
> individual."
18\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case of "Escorts Farms Ltd. v. Commr.,
Kumaon Division,, Nainital, U.P." reported in (2004) 4 SCC 281. Paragraph
no.64 of the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow:
> 64\. Right of hearing to a necessary party is a valuable right. Denial of
> such right is serious breach of statutory procedure prescribed and violation
> of rules of natural justice. In these appeals preferred by the holder of
> lands and some other transferees, we have found that the terms of government
> grant did not permit transfers of land without permission of the State as
> grantor. Remand of cases of a group of transferees who were not heard,
> would, therefore, be of no legal consequence, more so, when on this legal
> question all affected parties have got full opportunity of hearing before
> the High Court and in this appeal before this Court. Rules of natural
> justice are to be followed for doing substantial justice and not for
> completing a mere ritual of hearing without possibility of any change in the
> decision of the case on merits. In view of the legal position explained by
> us above, we, therefore, refrain from remanding these cases in exercise of
> our discretionary powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India."
19\. Question of prejudice if the enquiry is conducted what prejudice is
caused to the petitioners since there is no other chance of other outcome in a
proceeding the chance of prejudice is not in  25 favour of the petitioners in
these writ petitions.
20\. In the light of the above discussions and considering the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of "Escorts Farms Ltd. vs. Commr. Kumaon
Division, Nainital, U.P." supra even assuming that for following the
principles of natural justice the matter is remanded back to the authorities
concerned, it will be a futile exercise in the facts and circumstances of the
case as the entire exercise has been made pursuant to the order of this Court
dated 11.08.2017 which has not been challenged and has attained finality and
thereafter only the impugned orders of dismissal have been passed.
21\. The judgment relied by Mr. Anil Kumar Sinha, the learned Senior counsel
in the case of "Ratnesh Kumar Choudhary" supra the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
examining the non-supply of certain documents in the enquiry proceeding and
considering the principles of natural justice the fact of this case is
different from the case in hand as the petitioners have failed to raise
objection at the appropriate time. The judgment relied by Mr. Sinha in the
facts of "Commissioner of Police, Delhi & Ors." supra is also of no help in
the present facts and circumstances of this case as in that case, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court was examining the proceeding in the departmental proceeding on
the alleged mis-conduct of taking gratification of Rs.100/- from the
complainant. In the present case the petitioners have accepted the order of
this Court dated 11.08.2017 as discussed hereinabove. Thus, this judgment is
also not  26 helping the petitioners. The judgment relied by the petitioners
in case of "State of Jharkhand & Ors. v. Ashok Kumar Dangi & Ors." supra is
also different. The parameters in that case is that at the fag end of service
the dispute arises in that view of the matter the Court passed the order. The
fact of this case is also different and not helping the petitioners. The
judgments relied by the learned counsel for the respondent State are not
relevant in the facts and circumstances of this case, except in the case of
"Ashok Kumar & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Ors." supra. It appears from this case
that the other cases relied by the learned counsel for the respondent State
are different. It is well settled proposition of law that once a person
participated in the proceeding, they are not allowed to challenge the same.
The facts of this case from the present case are different. Thus, the cases
relied by the Mr. Kumar, the learned State counsel except in the case of Ashok
Kumar & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Ors." supra are not applicable. The
petitioners participated in the fresh process in terms of the order of the
Court. If they were aggrieved by the decision to hold a fresh medical
examination they were bound to explore the remedy in the law instead they
participated in the fresh process of selection and upon being unsuccessful and
dismissal they challenged in these writ petitions. This was clearly not open
to the petitioners.
The principles of estoppel would operate. The case relied by the learned
counsel for the respondent State is applicable in the facts and circumstances
of the case of Ashok Kumar & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Ors." supra. Moreover,
the Medical Board reports are not under  27 challenge in these writ petitions.
The JSSC has already issued the appointment letters in view of further medical
board report. The illegality has been admitted by the State as indicated in
order dated 11.08.2017.
22\. As a cumulative effect of above discussions and findings, the Court comes
to a definite conclusion that no relief can be extended to the petitioners in
these writ petitions.
23\. Accordingly, these writ petitions being W.P.(S) No.4489 of 2018, W.P.(S)
No. 1905 of 2019, W.P.(S) No. 4351 of 2018, W.P.(S) No.4609 of 2018, W.P.(S)
No.6359 of 2018 and W.P.(S) No.5001 of 2018 are dismissed.
24\. I.A., if any, also stand disposed of.
