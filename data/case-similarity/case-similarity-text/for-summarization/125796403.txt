the Bright Line Test and by taking the view that the taxpayer had incurred
huge AMP/sales expenses to the tune of 18.14%, no cogent material is there to
treat the incurring of AMP expenses as international transaction more
particularly when basis for treating the AMP expenses as international
transactions i.e. BLT is not sustainable method. So, following the binding
judicial precedents, impugned ALP adjustment on account of AMP expenses is
ordered to be deleted. Consequently, appeal filed by the taxpayer is allowed.

                            ORDER
PER KULDIP SINGH, JUDICIAL MEMBER :
The Appellant, M/s. Moet Hennessy India Private Ltd. (hereinafter referred to
as 'the taxpayer') by filing the present appeal sought to set aside the
impugned order dated 13.11.2014 passed by the AO in consonance with the orders
passed by the ld. DRP/TPO under section 143 (3) read with section 144C of the
2 ITA No.85/Del/2015 Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short 'the Act') qua the
assessment year 2010-11 on the grounds inter alia that :-
> "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax - Circle 5(1) ('AO')/ Transfer Pricing
> Officer (TPO')/ Dispute Resolution Panel ('DRP') erred in confirming the
> adjustment of Rs.7,12,19,145 by holding that the Appellant ought to have
> received reimbursement for "alleged excessive" Advertising, Marketing and
> Promotion ('AMP') expenses from its Associated Enterprises. ('AEs').
> 2\. On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the AO / TPO/ DRP
> erred in:
> a) disregarding the fact that the premium profits earned by the Appellant
> compensated for the allegedly excessive AMP expenses, if any, incurred by
> it;
> b) disregarding the transfer pricing policy of the Moet Group wherein Moet
> India is provided with an agreed contribution margin which clearly indicates
> that Moet Group funds the AMP expenses of Moet India;
> c) misinterpreting or placing incorrect reliance on the international
> guidance in relation to the 'marketing intangibles' from Organisation for
> Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), US TP Regulations and
> Australian Tax Office ('ATO') and relying on several erroneous/ factually
> incorrect and contradictory statements/ observations in the Transfer Pricing
> (TP') order, which are not relevant to the instant case, only in order to
> justify an otherwise inappropriate and unwarranted TP adjustment;
> d) incorrectly holding the AMP expenses incurred by the Appellant to be
> "excessive" on the basis of a "bright line limit" arrived at by deriving a
> distorted and incorrect set of comparable companies;
> e) by holding that a mark-up of 15% ought to be earned by the Appellant in
> respect of the "alleged excessive" AMP expenses, without any basis;
> f) in following the decision of the Hon'ble Special Bench in the case of LG
> Electronics (152 TTJ 273) (Del) (5B) without appreciating the fact that the
> said decision was rendered in the context of licensed manufacturer and hence
> not applicable to the distributor.
3 ITA No.85/Del/2015
> The Appellant therefore prays that the aforesaid adjustment be deleted.
> 3\. Without prejudice to the above, on the facts and in the circumstances of
> the case and in law, the AO / TPO/ DRP erred in considering expenses such as
> discounts, rebates, commission, trade component cost, trade incentives, etc.
> for computing the AMP spend ratio of the Appellant."
2\. Briefly stated the facts necessary for adjudication of the controversy at
hand are : Moet India, the taxpayer held 99% by Champagne Moet & Chandon,
France ('CMC') and 1% by Jas Hannessy & Co., France ('JHC'). CMC is one of the
leading producers of Champagne, which is a sparkling wine manufactured in the
Champagne region of France. JHC is a leading producer of Cognac (spirits).
3\. The taxpayer is into the business of importing and distributing different
kinds of wines and spirits and executing (ex-bonded) warehouse sales in India.
The taxpayer undertakes marketing and sales promotion of products in its
trading portfolio and is assisted by its Associated Enterprises (AE) in
carrying out this function. The taxpayer imports advertising and promotional
material from its AE such as wine glasses, menu holders etc. to be given as
complimentary products to its customers.
4\. During the year under assessment, the taxpayer entered into international
transactions with its AE as under :-
                                         4                    ITA No.85/Del/2015

4\. Ld. TPO has accepted all the aforesaid international transactions at arm's
length, however disputed the Advertisement, Marking and Promotional (AMP)
expenses by noticing that the taxpayer has incurred huge AMP expenditure and
beneficiary of the efforts of the taxpayer is its AE because of the increase
in the brand value significantly. TPO also taken the view that the taxpayer
has created marketing intangibles in favour of the taxpayer.
5\. Declining the contentions raised by the taxpayer that any benefit that AE
may have drawn is incidental in nature as the brand taxpayer has received from
its AE has no intrinsic value, TPO after using "Bright Line Method" selected 5
comparables with average of AMP/Sales at 4.678% as against average of taxpayer
at 13.34% and has also added mark-up of 15% on AMP spent and calculated the
AMP expenses as under :-
5 ITA No.85/Del/2015
          Arm's length margin for markup :          15%
           Total revenue of the assessee                   499,154,634
           Arm's length price of AMP expenses (%)              0.935%
           Arm's length AMP expenses (A)                     46,67,096
           AMP expenses incurred by the assessee (B)        66,596,787
Expenditure incurred on creation of intangibles 6,19,29,691 (B) - (A) Mark up
@ 15% 92,89,454 Arm's length value of AMP expenses 71,219,145
6\. The taxpayer carried the matter before the ld. DRP by way of filing
objections, who has confirmed the arm's length value of AMP expenses at
Rs.712,19,145/- proposed by the TPO. Feeling aggrieved, the taxpayer has come
up before the Tribunal by way of filing the present appeal.
7\. We have heard the ld. Authorized Representatives of the parties to the
appeal, gone through the documents relied upon and orders passed by the
revenue authorities below in the light of the facts and circumstances of the
case.
8\. Undisputedly, assessee is a distributor exposed to routine risks
associated with carrying out the business of distribution of wine and spirits.
It is also not in dispute that the ld. TPO has recognised the taxpayer as a
distributor. It is also not in dispute that the taxpayer is not the owner of
the brand. It is also not in dispute that the TPO has followed LG Electronics
India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT (2013) 29 taxmann.com 300 (Delhi)(SB) and used the  6
ITA No.85/Del/2015 "Bright Line Test" to determine the arm's length value of
AMP expenses.
9\. The ld. TPO noticed that the AMP expenditure of the taxpayer is 13.34% of
sales as against 0.935% of sale for the comparable, thus incurred huge
expenses of Rs.66,596,787/- on the sale of Rs.499,154,634/-. Following the LG
Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the ld. TPO applied 'cost plus method'
for determining the ALP of international transaction of brand building for its
AE.
10\. We are of the considered view that firstly LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) decided by the Special Bench of the Tribunal applying the "Bright Line
Test" in order to decide the issue if AMP expenditure by the taxpayer is
international transaction leading to the brand building of its AE has since
been overruled by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Sony Ericsson India Pvt.
Ltd. v. CIT (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del.) and subsequently in Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd. v. CIT (2016) 328 ITR 210 (Del.) has categorically held that BLT is not a
valid basis for determining the existence of international transaction or for
that matter for computing the ALP of such international transaction involving
AMP expenses, the order of TPO passed by making BLT as basis of the ALP
adjustment is not sustainable in the eyes of law.  7 ITA No.85/Del/2015
11\. Ld. AR for the taxpayer brought to our notice that the issue in
controversy in the present appeal is a covered one in taxpayer's own case for
AY 2009-10 decided in ITA No.1906/Del/2014 decided by order dated 23.08.2018,
which fact has not been controverted by the dl. DR for the Revenue.
12\. Ld. TPO in order to arrive at the decision that AMP expenditure incurred
by the taxpayer is an international transaction for which reimbursement should
have been received by the taxpayer by making following observations :-
> "2. It is seen from audited financial of the assessee company that a sum of
> Rs.6,18,37,549/- has been incurred by it on advertisement and sales
> promotion (AMP) which amounts to 26.94% of the total sales of the assessee
> company. It is proposed that the AMP expenditure incurred by the assessee
> should be considered as an international transaction for which reimbursement
> should have been received by the assessee as it leads to creation of
> marketing intangible for the AEs and not for the business purposes of the
> assessee.
> 2.1 It has been mentioned Para 4.3.3 of the transfer pricing report that
> "MHIPL does not own any significant intangible and does not undertake any
> significant Research and Development on its account that leads to the
> development of nonroutine intangibles. MHIPL uses the trademark, know-how,
> technical data software, quality standard etc., developed/owned by CMC. All
> companies of the group leverage from these intangibles for continued growth
> in revenues and profits. Accordingly, MHIPL does not own any significant
> non-routine intangibles."
2.2 From the quantum of the advertisement and sales promotion expense incurred
by the assessee it is apparent that the assessee is involved in the promotion
of a Brand which is not owned by it. It is doing it for the benefit of the
Brand Owner i.e. the foreign AE CMC, France, hence, it should have been paid
for the services being provided by it. However, no agreement between the
assessee and the AE for the promotion of the brand has been filed. The
transfer pricing regulations require that it is  8 ITA No.85/Del/2015 not the
'form' but the overall arrangement/substance of the transactions that must be
kept in mind.
Section 92F(v) of the Income-tax Act states: "transaction includes an
arrangement, understanding or action in concert, whether or not such
arrangement, understanding or action is formal or in writing;" Similarly, Rule
10B(2)(c) states:
"the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing) of
the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the
responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions;"
2.3 Above provisions read with the well established doctrine of 'substance
over form' (applied by the Courts in numerous judicial decisions) indicate
that transfer pricing regulations are to be applied keeping in mind the
overall scheme of the taxpayer's business arrangement.
2.4 In view of the discussions in the foregoing paragraphs I am of the
considered view that the expenditure incurred on AMP by the assessee and
thereby promoting the brand/trade name owned by CMC, France, the AE is an
international transaction and the same has neither been reported in Form 3CEB
nor has been benchmarked in transfer pricing study, I am of the considered
view that the onus which was on the assessee to benchmark the international
transaction relating to the expenditure incurred on AMP has not been
discharged. I therefore propose to benchmark the transactions relating to
"AMP".
2.5 It has already been stated in the foregoing paragraphs that the
expenditure on AMP has been incurred to promote the brand/trade name owned by
CMC, France, the AE and such expenditure has resulted into brand building and
increased awareness of the products bearing such brands/trade names. I am of
the considered view that the expenditure incurred by the assessee company is
for the advantage of its AE, since the brand/trade name is owned by the AE. In
such a situation the assessee company should have been suitably compensated by
the AE. However the assessee has not received any payment in this regard from
the AE. Therefore it is clear that the assessee has not been suitably
compensated by the AE in respect of the expenditure incurred by it (the
assessee) on Advertising and Sales Promotion expenses (AMP) to penetrate the
market and to increase the sales by promoting the brand name."  9 ITA
No.85/Del/2015
13\. From the aforesaid observations of the ld. TPO, we have gathered that the
TPO has treated the AMP expenditure as international transactions merely on
the ground that the taxpayer has incurred huge expenses on AMP spent and has
made comparison with (i) IFB Agro Inds. Ltd.; (ii) Rajasthan State Ganganagar
Sugar Mills Ltd.; (iii J.L. Morison (I) Ltd.; and (iv) Lotus Herbals Ltd.
having AMP expenses/sales of 1.32%, 0.55%, 7.32% & 9.50% respectively as
against taxpayer's AMP expenditure of 18.14% of the total sales. We are of the
considered view that highest AMP expenses per se cannot be a ground to infer
that there was an international transaction.
14\. The taxpayer has given details of expenses in the nature of AMP expenses,
available at page 205 of the paper book, which are as under :-
          Sr.No.                 Nature of expenses               Amount
          1        Advertising exp                                   130,125

          4        Display charges at events                          96,137
          5        Employee Claim for A&P Expenses                    66,267
          6        Event Organiser                                    49,635
          7        Event/Sponsorship Expenses                      4,905,212
          8        Incentive                                       2,680,690

                   Total                                          17,255,570
                                      10                   ITA No.85/Del/2015
15\. The taxpayer also brought on record the fact that the AMP expenses
considered by the TPO i.e. Rs.90.551.831/- include distribution expenses of
Rs.23,955,044/- which are also required to be excluded by computing the
AMP/sales ratio of the taxpayer. It is also the case of the taxpayer that it
has incurred Rs.66,596,787/- towards AMP expenses merely for creating
awareness of the product and not for its brand building.
16\. From the order passed by the ld. TPO/DRP/AO, it is undisputedly proved on
fact that the facts in the case at hand are identical to taxpayer's own case
for AY 2009-10 decided by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal and has not
undergone any change in its business model. Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal
in taxpayer's own case decided the issue in controversy in favour of the
taxpayer by deleting the ALP adjustment on account of AMP expenses by
returning following findings :-
> "9. On a careful consideration of all these factors, including the
> inconsistency in the approach of the AO/TPO with respect to the AMP
> expenditure being in the nature of an international transaction as
> expenditure incurred on behalf of the assessee, including the quantum and
> nature of expenditure and including lack of any material to suggest that
> there was "an arrangement, understanding or action in concert" with respect
> of the expenditure incurred by the assessee and including the fact that, in
> our considered view, the expenditure incurred by the assessee was in nature
> of bonafide business expenditure in furtherance of its legitimate business
> interests, we are of the considered view  11 ITA No.85/Del/2015 that there
> is no legally sustainable basis for the TPO coming to the conclusion that
> there was an international transaction, under section 92B, on the facts of
> this case. It was only on the basis of bright line test that the impugned
> ALP adjustment was made but that approach has already been negatived by
> Hon'ble Courts above. We see no reasons to remit the matter to the file of

> remand to the assessment stage cannot be a matter of routine; it has to be
> so done only when there is anything in the facts and circumstances to so
> warrant or justify. In any case, there are direct judicial precedents from
> Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court which clearly suggest that the matter
> regarding existence of international transaction under section 92B, as far
> as possible, should be decided at the level of Tribunal itself. In the case
> of Bacardi India (supra), Their Lordships, inter alia, have observed as
> follows:
> 5\. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, the Court finds that the
> case before the ITAT was argued at length and the views of the TPO as well
> as the Dispute Resolution Panel ('DRP') were already available to the ITAT.
> Arguments were advanced on the strength of judgments of this Court in Sony
> Ericsson Mobile Communications India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income
> Tax (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del.) as well as a string of subsequent judgments
> beginning with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd v. CIT, (2016) 381 ITR 117.
> 6\. Nevertheless, the main reason that weighed with the ITAT to remand the
> matter to the TPO was that the TPO did not have the benefit of the above
> decisions of this Court when the order was initially passed by the TPO. That
> can hardly be a ground for remanding the entire matter to the TPO. In fact,
> this was anticipated by this Court in Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
> India Pvt. Ltd.(supra). In para 193 of that judgment, it cautioned that the
> ITAT should not simply remand the matter to the TPO but examine it itself,
> particularly when the facts have already been analysed and considered and no
> new facts have emerged in the meanwhile.
> 7\. In the present case, all the facts necessary for the ITAT to form an
> opinion on the issues before it  12 ITA No.85/Del/2015 concerning the AMP
> expenditure were already before it. In the circumstances, the remand to the
> TPO of the entire matter for a decision afresh appears to be unwarranted.
> The assessee thus succeeds in this appeal.
> 10\. In the present case, no new facts have emerged and all the facts
> brought to record, during the course of the assessment proceedings, donot
> indicate legally sustainable basis for coming to the conclusion that there
> was an internal transaction in respect of AMP expenses incurred by the
> assessee. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the plea of the
> assessee, on the peculiar facts of this case, does indeed deserve to be
> upheld that there is no material on record to hold that there was an
> international transactions, in terms of the provisions of Section 92B, nor
> any material has been brought on record to even remotely suggest so and,
> therefore, that there is no good reason to remit the matter to the

> made solely on the basis of bright line test. The plea of the learned
> counsel was indeed well taken and merits acceptance. The impugned ALP
> adjustment of Rs.6,64,70,841, accordingly, stands deleted."
> 17\. Following the decision rendered by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal
> in taxpayer's own case for AY 2009-10 and in view of the decision rendered
> by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Sony Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd. and Maruti
> Suzuki India Ltd. v. CIT (supra), the Revenue has failed to discharge the
> onus to prove the international transactions between the taxpayer and its AE
> and only thereafter ALP of international transactions involving AMP expenses
> can be computed.
13 ITA No.85/Del/2015
18\. In the instant case, there is not an iota of material apart from applying
the Bright Line Test and by taking the view that the taxpayer had incurred
huge AMP/sales expenses to the tune of 18.14%, no cogent material is there to
treat the incurring of AMP expenses as international transaction more
particularly when basis for treating the AMP expenses as international
transactions i.e. BLT is not sustainable method. So, following the binding
judicial precedents, impugned ALP adjustment on account of AMP expenses is
ordered to be deleted. Consequently, appeal filed by the taxpayer is allowed.
