thereby erred in not appreciating that the Appellant had prepared the TP
documentation is bona fide and in good faith.
3\. The learned AO and the learned DRP erred in law and on facts in

4\. The learned AO and the learned DRP erred in law and on facts in upholding
the use of data which was not contemporaneous and which was not available in

the acts of the learned TPO:
(a)in rejecting the comparability analysis of the Appellant in the TP

transfer pricing order, which is based on inappropriate filters and
application of inconsistent comparability criteria.

and substituting the Appellant's analysis with fresh benchmarking analysis
based on his own conjectures/ assumptions and application of new filters.
6\. That the learned AO and the learned DRP erred in law and on facts in
upholding the actions of the TPO in the use of information under section

documentation for the referred financial year.

IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 6 of 20
3\. At the time of hearing of this appeal, it was submitted by ld. AR of
assessee that only ground nos. 9,10,14,15,16 and 21 are to be decided and the
remaining grounds are not pressed and accordingly the remaining grounds are
rejected as not pressed.
4\. It was submitted by ld. AR of assessee that there are two segments in the
present case i.e. 1) Software development services and 2) ITES. He submitted
that for the first segment i.e. software development services segment, the
assessee selected 7 comparables having arithmetic mean of 13.78% and the TPO
also selected 7 comparables but only two comparables are common i.e. RS
Software (India) Ltd. and Mindtree Ltd. He further submitted that the average
arithmetic mean of these 7 comparables selected by the TPO was worked out at
20.90% and accordingly, the TPO made TP adjustment of Rs. 30,00,49,230/-. When
the assessee carried the matter in appeal before the DRP, the DRP selected 6
comparables after excluding one comparable i.e. Tech Mahindra Ltd. (seg). He
submitted that as per ground no. 9 of the assessee's appeal, Larsen & Toubro
Infotech Ltd. should be excluded from the list of final comparables in respect
of software development services segment and as per ground no. 10 of the
assessee's appeal, another comparable i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd. should be
excluded from the list of final comparables. Regarding the assessee's request
for exclusion of Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. i.e. ground no. 9 of the
assessee's appeal, he submitted that this issue is covered in favour of the
assessee by the Tribunal order rendered in the case of Pitney Bowes Software
India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT for the same Assessment Year as reported in
[TS-163-ITAT-2018(Del)-TP] and the relevant paras of this Tribunal order are
paras 6 to 11 available on pages 1508 to 1512 of the case law compilation
filed by the assessee. Regarding the assessee's request for exclusion of
Persistent Systems Ltd., it was submitted that as per the Tribunal order in
assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2012-13 in IT(TP)A No. 183/Bang/2017
copy available on pages 1477 to 1479 of case law compilation, being paras 27
to 30 of this Tribunal order, it was held by Tribunal that this comparable
should be excluded from the final list of comparables. It was submitted that
there is no IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 7 of 20 difference in facts in
present year and therefore, in present year also, this comparable should be
excluded from the final list of comparables.
5\. In respect of ITES segment, it was submitted by ld. AR of assessee that
the assessee company selected 9 comparables with arithmetic mean margin of
13.52% and the TPO also selected 9 comparables but only two comparables were
common i.e. Infosys BPO Ltd. and Jindal Intellicom Ltd. and as per the TPO's
working, mark-up of total cost after adjustment was worked out at 22.27% and
the TPO made adjustment of Rs. 4,76,15,547/-. Thereafter, he submitted that
when the assessee carried the matter in appeal before the DRP, the DRP
selected 7 comparables after excluding two comparables i.e. Acropetal
Technologies Ltd. and Tech Mahindra Ltd. (seg.). Now the assessee is
requesting for exclusion of Capgemini Business Services (India) Ltd. as per
ground no. 14 and exclusion of Infosys BPO Ltd. as per ground no. 15 and
exclusion of Hartron Communications Ltd. as per ground no. 16. In respect of
these three exclusions, the arguments of the ld. AR of assessee are contained
in para no. D(i) to (iii) of synopsis of arguments and the same are reproduced
hereinbelow.
> "D. APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS ON THE ITS APPEAL:
> (i) Ground No.14:
> In this ground, the Assessee is seeking the exclusion of Capgemini Business
> Services (India) Ltd. ('Capgemini' for short) from the final list of
> comparables to the Appellant's ITE service segment as it fails the RPT
> filter applied by the TPO.
> In this regard, it is submitted that Capgemini has substantial RPT amounting
> to 82.32% of its total sales for the financial year 2012-
> 13\. The Appellant submits that although its RPT details are not disclosed
> in its annual report for FY 2012-13, the same are disclosed in its annual
> report for FY 2013-14. When this fact was brought to the notice of the DRP
> during the course of the proceedings before it, the DRP was of the view that
> this was new information based on data that was not available earlier and,
> accordingly, directed the TPO to cross-verify this information with
> Capgemini and to exclude it as a comparable if the Appellant's claim was
> found to be correct.
> However, despite the above direction, the TPO merely retained the said
> company in the list of comparables despite the fact its RPT is well in
> excess of the threshold at which the RPT filter has been applied by him.
IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 8 of 20 The Appellant submits that from a
perusal of Capgemini's related party transactions, as disclosed by it in its
annual report for FY 2013-14, it is wholly apparent that the ratio of its RPT
to sales for FY 2012-13 is 82.32%. The relevant workings are given at page 147
of the appeal set.
Therefore, as it fails the RPT filter applied by the TPO, Capgemini is liable
to be excluded from the list of comparables.
(ii) Ground No.15:
In this ground, the Assessee is seeking the exclusion of Infosys BPO Ltd.
(`Infosys' for short) from the list of comparables.
Infosys ought to stand excluded from the final list of comparables on numerous
counts. It is engaged in the provision of integrated IT and business process
outsourcing solutions across a variety of verticals including Banking and
Capital Markets, Communication Media and Entertainment, Manufacturing,
Emerging Market Solutions, Insurance and Healthcare, Retail, Energy, Utilities
and Resources, Automotive and Aerospace, Transportation and Services. The
services rendered consist of Sourcing and procurement, customer service,
financing and accounting, knowledge services and human resources. Further, the
company is engaged in providing consultancy, management and strategic
transformation services wherein business metrics and benchmarks developed by
the company is used in assisting the client. The company is also engaged in
the provision of cloud based services such as 'E-Discover' as well as services
in relation to compliance in Health, Safety and Environment. These services
cannot be compared to the routine back office services provided by the
Appellant. The company focuses of delivering solutions to its clients which
goes beyond rendering routine ITE services. From the above, it is evident that
Infosys is engaged in rendering business solutions and consultancy to its
customers which is different from the functional profile of the Appellant.
In addition, Infosys also enjoys significant brand value and owns several
intellectual properties which place it in different from that Appellant. In
view of its substantial brand value, the company enjoys an advantage in the
market and has high bargaining power. As a result of the brand value, the
company receives a premium in the market. Relevant submissions in this regard
are made at pages 148-150 of the appeal set.
The DRP, however, failed to properly appreciate the Appellant's submissions
and accordingly rejected its submissions in this regard. While doing so, the
DRP nevertheless directed the TPO to verify if it fails the export revenue
filter. However, despite the above direction, the company was retained in the
list of comparables.
IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 9 of 20 In support of its contentions for
exclusion of Infosys BPO, reliance is placed on the common order dated
11.04.2018 of this Hon'ble Tribunal in the Assessee's own case for AYs 2010-11
and 2012-13 wherein this Hon'ble Tribunal held that Infosys BPO is not
functionally comparable to the Assessee and, accordingly, directed its
exclusion (pages 1471 to 1473 and 1484 - 1485 of the case-laws compilation --
Vol-II). Since there is no change in the functions of the company during the
assessment year in question, Infosys BPO is liable to be rejected as a
comparable for this AY as well.
Further, this company has been consistently rejected in cases of assessees
placed similarly to that of the Appellant. Reliance is placed on the decision
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in PCIT v. H & S Software Development and
Knowledge Management Centre Pvt Ltd [judgment dated 03.01.2018 in ITA 912/2017
at page 1520 of the case-laws compilation - Vol-II] where its exclusion was
upheld on the basis that the company has significant brand presence and large
corporate size, Reliance is also placed on the decisions of this Hon'ble
Tribunal in e4e Business Solutions India (P.) Ltd. v. /TO ([2017] 87
taxmann.com 254 (Bangalore-Trib.) at para 10.3.1 to 10.3.2) for assessment
year 2012-13 and e4e Business Solutions India P. Ltd. v. DCIT (order dated
13.01.2017 passed in IT(TP)A No. 1397/Bang/2016 at para 11) for the assessment
year 2011-12.
In view of the above, Infosys ought to be excluded from the final list of
comparables.
(iii) Ground No.16:
In this ground, the Assessee is seeking the exclusion of Hartron
Communications Ltd. ("Hartron") from the list of comparables. In this regard,
it is submitted that Hartron, which was chosen by the TPO, has wide
fluctuations in profit which suggest peculiar economic circumstance for which
no appropriate adjustment could be made to mitigate the impact on the margin.
The company has suffered losses during the preceding two financial years and
its margins for Financial Years 2010-11 to 2012-13 vary between (40.53%) to
33.43%. While the company registered profits during the year under
consideration, it has consistently registered losses of -40.53% for the FY
2010-11, -27.09% for the FY 2011-12, - 2.46% for the FY 2013-14 and 20.65 for
the FY 2014-15. Considering the wide fluctuations in the margins, it is
submitted that the said company ought to stand excluded from the list of
comparable companies. Further, as per the annual report of the Company, the
policy followed by it for recognition of revenue/expenditure is as under:
> "All revenues and expenses are accounted for on accrual IT(TP)A No.
> 2460/Bang/2017  Page 10 of 20 basis except for processing charges (export
> income), interest on calls in arrears, listing fee and leave encashment
> which are accounted for on cash basis."
> The above note suggests that cash basis of accounting is followed for export
> income (office back-up operations segment) as against accrual system of
> accounting followed for recording expenses, which is contrary to the
> matching principles of accounting. Further, Hartron is also liable to be
> excluded as the services provided in the segment selected by the TPO for the
> purposes of comparability are dissimilar to the routine ITE services
> provided by the Appellant to its AEs, and thus ought to stand excluded on
> this ground as well. Relevant submissions in this regard are made at pages
> 150-154 of the appeal set.
> The DRP, however, failed to properly appreciate the Appellant's submissions
> and accordingly rejected its submissions in this regard.
> In view of the above, the company ought to be excluded from the final list
> of comparables."
6\. As against this, the ld. DR of revenue supported the orders of authorities
below. She also submitted that in respect of exclusion of Persistent Systems
Ltd., there are various Tribunal orders i.e. Tribunal order rendered in the
case of Microsoft Research Lab India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.
1276/Bang/2017 dated 03.11.2017, WM Global Technology Services (India) P. Ltd.
Vs. ACIT in IT(TP)A No. 1963/Bang/2017 dated 28.02.2018, in the case of Pitney
Bowes Software India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT (supra), copy available in case law
compilation filed by assessee in Vol-II and also in the case of Advice America
Software Development Center (P.) Ltd. Vs. ITO as reported in [2018] 94
taxmann.com 179 (Bangalore-Trib.) copy made available and in the case of
Tecnotree Convergence Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No. 1616/Bang/2017. She
submitted that in the case of Advice America Software Development Center (P.)
Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra), the issue was decided against the assessee and in favour
of the revenue as per para 21 of this Tribunal order whereas in the case of
Pitney Bowes Software India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT (supra), the assessee in that
case did not seek exclusion of Persistent Systems Ltd. and in the remaining
three Tribunal orders, the matter was remanded back to the TPO for fresh
decision. She submitted that in the facts of present case, the Tribunal order
rendered in the case of Advice America Software Development Center (P.) Ltd.
vs. ITO IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 11 of 20 (supra) should be followed
and the issue should be decided against the assessee and in favour of the
revenue.
7\. In the rejoinder, the ld. AR of assessee submitted a comparative chart
pointing out as to in each of these several Tribunal orders, what is the
decision of Tribunal and it was pointed out that as per page no. 861 of the
Annual Report of Persistent Systems Ltd., that company has disclosed that it
earns revenue from royalty and it collects service tax and value added taxes
(VAT) which is leviable only on sale of goods but these facts were not brought
to the notice of the Tribunal in the case of Advice America Software
Development Center (P.) Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra) and therefore, this aspect was
not considered by the Tribunal in that case and hence, this Tribunal order
should not be followed and as per the remaining three Tribunal orders, the
matter is restored back to the file of TPO for fresh decision. Regarding
ground no. 21 which is in respect of corporate tax issue, it was submitted by
ld. AR of assessee that this issue is covered in favour of the assessee by the
judgement of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court rendered in the case ofCIT vs. Tata
Elxsi Ltd., 349 ITR 98. He also submitted that this judgement of Hon'ble
Karnataka High Court has been confirmed by Hon'ble Apex Court also as per its
recent judgement dated 24.04.2018 in CIT vs. HCL Technologies in Civil Appeal
Nos. 8489-8490/2013.
8\. We have considered the rival submissions. First of all, we decide ground
nos. 9 and 10 of the appeal of the assessee. Regarding the assessee's request
for exclusion of Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. for software development
services segment, it is the submission of the learned AR of the assessee that
this issue is covered in favour of the assessee by the Tribunal order rendered
in the case of Pitney Bowes Software India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT for the same
Assessment Year. As per Para no. 3 of this Tribunal order, the TP adjustment
was made in respect of provision of software development services to the AE.
In the present case also, the issue in dispute is regarding exclusion or
inclusion of this comparable i.e. Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. in respect of
the software development services segment of the assessee company. Hence it is
seen that this Tribunal order is relevant in the present case. We also find
that in respect of both these IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 12 of 20
comparables i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd.,
the Tribunal order rendered in the case of Advice America Software Development
Center (P.) Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra) is against the assessee. Copy of this
Tribunal order is made available before us. Paras 14 to 21 of this Tribunal
order are relevant for decision in respect of exclusion of Larsen & Toubro
Infotech Ltd. and Persistent Systems Ltd. respectively. Hence for ready
reference, these paras from this Tribunal order are reproduced hereinbelow.
> "14. Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. As far as this company is concerned, this
> company also renders SWD services. In page-15 of the TPO's order, the
> functional similarity of this company with that of the Assessee has been
> tabulated by the TPO. The objections of the Assessee for rejecting such
> objections has been set out at page-21 to 23 of the TPO's order. The DRP
> upheld the order of the TPO including this company as a comparable company.
> 15\. The grounds on which the Assessee seeks exclusion of this company from
> the list of comparable companies is on the ground that (i) this company is
> functionally dissimilar to that of SWD service provider and that it develops
> Software products ; (ii) Segmental Information of various segments are not
> available; (iii) Scale of operation and presence of intangibles, brand etc.
> 16\. As far as functional dissimilarity of this company is concerned, this
> company also renders SWD services in three clusters, in the form of Service
> Cluster for banking, financial services, insurance, Media & entertainment
> and Travel & Logistics), Industrial Cluster comprising of all manufacturing
> sectors, telecom cluster relating to product engineering services. As
> rightly held by the DRP all the above activities are SWD services. The fact
> that the Assessee mainly caters to SWD services in banking industry cannot
> be the basis to hold that this company and the Assessee are not functionally
> comparable. The difference pointed out by the Assessee are not material
> differences in terms of Rule 10B(2) of the Rules.
> 17\. As far as the objection that this company apart from rendering SWD
> services is also engaged in developing its own Software Products, the TPO
> has brought out in his order that the products developed by the Assessee are
> platforms used by this company to enable design and developing software for
> use by a customer in particular industry. For e.g., the product UNITRAX is a
> Software that enables recording keeping enabling fund and insurance
> companies to manage the administration of their wealth management. Based on
> this software the Assessee designs Software for specific needs of a
> customer. No product is sold off the shelf by the company. Hence the
> objection of the Assessee that this company is a Software Product company
> was rightly held by the TPO/DRP to be not valid.
> IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 13 of 20
18\. The objection with regard to absence of segmental information has been
met by the TPO by pointing out that the whole segment of SWD services was
considered for comparability. The objection of the Assessee in this regard is
not specific and is vague and is on an assumption that this company operates
in three segments. The TPO has pointed out that there is only one segment and
hence this objection in our view was rightly disregarded by the revenue
authorities.
19\. As far as the objections regarding presence of intangibles, it is seen
from the order of the TPO that the intangibles are nothing but Operating
systems, office tools, development tools, testing tools etc., that are used in
the process of rendering SWD services by the Assessee and therefore cannot be
the basis to hold that this company is functionally not comparable with the
Assessee. As far as the objection regarding presence of brand value is
concerned, it has been held by the TPO that there is no intangible in the form
of brand owned by this company. The scale of operations of this company cannot
be the basis to hold that this company is not comparable when functionally it
is found to be comparable.
20\. None of the objections raised by the Assessee meet the criteria for
excluding this company in terms of comparability criteria laid down in Rule
10B(2) of the Rules. We therefore uphold the inclusion of this company in the
list of comparable companies.
21\. Persistent Systems Ltd.: The objection of the Assessee for excluding this
company from the list of comparable companies is on the ground that this
company is also engaged in making software products and is not only in
providing SWD services and that the segmental details of revenue from sale of
Software Products and revenue from rendering SWD services are not available.
This objection is examined in the light of the Annual Report of this company
for 2013 which is at pages 648 to 841 of Volume-III Paper Book filed by the
Assessee. The learned AR pointed out that even in the annual report this
company is stated to be in the business of developing software products. The
reference by the learned AR is to the consolidated Accounts, i.e., inclusive
of the activities of the group (AE companies). The unconsolidated accounts of
this company is at page 787 of Volume-III paper book filed by the Assessee.
The profit & Loss account is at page-793 of Volume-III paper book filed by the
Assessee. Income from operation is Rs.9967.53 million. Note 21 to the note on
accounts gives the break of this revenue which is at page- 814 and it is fully
from providing software development services.This revenue has been compared
with costs and the OP/TC of this company arrived at by the TPO. Note 26 to the
notes on accounts gives the segmental break-up and the segments are all
software services segment and there is no product segment at all. The learned
AR placed reliance on decisions where this company was excluded from the list
of comparable companies. These decisions do not relate to AY 13-14. We can
therefore safely proceed on the basis IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 14 of
20 that those decisions are rendered on their facts prevailing in the relevant
AY. As far as the present AY 13-14 is concerned, the plea of the Assessee for
exclusion of this company on the ground that it is a software product company
is held to be without any basis and is rejected. No other arguments were
advanced for exclusion of this company. Hence, we uphold the orders of the
revenue authorities including this company in the list of comparable
companies."
9\. In respect of the applicability of this Tribunal order for exclusion of
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, this has been submitted by ld. AR of assessee in
the chart submitted before us that on page no. 698 of Annual Report paper
book, this company has debited an amount of Rs. 27,10,89,274/- as cost of
bought-out items for resale. But this fact was not brought to the notice of
the Tribunal in the case of Advice America Software Development Center (P.)
Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra). It has also been submitted that on page no. 706 of
Annual Report paper book, this has been reported that this company is engaged
in sale of services to its related parties and this fact was also not brought
to the notice of Tribunal in case of Advice America Software Development
Center (P.) Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra). When we examine paras 14 to 20 of this
Tribunal order where there is discussion regarding inclusion/exclusion of
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, we find that there is no discussion on these two
aspects that this company is having significant amount of cost of bought-out
items for resale and it is engaged in sale of services and products to its
related parties and hence, in our considered opinion, this Tribunal order
cannot be considered as a binding precedence because this Tribunal order is
silent on these two important aspects as to this aspect that this company is
having sizeable amount of bought out items for resale and have related party
transactions in respect of sales of services and products. We also find that
in the case of remaining three Tribunal orders i.e.Microsoft Research Lab
India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra), WM Global Technology Services (India) P.
Ltd. Vs. ACIT (supra) and in the case of Tecnotree Convergence Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
DCIT (supra), the matter was remanded to the TPO for fresh decision. Hence, we
feel it proper that in the present case also, this issue should go back to the
file of TPO for fresh decision after providing adequate opportunity of being
heard to the IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 15 of 20 assessee and while
deciding the issue afresh, all the available Tribunal orders on this issue
should be considered by the TPO in proper perspective.
10\. Similarly in respect of exclusion of Persistent Systems Ltd. also, the
ld. DR of revenue has placed reliance on Tribunal order rendered in the case
of Advice America Software Development Center (P.) Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra) and it
has been pointed out by him that in this case, it was held by the Tribunal in
para 21 that this company is not required to be excluded but this is the
submission made by ld. AR of assessee before us that while deciding the issue
against the assessee in this case, the relevant page of the Annual Report of
this company being page no. 861 of the Annual Report paper book was not
considered properly and it is pointed out before us that it has been reported
on this page of the Annual Report of that company that this company is earning
revenue from royalty and the company also earns service tax and value added
tax. This is the claim of the assessee before us that VAT is leviable only on
sale of goods and therefore, it has to be seen that what is the quantum of
sale of goods by that company and whether segmental information in that regard
is available or not. It has been submitted that as per the remaining three
Tribunal orders rendered in the case of Microsoft Research Lab India Pvt. Ltd.
Vs. DCIT (supra), WM Global Technology Services (India) P. Ltd. Vs. ACIT
(supra) and in the case of Tecnotree Convergence Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra),
the matter was remanded back to the TPO for fresh decision and therefore, in
our considered opinion and in the facts of present case, we feel that this
issue should also be restored back to the file of TPO for fresh decision in
the light of all these four Tribunal orders after providing adequate
opportunity of being heard to the assessee. We order accordingly.
11\. In respect of software development services segment, we restore the
matter back to the AO/TPO for fresh decision regarding the assessee's claim
for exclusion of Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. and Persistent Systems Ltd.
after providing adequate opportunity of being heard to the assessee and the
issue should be decided after considering all available Tribunal orders for
Assessment Year 2013-14 in respect of exclusion of these two companies.
Accordingly ground nos. 9 and 10 are allowed for statistical purposes.
IT(TP)A No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 16 of 20
12\. Now we decide the issue in respect of ITES segment. In this segment, the
assessee's claim is for exclusion of three comparables i.e. Capgemini Business
Services (India) Ltd., Infosys BPO Ltd. and Hartron Communications Ltd. It has
been submitted before us that on page no. 1429 of the Annual Report paper book
is the relevant portion of the Annual Report of Hartron Communications Ltd.
and it has been pointed out that it has been reported in para 1.6 of
significant accounting policies to the financial statement that although all
other revenues and expenses are accounted for on accrual basis except for
processing charges (Export income), interest on calls in arrears, listing fee
and leave encashment which are accounted for on cash basis. It has been
submitted before us that this aspect of the assessee's argument was not
considered and decided by DRP. We find that as per para 1.6 available on page
no. 1429 of the Annual Report paper book, this has been stated that processing
charges (Export income) was accounted for on cash basis but as per page 1438
of the same paper book, this company is having revenue from operations on
account of rent income, Export earning from BPO, Domestic earning from BPO and
sale of land out of total revenue from operations of Rs. 33,12,01,272/- and
there is no other income in the present year. Hence it is seen that in the
present year, there is no income reported by that company on account of
processing charges (Export income). In addition to this, in the same Para i.e.
1.6 on page 1429 of paper book, it has been stated that interest on calls in
arrears, listing fee and leave encashment were accounted for on cash basis. We
find that as per page no. 1433 of paper book, the calls in arrears were only
Rs. 2,58,500/- and therefore, whether the interest on this calls in arrears is
accounted for on accrual basis or cash basis, it will not have any material
effect on the profitability of that company. Regarding listing fee and leave
encashment, we find that as per note no. '21' in respect of employees benefit
expenses as available on page no. 1439 of paper book, there is no amount
debited for leave encashment and as per note no. '23' as available on page no.
1440, the amount debited under the head Listing Fees is only Rs. 31,049/- in
the present year and Rs. 5,61,572/- in the preceding year and it has not been
shown to us that there may be any material effect on the IT(TP)A No.
2460/Bang/2017  Page 17 of 20 profitability of this company if these two
expenses are accounted for on accrual basis instead of cash basis. Hence in
our considered opinion, this objection has no merit because such accounting of
some income/expenses on cash basis is not shown to have any material effect on
the profitability of that company. There is no other objection raised before
us in respect of inclusion/exclusion of this company and therefore, we find no
merit in this request for exclusion of Hartron Communications Ltd. (seg).
Ground No. 16 is rejected.
13\. Now we examine the assessee's request for exclusion of Capgemini Business
Services (India) Ltd. Regarding this company, it has been stated that RPT% of
this company is 82.32% and in this regard, our attention was drawn to page 140
of paper book. We find that on page no. 140 of the paper book is part of
objections filed before DRP in form 35A against the draft assessment order. It
has been submitted before DRP that Capgemini Business Services (India) Ltd.
has substantial related party transactions to the extent of 82.32% for FY
2012-13 as emanating from the Annual Report for FY 2013-14 available in the
public domain. Annual Report of this company i.e. Capgemini Business Services
(India) Ltd. for the Financial Year 2013-14 is available on pages 1087 to 1268
of Annual Report paper book. It has been submitted that on page nos. 17 and 18
of the DRP directions, this is noted by DRP that as per the assessee's claim,
the RPT% in case of Capgemini Business Services (India) Ltd. is 82.32%. The
finding of DRP in this regard is given on page no. 18 of the DRP directions
where it has been stated that this working is obtained from the financials of
FY 2013- 14 and this is the new information brought before DRP based on a new
data which was not available in the public domain earlier. The DRP has
rejected the assessee's contention on this basis that it is not clear why this
company has reported the related party transaction in its Annual Report for
2013-14 and the DRP directed the TPO to cross verify this information with the
said company and if assessee's claim is found to be correct, then this company
may be excluded as a comparable. In this view of the direction of DRP on page
no. 18 of the directions of DRP, we are of the considered opinion that IT(TP)A
No. 2460/Bang/2017  Page 18 of 20 there is no infirmity in the directions of
DRP on this issue and therefore, ground no. 14 has no merit. The same is
rejected.
14\. Now we take up the assessee's claim for exclusion of Infosys BPO Ltd. as
per ground no. 15. The assessee has placed reliance on five Tribunal orders as
per the chart but all these orders are for earlier years and not for the
current year. It has also been explained to us that direction of DRP is
available on pages 19 and 20 of DRP directions. As per para no. 45 of this
Tribunal order in assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2012-13, it has been
held by the Tribunal that it was held by the Tribunal in the case of Baxter
(I) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT (2017) 85 taxmann.com 285 (Delhi-Trib.) that Infosys
BPO Ltd is not comparable with a company providing ITES because of brand value
and extraordinary events in the previous year relevant to Assessment Year
2012-13 viz., acquisition of an Australia based company which had effect on
its profits. Since before us is Assessment Year 2013-14 and therefore, in the
present year, this reasoning of the Tribunal that there was extraordinary
event in Assessment Year 2012-13 has no relevance in Assessment Year 2013-14.
But this aspect still remains that Infosys BPO Ltd is not a comparable because
of this brand value as per the tribunal order in earlier year. But this aspect
has also to be examined as to what is the comparability of brand value of the
present assessee and Infosys BPO Ltd because if the comparable company and the
tested party both have brand value without much difference then this cannot be
said that the comparable company having brand value cannot be considered as a
good comparable. In the present year as per the directions of DRP available on
page nos. 19 and 20 of the DRP directions, we find that this is not claim of
the assessee in the present case that Infosys BPO Ltd. is not comparable
because that comparable company is having brand value. Considering all the
arguments of ld. AR of assessee, we find no infirmity in the directions of DRP
regarding his decision in respect of assessee's claim for exclusion of Infosys
BPO Ltd. because we find that DRP has examined all the aspects of the matter
including this aspect that Infosys BPO Ltd. acquired 100% of the voting
interests in McCamish Systems LLC and a categorical finding is given by DRP
that the said acquisition has not increased the profitability of IT(TP)A No.
2460/Bang/2017  Page 19 of 20 that company. We also find that regarding this
comparable company also, the DRP has directed the TPO/AO to verify the factual
position in respect of Export Revenue Filter because it has been noted by the
DRP that the TPO has taken Rs. 1675 Crores as export earnings but as per page
no. 26 of the Annual Report of that company, the foreign currency earnings
from BPO services was given at Rs. 1356 Crores. It is noted by DRP that if the
export earnings is to be taken at Rs. 1356 Crores, it may fail the Export
Revenue filter and therefore, the matter was restored back to the file of
AO/TPO for fresh decision after verifying the factual position in this regard.
Hence, regarding the assessee's claim for exclusion of this comparable also,
we find no infirmity in the directions of DRP particularly in view of this
fact that the DRP has restored back the matter to AO/TPO for fresh decision
after verifying the factual position in respect of Export Revenue Filter.
Accordingly ground no. 15 of assessee's appeal is also rejected.
15\. Now we are left with only corporate tax issue raised by assessee as per
ground no. 21 of assessee's appeal and there is no dispute that this issue is
covered in favour of the assessee by the judgement of Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court rendered in the case of CIT vs. Tata Elxsi Ltd. (supra) wherein it was
held by Hon'ble Karnataka High Court that total turnover is sum total of
export turnover and domestic turnover and therefore, if any amount is reduced
from export turnover then total turnover also goes down by the same amount
automatically. Respectfully following this judgement of Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court, we decide this issue in favour of the assessee and direct the AO to
recompute the deduction allowable to assessee u/s. 10AA of the IT Act in the
light of this judgement of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court. Ground no. 21 of
assessee's appeal is allowed for statistical purposes.
16\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed in the
terms indicated above.
Order pronounced in the open court on the date mentioned on the caption page.
