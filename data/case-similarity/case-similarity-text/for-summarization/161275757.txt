she regained her control, accused No.2 unleashed furious dog on her to bite
her. The dog obeyed the command.ofr-.a:c.c_used No.2 and hit her severely. She

Iwixfssagaiinstilactxisied No.3 and 4. Th"e'«.i.m/estigation culminated in
filing of the ',.cha.rge4V'sheet--._and accused were tried. During trial, the
"provsecut'iVonV.?'e><amined 13 witnesses and relied on 16 docu..me:_nts and 3
material objects. Based on the evidence ido"c.umentary and ocular, the learned
trial judge found the accused guilty and sentenced them to various period of
ii/' imprisonment. Against the said Eudgment they are in this appeat
7\. We have heard both sides.
8\. Sri V.Y. Kumar, for the apipe!la.nts_'c--ont.eny:ds..ythat V the accused
appellants areVi*nnocent._ 'i--lowe.ve3i*,. he hégdhver\',( little to say with
regard to on record. Though the learned evidence, we have re-ap_praise_d_
appeal. On reappraisal testimony of the Pro secutrix accused No.1 regarding
sexual her evidence reveals accused had "her not once but continuously for
sevjei*aly.m4o\Vnt:i1§ iahdhhvwhhenever she became pregnant he got
terrninated. Ultimately when she refused, he develop and after this he took
her to M.G. H"o.spit_a|',:.lA5wlhere the doctors medicaliy terminated that ..
preg nancy.
9\. Such evidence has establishes carnal relationship of the accused with the
victim on the pretext of r\ a'\\./ {'?V»i\"' marriage. As seen from the
impugned judgement it was urged before the trial court that she was a
consenting party to the sexual intercourse and therefore, of Section 376 IPC
are not attracted. But, oi'Q_ what transposed given by the prosecutrixﬂ
re_v'e'aV:!s_ sihejjvvas j helpless victim and had to toiildiei-
hand'.l.:'otAv:'ithe accused, who was
obviously--.s_n"e_domin_arit.gp'os'i"tiVo'n'"a"nd also had made her to believe
her'wo.u:ld"'marry"her. .-'3This cannot be termed as her free .e_cori-sent
o'r'V:l_w,iLii'fu| participation in sexual intercours--e.
§There'_fore;'~:l.w.eVVfindulthat the finding of the trial:'"co"u.rt"'-i"i?s_
__o'_n"fth_e medical evidence is acceptable A'regwa.rdsing'«.cha_rge_'for
offence under Section 376 EPC.
Bef0're.....us the learned counsel Sri V. Y. Kumar ' .'Vtho.i_ign:'refeVr'r'ed
to some inconsistency in the evidence of .'ith'eiiwitne'sjse:s, but he has
mainiy questioned severity of the punisvhment imposed upon the accused
describing it as A.iinj~Aust and harsh.
11\. The evidence relating to the charge of rape punishable under Section 376
PC, is formidable as the evidence of the prosecutrix has remained
undis|0d'g,ed_f=_It is also corroborated by the medical evidence ofthe
conducted abortion at M.G. 1-Ios_pita.l., itaoldg that the conviction of the
accuisecigNo.17forjtheiteffefnce punishable under Section 3l7_;6~...1Pc is
well r'o,utri,eje»a.ta5nd the' trial court has reached right,.c.on"cl_usion.
'liVe..,firJ,d no reason to interfere with the same-.
1 2. AS . : rega rci' ' . pun ble u nder Sectio n 307 IPC" we find the victim
had while he was in the house in the companylof ac:c:uv_s4edV_"2«:.jtlo 4, to
plead with him to keep his to rha'rry.....h.er. At that juncture, it appears
he not i to marry her, but became violent and picked ~.Ug),'a sickle and
tendered blow on her. The mediclai evidence has proved injuries suffered by
victim _wer_.e grievous and likely to cause death. Victim's evidence
sdiscloses she was dragged by accused No.1, though she was pregnant and under
distress, assaulted her and attempted /i wit 5 / 1/ If} to kill her with
chopper. It woufd bring the offence punishable under Section 307 IPC. This is
substantiated by the medical evidence. Therefore, we find conviction of
accused No.1 for the offence punishable under Sectilon 307 IPC is also just
and proper.
13\. As regards charge for the offerrfcev'rpiunishaiiiehS"-._ under Section
312 IPC, there islino Zdenjial'-,fr:o,m----.ttie'v.acVc,us'ed 3' that he had
taken the prosec,utrixf"to"i4.G. got. her admitted, where he indvuced her to

and;..,_p'rj.eve.i_'iied.A,iup,on""d,octor to record her
willingi"iless:f.xihiiisof«'th'e»»V-evidence is also unshaken. Therefore,
prosecutrix was subjected to abortion:ofgfherllp_reg_nan~cy at the instance of
accused No.1 bi_fin:gs__,AV'thue off'ence..i'within the purview of offence
under ' ,.Sec.t,ionV'~3§i«»?;'IPC. Therefore, conviction under Section 312
"I.PC7is ailsoftonfirmed.
As regards accused No.2 is concerned, the 3' '~,_Vcha..rge against him was
that he had joined accused No.1 in = ..--rnaking attempt on the life of the
prosecutrix. To this we U see that accused No.2 had unleashed a furious dog at
the victim to bite her. Dog did obey his command, an_d__bit the victim, when
she was trying to escape. Th_'iV's--V..f"i5falso supported by medical evidence
that the docf;o:i'sVhav:e"ifo'uind 4_ dog bite along with other

-Lii<ewi's.e,,.4t'ne"charge against accused 3 and 4 fofihaiving caused grievous injuries to the victim is also "the evidence and it is also supported by the ._riﬂedica:l""_~eviVd;'ence. We find no reason to interfere with the same ' . 
16\. The main grievance of the appellants is that the sentence imposed upon
them is too harsh. we have considered this aspect.
17\. While sentencing the convicted' courts are required to keep in~~m.ind--'_
the"i-p'rin'ciip'l.es...of; proportionality. The courts are also only the
felonious propens'i»ty:of_the"accusediAh.v'co'i1'i'mission of the crime, but

.'assuranceT5,.5'The victim was not financially sound and was virtu~.all'y
living with her widowed mother sustaining from 'minimal resources. In such
situation it is seen that she succumbed to his desire and accused No.1
exploited her on the pretext of marriage. Accused No.1 has indulged in 13
carnal relationship with victim and then not only failed in his promises but
indulged in physical assault wllegn she requested him to bail her out of the
