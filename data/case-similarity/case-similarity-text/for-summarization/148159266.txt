                                               ORDER
Per Dr. Arjun Lal Saini, AM The captioned two appeals filed by the Revenue,
pertaining to Assessment Years 2008-09 and 2009-10 and two Cross-Objections
filed by the assessee, pertaining to assessment years 2008-09 and 2009-10, are
directed the against the separate orders passed by the Ld. Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals), Kolkata, which in turn arise out of fair assessment
orders passed by the Assessing Officer, which incorporate the findings of
order passed by Ld. Transfer Pricing Officer ('TPO') under section 92CA(3) of
the Income Tax Act,1961 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').
2\. Since, the issues involved in all the appeals of Revenue and Cross
objections filed by the assessee are common and identical; therefore, these
appeals and cross objections have been heard together and are being disposed
of by this consolidated order. For the sake of convenience, the grounds as
well as the facts narrated in Revenue`s appeal, in ITA No.1372/Kol/2016, for
assessment Year 2009-10, have been taken into consideration for deciding the
above appeals and cross objections en masse.
3\. Although, these appeals filed by the Revenue for Assessment Year 2008-09
(in ITA No.1371/Kol/2017) and for A.Y. 2009-10 (in ITA No.1372/Kol/2017) and
Cross-Objections filed by the Assessee in Assessment Year 2008-09 (in CO.
No.71/Kol/2018) and for A.Y. 2009-10 (in CO. No.72/Kol/2018), contain multiple
ground of appeals. However, at the time of hearing we have carefully perused
all the grounds raised by the Revenue as well as cross objections raised by
the Assessee. Most of the grounds raised by the Revenue as well as Assessee,
are either academic in nature or contentious in nature. However, to meet the
end of justice, we confine ourselves to the core of the controversy and main
grievances of Revenue and the Assessee as well. With this background, we
summarize and concise the grounds raised by the Revenue as well as Assessee as
follows:
Grounds relating to Transfer Pricing  2 3 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371
& 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 (1).The main grievance of the Revenue
in Assessment Years 2008-09 and 2009-10 are that M/s. Zenith Exports Ltd. and
M/s. Eastern Silk Ltd. should not be considered as comparable because these
companies are not functionally comparable with the assessee company and seven
comparable companies selected by the ld TPO should be treated comparable and
arm`s length price (ALP) adjustment made to the tune of Rs.12,31,02,132/-
should be upheld. Whereas in Cross-Objections filed by the Assessee in
Assessment Years 2008-09 and 2009-10, the main grievance of the Assessee is
that seven comparable companies selected by the ld. TPO should be rejected, as
ld CIT(A) had already rejected six companies out of seven companies selected
by ld TPO. [ vide Revenue Ground No.4(i),& 4(ii), for A.Y. 2008-09, and Ground
Nos.1 & 2, for A.Y. 2009-10 and [Assessee`s CO No.1 for A. Y. 2008-09 &
CO.No.1 for 2009-10] (2) Revenue`s Ground No.3 and 4 are in respect of
allocation of cost between the Associate Enterprise (AE) and Non-AE
transactions and the non- consideration of entity level margin by the CIT(A)
and consideration of transactional margin only.
(3) Revenue`s Ground No. 6, 7 and 8 are in respect of challenging PLI as
OP/Sales and various constituents of the PLI (Profit Level Indicator) which
has been disputed by the TPO/AO.
Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 2, 3 and 5 are in respect of export incentive and
Forex fluctuation which should be considered as part of OR ( Operating
Revenue).
(4) Revenue`s ground No.9 is challenging all the grounds raised by the
assessee before CIT(A) right from 2(a) to 2 (h) so raised by the assessee and
considered by ld CIT(A). Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 4, 6 7 and 8 are in
respect of export from 10A & 10B Unit, and relate to grievance that transfer
pricing provision did not apply to transaction between the 10A and 10B unit,
and to reduce the turnover pertaining to sections 10A & 10B in computation of
arm's length price.
Note: All the above grounds relating to transfer pricing for A.Y. 2008-09 and
for A.Y. 2009-10 are similar and identical therefore, we take Revenue`s appeal
in ITA  3 4 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
72/Kol/2018 No.1372/Kol/2017 for A.Y.2009-10, as the lead case to adjudicate
all the transfer pricing issues of the Revenue as well as assessee`s cross
objections.
Other Grounds raised by Revenue (1). Revenue`s ground No.5 relates to
grievance of the Revenue that companies eligible for claiming deduction u/s
10A of the Act, should continue to remain liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax
(MAT) u/s 115JB of the Act.
(2).Ground No.1 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 (in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017) and Ground No.10 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year
2009-10 (in ITA No.1372/Kol/2017) relates to disallowance u/s 14A read with
Rule 8D(2)(iii).
(3).Ground No.2 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to disallowance of depreciation to the tune of
Rs.15,392/-.
(4).Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to addition of Rs.6,43,440/- on account of
unexplained investment deleted by the ld. CIT(A) admitting additional
evidence.
4\. We shall first take-up additions challenged on account of Transfer Pricing
Adjustment. For the sake of ready reference, grounds of appeal raised by
Revenue and Cross Objections raised by the assessee for A.Y 2008-09 and
2009-10, relating to transfer pricing issues are reproduced hereunder:
Grounds relating to Transfer Pricing (1).The main grievance of the Revenue in
Assessment Years 2008-09 and 2009-10 are that M/s. Zenith Exports Ltd. and
M/s. Eastern Silk Ltd. should not be considered as comparable because these
companies are not functionally comparable with the assessee company and seven
comparable companies selected by the ld TPO should be treated comparable and
arm`s length price (ALP) adjustment made to the tune of Rs.12,31,02,132/-
should be upheld. Whereas in Cross-Objections filed by the Assessee in
Assessment Years 2008-09  4 5 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 &
1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 and 2009-10, the main grievance of the
Assessee is that seven comparable companies selected by the ld. TPO should be
rejected, as ld CIT(A) had already rejected six companies out of seven
companies selected by ld TPO. [ vide Revenue Ground No.4(i),& 4(ii), for A.Y.
2008-09, and Ground Nos.1 & 2, for A.Y. 2009-10 and [Assessee`s CO No.1 for A.
Y. 2008-09 & CO.No.1 for 2009-10] (2) Revenue`s Ground No.3 and 4 are in
respect of allocation of cost between the Associate Enterprise (AE) and Non-AE
transactions and the non- consideration of entity level margin by the CIT(A)
and consideration of transactional margin only.
(3) Revenue`s Ground No. 6, 7 and 8 are in respect of challenging PLI as
OP/Sales and various constituents of the PLI (Profit Level Indicator) which
has been disputed by the TPO/AO.
Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 2, 3 and 5 are in respect of export incentive and
Forex fluctuation which should be considered as part of OR ( Operating
Revenue).
(4) Revenue`s ground No.9 is challenging all the grounds raised by the
assessee before CIT(A) right from 2(a) to 2 (h) so raised by the assessee and
considered by ld CIT(A). Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 4, 6 7 and 8 are in
respect of export from 10A & 10B Unit, and relate to grievance that transfer
pricing provision did not apply to transaction between the 10A and 10B unit,
and to reduce the turnover pertaining to sections 10A & 10B in computation of
arm's length price.
Note: All the above grounds relating to transfer pricing for A.Y. 2008-09 and
for A.Y. 2009-10 are similar and identical therefore, we take Revenue`s appeal
in ITA No.1372/Kol/2017 for A.Y.2009-10, as the lead case to adjudicate all
the transfer pricing issues of the Revenue as well as assessee`s cross
objections.
5\. The brief facts qua the issue of transfer pricing adjustment of
Rs.12,31,02,132/- are that the assessee company is engaged in the business of
manufacturing and export of silk fabric and garments. During the year under
consideration the assessee company has entered into  5 6 M/s J.J. Exports
Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 following
international transactions with its associated enterprises, the details of
which are given as under:
    Sl No.   Name of A.E                         Nature of services     Amounts (Rs.)
    1        SPIN International Inc              Export of Fabrics      20,04,96,006/-
    2        OOO JJ Homes                        Export of Fabrics         94,68,840/-
    3        J.J. Creations SA                   Export of Fabrics         31,26,409/-
During the course of the proceedings before ld TPO, the assessee filed a
Transfer Pricing Study Report and such other documents as were required
together with detailed submissions to justify the arm's length price computed
in respect of the international transactions. The documents and information
submitted during the course of the proceedings were perused by the ld TPO and
he noticed that in respect of the international transactions, the conclusion
arrived by the assessee, in respect of the arm's length nature of the
transaction should not be acceptable. However, the assessee claimed that its
profit margin on transaction with its A.E, was at a higher margin that with
other companies. For the said claim the assessee submitted a working. The
assessee was asked to submit the details regarding the allocation of expenses
to A.E, and non-A.E. In response, the assessee submitted a letter reiterating
the above facts. The ld TPO noted that in the transfer pricing report, the
details of calculation of OPM and search process was very sketchy. The
assessee selected two comparable companies, Viz: Zenith Exports Ltd and
Eastern Silk Ind Ltd. The annexure-E reflecting the calculation of OPM of the
comparables selected speaks of OP/TC, while the assessee has compared this
margin with its GP margin. In view of the above, the TP documentation relied
upon by the assessee was rejected by the ld TPO.
6\. Thereafter, the ld TPO selected seven comparable companies to determine
the arm`s length price and a search process was undertaken which is given
below:
Search Process To determine the comparables a search process was undertaken
which is summarized as under:
6 7
> M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
> 72/Kol/2018 Prowess Database Database was run using the cut-off October,
> 2012 Number of companies which reflected data for the period 2009 18780
> Industry selected "Textiles' 828 Sub-industry selected were "silk and silk
> articles" 97 Sales greater than 1 crore were selected 77 Mfg sales/Total
> Sales >65% was selected 68 Companies with positive net worth were selected
> 60 Export Sales Total Sales >50o% was selected 15 Companies after
> qualitative analysis 7 Final Comparables OP/TC Grabal Alok Impex Ltd.
> [Merged] 37.07% Hanung Toys &Textiles Ltd. 20.45% Jaipuria Silk Mills Pvt.
> Ltd. 28.23% Kariwala Industries Ltd. 26.65% Sharadha Terry Products Ltd.
> 37.01% Silktex Ltd. 13.65% Welspum India Ltd. 13.55% Average 25.23%
7\. After search process, the ld TPO determined the Profit Level Indicator
(PLI) of the assessee company. Operating profit to Total Cost ( OP/TC) was
taken as the profit Level Indicator by ld TPO. Operating profit is defined as
profit before financial and non-operating expenses. The Ld. TPO has considered
the operating profit to operating expenses/cost as the appropriate PLI. The
Profit before interest and tax is considered for computing the operating  7 8
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
margins. However, the incomes and expenses related to the operations of the
relevant financial year alone is considered for the computation of operating
margins of the comparables. The following incomes, which are non-operating in
nature and nothing to do with the operations of the company, are excluded from
operating revenues: i. Interest, ii. Dividends, iii. Provisions no longer
written back. iv. Gain on sale of assets/investments, v. Income from
investments, vi. Gain on revaluation of assets. vii. Foreign Exchange gain,
and viii. Other incomes not pertaining to the operations Similarly, the
following expenses which are non-operating and provisions are excluded from
operating expenses:
i. Provisions other than provisions for bad debts ii. Loss on sale of
assets/investments iii. Loss on revaluation of assets iv. Foreign exchange
loss v. Other expenses not pertaining to the operations.
Similarly, extra ordinary expenses or income which do not recur every year
like donations, preliminary expenses written off are not considered as
operating expenses as the comparison of the profits should be at same level
for the comparable with that of the tax payer. Provisions no longer required
written back has been excluded from profit and loss as these are treated as
extraordinary income and also does not pertain to the business operations of
the taxpayer during the FY.2007-08, as these provisions pertain to the
expenses of earlier year or years but written back during this year.
8\. Based on the above discussion, the ld TPO computed the operating profit of
the assessee and profit level indicator (PLI) as OP/TC, as under:
8 9
> M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
> 72/Kol/2018 Table 1 Sales Rs.64,81,75,212 Add: Foreign Exchange Fluctuation
> Rs. 1,65,66,037 Operating Income Rs.66,47,41,249 Expenses debited to P & L
> Account Rs.63,09,58,946 Less: Provision for leave pay Rs. 19,24,541 Loss on
> Sale of investment Rs. 14,74,211 Operating Expense Rs.62,75,60,194 Operating
> Profit Rs. 3,71,81,055 OP/TC 5.92% Thus, the ld TPO computed the OP/TC @
> 5.92%, on an entity level basis.
9\. Taking the base of PLI @ 5.92%, an entity level basis, the ld TPO computed
the Arm`s Length Price. The arithmetic mean of the Profit Level indicators is
taken as the arm's length margin. Based on this, the arm's length price of the
software development services segment rendered by the taxpayer to its AE was
computed as under:
    Average PLI of Comparable ( see para 6 of this order)               25.23%
                                          Table 2
    Operating Cost ( see table 1 above)                            Rs.62,75,60,194
Arm's Length Margin ( see para 6, average PLI computed by 25.23% on operating
cost TPO) Arm's Length Price (ALP) [ (Rs.62,75,60,194 *25.23%) +
Rs,78,58,93,631 Rs.62,75,60,194 ]  9 10 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 &
1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 Price Received vis-a-vis the Arm's
Length price to adjust upward The price charged by the tax payer to its
Associated Enterprises was compared to the Arm's Length price as under:
Table 3 Arm's Length Price @ 125.23% of Rs.78,58,93,631 operating cost Less:
Sales with Non-AE (International) Rs.41,47,03,175 Sales with non-AE (Local)
Rs. 3,22,97,070 Total Sales with non-AE Rs.44,97,00,245 Arm's Length Sales
with A.E. Rs.33,61,93,386 Price charged in international transaction
Rs.21,30,91,254 Shortfall being adjustment u/s 92CA Rs.12,31,02,132 The above
shortfall of Rs.12,31,02,132/- was treated as transfer pricing to be adjusted
upward u/s 92CA.
10\. Aggrieved by the addition of the ld. TPO/Assessing Officer, the assessee
carried the matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A). The ld CIT(A), having gone
through the submissions of the assessee, observed that comparison of the
company as a whole and that of the comparable itself is bad since Rule 10B
provides comparability of "international controlled transaction", with an
"uncontrolled transaction" only. Section 92F(ii) of the Act and Rule 10B(l)(e)
which deals with arm's length price & transaction net margin method. On a
perusal of the same, it is very clear that net margin method refers to only
net profit margin realized by an enterprise from an international transaction
or a cluster of such transaction and not operating margin of the enterprises
as a whole.

M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
As regards the issues being selection and the rejection of the comparables,
the ld CIT(A) noted that the Assessing Officer has failed to bring on record
any reason for rejection of the comparables so given by the assessee i.e. M/s.
Zenith Exports Ltd. & M/s. Eastern Silk Ind. Ltd. In Zenith Exports Ltd., the
assessee has furnished the segmental report of the said comparable and as such
the Assessing Officer's contention in such respect is not acceptable and
whereas in respect of Eastern Silk Ind. Ltd., it has merely rejected the same
on account of turnover without differentiating the same on account of any
dissimilarity in Function, Asset or Risk borne by such comparable. Hence, ld
CIT(A) noted that both the comparables rejected by the TPO had been wrongly
rejected and same needs to be considered while computing the margin of the
comparables.
As regards the selection of the comparables, selected by TPO, the ld CIT(A)
noted that the TPO had selected comparables, whose product profile doesn't
match with that of the assessee or the chosen comparable doesn't have export
activity or has major related party transaction. Therefore, ld CIT(A) rejected
the following companies:
i) Grabal Alok Impex Ltd. ... ...........Embroidered Fabric, Laces
ii) Welspun India Ltd. ... Terry Towels, Bed linen products
iii) Sharadha Terry Products Ltd. ... Terry Towels, Blanket
iv) Hanung Toys and Textiles Ltd. ... Stuffed Toys, Curtains, Cushions
v) Kariwala industries Ltd. ................. Industrial Garments
vi) Jaipuria Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd. .......... Uses local yarn and as such
product mix doesn't concur with the assessee Therefore, ld CIT(A) rejected the
six comparable companies out of seven comparable companies, selected by the ld
TPO. The reasons for rejection has been given in front of each company as
stated above. However, the ld CIT(A) accepted the comparable "Silktex Ltd.",
as selected by the TPO, and this way, the ld CIT(A) allowed the assessee`s
appeal partly.
11\. Aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
us and assessee is in cross-objection before us.

M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
12\. Before us, Mr. S. Jhajharia, the ld Counsel for the assessee submitted
that the upward transfer pricing adjustment to the tune of Rs. 12,31,02,132/-
made by the ld TPO is not based on the controlled international transaction
with AE. The Ld Counsel submitted that ld TPO had applied PLI of the
comparable on the entire operating cost of the assessee. That is, the PLI
computed by the ld TPO at the rate of 5.92% is at entity level, which is not
considered at all in transfer pricing scenario. The application of the PLI of
the comparable can only be applied to the controlled transaction with AE to
the tune of Rs.21,30,91,254/- and not to the entire result of the entity. That
is, only the controlled international transaction has to be compared with
uncontrolled transaction and adjustment has to be made only to the controlled
international transaction and not otherwise.
The ld. Counsel for the assessee also submitted before us in respect of the
comparable selected by the assessee and the objections and comments on the
Comparable selected by the ld TPO. The assessee selected two comparable
companies Viz: 1) Zenith Exports Limited, and 2) Eastern Silk Ind.Limited. The
relevant data and information about these companies, as submitted by the ld
Counsel are given below, one by one, as follows
1). Zenith Exports Ltd. (Pb 65) Nature Amount Paper book Pg. No Volume of
Paper book Segmental Results Pg. 108 Volume I Turnover 461.60 cr (16.25%) Pg
111 Volume 1 The ld TPO has rejected such comparable without making any
discussion in the order and has simply applied search process on data base
applying certain filters. The TPO did not examine data which was very much
part of the audited accounts of the said company. Since the assessee is also
engaged in sales & manufacturing of silk fabric & segmental results available,
it is functionally comparable and as the rejection by the TPO/ AO is not at
all justified. Hence the company should be considered as comparable of the
assessee and the segmental result as disclosed in the audited accounts should
be considered for determination of "Mean Price" of the comparable. The Ld.
CIT(A) in his wisdom has observed that TPO/  12 13 M/s J.J. Exports Limited
ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 AO had rejected this
comparable due to high turnover and assets this party is not comparable
without appreciating the fact that the functions of the company has not been
disputed by TPO/AO. Since functions are similar to that to the assessee, this
comparable company cannot be rejected. Moreover, in A.Y. 2010-11, this
comparable having similar turnover and comparable assets TPO himself has
selected this comparable. Moreover, in such respect following Courts have held
that turnover cannot be criteria rejecting comparable.

The TPO/ AO rejected such comparable company, without analyzing the FAR
analysis of this comparable and merely applied search process and filters
thereon to derive comparable without even considering this company. Since the
function of the comparable is similar to that of the assessee, only reasonable
accurate adjustment should have been done in case of turnover of such entity
varied from that of the assessee and in this connection we have already
submitted that Rule 10B(2), (3) & (4) read with Rule 10B(e) duly mentions for
such adjustments to eliminate the material differences for determination of
arm's length price. Further, this comparable as selected by assessee had only
16.25% related party transactions (RPT) which is much within less than
tolerance range as considered by various courts in the country which have
considered such RPT (related party transaction) limit at 15 % to 25% and these
judgments are as follows:
a) DCIT vs. Synopsis India (P) Ltd. (2015) 64 taxmann.com 10 (Bang)
b) 24/7 customer.com v. DCIT (2013) 140 ITD 344 (Bang)

Page 42 of case law paper book) [RPT tolerance unit between 15% to 25%] Hence
it may be held accordingly.
The ld Counsel objected the seven comparable selected by the ld TPO. The ld
TPO selected the seven comparable companies to compute the PLI and arm`s
length price.
The TPO in its order has selected following comparable and respective
operating margins is as follows:
    l. Grabal Alok Impex Ltd. (merged)      37.07%
    2. Hanung Toys and Textiles Ltd.        20.45%
    3. Jaipuria Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd.        28.23%
                                                                                                         14
                                                  15
                                                                                 M/s J.J. Exports Limited
                                                                           ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
                                                                           Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
    4. Kariwala industries Ltd.               26.65%
    5. Sharadha Terry Products Ltd.           37.01%
    6. Silktex Ltd.                           13.65%
    7. Welspun India Ltd.                     13.55%
    Average                                   25.23%
The aforesaid comparable as selected by TPO without providing any opportunity
to object to such selections and such consideration of such comparable without
disclosing the function, asset and risk employed by such comparable is bad in
law. Without prejudice, the TPO has not even disclosed the product profile of
such alleged comparable and has already selected from prowess data base whose
integrity is not without doubt and as such selection and employment of such
comparable is bad in law.
The ld counsel pointed out that the TPO/ AO did not make any adjustment on
account of the turnover, asset, employee and the risk profile to such company
and considered such comparable as such without considering these facts.
Without prejudice to the above, the ld Counsel submitted that the upward
adjustment made to the sale value with the AE to the extent of
Rs.12,31,02,132/- suffers infirmity and is also highly excessive. The overall
margin of the assessee is around 20.94% only and hence the adjustment by the
TPO/AO is highly excessive and wholly unreasonable. The gross margin earned by
the assessee from the transaction with AE is at 20.94% whereas the overall
gross margin of the assessee is 6.98% only. The assessee may have suffered
losses on uncontrolled transaction since the gross margin on controlled
transaction with AE is much better and higher than uncontrolled transaction.
Hence, the contention of TPO & AO is grossly incorrect and wrong.
The ld Counsel pointed out that as per Rule 10B(1)(e) which deals with net
margin method, clearly envisages that net profit margin realized by an
enterprise only has to be taken up for comparison. In assessee's own case for
A.Y 2007-08 in ITA No. 201/K/12 dated 12.5.2017 held as follows:
15 16
> M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
> 72/Kol/2018 "19. It is clear from the statutory provisions especially Rule
> l0B(e)(i) to (iii) that it is only the international transaction that has to
> be compared with uncontrolled transaction and that the transaction
> undertaken by the entity as a whole. Hon'ble Mumbai ITAT in the case UCB
> India Ltd. v. ACIT (2009) 121 ITD 13l had held that sec.92C read with Rule

> 341 (Mum.) and wherein Tribunal held that the margin of the international
> transaction can only be compared with uncontrolled transaction and not
> otherwise."
13\. Mr. S. Jhajharia, the ld Counsel for the assessee, further submitted that
Ld.TPO selected seven comparable companies and out of these seven companies
(so selected by the ld TPO), the ld CIT(A) rejected the six comparable
companies. The ld Counsel defended the order passed by the ld CIT(A), so far
six comparable companies rejected by the ld CIT(A) are concerned. However, ld
CIT(A) accepted one comparable company, by name, M/s Silktex Ltd. The assessee
does not agree with this comparable, so accepted by the ld CIT(A) because this
company is not functionally comparable and there are a lot of dissimilarity.
The ld Counsel submitted the details of M/s Silktex Ltd as follows:

                                                                         ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
                                                                         Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
a) This company selected by TPO vide "Prowess data base" has a turnover of
29.84 crore as against turnover of tested party at 84.81 crore and as such
cannot be considered as comparable.
b) The asset base of this company is at mere 23.47 crore as against of tested
party at 64.21 crore.
c) The geometrical segmental transaction of such company has not been given
whereas the AE of tested party is mainly in USA and a smaller party in Russia
& Belgium. Hence, also this company does not qualify as comparable.
Hence, since the Function Asset & risk is not similar and hence it cannot be
considered as comparable.
14\. The ld counsel also submitted before us that in order to compute profit
level indicator (PLI) the export incentive and foreign exchange fluctuation
should be considered. He also submitted that transfer pricing provision did
not apply to transaction between 10A and 10B units, and the turnover
pertaining to sections 10A & 10B units, should be reduced in computing PLI,
and in computation of arm's length price.
15\. On the other hand, ld. DR for the Revenue submitted before us that ld.
CIT(A) was erred in selecting Zenith Exports Ltd. and Eastern Silk Ind Ltd, as
comparables, without considering the fact that these two companies are not
functionally comparable with that of the assessee company. The ld. TPO had
duly mentioned the reasons for rejection of these comparables, and clearly
rejected the M/s Zenith Exports Ltd. and M/s Eastern Silk Ind Ltd, stating
that these companies are not functionally comparable with the assessee
company. Apart from this, the allocation of cost has not been made in respect
of sales to AE and non- AE and in the absence of separate cost records, being
maintained for the purpose, the allocation of cost, cannot be reliable made in
respect of sales to AE and non-AE. The ld. DR for the Revenue also pointed out
that in the absence of bifurcation of costs, TNMM method involves comparison
of entity level margins and not the transactional margins determined solely in
respect of sales to the AE. The ld. DR also pointed out that the expenses like
17 18 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
72/Kol/2018 travelling expenses, fair and exhibition expenses are for the
purposes of benefitting the entire business of the company and the AE as a
whole and cannot be said to be attributable solely to the sales to unrelated
entities. It has also been pointed out that an entity level, the margin cost
is at 5.92% (OP margin) whereas assessee determined the margin on sales at
22.96% based on arbitrary allocation of expenses to unrelated entities.
Therefore, the ld. CIT(A) was wrong in considering the PLI as OP/Sales without
considering the fact that such sales includes sales to the AE and is
accordingly vitiated. The ld. DR therefore pointed out that if these expenses,
like fair exhibition expenses etc are eliminated, similar expenses as is
incurred by the comparable companies should also needs to be added back to
determine the arm's length operating profit so as to ensure functional
comparability on a like to like basis.
However, after considering the submissions of the counsel for the assessee,
the ld DR for the revenue, so far assessment year 2008-09 is concerned,
accepted the two comparable companies, viz: Zenith exports and Eastern Silk
Ind Ltd. as selected by the assessee. However, for A.Y. 2009-10, ld DR
objected about the Eastern Silk Ind Ltd, and submitted to the Bench that this
company has high related party transactions, therefore, the said company
should not be selected as a comparable company.
Apart from this, the ld. DR for the Revenue, to substantiate his arguments,
relied on the judgment of the Coordinate Bench of the ITAT, Delhi in the case
of Headstrong Service India Pvt Ltd, in ITA No.6200/Del/2012, Assessment Year
2008-09, order dated 11.02.2016 wherein it was held that:
> "8.2. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material

16\. In respect of section 10A company`s issue, the ld. DR for the Revenue
held that even if the some units of assessee companies are enjoyed 10A
benefit, the adjustment of arm's length price is to be necessarily done as per
section 92 of the Act. For that he relied on the judgment of the Coordinate
Bench of ITAT, Hyderabad in case of M/s. Wissen Infotech vs. DCIT in ITA
No.99/Hyd/2015 & ITA No.311/Hyd/2015 order dated 28.02.2017 wherein it was
held that:
> "6. Having regard to the rival contentions and the material on record, we
> find that the Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Tata

> portion is reproduced as under:
"V. Whether the TP provisions apply when deduction is available under the Act
?
9.1. The ld. AR argued that its profit is deductible u/s 80IC of the Act. He
vehemently submitted that once the profit from rendering of software
development services is deductible, then, no motive can be attributed for
artificially reducing the profit by manipulating the price with its AE. It was
elaborated that the profit of an assessee, eligible for deduction under
section 80IC, becomes tax neutral irrespective of its quantum. He, therefore,
urged that either the international transaction should not be processed in
terms of Chapter-X of the Act or higher amount of deduction should be allowed
corresponding to the amount of addition on account of transfer pricing
adjustment. This was forcefully contested by the ld. DR.
9.2. Having heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material, we
find ourselves unable to accept both the submissions advanced by the ld. AR on
this aspect of the matter. In so far as the first submission for not carrying
out any transfer pricing adjustment in view of the benefit enjoyed by it u/s
80IC of the Act is concerned, we find that no exception has been carved out by
the statute for non- determination of the ALP of an international transaction
of an assessee who is eligible for the benefit of deduction section 10A/10B or
any other section of Chapter-VIA of the Act. Section 92(1) clearly provides
that any income arising from an international transaction is required to be
computed having regard to its arm's length price. There is no provision
exempting the computation of total income arising from an international
transaction having regard to its ALP, in the case of an assessee entitled to
deduction u/s 80IC or any other such relevant provision. Section 92C dealing
with computation of ALP clearly provides that the ALP in relation to an
international transaction shall be determined by one of the methods given in
this provision. This section also does not immune an international transaction
from the computation of its ALP when income is otherwise eligible for
deduction. On the contrary, we find that sub-section (4) of section 92C
plainly stipulates that where an ALP is determined, the AO may compute the
total income of the assessee having regard to the ALP so determined. This
shows that the total income of an assessee entering into an international
transaction, is required to be necessarily computed having regard to its ALP
without any exception. Thus, the ld. AR's argument that since its income is
subject to deduction u/s 80IC, the provisions of the Chapter-X of the Act
should not be applied, in our considered opinion, has no force in view of the
clear statutory mandate contained in proviso to section 92C(4), which reads as
under:-
20 21
> M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
> 72/Kol/2018 `Provided that no deduction under section 10A or section 10AA or
> section 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in respect of the amount
> of income by which the total income of the assessee is enhanced after
> computation of income under this sub-
section.
9.3. A circumspect perusal of this proviso read along with sub-section (4) of
section 92C divulges that when the total income of an assessee from an
international transaction is computed having regard to its ALP, then, no
deduction u/s 10A or any other section including those covered under Chapter
VIA of the Act shall be allowed in respect of the amount of income by which
the total income of the assessee has been enhanced after computation of income
determined on the basis of the ALP of an international transaction. The
legislature has unconditionally provided for not allowing the benefit of
deduction under any section in respect of the addition made on account of
transfer pricing adjustment. Not allowing of any benefit u/s 80IC in respect
of an addition on account of transfer pricing adjustment pre-supposes the
existence of transfer pricing addition in the first instance to an assessee
who is otherwise eligible to the benefit of deduction under this section. If
one was to presume that no addition towards transfer pricing adjustment is
comprehensible in the case of an assessee enjoying the benefit of deduction
u/s 80IC, then there was no need to enshrine an express provision forbidding
the grant of deduction under this section in respect of enhancement of income
due to transfer pricing adjustment. Once the legislature has engrafted an
unambiguous provision explicitly spelling out the non- granting of deduction
u/s 80IC on the enhanced income due to transfer pricing addition, we are
afraid to accept the assessee's contention, which runs diagonally opposite to
the unequivocal language of proviso to section 92C(4). This contention, if
taken to a logical conclusion, would amount to obliterating the proviso
itself, which is patently incorrect.
9.4. Our view is fortified by the Special Bench order in the case of Aztech
Software and Technology Services Ltd. vs. ACIT (2007) 107 ITD 141 (SB)
(Bangalore) in which similar issue has been decided by the Special Bench by
holding that availability of exemption u/s 10A to the assessee is no bar to
applicability of sections 92C and 92CA. Similar view has been taken by Pune
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of ACIT vs. MSS India (P) Ltd. (2009) 123
TTJ 657 (Pune) and several other orders. The reliance of the ld. AR on the
order of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of DCIT vs. Tata
Consultants Services Ltd. (ITA No. 7513/M/2010) dated 4.11.2015, in our
considered opinion is misconceived, because, in that case, the Tribunal
primarily found that the AO erred in not himself examining the issue of TP and
failed to apply his mind to the TP report filed by the assessee. The last
sentence in para 54 of the order upholding the assessee's contention that no
TP adjustment can be made where the assessee enjoys benefit of deduction u/s
10A or 80HHE, etc., is only obiter dicta inasmuch as the addition was found to
be not sustainable on the other main grounds as discussed in the body of the
order. On the contrary, we find that the decision of the Special bench in
Aztech Software (supra) permitting the applicability of sections 92C and 92CA
to an assessee availing the benefit of section  21 22 M/s J.J. Exports Limited
ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 80IC etc. of the Act is
its ratio decidendi. The ld. AR has not pointed out any judgment of some
Hon'ble High Court deciding this point either way. In view of the fact that
there is already a Special Bench decision in the case of Aztech Software
(supra) which supports the making of transfer pricing adjustment
notwithstanding the availability of deduction under such sections to the
assessee, apart from clear statutory mandate contained in proviso to section
92C(4), we are more inclined to go with the view of the Special Bench.
9.5. It is, therefore, held that the eligibility of the assessee to deduction
u/s 80IC of the Act does not operate as a bar on determining the ALP of
international transaction undertaken by it and further the enhancement of
income due to such transfer pricing addition cannot be considered for allowing
the benefit of deduction under this section. Similar view has been taken by
the Delhi bench of the tribunal in Headstrong Services India Pvt. Ltd. VS.
DCIT (in ITA No. 6200/Del/2012) vide its order dated 11.2.2016. This
contention is, therefore, jettisoned"
7\. Facts and circumstances in the case before us are similar to the above and
respectfully following the decision of the Coordinate Bench at Delhi, we
dismiss the additional ground of appeal raised by the assessee."
17\. The ld. DR for the Revenue also relied on the judgment of the Special
Bench, Kolkata in the case of Instrumentarium Corporation in ITA
No.1548&1549/Kol/2009 wherein it was held that arm`s length price has to be
computed as per section 92 of the Act, in case of any international
transaction, even if the subsidiary company incurs losses.
18\. We have given a careful consideration to the rival submissions and
perused the material available on record, we note that the cornerstone of
Transfer Pricing principle is the comparability analysis of a controlled
transaction with an uncontrolled transaction which is substratum of arriving
at Arm's length price. The controlled and uncontrolled transactions are
comparable if none of the differences between the transactions materially
affect the factor being examined in a given methodology, whether determination
of prices or for profit margin and for such determination a reasonable
accurate adjustment can be made to eliminate the material effects of any such
differences. Rule 10B(2) of Income Tax Rules, provides the comparability of
the transaction with uncontrolled transaction which has to be judged with
reference to specific characteristics of the property transferred or services
provided; FAR analysis; contractual terms; conditions prevailing in the
markets, that is,  22 23 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 economic conditions in which respective parties
transact or operate including geographical locations, size etc. Thus,
comparison of attributes of the transaction is carried which would affect
conditions in Arm's length dealing. Rule 10B (3) specifically provides as
under:-
"An uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to an international
transaction or a specified domestic transaction if-
none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared, or
between the enterprises entering into such transactions are likely to
materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit arising
from, such transactions in the open market; or reasonably accurate adjustments
can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences".
This, Rule specifically recognizes that reasonably accurate adjustment should
be made to eliminate the material effects of differences, if any. Sub-rule (2)
lays down the factors for determining comparability whereas; sub-rule (3) lays
down the standard of comparability. The standard comparability not necessarily
entails complete identity between the two transactions but sufficient
similarity. It can be held to be sufficient similar if the differences between
them is not material so as to effect price or profit in the open market and if
there is one such thing, then such a material difference needs to be
eliminated through adjustments. The factors governing the price or profit in a
transaction may depend upon business strategies, market conditions,
competitions, market penetration schemes, geographical locations, climatic
conditions, etc. Guidelines issued by OECD ( 2017-OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines) also recognized the business strategies adopted by the companies
which have a bearing on profitability levels and profit level indicators
(PLI). Para D.1.5 of OECD guidelines for the sake of ready reference are
reproduced hereunder:
"D.1.5 Business strategies 1.114. Business strategies must also be examined in
delineating the transaction and in determining comparability for transfer
pricing purposes. Business strategies would take into account many aspects of
an enterprise, such as innovation and new product development, degree of
diversification, risk aversion, assessment of political changes, input of
existing and planned labour laws, duration of arrangements, and other factors
bearing upon the daily conduct of business. Such business strategies may need
to be taken into  23 24 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 account when determining the comparability of
controlled and uncontrolled transactions and enterprises.
1.115 Business strategies also could include market penetration schemes. A
taxpayer seeking to penetrate a market or to increase its market share might
temporarily charge a price for its product that is lower than the price
charged for otherwise comparable products in the same market. Furthermore, a
taxpayer seeking to enter a new market or expand (or defend) its market share
might temporarily incur higher costs (e.g. due to start-up costs or increased
marketing efforts) and hence achieve lower profit levels than other taxpayers
operating in the same market.
1.116 Timing issues can pose particular problems for tax administrations when
evaluating whether a taxpayer is following a business strategy that
distinguishes it from potential comparables. Some business strategies, such as
those involving market penetration or expansion of market share, involve
reductions in the taxpayer's current profits in anticipation of increased
future profits. If in the future those increased profits fail to materialize
because the purported business strategy was not actually followed by the
taxpayer, the appropriate transfer pricing outcome would likely require a
transfer pricing adjustment. However legal constraints may prevent re-
examination of earlier tax years by the tax administrations. At least in part
for this reason, tax administrations may wish to subject the issue of business
strategies to particular scrutiny.
1.117 When evaluating whether a taxpayer was following a business strategy
that temporarily decreased profits in return for higher long-run profits,
several factors should be considered. Tax administrations should examine the
conduct of the parties to determine if it is consistent with the purported
business strategy. For example, if a manufacturer charges its associated
distributor a below-market price as part of a market penetration strategy, the
cost savings to the distributor may be reflected in the price charged to the
distributor's customers or in greater market penetration expenses incurred by
the distributor. A market penetration strategy of an MNE group could be put in
place either by the manufacturer or by the distributor acting separately from
the manufacturer (and the resulting cost borne by either of them), or by both
of them acting in a co-ordinated manner. Furthermore, unusually intensive
marketing and advertising efforts would often accompany a market penetration
or market share expansion strategy. Another factor to consider is whether the
nature of the relationship between the parties to the controlled transaction
would be consistent with the taxpayer bearing the costs of the business
strategy. For example, in arm's length transactions a company acting solely as
a sales agent with little or no responsibility for long-term market
development would generally not bear the costs of a market penetration
strategy. Where a company has undertaken market development activities at its
own risk and enhances the value of a product through a trademark or trade name
or increases goodwill associated with the product, this situation should be
reflected in the analysis of functions for the purposes of establishing
comparability.
24 25
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
1.118 An additional consideration is whether there is a plausible expectation
that following the business strategy will produce a return sufficient to
justify its costs within a period of time that would be acceptable in an arm's
length arrangement. It is recognised that a business strategy such as market
penetration may fail, and the failure does not of itself allow the strategy to
be ignored for transfer pricing purposes. However, if such an expected outcome
was implausible at the time of the transaction, or if the business strategy is
unsuccessful but nonetheless is continued beyond what an independent
enterprise would accept, the arm's length nature of the business strategy may
be doubtful and may warrant a transfer pricing adjustment. In determining what
period of time an independent enterprise would accept, tax administrations may
wish to consider evidence of the commercial strategies evident in the country
in which the business strategy is being pursued. In the end, however, the most
important consideration is whether the strategy in question could plausibly be
expected to prove profitable within the foreseeable future (while recognising
that the strategy might fail), and that a party operating at arm's length
would have been prepared to sacrifice profitability for a similar period under
such economic circumstances and competitive conditions."
Thus, business strategies, market penetration, increase or save its market
share are relevant and material factors determining prices and profit and PLI.
All these factors have to be taken into consideration while eliminating the
material effects which warrants some kind of reasonable accurate adjustments.
19\. We note that the assessee has agitated the impugned addition of
Rs.12,31,02,132/- to the transaction made by the assessee with it's Associate
Enterprise (AE) under section 92A of the Act, across territorial border of
India. The assessee has not disputed the fact that the transaction is
"international transaction" as defined u/s 92B of the Act nor the fact that
the transacting parties are it's Associate Enterprise (AE) under section 92A
of the Act. Hence, the lone point remains to adjudicated is only in respect of
addition of Rs.12,31,02,132/- to the transaction so made with Associate
enterprise(AE) and the various contentions so raised in such respect. The
assessee has three Associate Enterprises (AE's) during the year i.e. SPIN Inc.
in USA, 000 JJ Homes in Russia and JJ Creations in Belgium to whom assessee
sold goods/services and details of the sales are as follows:
    Spin International Inc, USA                      Rs.20,04,96 ,006
    OOO JJ Homes, Russia                                Rs.94,68,840
    JJ Creation, Belgium                                Rs.31,26,408
    Total sales                                      Rs.21,30,91,254
                                                                                                                  25
                                                      26
                                                                                       M/s J.J. Exports Limited
                                                                                 ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
                                                                                 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
We note that the assessee had aggregated the transaction at Rs.21,30,91,254/-
made with AE although they are in different geographical terrain catering to
different taste. However, it appears that as the comparables operating in one
particular geographical territory is difficult to search, the assessee had
aggregated the entire sales as "sales to AE" and then has compared with it's
peers. This has not been challenged by Ld. TPO in order u/s 92CA of the Act.
We note that there is no dispute as regards the choice of method. The assesee
has adopted Transactional Net Margin Method i.e. TNMM, as most appropriate
method (MAM). The Transactional Net Margin Method i.e. TNMM for which
parameters as enshrined in Rule 10B(1)(e) has to be referred to in I.T Rules,
1962.
20\. Now we deal with two comparable companies selected by the assessee and
seven comparable companies selected by the ld TPO. We note that the Ld. TPO in
it's order has rejected the comparables selected by the assessee ( Zenith
Exports Ltd and Eastern Silk Ind. Limited) whereas the ld TPO selected its own
seven comparable from "Prowess Database", The Ld. TPO then considered the PLI
(i.e. Profit Level Indicator) being operating margin of such comparables at
25.23% which was compared with operating margin of the assessee at 5.92% and
hence transaction with AE were not considered at Arm's Length Price (ALP). The
TPO then applied this margin of the comparable on entire turnover of the
assessee which was derived from applying on the entire operating cost of the
assessee i.e. at Rs.62,75,60,197/- (vide para No. 8 of this order) and thus
added the sum of Rs.12,31,02,132/- being the derived adjustment of Arm's
Length Price (ALP) on transaction with Associate Enterprises (AEs).
We note that the assessee had selected 2(two) companies as comparables and
such comparables dealing in the same product line as that of the assessee,
were considered and the result of such comparables were compared with that of
the assessee. The comparables and their financial data as was mentioned in the
transfer pricing document (TPR), which is as follows:
    Particular                      Zenith Exports                   Eastern Silk Ind. Ltd.

                                                                               ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
                                                                               Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018

    Average margin on cost = 14.68%
    Average margin on sales - 12.78%
As such the margin earned by assessee from AE at 22.96% is much better than
that of comparables at average of 12.78%, We note that these comparables had
been selected and accepted by TPO in subsequent assessment year,2010-11 having
same product mix and functional comparability.
Now we deal with comparable selected by assessee and objection to comparable
selected by TPO, as follows:
    Comments Comparable selected by assessee
    (i)      Zenith Exports Ltd.:
    Nature                 Amount                  Paper book Pg. No        Volume of Paper book
    Segmental Results                              Pg. 108                  Volume I

The TPO has rejected such comparable without any specific ground and it seems
that since such party was engaged in leather silk & yarn. On TPO's query the
segmental data was duly provided to the TPO. However, the TPO did not examine
such data which was very much part of the audited accounts of the said
company. Indeed, on query during the course of hearing before TPO the relevant
part of such accounts showing segmental result was duly submitted. The
expenses were also apportioned to the revenue and such net result from such
activity dealing in silk fabric (manufacturing & trading both) was duly
disclosed. Since the assessee is also engaged in sales & manufacturing of silk
fabric & segmental results available, it is functionally comparable and as the
rejection by the TPO/ AO is not at all justified. Hence, the company should be
considered as comparable of the assessee and the segmental result are
disclosed in the audited accounts, should be considered for determination of
"Mean Price" of the comparable. Ld. CIT(A) has observed that TPO/ AO had
rejected (his comparable due to high turnover and assets, this party is not
comparable without appreciating the fact that the functions of the company has
not been disputed by TPO/AO.
27 28
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
Since functions are similar to that to the assessee, this comparable cannot be
rejected. Moreover, in A.Y. 2010-11 this comparable having similar turnover
and comparable assets TPO himself has selected this comparable. Moreover, the
coordinate Bench of ITAT Bangalore in the case of Microchip technology (India)
Pvt Ltd (2018) 81 Taxmann.com 389, held that turnover cannot be criteria for
rejecting comparable. As regards segmental results being available, the
comparable could not have been rejected by the AO/TPO, and for which reliance
is placed on judgment of the coordinate Bench in the case of DCIT v. Landis +
Gyr Ld. (2017) 86 taxmann.com
109\. Based on this rationale, we accept this comparable company.
ii). Eastern Silk Ind. Ltd.
    Nature                 Amount                 Paper book Pg. No       Volume of Paper book

The TPO/ AO rejected such comparable without analyzing the FAR analysis of
this comparable and merely applied search process and filters thereon to
derive comparable without even considering this Company.
Since the function of the comparable is similar to that of the assessee, only
reasonable accurate adjustment should have been done in case of turnover of
such entity varied from that of the assessee and in this connection we have
already submitted that Rule 10B(2), (3) & (4) read with Rule 10B(e) duly
mentions for such adjustments to eliminate the material differences for
determination of arm's length price. Further, this comparable as selected by
assessee had only 16.25% related party transactions (RPT) which is much within
less than tolerance range as considered by various Coordinate Benches of ITAT
in the country which have considered such RPT (related party transaction)
limit at 15% to 25% and these judgments are as follows:

> Hence, we accept this comparable.
21\. Now we deal with grievance of Ld DR for the Revenue, about RPT filter, in
respect of the two comparable companies selected by the assessee, viz: (i)
Zenith Exports Ltd. and (ii) M/s. Eastern Silk Ltd. We note that the assessee
is in the business of manufacture and export of silk fabrics. The ld TPO for
AY 2008-09 has rejected Zenith Exports Ltd. on the ground of high turnover
only. We note that the assessee has a turnover of Rs. 64 cr. whereas the
turnover of Zenith Exports Ltd. for AY 2008-09 is Rs.237.25 cr. for AY 2009-10
Rs. 462 cr. Therefore, Zenith Exports Ltd. could not have been rejected on the
basis of the turnover filter and, therefore, we agree with the Ld. CIT(A)'s
decision to include M/s. Zenith Exports Ltd. as a comparable to the assessee.
Coming to the rejection of M/s. Eastern Silk Ltd. We note that the turnover of
this company, for AY 2008-09 is to the tune of Rs.488.21 cr. and Rs.510 cr.
for AY 2009-10. The TPO has rejected this company on the basis that it has RPT
filter in AY 2008-09. Our attention was drawn to page no. 61 of the paper book
wherein we note that the related party transaction of this company comes to
only Rs.41.94 cr. which is approximately 9% of the turnover, (the turnover of
this company is Rs.481 cr). Therefore, the basis of the TPO to reject this
comparable cannot be accepted and we agree with the Ld. CIT(A) that this
company should be accepted for AY 2008-09.
Coming to AY 2009-10, the TPO has made no discussion of any of the
comparables. He has simply gone by the search he has made and has not
considered the TP Study of the assessee, wherein the assessee has taken M/s.
Eastern Silk Ltd. as a comparable case. The Ld. DR drew our attention to the
fact that the said company had RPT transaction of 82.90 cr. which is amount
16.25% of its turnover of Rs.510 cr. and, therefore, he contended that this
company should be excluded following RPT filter. However, the Ld. AR of the
assessee contended before us that for AY 2010-11, the ld TPO in his order
dated  29 30 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
72/Kol/2018 30.01.2014, has considered, the Eastern Silk Ind Ltd. and has
accepted as a comparable, taking into account same facts and circumstances,
which were prevailing in A.Y.2008-09 &2009-10. In such a scenario, even though
the assessee has got a higher RPT and, however, since the TPO has accepted the
comparable Eastern Silk Ltd. for AY 2010-11, we agree with the Ld. CIT(A) that
this company should not be excluded as a comparable. Further, we note that
this comparable as selected by assessee had only 16.25% related party
transactions (RPT) which is much within less than tolerance range as
considered by various courts in the country which have considered such RPT
(related party transaction) limit at 15% to 25% and these judgments are as
follows:
a) DCIT vs. Synopsis India (P) Ltd. (2015) 64 taxmann.com 10 (Bang)
b) 24/7 customer.com v. DCIT (2013) 140 ITD 344 (Bang)
c) Cordys R & D India (P) Ltd. (2014) 149 ITD 587 (Hyd)
d) SAP (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Addl. CIT(2012) 87 taxmann.com 316 (Bangalore AT)
Page 42 of case law paper book) [RPT tolerance unit between 15% to 25%] We
also note this fact that the TPO has not mentioned any RPT filter for AY
2009-10, in his order, therefore considering all the facts and circumstances,
as explained above, we confirm the order of Ld. CIT(A) in accepting M/s.
Eastern Silk Ltd as comparable for A.Y. 2009-10.
22\. Now we deal with the comparable selected by Ld TPO. The ld TPO in his
order has selected following comparable and respective operating margins, are
as follows:
    l. Grabal Alok Impex Ltd. (merged)          37.07%
    2. Hanung Toys and Textiles Ltd.            20.45%
    3. Jaipuria Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd.            28.23%
    4. Kariwala industries Ltd.                 26.65%
    5. Sharadha Terry Products Ltd.             37.01%
    6. Silktex Ltd.                            13.65%
    7. Welspun India Ltd.                      13.55%
    Average                                    25.23%
                                                                                                              30
                                                              31
                                                                                           M/s J.J. Exports Limited
                                                                                     ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017
                                                                                     Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
On appeal by the assessee before the ld CIT(A), the ld CIT(A) rejected six
comparables, except Silktex Ltd. The ld CIT(A) noted that product profile of
these comparable companies do not match with that of the assessee or the
chosen comparable companies do not have export activity.
i) Grabal Alok Impex Ltd. ... ...........Embroidered Fabric, Laces
ii) Welspun India Ltd. ... Terry Towels, Bed linen products
iii) Sharadha Terry Products Ltd. ... Terry Towels, Blanket
iv) Hanung Toys and Textiles Ltd. ... Stuffed Toys, Curtains, Cushions
v) Kariwala industries Ltd. ................. Industrial Garments
vi) Jaipuria Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd. .......... Uses local yarn and as such
product mix doesn't concur with the assessee We decline to interfere in the
order of CIT(A) in respect of rejection of six comparable companies, noted
above with product profile.
However, we note that ld CIT(A) accepted, the Silktex Ltd. as comparable
company. The details and particulars of this company is given below for ready
reference:

This company selected by TPO vide "Prowess data base" has a turnover of 29.84
crore as against turnover of tested party at 84.81 crore and as such cannot be
considered as comparable.
31 32
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
b) The asset base of this company is at mere 23.47 crore as against of tested
party at 64.21 crore.
c) The geometrical segmental transaction of such company has not been given
whereas the AE of tested party is mainly in USA and a smaller party in Russia
& Belgium. Hence, also this company does not qualify as comparable.
We also note that ld CIT(A) did not make adjustments on account of the factors
governing the price or profit in a transaction which may depend upon business
strategies, market conditions, competitions, market penetration schemes,
geographical locations, climatic conditions, etc. Guidelines issued by OECD (
2017-OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines) also recognized the business strategies
adopted by the companies which have a bearing on profitability levels and
profit level indicators (PLI). Para D.1.5 of OECD guidelines are given in para
18 of this order.
Therefore, since the ld CIT(A) has failed to do adjustment on account of
business strategies, market conditions, competitions, market penetration
schemes, geographical locations, climatic conditions, etc, as noted above.
Moreover, since the Function Asset & risk is not similar and hence it cannot
be considered as comparable, therefore, we reject this comparable. Therefore,
we direct the ld. TPO/Assessing Officer not to consider this company as
comparable for Assessment Years 2008-09 and 2009-10.
We note that the net profit margin earned by the Assessee from the controlled
international transaction was 22.96% in comparison to the average net profit
margin earned by the comparables chosen by the Assessee at 12.78%. If one were
to proceed on the basis of the comparable selected by the assessee and apply
its profit margin of 12.78%, the Assessee's profit margin of 22.96% is higher.
Hence the comparison of the net profit margin of the international transaction
of the Assessee in comparison to the net profit margin of the comparables is
much better and the addition so made by the TPO & AO is wholly wrong and
incorrect and therefore, we delete both the upward transfer pricing adjustment
made by TPO/AO for A.Y. 2008-09 at Rs.7,65,00,000/- and for A.Y. 2009-10 at
Rs.12,31,02,132/-.

23\. Now we deal with our concise ground No.2 which reads as under:
"(2) Revenue`s Ground No.3 and 4 are in respect of allocation of cost between
the Associate Enterprise (AE) and Non-AE transactions and the non-
consideration of entity level margin by the CIT(A) and consideration of
transactional margin only."
At the outset itself, the Ld. Counsel for the assessee, brought to our notice
that this issue is covered in the assessee's own case in ITA No.201/Kol/2012,
for AY 2007-08, order dated 12.05.2017, wherein the same issue arose and the
Tribunal was pleased to accept the contention of the assessee and has held as
under:
> "18. We have considered the rival submissions and we are of the view that
> order of CIT(A) does not call for any interference. Section 92F(ii) lays
> down that "'arm's length price" means a price which is applied or proposed

> Sec.92(v) defines "transaction" to include "an arrangement, undertaking or

Mumbai Tribunal in the case Of UCB India (F) Ltd. v. ACIT (supra) observed at
page 8.2 of such order as :
"It has not been disputed that provisions of chapter X of sec. 92C deal with
international transaction only and not with transaction which . have no
international cross border element at all. Therefore, the basis of making the
adjustments on the enterprise level by taking 68.66 crores is not correct
which should have been taken to sell to domestic parties, using Takata
technology & Takata raw material using foreign technology and foreign raw
material. The segment that was to be looked at was international segment, i.e.
domestic sale, using foreign technology and foreign raw material. As given by
the appellant, the operating profit margin on AE sales is 10.49% whereas in
the domestic sales segment it is only 2.88%. Proposition that only
international transaction have to be looked at has else been approved by
various benches of the Tribunal which have been cited by the appellant and are
not disputed by the Ld. CIT(R) and no contrary judgment has been cited before
us on this proposition. We, therefore, accept also that only international
transactions are to be taken into consideration while calculating the arm's
length price."

20\. It is not disputed by the TPO that the net profit margin earned by the
Assessee from the controlled international transaction was 39.25% in
comparison to the average net profit margin earned by the comparables chosen
by the Assessee at 27.072%. If one were to proceed on the basis of the
comparable selected by the TPO and apply its profit margin of 20.91%, the
Assessee's profit margin of 39.25% is higher. Hence the comparison of the net
profit margin of the international transaction of the Assessee in comparison
to the net profit margin of the comparables is much better and the addition so
made by the TPO & AO is wholly wrong and incorrect and was rightly deleted by
the CIT(A).
21\. For the reasons given above ground nos. 2 and 3 raised by the revenue are
dismissed."
34 35
> M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 &
> 72/Kol/2018 Therefore, we find merit in the assessee's contention that TPO

24\. Now we deal with our concise ground No.3 which reads as under:
"(3) Revenue`s Ground No. 6, 7 and 8 are in respect of challenging PLI as
OP/Sales and various constituents of the PLI (Profit Level Indicator) which
has been disputed by the TPO/AO.
Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 2, 3 and 5 are in respect of export incentive and
Forex fluctuation which should be considered as part of OR ( Operating
Revenue)."
We note that the Revenue in A.Ys 2008-09 & 2009- l0 has contended that PLI
(Profit Level Indicator) has been considered by the CIT(A) as OP/ Sales as
against the PLI considered by the TPO as OP/OC.
We note that the appellant has also been engaged in trading of yarn and as
such the consideration of PLI as OP/OC may not reflect the true results. The
PLI as shown by the appellant for the transaction with the AE are as follows :
                                   A.Y 2008-09                  A.Y 2009-10
    OP/OC =                        20.04%                       22.96%
    OP/Sales =                     16.69%                       18.67%
    Therefore, we confirm the assessee`s PLI as OP/ Sales.
We note that in the computation of PLI, operating profit is the difference
between operating revenue and the operating cost. In the operating revenue the
TPO had considered only the sales, ignoring the directly related sums such as
export incentive, foreign exchange fluctuation, and since such items are form
part of the operating revenue and accordingly the operating profit should be
computed, provided these export incentive, foreign exchange fluctuation is
part of the sale made to AE.

25\. Now we deal with our concise ground No.4 which reads as under:
(4) Revenue`s ground No.9 is challenging all the grounds raised by the
assessee before CIT(A) right from 2(a) to 2 (h) so raised by the assessee and
considered by ld CIT(A). Fair exhibition & travelling expenses in OC of AE
Contended by revenue in Ground No.6. Assessee`s CO. ground Nos. 4, 6 7 and 8
are in respect of export from 10A & 10B Unit, and relate to grievance that
transfer pricing provision did not apply to transaction between the 10A and
10B unit, and to reduce the turnover pertaining to sections 10A & 10B in
computation of arm's length price.
We note that these are miscellaneous grounds raised by the Revenue and
assessee relating to transfer pricing.
Fair Exhibition & Travelling expenses in OC of AE (contended by Revenue in
Ground 6). The Revenue has contended that the expenses like travelling
expenses, fair and exhibition expenses should be as part of the operating cost
of the AE. We note that as per the FAR analysis the sales and marketing
function in respect of the transaction with AE is to be performed by AE only
and hence the expenses are incurred by such AE only. It has also to be
appreciated that had such expenses incurred by assessee then the same would
form part of the Transfer Pricing Study as well as the Form 3CEB as well would
have also been part of the Transfer Pricing assessment and adjustment by the
TPO. Since no such expenditure has been incurred, mere contention that the AE
would have been benefited by such expenses, has no relevance nor can lead to
apportionment of such expenses to the transaction with the AE.
The another grievance of the assessee in cross objections No. 4,6,7,& 8 is
that no Transfer Pricing adjustment is required in case transaction exempt u/s
10A & 10B Unit.
We note that as per section 92C (4) of the Act, no deduction under section 10A
or section 10AA or section 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in
respect of the amount of income by which the total income of the assessee is
enhanced after computation of income under section 92C of the Act, which reads
as follows:
"Section 92C: Computation of arm's length price.
36 37
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
(1) The arm's length price in relation to an international transaction [or
specified domestic transaction] shall be determined by any of the following
methods, being the most appropriate method, having regard to the nature of
transaction or class of transaction or class of associated persons or
functions performed by such persons or such other relevant factors as the
Board may prescribe, namely:--
(a) comparable uncontrolled price method;
(b) resale price method;
(c) cost plus method;
(d) profit split method;
(e) transactional net margin method;
(f) such other method as may be prescribed by the
Board.........................................
...........................................................................................................................................................
(4) Where an arm's length price is determined by the Assessing Officer under
sub-section (3), the Assessing Officer may compute the total income of the
assessee having regard to the arm's length price so determined:
Provided that no deduction under section 10A or section 10AA or section 10B or
under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in respect of the amount of income by
which the total income of the assessee is enhanced after computation of income
under this sub-section:
Provided further that where the total income of an associated enterprise is
computed under this sub-section on determination of the arm's length price
paid to another associated enterprise from which tax has been deducted [or was
deductible] under the provisions of Chapter XVIIB, the income of the other
associated enterprise shall not be recomputed by reason of such determination
of arm's length price in the case of the first mentioned enterprise."
Our view is fortified by the Special Bench order in the case of Aztech
Software and Technology Services Ltd. vs. ACIT (2007) 107 ITD 141 (SB)
(Bangalore) in which similar issue has been decided by the Special Bench by
holding that availability of exemption u/s 10A to the assessee is no bar to
applicability of sections 92C and 92CA. Similar view has been taken by Pune
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of ACIT vs. MSS India (P) Ltd. (2009) 123
TTJ 657 (Pune). Apart from this the judgment of the Special Bench, Kolkata in
the case of Instrumentarium Corporation in ITA No.1548&1549/Kol/2009 wherein
it was held that arm`s length price has to be computed as per section 92 of
the Act. Therefore, if  37 38 M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 &
1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018 the 10A and 10B unit sales
goods/services to its AE, the arm`s length price should be computed.
However, we note that in assessee`s case under consideration, the ld TPO has
already included the sale of 10A & 10B units to compute the arm`s length
price, therefore, this ground does not have any further impact and it is only
an academic discussion and does not have any impact on our decision in para 22
of this order in deleting both the upward transfer pricing adjustment made by
TPO/AO for A.Y. 2008-09 at Rs.7,65,00,000/- and for A.Y. 2009-10 at
Rs.12,31,02,132/-.
26\. To conclude, we are of the view that since we accept the comparable
companies selected by the assessee ( Zenith Exports and Eastern Silk Ind Ltd).
We also accept the profit level indicators (PLI) computed by the assessee and
we reject the seven comparables selected by the Ld TPO with detailed reasoning
given by us above. Therefore, we delete the transfer pricing adjustment made
by the TPO in assessment year 2008-09 and 2009-10. Hence, so far transfer
pricing grounds are concerned, we dismiss both the appeals filed by the
Revenue in ITA No.1371 and 1372/Kol/2017 and allow the cross objections filed
by the assessee as per discussion made supra.
27\. In the result, both the appeals filed by the Revenue on transfer pricing
grounds ( in ITA No.1371 and 1372/Kol/2017), are dismissed.
28\. Now, we deal with other grounds raised by the Revenue. The other grounds
are given below for ready reference:
Other Grounds raised by Revenue (1). Revenue`s ground No.5 relates to
grievance of the Revenue that companies eligible for claiming deduction u/s
10A of the Act, should continue to remain liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax
(MAT) u/s 115JB of the Act.
38 39
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
(2).Ground No.1 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 (in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017) and Ground No.10 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year
2009-10 (in ITA No.1372/Kol/2017) relates to disallowance u/s 14A read with
Rule 8D(2)(iii).
(3).Ground No.2 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to disallowance of depreciation to the tune of
Rs.15,392/-.
(4).Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to addition of Rs.6,43,440/- on account of
unexplained investment deleted by the ld. CIT(A) admitting additional
evidence.
29\. Revenue`s ground No.5 relates to grievance of the Revenue that companies
eligible for claiming deduction u/s 10A of the Act, should continue to remain
liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) u/s 115JB of the Act.
We note that clause (ii) of explanation 1 of sub- section 2 of section 115JB
provides as follows: "(ii) the amount of income to which any of the
[provisions of [section 10 (other than the provisions contained in clause (38)
thereof)]] or [* * * *] section 11 or section 12 apply, if any such amount is
credited to the profit and loss account; or"
In this caluse, the words "section 10A or section 10B or" omitted by the
finance Act 2007, w.e.f.01.04.2008"
The purport of this omission was that up to assessment year 2007-08, the 10A,
& 10B units were not supposed to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) under section
115JB of the Act. However, on or after assessment year 2008-09 these 10A & 10B
companies should pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) under section 115JB of the
Act. Therefore, we note that the companies eligible for claiming deduction u/s
10A are continued to remain liable to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) made u/s
115JB of the Act. The issue before us is relating to A.Y. 2008-09 and A.Y.
2009-10, therefore, we are of the view that assessee company is liable to pay
MAT. Therefore, we allow this ground raised by the Revenue.
30\. Ground No.1 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 (in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017) and Ground No.10 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year
2009-10 (in ITA No.1372/Kol/2017) relates to disallowance u/s 14A read with
Rule 8D(2)(iii).
39 40
M/s J.J. Exports Limited ITA No.1371 & 1372/Kol/2017 Co. No. 71 & 72/Kol/2018
After giving our thoughtful consideration to the submission of the parties and
perusing the judicial decisions relied upon by the Ld. AR, we find that the
issue involved in the present appeal relating to section 14A, is no longer res
integra.
We note that assessee has share capital and reserves and surplus which is more
than the investments made by the assessee, in both the assessment years, that
is, A.Y.2008-09 and 2009-10 We note that assessee's own funds are more than
investments, hence, the presumption is that the investments were made out of
share capital and reserve and surplus. Therefore, relying on the judgment of
Hon`ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Reliance Utilities Power
Limited (2009) 313 ITR 340 (Bom) and CIT vs. HDFC Pvt. Ltd. 366 ITR 505 (Bom),
we delete the addition under Rule 8D (2) (ii). As regards the disallowance
made by the Assessing Officer u/s 14A r.w.r 8D(2)(iii) we direct the Assessing
Officer to compute the disallowance in line of the judgment of jurisdictional
Tribunal in the case of REI Agro India reported in (2013) 144 ITD 141 (Kol)
and therefore, Assessing Officer is directed to consider only those shares and
investments in respect of dividend income has been earned during the year.
That being so, we decline to interfere in the order passed by the ld. CIT(A),
his order on this issue is hereby upheld and the grounds raised by the Revenue
on this issue is dismissed.
31\. Ground No.2 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to disallowance of depreciation to the tune of
Rs.15,392/-.
We note that the assets on which the company has claimed the depreciation was
being used by the Company for keeping records and books of accounts of the
company. Therefore, the flat was being used for the purpose of business,
hence, the depreciation should be allowed to the assessee company. We note
that the same issue of depreciation has been allowed to the assessee in the
preceding years hence, to maintain the rule of consistency such depreciation
has to be allowed in this year as well especially in the light of the fact
that the Assessing Officer has not brought any material on record to prove
that such flat was used for the purpose other than the business. That being
so, we decline to interfere in the order passed by the ld. CIT(A), his order
on this issue is hereby upheld and grounds raised by the Revenue is dismissed.

32\. Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue in Assessment Year 2008-09 in ITA
No.1371/Kol/2017 relates to addition of Rs.6,43,440/- on account of
unexplained investment deleted by the ld. CIT(A) admitting additional
evidence.
We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. We note
that Assessing Officer disallowed an amount of Rs.6,43,440/- on account of
information available in the AIR data, which was treated to be unexplained
investment. We note that assessee has made investment during the year totaling
to Rs.6,43,440/-. The assessee was not able to furnish any information or
confirmation from Kotak Securities Ltd. for the above transaction and the bank
statement and the other documentary evident, before the AO, therefore, the
addition was made by the Assessing Officer. The assessee, in the course of
appellate proceedings submitted copy of bank statement wherein such investment
aggregating to Rs.6,43,440/- were duly recorded and reflected and the same
explanation was even filed before the Assessing Officer. We note that this
matter has been duly explained by the assessee before the Assessing Officer
and the Assessing Officer had overlooked the explanation submitted by the
assessee. We note that CIT(A) has co-terminus power as the Assessing Officer
has, that is, the CIT(A) has all the powers as the Assessing Officer has, and
in the assessee`s case ld CIT(A) had examined the documents. Therefore, we are
of the view that since the said issue had been explained before the Assessing
Officer by the assessee and the ld. CIT(A) accepted the same evidence in
continuous of the explanation submitted by the assessee before the Assessing
Officer, and the fact that the ld. CIT(A) has co-terminus power, therefore, we
do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the ld. CIT(A) and his order
on this issue is hereby confirmed.
33\. In the Result, appeal filed by the Revenue and cross objections filed by
the assessee for A.Y.2008-09 & 2009-10, are partly allowed as per the
discussion made supra.
