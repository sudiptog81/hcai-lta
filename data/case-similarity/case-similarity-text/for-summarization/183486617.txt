                           REASONS
         The Sub Inspector of Police, Upparpet     Police Station,
    Bangalore has filed this charge sheet against the accused
    Nos.1 to 3 for the offences punishable U/s.51(B), 63 of
    Copyright Act and Sec.420 of IPC.
         2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on
    23-7-2013 within the limits of Upparpet Police station, the
    accused No.1 being the owner of shop No.10 Jafnas, accused
    No.2 being the owner of shop No.83 situated at National
    Market, Gandhinagar, Bangalore and accused No.3 being the
    owner of shop No.FF9 of Sukh Sagar Mall at Gandhinagar,
    Bangalore were found in possession and selling of counterfeit
    wrist watches in the name of goggles of Rado, Richo, Wester,
    Cartier, Tommyhilfiger, Omega, Calvinklein, Tissot, Louis
    renee, Ferrar companies over which IPR company had
    copyright without obtaining any consent or permission from
    the copyright holder and knowingly infringes the copyright of
    IPR company and were selling the same as if the said watches
    are manufactured and supplied by the copyright holder
    company and cheated the copyright holder company as well as
    the general public and committed aforesaid offences.
         3. The accused Nos.1 to 3 are on bail. On receipt of
    chargesheet this court took cognizance of the offences and
    furnished the copies of the prosecution papers to the accused
    persons. After hearing on charges, this court framed the
    charges for the offences punishable U/s.63 of Copyright Act,
     3                                                    C.C.No.15868/2013.
    1957 and Sec.420 of IPC, for which the accused persons
    pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
         4.   The prosecution in order to prove its case has not
    examined any witnesses. C.Ws.1 to 8 did not turn up before
    this court, hence by rejecting the prayer of learned Sr.APP.,
    this court dropped the examination of C.Ws.1 to 8.
         5. Since, there is no incriminating evidence against the
    accused persons, their statement u/s.313 of Cr.P.C., is
    dispensed with.
         6. I have heard the arguments on both sides.
         7. The prosecution to prove the guilt against the accused
    Nos.1 to 3 has not examined any witnesses on record.              The
    order sheet indicating that on 19-2-2014 charge was framed.
    Thereafter, summons has been issued on four occasions,
    bailable warrant has been issued on one occasion, non-
    bailable warrant has been issued on four occasions, even
    through   Commissioner     of   Police   to   all   the   witnesses.
    Unfortunately, the concerned police have not secured the
    presence of any witnesses before the court.
         8. The shara dated 10-6-2014 made by the concerned
    police indicating that summons to C.W.1, the Police Inspector
    of Upparpet Police Station was duly served. Further summons
    to C.Ws.5, 6 and 8 was also duly served. The process police
    served summons to C.Ws.2 and 3 through telephone. But
     4                                               C.C.No.15868/2013.
    none have appeared before the court.      It apepars from the
    above referred shara that C.Ws.1 to 3, 5, 6 and 8 had
    knowledge of summons of this case, but they have not at all
    appeared before the court for the reasons best known to them.
         9. Further, the shara dated 28-1-2015 indicating that
    summons to C.Ws.1, 7 and 8 has been duly served.           While
    summons to C.Ws.3 and 6 served through telephone.            The
    process police prayed time to serve summons to C.Ws.2, 4 and
    5. It appears even though summons to C.Ws.1, 3, 6, 7 and 8
    has been duly served, they have not at all appeared before the
    court to give evidence.   Further, the shara dated 16-4-2015
    indicating that the process police informed C.W.1 about
    summons of this case, but he prayed time to appear before the
    court through process police. But no requisition is submitted
    by C.W.1 seeking time. Further, the process police informed
    C.Ws.2 and 3 to appear before the court. Further, the process
    police prayed time to serve summons to C.Ws.4 to 7.          But
    none have appeared before the court. From the above referred
    shara made by the concerned police, it is very much clear that
    almost all the witnesses had knowledge of summons of this
    case. But for the reasons best known to them, they have not at
    all appeared before the court. C.W.1 being the Police Inspector
    having knowledge of this case and C.Ws.6 and 8 the police
    staff and officer having knowledge of summons of this case
    have not appeared before the court. Moreover, the concerned
    police have not secured their presence inspite of issuance of
    bilabial warrant, non-bilabial warrant to them even through
    Commissioner of Police. It appears the concerned police have
     5                                                     C.C.No.15868/2013.
    ignored their responsibility.      Since this case is of the year
    2013, by rejecting the prayer of learned Sr.APP., examination
    of C.Ws.1 to 8 dropped. Under these circumstances, I hold
    that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the
    accused persons beyond all reasonable doubt.             Accordingly,
    the accused Nos.1 to 3 are entitled for benefit of doubt. In the
    result, I proceed to pass the following:
                                       ORDER
This court did not found guilt of accused Nos.1 to 3 for the offences under
Sec.63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and Sec.420 of IPC.
Hence, acting under Sec.248(1) of Cr.P.C., the accused Nos.1 to 3 have been
acquitted for the above referred offences.
Their bail bonds and surety bonds stand cancelled. The properties seized under
P.F.No.81/2013 item Nos.1 to 7 in first part, item Nos.1 to 12 in second part
and item Nos.1 to 27 in third part are confiscated to Government after appeal
period is over.
Office to issue direction to SHO of Upparpet Police Station to deposit the
said properties forthwith.
