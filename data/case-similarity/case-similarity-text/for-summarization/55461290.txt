Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short "the said Arbitration Act),
the petitioners have impugned part of the arbitral award dated 17 th April
2012 passed by the learned arbitrator which is adverse against the respective
petitioners. By consent of the parties, both the petitions were heard together
and are being disposed of by a common judgment. The petitioners in Arbitration
Petition No.939 of 2012 were the original claimants in the arbitral
proceedings whereas the respondents were the original respondents in the
arbitral proceedings. For the sake of brevity, the original claimants are
described as 'the claimants' and the original respondents are described as
'the respondents' in this judgment as they  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015
00:00:35 ::: ppn 4 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc were described as such in the
arbitral proceedings. Some of the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding
these two petitions are as under :
2\. The claimant no.1-Mrs. Veena Nalin Merchant is a widow of Mr.Nalin Khimjee
Merchant and claims to be the sole legatee of the said Mr.Nalin Khimjee

in hing under the trademarks "LG" and "LG Engine." According to the claimants,
the said trademarks were registered with the Registrar of Trademarks as early
in the year 1949. Those trademarks were registered in the name of Mrs.Jevabai
Khimjee. Those trademarks including other other trade marks using the words
"LG" and "LG Engine" were used by the respondent no.1 from time to time in its
trade of hing.
3\. On or about 21st November 1942, a partnership firm, as per the Deed of
Partnership dated 21st November 1943, came to be constituted in the name of
Messrs.Laljee Godhoo & Co. The respondent no.1 was originally founded as a
Partnership firm in or around the year 1900\. It is the case of the claimants
that under the said Deed of Partnership, the right to use and ownership of the
name, title, goodwill, trademark etc. of the said firm vested in one Jevabai
Khimjee who was the mother of late Mr.Nalin Khimjee Merchant and late Mr. Ajit
Khimjee Merchant. The said Jevabai Khimjee died some time in the  :::

dated 10th February 1982, the said Jevabai Khimjee bequeathed her entire
right, title and interest in the name, title, goodwill, trademarks, etc. of
the said firm equally to her sons Mr.Nalin Khimjee Merchant and Mr.Ajit

between 1929 and 2003. It is the case of the claimants that in the Partnership
Deeds executed between 7th October 1929 to 17th February 1937, it was provided
that when the said firm was dissolved due to any reason, then Jevabai wife of
Khimjee Laljee shall only have right to use the name of the said firm.
However, in the Partnership Deed executed on 10th June 1938, the said clause
was modified.

::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 :::
ppn 10 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
11\. According to the claimants, in or about February 2010, the claimant no.1
came to the conclusion that she was not being offered partnership on fair or
equal terms by the respondents. The claimants by their advocate's letter dated
22nd November 2010, invoked the arbitration clause contained in the said
Partnership Deed.
12\. On 9th June 2011, the claimants filed a Statement of Claim before the
learned arbitrator inter alia praying for declaration that the claimant no.1
was entitled to 50% share in the right, title and interest in the name,
goodwill, trademarks and labels of Messrs. Laljee Godhoo & Co.-the said firm
and for other reliefs. The claimants also prayed for an order against the
respondents to render true and faithful account of the profits after the date
of death of Mr.Nalin Merchant by the use of names, goodwill, trademarks and
labels of the said firm and for an order to pay to the claimant no.1 50% of
such profit along with interest @18% p.a. The respondents opposed the said
claim filed by the claimants. The parties led oral evidence before the learned
arbitrator.
13\. On 17th April 2012, the learned arbitrator rendered an award whereby it
was declared that the claimant no.1 was entitled to 50% in the said assets and
that the respondents were not the proprietors of the trademarks. The learned
arbitrator, however, held that the respondent firm and the continuing partners
have a right to use the goodwill, trademarks and labels during the continuance
of the said firm, however, on payment of some royalty to the claimant no.1 for
use of her 50% share. It is held by the learned arbitrator that the amount of
royalty payable will have to be worked out by the Chartered Accountant. The
learned arbitrator  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 11
arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc refused to grant injunction in favour of the
claimants and against the respondents from manufacturing, selling, offering
for sale, advertising or dealing in any goods under the trademarks or trade
name or labels described therein.
14\. By a separate order dated 13th June 2012, the learned arbitrator on the
application filed by the claimants under Section 33 of the Arbitration Act for
correction and interpretation of the impugned award corrected the impugned
award to the limited extent by clarifying that the respondents had agreed to a
suggestion made by the tribunal to buy over 50% of the shares of the claimant
no.1 in the said assets.
15\. In so far as the claimants are concerned, they have filed the Arbitration
Petition No.939 of 2012 inter alia praying for setting aside the impugned
portion of the said award i.e. paragraphs 22 to 27 and 33(b). The claimants
have impugned the portion of the award by which the learned arbitrator has
ordered that the continuing partners have a right to use the goodwill,
trademarks and labels during the continuance of the said firm and has further
ordered payment of royalty to the claimant no.1 for use of her 50% share in
the trademarks and directing that the said royalty was worked out by the
Chartered Accountant. The claimants have also impugned the portion of the
award by which the learned arbitrator refused to grant prayer for injunction
in terms of prayer clause (c) of the statement of claim.
16\. In so far as the respondents are concerned, the respondents have filed
Arbitration Petition No.791 of 2012 inter alia impugning  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 12 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc the declaration
made by the learned arbitrator in paragraph 33(a) of the interim award that
the claimant no.1 was entitled to 50% share in the goodwill, trademarks,
tradenames and labels and/or the continuing partners were not proprietors of
the trademarks. The respondents have also impugned the direction of the
learned arbitrator for payment of royalty to the claimant no.1 for use of her
50% share and that also to be worked out by the Chartered Accountant in
paragraph 33(b) of the impugned award. The respondents have also impugned the
declaration rendered by the learned arbitrator that the claimant no.1 was
entitled to the share of deceased Mr.Nalin Merchant in the said firm and such
share should be worked out on the basis of market value of assets of the said
firm. The learned arbitrator has directed the respondents jointly and
severally to render true accounts on the basis of willful default from the
accounting year in which Mr.Nalin Merchant died i.e. from 1st April 2009 till
date and has directed to pay a sum of Rs.3,76,70,305/- to the claimant no.1.
The respondents have also impugned the direction issued by the learned
arbitrator in paragraph 33
(d) of the interim award that the accounts must also be taken of profit, if
any, earned from the use of the share of deceased Mr.Nalin Merchant and on
such ascertainment, the claimant no.1 to elect to receive 34% share in the
profits or interest @6% p.a. on the amount of her share. It is not in dispute
that the respondents have already paid a sum of Rs.
3,76,70,305/- to the claimant no.1 pursuant to the said award.
17\. I have heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the parties at
length and I have given my anxious consideration to the rival submissions made
by the learned senior counsel. Both the parties have  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 13 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc also filed their
written arguments after conclusion of the oral submissions advanced before
this Court.
18\. Dr.Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that on
one hand the learned arbitrator has held that continuing partners or the firm
were not the owners of the trademarks and on the other hand has held that the
continuing partners were entitled to use the trademarks not as the owner but
as a lessees and has also held that the owners of the trademarks were not
entitled to prevent the continuing partners from using the trademarks during
the subsistence of the partnership firm i.e. respondent No.1. He submits that
the learned arbitrator has also held that the continuing partners are liable
to pay royalty for use of the trademarks as licensees which licence fee shall
be determined by the Chartered Accountant who can be appointed by the learned
arbitrator. He submits that the findings of the learned arbitrator and the
directions issued are totally inconsistent with each other.
19\. Learned senior counsel submits that once the learned arbitrator has come
to the conclusion that the continuing partners or the said firm were not the
owners of the trademarks, then unless the owners of the premises would give
consent to the use of the trademarks by the continuing partners, it would
amount to violation of the rights of the owners of the trademarks if there is
any use of such trademarks by continuing partners. He submits that the
impugned award to this effect is contrary to the provisions of sections 28 and
29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999\.

ppn 14 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
20\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that the legal heirs of
Nalin Merchant alone are entitled to use the trademarks and in absence of any
valid licence granted by them to the continuing partners or to the firm, the
use of the such trademarks by the continuing partners of the firm and the firm
would amount to infringement of the trademarks.
21\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that though registration
certificates of the trademarks shows that the partners of the said firm are
the registered proprietors, it is an admitted position that those partners do
not have any title to the registered trademarks. He strongly relied upon
various provisions of the partnership deed and would submit that the
trademarks never belong to the partners or the said firm but it belonged only
to Mrs.Jeevabai. He submits that the said Jeevabai had assigned the registered
trademarks by a Deed of Assignment in favour of the trust being Laljee Godhoo
Family Trust. After revocation of the said trust, the said trademarks stood
assigned to the beneficiaries viz.
Veena Merchant and Vimal Merchant. The beneficiaries have assigned the said
trademarks by a Deed of Assignment dated 17 th April, 2003 to Jyoti Merchant,
respondent no.2 herein and Nalin Merchant for valuable consideration. He
submits that upon the death of Nalin Merchant, his share in the trademarks
devolved on Veena Merchant, claimant no.1 herein.
22\. Learned senior counsel submits that the certificate of registration does
not create title but at the most would be only a proof or evidence of title.
Even if the assignee of the registered trademarks is not shown as the
subsequent proprietor, such assignee acquires the title of  ::: Downloaded on
- 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 15 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc such assignment.
He submits that the parties have to simpliciter make an application for
showing the name of Mrs.Veena Merchant and respondent No.2 as the subsequent
proprietors of the said registered trademarks. In support of the aforesaid
submissions, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgments of the
Madras High Court in the cases of T.I. Muhammad Zumoon Sahib vs.
Fathimunnissa, reported in AIR 1960, Madras 80; (ii) Hindustan Lever Ltd.
vs.Bombay Soda Factory, reported in AIR 1964, Mysore, 173; (iii) Skol
Breweries Ltd. vs. Som Distilleries & Breweries Ltd., reported in 2010 ALL
M.R. (supp) 416 and iv) Cycle Corporation of India Ltd. vs. T.I. Raleigh
Industries Pvt. Ltd. reported in 1996 PTC (16).
23\. It is submitted by learned senior counsel that claimant no.1 and
respondent no.2 are the owners of the trademarks and they have not granted any
licence to continuing partners or the said firm to use such trademarks. The
use of such trademarks without the consent of the owners by the continuing
partners or the said firm amounts to infringement of the trademarks. The
learned arbitrator could not have refused to grant injunction from the use of
the trademarks by the respondents and the same is contrary to law and also
contrary to the findings rendered by the learned arbitrator himself.
24\. Learned senior counsel submits that the award of the learned arbitrator
granting licence in favour of the respondents would destroy the trademarks
property. The license of the trademarks is prohibited. He submits that the use
of the trademarks by a third party who has no connection with the unwilling
proprietor, such trademarks ceases to be a distinctive property.

ppn 16 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
25\. It is submitted by learned senior counsel that since there was no licence
in favour of the said firm created by Nalin Merchant, in absence of such
licence there was infringement of the trademarks. The claimants could not have
been directed to permit the respondents to use the trademarks without the wish
of the claimants.
26\. Learned senior counsel submits that since the owners have acquired the
title in the trademarks, merely because their names were not registered, their
rights as the owners were not affected. The learned arbitrator has though
declared the ownership of the claimants of the trademarks, has further
directed to create a licence which direction is contradictory and would amount
to infringement of the trademarks.
27\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that the declaration
rendered by the learned arbitrator that there was a licence between the owners
and the continuing partners of respondent no.1 is based on no material in
existence. The said finding is based on no evidence. He submits that Mrs.Veena
Merchant, claimant no.1, who is held to be 50% owner of the trademarks has not
granted any licence in favour of the respondents and in fact had objected to
use of the trademarks by the respondents. He submits that unless all the
owners of the trademarks agreed to grant the licence and that also after
following the requirements of law, a valid licence cannot be granted.
28\. Learned senior counsel submits that even if there was no objection to the
use of the trademarks by a third party by one of the  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 17 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc owners of the
trademarks, it could not in law and did not in fact result into the valid
licence to use the trademarks. He submits that it was not even the case of the
respondents that there was any licence granted by the owners in favour of the
respondents to use the trademarks. It was the case of the respondents that the
said trademarks belong to respondent no.1 firm and the continuing partners.
The declaration rendered by the learned arbitrator is thus contrary to even
the submission of the respondents.
29\. Learned senior counsel submits that the learned arbitrator could not have
directed the Chartered Accountant to decide the terms of the licence and to
ascertain the royalty payable by the respondents to the claimants, which is
totally illegal. He submits that after 1963, in none of the partnership deed
there was a provision for giving any right to respondent no.1 firm to use the
trademarks. There is no concept of perpetual licence in the trademark law. He
submits that none of the partnership deed shows any licence alleged to have
been created in favour of the respondents by the owners. Even if any licence
was created by the erstwhile owner, on the death of the owner / licensor, the
licence came to an end. No fresh licence was created by the said Mrs.Veena
Merchant in favour of the respondents.
30\. Learned senior counsel submits that since one of the co-
owner is unwilling to grant licence, the learned arbitrator could not have
given any direction to such a co-owner to grant licence in favour of the
respondents. He submits that even if the trademark is used without any
stoppage and used continuously, that would not create any licence in favour of
the respondent or would not create any rights of any nature  ::: Downloaded on
- 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 18 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc whatsoever. There
cannot be any estoppel against any of the heirs of Nalin Merchant even if
respondent no.1 has been using the trademarks and goodwill for last 60 years.
31\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that if there is no
trade connection between the owners and the proprietors of the trademarks, it
would amount to trafficking in trademark. It would be construed as if the
claimants were dealers in the trademark, which is not permissible. Learned
senior counsel placed reliance on the definition of "mark" under section 2(m)
and the definition of trademark under section 2(i)(zb)(ii). He also placed
reliance on the definition of "proper use" under section 2(1)(r)(i)(a).
32\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants relied upon Rule 80 of the
Trademark Rules, 2002 which provides for application for registration as a
registered user of a registered trademark and would submit that even under the
said provision, the precise ownership between the registered proprietor and
the proposed registered user has to be shown in the application for
registration as the registered user. Reliance is also placed on Rules 81 and
82 of the Trade Mark Rules, 2002. He submits that the registered user has to
be in respect of the registered trademark, whereas the common licence can be
in respect of the registered as well as unregistered trademark. Reliance is
also placed by learned senior counsel on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of Gujarat Bottling Co. vs. Coca Cola Co. reported in AIR 1995 SC
2372 and more particularly paragraph 10. Reliance is also placed on the
judgment of the Pepsi Foods vs. Jai Drinks (P) Ltd., reported in 1996 (36) DRJ
711 and  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 19 arbp-939.12 &
791.12(j).doc more particularly paragraphs 2, 3, 6 to 12 and it is submitted
that the connection in trade is required for both i.e. registered user as well
as under the common liability otherwise there would be a trafficking.
33\. Learned senior counsel submits that even if there would have been an
agreement entered into by the claimants granting licence, if the licensors
were not willing to enforce such licence, no suit for specific performance to
grant a licence could be filed by the respondents. Only the suit for damages
could have been filed. In case of trademark connection in trade is required to
be maintained whereas exploitation of patent by the licensor does not require
any control by the owner. Further in the case of copyright, exploitation is
permitted and no connection or control is required. Nothing further is
required to be done by the owner in case of patent and copyright to sustain
the validity of such licence. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of
Chancery Division in the case of Powell v. Head reported in 1879, Vol.XII 686
and the relevant paragraphs at page 689.
34\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants placed reliance on clause 6 of
the Partnership Deed and would submit that the learned arbitrator has rightly
rendered a fining of fact on the interpretation of the said clause which
provided that the ownership of the rights in the goodwill, trademarks, trade
names, labels etc. of Laljee Godhoo & Co. was solely, exclusively and
absolutely belonging to Nalin Merchant and Mrs.Jyoti Merchant. No interference
is permissible with such finding of fact rendered by the learned arbitrator.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 :::
ppn 20 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
35\. Learned senior counsel then submits that any of the assets of the
partnership can be allotted to one or two partners. In support of this
submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance on Halsbury's Laws of
England, fourth edition, Volume 35, paragraph 111 and also Lindley & Banks on
Partnership, 17th edition, paragraph 18.43 at page 520. He also placed
reliance on the commentary on ST Desai's on partnership 7th edition (2009),
page 124 and 134. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Addanki
Narayanappa vs. Bhaskara Krishnappa, AIR 1966 SC, 1300, Arjun Kanoji Tankar
vs. Santaram K. Tankar (1969) 3 SCC, 555, para 13, Sujan Suresh Sawant vs.
Dr.K. K. Desai, AIR 2004 Bom. 46, paragraph 37 and Jamnadas vs. Ramadhar, AIR
1922, Nagpur 70.
36\. Insofar as the direction of the learned arbitrator to take up the
accounts of respondent no.1 firm for determining the share of the heirs of
Nalin Merchant is concerned, it is submitted by learned senior counsel that
the said direction is rightly issued by the learned arbitrator in paragraphs
28 to 32 of the impugned award. It was not the case of the continuing partners
that the share of the legal heirs of Nalin Merchant was ascertained or that
any ascertainment accounts was accepted by the heirs of Nalin Merchant.
Reliance is placed on clause 17 of the Deed of Partnership and it is submitted
that under the said provision the heirs and legal representatives of the
deceased partner have right to receive the amount if any, which may be
standing his or her accounts with the partnership and share in profit if any,
up to the date of demise of such a partner.
37\. He submits that under clauses 16 and 19 of the Partnership Deed dated
14th June, 2003, the heirs of the said Nalin Merchant were  ::: Downloaded on
- 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 21 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc entitled to have
general and proper accounts taken and all assets valued and only after the
accounts were drawn and the assets were valued at the market value the share
of the deceased partner standing to his credit can be determined. Learned
senior counsel for the claimants submits that the entries in the trademark
register do not determine inter-se arrangement between the parties. The
partners amongst themselves can agree that the particular asset was belonging
to the individual partner. The ownership and licence are two different things
and the licensee can never claim to be the owner of a trademark.
38\. He submits that the respondent no.1 firm had continued paying the royalty
to the trustees at the relevant time who were owners of the said trademark. He
submits that continuing partners are estopped from contending that the
continuing partners became the owners of the the trademarks. Learned senior
counsel submits that the entries were made in the trademark registers showing
the names of all the partners trading in the name of the firm as the owners to
ensure that the validity of the trademarks did not become vulnerable and was
not jeopardized by the absence of any written agreement of licence. A firm
being an unincorporated body cannot be the owner of a trademark and cannot be
shown as owner or proprietor in the trade mark register. It is submitted that
the fact that only two partners were the owners and that the firm used
trademarks only as a licensee is not negatived in the entries in the register
which showed by the partners trading in the name of the partners as firm.
39\. Learned senior counsel for the claimants submits that the owners cannot
be forced by any order, decree or award to continue to  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 22 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc allow the firm or
any other persons to use the trademark if they were not willing to do so.
40\. Insofar as the direction of the learned arbitrator regarding the accounts
are concerned, it is submitted by learned senior counsel that any accounts
accepted by Nalin Merchant during his life time could not bind his legal
heirs. He submits that date of death of Nalin Merchant was 1 st November, 2009
and thus the balance sheet as on 31 st March, 2009 was not signed by Nalin
Merchant admittedly. He submits that the valuation therefore was required to
be taken as on 1st November, 2009 since his share was required to be
ascertained on the date of his death. He submits that there can be accretion
to the assets between 1 st April, 2009 and 1st November, 2009 resulting in
increase in valuation of the assets during that period. It is submitted that
the learned arbitrator has thus rightly directed that fresh valuation should
be made as on the date of death of the said deceased.
41\. Per Contra, Mr.Sancheti, learned senior counsel for the respondents
invited my attention to the documents forming part of compilation and would
submit that the entries in the trade mark register from inception i.e. since
1949 onwards show that the name of all the partners of the firm had been
entered into as proprietors of the trademarks. He submits that each time a
fresh Deed of Partnership was entered into, fresh entry was made in the trade
mark register to record the names of the proprietors of the trade marks being
the then partners of the firm. He placed reliance on section 2(v) of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999 which defines the term "registered proprietor", the definition
of the trade  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 23 arbp-939.12 &
791.12(j).doc mark under section 2(zb), section 6 of the said Act, section 17
and would submit that under those provisions referred to aforesaid, by virtue
of the entries in the trade mark register, the respondents herein are
registered proprietors and have been exclusively using the trademarks in
relation to the goods with which they were connected in the course of trade.
42\. He submits that the respondents herein being registered as such for
exclusive right to use the trademarks, there was no question of licence or
permissible user under the said Act granted to the respondents by the
claimants or their predecessor. Reliance is also placed on section 6(4) of the
Trade Marks Act. It is submitted that the said provisions makes it clear that
no notice of any trust, express or implied or constructive, shall be entered
in the register and no such notice shall be receivable by the Registrar.
43\. Learned senior counsel for the respondents placed reliance on clause 17
of the Partnership Deed and would submit that upon the death or retirement or
adjudication of any partnership as an insolvent, the firm is not dissolved and
the remaining partners are entitled to continue the business. He submits that
the learned arbitrator has accordingly held that so long as the firm's right
to use the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels the same could be
allowed to be taken away by a person who is not a partner. He submits that the
parties had thus agreed under the said clause 17 of the Partnership Deed that
the trademarks shall be used jointly during the continuance of the firm for
the purpose of the business of the firm and accordingly entries were made in
the trademark registry as joint proprietors. In support of this proposition,
learned senior  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:35 ::: ppn 24 arbp-939.12
& 791.12(j).doc counsel placed reliance on section 24 of the Trade Marks Act
which provides for jointly owned trademarks.
44\. Reliance is also placed on section 28 of the said Act and it is submitted
that when the parties intend to use the trademarks jointly and on behalf of
all of them in relation to an article with which all of them were connected,
only and only then such persons may be registered as joint proprietors. The
said Act does not permit registration as joint proprietors where the intention
is to use the trademark independently or stop the others from using it. He
submits that the parties had agreed as regards the world at large and had
agreed that the trademarks shall be jointly owned during the subsistence of
the partnership and the partners who are registered proprietors shall be
jointly entitled to use it. It was agreed that the trademarks and related
assets shall not be taken into consideration while preparing the general
accounts. He submits that it was agreed by and between the parties that only
upon determination of the firm Nalin Merchant and Ms.Jyoti Merchant could
claim rights as regards the trademarks. Such provisions were made only for
accounting purposes and not as to determine the right of the partners to use
the trademarks.
45\. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submits that when the persons
are registered as joint proprietors, the exclusive right to use the same shall
not be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any
other of those and each has the same rights as against other persons.

ppn 25 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
46\. Learned senior counsel for the respondents placed reliance on sections 37
to 40 of the Trade Marks Act which provide for assignment and transmission of
registered trademarks. Section 38 provides that the registered trademarks
shall be assignable whether with or without goodwill of the business concerned
and in respect either of all the goods or services in respect of which the
trademark is registered.
Certain restrictions are provided under section 40 on the assignment or
transmission where multiple exclusive rights in a trademark would be created.
He submits that the trademark being an incorporeal property not being movable
or immovable property, has no existence independent of the said Act and can
only be dealt with / transmitted strictly in accordance with the provisions of
law. He placed reliance on section 2(zc) of the said Act which defines the
term "transmission". He submits that the registration or transmission as joint
proprietor is not permissible unless its intention to use it on behalf of all.
Learned senior counsel submits that section 40 prohibits transmission and
assignment which would result in creation of rights in more than one person
and result in multiple exclusive user of the said trademark.
47\. Learned senior counsel submits that in accordance with clause 17 of the
said Partnership Deed, respondent no.1 firm had offered claimant no.1 to join
the partnership as a sleeping partner of the firm considering her age of 75
years with 34% share in the profit and loss in the firm, which was the share
of late Nalin Merchant in the said firm and had also forwarded the draft Deed
of Partnership, however, the claimant no.1 declined the said offer and refused
to become the partner of the firm.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 26 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
48\. Learned senior counsel submits that if the transmission is permitted then
it would result in the trademark becoming vulnerable and would make it
entirely unusable and worthless which would clearly fall within the mischief
of section 40 of the Trade Marks Act. Mr.Sancheti, learned senior counsel for
the respondents placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of M/s.Power Control Applianc & Ors. vs. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd.,
reported in (1994) 2 SCC 448 and in particular paragraphs 41 and 42 and it is
submitted that there can be only one mark, one source and one proprietor. The
Supreme Court has held that it cannot have two origins. The joint proprietors
must use the trademark jointly for the benefit of all. It cannot be used in
rivalry and in competition with each other. Mr.Sancheti distinguished the
judgments relied upon by Dr.Tulzapurkar.
49\. Mr.Sancheti also placed reliance on the following judgments/commentary :-

50\. Mr.Sancheti submits that since the continuing partners are registered
proprietors, no licence is required to use the trademarks, and the same can be
used by them in continuance of the said firm. He submits that the respondents
have also impugned direction of the learned arbitrator directing the
respondents herein to pay some royalty to claimant no.1 for the use of use 50%
share to be worked out by the Chartered Accountant. Since both the parties
have impugned that part of the award, he submits that the said direction
deserves to be set aside.
51\. Insofar as the direction of the learned arbitrator that the valuation of
the assets has to be done on the basis of the market value is concerned, he
submits that the said direction is contrary to the established  ::: Downloaded
on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 28 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc rule of
commercial practice and accountancy and to the express term of clause 17 of
the Partnership Deed which suggested that the claimants were only entitled to
the amounts standing at the foot of the capital account of Nalin Merchant and
share in profits upto the date of his death i.e. 1st November, 2009. The
respondents have already paid a sum of Rs.3,76,70,305/- to claimant no.1 which
was actually the amount due at the foot of the account of the said Nalin
Merchant as on the date of his death i.e. 1st November, 2009.
52\. Learned senior counsel submits that under clause 18 of the Partnership
Deed, it was provided that on the determination of the partnership, a full and
general account shall be taken of the existing assets mentioned in clause 6
and if necessary, the same shall be valued or to be sold, realized and applied
in paying and discharging the tax and liabilities of the firm. Reliance is
also placed on clause 19 of the Partnership Deed which provided that full and
general accounts were to be taken only in the event of the retirement or
removal of the partner and not otherwise.
53\. Learned senior counsel submits that the position of the legal heir of the
deceased partner cannot be equated with all the out going / retiring partner
under clause 19 and in holding that the assets were to be valued at the market
value under clause 17. The findings of the learned arbitrator to this effect
are contrary to the express term of the Partnership Deed.
54\. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submits that respondent no.1
firm had not followed the practice as appearing from the  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 29 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc books of account
and profit and loss accounts of the firm for the last several years, including
last 3 to 4 years for valuing the assets on the market value at the end of
each financial year but had followed the practice of valuation of the assets
at the book value. He submits that the finding of the learned arbitrator that
under clause 16 of the Partnership Deed, a fresh valuation of the assets is to
be done by market value is patently illegal and perverse.
55\. Learned senior counsel submits that there was no warrant for revaluation
of the assets under clause 16 of the Partnership Deed as of 1 st November,
2009 as clause16 only concerned the annual accounts. He submits that the
learned arbitrator has issued a direction to render the accounts on willful
default basis from 1st November, 2009 which direction is totally perverse and
illegal.
56\. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the oral evidence of
Mr.Chandrahas Dayal, the witness examined by the claimants and in particular
reply to question no.172, who admitted that in the given business if the
business was being liquidated, the market value of the assets is relevant. He
deposed that it was necessary that for the liquidated value, the market value
of all the assets would be relevant. Learned senior counsel submits that the
said witness of the claimants was offered inspection of books of accounts of
respondent no.1 firm for last 3 to 4 years, including the details of the
valuation of the immovable properties as disclosed in the balance sheet on a
year to year basis which demonstrated that no valuation of the assets was done
on the basis of the market value at the end of each financial year. The
witness of the  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 30 arbp-939.12
& 791.12(j).doc claimants admitted in the cross-examination and more
particularly in questions 48 to 63 and 130 that there was no valuation at the
market price or there was no revaluation of the assets in the books of
accounts of the firm from the financial years 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008
and 2008-2009.
57\. Mr.Sancheti placed reliance on various judgments of the Supreme Court in
support of the submission that during the continuance of the firm, assets of
the firm are to be valued at cost or market value whichever is lower. However
in taking accounts for the purpose of dissolution, the assets would be valued
on a real basis and not at cost or at their other value appearing in the
books. He submits that the direction of the learned arbitrator for valuation
of the assets on the basis of the market value is contrary to the settled law,
commercial practice, settled accountancy practice and also contrary to the
terms of the contract.
58\. Insofar as the direction of the learned arbitrator that the accounts
shall be rendered on the basis of willful default is concerned, learned senior
counsel submits that the respondents had already furnished the complete
accounts of the firm including its audited accounts, profit and loss account
and the balance sheet to the auditors / Chartered Accountant nominated by the
claimants. The claimants had led evidence of Mr.Chandrahas Dayal, a Chartered
Accountant who admitted during his evidence having received all the accounts
as also the documents / information and/or explanation sought by them. The
respondents herein through their advocate's letter dated 17 th March, 2010
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 31 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
had forwarded the balance sheet and the profits and loss account of the firm
as on 31st March, 2009, the accounts of the firm for the year 2008- 2009, the
details of the capital account of Nalin Merchant as of 2008-
2009 and from 1st April, 2009 to 30th October, 2009 etc.
59\. He submits that the claimants were further informed by the respondents
through their advocate that there was no change in the accounts that were
verified by the claimants and their auditors Mr.Shenal Shah. He submits that
the complete inspection of all the accounts and said related document was also
given to the claimants even after the commencement of the arbitration
proceedings. The claimants have never raised any objection to the correctness
of the books of account, nor led any evidence to prove that there was any
willful default on the part of the respondents. He submits that the learned
arbitrator has completely overlooked these aspects and without giving any
finding or rendering the reasons came to the perverse conclusion that the
accounts be rendered on the basis of willful default without any evidence
being led in that regard by the claimants. In support of this submission,
learned senior counsel placed reliance on several judgments referred to
aforesaid.
60\. Learned senior counsel submits that the learned arbitrator has attempted
to adjudicate the rights between the parties based on his concept and
understanding of equity contrary to the terms of clause 17 of the Partnership
Deed. The learned arbitrator has acted beyond the terms of the contract
between the parties. In support of this submission, learned senior counsel
placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Rajasthan vs. Navbharat Construction (supra) and in  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 32 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc particular
paragraph 27 and the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Tripura vs. Sabitri Salt Suppliers (supra) and in particular paragraph 12
thereof.
61\. Learned senior counsel submits that the the direction of the learned
arbitrator that the accounts must be taken of the profits if any earned from
the use of the share of the deceased Nalin Merchant and on such ascertainment,
the claimant no.1 could elect to receive 34% share in the profits or in the
alternate 6% interest on the amount of her share is contrary to clause 17 of
the Partnership Deed which provided that the legal heirs of the deceased
partner were entitled only to the share in profits upto the date of death. He
submits that claimant no.1 has been already paid the amount of
Rs.3,76,07,305/- by respondent no.1 firm being the amount standing to the
capital account of late Nalin Merchant as on the date of his death.
62\. Learned senior counsel submits that the learned arbitrator has acted
contrary to the express term of the contract and more particularly clauses 16
to 19 of the Partnership Deed. The learned arbitrator could not have directed
the respondents to pay the claimants only on the basis of the market value of
the assets without considering the liabilities of the said firm on the date of
the death of Nalin Merchant. The award shows non-application of mind on the
part of the learned arbitrator on this issue. He submits that no accounts were
required to be made prior to 31st March, 2009. All the accounts upto the said
period were accepted by the said Nalin Merchant during his life time. He
submits that the question as to whether upto 31st March, 2009 the accounts
were signed  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 33 arbp-939.12 &
791.12(j).doc by Nalin Merchant or not could not be reopened. The learned
arbitrator has not given any direction or finding that the accounts upto 31st
March, 2009 also should be reopened. The claimants have not challenged that
part of the award in the arbitration petition filed by the claimants.
63\. Learned senior counsel submits that the claimants could claim the share
in the profit only upto the date of death of Nalin Merchant after adjusting
the liabilities of the said firm upto the said date. He submits that no share
of husband of claimant no.1 in the said firm was utilized by the said firm.
The rights of the claimants were crystallised on the date of death of the said
Nalin Merchant. It is submitted in the alternate that no capital account was
utilized by the firm and thus there was no question of the share in the profit
for the period subsequent to the date of this death.
64\. Mr.Sancheti placed reliance on sections 42 and 48 of the Partnership Act,
1932 and would submit that though there was no dissolution upon the death of
Nalin Merchant and though the parties had agreed under clause 17 of the
Partnership Deed that there would be no dissolution upon the death of any of
the partner, the learned arbitrator has treated such situation akin to
dissolution of the firm and issued the directions for valuation of the assets
on the market value which is contrary to the contract entered into between the
parties. Learned senior counsel for the respondents submits that even if
section 48 has to be applied, it has to be applied in toto, and not any
particular part thereof.
65\. In rejoinder, Dr.Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel for the claimants
submits that registration certificate issued by the authorities  :::
Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 34 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act is not title by itself. The
partnership firm cannot be the owner of the trademark as the partnership firm
is not a legal entity. Reliance is once again placed on the provisions of the
Partnership Act. It is submitted that upon the demise of Nalin Merchant, the
trademark and goodwill was not to be taken into account and was not to be
treated as the assets of the said firm.
66\. Insofar as the issue of valuation is concerned, learned senior counsel
submits that all the accounts were to be signed by all the partners. The
accounts of the said firm were to be taken upto the date of demise of Nalin
Merchant. The claimants would be entitled to profit at the rate of 34% on the
balance amount payable from the date of death of Nalin Merchant till such
payment is made to the claimants. Said 34% in the profit is required to be
paid in view of the respondents using the share of the claimants
proportionately in the business of the said firm.
Dr.Tulzapurkar distinguished the judgments relied upon by Mr.Sancheti, learned
senior counsel for the respondents. He submits that the claimants have
disputed the accounts of respondent no.1 as on 31st October, 2009.
He submits that after the demise of the husband of claimant no.1 - Nalin
Merchant, respondent no.1 has shown huge loss in the account of the said firm
with a view to deprive the claimants of their legitimate share in the said
firm. The learned arbitrator has thus rightly issued a direction for having
the valuation on the basis of the market value. Dr.Tulzapurkar fairely submits
that the learned arbitrator should have also provided for ascertainment of
liabilities of the said firm before issuing any direction to the said firm to
pay the claimants according to the market value of the assets and the question
of wilful default at this stage did not arise.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 35 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
67\. Mr.Sancheti submits that the submission of the claimants that the award
as made by the learned arbitrator can be modified in view of the submission
now made by the claimants that the claimants would be entitled to payment on
the basis of valuation of assets minus liabilities itself is sufficient to set
aside the award. He submits that the new submission of the claims that no
willful default applies at this stage is also contrary to their prayers made
in the statement of claim.
REASONS AND CONCLUSIONS :-
68\. The claimants have impugned the portion i.e. paragraphs 22 to 27 and in
paragraph 33(b) of the impugned award in Arbitration Petition No.939 of 2012
i.e. Issuee No.III and view of the learned arbitrator that the respondent
no.1-firm and the continuing partners had a right to use the goodwill,
trademarks, trade names and labels during the continuance of the said firm.
The claimants have also challenged the award in so far as the learned
arbitrator had directed that the amount of royalty payable by the respondents
to the claimants will have to be worked out by the Chartered Accountant. The
claimants have also impugned the award in so far as the learned arbitrator has
refused to grant injunction against the respondents thereby refusing to
restrain the respondents from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale,
advertising or directly or indirectly dealing in any goods under the
trademarks or trade names or labels or any other trademarks, trade names
similar to the said trademarks or trade names or labels, so as to cause
confusion or deception or to pass off or enable others to pass off.

ppn 36 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
69\. In so far as the respondents herein are concerned, the respondents have
impugned the portion of the award dated 17 th April 2012 in so far as the
learned arbitrator had declared that the claimant no.1 was entitled to 50%
shares in the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels and holding that
the respondent no.1-firm and/or continuing partners were not proprietors of
the trademarks. The respondents have also challenged the portion of paragraph
33 (b) of the award in which the learned arbitrator had held that the
respondents shall pay some royalty to the claimant no.1 for use of her 50%
share. The amount of royalty payable shall be worked out by the Chartered
Accountant. The respondents have also impugned the declaration rendered by the
learned arbitrator that the claimant no.1 was entitled to share of deceased
Mr.Nalin Merchant in the respondent no.1-firm which share shall be worked out
on the basis of the market value of assets of the firm and that the
respondents jointly and severally shall render true and correct accounts on
the basis of willful default from the accounting year in which Mr.Nalin
Merchant died i.e. from 1st April 2009 till date and for payment of the amount
due to the claimants. The respondents have impugned the portion of the
directions issued in paragraph 33(d) of the award in which the learned
arbitrator had given an option to the claimant no.1 to elect to receive 34%
share in the profits or 6% p.a. interest on the amount of her share.
70\. In the impugned award, the learned arbitrator has dealt with issue nos.I
and II together as to whether Mr.Nalin Merchant had 50% shares in the
goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels and as to whether the respondents
are/were the proprietors of the trademarks  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015
00:00:36 ::: ppn 37 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc listed in Annexure A to the
statement of claim. I shall deal with the impugned award in so far as the
issue nos. I & II is concerned.
71\. It is not in dispute that Mr.Nalin Merchant was a partner in the
respondent no.1-firm and was having 34% shares in the said firm. The learned
arbitrator has rendered finding that inspite of prior registration and the
fact that the trademarks stood in the name of the firm, the partners had by
their agreement considered the trademarks to belong only to Mr. Nalin Merchant
and the respondent no.2. The learned arbitrator has also considered the Draft
Deed (Ex-GG) which was forwarded by the respondents to the claimant no.1. It
is held by the learned arbitrator that the respondent no.1-firm had paid
royalty and that the trademarks were allowed to be purchased by Mr. Nalin
Merchant and the respondent no.2 completely belies the case now sought to be
made up by the respondents. It is held that goodwill, trademarks, trade names
and labels did not belong to the respondent no.1-firm but to Mr. Nalin
Merchant and after his demise, to the claimant no.1 and the respondent no.2
who have 50% shares each.
72\. A perusal of the record indicates that it was the case of the claimants
before the learned arbitrator that under the Deed of Partnership dated 21st
November 1943, the right to use and ownership of the name, title, goodwill,
trademark etc. of the said firm vested in one Jevabai Khimjee who was the
mother of late Mr.Nalin Khimjee Merchant and late Mr. Ajit Khimjee Merchant.
The said Jevabai Khimjee died some time in the year 1983. By her last Will and
Testament dated 10th February 1982, the said Jevabai Khimjee had alleged to
have bequeathed her entire right, title and interest in the name, title,
goodwill, trademarks, etc.  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 38
arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc of the said firm equally to her sons Mr.Nalin
Khimjee Merchant and Mr.Ajit Khimjee Merchant. It was the case of the
claimants that Mr.Nalin Khimjee Merchant and Mr.Ajit Khimjee Merchant each
became entitled to 50% share in name, title, goodwill, trademarks etc. of the
respondent no.1-firm.
73\. In the Partnership Deeds executed between 7th October 1929 to 17th
February 1937, it was provided that when the said firm was dissolved due to
any reason, then Jevabai wife of Khimjee Laljee shall only have right to use
the name of the said firm. Mrs. Jevabai Khimjee retired from the said
partnership firm with effect from 29 th January 1982. On her retirement from
the said partnership firm, the partnership as it then existed was discontinued
and a new partnership came into existence. It was the case of the claimants
that the said Mrs. Jevabai Khimjee became exclusively and absolutely entitled
to use and ownership of the said assets. By a document dated 10 th March 1983,
the said Jevabai assigned her right, title and interest in the said assets to
Mrs.Kokilaben Ajitsingh Bhimani, Mr.Ajitsingh Khimjee Merchant, Mr.Nalin
K.Merchant and Mr.Ajitsingh Karsandas Bhimani in their capacity as trustees of
a private trust i.e. Laljee Godhoo Family Trust for valuable consideration.
74\. By an agreement dated 10th March 1983 executed between the said trustees
on the one hand and the said firm on the other hand, the trustees permitted
the firm to use the said assets on payment of royalty on the terms and
conditions set out therein. On 31 st March 2003, the said trust was revoked
and the ownership of the assets of the trust was transferred to the
beneficiaries i.e.Mrs.Veena N. Merchant and Mr.  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 39 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc Bimal A. Merchant
who absolutely became entitled to 50% share in the right, title and interest
in the said assets. It is the case of the claimants that by a document dated
17th April 2003, Mr.Bimal A. Merchant and claimant no.1 herein assigned all
their joint right, title and interest in the said assets to Mr.Nalin Merchant
and Mrs.Jyoti Merchant for consideration of Rs.15 lacs. It is the case of
claimants that during the period between 1982 and 2003, the said assets did
not belong to any of the partners of the partnership firm or to the respondent
no.1-firm but belong to the said trust.
75\. It was the case of the claimants that under clause 6 of the Partnership
Deed dated 14th June 2003, it was specifically provided that during the
subsistence of the partnership or on determination of partnership for any
reason whatsoever, the aforesaid assets viz., name, goodwill, trademarks,
labels etc. shall not be taken into account or in consideration when making up
the accounts of the partnership. These assets shall not be considered as
assets of the partnership. It was thus contended by the learned senior counsel
for the claimants that by virtue of provision of the said Partnership Deed, on
demise of the said Mr.Nalin Merchant, the claimant no.1 became entitled to his
50% share in the said assets i.e. in the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and
labels. It was urged by the learned senior counsel for the claimants that the
claimant no.1 being 50% owner thereof cannot be forced to permit the
respondents to use the said goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels etc.
either on license or otherwise. It was urged by the learned senior counsel
that since the claimant no.1 is having 50% share in those assets, the learned
arbitrator could not have directed the  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015
00:00:36 ::: ppn 40 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc claimant no.1 to create any
license in respect thereof in favour of the respondents on payment of royalty
or otherwise.
76\. It was also urged by the learned senior counsel for the claimants that
even if the respondents were registered as proprietors of the trademarks under
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 or any other provisions of law,
that would not create any title in favour of the respondents in the
trademarks. It was urged by the learned senior counsel that the learned
arbitrator could not have refused to grant injunction in favour of the
claimants and restraining the respondents from carrying on any business by use
of goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels etc. without consent of the
claimants.
77\. On the other hand, it was urged by the learned senior counsel for the
respondents that since 1949 onwards, the entries in the trademark register
would show that the name of all the partners had been entered into as
proprietors of the trademarks. As and when a fresh Deed of Partnership was
entered into, a fresh entry was made in the trademark register to record the
proprietors of the trademarks being the then partners of the firm. It is the
case of the respondents that the respondents were thus registered as
proprietors within the meaning of Section 2(v) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
The respondents have placed reliance on the definition of "registered
proprietor" under Section 2(v) and the definition of the trade mark under
section 2(zb), Section 6 and section 17 of the said Act. Reliance is also
placed on Sections 24, 28 and 37 to 40 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 41 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
78\. It is the case of the respondents that since partners had registered as
joint proprietors, the exclusive right to use the same shall not be deemed to
have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those
persons and each one has the same rights as against other persons. It is also
the case of the respondents that the trademark being an incorporeal property,
not being a movable or immovable property, has no existence independent of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 and could only be dealt with/transmitted strictly under
the provisions of law. To appreciate the rival submissions made by the learned
senior counsel for both the parties, it would be relevant to refer to some of
the relevant provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Rules framed
thereunder.
79\. A perusal of the record produced before the arbitral tribunal which was
high lighted by the respondents before this Court clearly indicates that since
1949 onwards, the document of registration of trademarks clearly shows that
the name of all the partners of the respondent no.1-firm had been entered into
as the proprietors of the trademarks. A fresh entry was made in the trademark
registry as and when fresh Deed of Partnership recording any change in the
constitution of the respondent no.1-firm was recorded between the parties.
According to such Deed of Partnership, fresh entries were recorded in the
trademark registry to record the proprietors of the trademarks, being the then
partners of the firm. The said practice was continued for all trademarks of
the Respondent No.1 firm irrespective of the fact that the said trademark was
assigned by one party to another for devolution of entries for some period of
time.

80\. Section 2(v) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines the term "registered
proprietor" as under:
> "2(v) registered proprietor" in relation to a trade mark, means the person
> for the time being entered in the register as propriety of the trade marks."
Section 2(zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines the term "trade mark" as
under:
> "(zb) "trade mark" means a mark capable of being represented graphically and
> which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from
> those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and
> combination of colours: and--
> (i) in relation to Chapter XII (other than section 107), a registered trade
> mark or a mark used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of

> proprietor or by way of permitted user, to use the mark whether with or
> without any indication of the identity of that person, and includes a
> certification trade mark or collective mark."
Section 6 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides for the Register of Trademarks
as under:
> "1. ....
> 2\. .....
> 3\. .....
> 4\. No notice of any trust, express or implied or constructive, shall be
> entered in the register and no such notice shall be receivable by the
> Registrar.
> 5\. ..."
Section 17(1)(vii) of the said Act provides for effect of the registration of
part of a mark as under:
> "(1) When a trade mark consists of several matters, its registration shall
> confer on the proprietor exclusive right to the use of the trade mark taken
> as a whole.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::

> question whatsoever of any license or permitted user under the said Act. It
> is further clear from section 6(4) of the said Act that there shall not be

Section 24 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides for jointly owned trademarks
which reads as under:
> "24. (1) Save as provided in sub-section (2), nothing in this Act shall
> authorise the registration of two or more persons who use a trade of.
> mark independently, or propose to use it, as joint proprietors there (2)

> those persons may be registered as joint proprietors of the trade mark, and
> this act shall have effect in relation to any right to the use of the trade
> mark vested in those persons as if those rights had been vested in a single
> person."
Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides for rights conferred by
registration. It provides as under:
> "28 (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a
> trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade
> mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the

> (2) The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under sub- section

(3) Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trademarks, which
are identical with or nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the
use of any of those trade marks shall not (except so far as their respective
rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register)
be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any
other of those persons merely by  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 44 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc registration of the trade marks but each of
those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons (not
being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he would have if he
were the sole registered proprietor."
Sections 37 to 39 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provide for assignment and
transmission of registered trademarks.
37\. The person for the time being entered in the register as proprietor of a
trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Act and to any rights
appearing from the register to be vested in any other person, have power to
assign the trade mark, and to give effectual receipts for any consideration
for such assignment
38\. Notwithstanding any thing in another law to the contrary a registered
trade mark shall, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, be assignable and
transmissible, whether with or without the goodwill of the business concerned
and in respect either of all the goods or services in respect of which the
trade mark is registered or of some only of those goods or services.
39\. An unregistered trade mark may be assigned or transmitted with or without
the goodwill of the business concerned."
Section 40(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides for restriction on
assignment or transmission where multiple exclusive rights would be created
which reads thus:
> "(1) Notwithstanding anything in section 38 and 39, a trade mark shall not

> (2) ......"
81\. A conjoint reading of Section 2(v) Section 2(zb), Section 6 and Section
17 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 makes it clear that the registered trademarks
indicates a connection in the course of trade between the goods and services,
as the case may be, and some person having the right as proprietor to use the
mark. Under Section 17 of the said Act, it is clearly provided that when a
trademark consists of several matters, its registration shall confer on the
proprietor exclusive right to the use of the trademark taken as a whole.
82\. It is not in dispute that the partners of Respondent No.1 firm and the
said firm had been using the trademarks for last more than 60 years. The
learned arbitrator has also given a finding to that effect in the impugned
award. The said Mr. Nalin Merchant who claimed 50% share in the trademarks was
admittedly a partner of the Respondent No.1 firm. Even after the demise of the
said Mr. Nalin Merchant, the Respondent No.2 continued to be a partner of the
Respondent No.1 firm and did not raise any objection in the firm and other
partners of the Respondent No.1 firm using the said trademarks. It is thus
clear beyond reasonable doubt that the said trademark in relation to the goods
or services was used in a connection with and in the course of trade between
the goods or services and the registered proprietors of the trademarks.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 46 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
83\. A perusal of Section 6(4) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 clearly provides
that there shall not be entered in the register any notice of a trust, express
or implied or constructive. A perusal of Section 24 of the said Act makes it
clear that the said provision does not permit registration as joint
proprietors where the intention was to use the trademarks independently or
stop the other persons from using it. When a party intends to use a trademark
jointly and on behalf of all of them and in relation to an article with which
all of them are connected, only and only then such person can be registered as
joint proprietor. In my view, the fact that the Respondents have been
registered as registered proprietors under the provisions of the Trade Marks
Act, 1999 for last several decades, it clearly indicates that all of them were
connected in the course of the trade jointly and only after satisfying the
said condition, the Authority had registered them as registered proprietors of
the trademarks.
84\. In my view, since the Respondents were registered as proprietors of the
trademarks, it gave them exclusive right to the use the trademarks in relation
to the goods or services in respect of which the trademark was registered, and
the Claimant No.1 who claims 50% ownership in the said trademarks who is not a
registered proprietor of the said trademarks cannot stop the registered
proprietors of the said trademarks from using it.
85\. A perusal of Section 28 of the said Act makes it clear that if several
persons are registered as joint proprietors, the exclusive right to use the
said trademarks shall not be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those
persons as against any other of those and each has the same  ::: Downloaded on
- 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 47 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc right as against
other persons. In my view, even the Respondents inter se cannot claim any
exclusive right against each other in the said trademarks in view of the
Respondents having been registered as joint proprietors of the said
trademarks. In my view, claim of the Claimant No.1 that the trademarks were
owned individually by Mr. Nalin Merchant and Ms. Jyoti Merchant to the
exclusion of the other registered proprietors is contrary to Sections 24 and
28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
86\. A conjoint reading of Sections 24, 28, 37 to 40 of the said Act makes it
clear that the registration or transmission as joint proprietors cannot be
permitted unless the parties had intended to use the trademark on behalf of
all. Section 40 of the said Act prohibits assignment or transmission which
would result in creation of rights in more than one person and result in
multiple exclusive users of the same trademark. In my view, if such a
transmission is permitted as canvassed by the learned senior counsel for the
Claimants, it would result in the trademark becoming vulnerable and making it
entirely unusable and worthless. Thus, in my view, if the Claimant No.1 is
declared as owner of the trademarks and the Respondents who are admittedly the
registered proprietors of the said trademarks are restrained from using it in
connection with the trade, the same would be contrary to Sections 6, 17, 24,
28, 37 to 40 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
87\. In so far as the reliance placed on the Clause 6 of the Partnership Deed
by the Claimant no.1 in support of her claim of 50% ownership in the trademark
is concerned, in my view, the finding of the learned arbitrator that the
Claimant No.1 is the owner of the trademarks  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015
00:00:36 ::: ppn 48 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc to the extent of 50% is
contrary to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 under which the
Respondents had been admittedly registered as registered proprietors of such
trademarks. The learned arbitrator, in my view, thus though rightly refused to
grant any injunction against the Respondents as prayed, he has completely
overlooked the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 while rendering a
finding that the Claimant No.1 was 50% owner of the said trademarks and thus
the award is in conflict with the public policy. In my view, till the firm was
dissolved, the claimant no.1 could not make any claim of ownership in the
trade mark.
88\. A perusal of the award indicates that the learned arbitrator has also
placed heavy reliance on the Draft Deed of Partnership which was signed by the
Respondents in which the Respondents had proposed that after the death of the
said Mr. Nalin Merchant, the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels
would personally belonged to Claimant No.1 and the Respondent No.2. The said
Draft Deed of Partnership was admittedly not executed and/or signed by the
Claimant No.1. In my view, no reliance thus could be placed on the said
unexecuted document relied by the claimants before the learned arbitrator. Be
that as it may, till the Respondents continue to be the registered proprietors
of the trademarks, no ownership in respect of the said trademarks contrary to
such registration of the Respondents as registered proprietors of the
trademarks could be granted by the learned arbitrator which would have the
effect of destroying of such trademarks.
89\. The Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Power Control Appliances & Others
(supra) has held that there can be only one mark,  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 49 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc one source and one
proprietor and cannot have two origins. It is held by the Supreme Court in the
said decision that the joint proprietors must use the trademarks jointly for
the benefit of all and it cannot be used in rivalry and in competition with
each other. Paragraphs 41 and 42 of the decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of M/s. Power Control Appliances & Others v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) read thus:
> "41. It is a settled principle of law relating to trade mark that there can

> No cost."
90\. The Madras High Court in the case of B.S.Ramappa & Another v. V.B.
Monappa & Another (supra) has held that there cannot be an honest concurrent
use by two separate persons of the same trademark. Paragraphs 12, 24, and 31
to 33 of the said judgment of the Madras High Court read thus:
> "12. Thereupon the father on 18th February, 1960 executed a rectification
> deed (pages 7 to 9 of the typed set in. L.P.A. No. 76 of 1964) stating that
> under the deed of 8th February, 1953 he had also conveyed to the younger son
> the three trade marks, one of them being the Taj Double Bavta Mark, and that
> he had not given the trade mark to anybody else.
24\. The second important point made by the learned Counsel is that on the
same reasoning indicated above, it has to be held that the adoption  :::
Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 50 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc of
the mark by Monoppa with only a slight variation from 17th January, 1950 could
not be said to be really honest. The learned Counsel emphasises that for the
use to be honest within the meaning of Section 12 (3) of the Act it is not
enough if Monappa believed that he had a right to use it and that it is
necessary that in law the belief must be sustainable. The law would not
however sustain such a belief because the adoption of the mark virtually
resembling the old mark was prohibited by Section 39 of the Act and when it
was prohibited by law, the law would not allow the usurper to say that the use
of the mark was honest. The learned Counsel submits that even apart prom law
it should be obvious that this is the position even to a layman.
31\. We have thus arrived at the conclusion that as a matter of construction,
there was no assignment of the trade mark to Monappa in the deed of 17th
January, 1950 and in any case the assignment would be totally invalid in view
of Sections 31 and 32 of Act V of 1940. This was the conclusion reached by the
Registrar and I affirm it.
32\. I now turn to the argument of Sri V. Rajagopalachari which I have already
indicated in full. I agree with him that even in order to entitle to
registration under Section 12 (3) on the ground of honest concurrent user or
other special circumstances it was necessary for Monappa to establish that he
was the proprietor of the trade mark sought to be registered. This contention
is fully supported by the wording of Section 12 (3) and Section 18 and the
principles underlying the trade mark law and the authorities cited by learned
Counsel. To hold otherwise would mean that if Monappa had no right to use the
trade mark, he could claim the right of registration on the alleged ground of
honest and concurrent use, a position which it is impossible to accept. It
seems to me, however, that both the aspects of the argument of Sri
Rajagopalachari, that Monappa could not claim to be the proprietor and that
the use was not honest, resolve themselves in the last resort only to one
criterion, namely, that Monappa, in view of the prohibition contained in
Sections 31 and 32 of the Act of 1940 could not claim to have honestly adopted
any mark which would virtually be a replica of the mark of the founder. Since
the point is important and seems to arise for the first time I shall endeavour
to elaborate this to some extent.
33\. Suppose for the sake of argument that Monappa in the first place, without
making any alteration whatever, had begun to use the trade mark of the founder
from 17th January, 1950. It is obvious that in such a case the user would not
be honest at all. Even if he claimed that right as a matter of construction of
the deed of 17th January, 1950 that claim would be invalid in view of Sections
31 and 32 of the Act of 1940. Hence he could not be considered to be the
proprietor of the mark for purposes of Section 12 (3) or Section 18 of the Act
of 1958 (the corresponding sections were Section 10 (2) and 14 of the Act of
1940). Obviously the different provisions of Act V of 1940 would have to be
construed in harmony. In other words Section 10 (2) and Section 14 of Act V of
1940 should be construed so as to harmonise with Sections 31 and 32 of that
Act and similarly Sections 12 (3) and 18 of the Act of 1958 should be
construed so as to be in harmony with  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36
::: ppn 51 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc Sections 39 and 40 of that Act. If
under the latter set of provisions the Court could not recognise a partial
assignment the Registrar and the Court would not recognise Monappa as the
proprietor of the trade mark. Evidently Monappa and his legal adviser were
conscious of this and that was why Monappa sought to vary the original mark of
the founder by adding the word ' Monappa's, on the top and transposing the
numeral ' 1596 ' from the bottom of the shield to a place inside the shield.
The idea of Monappa in making this variation was to contend that this
variation sufficiently distinguished his mark from the original mark of the
founder, so as to avoid the bar of Sections 31 and 32 of Act V of 1940. If
really the Court could say that the variation sufficiently distinguished the
mark of Monappa from the founder's mark, the Court would be justified in
saying that the use of the new trade mark of Monappa would not be likely to
deceive or cause confusion and therefore the bar of Sections 31 and 32 would
not apply and Monappa could legitimately be described as the inventor of the
new mark and could be considered as the proprietor of the new mark for the
purposes of Sections 10 (2) and 14 of Act V of 1940 (the corresponding
provisions in the Act of 1958 being Sections 12 (3) and 18). Further in such a
case the Court could also say that the use of the new mark substantially
different from the old mark, could be considered as honest within the meaning
of Section 10 (2) of Act V of 1940 and Section 12 (3) of Act XLIII of 1958."
In my view, the aforesaid two judgments clearly apply to the facts of this
case. I am respectfully bound by the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
of M/s. Power Control Appliances & Others (supra). I am in agreement with the
views expressed by the Madras High Court in the case of B.S.Ramappa and
Another (supra).
91\. In so far as the judgments of the Madras High Court in the case of T.I.
Muhammad Zumoon Sahib v. Fathimunnissa (supra), Hindustan Lever Ltd. V. Bombay
Soda Factory (supra), and Skol Breweries Ltd. V. Som Distilleries & Breweries
Ltd. (supra) relied upon by Mr. Sancheti, learned senior counsel for the
Claimants are concerned, in those judgments, the Courts have dealt with the
case of potential joint proprietorship of trademark or dispute amongst the
registered proprietors of a trademark. The facts in the aforesaid three
judgments relied upon by  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 52
arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc the learned senior counsel for the Claimants are
totally different and clearly distinguishable in the facts of this case. In
this case, the Claimant No.1 has claimed joint ownership to the extent of 50%
contrary to Sections 24 and 28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and to the
exclusion of other registered proprietors which is in the teeth of Sections 24
and 28 of the Trade Mark Act, 1999.
92\. In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Cycle
Corporation of India Ltd. V. T.I. Raleigh Industries Private Ltd. (supra) is
concerned, it is held by the Supreme Court that to get the trademark
registered without any intention to use it in relation to any goods but to
make money out of it by selling it to others, the right to use it as a
commodity would be trafficking in that trade mark and it is required to be
prevented and prohibited. It is also held that there must be real trade
connection between the proprietor of the trade and licensee of the goods. It
is not in dispute that the Respondents had offered to the Claimant No.1 34%
shares in the Partnership after demise of Mr. Nalin Merchant and by virtue of
which the Claimant No.1 also could have jointly use the said trademark after
her name would have been registered as the registered proprietor along with
others. The Claimant No.1 did not agree with the said decision.
93\. It is clear that the Respondent No.2 who continues to be a Partner of the
Respondent No.1 firm has no objection if all the Respondents are allowed to
continue to use the said trademarks. In my view, a person who claims some
shares in the trademarks and is not registered as registered proprietor under
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, cannot be allowed to raise any
claim contrary to the  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 53
arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc claim of registered proprietors which would breach
the rights of the registered proprietors under the said Act. There cannot be
rival claims claiming exclusive rights in the trademarks when such trademarks
are registered in the name of various persons jointly with an intention to use
of such trademark jointly by all of such proprietors and not by claiming by
any individual rights therein. In my view, the judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of Cycle Corporation of India Limited (Supra) thus would assist
the Respondents and not the Claimants. Paragraph 11 of the said judgment reads
thus:
> "11.
> The High Court recorded a finding and it is not disputed across the bar,

95\. In so far as the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Arjun
Kanoji Tankar vs. Shantaram Kanoji Tankar (supra) and the judgment of Nagpur
High Court in the case of Jamnadas vs. Ramadhar and Ors. (supra) relied upon
by Dr. Tulzapurkar is concerned, in my view, Mr.Sancheti, learned senior
counsel for the Respondents is right in his submission that in the context of
joint ownership of the trademarks under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act,
1999 even an agreement amongst the partners would not prevail over express
provision of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and there can not be a recommendation
and joint ownership in the teeth of the provisions of Section 40. Trade mark
being incorporeal property not being movable or immovable property has no
existence independent of the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
In my view, in case of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999 and the agreement between the parties, provisions of the Trade
Marks Act would prevail. In my view, agreement between the parties cannot be
dehors the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The aforesaid two
judgments relied upon by Dr. Tulzapurkar does not assist the case of the
Claimants and are clearly distinguishable.
96\. In my view, the finding of the learned arbitrator that the trade marks do
not belong to the Respondent No.1 firm but do belong to Mr. Nalin Merchant and
Respondent No.2 and they have 50% share each in the trademarks, is perverse
and contrary to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 56 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
97\. I shall now deal with the Issue No.III i.e. "Whether the name, goodwill
or trademarks and labels are to be valued only upon determination/closure of
the Respondent No.1 firm, as alleged in paragraph 7 of the written statement."
A perusal of the award indicates that the learned arbitrator has rendered a
finding that for the last over 60 years, the firm has used the goodwill,
trademarks, trade names and labels without any break. The claimants were thus
now estopped from saying the firm could not use such assets. It is held that
even after Mr. Nalin Merchant and the Respondent No.2 purchased the goodwill,
trademarks, trade names and labels for the sum of Rs.15 lacs, the firm
continued to use those assets, now without payment of any royalty. The learned
arbitrator has also considered the fact that the Respondent No.2 who had 50%
owner did not raise any objection that the Respondent No.1 firm could not use
those assets. It is held by the learned arbitrator that so long the firm has
the right to use the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels, the same
could not be allowed to be taken away by a person who was not a partner and,
therefore, the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels could only be
valued at the time of dissolution of the firm.
Though the learned arbitrator rendered finding that the claimants could not be
allowed to take away the right of the firm to use the goodwill, trademarks,
trade names and labels, the learned arbitrator also rendered finding that the
said users to the extent of 50% share of the Claimant No.1 could not use
without any payment or compensating her for it. The learned arbitrator
accordingly directed that the royalty amount shall be determined by the
Chartered Accountant.
98\. As far as the issue No.III is concerned, it is a common ground that both
the parties have challenged this part of the award. The  ::: Downloaded on -
07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 57 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc Claimants have
challenged this part of the award on the ground that the Claimant No.1 being
the owner to the extent of 50%, the Claimant No.1 could not be directed by the
learned arbitrator to permit license in favour of the Respondents though the
Claimants did not wish to grant any license/permission in favour of the
Respondents. On the other hand, the Respondents have challenged this part of
the award contending that the Respondents being the registered proprietors of
the trademarks were as a matter of right, entitled to use such trademarks
under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and did not require any
license from the Claimants or otherwise. Both the parties have also challenge
the direction of the learned arbitrator to determine the royalty by a
Chartered Accountant.
99\. In my view, since the Respondents are the registered proprietors of the
trademarks under the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and by virtue of
such registration are exclusively entitled to use of the said trademarks
jointly, no license is required by the Respondents to use such trademarks
which is permitted under the said Act. In so far as the claim of the Claimants
to the extent of 50% ownership in the goodwill, trademarks, trade names and
labels is concerned, the said claim would arise only at the stage of
determination of the firm and value thereof can be ascertained only at that
stage. Be that as it may, as it is a common ground that the learned arbitrator
could not have passed any order for creation of any license in favour of the
Respondents on payment of royalty by the Chartered Accountant or otherwise, I
am inclined to set aside that part of the award on that ground also. In my
view, whether the Claimant No.1 was the owner or not of the trade mark, the
learned arbitrator could not have passed an order for creation of  :::
Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 58 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
license in favour of the Respondents or could not have left in any event the
issue of determination of the royalty payable, if any, by virtue of such
license in favour of the Respondents by a Chartered Accountant. This part of
the award even otherwise, in my view is contrary to the provisions of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999, perverse and shows patent illegality.
100\. In so far as the Issue No.IV i.e. "Whether on Nalin Merchant's demise
his 34 % share in the firm, includes share in the assets of the firm and if
so, whether for the purpose of ascertaining the amount payable to the estate
of Nalin Merchant towards his 34 % share, the market value of the net assets
of the firm is required to be ascertained, as alleged in paragraph 47 of the
statement of claim" is concerned, the learned arbitrator has referred to
Clauses 16, 17 and 19 of the Partnership Deed and has held that the market
value of the assets of the firm will have to be ascertained and 34% shares of
Mr. Nalin Merchant in the firm would be at the market value. The learned
arbitrator in the impugned award accordingly has declared that the Claimant
No.1 is entitled to share of the deceased Mr. Nalin Merchant in the Respondent
No.1 firm which shall be worked out on the market value of the assets. The
learned arbitrator has directed the Respondents jointly and severally to
render true accounts on the basis of willful default for the accounting year
in which Mr. Nalin Merchant died i.e. from 1 st April 2009 till date and to
pay the balance amount after deducting a sum of Rs.3,76,70,305/- , if any,
found due to the Claimant No.1. The learned arbitrator has also given an
option to the Claimant No.1 to elect to receive 34% share in the profits or 6%
p.a. interest on the amount of her share.
::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 :::
ppn 59 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
101\. It is not in dispute that on the date of death of Mr. Nalin Merchant who
was having 34% share in the firm and even thereafter, the Deed of Partnership
dated 14th June 2003 continues to be in existence.
Under Clause 6 of the said Partnership Deed, it was agreed that during the
subsistence of the partnership or on determination of partnership for any
reason whatsoever, the aforesaid assets viz., name, goodwill, trademarks,
labels etc. shall not be taken into account or in consideration when making up
the accounts of the partnership. These assets shall not be considered as
assets of the partnership. Under Clause 17 of the said Partnership Deed, it
was provided that the death or retirement or adjudication as insolvent of any
partner shall not dissolve the partnership and the remaining partners shall be
entitled to continue the said business and may continue the same. The heirs
and legal representatives of the such deceased partner shall have merely the
right to receive the amount if any which and the share in profits, if any,
upto the date of his/her demise, unless the other remaining partners shall
agree to the heirs and legal representatives being taken up as partner(s) in
the partnership in the place of such deceased partner.
102\. Clause 18 of the said Partnership Deed provides that upon the
determination of the partnership for any reason whatsoever a full and general
account shall be taken of the assets (excluding the assets which are mentioned
in clause 6 hereof) credits, debts and liabilities of the partnership and of
the transactions and dealings thereof. Clause 19 of the Partnership Deed
provides that upon the retirement or removal of any partner from the
partnership a full and general account shall be taken of the assets, credits,
debts and liabilities of the partnership but excluding the assets in Clause 6.
It is not in dispute that the Respondents  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015
00:00:36 ::: ppn 60 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc had offered partnership to the
Claimant No.1 in place of her deceased husband and offered 34% share in the
firm but the Claimant No.1 did not accept the said proposal.
103\. It is not in dispute that the Respondent No.1 firm would not be
dissolved even in case of demise of any partner and it would continue.
The said Mr. Nalin Merchant had not retired from the said partnership but he
expired. In my view, the claim of the Claimants thus would be governed by
clause 17 of the Partnership Deed and the Claimants being the heirs and legal
representatives of the said deceased Mr. Nalin Merchant shall have merely the
right to receive the amount, if any, which and the share in profit, if any,
upto the date of demise of the said Mr. Nalin Merchant. It is not in dispute
that the amount of Rs.3,76,70,305/- which was due and payable according to the
Respondents to the estate of late Shri Nalin Merchant as of date of his death
has already been paid by the Respondents to the Claimants. According to the
Respondents, the said amount was actually due at the foot of the account of
the said Mr. Nalin Merchant on the date of his death i.e. 1 st April 2009.
Even if clause 6 is considered as not contrary to the provisions of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999, even according to the said clause, during the subsistence of
the firm name, goodwill, trademarks, labels etc. of the firm shall not be
taken into account or consideration when accounts of the firm are made up. It
is not in dispute that the firm subsists and is not determined. Clause 6 has
to be read with clause 17, 18 and 19.
104\. A perusal of the award further indicates that the learned arbitrator has
directed the Respondents to work out the share of the said deceased on the
basis of the market value of the assets of the firm on the  ::: Downloaded on
- 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 61 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc death of Mr.
Nalin Merchant. A perusal of the Clauses 18 and 19 of the Partnership Deed
indicates that the firm was under an obligation to prepare a full and general
account of the assets only upon determination of the partnership or upon
retirement or upon removal of any partners from the Partnership and as the
case may be and not when any existing partner had expired. A perusal of the
award indicates that the learned arbitrator has issued such direction based on
the equity and overlooking the Partnership Deed which was an agreement between
all the partners which was not only binding upon the said Mr. Nalin Merchant
during his lifetime but also upon his legal heirs upon his demise including
the provisions regarding the valuation of the assets of the deceased partner
in the firm. The learned arbitrator, in my view, has applied the provisions of
Clauses 18 and 19 while issuing such direction of valuing the assets of the
firm at the market value which were not applicable in case of demise of a
partner and where the firm is allowed to continue the business. In my view,
this part of the award is contrary to the agreement entered into between the
parties and shows patent illegality and is in conflict with the public policy.
105\. The learned arbitrator while issuing a direction that the assets of the
Respondent No.1 firm has to be valued at the market value from the date of
death of Mr. Nalin Merchant, did not give any direction to determine the
liability of the Respondent No.1 firm also on the date of his death to arrive
at the net amount payable to the claimants. In my view, the learned arbitrator
could not have applied only part of Section 48 of the Partnership Act event if
the same could be applied. Dr. Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel for the
Claimants fairly conceded that the learned arbitrator could not have directed
to take the valuation only of  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn
62 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc the assets for the purpose of determination of
the share of the said Mr. Nalin Merchant at the time of his death but even the
liability of the firm coming to his share ought to have been ascertained by
the learned arbitrator in the impugned award.
106\. In so far as the direction of the learned arbitrator to make up the
account of the firm on the willful default basis is concerned, Dr.
Tulzapurkar, learned senior counsel for the Claimants fairly conceded that
even such direction issued by the learned arbitrator was not required at this
stage. Be that as it may, the learned arbitrator has already rejected the
evidence of Mr. Chandrahas Dayal who was examined as the witness by the
Claimants on the issue of valuation of the assets, who had admitted that for
the liquidation value, the market value of all assets would be relevant. The
learned arbitrator has held that the valuation suggested by Mr. Chandrahas
Dayal could not be accepted as the witness did not appear to be an unbiased
professional. The witness examined by the Claimants himself has admitted that
the valuation was not correct and that the claimants themselves considered
that extraneous. The deposition of the said witness was unsatisfactory.
107\. It was the case of the Respondents before the learned arbitrator on this
issue that the Chartered Accountant appointed by the Claimants was offered
inspection of books of account for last 3-4 years including details of the
valuation of the immovable properties as disclosed in the balance sheet on a
year to year basis. The said witness also admitted in his cross-examination
that there was no valuation at the market price and/or there was no re-
valuation of the assets in the books of accounts of the Respondent No.1 firm
for the Financial Years 2005-2006,  ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36
::: ppn 63 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc 2006-2007, 2007-2008. In my view, the
learned arbitrator has totally overlooked this crucial part of the evidence
and has issued a direction contrary thereto that the valuation of the assets
shall be taken on the basis of the market value at the date of death of Mr.
Nalin Merchant.
108\. It was also the case of the Respondents that the said Mr. Nalin Merchant
had already accepted the account of the Respondent No.1 firm as on 31st March
2009. The learned arbitrator has also accepted the accounts of the firm as on
31st March 2009 and did not give any direction that the accounts or valuation
of the assets of the firm prior to 31 st March 2009 shall be re-opened.
109\. In my view, the direction of the learned arbitrator to take the
valuation of the assets on the basis of market value is contrary to the Clause
17 of the Partnership Deed. Under Clause 17 of the Partnership Deed, the
partnership firm has to carry on business even in case of demise of any
partner. The legal heirs and representatives of deceased partner are entitled
to receive the amount, if any, which and the share in profits, if any, upto
the date of demise of such partner, unless the other remaining partners shall
agree to the heirs and legal representatives being taken up as partners.
Admittedly, the claimant no.1 has refused to become a partner though offered
by the respondents. In my view, the valuation of the assets of the partnership
firm on the basis of market value or general account of the firm could be
taken only upon the determination of the partnership or in case of retirement
or removal of any partner and not when a partner expired.

ppn 64 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc
110\. In so far as the the account for the period between 1 st April 2009 till
the date of death of said Mr.Nalin Merchant is concerned, It is the case of
the respondents that the respondents have ascertained the true and correct
amount payable to the estate of deceased of the said partner as on the date of
his death and his share was not used by the partnership firm or witness of the
firm. On the other hand, it was the case of the claimants that after demise of
the said Mr.Nalin Merchant, the respondents were deliberately showing the
losses in the account of the suit firm and the same was not acceptable to the
claimants. In my view, in this situation, the learned arbitrator ought to have
given a positive finding as to whether the accounts already made up by the
respondent no.1-firm as on the date of death of the said Mr.Nalin Merchant was
true and correct, whether any part of the share of the said deceased partner
was continued to be used by the partnership firm in carrying on business after
the death of deceased partner. The learned arbitrator, however, has not
rendered any such finding on this issue. In my view, Dr.Tulzapurkar, learned
senior counsel for the claimants is right in his submission that the accounts
of the suit firm with effect from 1 st April 2009 till date of the death of
the said deceased Mr.Nalin Merchant are to be made up for the purpose of
ascertaining the fact as to whether the amount of Rs.3,76,30,305/- paid by the
respondents to the claimant no.1 is proper or not.
111\. In my view, since both the parties have agreed that the learned
arbitrator could not have given direction to make up the accounts on the basis
of willful default, the said part of the impugned award is set aside. Since
this Court has taken a view that the learned arbitrator could  ::: Downloaded
on - 07/05/2015 00:00:36 ::: ppn 65 arbp-939.12 & 791.12(j).doc not have
directed the respondents to make up the accounts on the basis of the market
value of the assets and since it is a common ground that the learned
arbitrator ought to have also considered the liabilities of the suit firm as
on the date of death of the said deceased Mr.Nalin Merchant, that part of the
award is also set aside.
112\. In my view, on conjoint reading of clauses 6, 17, 18 and 19 of the
Partnership Deed, the claimants would have been entitled to valuation of the
goodwill, trademarks, trade names and labels on market value basis and would
be entitled to 50% share therein only when the respondent no.1-firm would be
dissolved and not prior thereto.
113\. In so far as the direction of the learned arbitrator giving an option to
the claimant no.1 either to elect to receive 34% share in the profit or 6%
p.a. interest is contrary to clause 17 of the Partnership Deed and is
accordingly set aside.
114\. I, therefore, pass the following order :-
a) Declaration of the learned arbitrator that the respondent no.1-firm and/or
the continuing partners are not the registered proprietors under the
provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is set aside;
b) Claimant no.1 is not entitled to 50% share in the goodwill, trademarks,
trade names and labels and value thereof till the respondent no.1-firm is
dissolved;
c) Direction of the learned arbitrator that the respondents shall pay the
royalty to the claimant no.1 and that such royalty shall be worked out by the
Chartered Accountant is set aside;

is set aside ;
g) The claimants would be entitled to determination of the accounts of the
