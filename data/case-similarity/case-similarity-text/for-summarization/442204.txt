duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured
in India" means the excise duty for the time being in force which would be

where such duty is leviable at different rates, the highest duty.

any imported article, where such duty is leviable at any percentage of its
value, the value of the imported article shall, notwithstanding anything

aggregate of-
(i) the value of the imported article determined under sub- section (1) of the
said section 14 or the tariff value of such article fixed under sub- section
(2) of that section, as the case may be; and
(ii) any duty of customs chargeable on that article under section 12 of the

any law for the time being in force as an addition to, and in the same manner
as, a duty of customs, but not including the duty referred to in sub- section

(3) If the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary in the public
interest to levy on any imported article[ whether on such article duty is
leviable under sub- section (1) or not] such additional duty as would counter-
balance the excise duty leviable on any raw materials, components and
ingredients of the same nature as, or similar to those, used in the production
or manufacture of such article, it may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, direct that such imported article shall, in addition, be liable to an
additional duty representing such portion of the excise duty leviable on such
raw materials, components
