                                           ORDER
Per Shri Chandra Poojari, Accountant Member This appeal by assessee is
directed against the assessment order passed u/s. 143(3) r.w.s. 144C of IT Act
dated 30.12.2014 in consequence to DRP order passed u/s. 144C(5) of the Act
dated 17.11.2014.
2\. The assessee raised the following grounds.
> "I. Transfer Pricing
> 1\. The learned Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (Transfer Pricing- IV),
> Bangalore ("Transfer Pricing Officer" or "learned TPO") grossly erred in
> determining an adjustment u/s 92CA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 to the Arm's
> Length Price ('ALP') of the international transaction entered into by the
> Appellant with its Associated Enterprises ("AEs") with respect to the
> Information Technology Enabled services ("ITeS").
> IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 2 of 10
2\. The Appellant aggrieved by the TPO Order further appealed before the
Dispute Resolution Panel ("DRP") against the TPO order and subsequently, the
learned Assessing Officer ("learned AO") issued the final assessment order
with a transfer pricing ("TP") adjustment of INR 30,281,283/-
3\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in rejecting the TP documentation
maintained by the Appellant by invoking provisions of sub-section (3) of 92C
of the Act contending that the information or data used in the computation of
the ALP is not reliable or correct. The learned AO/ learned TPO has grossly
erred therefore in :
3.a rejecting comparability analysis carried in the TP documentation and in
conducting a fresh comparability analysis by introducing various filters in
determining the ALP.
3.b rejecting companies that are functionally comparable to the Appellant
while performing the comparability analysis. Specifically, the following
companies ought to have been included as comparable: • Nittany Outsourcing
Services Private Limited • Datamatics Financial Services Limited • R Systems
International Limited • Caliber Point Business Solutions Limited • Ultramarine
& Pigments Limited • Jindal Intellicom Private Limited
3.c including companies that do not satisfy the test of comparability.
Specifically, the following companies selected as functionally comparable by
the learned AO / learned TPO ought to have been rejected:
• Accentia Technologies Limited • Fortune Infotech Limited • Jeevan Scientific
Technology Limited
4\. The learned AO / learned TPO has erred in application of employee cost
filter of 25% by selecting Jeevan Scientific Technology Limited, which has an
employee cost to sales ratio of 20.67%.
5\. The learned AO / learned DRP erred in applying export earning filter of
75% instead of 25%.
6\. The learned AO / learned DRP erred in rejecting ICRA Online Limited, a
company functionally not comparable, by applying export earning filter.
7\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in not considering the multiple year /
prior year financial data of comparable companies while determining the ALP.
IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 3 of 10
8\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in application of different financial
year ending filter.
9\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in using data as at the time of
assessment proceedings, instead of that available as on the date of preparing
the TP documentation for comparable companies while determining ALP.
10\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in not considering the provision for
bad and doubtful debts as operating in nature.
11\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in computation of working capital
adjustment.
12\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in ignoring the limited risk nature of
the contractual services provided by the Appellant and in not providing an
appropriate adjustment towards the risk differential, even when the full-
fledged entrepreneurial companies are selected as comparable companies.
II. Corporate Tax
1\. Interest under Section 234B of the Act The learned AO erred in levying
interest under section 234B of the Act amounting to INR 4,726,839/- The levy
of interest under section 234B of the Act is consequential in nature.
2\. Interest under Section 234D of the Act The learned AO erred in levying an
additional interest under section 234D of the Act amounting to INR 165,275/-.
The levy of interest under section 234D of the Act is consequential in nature.
The appellant craves leave to add, alter, rescind and modify the grounds
provided herein above or produce further documents, facts and evidence before
or during the course of hearing of this appeal.
For the above and any other grounds which may be raised at the time of
hearing, it is prayed that necessary relief may be provided."
3\. At the time of hearing, assessee not pressed ground nos. 1, 2, 3, 3(a), 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11 & 12\. The ld. AR pressed only ground related to the
comparables in 3(b) with reference to R Systems International Limited. Other
five comparables viz., Nittany Outsourcing Services Pvt. Ltd., Datamatics
Financial Services Ltd., Caliber Point Business Solutions Ltd., Ultramarine &
Pigments Ltd. and Jindal Intellicom Pvt. Ltd. are not pressed.
IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 4 of 10
4\. The first ground for consideration in this appeal is with regard to
considering R Systems International Ltd. as comparable.
5\. The assessee has selected in the transfer pricing documentation R Systems
International Ltd. as a comparable company since it is functionally comparable
and passing all the filters applied by the assessee in the TP documentation.
However the lower authorities rejected that company on the basis that it has
different year ending. Against this assessee is in appeal before us. The ld.
AR submitted that R Systems International Ltd. accounting period is January to
December and assessee's accounting period is April to March, therefore that
the assessee and R Systems International Ltd. were operating for a period of
12 months accounting cycle. Since they were facing similar business cycles,
market and economic conditions, it is not possible to say that because of
different accounting period it had any impact on its financials and resulted
into distortion of comparability. Since use of different accounting period
have no effect on the comparability parameters as mentioned in Rule 10B(2) of
the IT Rules 1962, therefore it would be inappropriate to reject R Systems
International Ltd. which is functionally comparable company only on the reason
that it has different accounting period. He relied on the judgement of Hon'ble
Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Mercer Consulting (India)
Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No. 101 of 2015(O&M) dated 24.08.2016 wherein Hon'ble High
Court held that "the Rule 10(B)(4) does not exclude from consideration the
data of an entity merely because its financial year is different from the
financial year of the assessee. What the Rule requires is that the data to be
used in analyzing the financial results of an uncontrolled transaction with an
international transaction shall be the data relating to the financial year in
which the international transaction has been entered into. Thus, so long as
the data relating to the financial year is available, it matters not, if the
financial year followed is different. In the case before us the data relating
to the relevant financial year of R.Systems International Limited is
available. We are, therefore, entirely in agreement with the decision of the
Tribunal that if the data relating to the financial year in which the
international transaction has been entered into is directly available from
IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 5 of 10 the annual accounts of that
comparable, then it cannot be held as not passing the test of sub-rule(4) of
rule 10B."
6\. On the other hand the ld. DR submitted that the accounting period of
assessee and R Systems International Ltd. are different and hence the lower
authorities have not considered R Systems International Ltd. as comparable.
The same to be upheld. For this purpose she relied on the decision of Pune
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Schlumberger India Technology Centre (P.)
Ltd. Vs. DDIT in ITA No. 640 (PUN.) of 2014 dated 10.01.2018 wherein held in
para 21 as follows.
> "21. Now, coming to the concern Jindal Intellicom Pvt. Ltd. The case of
> assessee before us is that the said concern has different financial year
> than the one of assessee. The Assessing Officer had applied the current year
> data as contemporaneous data to be used for benchmarking the arm's length
> price of international transactions of assessee. The assessee had prepared
> its financial statements for the financial year starting from 1st April,
> 2009 to 31st March, 2010. The case of assessee before us is that Jindal
> Intellicom Pvt. Ltd. has prepared its financial statements for period of 15
> months and the same is not to be selected in the final set of comparables.
> 22\. We find that the Pune Bench of Tribunal in the case of BMC Software
> India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in ITA No.1425/PN/2010, relating to assessment year
> 2006-07, order dated 16.03.2016 had rejected the concern having 15 months
> financials.
> 23\. The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT Vs. PTC Software (I)
> Pvt. Ltd. in Income Tax Appeal No.732 of 2014 had also held that the
> comparable data should pertain to the same financial year. Accordingly, we
> hold that the margins of concern having different accounting period cannot
> be selected for benchmarking international transactions and the same is to
> be excluded from the final set of comparables. Accordingly, we direct the
> Assessing Officer to exclude Jindal Intellicom Pvt. Ltd."
7\. We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. As
rightly pointed out by the ld. AR, Rule 10(B)(4) does not exclude from
consideration the data of an entity merely because its financial year is
different from the financial year of the assessee. What the Rule requires is
that the data to be used in analyzing the financial results of an uncontrolled
transaction with an international transaction shall be the data relating to
the financial year in which the IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 6 of 10
international transaction has been entered into. Thus so long as the data
relating to the financial year is available, it matters not, if the financial
year followed is different. In the case before us the data relating to the
relevant financial year of R.Systems International Limited is available. We
are, therefore, entirely in agreement with the decision relied by ld. AR that
if the data relating to the financial year in which the international
transaction has been entered into is directly available from the annual
accounts of that comparable, then it cannot be held as not passing the test of
sub-rule(4) of rule 10B and the same is the view taken by Hon'ble Punjab &
Haryana High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Mercer Consulting (India) Pvt. Ltd.
(supra). Being so, in our opinion data relating to the assessee financial year
to be interpolated and thereafter if required, it should be considered as a
comparable to the assessee's case. With this observation we remit this issue
to the file of TPO for his fresh consideration.
8\. The next ground of appeal is with regard to exclusion of Accentia
Technologies Limited as comparable. The ld. AR submitted that • Accentia is
engaged in rendering IT enabled services in the fields of medical
transcription, billing and coding. Further it is evident from the website of
the company, that the company develops its own software products for Business
Process Outsourcing. Furthermore, Accentia is the first company to offer
Software as Service model in the Healthcare Receivables Management area.
However, the company has not provided any segmental data. Hence, the Company
cannot be considered comparable to the assessee.
• Accentia possesses brand value/ IPRs as reflected in the Financial
Statements, which will tend to influence the pricing policy and thereby
directly impacting the margins earned.
• Accentia has acquired the IQ Group of companies of United Kingdom consisting
of three companies, Tactiq Ltd., Centric Ltd. and Neologiq Ltd and also
amalgamated Ascent Infoserve. Owing to these extra ordinary events, Accentia
should not be considered comparable to the assessee.
Further, the IQ Group of companies are engaged in Full Product IT(TP)A No.
221/Bang/2015  Page 7 of 10 Development Lifecycle involving Electronic Design
and development, Software Design and Development and separate validation
service, and User Interface Design and Implementation and Product Development
Consultancy and Troubleshooting involving Systematic Technology Consultation
software product design and development services.
• The assessee also provided the workings highlighting the abnormal
fluctuations in revenues and profits of Accentia for a 5 year period.
9\. He submitted that the assessee does not agree to the acceptance of
Accentia as a comparable company since it not only provides ITES but it is
also into software products development and provides software as service.
Also, the learned TPO in order to suit his own requirements and needs has
accepted Accentia as a comparable.
9.1 The ld. DR submitted that as per its Annual Report the assessee's
operation includes medical transcription, medical coding, billing and
receivable management (collection) all are integral part of the health care
BPO services termed as HRCM Services. In regard to revenue recognition, the
objection cannot be upheld in view of the financial reporting narrated in
annual report wherein it was mentioned that company shall prepare and maintain
its accounts fairly and accurately in accordance with the accounting and the
financial reporting Question of segmental information does not arise as per
the annual report, the company has only one segment.
10\. We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. The
main contention of ld. AR is this Accentia Technologies Ltd. is functionally
not comparable to assessee, which is a BPO. The segmental data relevant to
software services and product ITES are not available in the annual report.
That company own intangibles. These facts were considered in the case of the
coordinate bench in the case of Outsource Partners International Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
DCIT in IT(TP)A No. 337/Bang/2015 dated 06.02.2017 and held that it cannot be
a comparable case as in the case of assessee. Being so, we uphold the argument
of ld. AR and direct the TPO to exclude the above comparable.
IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015  Page 8 of 10
11\. The next ground of the appeal of the assessee is with regard to exclude
Fortune Infotech Limited as comparable. The ld. AR submitted that that company
uses web based software, unique technology and technical knowhow imported from
its business partners for providing BPO services. He relied on the decision of
coordinate bench of the Tribunal in the case of Outsource Partners
International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra).
11.1 On the other hand, ld. DR submitted that on examination of the annual
report of Fortune Infotech Ltd., it was noticed that there is no mention in
the annual report about the import of the unique technology and technical
knowhow from the business partners. Even otherwise, every company is required
to use the software and technology for providing ITEs services and therefore,
above company is to be considered as comparable to the assessee's case. The
ld. DR relied on the directions of DRP.
12\. We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. As
discussed in earlier year this comparable Fortune Infotech Ltd. was rejected
as a comparable in the case of Outsource Partners International Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
DCIT (supra) and it was held that it cannot be a comparable. Accordingly, we
direct the AO/TPO to exclude the same.
13\. The next ground is with regard to exclusion of Jeevan Scientific
Technology Limited in ground no. 3(c). This ground does not require any
adjudication in view of our findings with regard to issue raised in additional
ground.
14\. The assessee has raised additional ground and submitted the reason for
raising an additional ground as follows.
> "Ground No. 4A: Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to
> as "Jeevan Scientific") should be rejected as it fails service income filter
> of 75% as applied by the Ld. TPO.
> The Appellant submits that income form ITES activities for Jeevan Scientific
> is less than 75% of the total operating income and therefore Jeevan
> Scientific does not qualify the service income filter as applied by the TPO
> and therefore is not comparable to the Appellant.
> Reason for filing Additional Ground of Appeal IT(TP)A No. 221/Bang/2015
> Page 9 of 10 The Appellant in the Form 36B has taken a generic ground for
> rejection of Jeevan Scientific on comparability and employee cost filter.
> However, in order to bring out a more specific argument for exclusion of
> Jeevan Scientific we would like to bring to your kind attention that Jeevan
> Scientific fails the service income filter applied by the TPO himself and
> therefore cannot be comparable to the Appellant. On the above basis, we
> humbly request the Hon'ble Bench members to reject the above-mentioned
> company from the final set of comparable.
> Ground No. 5A: DRP has on its own modified the filter i.e., export earning
> filter The Appellant submits that the Appellant and the Ld. TPO has
> unilaterally applied 25% export earning filter but the DRP has on its own
> applied export earning filter of 75% and rejected the company which were not
> disputed either by the Appellant or by the Department before the DRP."
15\. The ld. AR submitted that admittedly the assessee raised that in ground
no.
3 for exclusion of Jeevan Scientific Technology Limited and also in ground no.
5 with regard to applying export earning filter of 75% instead of 25%. However
assessee has raised additional ground for exclusion of Jeevan Scientific
Technology Limited on the basis that income from ITES activities of Jeevan
Scientific Technology Ltd. is less than 75% of the total income and therefore
Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd. does not qualify the service income treated
as applied by the TPO. Hence it is to be excluded as comparable to the
assessee's case. In our opinion this is not additional ground but only
modified ground so as to facilitate proper adjudication of the issue. Hence,
we are inclined to admit this ground in the interest of justice.
16\. The ld. AR submitted that Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd. cannot be
considered as comparable to the assessee's case as it fails service income
filter of 75% as applied by the TPO. It is also submitted that DRP has itself
excluded ICRA Online Ltd. as comparable but the fact that 75% of export
earning filter needs to be applied as against 25% of export earning filter
applied by the TPO. Therefore in our opinion these facts required to be
examined by the TPO and if it is so ICRA Online Ltd. was excluded as
comparable, this comparable is also to be excluded on the same basis.
Accordingly, this issue is remitted to TPO for fresh consideration with this
observation.

2\. The Appellant aggrieved by the TPO Order further appealed before the
Dispute Resolution Panel ("DRP") against the TPO order and subsequently, the
learned Assessing Officer ("learned AO") issued the final assessment order
with a transfer pricing ("TP") adjustment of INR 30,281,283/-
3\. The learned AO / learned TPO erred in rejecting the TP documentation
maintained by the Appellant by invoking provisions of sub-section (3) of 92C
of the Act contending that the information or data used in the computation of
the ALP is not reliable or correct. The learned AO/ learned TPO has grossly
erred therefore in :
3.a rejecting comparability analysis carried in the TP documentation and in
conducting a fresh comparability analysis by introducing various filters in
determining the ALP.
