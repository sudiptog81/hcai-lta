              Date of             27/ 01/2020
required details. 4.0 Having heard both the parties, it is our considered
opinion that the Ld. CIT (A) was duty bound to examine and adjudicate the case
on the merits rather than simply following the order of the AO even though the
assessee might have been negligent in pursuing his case. The Ld. CIT (A) is
under mandate to adjudicate the issues before him on merits. Accordingly, in
the interest of justice, we restore the appeal to the file of the Ld. CIT (A)
with the direction to adjudicate the appeal on merits after giving proper
opportunity to the assessee. The Assessee is also  2 ITA No. 1160/Del/2019
Anand Goyal vs ITO directed to cooperate in the first appellate proceedings
when he is called upon to do so.
5.0 In the final result the appeal of the assessee stands allowed for
statistical purposes.
