C.M. Appl. Nos.11725/2020, 11726/2020, 11727/2020, 11728/2020, 11729/2020 and
11731/2020 (Exemption from filing original documents, typed copies of dim and
illegible documents, for filing lengthy synopsis and list of dates and from
filing duly attested affidavits and from filing court fees)
1\. Allowed, subject to just exceptions and as per extant rules.
2\. The applications are disposed of.
LPA 150/2020 & C.M. Appl. Nos.11724/2020 (for Interim relief) and 11730/2020
(for summoning records of WP(C) Nos. 11776/2016 and 3556/2017)
3\. The appeal impugns the judgment dated 20 th May, 2020 of the Single Judge
of this court dismissing the W.P. (C) No.1776/2016 and W.P. (C) No. 3556/2017
filed by the appellants. The challenge by the appellants in the two writ
petitions was to the initiation of proceedings against the appellants under
the Competition Act, 2002. It was the contention of the appellants that
applicability of the Competition Act was excluded inasmuch as the appellants
were governed by the regime of the Patents Act, 1970. The Single Judge in the
impugned judgment has held that the appellants would be governed by both the
statutes.
4\. We have inquired from the senior counsels for the appellants, whether the
patents held by the appellants are still alive.
5\. The senior counsels for the appellants inform that of the two  LPA
150/2020 Page 2 of 5 patents subject matters of the writ petitions aforesaid,
one has lapsed in 2019 and the other is alive till 2022.
6\. We have next inquired from the senior counsels for the appellants, what
would be the position after the patent lapses i.e. whether the Competition Act
would be applicable thereafter or not.
7\. The senior counsels for the appellants state that the proceedings before
the Competition Commission are with respect to the period when the patents
were valid and lapsing of the patents would thus be irrelevant for the
purposes of this appeal. It is also contended that the license agreements
entered into by the appellants with the private respondents were for 10 years
and whereafter the restrictions thereunder are no longer applicable.
8\. It was the contention of the appellants before the Single Judge that the
dicta of a coordinate Bench of the court in judgment dated 30th March, 2016
passed in W.P. (C) No. 464/2014 tiled Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL)
vs. Competition Commission of India stood overruled by the decision of the
Supreme Court in Competition Commission of India vs. Bharti Airtel Ltd. (2019)
2 SCC 521 but the Single Judge has not agreed therewith and thus held
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) supra to be applicable.
9\. It is stated in the memorandum of appeal that the appeal to the Division
Bench against the dicta in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (PUBL) supra being
LPA No. 246/2016 is pending and the counsels, on inquiry inform that the same
is listed next on 27th August, 2020.
LPA 150/2020 Page 3 of 5
10\. Issue Notice.
11\. Notice is accepted by the counsel for the respondent No. 1 Competition
Commission of India, counsel for respondent Nos. 2-4 Nuziveedu Seeds Limited,
Prabhat Agri Biotech Limited and Pravardhan Seeds Private Limited as well as
by counsel for respondent No. 13 Union of India.
12\. Issue notice to the remaining respondents, at the electronic addresses to
be furnished by the appellants within one week.
13\. We have also heard the counsels on the application for interim stay.
14\. During the pendency of the petitions aforesaid, there was an interim
order restraining the Director General (DG) of the Competition Commission of
India from submitting a final report. We are informed that now the DG has
submitted the report and further proceedings are underway but another petition
in that respect is also pending in this court and in which it is the
understanding that no further proceedings will take place before the DG.
15\. In the aforesaid facts, without prejudice to the aforesaid understanding,
till the hearing of this petition the Competition Commission of India is
restrained from returning any final findings.
16\. We may record that the question of patentability of such seeds is also
under consideration before this court in CS (Comm.) 132/2016 and in accordance
with dicta of the Supreme Court in Monsanto Technology LLC vs. Nuziveedu Seeds
Limited (2019) 3 LPA 150/2020 Page 4 of 5 SCC 381.
17\. CM Appl. No.11724/2020 is disposed of.
18\. List the appeal for hearing on 27th August, 2020 alongwith LPA No.
246/2016, which is also stated to be listed on the same date. However, it is
made clear that irrespective of whether LPA No. 246/2016 is heard on that day
or not, this appeal shall be heard.
19\. Written submissions if any required to be submitted, be submitted at
least one day before 27th August, 2020.

hours and the counsels for the Competition Commission of India and private
