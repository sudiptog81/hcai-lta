Ld.AR also has not brought on record any evidence to controvert the
observations made by DRP. Therefore, this ground is dismissed.

4.4 Adopting TNMM as most appropriate method the assessee has short- listed 7
comparable companies after applying certain filters in ACE TP v 6.3 database.
The average margin of the comparable companies after adjustment was 4.56%, As
against this, the assessee has determined its own margin (OP/OC) @ 10.98%
after providing adjustment for excess depreciation and other economic
adjustments. Based on the TP study made above, the taxpayer held that the
transaction was within Arm's Length Price.

5.0 The Transfer Pricing Officer (in short 'TPO') examined the TP study of the
assessee and being not satisfied with the ALP computed by the assessee,
rejected the TP study of the assessee and made independent search process and
selected the separate set of comparables and issued show cause notice for
adopting the comparables selected by the TPO and called for the objections of
the assessee. The assessee filed objections and after considering the
objections raised by the assessee, the Assessing Officer (in short 'AO')
selected the final list of comparables as under:
                   Name of the Company                           Margin

                   Average                                       15.20
Average mean of the comparable companies was worked out to 15.20%. The
assessee has claimed economic adjustment towards unutilized premises amounting
to Rs.1,41,92,554/-, adjustment towards depreciation and working capital.
After careful study of the objections raised by the assessee, the TPO rejected
the objections of the assessee and calculated the PLI of the assessee @8.35%
as against the average mean margin of comparables @15.20% and accordingly
determined the ALP of international transaction at Rs.23.73 Cr. against the
operating ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 7 -:
revenue of the assessee at Rs.22.32 cr. and suggested for upward adjustment of
Rs.1.41 crores as under:
> 8\. PLI Calculation:
> The PLI calculation of the assessee is as follows:
          Description                   (Rs. in Cr.)
          Operating Revenue             22.32

          OP/OC (%)                     8.35%
          ALP Calculation:
          Value of the AE Transaction = Rs.22.32 Cr.
          Margin of the assessee company = 8.35%
          Margin of the comparable company = 15.20%
          If
          Cost    Markup (%)        Sales (%)

          100     15.2              115.2
ALP of the transaction = Rs.22,32 cr x 115.2/108.35 = Rs.23.73 Cr.
± 5% margin of assessee's transaction of 22.32 cr = Rs.21.20 Cr. to Rs.23.45
cr 6.0 Aggrieved by the order of the TPO, the assessee went on appeal before
the Dispute Resolution Panel (in short ''DRP) and the DRP has directed to
remove the M/s.Sankhya Infotech, M/s.KALs Information Systems and
M/s.Goldstone Technologies Ltd., from the list of comparables. The DRP also
rejected the economic adjustments relating to adjustment sought by the
assessee in respect of unoccupied capacity, working capital and depreciation.
The AO has passed the Assessment Order as per the directions of the DRP
u/s.143 r.w.s.144C and made upward adjustment of Rs.1,30,00,000/- in the
Assessment Order against which the assessee is on appeal before us.
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 8 -:
7.0 Ground No.1 is general in nature which does not require specific
adjudication.
8.0 Ground No.2 is related to the exclusion of comparable cases whose turnover
is very high. The TPO has selected the following comparables for arriving the
margin:
> • Mindtree (IT Services segment) - turnover - 1,255.8 Cr.
          •   L&T Infotech Ltd.                -         turnover   -       2,959.50 Cr.
          •   Persistence Systems Ltd.         -         Turnover   -       810.36 Cr.
The Learned Authorized Representative (in short 'Ld.AR') argued that the above
three comparables selected by the TPO are with the turnover of more than
Rs.800 Cr., whereas the assessee's turnover was Rs.22.32 Cr. which is very
small amount and uncomparable. The huge turnover is one of the vital factors
to determine the margins. Both the TPO and the DRP have not considered the
important and vital factor regarding the turnover. Therefore, the Learned AR
(in short 'Ld.AR') argued that the above three companies should be excluded
from the list of the comparables. On the other hand, the Ld.DR argued that the
assessee has adopted the TNMM as most appropriate method and TNMM neutralizes
the deficiencies of turnover filter. Therefore, the Ld.DR vehemently opposed
the exclusion of the above comparables from the list of comparables.
8.1 We heard the rival submissions and perused the material placed before us.
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 9 -:
Admittedly, the turnover of the assessee companies is Rs.22 Crrores and the
turnover of the comparable companies selected by the TPO/AO was more than
Rs.800 Cr. The Ld DRP considered the issue of high turnover and relied on the
decision of ITAT Bangalore Bench in the case of Society General Global
solution Centre (P) Ltd v. DCIT (2016) 69 taxmann.com 336 and Symantec
Software Solutions (P)Ltd v ACIT (2011) 11 taxmann.com 264(Mum) and held that
the assessee has not made out a case as to how the high turnover has impacted
the margins and accordingly rejected the assessee's objection to exclude the
above three companies from the list of comparables. As per Rule 10B, for
selection of a comparable, Turnover and brand value are not the criteria. The
criteria is Functions, Assets and Risks involved. The Ld.TPO in her order
observed that the companies have been identified as comparable companies on
the basis of FAR and no serious FAR based divergences have been brought by the
assessee. The assessee is in the service sector where fixed costs are nominal
and cost of service is proportionate to the services rendered by the assessee.
The Ld. AR relied on Hon'ble Bombay High court decision in Tax Appeal No.18 of
2015 CIT v. M/s.Pentair Water India Pvt. Ltd., wherein it was held that the
turnover is obviously a relevant factor to consider the comparable. In the
case of M/s Pentair Water India Pvt. Ltd, the assessee is engaged in the
business of manufacture of Fibre glass pressure vessel used for water
treatment, Swimming pool equipment and the AY involved is AY 2007-08 and the
assessee is engaged in service sector and the AY involved is 2012-13. The
manufacturing industry is ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 10 -:
capital intensive for which the volumes and turnover of the business is a
relevant factor to meet the huge capital investment and service charges.
Whereas the assessee company is engaged in the service sector for which the
cost of service is proportionate to the services rendered by the assessee. The
Ld.DR brought to our notice during the course of appeal hearing that the
Hon'ble Bombay High court has not considered Rule 10B(2) in the case law
relied up on by the assessee. The Ld.AR did not controvert the submission made
by the DR in respect of Rule 10B(2). Therefore the case law relied upon by the
assessee not applicable in assessee's case. Though turnover is a relevant
factor the assessee has to make out case that the huge turnover has materially
impacted the margins of the company. In the instant case the assessee has not
demonstrated that the high or low turnover has influenced the operating margin
of the asseessee company. The Ld.DRP observed that operating margin has no
direct relation between the turnover and the margin. In TNMM method merely
because of high turnover the comparables cannot be excluded unless the
assessee demonstrates that the turnover has materially impacted the margins in
relevant assessment year. Accordingly we reject the assessee's contention to
exclude the above companies as comparables on the basis of turnover filter.
8.2 Next contention of the assessee is to exclude the above three comparables
on functional differences. This issue has been considered by the DRP in its
order dated 31/08/2016 in detail in Para No.4.3 to 4.5 of it's ITA
No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 11 -:
direction. For the sake of convenience we extract the relevant paragraphs of
the DRP directions.
4.3 As regards assessee's claim that M/s.Mindtree is functionally different,
from the annual report of this company it is evident that it is operating in
two segments and segmental details are available and the same have been used
by the TPO. In fact, the assessee has wrongly mixed up the functions of group
companies of M/s.Mindtree with that of the company itself to arrive at its
conclusion of functional difference. Considering above, the objection of the
assessee in relation to this comparable is not accepted. 4.4 The assessee has
also objected to inclusion of M/s.L&T Infotech as comparable by claiming that
the same is involved in other segments of business and that segmental details
are not available. However, on examining the annual report of the company it
is observed that there is some resale of products, however the cost of bought
out items for resale is only Rs.22.82 crore as against total operating
expenditure of Rs.2358.85 crore i.e. a meagre 0.97%. Thus the effect of such
sale would hardly be there in the case of this comparable. As regards
assessee's reliance on information from the website for showing different
functions performed by the company, the same is misplaced as the same
represent the state of affairs at the time when website is accessed and not
the past years. Further the details in the website are only indicative of the
functions which the company is ready to perform but may not have been
necessarily performed by it in some earlier years. So the annual report and
not the website needs to be relied upon for the actual functions performed by
the company. The objections of the assessee have also been dealt in detail by
the TPO in his order, which cannot be faulted with. Considering above, the
objection of the assessee in relation to this comparable is not accepted. 4.5
As regards assessee's claim that Persistent Systems Ltd is in software product
development, it is observed that the company is developing software for its
customers whom turn are in business of software product development and
outsourcing the work of onward development to this company. Thus the assessee
has wrongly inferred that the M/s.Persistent Systems Ltd., itself is in
software product development. In fact, the assessee itself is similarly placed
as it is developing software for its AE, which in turn is finally using it in
its software products. Considering above, the objection of the assessee is not
accepted.
8.3 Both TPO and the DRP have considered the objections raised by the assessee
with regard to functional differences rejected the assessee's objections as
discussed above. No fresh material has been brought by the Ld.AR before us to
controvert the findings of the lower authorities. Therefore, we do not incline
to interfere with the directions of the DRP and the TPO and accordingly we
reject the assessee's contention to exclude the above three comparables from
the list of comparables and dismiss the assessee ground on this issue.
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 12 -:
9.0 Ground No.3 is related to the exclusion of the companies having diverse
activities as under:
> 1\. Thirdware Solutions Ltd.
> 2\. Acropetal Technologies Ltd.
3\. Spry Resources Pvt. LTd., 9.1 During the appeal, hearing the Ld.AR argued
that all the above three companies should be excluded from the list of
comparables due to functional dissimilarity and diverse activities. The Ld.AR
submitted the functional dissimilarities of the above companies independently
company- wise. The assessee company is engaged in the functions as per the
functional profile designing, architecture, testing, implementation, support
and IT infrastructure which are major functions of the assessee company. As
per the TP document, the assessee company provides software design,
development, support maintenance data processing services to its parent
company. Whereas the functions of the comparable companies selected by the TPO
in the case of the above three companies are not similar to that of the
assessee company and having diverse nature functions. The objections raised by
the Ld.AR for each company has been examined by us and the decision of this
Tribunal is as under:
9.2 M/s.Thirdware Solutions Ltd:
The TPO has selected the M/s.Third Ware Solutions Ltd., with 28.18% of PLI and
Rs.105.68 Cr. turnover as comparable. The Ld.AR objected for selection of this
comparable. According to the Ld.AR, the assessee's company is engaged in
development, consulting and related ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 13 -:
space, major alliances such as Salesforce, oracle, Birst, SAP, Informatica and
CXO, cockpit. According to the Ld.AR, the companies are functionally
dissimilar which required to be excluded from the list of comparables. The
assessee raised the objections before the TPO as well as the DRP and brought
out the functional dissimilarity of the comparable company as discussed above.
The TPO as well as DRP have summarily rejected the objections raised by the
assessee. The Hon'ble Bangalore Bench in M/s.SAP Labs India Pvt. Ltd.,
reported in IT(TP)A No.1006/Bang/2011 dated 30.06.2016 considered the issue on
functional dissimilarity and directed to exclude the company with functional
dissimilarity from the list of comparables.
9.3 The assessee has reiterated the submissions made before the TPO and DRP
and the lower authorities dismissed the assessee's objection stating that
alliences do not determine the functionality of the company. However the fact
with regard to the functional dissimilarity how the functions of the assessee
company are not similar has not been demonstrated by the Ld AR and was not
verified by the lower authorities. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion
that the issue should be remitted back to the file of the AO for further
verification of the functions of the comparable company with the tested party
and decide the issue afresh on merits. Accordingly, this issue is remitted
back to the file of the AO.
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 14 -:
9.4 M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd:
The Ld.AR argued that M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd., is engaged in product
development, whereas the assessee company is only software services provider.
The comparable company also having significant intangibles. The Ld.AR of the
assessee has invited our attention to Page No.108 of Paper Book wherein
intangibles are reported in the financial statement at Rs.19.05 Cr. The Ld.AR
also invited our attention to Page No.171 of Paper Book where segmental
information includes engineering design, information technology and health
care. The Ld.AR argued that the company is dissimilar in functions as well as
non comparable on assets declared by the company. According to the Ld.AR, the
FAR analysis of the company is completely different from that of the assessee
company, the Ld.AR relied on the decision of ITAT Bangalore 'C' Bench in the
case of M/s.Symphony Marketing Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. v. ITO reported in
(2013) 38 Taxmann.com 55. (Bangalore-Trib.) The Hon'ble ITAT Bangalore given a
ruling that this company could not be selected as comparable in view of
functional dissimilarity. We reproduce here under the relevant part of the
decision of the Hon'ble ITAT in respect of M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd. in
the case of M/s.Symphony Marketing Solutions India Pvt. Ltd., as under:
> M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seq.) • On a perusal of notes to accounts
> which gives segmental revenue of this company, it is clear that the major
> source of income for this company is from providing Engineering Design
> Service and Information Technology Services. The functions performed by the
> Engineering Design Services segment of the company cannot be considered as
> comparable to the ITES/BPO functions performed by the assessee.
> ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 15 -:
> • The performance of Engineering Design Services is regarded as providing
> high end services among the BPO which requires high skill whereas the
> services performed by the assessee are routine low end ITES- functions.
> • Therefore, this company could not have been selected as a comparable,
> especially when it performs engineering design services which only a
> Knowledge Process Outsourcing [KPO] would do and not a Business Process
> Outsourcing [BPOJ.
Respectfully following the decision of ITAT Bangalore, we direct the AO/TPO to
exclude the M/s.Acropetal Technologies Ltd., from the list of comparables.
9.5 M/s.Spry Resources Pvt. Ltd:
The TPO selected M/s.Spry Resources Ltd., as comparable to the assessee
company. The assessee objected before the TPO and the DRP. Both DRP and TPO
have rejected the assessee's objection to exclude Spry Resources Ltd. as a
comparable. The Ld.AR submitted that the company is mainly engaged in the
government projects and in government projects the margins are very high.
Further the Ld AR also objected relying note given on revenue recognition. On
the other hand, the Ld.DR supported the orders of the lower authorities.
9.6 We heard the rival submissions and perused the material placed on record.
The assessee has raised objection of revenue recognition as per the note on
Revenue recognition. This issue has been dealt in the DRP order as under:
> 4.11 The objection of the assessee regarding Spry Resources India Pvt. Ltd.
> that as per revenue recognition method, it is in product development and
> its, projects are related to e-
> ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 16 -:
> Governance. The objections of the assessee have suitably been dealt by the
> TPO in her order. Revenue recognition statement in annual report is a
> general statement, which specifies the treatment, if a particular type of
> revenue is there in the case of the company. This does not mean that the
> company has actually earned revenue from that stream. So this argument of
> the assessee does not have any merit.
Though the assessee has raised objections for Revenue recognition, we have not
come across any objectionable methods which have material impact on margins or
inconsistencies in the note of Revenue recognition. The Ld.AR of the assessee
did not bring any functional dissimilarity, assets deployed and the impact of
margins in relation to note on Revenue recongnition. The turnover is also
comparable to the tested party. Merely because of the assessee is engaged in
the government projects, the company cannot be excluded from the list of
comparables. The assessee's argument that in Government projects margins are
very high is not well founded .The Ld.AR has not brought on record any
evidence to establish that the assessee's margins are less and the margins in
government projects are very high. Therefore, the objection of the assessee to
exclude M/s.Spry Resources Ltd., from the list of comparables is rejected and
the decision of the AO/TPO/DRP is upheld.
10.0 Ground No.4 is related to the exclusion of the following comparables Suo
moto by the DRP:
> • M/s.Sankhya Infotech Ltd.
> • KALS Information Systems • Goldstone Technologies Ltd.
The Ld.AR submitted that the above three companies were selected by the TPO
holding that the companies are functionally comparable but ITA
No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 17 -:
the DRP has removed the above companies from the list of comparables on its
own accord. Since the functions of the companies and the turnover of the
company are comparable, the same should be included in the list of
comparables.
10.1 We heard the rival submissions and perused the material placed before us
and deal with the companies removed by the DRP independently as under:
10.2 M/s.Sankya Infotech Ltd:
The DRP has found from the Annual Report of the company that it is engaged in-
house research and development centre involved in the development activities
of new products in the field of simulation and training. During the year the
company has debited an amount of Rs.4.94 crores as R&D expenditure and of this
Rs.4.83 crores was employee cost. That the company is in research and
development and thus developing its own intangibles also becomes evident from
the fact that intangible fixed assets are only Rs.78.27 lakhs against
intangible assets of Rs.42.46 Cr. These intangibles include learning
management products, training management products, simulator products,
knowledge based contents etc., as against the normal intangible software
purchase in case of routine software developer. From the above information it
is clear that the company is in technical training and R&D in addition to
software development. Complete segmental data relating to revenue from each
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 18 -:
segment and the expenses are not available. DRP was of the view that the
company is functionally dissimilar and the facts were confronted with the
assessee during the hearing by the DRP. The assessee failed controvert the
above findings of the DRP, hence the DRP has directed the AO/TPO to exclude
M/s.Sankhya Infotech Ltd., from the list of comparables. The Ld.AR while
arguing for exclusion of comparable in the case of M/s.Acropetal Technologies
Ltd., assigned the reasoning of significant intangibles and functional
dissimilarity. M/s.Sankya Infotech also having significant intangibles and
functionally dissimilar as observed by the DRP in it's directions. The Ld.AR
did not bring any evidence to controvert the findings of the DRP. On the
similar facts and circumstances we have directed to exclude M/s.Acropetal
Technologies Ltd., from the list of comparables. Following the consistency we
hold that the Ld.DRP has rightly directed the AO/TPO to exclude M/s.Sankhya
Infotech from the list of comparables and the assessee's appeal on this issue
is dismissed, 10.3 M/s.KALS Information Systems:
The DRP while examining the annual accounts observed that the company is
engaged in the development of software and software products. The company is
also having a training centre engaged in training software professionals
online projects. Out of the total Revenue of Rs.2.73 Cr the translation and
interpretation fee was Rs.51.67 lakhs. and no segmental information related to
software products training income, translation and interpretation fee is
available. The translation and ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 19 -:
interpretation fee received by the comparable company is functionally
dissimilar from the tested party and there was no segmental information with
regard to the software products, training income, translation fee is
available. The Ld.AR except stating that the M/s.KALS Information Systems is
functionally comparable company, no evidence was placed before the DRP to
controvert the findings, hence DRP has removed M/s.KALS as comparable though
it was selected by the TPO. No other details were furnished controverting the
findings given by the DRP by the Ld.A.R. From the findings of the DRP it is
established that the company is functionally not comparable and we do not find
any infirmity in the direction of the DRP and the same is upheld.
10.4 M/s.Goldstone Technologies Ltd:
With respect to the M/s.Gold Stone Technologies Ltd., also the DRP observed
that the functions of the company were dissimilar and it is only engaged in
the IT segment not in software development. The findings of the DRP are made
available in Para No.4.14 to 4.16 which are extracted hereunder for the sake
of convenience:
> 4.14 While examining the annual report (Page 11 of the report) of M/s.

The DRP relied on the decision of ITAT Bangalore in M/s. Trilogy E- Business
Software v. DCIT ITAT No.1054/Bang/2011 AY 2007-08. Therefore, we do not find
any reason to interfere with the directions of the DRP and the same is upheld.
11.0 Ground No.5 is related to the inclusion of the following comparable
selected by the assessee which were rejected by the TPO:
> • CG-VAK Software Exports • Avani Cimcon Technologies ITA No.3404/Mds/2016
> :- 21 -:
11.1 M/s.CG-VAK Software Systems Ltd.:
Both TPO & DRP have rejected the assessee's request for inclusion of the above
two companies as comparables. The assessee relied on the decision of TIBCO
Software India Pvt. Ltd. V. DCIT in ITA No.2536 (PN) of 2012 and argued that
Persistence Loss making company is not a reason for exclusion of the
comparable companies.
We heard both the parties and perused the material placed on record and gone
through the decision of Co-ordinate Bench in the case law cited supra. The
Hon'ble ITAT in the case of TIBCO Software India Pvt. Ltd. V. DCIT in ITA
No.2536 (PN) of 2012 [2015] 56 taxmann.com 91 (Pune-Trib.) directed the
AO/TPO/DRP to include comparable company holding that the uncontrolled
transaction, if it a reflects loss would be normal incidence of business loss
unless any peculiarity or any abnormal situation of uncontrolled transaction
is brought on record, For ready reference we extract the gist of the decision
from the order of the Hon'ble coordinate bench as under:
> Comparable CG- VAK Software Systems Ltd.
> • The said concern has been excluded from the list of comparables on the
> ground that it has incurred a loss, whereas assessee's business model is
> cost plus mark up. [Para 26] • The point sought to be made out by the TPO is
> quite mis-placed having regard to the purpose and import of the
> comparability analysis of the international transaction being undertaken for
> determining its arm's length price. Ostensibly, the whole objective of the
> transfer pricing proceeding is that the contours of an un- controlled
> transaction shall reflect a measure of arm's length price of the tested
> international transaction. The un-controlled transaction, if it reflects a
> loss, would not normally be excludible unless any peculiarity in such un-
> controlled transaction is brought out. For instance, the un-controlled
> transaction is of an entity which is consistently loss making or that the
> loss has arisen in the un-controlled transaction on account of an abnormal
> fact-situation, etc. In such situations, ostensibly, the un-controlled
> transaction would not reflect a normal business situation. In the present
> case, the comparable in question has incurred a loss; notably, incurrence of
> ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 22 -:
> loss in business operations is a normal incident of business and there is
> nothing to suggest in the present case that it has been incurred in any
> abnormal situation. It is also not the case the revenue that the said
> concern is a consistently loss making concern. Therefore, the said concern
> cannot be excluded merely because of incurrence of loss in relevant year,
> especially when the said loss has not been established to be an abnormal
> business condition and more so in the context that the said concern is not
> denied to be functionally comparable to the assessee. Therefore, on this
> aspect, the plea of the assessee for including the said concern in the final
> set of comparables in order to determine the arm's length price of the
> international transaction is upheld. [Para 29].
From the decision of the Hon'ble ITAT, it is also observed that the Hon'ble
ITAT directed to include the company in the list of comparables for the
reasons that the company is not making consistent losses. In the case of
comparable company, the company is making persistent losses right from 2008-09
onwards. The assessee in its transfer document in Page No.267 of Paper Book
has excluded the companies making persistent lossess from the list of
comparables. When the assessee himself has accepted that companies making
persistent losses as not good comparables in its transfer documentation, we do
not find any reason to dispute with the assessee's stand and to include the
same as comparable since the company is incurring persistent losses.
Therefore, the assessee's request to include M/s.CG-VAK software Systems Ltd.,
in the list of comparables is rejected.
11.2 M/s.Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.:
The assessee's requested for inclusion of M/s.Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.,
which was selected by the assessee as comparables. The TPO excluded the
company from the list of comparables since the company is engaged in products
such as dexchange and financials does ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 23 -:
not give segmental data of software development and sale of software products.
Hence the TPO was of the view that entire operational result of the company
cannot be considered as comparable and accordingly rejected the assessee's
request. The Ld.AR argued that the assessee company is engaged in the low end
software services and comparable company is also engaged in software
development services as evidenced from the Annual Report. Neither the TPO nor
the DRP has gone in to the details as to why the company should not be taken
as comparable and how the company is functionally not comparable. Therefore,
we are of the considered opinion that the case should be remitted back to the
file of the AO/TPO to verify the functional similarity and decide the issue
afresh on merits. Accordingly, the inclusion of Avani Cimcon as comparable is
remitted back to the file of the AO to decide the issue a fresh on merits.
12.0 In Ground No.2 to 5 we have directed the AO/TPO to exclude some
comparables and to include some companies in the list of comparables. AO is
free to select new comparables on functional similarities after giving
opportunity to the assessee to determine the ALP. We direct the AO to make a
fresh search process and select the new comparables if necessary and determine
the ALP afresh.
In the light of the above discussion, the entire issue of selection of
comparables is set-aside to the file of the AO.
ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 24 -:
13.0 Ground No.6 is related to the working capital adjustment:
The DRP has rejected the objections raised by the assessee for giving working
capital adjustment since there was no negative working capital and the
assessee could not demonstrate the material impact on the margins for
adjustment of working capital. The Ld.DRP also relied on the decision of this
Tribunal in the case of M/s.Mobis India Ltd., in ITA No.2112/Mds/2011 AY
2007-08. The issue is set-aside to the file of the AO to examine the facts
with relevance to the observations made by this Tribunal, in the case cited
supra with the facts of the assessee's case. Apart from the above, the
assessee is required to furnish the pricing model of the AE as well as the
tested party to verify whether the working capital margin of interest is
included in the sales price of the product. The AO is directed to examine the
above issues and allow the suitable working capital adjustment while
determining the ALP.
14.0 Ground No.7 is related to depreciation adjustment charged in excess of
Schedule-4 of Companies Act:
The DRP has rejected the assessee's request for adjustment of excess
Depreciation placing reliance on the decision of Lason India Pvt. Ltd. V. ACIT
[2012] 50 SOT 583/19.Taxmann.com 323 (Chennai). The Tribunal rejected the
claim of the assessee with the following observations:
> The assessee provided depreciation on assets under SLM at the rates higher
> than those provided in Schedule XIV, whereas the comparables provided for
> depreciation as per Income tax Rules on written down value method The
> assessee claimed before the Tribunal that if depreciation of the assessee is
> also brought to the w.d.v. method, then its operating ITA No.3404/Mds/2016
> :- 25 -:
> profit would be more. The Tribunal rejected this claim of the assessee. So
> following the decision of jurisdictional Bench the objection of the assessee
> cannot be accepted.
Since the DRP has rejected the assessee's request for adjustment of
Depreciation placing reliance on the decision of this tribunal we do not find
any error in the direction of the DRP and the same is upheld. The assessee's
appeal on this ground is dismissed.
15.0 Ground No.8 unutilized capacity adjustment:
The assessee claimed unutilized capacity adjustment of premises rent of
Rs.1,41,92,551/-. The assessee submitted that the company has taken lease of
two floors in the premises occupied by it. The company was established as a
start up in 2008 by its overseas holding the company with a certain expected
level of full occupancy for both the 3rd floor & the 4 floor. However, the
assessee could not recruit employees for substantial capacity and the non
recovery of the costs associated with the vacant capacity should be
legitimately borne by the assessee and hence adjustment for the same is
warranted upon analysing the no. of seats that were vacant during the AY
12-13, it was observed that there was an utilized capacity to the extent of
46.54%... the unutilized capacity represents cost incurred for which no
commensuration of revenue that was earned.
15.1 The assessee raised objection before the DRP and the DRP has rejected the
assessee's claim distinguishing the reliance placed by the assessee on various
case laws as under:
> ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 26 -:
> 6.1 This was submitted by the assessee that the TPO failed to appreciate the
> fact that 46.54% of the total seats were completely unoccupied and the
> expenditure incurred for that part of the capacity was unabsorbed and would
> not have earned any income. Assessee relied upon decisions in case of
> Ariston Thermo India Limited .vs. DCIT - ITA No.1455/PN/2010-ITAT, Pune for
> the same.
> 6.2 The submissions of the assessee have duly been considered. The assessee
> has relied on some decisions as referred supra. In the case of Arision

15.2 The assessee not a start up company and it has commenced its operations
way back in 2008. The adjustments relating to unutilised capacity are allowed
in the case of start up companies to cover the initial deficiencies and the
financial implications. Since the company is established in 2008 and the Ld.AR
did not place any material with regard to the observations made by the DRP We
are unable to accept the contention of the assessee and the assessee's appeal
on this ground is dismissed.
16.0 Ground No.9 is related to the adjustment not provided by the Ld.DRP in
respect of Return on net worth, non adoption of CPM as supplementary method,
Non provision of Risk management were vehemently argued by the Ld.AR but no
material placed before us to ITA No.3404/Mds/2016 :- 27 -:
controvert the observations of the DRP/TPO. Therefore, this ground of appeal
is dismissed.
17.0 Ground No.10 is related to the issue for rectification:
These issues are discussed in detail by the DRP. The assessee raised issues
for rectification against the order passed u/s.154. The appeal against the
order u/s.154 is a separate appeal which cannot be decided in this appeal. The
Ld.AR also has not brought on record any evidence to controvert the
observations made by DRP. Therefore, this ground is dismissed.
18.0 In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
