request as aforesaid refuses to give such duplicate bill, he may be compelled
to do so.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
46. Delivery.—The making, acceptance or indorsement of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is completed by delivery, actual or constructive. As between parties standing in immediate relation; delivery to be effectual must be made by the party making, accepting or indorsing the instrument, or by a person authorized by him in that behalf. As between such parties and any holder of the instrument other than a holder in due course, it may be shown that the instrument was delivered conditionally or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring absolutely the property therein. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by the delivery thereof. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to order is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
47. Negotiation by delivery.—Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by delivery thereof.
(Exception) —A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque delivered on
condition that it is not to take effect except in a certain event is not
negotiable (except in the hands of a holder for value without notice of the
condition) unless such event happens. Illustrations
(a) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, delivers it to
B’s agent to keep for B. The instrument has been negotiated.
(b) A, the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer, which is in
the hands of A’s banker, who is at the time the banker of B, directs the
banker to transfer the instrument to B’s credit in the banker’s account with
B. The banker does so, and accordingly now possesses the instrument as B’s
agent. The instrument has been negotiated, and B has become the holder of it.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
48. Negotiation by indorsement.—Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque 1[payable to order], is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
49. Conversion of indorsement in blank into indorsement in full.—The holder of a negotiable instrument indorsed in blanks may, without signing his own name, by writing above the indorser’s signature a direction to pay to any other person as indorsee, convert the indorsement in blank into an indorsement in full; and the holder does not thereby incur the responsibility of an indorser.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
50. Effect of indorsement.—The indorsement of a negotiable instrument followed by delivery transfers to the indorsee the property therein with the right of further negotiation; but the indorsement may, by express words, restrict or exclude such right, or may merely constitute the indorsee an agent to indorse the instrument, or to receive its contents for the indorser, or for some other specified person. Illustrations B signs the following indorsements on different negotiable instruments payable to bearer:—
(a) “Pay the contents to C only.”
(b) “Pay C for my use.”
(c) “Pay C or order for the account of B.”
(d) “The within must be credited to C.” These indorsements exclude the right
of further negotiation by C.
(e) “Pay C.”
(f) “Pay C value in account with the Oriental Bank.”
(g) “Pay the contents to C, being part of the consideration in a certain deed
of assignment executed by C to the indorser and others.” These indorsements do
not exclude the right of further negotiation by C.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
51. Who may negotiate.—Every sole maker, drawer, payee or indorsee, or all of several joint makers, drawers, payees or indorsees, of a negotiable instrument may, if the negotiability of such instrument has not been restricted or excluded as mentioned in section 50, indorse and negotiate the same. Explanation.—Nothing in this section enables a maker or drawer to indorse or negotiate an instrument, unless he is in lawful possession or is holder thereof; or enables a payee or indorsee to indorse or negotiate an instrument, unless he is holder thereof. Illustration A bill is drawn payable to A or order. A indorses it to B, the indorsement not containing the words “or order” or any equivalent words. B may negotiate the instrument.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
52. Indorser who excludes his own liability or makes it conditional.—The indorser of a negotiable instrument may, by express words in the indorsement, exclude his own liability thereon, or make such liability or the right of the indorsee to receive the amount due thereon depend upon the happening of a specified event, although such event may never happen. Where an indorser so excludes his liability and afterwards becomes the holder of the instrument all intermediate indorsers are liable to him. Illustrations
(a) The indorser of a negotiable instrument signs his name, adding the words—
“Without recourse”. Upon this indorsement he incurs no liability.
(b) A is the payee and holder of a negotiable instrument. Excluding personal
liability by an indorsement “without recourse”, he transfers the instrument to
B, and B indorses it to C, who indorses it to A. A is not only reinstated in
his former rights, but has the rights of an indorsee against B and C.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
53. Holder deriving title from holder in due course.—A holder of a negotiable instrument who derives title from a holder in due course has the rights thereon of that holder in due course.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
54. Instrument indorsed in blank.—Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to crossed cheques, a negotiable instrument indorsed in blank is payable to the bearer thereof even although originally payable to order.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
55. Conversion of indorsement in blank into indorsement in full.—If a negotiable instrument, after having been indorsed in blank, is indorsed in full, the amount of it cannot be claimed from the indorser in full, except by the person to whom it has been indorsed in full, or by one who derives title through such person.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
56. Indorsement for part of sum due.—No writing on a negotiable instrument is valid for the purpose of negotiation if such writing purports to transfer only a part of the amount appearing to be due on the instrument; but where such amount has been partly paid a note to that effect may be indorsed on the instrument, which may then be negotiated for the balance.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
57. Legal representative cannot by delivery only negotiate instrument indorsed by deceased.—The legal representative of a deceased person cannot negotiate by delivery only a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to order and indorsed by the deceased but not delivered.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
58. Instrument obtained by unlawful means or for unlawful consideration.—When a negotiable instrument has been lost, or has been obtained from any maker, acceptor or holder thereof by means of an offence or fraud, or for an unlawful consideration, no possessor or indorsee who claims through the person who found or so obtained the instrument is entitled to receive the amount due thereon from such maker, acceptor or holder, or from any party prior to such holder, unless such possessor or indorsee is, or some person through whom he claims was, a holder thereof in due course.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
59. Instrument acquired after dishonour or when overdue.—The holder of a negotiable instrument, who has acquired it after dishonour, whether by non-acceptance or non-payment, with notice thereof, or after maturity, has only, as against the other parties, the rights thereon of his transferor. Accommodation note or bill.—Provided that any person who, in good faith and for consideration, becomes the holder, after maturity, of a promissory note or bill of exchange made, drawn or accepted without consideration, for the purpose of enabling some party thereto to raise money thereon, may recover the amount of the note or bill from any prior party. Illustration The acceptor of a bill of exchange, when he accepted it, deposited with the drawer certain goods as a collateral security for the payment of the bill, with power to the drawer to sell the goods and apply the proceeds in discharge of the bill if it were not paid at maturity. The bill not having been paid at maturity, the drawer sold the goods and retained the proceeds, but indorsed the bill to A. A’s title is subject to the same objection as the drawer’s title.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
60. Instrument negotiable till payment or satisfaction.—A negotiable instrument may be negotiated (except by the maker, drawee or acceptor after maturity) until payment or satisfaction thereof by the maker, drawee or acceptor at or after maturity, but not after such payment or satisfaction.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
61. Presentment for acceptance.—A bill of exchange payable after sight must, if no time or place is specified therein for presentment, be presented to the drawee thereof for acceptance, if he can, after reasonable search, be found, by a person entitled to demand acceptance, within a reasonable time after it is drawn, and in business hours on a business day. In default of such presentment, no party thereto is liable thereon to the person making such default. If the drawee cannot, after reasonable search, be found, the bill is dishonoured. If the bill is directed to the drawee at a particular place, it must be presented at that place; and if at the due date for presentment he cannot, after reasonable search, be found there, the bill is dishonoured. 1[Where authorized by agreement or usage, a presentment through the post office by means of a registered letter is sufficient.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
62. Presentment of promissory note for sight.—A promissory note, payable at a certain period after sight must be presented to the maker thereof for sight (if he can after reasonable search be found) by a person entitled to demand payment, within a reasonable time after it is made and in business hours on a business day. In default of such presentment, no party thereto is liable thereon to the person making such default.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
63. Drawee’s time for deliberation.—The holder must, if so required by the drawee of a bill of exchange presented to him for acceptance, allow the drawee 1[forty-eight] hours (exclusive of public holidays) to consider whether he will accept it.

64. Presentment for payment.—1[
(1) ] Promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques must be presented for
payment to the maker, acceptor or drawee thereof respectively, by or on behalf
of the holder as hereinafter provided. In default of such presentment, the
other parties thereto are not liable thereon to such holder. 2[Where
authorized by agreement or usage, a presentment through the post office by
means of a registered letter is sufficient.]
(Exception) —Where a promissory note is payable on demand and is not payable
at a specified place, no presentment is necessary in order to charge the maker
thereof. 3[(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 6, where an
electronic image of a truncated cheque is presented for payment, the drawee
bank is entitled to demand any further information regarding the truncated
cheque from the bank holding the truncated cheque in case of any reasonable
suspicion about the genuineness of the apparent tenor of instrument, and if
the suspicion is that of any fraud, forgery, tampering or destruction of the
instrument, it is entitled to further demand the presentment of the truncated
cheque itself for verification: Provided that the truncated cheque so demanded
by the drawee bank shall be retained by it, if the payment is made
accordingly.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
65. Hours for presentment.—Presentment for payment must be made during the usual hours of business and, if at a banker’s, within banking hours.

1[75A. Excuse for delay in presentment for acceptance or payment.—Delay in
presentment 2[for acceptance or payment] is excused if the delay is caused by

THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
76. When presentment unnecessary.—No presentment for payment is necessary, and the instrument is dishonoured at the due date for presentment, in any of the following cases:—
(a) if the maker, drawee or acceptor intentionally prevents the presentment of
the instrument, or if the instrument being payable at his place of business,
he closes such place on a business day during the usual business hours, or if
the instrument being payable at some other specified place, neither he nor any
person authorized to pay it attends at such place during the usual business

1[84. When cheque not duly presented and drawer damaged thereby.—
(1) Where a cheque is not presented for payment within a reasonable time of
its issue, and the drawer or person on whose account it is drawn had the
right, at the time when presentment ought to have been made, as between
himself and the banker, to have the cheque paid and suffers actual damage
through the delay, he is discharged to the extent of such damage, that is to
say, to the extent to which such drawer or person is a creditor of the banker
to a large amount than he would have been if such cheque had been paid.
(2) In determining what is a reasonable time, regard shall be had to the
nature of the instrument, the usage of trade and of bankers, and the facts of
the particular case.
(3) The holder of the cheque as to which such drawer or person is so
discharged shall be a creditor, in lieu of such drawer or person, of such
banker to the extent of such discharge and entitled to recover the amount from
him. Illustrations

(b) A draws a cheque at Ambala on a bank in Calcutta. The bank fails before
the cheque could be presented in ordinary course. A is not discharged, for he
has not suffered actual damage through any delay in presenting the cheque.]

negotiation.]

crossed or to have had a crossing which has been obliterated, payment thereof
by a person or banker liable to pay and paying the same according to the
apparent tenor thereof at the time of payment and otherwise in due course,
shall discharge such person or banker from all liability thereon; and such
payment shall not be questioned by reason of the instrument having been
altered, or the cheque crossed. 2[(2) Where the cheque is an electronic image
of a truncated cheque, any difference in apparent tenor of such electronic
image and the truncated cheque shall be a material alteration and it shall be
the duty of the bank or the clearing house, as the case may be, to ensure the
exactness of the apparent tenor of electronic image of the truncated cheque
while truncating and transmitting the image.
(3) Any bank or a clearing house which receives a transmitted electronic image
of a truncated cheque, shall verify from the party who transmitted the image
to it, that the image so transmitted to it and received by it, is exactly the

THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
94.

If the notice is duly directed and sent by post and miscarries, such miscarriage does not render the notice invalid.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
95. Party receiving must transmit notice of dishonour.—Any party receiving notice of dishonour must, in order to render any prior party liable to himself, give notice of dishonour to such party within a reasonable time, unless such party otherwise receives due notice as provided by section 93.

of his own to give it;

99. Noting.—When a promissory note or bill of exchange has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment, the holder may cause such dishonour to be noted by a notary public upon the instrument, or upon a paper attached thereto, or partly upon each. Such note must be made within a reasonable time after dishonour, and must specify the date of dishonour, the reason, if any, assigned for such dishonour, or, if the instrument has not been expressly dishonoured, the reason why the holder treats it as dishonoured, and the notary’s charges.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881

may be, has been demanded of such person by the notary public; the terms of
his answer, if any, or a statement that he gave no answer, or that he could
not be found;

such bill is dishonoured, the party dishonouring the same is liable to make
compensation thereof in the same manner as in the case of the original bill.

THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
129. Payment of crossed cheque out of due course.—Any banker paying a cheque crossed generally otherwise than to a banker, or a cheque crossed specially otherwise than to the banker to whom the same is crossed, or his agent for collection, being a banker, shall be liable to the true owner of the cheque for any loss he may sustain owing to the cheque having been so paid.

THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
1[131A. Application of Chapter to drafts.—The provisions of this Chapter shall
apply to any draft, as defined in section 85A, as if the draft were a cheque.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
132. Set of bills.—Bills of exchange may be drawn in parts, each part being numbered and containing a provision that it shall continue payable only so long as the others remain unpaid. All the parts together make a set; but the whole set constitutes only one bill, and is extinguished when one of the parts, if a separate bill, would be extinguished.
(Exception) —When a person accepts or indorses different parts of the bill in

THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
135. Law of place of payment governs dishonour.—Where a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is made payable in a different place from that in which it is made or indorsed, the law of the place where it is made payable determines what constitutes dishonour and what notice of dishonour is sufficient.

The indorsee causes it to be protested for such dishonour, and gives notice thereof in accordance with the law of France though not in accordance with the rules herein contained in respect of bills which are not foreign. The notice is sufficient.
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
136. Instrument made, etc., out of India, but in accordance with the law of India.—If a negotiable instrument is made, drawn accepted or indorsed 1[outside India], but in accordance with the 2[law of India], the circumstance that any agreement evidenced by such instrument is invalid according to the law of the country wherein it was entered into does not invalidate any subsequent acceptance or indorsement made thereon 3[within India].
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
137. Presumption as to foreign law.—The law of any foreign country 1[***] regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2[India], unless and until the contrary is proved.

—Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a
banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that
account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other
liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of
money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the
cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by
an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have
committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of
this Act, be punished with imprisonment for 19 [a term which may be extended
to two years], or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the
cheque, or with both: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall
apply unless—

from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity,
whichever is earlier;
(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the case may be,
makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice
in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, 20 [within thirty days] of the
receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque
as unpaid; and
(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of
money to the payee or, as the case may be, to the holder in due course of the
cheque, within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice.
Explanation.— For the purposes of this section, “debt or other liability”
means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
1[139. Presumption in favour of holder.—It shall be presumed, unless the
contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the
nature referred to in section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of
any debt or other liability.]
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881
1[140. Defence which may not be allowed in any prosecution under section
138.—It shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence under section
138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that
the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that
section.]
21 [ 141 Offences by companies. —
(1) If the person committing an offence under section 138 is a company, every
person who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as
well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be
liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly: Provided that nothing
contained in this sub-section shall render any person liable to punishment if
he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge, or that he had
exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence: 22
[Provided further that where a person is nominated as a Director of a company
by virtue of his holding any office or employment in the Central Government or
State Government or a financial corporation owned or controlled by the Central
Government or the State Government, as the case may be, he shall not be liable
for prosecution under this Chapter.]
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where any offence
under this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the
offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is
attributable to, any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary
or other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other
officer shall also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable
to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Explanation.— For the
purposes of this section,—
(a) “company” means any body corporate and includes a firm or other
association of individuals; and
(b) “director”, in relation to a firm, means a partner in the firm.]
23 [ 142 Cognizance of offences. —Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)—
(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138
except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be,
the holder in due course of the cheque;
(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of
action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138: 24 [Provided
that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the Court after the
prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the Court that he had
sufficient cause for not making a complaint within such period.]
(c) no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial
Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under section
138.] COMMENTS
(i) Consequent upon the failure of the drawer to pay the money within the
period of 15 days as envisaged under clause (c) of the proviso to section 138,
the liability of the drawer for being prosecuted for the offence he has
committed, arises, and the period of one month for filing the complaint under
section 142 is to be reckoned accordingly; Sadanandan Bhadran v. Madhavan
Sunil Kumar, AIR 1998 SC 3043.
(ii) A manager or any other person authorised by the company can represent it
during the course of legal proceedings before the court and file a complaint;
Salar Solvent Extractions Ltd. v. South India Viscose Ltd., (1994) 3 Crimes
295 (Mad).
(iii) The Magistrate while taking cognizance has to look into the question
whether the ingredients of an offence have been made out or not; M/s. Pearey
Lal Rajendra Kumar Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan, (1994) 3 Crimes 308 (Raj).
(iv) The cause of action for filing complaint would arise after the completion
of 15 days from the date the drawer receives the notice and fails to pay the
amount within that period; V.N. Samant v. M/s. K.G.N. Traders, (1994) 3 Crimes
725 (Karn).
(v) The payee cannot lodge a complaint after the completion of one month from
the date on which the cause of action arose as there is a bar under clause (b)
of section 142; V.N. Samant v. M/s. K.G.N. Traders, (1994) 3 Crimes 725
(Karn).
(vi) So long as the period of notice does not expire there can be no cause of
action with the payee to make the drawer liable criminally; T.K. Khungar v.
Sanjay Ghai, (1994) 3 Crimes 802 (P & H).
(vii) It is well settled that it is not necessary for the Magistrate to
specifically state that he is taking cognizance of the offence. If he takes
steps as provided under section 200, of the Code of Criminal Procedure then it
necessarily means that he has taken cognizance of the offence; R. Rajendra
Reddy v. M/s. Sujaya Feeds, (1994) 3 Crimes 692 (Karn).
(viii) The complainant must allege in his complaint that the cheque was
dishonoured due to want of sufficient amount in the account, even if the
payment was stopped; Ballakrishna Pillai v. Abdullakutty, (1994) 2 Crimes 327
(Ker).
(ix) Once a cause of action has arisen, the limitation will begun to run and
it could not be stopped by presenting the cheque again so as to have a fresh

(xi) When the cheque stood issued in favour of a company, a complaint under
section 138 of the Act can be filed by its Manager, Partner, Director or any
person authorised by the company; M/s. Ruby Leather Exports v. K. Venu, (1994)
1 Crimes 820 (Mad).
(xii) There is no ambiguity in clause (a) of section 142 of the Act, which
prohibits or excludes complaints being initiated by Power of Attorney, agents
of the payee or the holder in due course. A Power of Attorney, will be
competent to initiate a private complaint by stepping into the shoes of the
payee or the holder in due course; M/s. Ruby Leather Exports v. K. Venu,
(1994) 1 Crimes 820 (Mad).
THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT, 1881

(3) Every trial under this section shall be conducted as expeditiously as
possible and an endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six
months from the date of filing of the complaint.
