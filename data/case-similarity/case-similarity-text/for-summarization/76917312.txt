           CORAM:
not necessary to go into the aspect of Section 27 of the Contract Act raised
by Mr. Tripathi once the plaintiffs have not made their case on the main
issues at this prima facie stage.
14\. Under these circumstances, without expressing any opinion about the MoU
and subsequent conduct of the plaintiffs, at this stage, this Court is not
inclined to continue with the interim order rather to put the terms to the
defendants as the balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendants who
have allegedly invested Rs.17 crores on the establishment of the said project
and they have employed more than 150 employees in their factory. In case the
interim order will continue, the defendants would suffer irreparable loss and
injury. Under these circumstances, both applications are disposed of with
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 17 of 18 directions that the defendants shall
maintain true and correct statement of sale of the impugned goods and shall
file the statement every quarterly. The first statement of sale shall be filed
by 15th November, 2015 from the date of filing the suit till 31st October,
2015 and thereafter, the defendants shall file the same every quarterly till
           CORAM:
           HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MANMOHAN SINGH
    MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
1\. The plaintiff has filed the suit for declaration and permanent injunction.
The suit and interim application were listed before Court on 22nd September,
2015 while issuing the summons and notice, the interim order was passed
restraining the defendants and their servants from using the business of
Technical Agrochemicals like 2:4 D series, clodino etc., in terms of the MOU
dated 1st April, 2012.
2\. The defendants upon service of summons also filed an application under
Order 39 Rule 4 read with Section 151 CPC for vacation of ex-parte interim
injunction. The grounds taken in the application are same as stated in the
written statement. The plaintiffs CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 1 of 18 have filed
the reply to the said application and taken the same stand as taken in the
plaint and reiterated the averments made in the replication.
3\. Both the parties have made their submissions in the pending interim
applications. It would be appropriate to refer to the pleadings of the parties
in order to decide the interim applications.
4\. Brief facts of the case as per plaint are :
i) Anil Gupta, plaintiff No.1 and Kewal Sehgal, defendant No.1 were partners
in Ambey Laboratories (partnership firm) from the year 1977\. The above-named
Ambey Laboratories was engaged in manufacturing of fast moving consumer goods
like phenyl, naphthalene balls etc. under the brand name of Trishul.
ii) The plaintiff No.1 and defendant No.1 in order to do new business formed a
company namely Ambey Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., plaintiff No.2 Company in
pursuance of the Memorandum of Association dated 26th February, 1985 and
accordingly they agreed to take ten numbers of equity shares each in their
names.
iii) After the aforesaid memorandum and decision taken by the above said
parties, plaintiff No.2 Company on 20th March, 1985 got registered and
incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 which became a limited company in
the name and style of Ambey Laboratories Private Ltd.
iv) On 31st December, 2005, the licensing officer, Joint Director Agriculture,
Plant Protection, Rajasthan, Jaipur granted licence to the Ambey Laboratories
Pvt. Ltd. for various agrochemical CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 2 of 18 products,
the detailed list of the products has been attached with the plaint. On 15th
February, 2010 the Annual Sales Turnover of M/s Ambey Laboratories was
Rs.963.47 lakhs.
v) On 1st April, 2012 the Memorandum of Understanding between the plaintiff
No.1 and the defendant No.1 was signed. The important condition of separation
of business between the said parties is that plaintiff No.1 and his sons
Archit Gupta and Arpit Gupta will not indulge themselves in the business of
Phenyl and other products which were currently being manufactured by Ambey
Laboratories (partnership firm) and that the defendant No.1 and his son
Rakshit Sehgal, defendant No.2 would not indulge themselves in the business of
technical Agrochemicals like 2:4 D Series, Clodino etc. which was currently
being manufactured by plaintiff No.2 Company. The aforesaid Memorandum of
Understanding was valid upto the next 10 years w.e.f. 1st April, 2012 to 1st
April, 2022. The main aim of the Memorandum of Understanding is that no one
would violate the terms and conditions as agreed between the parties.
vi) The defendant Nos.1 and 2 after disassociation formed a new company in the
name and style of Agro Allied Ventures Pvt. Ltd., defendant No.3 and defendant
No.1 is the Director of the Company. It came to the notice of the plaintiffs
that the defendants have violated the terms and conditions of the Memorandum
of Understanding dated 1st April, 2012 and were manufacturing the products
which the defendants were not to manufacture in view of the terms and
conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding. The Retail Invoice/Cash CS(OS)
No.2892/2015 Page 3 of 18 Memo/Bill dated 9th May, 2015 of the defendant No.3
Company has been produced by the plaintiffs which would show that the
defendants have manufactured pesticides, insecticides, weedicides which is
contrary to the condition of MoU dated 1st April, 2012. The consignment
receipt of Associated Road Carriers Ltd. dated 7th May, 2015 would also reveal
that defendants have supplied those products to their customers. Besides this,
the Excise Invoice of Shanti Chemtrade Pvt. Ltd., Faridabad shows that
defendant No.3 Company purchased Caustic Soda (C), raw material for
manufacturing Agrochemicals and violated the terms and conditions of the
Memorandum of Understanding. The invoice is of 16th May, 2015. The Tax Invoice
dated 28th May, 2015 of Shanti Chemtrades Pvt. Ltd., Faridabad shows that the
defendants have also purchased Liquid Chloride for manufacturing
Agrochemicals.
vii) The plaintiffs and defendants entered into a dissolution deed dated 30th
September, 2012. According to the aforesaid dissolution deed the plaintiffs
and defendants were to follow certain terms and conditions but the defendants
have violated the terms and conditions as incorporated in the aforesaid
dissolution deed dated 30th September, 2012 as the ledger account of the Ambey
Laboratories since 1st April, 2012 to 31st March, 2013 shows that the debit of
the company is Rs.16,33,992.33/- and the credit of the company is also the
same. The ledger account of the Ambey Laboratories since 1st April, 2012 to
31st March, 2013 reveals that the opening balance, shares of plaintiff No.2
Company and Indian Overseas Bank is Rs. 28,85,30.00/- (debit) and credit of
the company is also the same.
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 4 of 18
viii) Defendant No.2 transferred his 46,500 equity shares of plaintiff No.2
Company to Ambey Capital Pvt. Ltd. as per the share transfer deed and share
certificates. Similarly, defendant No.1 also transferred 40,500 equity shares
of plaintiff No.2 Company to Ambey Capital Pvt. Ltd. as per the share transfer
deed and share certificates. Now, the defendants have no dues of any kind left
over with the plaintiffs.
ix) As the defendants are selling goods in the market, the plaintiffs have
suffered a loss in its business.
Therefore, the plaintiffs are seeking relief of injunction against the
defendants, inter alia, restraining the defendants from manufacturing and
supplying the agricultural products i.e. pesticides, insecticides, weedicides
and other agricultural products which the defendants have not to manufacture
and supplied that to his customers.
5\. Defence in the written statement on behalf of the defendants:
i) The plaintiffs have come to this Court with unclean hands and have filed
the suit on the basis of a forged and fabricated MOU dated 1st April, 2012,
which was never entered into or executed between the parties, nor does it bear
the genuine signature of defendant No.1. There was otherwise no occasion for
entering into any alleged MOU on 1st April, 2012, as the parties at that time
were still continuing with the partnership business and were associated in
plaintiff No.2 Company.
ii) On 1st September, 2012, a fresh partnership deed was executed between the
parties whereby defendant No.2 was inducted as a CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 5 of
18 partner and plaintiff No.1 continued as a partner in the said firm.
Thereafter it was only when defendant Nos. 1 and 2 bought plot No. SP3-7(B),
Keshwana Industrial Area, Kotputli, Rajasthan, that plaintiff No.1 enquired
from defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as to why and for what purpose the said plot was
purchased by defendant No.3, which was a company incorporated by defendant
Nos. 1 and 2. On that day, it was intimated to the plaintiffs by the
defendants that they were interested in setting up an independent plant for
the purpose of manufacture of Agro Chemicals including Technical Agrochemicals
like 2.4D series clodino etc as well as various formulation of agro chemical.
iii) On coming to know about the aforesaid fact the plaintiff expressed his
view that in case the defendants are setting up a new business, then the
defendants would not be able to devote sufficient time for the purpose of
business which was being carried on in partnership as well as in plaintiff
No.2 company and it was only after 20th September, 2012 that negotiations
started between the parties and it was decided that Ambey Laboratories would
be taken over by the defendants and while the plaintiff No.2 Company will be
taken over by the plaintiff No.1 and his group members and defendant Nos. 1
and 2 will do business in the name and style of defendant No.3. These
negotiations ultimately culminated into a settlement on 30th September, 2012
and a dissolution deed was executed between the plaintiff No.1 and defendant
Nos. 1 and 2 whereby plaintiff No.1 retired from Ambey Laboratories and was
paid back his money as was agreed to be paid under the dissolution deed.
Similarly, from November, 2012 onwards defendant Nos. 1 and 2 started
transferring their CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 6 of 18 shareholding in favour of
plaintiff No. 1 and his group members on the book value and thus, resigned
from the board of the said company after the transfer of the entire
shareholding. All negotiations regarding separation took place only after 20th
September, 2012 and prior to that there was never any inkling about retirement
or separation and therefore, there was no reason whatsoever for entering into
any MOU dated 1st April, 2012 which MOU has in fact been fabricated and forged
by the plaintiffs for the purpose of filing the present suit.
iv) It is submitted that plaintiff No. 1 has utilized one old letterhead,
which must be lying with the plaintiff No.1, for fabricating MOU dated 1st
April, 2012 as from 2008 onwards new letterhead of Ambey Laboratories were got
printed as the telephone number as well as email address of the said firm had
changed. It is submitted that new letterheads were in use as far back as 2008,
which fact can be appreciated from various letters on the said letterhead
signed by the plaintiff No.1 and filed with various government departments.
v) The plaintiffs have also forged the stamp of the firm. The stamp used by
the plaintiffs on the alleged MOU, was never used by the firm. The font of the
letters used in the stamp on the alleged MOU is different from the original
stamp of the firm which contains capital letters in the name of Ambey
Laboratories. The said MOU also does not bear the genuine signature of
defendant No.1. The same is done by the plaintiffs only in order to create a
false evidence for the purpose of the present suit, whereas, as a matter of
fact, there was no occasion for entering into any such CS(OS) No.2892/2015
Page 7 of 18 arrangement between the parties as it was known to the plaintiffs
since September 2012 that the defendants were going to set up a separate unit
for manufacture of Agro Chemicals including Technical Agrochemicals like 2.4D
series clodino etc as well as various formulation of agro chemical as
mentioned above.
vi) The defendants invested Rs. 17 crores on the establishment of the said
project. When the defendants transferred their shareholding in favour of
plaintiffs, it was always in the knowledge of the plaintiffs that the
defendants have applied for various licences required for manufacture of such
type of items and the defendants were spending huge amount for establishment
of their new unit for manufacture of Agro Chemicals including Technical
Agrochemicals like 2.4D series clodino etc as well as various formulation of
agro chemical. The plaintiffs never raised any objection to the same at any
time, except by means of the present suit only when the plaintiffs found that
the goods being manufactured by the defendants are of much superior quality
than the quality of goods manufactured by the plaintiffs.
vii) There was no embargo for the plaintiff to carry on business of Phenyl
which was being manufactured by Ambey Laboratories, except that the trademark
Trishul, under which Ambey Laboratories were manufacturing Phenyl and allied
items, cannot be used by the plaintiffs. The said MOU dated 1st April, 2012 is
forged and fabricated and even otherwise the same is hit by Section 27 of the
Contract Act. The restrictions on trade are otherwise unreasonable and unfair
and cannot be imposed upon the defendants and are not enforceable in law. Even
otherwise CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 8 of 18 there are many other manufacturers
who are manufacturing Agro Chemicals including Technical Agrochemicals like
2.4D series clodino etc as well as various formulation of agro chemical and as
such the plaintiffs cannot claim any monopoly in the same, nor can seek any
relief in this regard.
viii) It is submitted that defendant Nos.1 and 2 have transferred shareholding
in the company which is a private limited Company and have not received any
money, except the price of those shares at book value.
6\. Replication filed on behalf of the plaintiffs
i) It is denied by the plaintiffs that the signature of the defendant No.1 is
not a genuine signature. It is submitted that the signature of the defendant
No.1 on MoU dated 1st April, 2012 is his genuine Signature which can be proved
by other signatures on the other documents. The report of the handwriting
expert which has been filed along with the written statement is denied.
ii) The plaintiffs have enclosed few documents with the replication in order
to show that the defendant No.1 has signed and his signatures do not match
with each other as there are variation in signature of the defendant No.1
which can be verified.
iii) It is submitted that there has never been instance or occasions wherein
the parties to the suit have discarded old letter heads for new ones. The
plaintiffs used those letter heads which have always used whatever was
available with them. There are many stamps in the firm. The stamp of the
company which is used in the MOU is correct.
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 9 of 18
iv) It is denied that discussion for separation started only after 1st
September, 2012. Before finalizing the MOU, number of meetings were held in
Maurya Shereton Hotel and thereafter, MOU was signed on 1st April, 2012 and in
order to execute the MOU the salary of defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 were
not released from plaintiff No.2 Company from April 2012 and no TDS was
deducted which was being done from the day of salary distribution to Directors
started. The plaintiff No.1 did not withdraw any salary and profit from Ambey
Laboratories since 1st April, 2012. The shares of plaintiff No.2 Company held
by Ambey Laboratories were transferred from plaintiff No.1's capital amount in
Ambey Laboratories to plaintiff No.1 as payment of the capital deployed in
Ambey Laboratories. The aforesaid transaction was executed on 2nd April, 2012.
The certified copies of the C.A. as well as the letter signed by defendant
No.1 has been placed on record. The book value on which the shares were
transferred is calculated upto 31st March, 2012. As a part of execution the
parties had to reconstitute the partnership deed in Ambey Laboratories for
which the stamp paper No.IN DL10761879013238k was purchased on 5th August,
2012 at 2:59 P.M. post adding a new partner a resolution deed was to be
executed for which the stamp papers were purchased at the same time vide stamp
paper No. INDL1076168662065K on 5 th August, 2012 at 2:57 P.M. The description
of documents mentioned in the aforesaid stamp paper is 'Article 64(b)
dissolution deed'. The balance sheet of 2009-10 and 2010-11 were signed by the
defendants and plaintiffs jointly post signing of MOU the balance sheet of
2012 was duly signed by the plaintiffs' family only.
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 10 of 18
v) The suppliers are common and they have provided the bills to the plaintiffs
vide email dated 13th June, 2015 at 4:11 P.M. to Ms. Sangeeta Sharma, G.M.
Purchase Ambey Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. providing the information of bills, the
transportation bills of Associated Road Carrier were received on whatsapp from
one Mr. Sanjay, employee of the aforesaid transport company to Mr. Nitin
Gupta. Ambey Allied Ventures Pvt. Ltd., the defendant No.3 was incorporated on
24th May, 2011 and their MOA does not state any mention of manufacturing of
pesticides. It was only after the MOU dated 1st April, 2012 they purchased the
land and changed the name from Ambey to Agro Allied Venture Pvt. Ltd. on 5 th
June, 2012\. Therefore, it is mentioned that the discussions were started
earlier after execution of MoU.
7\. Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel has made his submissions which
are outlined as under :-
i. Firstly he says that the MoU is forged and fabricated document. In support,
he referred para 2 and 3 of the preliminary objections. Mr. Tripathi submits
that from the year 2008 onwards new letter-head of M/s. Ambay Laboratories
were printed as the telephone number as well as email address of the said firm
had changed. The MoU is fabricated by the plaintiff on the old letter-head
which were not in existence in the year 2012.
ii. Secondly, Mr. Tripathi says that it is the case of the plaintiffs that MoU
is the most vital document which divides the business of the parties with
regard to the nature of the description of the goods however by mutual consent
when the CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 11 of 18 dissolution deed was executed
parties, the plaintiff No.1 himself had agreed in clause 3 of the agreement to
the effect that the continuing partners defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 may
use the name and style of 'AMBEY LABORATORIES' to carry on business of the
firm or any other business as they may desire. If the said document was a
vital document as claimed by the plaintiffs which was in their possession at
the time of execution of deed, then why the defendants were allowed to carry
on business of the firm or any other business as they may desire. The
plaintiff would not have allowed any other business if the MOU was a genuine
document and the same was executed by the defendants rather the plaintiff No.1
would have insisted for including the terms of MoU.
iii. Thirdly, Mr. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel submits that as a matter of
fact, the plaintiffs on the date of filing of suit had full knowledge about
the said clause 3 of the dissolution deed where the consent was given,
therefore the plaintiffs intentionally and deliberately did not file the copy
of dissolution deed dated 30th September, 2012 in order to obtain ex-parte ad-
interim order.
iv. Lastly and fourthly, it is submitted by Mr. Tripathi that the clause 3 of
the deed itself allowed to carry out business of any nature of business, even
otherwise MoU referred the conditions and the said restrictions imposed is hit
by Section 27 of the Contract Act. The defendants are entitled to deal with
such goods which were restrained by this Court irrespective of MoU or no MoU.
He says that his clients have CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 12 of 18 no objection
even if the plaintiffs may also deal with all description of goods including
2:4 D series clodino. Pertaining to the issue raised by the plaintiffs to
goodwill is concerned, it is stated that defendants also transferred
shareholding in favour of the plaintiffs company without receiving any money
except the price of these shares at book value.
8\. Mr.Rajiv Nayar, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiffs in the submission submitted that the MoU is a genuine document
which is duly signed by defendant No. 1 who has been signing papers in the
course of business in different manner from time to time. He also referred the
hand written expert report in support of the case of plaintiffs. He argues
that MoU defines the clauses of division of the description of goods and even
otherwise after execution of said MoU, both parties were taking various steps
for the purpose of division of business as well as description of goods and as
consent of parties the requisite papers of dissolution deed were signed. He
denied the report of hand writing expert filed on behalf of the defendants. He
says that since goodwill of the trademark Trishul is assigned to the
defendants, the said MoU cannot be offended under Section 27 of Contract Act.
Lastly, it is submitted by him that the original MoU is being produced in the
Court and the same be kept on record. His clients have no objection if the
same is sent to FSL at Hyderabad and until the report is received, the interim
report should continue against the defendants. He has referred the following
decisions in support of his submission on the objection raised by Mr. Tripathi
under Section 27 of the Contract Act.

ii) Ozone Spa Private Limited vs. Pure Fitness & Ors., 2015 (63) PTC 505
(Del.)
9\. It is the admitted position that when the interim order was passed, copy
of the dissolution deed was not filed although reference about the same was
mentioned in the plaint. Clause 3 of the said agreement allows the defendants
to carry on business of the firm or any other business as the defendant may
desire. Factum of the same has not been denied by the plaintiffs, who have
also not denied that there is no reference about MOU in the deed of
dissolution executed between the parties after the date of MoU.
10\. The defendants have denied having executed the said document. Both
parties have relied upon their hand writing experts' reports. It is difficult
for the Court to give its opinion about the documents by comparing the
signatures. The findings of the two reports are contrary to each other. At
this stage only prime-facie view is to be taken on the basis of material
placed on record and the conduct of the parties during the relevant period of
time. However, one thing is clear that one of the parties is making incorrect
statement in its pleadings and arguments.
11\. At the time of passing the interim order, photocopy of the MoU was
placed. The original MoU was produced before Court on 16th October, 2015. The
scanned copy of the original MoU is reproduced herein below:-
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 14 of 18
From the original document it is evident that the said document is also signed
by two witnesses, but in the photocopy of the same the entire details of
witnesses are missing which was filed along with the plaint.
12\. Secondly, it is the case of the defendants that the letter-head of Ambey
Laboratories as appeared and filed in Court was changed from 2008 onwards and
new letterhead of Ambey Laboratories were got printed as the telephone number
as well as e-mail address of the said firm had changed. It was submitted on
behalf of the plaintiffs that even old letter head was being used by the
parties in 2012. But the said statement is not supported by any back-up
evidence. Out of many documents one of them is of July, 2008, it would reveal
the new telephone numbers and e-mail address. Admittedly, during the course
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 15 of 18 of business when parties were jointly
carrying on business, M/s.Ambey Laboratories issued the letter dated 8th July,
2008 to the Deputy Director (Mark) Bureau of Indian Standards for issuance of
renewal of License No. 1106324 for the year 2009-10, the said letter-head
issued by the said firm contained the details of new telephone numbers and
e-mail address. Scanned copy of the said letter is reproduced herein below :
From the above it is clear that new telephone numbers and e- mail address were
mentioned. MoU typed in the letterhead relied CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 16 of
18 upon by the plaintiffs of the year 2012 contained old details. It is also
pertinent to mention that the letter issued in July, 2008 was received by the
Government Office against its stamp.
13\. Thirdly, when the dissolution deed was executed, the factum of MoU was
not mentioned which was allegedly in the possession of the plaintiffs. In
case, the defendant No.1 had already surrendered his rights by not indulging
in the business of Technical Agrochemicals like 2:4 D series, clodino etc. one
would be surprised why the same was incorporated in the dissolution deed which
was executed at the later stage rather as per Clause 3 of the dissolution
deed, the defendants were allowed to carry on other business as the defendants
desired. Further, why the plaintiffs did not file the dissolution deed along
with the plaint. The decisions referred by the plaintiffs' counsel do not help
the case of the plaintiffs under these circumstances and the situation and
facts in the present matter are materially different. Even otherwise, it is
not necessary to go into the aspect of Section 27 of the Contract Act raised
by Mr. Tripathi once the plaintiffs have not made their case on the main
issues at this prima facie stage.
14\. Under these circumstances, without expressing any opinion about the MoU
and subsequent conduct of the plaintiffs, at this stage, this Court is not
inclined to continue with the interim order rather to put the terms to the
defendants as the balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendants who
have allegedly invested Rs.17 crores on the establishment of the said project
and they have employed more than 150 employees in their factory. In case the
interim order will continue, the defendants would suffer irreparable loss and
injury. Under these circumstances, both applications are disposed of with
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 17 of 18 directions that the defendants shall
maintain true and correct statement of sale of the impugned goods and shall
file the statement every quarterly. The first statement of sale shall be filed
by 15th November, 2015 from the date of filing the suit till 31st October,
2015 and thereafter, the defendants shall file the same every quarterly till
the final decision of the suit. The interim order passed on 22nd September,
2015, in view of the above said terms and conditions, is vacated.
15\. Both applications are disposed of accordingly.

1\. The plaintiff has filed the suit for declaration and permanent injunction.
The suit and interim application were listed before Court on 22nd September,
2015 while issuing the summons and notice, the interim order was passed
restraining the defendants and their servants from using the business of
Technical Agrochemicals like 2:4 D series, clodino etc., in terms of the MOU
dated 1st April, 2012.
2\. The defendants upon service of summons also filed an application under
Order 39 Rule 4 read with Section 151 CPC for vacation of ex-parte interim
injunction. The grounds taken in the application are same as stated in the
written statement. The plaintiffs CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 1 of 18 have filed
the reply to the said application and taken the same stand as taken in the
plaint and reiterated the averments made in the replication.
3\. Both the parties have made their submissions in the pending interim
applications. It would be appropriate to refer to the pleadings of the parties
in order to decide the interim applications.
4\. Brief facts of the case as per plaint are :
i) Anil Gupta, plaintiff No.1 and Kewal Sehgal, defendant No.1 were partners
not necessary to go into the aspect of Section 27 of the Contract Act raised
by Mr. Tripathi once the plaintiffs have not made their case on the main
issues at this prima facie stage.
14\. Under these circumstances, without expressing any opinion about the MoU
and subsequent conduct of the plaintiffs, at this stage, this Court is not
inclined to continue with the interim order rather to put the terms to the
defendants as the balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendants who
have allegedly invested Rs.17 crores on the establishment of the said project
and they have employed more than 150 employees in their factory. In case the
interim order will continue, the defendants would suffer irreparable loss and
injury. Under these circumstances, both applications are disposed of with
CS(OS) No.2892/2015 Page 17 of 18 directions that the defendants shall
maintain true and correct statement of sale of the impugned goods and shall
file the statement every quarterly. The first statement of sale shall be filed
by 15th November, 2015 from the date of filing the suit till 31st October,
2015 and thereafter, the defendants shall file the same every quarterly till
           CORAM:
