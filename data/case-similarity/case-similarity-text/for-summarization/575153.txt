Bench: P Mohanarajan, J S Reddy
ORDER J. Sudhakar Reddy, Accountant Member
1\. All these appeals are filed by the revenue directed against separate but
identical orders of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-IV, Bangalore. As the
issues arising out of these appeals are common, for the sake of convenience
they are heard together and disposed off by way of this common order.
2\. Facts in brief:
The assessee is a private company engaged in the business of prospecting and
mining for diamonds and other minerals. A brief note on the activities of this
company are narrated below for better understanding of the issues that arise
in these appeals.
3\. Exploration for diamonds is a challenging task as it amounts to "looking
for needles in hay stacks". Diamonds occur in very low concentrations, even in
economic diamond mines. Mining grades of diamond pipes are usually about 0.5
to 1 carat per tonne, which is equivalent to 0.5 to 1 part per million (one
carat = 0.2 gram, or 5 grams to the carat). Diamond exploration is carried out
technical design".
(Emphasis own)
33\. The word used in the above definition is "and" and not "or". Where
certain provisions are separated by the use of conjunction 'and', those
provisions are to be read cojointly. Where the intention of the legislature is
clear, 'and' may be read as 'or' even though the result is less favourable to
the subject. The use of 'conjunctive' and the disconjunctive or', one for the
other, is permissible where liberal interpretation would be the intention of
the legislature or the object of the act. In the present context the words
'development' and transfer' should be read cqjointly.
34\. As per para 1.1.5 of Agreement between 'De Beers' and 'Fugro', the
ownership of all information and data was always with 'De Beers' and 'Fugro'
is bound by confidential clause. When the ownership of data is always with 'De
Beers', there cannot be transfer of property from 'Fugro' to 'De Beers'.
'Fugro' has not developed or transferred any technical plan or design to 'De
Beers' so as to attract Article 12(5)(b) of the India and Netherlands DTAA.
carat = 0.2 gram, or 5 grams to the carat). Diamond exploration is carried out
in a variety of ways, depending upon the location and the type of diamond
deposit sought. Exploration over a large area can be carried out by sampling
the streams or loam sampling the surface soils looking for indicator minerals
or by geophysical methods where surface sampling would not be effective
exploration tool or would be too expensive.
4\. Regional diamond exploration entails the search over hundreds of square
kilometers (or miles) seeking an economic diamond deposit. The manner in which
this exploration is carried out depends upon the surface geology and
topography of the area to be explored. Where there is good stream development,
usually in hilly or undulating terrain, the main exploration method has been
by sampling the stream sediments for "kimberlitic Indicator Minerals" (KIM).
These KIM are special minerals that occur in kimberlite and lamprolite and due
to their high specific gravity, tend to be concentrated in "trap sites" along
with other heavy minerals (e.g.gold, tin, sapphires). Stream sampling can
yield a larger array of KIM including pyrope granet, picrolimenite, chrome
diopside and chromite. Diamond is rarely recovered during the regional
exploration sampling of an area.
5\. In areas where the streams are poorly developed, or non-existent, two
regional exploration methods can be employed. The first is loam sampling and
the other is geophysical exploration. Loam sampling comprises the collection
of samples of the surface soil, usually about a 1 cm. thick surface scrape,
where wind action has concentrated the heavy minerals into a lag layer.
Samples can be collected on large, usually square, grids with a sample spacing
of 1,2,3 or 4 km. between samples.
6\. Geophysical exploration in regional diamond exploration has mainly been by
airborne magnetic(aeromagnetic) and Electro Magnetic (aero EM) surveys but
additional technologies, such as airborne gravity meters are also beginning to
be used. In aeromagnetic surveys, an aircraft flies along lines spaced about
200 to 400 m apart, depending upon the area and the survey requirements. The
data collected along these "flight lines" is then processed by a geophysicist
and "anomalies" are identified. If these magnetic or EM anomalies cannot be
explained by obvious surface features, like wind pumps or buildings, then
these anomalies will be examined in more detail to see if they may represent a
kimberlite pipe. If the geophysicist considers that the anomaly may have been
caused by a pipe, then usually more detailed magnetic surveys are done over
the magnetic "target".
7\. De Beers India Exploration is in the business of prospecting of minerals.
De Beers has been granted licences (Reconnaissance Permits) by the State
Government of Karnataka, Andra Pradesh and Chattisgarh for mineral
reconnaissance activities. Reconnaisance is the early stage of exploration.
During the early stage various techniques are employed like:
i). Collection of Steam Samples
ii). Geophysical Survey like the AMS(Airborne Multispectral Scanner Survey).
EM Survey (Electro Magnetic Survey), Mag Survey etc. Exploration has various
stages like:
i). The Early Stage - initially for a period of 3-5 years.
ii). Advanced stage for a period of 5-10 years
iii). Feasibility stage 5-10 years.
On an average the time taken from a discovery to production is eight years.
8\. For the purposes of carrying out geophysical survey, De Beers India
Minerals Pvt. Ltd. (herein after referred as 'De Beers'), the assessee company
entered into an agreement with M/s. Fugro Elbocon B.V. Netherlands
(hereinafter referred to as 'Fugro'). "Fugro" had a team of experts who
specialized in performing air borne geophysical services for clients, process
the data acquired during the survey and provide necessary reports. The
services are engaged to conduct the air borne survey for providing high
quality, high resolution, geophysical data suitable for selecting probable
kimberlite targets. The important points that emerge from the agreement are as
follows:
i) 'Fugro' conducted the airborne survey using its specialized equipment.
ii) The helicopter for the survey was hired by 'De Beers',
iii) All the logistics of the survey, such as flight schedule, re-flights
survey lines, control lines, positioning etc were set by 'Fugro'.
iv) 'Fugro' deputed technical personnel for conducting the survey and
v) The data collected from the survey was provided to 'De Beers' in a
particular format which is called the Acquisition and Processing Report.
9\. The Assessing Officer treated the consideration paid Fugro under the
agreement as falling within the definition of 'fees for technical services'
under the Article 12 of the Indo-Netherlands Double Tax Avoidance Agreement
(DTAA) read with Section 90 of the Act. Alternatively, he has also held that
the payment in question was for development and transfer of a technical plan
or technical design. Thus he held that the assessee had failed to deduct tax
on the payments made to 'Fugro' and hence treated the assessee deductor as an
assessee in default. He levied tax under Section 201(1) and interest under
Section 201(1A) for all the three assessment years. Aggrieved the assessee
carried the matter in appeal.
10\. The first appellate authority held that the services rendered by 'Fugro'
to De Beers and the payments made for it are not covered by Article 12(5) of
the DTAA between India and Netherlands. He held that 'Fugro' is not imparted
any technology to De Beers and that they have just used the technology and
have gone back with the same. He also observed that in future if 'De Beers'
required geological survey of a different area, they will have to engage the
services of technical expertise like 'Fugro' again. He concluded that no
technology has been made available to 'De Beers' by 'Fugro' and therefore the
consideration paid does not fall within the definition of Article 12(5) of
DTAA between India and Netherlands.
11\. On the issue whether the payment was for the development and transfer of
a technical plan or a technical design, learned first appellate authority held
that it cannot be described as plan or design and it was only raw data that
was supplied. He also observed that the argument relating to the ownership
data also has merit. Thus he upheld the contention of the assessee that no tax
was deductible on the payments made to 'Fugro'. Aggrieved the revenue is in
appeal on the following effective grounds:
The learned CIT(A) has failed to appreciate that the payment made to the non-
resident towards conducting airborne surveys for providing high quality, high
resolution geophysical data suitable for selecting probable kimberlite
targets, is income liable to be taxed as per Article 12 of the DTAA (between
India and The Netherlands).
The CFT(A) has erred in holding that only the data has been supplied and no
plan or design has been supplied. Further, the CIT(A) has held that Maps
cannot be described as plan or designs. In this regard reliance is placed on a
decision of Supreme Court reported in 253 ITR 274 in the case of Commissioner
of Custom v. Parasrampuria Synthetics Ltd.
The learned CIT(A) erred in holding that the nonresident company has supplied
only raw data. The CFT(A) failed to appreciate the objective of the agreement
which is to get 'suitable data', as per the agreement. Further, the specially
developed equipment is meant to collect & process the data towards a
particular end.
12\. Shri B. Chattaraj, learned Departmental Representative argued on behalf
of revenue and Shri K.R. Shekar, learned Counsel represented the assessee. Mr.
Chattaraj supported the order of the Assessing Officer whereas Mr. K.R. Shekar
relied on the order of the CIT(A). The assessee filed a paper book consisting
of Annexures 1 to 13. Shri B. Chattaraj submitted that, the nature of services
rendered are professional services under Article 12 of the Indo-Netherlands
DTAA and alternatively it was for the transfer of a technical plan or design
and thus tax should have been deducted at source. Shri K.R. Shekar submitted
that the payments may be business profits under the DTAA but not payments of
fees for technical services as contemplated under DTAA. Both parties argued at
length in support of their respective contentions.
13\. We have carefully considered the rival submissions and have perused the
papers on record as well as the case laws cited. The undisputed fact in this
case is that the "Fugro" does not have a permanent establishment in India. It
is also not. in dispute that the payment in question falls under the term
'technical services' as defined in Section 9(1)(vii) of the Income Tax Act,
1961. It is also not in dispute that Section 90 of the I.T. Act comes into
play and that the taxability of the payment in question is based on the
applicability of Article 12(5) Sub-clause (b) of the DTAA between India and
Netherlands. The Sub-clause (b) in Article 12(5) of the DTAA which is relevant
is extracted below:
Article 12: Royalties and Fees for Technical Services:
Payments of any account made to any person in consideration to the rendering
of services of any technical persons of consultancy nature (including the
provision of services for technical and other), if such services are.
1 ...
2 ...
3 ...
4 ...
5\. For purposes of this Article, [fees for technical services' means payments
of any kind to any, person in consideration for the rendering of any technical
or consultancy services (including through the provisionof services of
technical or other personnel) if such services:
a) are ancillary and subsidiary to the application or enjoyment of the right,
property or information for which a payment described in paragraph 4 of this
Article is received; or
b) make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know how of process,
or development as transferred by a technical plan or a technical design
(Emphasis ours) Both the parties before us have not disputed the fact that the
Indo-Netherlands DTAA are on the same lines as the DTAA between India and USA.
In fact, the protocol to the DTAA signed between the parties, states that the
memorandum of understanding between India and USA would apply mutandis
mutandis to Article 12 of the Indo-Netherlands DTAA (Ref. Notification S.O.
693(E) Dt.30.8.1999).
14\. On these facts and circumstances of the case, we formulate the following
question for consideration:
(a) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the payments made by
the assessee company "De Beers" to "Fugro", for services rendered by them can
be said to be a payment for "fees for technical services" within the meaning
of Article 12(5)(b) of the DTAA between India and Netherlands?
15\. The main question can be, for convenience sub-divided as follows:
a) Whether 'Fugro' has made available technical knowledge, experience, skill,
know-how or process to 'De Beers'.
b) Whether payment to 'Fugro' was for the development and transfer of a
technical plan or technical design to 'De Beers'.
The legal position on the first sub-question is by now well settled. In the
case of C.E.S.C. Ltd. v. DCIT 87 ITD 653 (Kol), Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,
the Kolkata 'C Bench at pages 675 to 684 at paragraph Nos.9 to 18 have
considered the matter at length. The example given in the Memorandum of
Understanding between India and USA which would apply mutandis mutandis to the
case on hand, have been extracted and considered in this decision and the
learned 3rd Member concluded as follows:
Paragraph 4(b) of Article 12 refers to technical or consultancy services that
make available to the person acquiring the services technical knowledge,
experience, skill, know-how or processes, or consist of the development and
transfer of a technical plan or technical design to such person. (For this
purpose the person acquiring the service shall be deemed to include an agent,
nominee or transferee of such person). This category is narrower than the
category described in paragraph 4(a) because it excludes any person acquiring
the service. Generally speaking, technology will be considered made available
when the person acquiring the service is enabled to apply the technology. The
fact that the provision of the service may require technical input by the
person providing the service does not per se mean that technical knowledge,
skill etc. are made available to the person purchasing the service, within the
meaning of paragraph 4(b). Similarly the use of a product which embodies
technology shall not per se be considered to make the technology available.
(Emphasis supplied) At para 17, it was held as follows:
On perusal of Memorandum of Understanding concerning 'fee for included
services' in Article 12 appended to the DTAA between India and USA with the
help of the examples, it becomes abundantly clear that the technology would be
considered made available when the person acquiring the service is enabled to
apply the technology. The mere fact that the provision of the service may
require technical input by the person providing the service does not per se
mean that technical knowledge, skill, etc. are made available to the person
purchasing the service, within the meaning of Article 12, para 4(b) of DTAA
between India and U.K.
16\. In the case of Raymond Limited v. DCIT 80 TTJ 120
(a) it was held that mere rendering a service is not included unless the
person utilizing the service is able to make use of technical knowledge, etc,
by himself in his business or for his own benefit and without recourse to the
performer by the services, in future.
(b) There should be a transmission of technical knowledge, experience, skill,
etc from the person rendering the services to the person utilising the same.
17\. In the case of Nqa Quality System Registrar Limited v. DCIT 92 TTJ 946,
the Tribunal discussed the clause "make available" and held that when the same
is used, if technology is transferred through the technical service then alone
it is taxable. Using technical input in order to provide consultancy service
will not amount to making available technical knowledge, skill, expertise or
know-how.
18\. In the case of Meakens & Phyllips v. ACIT (International Taxation) 287
ITR 227 (AT) (Mumbai), it was held that when there was no material to suggest
that the payment was for any services which enable the recipients of those
services to apply the technology itself, it cannot, be concluded that the
consideration paid for such consultancy services was taxable in India under
Article 12(4)(b) as included services under the DTAA.
19\. Thus with these precedents on the interpretation of the term 'made
available', we examine the terms of contract between 'De Beers' and 'Fugro'.
The following clauses which are relevant are extracted from "The Agreement for
Geophysical Survey" between 'De Beers' and 'Fugro':
I. General conditions:
Clause 1.3: The Contractor shall perform and execute all work and services
required pursuant to this survey in a professional and work manlike manner,
and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, acts and notices of
any Federal, Provincial, territorial or local government or any agency
thereof.
Clause 1.15: All information and data to any site on which any work or
services are performed under the Agreement (collectively "information") shall
belong exclusively to the Client and its assigns and the contractor shall keep
such information strictly confidential. All information recorded in digital
and analog form and all products derived from information are the property of
the Client. The Contractor agrees (i) not to divulge any information to any
person or organization without the written permission of the Client personnel
who are specified by the Client as appropriate persons to whom the Contractor
may provide information.
II. Objective The objective of the survey will be to provide high quality,
high-resolution geophysical data suitable for selecting probable kimberlite
targets.
It is understood that the 100m line spacing data will be used to identify
anomalies and position exploration drill holes. The integrity of the
positional (both horizontal and vertical) information is vital.
The Client acknowledges the Contractor to be an expert in all aspects of the
airborne survey and subsequent data processing. It is thus accepted that all
the operations, tests and calibrations will be carefully undertaken to ensure
the highest possible data quality and to meet or exceed the specifications
described in this Agreement. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to
take the appropriate action to maintain the level of data quality.
Furthermore, it is understood that the logistical operation of he survey (that
is flight planning, fuel requirements etc.) is the responsibility of the
Contractor unless expressly stated otherwise in this Contract. The Client will
provide logistical support where applicable and when mutually agreed upon in
writing with the contractor (either within the contract or as an addendum to
it).
III. Final Products:
Within 30 days following delivery of preliminary products the following
nrnducts will be made available to the Client:
             Final Products                 Media                 Quantity
         All analog flight records            Paper                    1
      Flight logs (Flight to be            Digital                  1
      included in digital form along
      with final report)
      Final Data Archive as specified      Digital                  5
      in Appendix 12.2
      Black and White contour maps         Paper                    5
      of magnetics as specified in
      Appendix 12.3
      Black and White Contour              Paper                    5
      maps of themed frequency co-
      planner resistively as specified
      in Appendix 12.3
      Final report (includes as            Report                   5
      appendices, Tests and Digital
      Calibration report, Logistics
      Report)   
It is imperative that the Final Data be fully checked and validated before
shipment to the Client. The Client will return all data without further QC
procedures if errors are found due to improper checking by the Contractor.
IV. Payment Schedule:
      On Agreement Signing                         10.0% of estimated Costs.
    On mobilization                              Mobilisation cost
    On first successful flight                   30% of estimated cost
    On completion of flying and                  30% of estimated cost
    accepting the digital data
    On delivery of final products                Outstanding balance
    20. A perusal of these clauses show that.
    a) The consideration paid under the agreement to 'Fugro' was essential for providing specific data for which 'Fugro' was required to conduct the air borne survey.
    b) The technicians from Fugro have conducted the survey, as per the survey specifications by flying on a helicopter hired by De Beers.
c) The specialized equipment, technicians, technical knowledge and other
intangibles were always owned by Fugro and have never been transferred or
imparted to De Beers. De Beers is not in a position to utilize the specialized
equipment or technical knowledge.
d) All the logistics of the survey such as flight schedule, re-flights, base
stations, survey lines, contour lines, positioning etc. was set by Fugro
according to its own technical expertise.
e) All the information and data on any site on which survey was performed in
accordance with the agreement, exclusively belonged to 'De Beers' and 'Fugro'
is bound by confidentiality contract clause. All information recorded in
digital or analog formats and all products derived from information are the
property of 'De Beers' to the exclusion of 'Fugro'.
21\. On an application of these facts to the propositions already culled out
above, we have no hesitation whatsoever, in upholding the findings of the
first appellate authority that the payment in question for the services
rendered would not fall within the term 'fees for technical services' under
Article 12(5) of the India and Netherlands DTAA. 'Fugro' has surveyed,
collected and processed the data on behalf of De Beers. There is no doubt that
'Fugro' performed the services using substantial knowledge and expertise but
such technical experience, skill or knowledge has not been made available to
'De Beers',
22\. As already stated, as per the protocol signed between India and
Netherlands, the Memorandum of Understanding entered into between India and
USA would apply mutandis mutandis to Article 12 of Indo-Netherlands DTAA.
Example 7 given in the Memorandum of Understanding between India and USA is
relevant and is extracted below for ready reference:
Example 7 Facts:
The Indian vegetable oil manufacturing firm has mastered the science of
producing cholesterol-free oil and wishes to market the product world-wide. It
hires an American Marketing consulting firm to do a computer stimulation of
the world market for such oil and to advice it on marketing strategies. Are
the fees paid to the US company for included services?
Analysis:
The fees would not be for included services. The American company is providing
a consultancy service which involves the use of substantial technical skill
and expertise. It is not, however, making available to the Indian Company any
technical experience, knowledge or skill etc. Nor is it transferring a
technical plan or design. What is transferred to the Indian company through
the service contract is commercial information. The fact that technical skills
were required by the performer of the service in order to perform the
commercial information service does not make the service a technical service
within the meaning of paragraph 4(b).
23\. Mr. K.R. Shekar has also quoted an example during the course of his
arguments which we feel is relevant and applicable to this case. When a
patient visits a Doctor and the Doctor advise him to undergo various tests.
The patient does so. In the course of performing the scan tests, the scan
center used certain equipment. The scan center is actually provided the
service. The patient, is interested in the end result i.e. report of the test
and not in the technical know-how that is used in the scan report. Such
technical knowledge is not passed on to the patient. If the patient requires
the scan report again, he would require to get the report done once again and
he cannot do it by himself. Technical skill, knowledge, know-how or experience
is not passed on, though it is utilized in preparing the report.
24\. Thus we concur with the findings of the first appellate authority and
answer the first sub-question in favour of the assessee and against the
revenue by holding that the payment made for 'fees for technical services'
does not fall within the ken of Article 12(5)(b) of DTAA between India and
Netherlands, for the reason that 'Fugro' has not made available technical
knowledge, experience, skill, know-how or process to 'De Beers' while
providing the service. Thus, this question is answered in the negative in
favour of the assessee and against the revenue.
25\. Now we come to the second question. Before we go into the issue, we dwell
on the meaning of the words 'design, plan and technical':
The term 'Plan' has been defined in Advanced Law Lexicon as:
A plan is a design, a delineation, or projection on a plane surface of a
structure, which is reduced in size, the relative position of which, and the
proportions, being preserved.
A plan is a draft or form of representation of a horizontal section of
anything, as of building or machinery. Its synonyms are "draft",
"delineation", "sketch" and "design".
Design:
The term 'design' mean 'features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament
applied to any article and appealing to and not dictated solely by the
function the article has to perform, copyright may be obtained on registration
for new and original designs' - Great Encyclopaedic Dictionary, Vol.III page
1168.
26\. The Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Customs v. Parasrampuria
Synthetics Ltd. 2002-(253)-ITR-0274-SC, has analysed the meaning of plan and
design as follows:
Let us first analyse as to the true grammatical meaning of the words included
in serial No. 15 to wit: "plan, drawings and designs", "plan" in common
acceptation means "a drawing or diagram made by projections on horizontal
plane". The Law Lexicon attributes it to be a design or a sketch and is a
draft or form of representation and its synonyms are sketch and design. Corpus
Juris Secundum (vol.70) attributes a meaning in similar vein as "a draft or
form of representation of a horizontal section of anything, as of machinery; a
map...a scheme; a project; also a method of action, procedure or arrangement."
Expression, viz., "design" in popular parlance is used as a synonym with plan
and includes a sketch. Some times it has also been held to be synonymous with
"figure". The expression "design" has within its ambit many facets including a
criminal design which connotes an evil desire. Obviously the exemption
notification can not possible mean and imply a meaning which can be attributed
to be an evil one.
The three words "plan, drawing and design" however, convey more or less a
common attribution and identical meaning....
27\. The term "design" in the Advanced Law Lexicon has been defined to mean:
Design means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament
applied to any article by any industrial process or means, whether manual,
mechanical or chemical, separate or combined, which in the financial article
appeal to and are judged solely by the eye; but does not include any mode or
principle of construction or anything which is in substance a mere mechanical,
and does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of Sub-section
(1) of Section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, or propriety
mark as defined in Section 479 of the Indian Penal Code, A plan or scheme
conceived in the mind of something to be done; a scheme formed to the
detriment of another; a drawing or sketch.
The term 'technical' in a broader sense means 'belonging or relating to an art
or arts; appropriate or peculiar to, or characteristic of a particular art,
science, profession, or occupation'. But the narrow meaning is 'also of or
pertaining to the mechanical arts and applied sciences'.
28\. The term "Technical" has been defined in the Advanced Law Lexicon to
mean:
Technical: Peculiar to a particular art, science or craft (as) technical
skill; technical school or education, "Technical Work" is a phrase of
substantially wider import than 'scientific work'. No doubt all scientific
work may be said to be 'technical', but the converse by no means necessarily
applies'.
29\. In the present case 'Fugro' compiles the data and process them for error
correction and deliver it to De Beers in a computer readable media. Using the
raw input data provided by 'Fugro', the recipient assessee i.e. De Beers using
further process in software technology (which are not owned or provided by
'Fugro') generates a report to determine probable targets. Thus the payments
to 'Fugro' cannot be considered to the payments for technical, plan and design
much less, for the development and transfer of them. 'Fugro' is engaged in
providing services relating to collection and processing of data which always
belonged to 'De Beers'. The purpose of agreement is, for provision of services
and not for supply or transfer of technical plan or design. The reports and
maps are only an additional mode of report of data and cannot be construed as
technical plan or technical design. The payments made to 'Fugro' cannot be
considered as 'fees for technical services' as such payments are not in
consideration for the development and transfer of technical plan and technical
design.
30\. Meanings of the words 'development' and 'transfer'--
The term "development" has been defined in the Advanced Law Lexicon to mean:
The act, process or result of developing or growing or causing to grow; the
state of being developed" happening. The word 'transfer' means the passage of
a right from one individual to another. According to the ordinary dictionary
meaning as appearing in Murrays' Oxford Dictionary, Volume II p.257 transfer
means "to convey or make over title, right or property by deed or legal
process
31\. Under Section 2(47) of the Act, the term "transfer", in relation to a
capital asset, includes:
i) "the sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset; or
ii) the extinguishment of any rights therein; or
iii) the compulsory acquisition thereof under any law; or
iv) ...
In the case of Sunil Siddharthbhai v. Commissioner of Income-tax Kartikeya 156
ITR 509(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:
In the general sense, the expression "transfer of property" connotes the
passing of rights in property from one person to another. In one case, there
may be a passing of the entire bundle of rights from the transferor to the
transferee.
Under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the term "transfer" means any act by
which a living person conveys property, I present or in future, to one or more
living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and "to
transfer property" is to perform such act.
32\. It may be noted that Article 12(5)(b) of the India - Netherlands DTAA
reads "make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how or
processes or consist of the development and transfer of a technical plan or
technical design".
(Emphasis own)
33\. The word used in the above definition is "and" and not "or". Where
certain provisions are separated by the use of conjunction 'and', those
provisions are to be read cojointly. Where the intention of the legislature is

Thus on this issue also we agree with the findings of the first appellate
authority. Thus we answer the second question is in the negative, in favour of
the assessee and against the revenue. In the result all the appeals of revenue
are dismissed.

in a variety of ways, depending upon the location and the type of diamond
deposit sought. Exploration over a large area can be carried out by sampling
the streams or loam sampling the surface soils looking for indicator minerals
or by geophysical methods where surface sampling would not be effective
exploration tool or would be too expensive.
4\. Regional diamond exploration entails the search over hundreds of square
kilometers (or miles) seeking an economic diamond deposit. The manner in which
this exploration is carried out depends upon the surface geology and
topography of the area to be explored. Where there is good stream development,
usually in hilly or undulating terrain, the main exploration method has been
by sampling the stream sediments for "kimberlitic Indicator Minerals" (KIM).
These KIM are special minerals that occur in kimberlite and lamprolite and due
to their high specific gravity, tend to be concentrated in "trap sites" along
with other heavy minerals (e.g.gold, tin, sapphires). Stream sampling can
yield a larger array of KIM including pyrope granet, picrolimenite, chrome
diopside and chromite. Diamond is rarely recovered during the regional
exploration sampling of an area.
