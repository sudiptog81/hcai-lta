interpretation of legal provisions and the litigants whom they represent
cannot be said to be bound thereby for all times to come or stop from
contending to the contrary.
43\. Sites, reserved in a layout plan for a school and qua which it has been
held as aforesaid, can also be sold / transferred by the coloniser /
developer, W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 43 of 44 cannot be compared
to public streets, so as to contend that public hearing, as required to be
given before closure of a public street, ought to be given before change of
user thereof. The only ground on which the petitioners could have challenged
such change was of the same being contrary to prescribed parameters and which
has not been done.
44\. No merit is thus found in the petitions; dismissed.
45\. Though the petitioners by pursuing these petitions have cast a cloud on
the right of the MCD to proceed with the development / construction undertaken
by it on the subject land and which cloud, I am sure, must have impacted the
progress of the construction inspite of there being no stay thereagainst, but

CORAM:-
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page
1 of 44
1\. Both petitions concern a plot of land in the layout plan of the
residential colony of Greater Kailash, Part-II (GK-II) on which the respondent
no.1 South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is going ahead with the
development / construction of a Community Centre-cum-Club and residential
accommodation for its employees. The petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 is a
Society of the residents of the colony of GK-II which has constructed and
manages a Gurudwara adjacent to the said plot of land and has filed this
petition objecting to the said development / construction by SDMC inter alia
on the ground that the land aforesaid was ear-marked for the purpose of a
school and cannot be used for the purpose of a Community Centre-cum-Club and
residential accommodation for employees of the SDMC and offering to itself
establish a school on the said plot of land. The petitioner in W.P.(C)
no.5817/2014 is a Society, also consisting of residents of the colony of GK-II
and also objects to the construction / development underway inter alia on the
ground that the same would create a concrete jungle to the prejudice of the
existing residents of the colony.
2\. W.P.(C) no.4651/2014 came up before this Court first on 28th July, 2014
when though notice thereof was issued but the interim relief sought of
restraining the SDMC from going ahead with the work of development / W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 2 of 44 construction on the said land not
granted. However vide order dated 19th November, 2014, the construction being
carried out was made subject to the further orders in the writ petition and it
was clarified that the same would not create any special equities in favour of
the SDMC. Similarly, no interim relief was granted in W.P.(C) No.5817/2014
also.
3\. The aforesaid plot of land has a long history. The colony of GK-II in
which it is situated was developed by a private developer "DLF", after having
the layout plan thereof approved in the year 1959 from the Standing Committee
of the then Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and a completion plan in
pursuance thereto was approved in the year 1971. In the said layout plan, the
said plot was shown for community facilities. However notwithstanding the
colony having been fully developed and inhabited, use of the said land for
community facilities remained stalled owing to a dispute between DLF, which
besides the said colony of GK-II had also developed a large number of other
residential colonies in Delhi, and the MCD with respect to the title of such
sites sanctioned in each of the colonies for community facilities. The said
dispute remained pending in the Court till 1989\. Ultimately, in the year
1989, a settlement was arrived at between DLF and the MCD and in which
settlement, the sites in different colonies W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014
Page 3 of 44 were inter alia divided / allocated between DLF and MCD and the
subject site fell to the allocation of MCD.
4\. However thereafter also the aforesaid plot of land remained un- utilised
and it is the case of the petitioners that a part thereof was developed by the
MCD itself as „Udai Shankar Park‟ and the remaining land was used by the
residents, from time to time, for holding Diwali Utsav, Durga Puja, etc.
5\. The petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 earlier filed W.P.(C) No.4478/1994
pleading i) that at the time when it had established the Gurudwara and when
the residents of the locality had built their houses in the colony of GK-II,
the subject land was shown in the layout plan of the colony for the purposes
of a school; ii) that MCD had however on 28th September, 1994 laid a
foundation stone on the subject land for establishing a public swimming pool;
iii) that without issuing a statutory notice inviting objections for changing
the ear-marked purpose of the „school land‟ to „swimming pool‟ and without the
permission of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) and without altering the
sanctioned layout plan, the land could not be used for a swimming pool; and,
iv) that a school at the said W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 4 of 44
site was required for the residents of the colony and use of the land as
proposed for the swimming pool was contrary to law.
6\. The aforesaid W.P.(C) no.4478/1994 was disposed of on 29th April, 1998
recording the statement of the counsel for the MCD that it will not change the
user of the subject land except in accordance with law and till such change,
no construction activity shall be carried out on the plot.
7\. W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 was filed, pleading:
> (i) that on 17th November, 2003, a note was prepared by the Commissioner,
> MCD suggesting that the subject land originally meant for school be utilised
> for construction of staff quarters for MCD including the Commissioner‟s
> residence;
> (ii) that through a Standing Committee resolution of MCD dated 30th July,
> 2003, a modification of the layout plan of the colony was sought to be done
> by carving out a plot measuring 2000 sq. mtrs. from the subject land for
> construction of a community hall for the use by MCD as a club;
> (iii) that the Standing Committee of the MCD, vide resolution dated 24th
> March, 2006, purportedly in exercise of powers under Section 313 of the
> Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (MCD Act), approved utilisation of the
> land in question for construction of official residence of the Commissioner
> of MCD W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 5 of 44 and staff quarters and
> for utilisation of the proposed community hall as community hall /
> recreational club for MCD staff;
> (iv) however Section 313, falling in Chapter XV of the MCD Act, deals with
> the issue of streets only;
> (v) that the Commissioner, SDMC (in whose jurisdiction the subject land fell
> on trifurcation of MCD) had vide letter dated 18th April, 2013 to the
> Municipal Secretary objected to allocation of Rs.10 crores only against the
> project cost of Rs.92 crores for the aforesaid construction / development on
> the MCD lands;
> (vi) that from the aforesaid letter, it is also borne out that in addition
> to staff quarters and the Commissioner‟s residence, there was a plan to
> construct a 19 floor tower to accommodate 38 numbers Type V quarters and 40
> numbers Type VI quarters plus a 20 floor tower;
> (vii) that the area is already highly congested and such massive development
> / construction thereon would further congest the area;
> (viii) that though residents of the colony protested but foundation stone
> for the proposed community centre was laid on 14th June, 2014 and some fully
> grown trees on the land were felled on 26th June, 2014;
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 6 of 44
> (ix) that the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) of GK-II filed Original
> Application No.132/2014 before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), Principal
> Bench, New Delhi against the felling of trees and the NGT granted a status
> quo order and directed that no further felling of trees be carried out; and,
> (x) that the land is ear-marked for a school which is required and which a
> number of entities were willing to establish.
8\. The pleadings in W.P.(C) No.5817/2014 are similar save that in addition,
it is pleaded:
> (i) that it is a term of the Settlement Deed dated 24th July, 1989 between
> the MCD and the DLF that the sites for school, health centres and community
> centres would be utilised for the purposes shown in the approved lay-out
> plan and that the community centres and public building sites of GK-II could
> be used for construction of community hall or any other user permissible
> under the public and semi-public facilities including social and cultural
> institutions as per the zoning regulations of the master plan;
> (ii) that as per the approved lay out plan of the colony, subject land was
> ear-marked for three pre-primary schools, one basic primary school and one
> religious building;
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 7 of 44
> (iii) that vide Resolution No.312 dated 30th July, 2003, the approved layout
> plan of the colony was modified to provide for construction of a community
> hall on the subject land and which was further modified vide Resolution
> No.75 dated 1 st June, 2004 to provide that the said community hall would be
> made part of the complex to be used as community hall / recreational club
> for the MCD staff;
> (iv) that the Resolution dated 1st June, 2004 is also contrary to the
> Settlement Deed dated 24th July, 1989 between MCD and DLF;
> (v) that there is no provision in the MCD Act that the open space left for
> school or park in a private colony can be used by MCD as an owner for its
> own purpose;
> (vi) that the SDMC is merely the custodian of the said land and cannot claim
> any ownership rights with respect thereto; and,
> (vii) that the SDMC is misusing public money for constructing a lavish
> recreational club for its staff in the garb of making a community hall for
> residents.
9\. It is the stand of the respondent no.1 SDMC in its counter affidavit in
W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 i) that the aforesaid site measuring about 3.5 acres
located at E-Block, Greater Kailash, Part-II was taken over by erstwhile MCD
from DLF along with 75 other sites under amicable settlement approved by the
Standing Committee vide Resolution No.383 dated 3 rd May, W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 8 of 44 1989; ii) that later on, MCD vide
Resolution dated 1 st June, 2004 modified the layout plan of GK-II by
utilising the site at E-Block for the construction of MCD staff quarters
including the Commissioner‟s residence with the condition that the plot
measuring 2000 sq. mtrs. approved by the Standing Committee vide Resolution
No.312 dated 30th July, 2003 for construction of community hall shall be part
of the complex; iii) that the aforesaid modification of the layout plan was
without any change in the Zonal Development Plan or Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)
inasmuch as, as per the Zonal Development Plan of Zone „F‟ under MPD-2001 and
MPD-2021, the land use of the site under reference is Gross Residential Area
and the community facilities sites are permitted in Gross Residential Area;
iv) that moreover this is an activity related to layout level and not Zonal
Plan / Master Plan level; v) that the petition insofar as impugning the
modification of the Layout Plan is not maintainable as an appeal lies to the
Appellate Tribunal, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (ATMCD) thereagainst under
Section 347B of the MCD Act; vi) it has been held by this Court in Shanti Devi
Gupta Vs. Delhi Development Authority AIR 1994 Delhi 229 that for change in
the Layout Plan, no approval or sanction of the Central Government is
required; vii) that it has been held by this Court in W.P.(C) W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 9 of 44 No.9077/2005 titled RWA Guru Nanak Pura
Vs. MCD that once the prescribed land use as per the Zonal Development Plan
and the Master Plan is residential, no error capable of interference can be
found in the resolution of the MCD sanctioning residential plots where earlier
a park existed and that the remedy before the Appellate Tribunal being
available against modifications of Layout Plan, writ petition is not
maintainable; viii) that the education department has given no objection for
developing the school sites for Recreation Centre as there is no demand for
opening a Primary School in GK-II; ix) that no permission from DUAC is
required to be taken with respect to the subject land as in terms of the
decision taken in the meeting held on 25th January, 2006 of DUAC, its
functions shall cover consideration of proposals pertaining to development of
district centres, sub-district centres, community centres, areas ear-marked
for Government, administrative buildings and for residential complexes, public
building / complexes on more than 2 hectares in area or taller than 26 meters
in height or having plot area more than 1000 sq. mtrs. abutting 24 mtrs. or
more wide road; x) that the area of the subject land is not more than 2
hectares and the building as proposed to be constructed is not taller than 26
mtrs. and the road abutting the subject land is not 24 mtrs. or more wide; the
road abutting the W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 10 of 44 subject land
is only 18 mtrs. wide; xi) that the respondent no.1 SDMC has started the work
of building housing complex for its employees on the subject land only after
following due process of law and after obtaining requisite approval from the
concerned authorities; xii) denying that any note as alleged was prepared on
17th November, 2003, xiii) that NGT has rejected all the contentions of the
RWA; and, xiv) that the area of GK-II and its neighbouring area of Chitranjan

schools.
10\. The respondent no.4 Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in its counter
affidavit in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 has merely pleaded that as per Clause 3(11)
of MPD-2021, Layout Plans / Site Plans and Building Plans shall be approved by
the Local Bodies and Authorities in their areas of jurisdiction and has
reproduced Table 4.2 titled "Infrastructure Requirement for layout at
Residential Neighbourhood level of the MPD-2021" and as per which there has to
be one Primary School on land ad-measuring 0.20 to 0.40 hectares and one
Senior Secondary School on land ad-measuring 0.60 to 0.80 hectares and further
stated that the land is situated in the jurisdiction of MCD and thus the DDA
has no role.
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 11 of 44
11\. The respondent no.2 Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCTD) in its counter
affidavit in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 has also taken a stand that the averments in
the petition pertain to local body and do not concern the respondent no.2
GNCTD.
12\. No counter affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.3 DUAC or the
respondent no.5 Union of India (UOI).
13\. No counter affidavit has been filed by the sole respondent SDMC in
W.P.(C) No.5817/2014 though written synopsis of submissions supported by
documents has been filed.
14\. Hearing of the petitions was commenced on 20th July, 2015 when a number
of queries were raised from the counsels. Hearing was concluded on 14th
January, 2016 and judgment reserved.
15\. It was the contention of the senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C)
No.4651/2014:
> (a) that Section 313(1)(b) of the MCD Act requires a Layout Plan to show the
> reservation or allotment of any site for any "street, open space, park,
> recreation ground, school, market or any other public purpose";
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 12 of 44
> (b) that a reservation in the Layout Plan for a school cannot be changed;
> (c) that even the DDA in its minutes of the Second Technical Committee held
> on 10th February, 2014 permitted alternate use of vacant / un-allotted
> nursery school sites in developed Zones A to H and urban extension (Dwarka,
> Rohini & Narela Project) only for park if on road below 9 mtrs. and
> prohibited community recreational club thereon;
> (d) that the Layout Plan insofar as reserving the sites for open spaces,
> park, recreational ground, school, market or any other public purposes
> cannot be revised because the rights in the said land in favour of the
> public are created at the time of such reservation being sanctioned;
> (e) that SDMC is not the owner of the subject land and is merely a
> caretaker;
> (f) that MCD previously having not permitted DLF change of user with respect
> to the subject land, cannot now itself change the user;
> (g) that under the Settlement Deed dated 24th July, 1989 between DLF and MCD
> also, the sites for schools, health centres and community centres which had
> fallen to the share of DLF were to be utilised for the purposes shown in the
> approved Layout Plan of the colonies and could not be used for construction
> of W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 13 of 44 community hall or any
> other use as permissible under the public and semi-public facilities
> including social and cultural institutions as per Zoning Regulations of
> Master Plan;
> (h) had the subject site fell to the share of DLF in the said settlement,
> the purpose thereof could not have been changed and since MCD extracted the
> said site from DLF, under the Settlement, for itself, it also is not
> entitled to change the purpose of the site which has fallen to its share;
> (i) that even DLF who was the owner of the entire land underneath the colony
> of GK-II, upon reservation of the subject site for a school, was left with
> no absolute rights as owner therein;
> (j) that the subject site even otherwise has vested in the MCD only for the
> purpose of maintenance; attention in this regard is invited to Sections 298
> and 299 of the MCD Act particularly to proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section
> 299 of the MCD Act requiring a reasonable opportunity to the residents
> likely to be affected to be given;
> (k) that the Resolution dated 1st June, 2004 became stale upon no action in
> terms thereof being taken till the year 2014 as the same was based on
> assessment then done of there being no need for a school and the need for a
> school changed in 10 years;
> (l) reliance was placed on Arjun Singh Vs. Deputy Mal Jain ILR (1982) I
> Delhi 11, D.L.F. Housing & Construction (P) Ltd. Vs. W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 &
> 5817/2014 Page 14 of 44 Delhi Municipal Corporation ILR (1969) Del 1055 (DB)
> and Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. Vs. Minguel Martins (2009) 3 SCC 571 on
> the concept of „Trust‟ in law; it was clarified that though the Division
> Bench, in appeal, reversed Arjun Singh supra but without examining Section
> 313 of the MCD Act;
> (m) in the context of use of the word "reservation" in Section 313(1)(b) of
> the MCD Act, attention to the definition of "reservation" in Black‟s Law
> Dictionary, Fifth Edition was invited;
> (n) reference was made to Green Park Association (Regd.)Society Vs.
> Corporation of Delhi 2000 V AD (Delhi) 561 where, relying on Pt. Chet Ram
> Vashist Vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (1995) 1 SCC 47 it was held that
> a land for primary school vested in MCD for maintenance could not, inspite
> of change of land use thereof, be used for setting up office of the
> Executive Engineer of the MCD as there was a difference between ownership
> and vesting of land in MCD for management purposes;
> (o) D.L.F. Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust Vs. State of
> Haryana (2003) 5 SCC 622, to which attention of the counsels was drawn in
> the order dated 20th July, 2015 does not dilute Pt. Chet Ram Vashist supra;
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 15 of 44
> (p) Greater Kailash-II Welfare Association Vs. Municipal Corporation of
> Delhi 42 (1990) DLT 87, to which also attention of counsels was invited to
> in the order dated 20 th July, 2015, does not affect the rights asserted by
> the petitioner in these petitions;
> (q) reference was made to Shri Girish Vyas Vs. The State of Maharastra
> (2012) 3 SCC 619 where, the shifting of an area reserved for a amenity like
> primary school in favour of kin of Chief Minister was quashed observing that
> the spaces for public amenities, particularly educational institutions, are
> essential for a decent urban life and that the planning process therefore
> assumes significance in this behalf and it was argued that the said
> observations would be binding on this Court as law under Article 141 of the
> Constitution of India;
> (r) attention was also invited to Articles 21A, 45, 243Q(C) and Schedule II
> of the VIIth Schedule to emphasise that there is a constitutional mandate
> for education and it was argued that a statutory provision has to give way
> to the constitution;
> (s) attention was also invited to Section 42(r) of the MCD Act making
> establishment, maintenance and aid to schools for primary education an
> obligatory function of the MCD;
> (t) attention was invited to the provisions of the MPD-2021 to contend that
> inspite of increase of as much as 40.6% in the W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 &
> 5817/2014 Page 16 of 44 population of elderly and children, MCD / SDMC could
> not have held that there is no need for a school;
> (u) it was argued that the appellate remedy is not available because the
> petition is for enforcement of fundamental rights and the action of the
> MCD/SDMC is without jurisdiction;
> (v) reliance is placed on Ahuja Property Developers (P) Ltd. Vs. M.C.D. 42
> (1990) DLT 474 to contend that just like in the context of Section 345A of
> the MCD Act, the Courts have read an opportunity of hearing implicit in an
> action for sealing, so would the position be in the case of change of Layout
> plan;
> (w) reliance was placed on Union of India Vs. Tantia Construction Pvt. Ltd.
> (2011) 5 SCC 697 and on Shiv Kumar Chadha Vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi
> (1993) 3 SCR 522 to contend that alternative remedy is not an absolute bar
> to the invocation of writ jurisdiction; and,
> (x) that the denial by the SDMC in its counter affidavit of the note dated
> 17th November, 2003 of the Commissioner of MCD is contrary to the documents
> filed by the petitioner.
16\. Per contra, the counsel for the respondent no.1 SDMC has argued:
> (i) that the writ remedy is not available in view of the alternative remedy
> of appeal before the ATMCD;
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 17 of 44
> (ii) that the proposed community hall on the subject land is also for the
> residents of the colony; a copy of the Resolution No.352 dated 24th
> February, 2014 of the MCD was handed over in this regard;
> (iii) that under the Settlement Deed dated 24th July, 1989 between MCD and
> DLF, MCD became the full and complete owner of the subject site and all the
> rights, title and interest of DLF, which was admittedly the owner thereof,
> thereunder stood transferred to the MCD;
> (iv) that the argument of public trust is misconceived;
> (v) that the Layout Plan is within the domain of the MCD;
> (vi) that in the Zonal Development Plan of the locality, the use of the
> subject land is prescribed for Gross Residential Purpose;
> (vii) that the change in the Layout Plan does not involve the Zonal Plan or
> the Master Plan;
> (viii) attention was invited to the provisions of Chapter 17 titled
> „Development Code‟ of MPD-2021 and on the basis thereof also it was argued
> that the Layout Plan is within the domain of the MCD only;
> (ix) reliance was placed on Delhi Land and Finance Universal Ltd.
> Vs. Arjun Singh AIR 1986 Delhi 381 (DB) (this is the judgment in appeal from
> Arjun Singh Vs. Deputy Mal Jain W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 18 of
> 44 supra cited by senior counsel for the petitioner) where the challenge to
> the sale of two plots ear-marked for public building in the colony of Model
> Town also developed by DLF on the ground that the earmarking of the plot for
> public building created a trust and DLF was not entitled to sell the land
> and holding that no such trust was created; it was thus argued that the
> whole contention of the senior counsel for the petitioners relating to
> public trust is misconceived;
> (x) reliance in this regard was placed on Greater Kailash-II Welfare
> Association (supra) where also the argument of public trust was rejected;
> (xi) that the issue in Pt. Chet Ram Vashist (supra) was entirely different
> and the same has no applicability to the present controversy;
> (xii) reliance was placed on Shanti Devi Gupta Vs. D.D.A. AIR 1994 Delhi 299
> (DB) holding that departure from Layout Plan cannot be equated with
> violation of Master Plan or Zonal Development Plan which are statutory;
> (xiii) reliance was placed on The State of Bombay Vs. R.S. Nanji AIR 1956 SC
> 294 holding that requisition of premises by Bombay Government to provide
> living accommodation for the employees of the State Road Transport
> Corporation was for a public purpose; attention in this regard was invited
> to Sections W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 19 of 44 43(n)&(o) and 55
> of the DMC Act which are pari materia to the provisions of the Road
> Transport Corporations Act, 1950;
> (xiv) reference was made to Lal Chand Public Charitable Trust Vs. Delhi Wakf
> Board 189 (2012) DLT 397 where it was observed that MCD / SDMC becomes the

17\. The senior counsel for the petitioner, in rejoinder, argued:

18\. The counsel for the petitioner and the counsel for the respondent SDMC in
W.P.(C) No.5817/2014 have adopted the arguments in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014.
19\. The rule, of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution being not
exercised if alternative efficacious remedy is available, is a flexible one
and does not create any absolute bar. These petitions having been entertained,
having remained pending in this Court for nearly two years, interim order
making the construction on the subject land subject to the outcome of these
petitions having been passed, and the counsels having been heard fully on the
merits of the controversy, no case for dismissal of the petitions on the
ground of availability of alternative remedy before the W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014
& 5817/2014 Page 23 of 44 ATMCD is made out. Even otherwise, I tend to agree
with the contention of the senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C)
No.4651/2014 that considering the nature and grounds of the challenge by the
petitioners to the modification of the layout plan of the colony of GK-II, the
challenge before the ATMCD would not serve the purpose. ATMCD is not a Court
but a Tribunal of limited jurisdiction and can entertain a challenge to the
modification of the layout plan only on the grounds of the same being contrary
to the provisions of the Act and not on other grounds also as are urged by the
petitioners. I therefore do not find any merit in the objection of SDMC as to
the maintainability of the writ petitions.
20\. Sections 312 and 313 of the MCD Act are as under:
> "312. Owners' obligation when dealing with land as building sites--If the
> owner of any land utilises, sells, leases out or otherwise disposes of such
> land for the construction of buildings thereon he shall lay down and make a
> street or streets giving access to the plots into which the land may be
> divided and connecting with an existing public or private street.
> 313\. Lay-out plans--(1) Before utilising, selling or otherwise dealing with

W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 24 of 44
> (a) the plots into which the land is proposed to be divided for the erection
> of buildings thereon and the purpose or purposes for which such buildings
> are to be used;
> (b) the reservation or allotment of any site for any street, open space,
> park, recreation ground, school, market or any other public purpose;
> (c) the intended level, direction and width of street or streets;
> (d) the regular line of street or streets;
> (e) the arrangements to be made for levelling, paving, metalling, flagging,
> channelling, sewering, draining, conserving and lighting street or streets;
> (2) The provisions of this Act and the bye-laws made thereunder as to width
> of the public streets and the height of buildings abutting thereon, shall
> apply in the case of streets referred to in sub-section (1) and all the

> (3) Within sixty days after the receipt of any application under sub-section

> development of Delhi whether contained in the master plan or a zonal
> development plan prepared for Delhi or not; or
> (b) if the said lay-out plan does not conform to the provisions of this Act
> and bye-laws made thereunder; or W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 25

> (c) if any street proposed in the plan is not designed so as to connect at
> one end with a street which is already open.
> (5) No person shall utilise, sell or otherwise deal with any land or lay-out

> information which it considers necessary to enable it to deal with the said
> application.
> (6) The lay-out plan referred to earlier in this section shall, if so
> required by the Standing Committee, be prepared by a licensed town planner."
21\. The undisputed facts are that at the time of sanction of the layout plan
of the colony of GK-II, the subject land was reserved, within the meaning of
Section 313(1)(b), for construction of a school and MCD / SDMC has modified
the layout plan to change the prescribed user of the said land from that as a
school to that as for residential accommodation for its employees, community
hall etc. and SDMC is now putting the land to use for its own purpose i.e. of
housing its employees as compared to use as a school for benefit of public.
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 26 of 44
22\. The questions, which according to me, arise for adjudication are:
> (I) Whether layout plan once sanctioned, can be so modified;
> (II) If the answer to the above question is in the affirmative, whether such
> modification also extends to change of user prescribed of land reserved for
> the purposes mentioned in Section 313(1)(b) supra and if so, whether such
> modification is limited from one of the purposes prescribed therein to
> another or the modification can also be by changing the user for any other
> purpose;
> (III) Whether the user of the subject land, as modified, is within the
> purpose mentioned in Section 313(1)(b) of the Act;
> (IV) Whether SDMC is merely a custodian of the said land or is the owner
> thereof.
23\. Since the counsels have contended the aforesaid questions to be no longer
res integra, I straightway proceed to examine the judgments cited in this
respect.
24\. The Division Bench of this Court in Arjun Singh supra was concerned with
a challenge to the sale, by DLF Land and Finance Universal Limited, which had
developed the colony of Model Town in Delhi, of two plots ear-marked for
public building in the layout plan sanctioned by the MCD of the said colony,
to M/s Lal Chand Public Charitable Trust which in W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 &
5817/2014 Page 27 of 44 turn had granted lease thereof in favour of Jain Sabha
Dharamarth Trust and Aggarwal Dharmarth Trust. The learned Single Judge of
this Court (in Arjun Singh Vs. Deputy Mal Jain supra) relying on Section
313(1)(b) of the Act supra held that the setting aside of the land of the said
two plots for public purpose created a trust. On appeal, the Division Bench
held that for there to be a trust, there has to be confidence reposed in some
other and a mere declaration by the owner that he will hold land for public
purpose does not mean that a trust is created. The reasoning given by the
learned Single Judge, of a "constructive trust" and of a "resulting trust" was
also not agreed with. It was further held that just as a developer or a
coloniser cannot be compelled to also construct houses on the plots ear-marked
in the layout plan for residences and or to construct and maintain streets
marked in the layout plan and the land underneath streets has to vest in the
MCD and the land marked for park etc. would also have to be in the hands of
some other public body and just like the land ear-marked for markets could be
developed into market either by the developer or coloniser or by anyone to
whom he may sell that land, so is the reservation of plots for making a public
building; the developer or coloniser is not required to develop the public
building himself. Accordingly, sale of the plots to M/s Lal Chand W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 28 of 44 Public Charitable Trust and the
leasing by M/s Lal Chand Public Charitable Trust of the plots to other public
charitable trusts was upheld with the rider that such plots could be utilized
only by a charitable body for a charitable building and it was further held
that a building which is used for a public purpose will still retain the
character of utilisation of the plot for public purpose. The senior counsel
for the petitioner is thus not correct in saying that the Division Bench in
Arjun Singh supra did not examine Section 313(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.
25\. The Division Bench of this Court in Greater Kailash-II Welfare
Association supra was concerned with a challenge to the resolution dated 3rd
May, 1989 of the Standing Committee of the MCD followed by the Settlement Deed
dated 24th July, 1989 supra between DLF and MCD on the ground that by the said
Settlement Deed the rights of the residents of the colony of GK-II were
adversely affected and that undue favour had been shown to DLF and that the
layout plan once sanctioned of the colony could not be altered. The Division
Bench found that MCD, while sanctioning layout plan of the colonies developed
by DLF had ear-marked open spaces therein for parks, roads and other services
or for public utility building and as many as ten litigations were pending
between DLF and MCD with respect W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 29 of
44 to the said open sites which according to MCD were to be transferred by DLF
to MCD and according to DLF were not so required to be transferred to MCD. The
Division Bench noticed the earlier judgment of the Division Bench of this
Court in Arjun Singh supra holding that the ear-marking of the plots would not
preclude DLF from transferring the plots and held (i) that the Settlement Deed
aforesaid was to bring to an end litigation of the last 25 years and during
which litigation all such sites in all the colonies had remained un-utilised;
(ii) that DLF was the owner of the land on which the colonies had been
developed; (iii) that the settlement was for the benefit of public, to enable
the said sites to be utilised and there was no question of any fraud; iv) that
the power of the MCD under Section 313 to sanction a plan, by virtue of the
General Clauses Act, 1897 includes the power to amend the layout plan; (v) as
long as the amended layout plan is in accordance with the Bye-laws and other
rules and regulations, there can be no objection thereto; and, (vi) that the
Settlement Deed was not in violation of any law.
26\. The question with which the Supreme Court was concerned in Pt. Chet Ram
Vashist supra was, whether in the absence of any provision in the MCD Act
empowering MCD to sanction the plan for building activities with the condition
that open spaces for parks and schools be transferred to the W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 30 of 44 MCD free of cost, MCD was entitled to
demand the same. The facts in which the said question arose were i) that in
the layout plan sanctioned for the colony, the water supply to the colony was
to be by tube wells, till the municipal supply of water reached the colony;
ii) two plots in the colony were set apart for installation of the tube wells;
iii) in the layout plan, restrictions were placed on building activities; iv)
on municipal water supply being made available to the colony, the developer /
coloniser applied for modification of layout plan to remove restrictions
placed on building activity; v) the Standing Committee of the MCD passed a
resolution allowing building activity subject to the condition that the open
spaces for parks and schools be transferred to MCD free of cost; the two plots
reserved for tube wells were also asked to be used as open park; and, vi) the
grievance of the developer / coloniser was with respect to the condition of
transfer of open spaces for parks and schools to the MCD free of costs.
Supreme Court after examining Section 313 supra held (a) that the same does
not entitle MCD to claim any right of interest in the property of the owner;
(b) that the power of MCD under Section 313(3) to impose conditions has to be
understood so as to advance the objective of the provision and the purpose to
serve which it has been enacted; (c) MCD has W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014
Page 31 of 44 been given a right to examine that the layout plan is not
contrary to any provision of the Act or Rules framed thereunder; (d) for
instance, MCD thereunder, can impose conditions like leaving an open space or
require that the length and width of the rooms shall not be less than a
particular measurement or that a coloniser shall have to provide amenities and
facilities to those who shall purchase land or building in the colony but does
not entitle the MCD to impose a condition for transfer of the land in favour
of MCD free of cost; (e) the power to impose conditions cannot be construed to
mean that MCD, before sanctioning a layout plan cannot claim that it will
sanction only if owner surrenders a portion of the land in MCD‟s favour free
of cost; (f) that would be violation of civil rights which vest in every
person to own and hold land; (g) the Resolution of MCD directing owner to
transfer land reserved for tube wells, parks, school in favour of MCD free of
cost was depriving the owner of his property and vesting the same in favour of
MCD, against the law; (h) MCD, as custodian of civil amenities and services
can only claim a right to regulate, manage and supervise and look after such
amenities; (i) that reserving any site for any street, open space, park,
school etc. in a layout plan is normally a public purpose as it is inherent in
such reservation that it shall be used by the public in general; (j) the
effect of such W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 32 of 44 reservation is
that the owner ceases to be a legal owner of the land in dispute and he holds
the land for the benefit of the society or of the public in general--it may
result in creating an obligation in the nature of a trust and may preclude the
owner from transferring or selling his interest in it and the interest which
is left in the owner is a residuary interest which may be nothing more than a
right to hold that land in trust for the specific purpose specified in the
sanctioned plan but the same still does not entitle the MCD to claim that the
land so specified should be transferred to it free of cost; (k) MCD, by virtue
of the land being specified as open space in the layout plan, may get a right
as a custodian of public interest to manage it in the interest of the society
in general but the right to manage as local body is not the same thing as to
claim transfer of the property to itself. However, finding that the developer
/ coloniser had not immediately rasied objection in this regard and that MCD
had been exercising rights over the land for long and finding it not
appropriate to disturb the settled state of affairs, it was directed that MCD
shall continue to exercise such rights over the land which was ear- marked for
school, park etc. but would not change the user thereof and the said land
shall be in the beneficial enjoyment of the residents of the colony concerned.
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 33 of 44
27\. It would thus be noticed, that the question with which these petitions
are concerned, viz. whether a reservation under Section 313(1)(b) once done
for a particular purpose can be changed for another purpose specified therein
or removed i.e. by prescribing the use of that land for a private purpose, as
compared to public purpose, did not fall for consideration in either of the
above cases. What the aforesaid judgments answer is, only question no.I of the
questions framed by me in para 22 above i.e. that the layout plan once
sanctioned, can be modified. It was held so expressly by the Division Bench in
Greater Kailash-II Welfare Association supra and Pt. Chet Ram Vashisht supra
also was a case of modification of layout plan and the Supreme Court, though
not faced with the issue, did not hold that layout plan once sanctioned could
not be modified.
28\. Once, there is no bar to the modification / alteration of a layout plan,
I see no reason to limit the said power to Clauses (a),(c),(d) & (e) of
Section 313(1) and to hold that the power of such modification / alteration
does not extend to the reservation under Section 313(1)(b) of the Act. There
is nothing in Section 313 or in any other provision to suggest so. The
reservation under Section 313(1)(b) of the MCD Act is not as per the ipsi
dixit of the developer / coloniser or of the Standing Committee of MCD.
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 34 of 44 The developer / coloniser is
ordinarily interested in having the maximum permissible area available for
sale / development into residential and commercial and would be interested in
reserving only the minimum prescribed area for streets, open spaces, parks,
recreation grounds, schools, markets or for any other public purpose and would
not voluntarily reserve an area in excess thereof, and for which he reaps no
price, for such public purposes. MCD also, cannot insist upon the developer /
coloniser reserving more than the prescribed area. Supreme Court, in Pt. Chet
Ram Vashisht supra also held that reservation of sites for streets, open
spaces, parks, schools etc. has to be in accordance with the prevalent bye-
laws or other parameters prescribed. If with the passage of time or for any
other reason (as in Pt. Chet Ram Vashist supra, where the need for tube well
for which the plot was ear-marked disappeared with the passage of time) the
parameters of the area required to be reserved for streets, open spaces,
parks, recreation grounds, schools, markets or for any other public purpose
changes or the need therefor disappears, I see no reason to hold that
notwithstanding the same, MCD or developer / coloniser are precluded from
seeking such modification. In fact, a situation may also arise where the
residents W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 35 of 44 themselves may want
the user to be changed as per the changed needs and requirements of
public/society.
29\. The argument of the petitioners however is that once such a reservation
is made for a public purpose, rights in favour of public are created in such
land / sites and which cannot be taken away by modification of layout plan. I
do not agree. As aforesaid, though a Single Judge of this Court in Arjun Singh
Vs. Deputy Mal Jain supra held so but the Division Bench in appeal, in Delhi
Land and Finance Universal Ltd. Vs. Arjun Singh supra held that there is no
such trust created. I do not agree with the contention of senior counsel for
the petitioner that Pt. Ceht Ram Vashisht supra holds otherwise. Though this
Court, in that case had held (see placitum „h‟ at page 50) that a fiduciary
relationship in the nature of a trust arises and the coloniser ceases to have
the beneficial interest in the lands so reserved for public purpose and that
the beneficial enjoyment of said land after sanction of layout plan vests in
third parties but the Supreme Court held the said reasoning of this Court to
be not correct (see placitum „h‟ page 54) and held such restriction to be only
placing a bar on exercise of power by the coloniser as owner on dealing with
the reserved land except in accordance with the resolution i.e. for the
benefit of public in general and to this extent W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 &
5817/2014 Page 36 of 44 creates an obligation in the nature of a trust and may
preclude the coloniser as owner from transferring or selling his interest in
it but not interfering with the ownership rights of the coloniser therein.
30\. I may at this stage mention that Supreme Court in D.L.F. Qutab Enclave
Complex Educational Charitable Trust supra has held that reservation of sites
for construction of schools, community buildings etc. while granting licence
to a developer / coloniser for setting up of a colony does not bar the
developer / coloniser from transferring the said sites and further held that
the transfer would be subject to the same statutory obligations which were
placed on the developer / coloniser. It thus appears that the reasoning given
by the Division Bench of this Court in Arjun Singh supra was approved of by
the Supreme Court. In Pt. Chet Ram Vashisht, Supreme Court was not directly
concerned with the said issue and had only observed that the coloniser „may‟
not be entitled to sell his interest in reserved land.
31\. It would thus be seen that the act of „reservation for public purpose‟
under Section 313(1)(b) does not divest the coloniser as owner of his
ownership rights and does not vest such ownership rights in the public so as
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 37 of 44 to say that the coloniser
having lost ownership cannot take the benefit of having the land which was so
„reserved‟, „deserved‟, if has become otherwise permissible in law or that the
public only, after the initial reservation, can deal with the said land. The
„reservation‟ is only imposing restrictions on ownership rights of coloniser
and if the said restrictions are no longer required to be continued, the
coloniser as owner can apply for removal thereof. Pt. Chet Ram Vashisht supra
is not a precedent for the proposition that „reservation‟ under Section
313(1)(b) is irreversible.
32\. I therefore conclude and answer question no.II framed in para 22 above by
concluding that the power of alternation / modification of layout plan extends
to, in accordance with prevalent bye-laws / needs / requirements, change of
user of land earlier reserved for one of the purposes under Section 313(1)(b),
not only to any other purpose specified therein but also for other purposes
not falling therein. Such interpretation of Section 313(1)(b), according to me
is also in public interest as I feel that any land, of which no more is being
produced, should not be shackled so as to prevent use thereof as per the needs
from time to time of the fast changing society. W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 &
5817/2014 Page 38 of 44
33\. That takes me to the merits of the modification to the layout plan
effected by the MCD. The senior counsel for the petitioner has not drawn
attention to any provision of the contemporaneous parameters prescribed,
prescribing a school / additional school for a colony of the size of GK-II. It
is only generally argued that the need for schools cannot disappear. As
against that, is the stand of MCD as a public body and which as per judgments
aforesaid also, is the custodian of such public rights, that there is no need
for such a school. In fact, the petitioners have not even shown any provision
of the time when the said layout plan was sanctioned, requiring the
reservation of a plot, as the size of the subject plot, for a school and have
not argued that the said provision has not changed. It cannot be lost sight of
that the layout plan making such reservation was sanctioned more than half a
century ago in the year 1959 and since then Delhi, which was a city, has
expanded to National Capital Region, MCD has been trifurcated and not only
have there been physical / infrastructural changes but also societal changes
in the needs, requirements and aspirations of the people. The petitioners
cannot obstruct a change without pleading and proving that the same is
contrary to prevalent parameters for a colony of the size and locale of GK-II
and which I am afraid the petitioners have failed to do. Petitioners W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 39 of 44 pegged their case only on the doctrine
of „trust‟ and in which I have found no merit.
34\. Though the modification of layout plan was also alleged to be contrary to
the provisions of DDA and DUAC Acts but the said contention also could not be
substantiated.
35\. Though in the light of the aforesaid view taken, need to adjudicate the
question III, framed in para 22 above i.e. whether providing for residence for
MCD employees is a public purpose or not within the meaning of Section
313(1)(b) of the Act, does not arise but for the sake of completeness, I may
state that in my view it does not qualify so. As has been clarified in Pt.
Chet Ram Vashist supra qua the words "on such conditions" in Section 313(3),
so also, in my view, the words „public purpose‟ in Section 313(1)(b) can only
mean purpose for the benefit of the future residents of the colony and which
though may include land for an electric sub-station or for a pump room or tube
well as in Pt. Chet Ram Vashist supra but can certainly not include residence
for the employees of MCD, particularly when the said employees are not stated
to be required to be residing in the colony for the purpose of rendering
municipal services to the residents of the colony only. W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014
& 5817/2014 Page 40 of 44
36\. That takes me to the nature of the title of MCD to the said land.
37\. It follows from Pt. Chet Ram Vashist supra that the developer / coloniser
remains the owner of the land reserved under Section 313(1)(b) but which
ownership is made subject to the said restrictions/reservation. Following the
said logic, upon transfer of the land under the Settlement Deed dated 24th
July, 1989 to MCD, MCD became the owner of the said land, subject to the
restrictions aforesaid. However, once the said restrictions are removed, MCD
became free to use the land as owner thereof for whatsoever purpose it deems
fit. No merit is found in the contention of the senior counsel for the
petitioner, of there being anything to the contrary in the Settlement Deed
dated 24th July, 1989. Rather, a reading of the said Settlement Deed shows the
rights as held by DLF in the subject land having been transferred to MCD.
Since, DLF was the owner subject to restrictions, the same has to be the
status of the MCD.
38\. I am even otherwise of the view that at least the petitioner in W.P.(C)
No.5817/2014, who was also the petitioner in Greater Kailash-II Welfare
Association supra, is estopped from raising the said issue. The said
petitioner had challenged the settlement deed, under which SDMC claims W.P.(C)
Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 41 of 44 rights in the land, and failed
therein. One of the arguments of the petitioner therein was of the settlement
deed being violative of Chapter 20C of the Income Tax Act, meaning the
petitioner was also admitting the settlement to be by way of change of
ownership. The petitioner then did not make any claim of vesting of the land
irreversibly in public. The petitioner now is barred from contending so, on
the principles of constructive res judicata and issue estoppel. The petitioner
in W.P.(C) No.4651/2014 also represents interest of the same persons as
petitioner in W.P.(C) No.5817/2014 and is equally bound.
39\. That brings me to Green Park Association (Regd.) Society supra. In that
case, a decree was passed restraining MCD from using a plot of land ear-marked
in the layout plan of the colony for the purpose of a school for any other
purpose. In opposition to the execution of the said decree, it was pleaded
that subsequent to the decree, the layout plan had been modified to change the
purpose of the land from that of a school to that of for the purpose of an
office of the Executive Engineer of the MCD. It was held that modification of
the layout plan was in violation of the decree. It was further held that MCD
being not the owner of the land could not have used the land for its own
purpose.
W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 42 of 44
40\. The position here is entirely different. While in Green Park Association
(Regd.) Society supra the land vested in the MCD only for management, here
vide the Settlement Deed dated 24th July, 1989, the land stands transferred to
the MCD/SDMC. Thus, the ratio of Green Park Association (Regd.) Society supra
cannot apply to the facts of the present case.
41\. Similarly, the other judgments cited by the senior counsel for the
petitioner are not found to be applicable to the present case.
42\. I do not also find any merit in the argument of the senior counsel for
the petitioner that MCD is bound by the arguments made by it in an earlier
case. I am not aware of any principle of law or of estoppel to the said
effect. Arguments in a Court of Law, particularly as to interpretation of
statutory provisions, are made by counsels on their own understanding and
interpretation of legal provisions and the litigants whom they represent
cannot be said to be bound thereby for all times to come or stop from
contending to the contrary.
43\. Sites, reserved in a layout plan for a school and qua which it has been
held as aforesaid, can also be sold / transferred by the coloniser /
developer, W.P.(C) Nos.4651/2014 & 5817/2014 Page 43 of 44 cannot be compared
to public streets, so as to contend that public hearing, as required to be
given before closure of a public street, ought to be given before change of
user thereof. The only ground on which the petitioners could have challenged
such change was of the same being contrary to prescribed parameters and which
has not been done.
44\. No merit is thus found in the petitions; dismissed.
45\. Though the petitioners by pursuing these petitions have cast a cloud on
the right of the MCD to proceed with the development / construction undertaken
by it on the subject land and which cloud, I am sure, must have impacted the
progress of the construction inspite of there being no stay thereagainst, but
I refrain from imposing costs.
