for the stamp duty exemption. But NICEL sgbnnitted to PWD that exemption from
payment of stamp duty is required for 14,33? acres instead of 24$ 5,850 acres
and the Deputy Secretary, Revenue Department prepared a note stating that
th4e.VV_iC:ab_inet note stand modified. This is totally non----application of

Accordingéllto» learned counsel for the petitioners, the the various
authorities while giving Objection Certificates to various per'son--sa to sell

was discrimination on' the part of the authorities in treating the similarly
