On the facts, and in the circumstances of the case and with the consent of
learned counsel for the respective parties, the petitions are being heard and
decided  Page 2 of 53 HC-NIC Page 2 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST
2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT finally.
2\. These petitions have been preferred under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India, praying for the issuance of an appropriate Writ or
direction, partially quashing and setting aside the impugned orders dated
06.10.2016, passed by respondent No.1 Special Secretary (Appeals), Revenue
Department ("SSRD" for short), only to the extent that they direct the Deputy
Collector (East), Ahmedabad, respondent No.3 herein, to hear the revision
applications and decide the same on merits, after following the principles of
natural justice.
3\. The petitioners have further prayed for the issuance of a Writ of
Prohibition restraining the Deputy Collector from adjudicating upon RTS
Appeals pending before him, as mentioned in each of the petitions.
4\. As identical issues of fact and law are involved in the petitions, the
parties are common and the same orders have been challenged and prayers  Page

C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT made, the petitions have been clubbed together.
Common arguments have been advanced by learned counsel for the respective
parties and the petitions are being finally decided by this judgment.
5\. For the sake of convenience, reference will be made to the facts as
described in Special Civil Application No.20096/2016. The rather complicated
facts are being narrated in order to give the background, though they may not
be immediately relevant to the legal issues arising in the petitions.
6\. It is the case of the petitioner that he and respondents Nos.7 to 12 are
the legal heirs of Galabji Ataji Thakore. Respondent No.6 is Udaji Ataji
Thakore. Galabji Thakore and Udaji Thakore are the legal heirs of Rukhiben,
who was the daughter of Chakuji Thakore and was married to Ataji Thakore.
Chakuji Thakore had two legal heirs, namely, Gabhaji Chakuji and Rukhiben
Chakuji. On the demise of Gabhaji Chakuji, Shakriben, his widow, was the sole
survivor of  Page 4 of 53 HC-NIC Page 4 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT the pedigree of Gabhaji Chakuji as
they had no children. A copy of the pedigree has been annexed as Annexure­C to
the petition.
7\. Upon the demise of Chakuji Rajaji, the name of Gabhaji Chakuji and
Rukhiben Chakuji came to be mutated in the revenue record in respect of Block
No.66 vide Mutation Entry No.1534 dated 26.03.1993. Thereafter, upon the
demise of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore, respondent No.5 (the sole contesting
respondent), showing himself to be the legal heir of Gabhaji, got his name
mutated along with the name of Shakriben, vide Mutation Entry No.1643 dated
30.08.1993 though, according to the petitioner, the said respondent is not the
legal heir of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore. Upon her demise, the name of Rukhiben
came to be deleted vide Mutation Entry No.1644 dated 01.09.1993.
8\. It is the case of the petitioner that out of the wedlock of Rukhiben with
Ataji, Rukhiben had two sons, namely Galabji Ataji and Udaji Ataji. The
petitioner asserts that when the alleged fraud  Page 5 of 53 HC-NIC Page 5 of
53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT of
mutating his name as Amratji Gabhaji by respondent No.5 came to the notice of
the petitioners, they challenged both the Mutation Entries No.1643 and 1644,
by filing RTS Appeal No.1356/2011 before the Deputy Collector who, after
scrutinising the material on record, allowed the appeal and cancelled Mutation
Entries Nos.1643 and 1644, further directing the Mamlatdar, Daskroi, to mutate
the names of the legal heirs of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore and Rukhiben Chakuji
Thakore, after verification of documents.
9\. Aggrieved by this order, respondent No.5 filed RTS Revision No.249/2012
before the Collector, respondent No.2 herein. By an order dated 12.11.2013,
the Collector dismissed the said revision application and confirmed the order
dated 30.03.2012 passed by the Deputy Collector. Further aggrieved by the
above­mentioned order of the Deputy Collector, as confirmed by the Collector,
respondent No.5 filed Revision Application No.66/2014 before the SSRD, along
with an application for the grant of interim  Page 6 of 53 HC-NIC Page 6 of 53
Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT stay.
The SSRD rejected the application for stay vide an order dated 27.01.2015.
10\. It is the specific case of the petitioner that as no stay order was
issued by the SSRD in favour of respondent No.5, and the orders of the Deputy
Collector as confirmed by that of the Collector that were under challenge by
respondent No.5 in the revision application were operative, the Mamlatdar
initiated action in compliance with the order dated 30.03.2012 passed by the
Deputy Collector and posted Mutation Entry No.2439 regarding the deletion of
the names of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore and Shakriben Gabhaji Thakore, as they
had passed away. The Mamlatdar also posted Mutation Entry No.2440, mutating
the names of the petitioners and respondents Nos.6 to 12 as legal heirs of
Rukhiben Ataji, daughter of Chakuji Thakore. For some reason, stated to be
that the petitioner wanted a more detailed scrutiny of the said mutation
entries in view of the alleged fraud committed by respondent No.5, objections
were raised by him against these entries. However,  Page 7 of 53 HC-NIC Page 7
of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
the said objections were later withdrawn. Mutation Entries Nos.2439 and 2440
were certified on 01.09.2012.
11\. It is further the case of the petitioner that after a delay of four years
from the date of the certification of Mutation Entries No.2439 and 2440,
respondent No.5 thought it fit to challenge the order of the Mamlatdar
certifying the said entries, before the Deputy Collector. It is specifically
averred in the petition that respondent No.5, who had always represented
himself as Amratji Chanduji Thakore (as stated in the pedigree), for the first
time represented himself as Amratji Chanduji alias Amratji Gabhaji Thakore,
even though he is not a legal heir of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore.
12\. This, according to the petitioner, was done by respondent No.5 with the
sole aim of re­opening issues that had attained finality, in retraction of his
own declaration on oath that he has nothing to do with the property in
question and is not a legal heir of Gabhaji Chakuji Thakore,  Page 8 of 53 HC-
NIC Page 8 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT after being unsuccessful in the litigation before the revenue
authorities. The petitioner further asserts that during the pendency of the
revision application filed by respondent No.5 before the SSRD, the said
respondent filed an application for the withdrawal of the revision
application, though a copy thereof was not supplied to the petitioner. While
permitting the unconditional withdrawal of the revision application, regarding
which part of the order the petitioner has no grievance, the SSRD went further
by directing the Deputy Collector to hear the appeals filed by respondent No.5
on merits, by granting him an opportunity of hearing. It is this latter part
of the order of the SSRD that the petitioner is aggrieved by. According to the
petitioner, the appeals filed by respondent No.5 before the SSRD against
mutation entries posted in the revenue record, pursuant to the orders of the
Deputy Collector and Collector that were challenged in the revision
application before the SSRD, came to be withdrawn unconditionally, putting a
Page 9 of 53 HC-NIC Page 9 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT confirmatory stamp of finality upon the said
orders. By directing the Deputy Collector to hear those appeals on merits
after passing the order of unconditional withdrawal would, according to the
petitioner, amount to a re­ opening of issues that have attained finality,
apart from depriving the petitioner from his legal right to raise preliminary
objections. Another grievance raised by the petitioner is that after
permitting the unconditional withdrawal of the revision application, the SSRD
could not have issued directions for hearing the matter on merits after
granting an opportunity of hearing, which direction seriously prejudices the
petitioner and amounts to rehearing matter that have attained finality. It is
in the above context that the petition has been filed, seeking the prayers
mentioned above.
13\. On the other hand, the case of respondent No.5 is that Rukhiben, the
predecessor­in­title of the petitioner, was not a biological daughter of
Chakuji Rajaji but was his step­daughter, who could not have inherited his
property. It is  Page 10 of 53 HC-NIC Page 10 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22
00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT further the case of
respondent No.5 that though he is not the biological son of Gabhaji Chakuji
and Shakriben Gabhaji, he had been adopted by them and, therefore, on the
death of Gabhaji, his name was rightly mutated in the revenue record along
with that of Shakriben and the name of Rukhiben was rightly deleted. It is
contended on behalf of respondent No.5 that the entries to this effect were
challenged belatedly by the petitioner after a lapse of eighteen years.
Respondent No.5 has also stated in his reply that three civil suits are
pending, out of which one suit has been filed by the petitioner for partition,
which fact has not been disclosed in the petition. The case of respondent No.5
further is that the entries made pursuant to the orders of the Deputy
Collector and Collector were posted without hearing him, therefore, he has a
right to challenge them and no finality is attached to the said orders.
14\. The above facts have been briefly narrated as they have been brought on
record by the pleadings and submissions of parties. However,  Page 11 of 53
HC-NIC Page 11 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016
CAV JUDGMENT at the same time, it is necessary to clarify that the scope and
ambit of the petition is confined to the extent of the challenge made to the
latter part of the impugned order of the SSRD and the prayer seeking the
issuance of a Writ of Prohibition, restraining the Deputy Collector from
proceeding with the appeals pending before him. The order under partial
challenge, being essentially an order permitting the unconditional withdrawal
of the revision application and issuing the impugned directions, is not an
order on the merits of the matter. It is a matter of record that the Civil
Court is in the process of adjudicating civil suits between the parties that
would finally determine their lineage, right, title and interest. This Court,
therefore, would not go into those issues but would confine its adjudication
within the issues arising out of the prayers made in the petition and would
refer to those facts that are necessary for the purpose.
15\. Learned counsel for the respective parties have been heard at length and
have advanced detailed  Page 12 of 53 HC-NIC Page 12 of 53 Created On Wed Mar
22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT submissions, which can be
summarised as follows
16\. Mr.R.S.Sanjanwala, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioner, has
submitted that: (1) Respondent No.5 has been unsuccessful in the litigation
before the Deputy Collector and Collector, which went in favour of the
petitioner. The orders of these authorities attained finality upon the
unconditional withdrawal of the revision application as per the order of the
SSRD. Respondent No.5 did not supply a copy of the application for the
withdrawal of the revision application, in which several grounds were
mentioned, to the petitioner. Being unaware of the same, the petitioner was
not heard and could not raise objections to the impugned directions issued by
the SSRD after permitting unconditional withdrawal. The said directions have
been issued behind the back of the petitioner. While permitting the
unconditional withdrawal of the revision application of respondent No.5, the
SSRD has recorded certain findings and issued  Page 13 of 53 HC-NIC Page 13 of
53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
directions in the absence of the petitioner, which could not have been done.
The said directions issued by the SSRD have, very conveniently, opened another
avenue for respondent No.5 to re­agitate concluded issues after the
unconditional withdrawal, in respect of orders that have attained finality.
This part of the order of the SSRD is illegal and deserves to be quashed and
set aside and the proceedings before the Deputy Collector may, therefore, be
prohibited.
(2) The orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector, wherein findings have
been recorded on the basis of the declaration made by respondent No.5 on oath,
stand confirmed by the order of unconditional withdrawal of the revision
application. The mutation entries challenged by respondent No.5 are
consequential to the orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector. Once the
challenge to the said orders has been withdrawn, there can be no challenge to
any consequential action such as posting of entries, taken under those orders
which stand  Page 14 of 53 HC-NIC Page 14 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT confirmed. Respondent No.5 is estopped
from re­ agitating the same issues that have now been concluded as a result of
the unconditional withdrawal of the revision application. He can raise his
claim in the civil suit filed by him but not in revenue proceedings.
(3) The SSRD has directed the Deputy Collector to hear the appeals on merits,
though there is a delay of four years. The seemingly innocuous directions have
far­reaching consequences and amount to a re­hearing of a concluded matter.
The petitioner cannot take the contention of delay, the locus standi of
respondent No.5 or the maintainability of the appeals before the Deputy
Collector, as such legal rights of the petitioner have been curtailed by the
impugned directions of the SSRD. After the unconditional withdrawal of the
revision application, there can be no hearing of the appeals on merits, as
directed by the SSRD.
(4) This Court may issue a Writ of Prohibition restraining the Deputy
Collector  Page 15 of 53 HC-NIC Page 15 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT from dealing with the appeals filed by
respondent No.5 against the mutation entries posted pursuant to the very
orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector that have attained finality after
the unconditional withdrawal of the revision application. Respondent No.5 has
adopted this method to rake up issues on merits after the matter is concluded,
which cannot be permitted. He has lost his right to agitate the issues raised
in the revision application. To get the SSRD to pass the impugned directions
is nothing but an ingenious method devised by respondent No.5 to re­agitate
the matter, in a manner not permitted by law. The Deputy Collector cannot be
permitted to go into those issues again and neither can respondent No.5 pursue
the said appeals which are without jurisdiction.
(5) Respondent No.5 has filed a civil suit for declaration that he is the
owner of the property concerned and the declaration made on oath by him has
been obtained fraudulently. He has also claimed possession and sought a  Page
16 of 53 HC-NIC Page 16 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT permanent injunction. The application at Ex.5
for the grant of an interim injunction has been rejected. In the Appeal from
Order pending before the District Court, no relief has been granted to
respondent No.5 so far. The rights and title of parties will be decided by the
Civil Court, therefore, till such time as the competent Court does not finally
determine such issues, the Deputy Collector may be restrained from dealing
with the appeals pending before him.
17\. In support of the above submissions, reliance has been placed upon a
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of M/s.East India Commercial Co.
Ltd. Calcutta and another v. Collector of Customs, Calcutta \- AIR 1962 SC
1893(1), wherein it is held as below:­ "26. The first question is whether the
petition filed by the appellants under Art. 226 of the Constitution for the
issue of a writ in the nature of prohibition is maintainable in the
circumstances of the case. A writ of prohibition is an order directed to an
inferior Tribunal forbidding  Page 17 of 53 HC-NIC Page 17 of 53 Created On
Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT it from continuing
with a proceeding therein on the ground that the proceeding is without or in
excess of jurisdiction or contrary to the laws of the land, statutory or
otherwise: Mackonochie v. Lord Penzance, 1881 AC 424 and Halsbury's Laws of
England, Vol. 2, 3rd Edn."
18\. Another judgment relied upon by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
is that delivered by the Apex Court in the case of Thirumala Tirupati
Devasthanams And Another v. Thallappaka Ananthacharyulu And Others \- (2003)8
SCC 134, which, according to him, is delivered in facts similar to those
obtaining in the present case. The Supreme Court has held as below:
> "14. On the basis of the authorities it is clear that the Supreme Court and
> the High Courts have power to issue writs, including a writ of prohibition.
> A writ of prohibition is normally issued only when the inferior Court or
> Tribunal (a) proceeds to act without or in excess of jurisdiction, (b)
> proceeds to act in violation of rules of natural justice, (c) proceeds to
> act under law which is itself ultra vires or  Page 18 of 53 HC-NIC Page 18

Lax use of such a power would impair the dignity and integrity of the
subordinate Court and could also lead to chaotic consequences. It would
undermine the confidence of the subordinate Court. It was not even argued that
there was total lack of jurisdiction in the civil Court. It could not be
denied that the civil Court, before which the suit was pending, had powers to
decide on the maintainability of the suit and to decide on questions of its
jurisdiction. The civil Court had jurisdiction to decide whether the suit was
barred by Section 14 of the said Act or on principles of res
judicata/estoppel. Thus unless there was some very cogent or strong reason the
High Court should not have  Page 19 of 53 HC-NIC Page 19 of 53 Created On Wed
Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT prevented the Court of
competent jurisdiction from deciding these questions. In other words the High
Court should not usurp the jurisdiction of the civil Court to decide these
questions. In the impugned Judgment no reason, much less a cogent or strong
reason, has been given as to why the civil Court could not be allowed to
decide these questions....
... ... ...
22\. We see no reason to express any opinion on the rival submissions. Were we
to express any opinion we would be committing the same mistake that the High
Court has committed viz. usurping the jurisdiction of the civil Court to
decide these questions. We therefore express no opinion on merits.
... ... ...
24\. We are in agreement with the observations of the High Court that grant of
Patta to the respondents was a formality in pursuance of the decisions in the
earlier round of litigation. It is only if it is held that the appellants suit
is maintainable and not barred on principles of res judicata/estoppel that the
appellants can be allowed to pursue the appeal. Thus the writ of prohibition
preventing the  Page 20 of 53 HC-NIC Page 20 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22
00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT Revenue Divisional Officer,
Tirupati from proceeding with the appeal preferred by the appellants against
the order of the Inams Deputy Tahsildar, Chittoor in SR No. 1 of 1995 dated
9­8­1995 must continue for the present. Those proceedings shall therefore
continue to remain stayed till after the final decision on the preliminary
issues. If the preliminary issues are finally answered in favour of the
appellants then the writ of prohibition in respect of the appeal shall
automatically stand vacated. If however the preliminary issues are finally
answered against the appellants the writ of prohibition shall stand
confirmed."
(emphasis supplied)
19\. On the strength of the above submissions, it is prayed on behalf of the
petitioner that the petition be allowed.
20\. Mr.Anshin H. Desai, learned Senior Advocate appearing for respondent
No.5, the only contesting respondent, without prejudice to the rights and
contentions of the said respondent, had initially suggested that, as the
petitioner was admittedly not heard by the SSRD before passing the impugned
part of the order, the  Page 21 of 53 HC-NIC Page 21 of 53 Created On Wed Mar
22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT entire order could be set
aside and the SSRD be directed to hear the parties on the withdrawal
application and pass a fresh order.
21\. This suggestion on the part of learned Senior Counsel Mr.Anshin Desai has
been strongly rejected by Mr.R.S.Sanjanwala, learned Senior Advocate for the
petitioner on the ground that it would amount to setting aside the order of
unconditional withdrawal of the revision application to which the petitioner
has no grievance and which respondent No.5 has never challenged at all.
22\. Consequently, Mr.Anshin H. Desai, learned Senior Advocate, has proceeded
to advance submissions. He has strongly opposed the submissions advanced on
behalf of the petitioner and stated that: (1) Rukhiben, the
predecessor­in­interest of the petitioner, was not a biological daughter of
Chakuji, being the daughter of his wife from a previous marriage. Hence, being
a step­daughter, she had no right of inheritance in the property in question.
Page 22 of 53 HC-NIC Page 22 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT (2) Respondent No.5 was adopted by Gabhaji and
Shakriben, therefore, his name had rightly been mutated in the revenue record
as their legal heir.
(3) The petitioner challenged the mutation entries in favour of respondent
No.5 after an inordinate delay of eighteen years. This aspect has been noted
in the order of the Deputy Collector who has stated that, normally, such a
large delay could not have been condoned. However, the appeal of the
petitioner was entertained on the basis of the declaration purported to have
been made by respondent No.5. The Collector upheld the order of the Deputy
Collector, against which respondent No.5 had filed the revision application
before the SSRD, which came to be withdrawn.
(4) That the application for the withdrawal of the revision application was
made on the ground that civil suits were pending as were the appeals filed by
respondent No.5 against the mutation entries, before the Deputy Collector.
Page 23 of 53 HC-NIC Page 23 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT The said entries were posted without issuing
notice or granting respondent No.5 an opportunity of hearing. These are
independent statutory appeals and respondent No.5 has a right to file them.
Such statutory appeals cannot be prevented from being heard by a Writ of
Prohibition, as prayed for by the petitioner. The legal rights of respondent
No.5 cannot be curtailed.
(5) The declaration being relied upon by the petitioner, which forms the basis
of the order passed by the Deputy Collector and upheld by the Collector, is a
result of threat and coercion as, it was only after a period of nineteen years
that the petitioner chose to file a police complaint against respondent No.5.
The declaration was made under the threat of the police complaint. After the
declaration was made by respondent No.5, the criminal complaint was withdrawn.
Respondent No.5 has challenged this declaration in the civil Court, therefore
no reliance can be placed upon it.

C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT (6) A Writ of Prohibition can be issued only in
the rarest of rare cases and the present case is not such a case. Such a Writ
can only be issued if the authority lacks jurisdiction, if the principles of
natural justice are violated or if there is a violation of fundamental rights.
In the present case, none of these contingencies is present as the appeal of
respondent No.5 is a statutory appeal and the Deputy Collector has the
jurisdiction to hear it. The appeal proceedings cannot be pre­empted in the
manner prayed for by the petitioner. The appeals ought to be heard and decided
on merits by the Deputy Collector, as directed by the SSRD.
(7) The petitioner has suppressed the fact that civil suits are pending
between the parties and a criminal complaint was made by him against
respondent No.5, after a period of nineteen years.
23\. On the above grounds, it is urged that the petition be rejected.

C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
24\. In support of the above submissions, learned Senior Counsel for
respondent No.5 has placed reliance upon the judgments discussed below.
25\. In U.P.Sales Tax Service Association v. Taxation Bar Association, Agra
And Others \- (1995)5 SCC 716, the Apex Court held as below:
> "23. In this case, the respondent­ Association and the advocates resorted to
> boycott the Courts on the specious plea of non­transfer of Satti Din, the
> appellate authority, who seems to be honest and willing to discharge his
> duties diligently.
When the Government stuck to its stand and did not yield to the pressure
despite the strike, the Bar Association filed writ petition in the High Court.
Question is whether the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ
petition and issuing the directions quoted above. The High Court has power to
issue a writ of prohibition to prevent a Court or tribunal from proceeding
further when the inferior Court or Tribunal
(a) proceeds to act without or in excess of jurisdiction, (b) proceeds to act
in violation of the rules of natural justice,
(c) proceeds to act under law which is itself ultra vires or unconstitutional,
or  Page 26 of 53 HC-NIC Page 26 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
(d) proceeds to act in contravention of the fundamental rights, None of these
situations indisputably arises in this case. As noted above, Section 9 of the
Act is a complete code in itself for conferment of jurisdiction on the
appellate authority, the procedure for dispensation and the power to pass
orders thereon. The appellate authority was acting in furtherance thereof. It
has, therefore, to be seen whether the High Court was justified in issuing
orders restraining the authority from exercising those statutory powers and
further to deprive that authority to exercise those powers by transferring the
same to any other jurisdiction.
... ... ...
25\. The decision in Dwarka Nath v. ITO also is of no assistance to the first
respondent. Though this Court was considering the scope and nature of the
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226, there is no doubt now as
regards the scope of the jurisdiction of the High Courts. However wide its
power be, the question is whether a writ or order of prohibition could be
issued prohibiting a statutory authority from discharging its statutory
functions or transferring those functions to another jurisdiction.  Page 27 of
53 HC-NIC Page 27 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
26\. Having given our anxious and careful consideration, we are of the
considered view that the High Court does not have the aforesaid power.
Exercise of such power generates its rippling effect on the subordinate
judiciary and statutory functionaries. On slightest pretext by the aggrieved
parties or displeased members of the Bar, by their concerted action they would
browbeat the judicial officers or authorities, who would always be deterred
from discharging their duties according to law without fear or favour or
ill­will. Therefore, we hold that writ petition is not maintainable. The
impugned orders are clearly and palpably illegal and are accordingly quashed."
26\. On the issue regarding non­issuance of notice, learned Senior Counsel for
respondent No.5 has relied upon the judgment in the case of The Sub­Divisional
Officer (Compensation Officer) Mirzapur and others v. Raja Srinivasa Prasad
Singh reported in AIR 1966 SC 1164, wherein the Supreme Court held as below:
> "12. Here the question is not one of reopening the Compensation Roll or the
> objection case for purposes of making a  Page 28 of 53 HC-NIC Page 28 of 53
> Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
> correction or for review. The question here is that one of the necessary
> parties to the objection cases was neither joined nor noticed to appear. The
> most important party, besides the objector, claiming enhancement of the
> compensation, was the State which has to pay the enhanced compensation. That
> party had to be joined to the proceedings under S. 343 and a notice or
> intimation of the date of the hearing had to be sent as laid down in S. 343.
> Section 343 prescribes not only the manner of serving notices but lays down
> that the State Government must be joined. Every Court and tribunal is
> entitled to reopen a proceeding which has proceeded ex parte, not because a
> party has failed to appear but because a notice has not been sent to a
> necessary party. A decision reached behind the back of a necessary party to
> whom notice must be sent is not binding upon such a party and the Court may
> in such a case reopen the proceeding to give the party a chance to state its
> case."
27\. In Standard Chartered Bank And Others v. Directorate of Enforcement And
Others, reported in (2006)4 SCC 278, the Apex Court held that:
"15. The other set of notices are in respect of the adjudication under Section
50  Page 29 of 53 HC-NIC Page 29 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT of the FERA. Again, it is for the appellants to
put forward their objections thereto before the concerned authority and it is
for that authority to decide the relevant aspects while deciding to impose or
not to impose any penalty on the appellants. The appellants have a right of
appeal under Section 52 of the FERA to the Appellate Board and a further right
of appeal to the High Court under Section 54 of the FERA. We see no
justification for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the authority
under the FERA from proceeding further with the adjudication. It is for the
appellants to put forward their defences, if any available, before the
adjudicating authority and pursue it in accordance with law.
... ... ...
25\. The prayer for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the
authorities under the Act from proceeding with the adjudication and the
prosecution is essentially based on the constitutional challenge to the
relevant provisions of the Act on the ground that they violate Articles 14 and
21 of the Constitution. Once we have held, as the High Court did, that the
provisions are constitutional, the basis on which the writ of prohibition is
sought for  Page 30 of 53 HC-NIC Page 30 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT by the appellants disappears. It is
settled by the decisions of this Court that a writ of prohibition will issue
to prevent a Tribunal or Authority from proceeding further when the Authority
proceeds to act without or in excess of jurisdiction; proceeds to act in
violation of the rules of natural justice; or proceeds to act under a law
which is itself ultra vires or unconstitutional. Since the basis of the claim
for the relief is found not to exist, the High Court rightly refused the
prayer for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the Authorities from
continuing the proceedings pursuant to the notices issued. As indicated by
this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Brahm Datt Sharma ((1987) 2 SCC 179)
when a show cause notice is issued under statutory provision calling upon the
person concerned to show cause, ordinarily that person must place his case
before the Authority concerned by showing cause and the courts should be
reluctant to interfere with the notice at that stage unless the notice is
shown to have been issued palpably without any authority of law. On the facts
of this case, it cannot be said that these notices are palpably without
authority of law. In that situation, the appellants cannot successfully
challenge the refusal by the High Court of the writs of  Page 31 of 53 HC-NIC
Page 31 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT prohibition prayed for by them."
28\. On the aspect that revenue entries are mutated for fiscal purposes and do
not confer any right or title, learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.5 has
relied upon the case of Chhimiben Wd/o. Hirabhai Gopalbhai And Ors. v. State
of Gujarat And Ors. ­ 2006(3) GLR 2455, wherein this Court has held as below:
> "4. It is by now well settled that the entry in the revenue record neither
> confers any additional right over the property nor takes away or alters the
> rights in the property, which otherwise exist as per the provisions of the
> Transfer of Properties Act or other law and such entries are having value

30\. In rejoinder to the submissions advanced on behalf of respondent No.5,
Mr.R.S.Sanjanwala, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, apart from
reiterating his earlier submissions, has  Page 34 of 53 HC-NIC Page 34 of 53
Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
contended that much has been said on behalf of respondent No.5, that is beyond
the scope and ambit of the present petition in which the issue is very
limited. The merits of the case cannot be argued before this Court as they are
not the subject­matter of the impugned order and civil suits are pending
wherein the rights of parties will be finally decided by the competent Court.
31\. It is further submitted by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that
this Court can suitably mould the relief, as required by the facts and
circumstances of the case. Till such time as the Civil Court finally
determines the rights, title and interest of the parties, the Deputy Collector
may be restrained from hearing the appeals. It is submitted that the Supreme
Court, in similar circumstances described in M/s.East India Commercial Co.
Ltd. Calcutta and another v. Collector of Customs, Calcutta (supra), issued
such directions which may be followed by this Court as well.
32\. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has  Page 35 of 53 HC-NIC Page
35 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT further submitted that when, as per the settled position of law, it
is clear that revenue entries are mutated only for fiscal purposes and confer
no right or title to property, there is all the more reason to await the final
decision of the Civil Court on such matters and it may be so directed by this
Court.
33\. Mr.Manav A. Mehta, learned advocate for respondents Nos.6 to 12 in
Special Civil Application No.20096 of 2016, has supported the stand of the
petitioner. Ms.Amita Shah, learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for
respondents Nos.1 to 4 in each petition, has supported the impugned order
passed by the SSRD.
34\. In the background of the above factual and legal submissions, this Court
has heard learned counsel for the respective parties at length and
thoughtfully considered the submissions advanced by them.
35\. As already stated earlier, the respective rights, title and interest of
the parties will be finally determined by the competent Court in  Page 36 of
53 HC-NIC Page 36 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT the civil suits pending between them. Moreover,
these aspects are not relevant for the decision of the legal issues involved
in the present petitions. Issues regarding rights and title of parties were
obviously not involved before the SSRD as well, as the revision was filed by
respondent No.5 against the orders of the revenue authorities setting aside
certain mutation entries.
36\. Though learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.5 has raised questions
regarding the right of Rukhiben, the predecessor­in­interest of the petitioner
to inherit property, issues regarding inheritance are best left for the
determination of the Civil Court. Similarly, the issue regarding whether
respondent No.5 was the adopted son of Gabhaji and Shakriben, from whom he
seeks to derive title and whether the declaration made by him is a result of
threat or force, are also matters with which the Civil Court is seized and is
competent to decide. Submissions of parties regarding issues that are pending
adjudication before the Civil Court  Page 37 of 53 HC-NIC Page 37 of 53
Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT cannot,
therefore, be dealt with on merits by this Court.
37\. This brings us to the core issue involved in the petitions, which is the
legality and validity of the impugned portion of the order of the SSRD,
whereby, after permitting the unconditional withdrawal of the revision
application filed by respondent No.5, the SSRD has proceeded further by
issuing directions to the Deputy Collector to hear the appeals on merits after
granting respondent No.5 an opportunity of hearing.
38\. Having thoughtfully considered the impugned directions in the factual and
legal context of the matter this Court is of the view that, first and
foremost, after permitting the unconditional withdrawal of the revision
application, which part of the order is not under challenge, the SSRD could
not have proceeded to issue any further directions to hear the appeals on
merits. An unconditional withdrawal cannot have any conditions attached to it.
Respondent No.5 may have raised certain issues in the  Page 38 of 53 HC-NIC
Page 38 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT application for withdrawal, such as the pendency of the civil suits
and the appeals filed by him, but once the SSRD permits only unconditional
withdrawal, no further directions can be issued, least of all directing the
Deputy Collector to hear and decide the appeals on merits. This part of the
order of the SSRD is, therefore, legally unsustainable.
39\. Even assuming that the SSRD could have issued such directions after
permitting only unconditional withdrawal, the impugned directions, though
seemingly innocuous, have the disastrous effect of unravelling the entire case
and re­opening concluded issues. It is an order that would have far­reaching
consequences and result in a fresh round of litigation upon issues that have
attained finality. Such a situation is unwarranted in law.
40\. It has to be kept in mind that what was under challenge before the SSRD
were the orders of the Deputy Collector dated 30.03.2012 and of the Collector
dated 12.11.2013, whereby the mutation  Page 39 of 53 HC-NIC Page 39 of 53
Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT entries
in favour of respondent No.5 have been set aside on the basis of the
declaration made by the said respondent on oath, stating that he is not a
legal heir of Gabhaji and the mutation entry in his favour has been wrongly
posted in the revenue record. Respondent No.5 has further stated that he is
neither the owner, nor the occupant, of the property in question. The said
respondent has also made a positive assertion that it is the petitioner who is
the owner of the property in question. In the said declaration, respondent
No.5 describes himself as Amratji Chanduji and not Amrat Gabhaji. The Deputy
Collector has set aside mutation entries Nos.1643 and 1644 posted in favour of
respondent No.5 on the basis of this declaration. The order of the Deputy
Collector has been confirmed by the Collector and both the above orders were
challenged by respondent No.5 in the revision application, which has been
permitted to be withdrawn, unconditionally. Once there is an order of
unconditional withdrawal of the revision application, which order has not been
Page 40 of 53 HC-NIC Page 40 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT challenged by respondent No.5, the orders of the
Deputy Collector and Collector would attain finality. The mutation entries
posted as a consequence of such orders cannot remain the subject­matter of
appeal thereafter.
41\. It is an admitted position that the application for withdrawal filed by
respondent No.5 was not served upon the petitioner, who has admittedly not
been heard before the passing of the impugned part of the order by the SSRD.
The petitioner is not aggrieved by that part of the order directing
unconditional withdrawal. Neither has respondent No.5 raised any grievance
about this part of the order, which is now final. The challenge by the
petitioner is to the latter part of the order that directs the Deputy
Collector (East) to decide the appeals pending before him on merits while
following the principles of natural justice, after permitting the
unconditional withdrawal of the revision application.
42\. As already stated earlier, this part of the  Page 41 of 53 HC-NIC Page 41
of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
order of the SSRD, is unsustainable in law as, once the revision is permitted
to be withdrawn unconditionally, no further directions could have been issued.
In doing so, the SSRD has exceeded the jurisdiction vested in her by issuing
further directions regarding the hearing of the appeals on merits. Apart from
being contradictory and creating an anomalous and unprecedented situation,
there is a patent lack of jurisdiction in the SSRD in issuing the impugned
directions after permitting unconditional withdrawal.
43\. It cannot be overlooked that the appeals pending before the Deputy
Collector (East) are those filed by respondent No.5 against the very mutation
entries that give effect to the orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector,
the challenge to which has been unconditionally withdrawn. When the challenge
to the orders has been withdrawn, they are now final. The entries giving
effect to those orders are consequential in nature and have been made pursuant
to the said orders. The main challenge to the orders  Page 42 of 53 HC-NIC
Page 42 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT having been unconditionally withdrawn, there cannot remain any
further challenge to the entries mutated as a consequence of those orders.
Under the circumstances, the impugned directions issued by the SSRD are
lacking in jurisdiction apart from having been issued in violation of the
principles of natural justice, as the petitioner was never heard. The SSRD
failed to consider that the issuance of the impugned directions would amount
to the re­ opening of issues that have attained finality by her own order of
unconditional withdrawal and would result in opening another avenue for
respondent No.5 to challenge indirectly, the very same issues to which he has
unconditionally withdrawn his challenge. The impugned directions amount to
compelling the Deputy Collector to act beyond his jurisdiction as, if he were
to follow the said directions as he is bound to, it would amount to his
adjudicating upon his own order and that of the Collector, his superior
authority, that have attained finality after the challenge to them stood
withdrawn. The effect of  Page 43 of 53 HC-NIC Page 43 of 53 Created On Wed
Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT the impugned
directions would give rise to a legally impermissible situation that would
result in a cleverly crafted abuse of the process of law, which is required to
be curtailed.
44\. Much has been stated by learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.5
regarding the statutory nature of the appeals filed by the said respondent.
There can be no doubt that the statute provides for the filing of appeals.
However, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, it is clear that the
right given by the statute would be used, or rather misused, by the
adjudication of such appeals that would open up another round of litigation
for respondent No.5 on issues concluded after the withdrawal of his challenge.
Such a manipulation of the statute cannot be permitted by the Court as it
would send a wrong signal to litigants and encourage such clever and ingenious
methods designed to re­agitate concluded issues indirectly, in an attempt to
succeed obliquely in a litigation that has not yielded satisfactory results
for  Page 44 of 53 HC-NIC Page 44 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST
2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT such litigant, even after giving up the
challenge.
45\. Another legal defect in the impugned portion of the order of the SSRD is
that directions have been straightaway issued upon the Deputy Collector (East)
to hear the appeals on merits, after granting an opportunity of hearing
depriving the petitioner of his legal right to raise the issue of the locus
standi of respondent No.5 and/or the aspect of delay. The impugned directions,
apart from being illegal and violative of the principles of natural justice,
are unfair and unjust as well.
46\. Learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.5 has stated that the
declaration made by respondent No.5 is under challenge in Regular Civil Suit
Nos.773 of 2012 and 778 of 2012. That being so, until the Civil Court holds
that the declaration has been fraudulently obtained, its authenticity cannot
be doubted at this stage. It is on the basis of this declaration that the
Deputy Collector and Collector have passed their  Page 45 of 53 HC-NIC Page 45
of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT
respective orders, setting aside the mutation entries in favour of respondent
No.5.
47\. It is a settled position of law that revenue entries are mutated for
fiscal purposes and do not confer right, title or interest upon the property
in respect of which they are posted. When issues regarding the right of
inheritance and title to the property are pending adjudication before the
Civil Court, the revenue entries under challenge by respondent No.5 in the
appeals would be subject to the final outcome of the Civil Suits. Until such
final determination upon these issues is arrived at by the Civil Court, a
second round of litigation to re­agitate concluded issues regarding mutation
entries cannot be permitted. No litigation would ever end if such attempts to
re­open concluded issues are not thwarted by the Court. If the Civil Court
finds that respondent No.5 has a right in the property, the necessary
corrections in the revenue record are bound to be made by the authorities. No
prejudice would occur to respondent No.5 till such time as the rights of  Page
46 of 53 HC-NIC Page 46 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017
C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT parties are finally decided by the Civil Court
as revenue entries cannot take away or alter an existing right or confer any
additional right over the property.
48\. The principles of law enunciated by the Supreme Court on the issuance of
a Writ of Prohibition, as reproduced in the judgments extracted hereinabove,
are well­celebrated and there can be no dispute regarding them. Such a Writ is
to be issued after careful and cautious consideration and not as a matter of
course. One of the contingencies where the High Court is empowered to issue a
Writ of Prohibition is when the inferior Court or Tribunal proceeds to act
without, or in excess of jurisdiction vested in it. In the present case, the
Civil Court is not involved as the impugned directions have been issued to the
Deputy Collector. Under the impugned directions of the SSRD, the Deputy
Collector (East) would be compelled to act without jurisdiction or, in excess
of jurisdiction vested in him by the statute, by hearing and deciding appeals
against the  Page 47 of 53 HC-NIC Page 47 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT mutation entries consequential to his
own order and that of his superior authority (the Collector), both of which
have attained finality. This would go against the very intention of the
statute. It would also amount to an unprecedented situation that is required
to be prevented by the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition. In this view of the
matter, the Court is confronted with a rare and unusual situation that can be
set right only by the issuance of a Writ of Prohibition, moulded to suit the
facts of the present case.
49\. In Thirumala Tirupati Devasthanams And Another v. Thallappaka
Ananthacharyulu And Others (supra), the facts before the Supreme Court were
almost similar to those obtaining in the present case. In the said case, the
land in question was declared as Inam Land in a Ryotwari Village and it was
not held by an institution. Thirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) challenged
the action before the Deputy Tehsildar. After losing before the authorities,
the matter reached the Apex Court in the first round of  Page 48 of 53 HC-NIC
Page 48 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV
JUDGMENT litigation. After the dismissal of the review petition before the
Supreme Court, Tallapaka People filed an application before the Tehsildar for
the grant of a "Patta". The said action was challenged by TTD by filing an
appeal before the Revenue Divisional Officer and also by filing Civil Suits
before the Competent Court. The Tallapaka People challenged the action of TTD
in filing such appeal before the High Court, by seeking a Writ of Prohibition.
The said writ was also sought against the Civil Court. The High Court issued a
Writ of Prohibition and also issued directions. The issuance of a Writ of
Prohibition was challenged before the Apex Court by TTD. The Apex Court
considered it proper to continue the Writ of Prohibition against the Revenue
Divisional Officer and modified the order of the High Court by requesting the
Civil Court to decide the question at issue in the judgment. In the present
case as well, the mutation entry of respondent No.5 was challenged by the
present petitioner before the Deputy Collector. After the declaration by
respondent  Page 49 of 53 HC-NIC Page 49 of 53 Created On Wed Mar 22 00:24:21
IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT No.5, affirmed on 15.09.2011, the
Deputy Collector passed the order dated 30.03.2012, in RTS Appeal
No.1356/2011, setting aside the mutation entries in favour of respondent No.5.
The said order was challenged by respondent No.5 by filing Revision
Application No.249/2012 before the Collector who, by his order dated
12.11.2013, confirmed the order of the Deputy Collector. Respondent No.5,
thereafter, filed a revision application before the SSRD in which no
injunction was granted, in the year 2015. by the order dated 06.10.2016, the
said revision application has been unconditionally withdrawn and thus, the
orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector have attained finality. Before he
withdrew the revision application before the SSRD, respondent No.5 filed RTS
Appeals Nos.182 and 185 of 2016 before the Deputy Collector, challenging the
entries made pursuant to the very orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector
that have attained finality.
50\. Hence, in view of the facts of the present case and the law laid down by
the Apex Court in the  Page 50 of 53 HC-NIC Page 50 of 53 Created On Wed Mar
22 00:24:21 IST 2017  C/SCA/20096/2016 CAV JUDGMENT case of Thirumala Tirupati
Devasthanams And Another v. Thallappaka Ananthacharyulu And Others (supra),
which squarely covers the present case, a Writ of Prohibition is required to
be issued against the Deputy Collector (East), restraining him from hearing
RTS Appeals Nos.182 of 2016 and 185 of 2016, till such time as the rights and
title of the parties are determined by the Civil Court. The revenue entries
impugned in the above­mentioned appeals shall be subject to the decision of
the Civil Suits.
51\. Insofar as the submission regarding the non­ disclosure of the pending
Civil Suits by the petitioner is concerned, this Court does not consider it to
be a suppression of material facts as the petitions are directed against the
impugned order of the SSRD, which is not on the merits of the case. The
non­disclosure of the criminal complaint filed by the petitioner against
respondent No.5 is immaterial as this aspect is not relevant to the decision
of the present petition.
