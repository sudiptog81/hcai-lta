    JUDGMENT
"To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If
by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than
man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's
superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has
she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her,
man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with
woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than woman?"----
Mahatma Gandhi.
1\. This case falls in the list of twenty oldest cases pending before this
Court and a sincere endeavour has been made to dispose it expeditiously.
2\. Kidnapping and rape are dark realities in Indian society like in any other
nation. 53 per cent of our children are sexually abused, according to a
statistic from a survey done by the Government of India. This abnormal conduct
is rooted in physical force as well as familiar and other power which the
abuser uses to pressure his victim. Nor is abuse by known and unknown persons
confined to a single political ideology or to one economic system. It
transcends barriers of age, class, language, caste, community, sex and even
family. The only commonality is power which triggers and feeds rape.
Disbelief, denial and cover-up to "preserve the family reputation" are often
then placed above the interests of the victim and her abuse. (Reliance on the
material on the internet). Rape is an abominable and ghastly and it worsens
and becomes inhuman and barbaric Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

when the victim is a minor female child, as in the present case, who is
allegedly subjected to unwanted physical contact by a perverted male adult.
3\. "Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an accused
on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity.
The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get
swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement
of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw out allegations of
rape. This is all the more important because of lately crime against women in
general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while
we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern
for her honour. It is a sad reflection and we must emphasize that the courts
must deal with rape cases in particular with utmost sensitivity and appreciate
the evidence in totality of the background of the entire case and not in
isolation." The Supreme Court has made the above observations in the judgment
reported as State of Andhra Pradesh v. Gangula Satya Murthy, JT 1996 (10) SC
550.

    CR.P.C.
8\. In his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the accused has
controverted and rebutted the entire evidence against him submitting that he
is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case. He has not committed
any offence. As a matter of fact, the prosecutrix came to be introduced with
him in the month of July 2008 through a common friend Ms. Nisha and
thereafter, prosecutrix became friend of one Ms. Kavita through her friend Ms.
Nisha and started visiting the house of Ms. Kavita at Jaat Chowk, Nangloi,
where he was staying on rent in a room for preparation of his competitive
exams. During such visits of prosecutrix at the house of Ms. Kavita, they
became more close and their friendship turned into a love affair and they had
exchanged their telephone/mobile numbers and used to talk with each other.
After falling in love with each other, they used to meet often and pass time
together and roam to various places in Delhi. Thereafter, in June 2008, the
prosecutrix had shown her willingness to marry with him and since he was also
willing to marry with her, they both started to take advice for the marriage
from known persons and they both were informed that they can get married in
Arya Samaj Mandir and during this course they came across Arya Samaj Mandir,
Nabi Karim to find the process of marriage and there they met the priest, who
informed them that they both have to give affidavits of date of births and of
being major, thereafter they had to filled up separate prescribed applications
giving their respective details, on which date of marriage would be given, on
which day marriage would be performed. After coming across the above process
of marriage, he and the prosecutrix, got prepared their Sessions Case Number :

respective affidavits in June, 2009 itself. It is only during the preparation
of her affidavit by the prosecutrix, he came across her exact year of birth
i.e. 1991. Thereafter, he had to appear in certain competitive exams in the
month of July and mid of August, they could not manage to visit Arya Samaj
Mandir during this period and could visit only on 23.08.2009. Thereafter, they
visited to Arya Samaj Mandir, Nabi Karim on 23.09.2009 and they got married
with each other, in the presence of three persons out of whom one Mr. Vinod
was his friend and rest two were one Ms. Babita and Ms. Nisha, who were the
friends of the prosecutrx. Thereafter, in November, 2009, the family of the
prosecutrix came to know their marriage and they started pressurizing for
hushing up of the marriage and even thereafter, some negotiations between his
family and the family of prosecutrix had taken place, but due to his father
being unable to fulfill their condition, the same failed and finally he had
been falsely implicated in this case. Accused has preferred to lead evidence
in his defence.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
48\. The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution story
especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere variance of the
prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should not lead to the
conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story. Efforts should be made
to find the truth, this is the very object for which the courts are created.
To search it out, the Courts have been removing chaff from the grain. It has
to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out the smear as all these things
clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and dust remains, the criminals are
clothed with this protective layer to receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a
solemn duty of the Courts, not to merely conclude and leave the case the
moment suspicions are created. It is the onerous duty of the Court within
permissible limit to find out the truth. It means, on the other hand no
innocent man should be punished but on the other hand to see Sessions Case

no person committing an offence should get scot-free. If in spite of such
effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains writ at large, benefit of doubt
has to be created to the accused. For this, one has to comprehend the totality
of facts and the circumstances as spelled out through the evidence, depending
on the facts of each case by testing the credibility of the witnesses, of
course after excluding that part of the evidence which are vague and
uncertain. There is no mathematical formula through which the truthfulness of
the prosecution or a defence case could be concretized. It would depend upon
the evidence of each case including the manner of deposition and his demeans,
clarity, corroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a Judge
evoked by the evidence on record. So the Courts have to proceed further and
make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to search out the truth and not
stop at the threshold of creation of doubt to confer benefit of doubt.
49\. Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of both the
sides IDENTITY OF THE ACCUSED
50\. There is no dispute regarding the identity of the accused. It is also not
in dispute that they were known to each other prior to the lodging of the FIR.
He is also named in the FIR.
51\. Therefore, the identity of the accused stands established. Sessions Case

    VIRILITY OF THE ACCUSED
52\. The accused has been medically examined by Dr.Rajesh Dalal (PW9) vide MLC
(Ex.PW9/A) wherein it is opined that "it is nothing to suggest that individual
is incapable of performing sexual intercourse)" PW9 has not been cross
examined by the accused nor the defence of the accused is that he is impotent.
53\. This report indicates that the accused is virile and is capable of
performing sexual act and is capable of committing the act of rape.
MLC OF THE PROSECUTRIX AND FSL REPORTS
54\. The MLC of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW5/A) shows that she does not have any
fresh external injury and the hymen is torn. There is no bleeding or injury or
edema.
55\. Also the FSL reports (Ex.PW20/A and Ex.PW20/B) show that semen could not
be detected on the samples of the prosecutrix including the vulval swabs,
vaginal smears, vaginal swabs, pubic hair, lower inner wear, etc. of the
prosecutrix.
56\. These facts indicate that her version regarding her being raped are false
as had she been actually raped, she would have received some injuries, maybe
minor and the FSL reports would have shown the presence of semen. When semen
is not connecting the accused to the crime, there Sessions Case Number : 30 of

57\. Therefore, it is clear that there is no medical nor forensic evidence
against the accused to indicate that he has raped the prosecutrix.
DELAY IN FIR
58\. The contention of the counsel for the accused that there was a delay in
lodging of the FIR which is fatal to the case is tenable as the prosecutrix
went missing on 07.11.20009 and the alleged first instance of rape was on
13.02.2009 while the FIR has been lodged on 30.03.2010 at 19:30 hours i.e.
after a delay of about four months and twenty three days from 07.11.2009 and
about one year and one and a half months from 13.02.2009. The delay in lodging
of the FIR has been not explained by the prosecution.
59\. The Additional Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, submitted that there
is no delay in the lodging of the FIR as the criminal action was swung into
motion as soon as possible since the parents of the prosecutrix was searching
for her. After she was recovered a compromise was effected regarding which the
accused and his father gave affidavits admitting that the marriage is not
valid and it was only after the accused circulated the photographs and letters
that the prosecutrix approached the police.

60\. The delay in lodging the report raises a considerable doubt regarding the
veracity of the evidence of the prosecution and points towards the infirmity
in the evidence and renders it unsafe to base any conviction. Delay in lodging
of the FIR quite often results in embellishment which is a creature of after
thought. It is therefore that the delay in lodging the FIR be satisfactorily
explained. The purpose and object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the FIR
to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early
information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the
names of actual culprits and the part played by them as well the names of eye
witnesses present at the scene of occurrence.
61\. I find on perusal of the record that indeed the criminal action was swung
into motion after a delay of about four months and twenty three days from
07.11.2009 and about one year and one and a half months from 13.02.2009.
62\. As regards the affidavit of the accused (Ex.PW2/B2) and the affidavit of
his father (Ex.PW2/B1), it may be observed that the stamp papers were
purchased on 16.11.2009, affidavits executed on 22.11.2009 and attested by the
Notary Public on 06.03.2010.
63\. It may be mentioned here that in the cross examination of PW2 a
suggestion has been given to him that the affidavits have been fabricated by
him to explain in the delay while in his statement under section 313 of the
Cr.P.C. the stand of the accused is that he has admitted the signatures on his
affidavit but has denied the contents thereby contradicting his own Sessions

suggestion to PW2. When he has signed on his affidavit then there is no
question of the same being fabricated by PW2.
64\. Further, the prosecution has not been able to give any justified reason
for the stamp papers being purchased on 16.11.2009, affidavits being executed
on 22.11.2009 and being attested by the Notary Public on 06.03.2010 i.e. a
considerable gap between each event.
65\. It is not that every delay in registration of the FIR would be fatal to
the prosecution. Once the delay has been sufficiently explained, the
prosecution case would not suffer. However, it is necessary for the Courts to
exercise due caution particularly in the cases involving sexual offences
because the only evidence in such cases is the version put forwarded by the
prosecutrix.
66\. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported as State of Rajasthan v.
Om Prakash, (2002) 5 SCC 745, has held that in case where delay is explained
by the prosecution in registering the case, the same could be condoned
moreover when the evidence of the victim is reliable and trustworthy. Similar
view was taken in Tulshidas Kanolkar v. The State of Goa, (2003) 8 SCC 590,
wherein it was held by the Supreme Court as follows:
> "The unusual circumstances satisfactorily explained the delay in lodging of
> the first information report. In any event, delay per se is not a mitigating
> circumstance s for the accused when accusation of rape are involved. Delay
> in lodging first information report Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for discarding prosecution case and
doubting its authenticity. It only puts the court on guard to search for and
consider if any explanation has been offered for the delay. Once it is offered
, the Court is to only see whether it is satisfactory or not. In a case if the
prosecution fails to satisfactory explain the delay and there s possibility of
embellishment or exaggeration in the prosecution version on account of such
delay , it is a relevant factor. On the other hand satisfactory explanation of
the delay is weighty enough to reject the plea of false implication or
vulnerability of prosecution case. As the factual scenario shows, the victim
was totally unaware of the catastrophe which had befallen to her. That being
so the mere delay in lodging of first information report does not in any way
render prosecution version brittle.
67\. In the judgment reported as Devanand v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2003
Crl.L.J. 242, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has observed as follows:
> "The above said statement clearly show that at the earliest opportunity the
> prosecutrix had not made any complaint to her mother in this regard. Reading
> of the examination-inchief reveals that first time she was raped as per her
> own version after about 30-36 days of coming of the appellant but in any
> case she admits that she has been raped many a times and she only complained
> to her mother few days after he had left. The appellant stayed in the house
> of the prosecutrix for more than year."
68\. Further, the Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan in the judgment reported as
Babu Lal and Anr v. State of Rajasthan, Cri.L.J. 2282, has held as under:
> "No doubt delay in lodging the FIR in sexual assault cannot normally damage
> the version of the prosecutrix as held the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various

such type of delay would certainly be regarded as fatal to the prosecution
case"
69\. The Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the judgment reported as
Banti alias Balvinder Singh v. State of Madya Pradesh, 1992 Cr.L.J. 715, has
held as under:
> "in conclusion, having regard to the conduct of the prosecutrix in not
> making any kind of complaint about the alleged incident to anybody for five
> days coupled with late recording of report by her after five days with false
> explanation for the delay, in the context also of the Lax Morals of the

> intercourse was committed with her by five accused persons or any of them .
> It is also difficult to believe her version regarding the alleged abduction

70\. I find on perusal of the record that indeed the criminal action was swung
into motion after about four months and twenty three days from 07.11.2009 when
the prosecutrix went missing and about one year and one and a half months from
13.02.2009 i.e. the date of first incident of rape.
71\. The prosecutrix has deposed in her evidence that out of fear of the
accused, she did not report the matter earlier to anyone including her
parents. However, it is also clear that after the alleged incident of
13.02.2009, she went to school, went to the market, visited her cousin,
attended marriage, visited friends, etc. (as is borne out of the record). No
explanation is coming forth from the prosecution as to why she did not tell
her anyone about the rape and all the others with whom she may have come

in contact with between 13.02.2009 and 30.03.2010. She was not under the
control of the accused and could have easily disclosed about the incident if
she wanted to. She also did not tell immediately on being recovered. It also
cannot be ignored that the prosecution has neither produced any obscene
photographs or threatening letters nor examined any witness to substantiate
the stand of the prosecutrix. The prosecution has also failed to recover any
pistol, bandook or any other weapon from the accused with which he allegedly
threatened the prosecutrix and therefore, even this stand of the prosecutrix
that out of fear of the accused, she did not approach the police earlier is
not tenable. Further, after she was recovered on 07.11.2009, neither the
prosecutrix nor her parents approached the police. Also even after getting the
affidavits attested by the Notary Public on 06.03.2010, they did not
immediately approach the police. The obscene photographs of the prosecutrix
have also not been recovered with which the prosecutrix was allegedly
threatened. The photographs which are proved in evidence are neither obscene
nor offensive. Even otherwise, there is nothing shown by the prosecution to
connect the accused with any offensive or obscene circulated material. The
prosecutrix, in her evidence has deposed that the accused had sent a complaint
on her behalf to the police which did not bear her signatures and he had got
copies of the complaint and photographs of the marriage circulated in her
village and to the media. Her brother, mama and father went to the accused and
got his signatures on an affidavit wherein he stated that the marriage between
her and him was illegal. If this was so, then the affidavit was got signed on
22.11.2009 and the FIR was lodged on 30.03.2010. The duration of the waiting

22.11.2009 and 30.03.2010 has not been explained. No justified reason is shown
as to why they waited till 30.03.2010 to make the complaint.
72\. Therefore, it can be said that the FIR was lodged after a delay of about
four months and twenty three days from 07.11.2009 when the prosecutrix went
missing and about one year and one and a half months from 13.02.2009 i.e. the
date of first incident of rape which is fatal to the prosecution story. The
delay has not been satisfactorily explained due to which a fatal blow is
struck to the prosecution version.
MATERIAL WITNESSES NOT EXAMINED
73\. The prosecution has failed to produce and examine some material witnesses
whose evidence could have been very relevant in the present case.
74\. Ms.Kavita, friend of the prosecutrix, in whose house the accused
allegedly was a tenant and through whom the prosecutrix had met the accused
has not been examined.
75\. Ms.Babita Rohila, witness of the marriage of the prosecutrix with the
accused, (as mentioned in the marriage certificate Ex.PW16/A, has also not
been examined.

prosecution nor produced nor examined nor any explanation is coming forth from

not examining these relevant witnesses, the prosecution has denied the
opportunity to the accused to make an attempt to elicit the truth in their
cross examination.
AGE OF THE PROSECUTRIX
77\. An important issue in dispute is the age of the prosecutrix. The
prosecution has claimed her date of birth to be 21.03.1993 (as per the
evidence of PW2 and PW3). PW18 had produced the school record of the
prosecutrix to show that her date of birth is 21.03.2013 (admission form-
Ex.PW18/A, MCD date of birth certificate-Ex.PW18/B, ration card- Ex.PW18/C and
school leaving certificate-Ex.PW18/D).
78\. The accused has claimed that she was above 18 years and was a major on
the date of the alleged offence and they were together with the free consent
of the prosecutrix and they had also got married voluntarily.
79\. Here it would be relevant to consider the evidence of DW2 who has
produced the birth register of Nazafgarh Zone year 1992. There is an entry
bearing no. 829, bearing date 28.03.92, showing date of birth as 21.03.92,

80\. In his cross examination by the Additional Public Prosecutor, he has
deposed that he can say from his record that the date of birth of Ms. Preeti
Yadav is 21.03.1992 and the date of 21.03.93 mentioned in Ex.PW18/B is wrong.
He has admitted that there is no over writing in Ex.PW18/B in the date. The
birth certificate is issued by the MCD.
81\. Since the original record of the MCD has been produced, it would be
appropriate that the same is taken into consideration and all the other
records and the evidence are ignored. The information regarding the birth of
the prosecutrix has been to the MCD by her father on 28.03.1992 immediately
after her birth on 21.03.1992. There are some other entries of 28.03.1992
which indicate that there is no possibility of the record being tampered. Even
otherwise, when this record was prepared as way back as on 28.03.1992, there
is no question of the birth of the prosecutrix being on 21.03.1993 since it
was after one year.
82\. There is no reason shown why the parents of the prosecutrix, at the time
of her birth, would furnish a wrong date of birth to the MCD for registration
of her birth as it cannot be presumed that the parents could foresee that
after many years their daughter would be a victim in a rape case in which her
date of birth would be required.
83\. Although the Additional Public Prosecutor has relied on the judgment
reported as Aakash Juvenile through his father Malkhan Singh v. NCT of Delhi,
2013 (1) LRC 109 (Del) and has submitted that the school record should be
given preference, but I am of the considered Sessions Case Number : 30 of

opinion that when the MCD record is available there is no requirement of
considering the school record which is on the basis of the information given
by the parents.
84\. The counsel for the accused has submitted that neither the school record
nor the MCD record produced by DW2 should be considered as the date of birth
of the prosecutrix is 1990 as mentioned in Ex.DW3/2 and Ex.DW3/3 by
Mr.Dharampal father in law of the prosecutrix. However, this contention is not
tenable as neither Mr.Dharampal has been examined by the accused nor any proof
is shown that the prosecutrix was born in the year 1990.
85\. Therefore, in view of the foregoing reasons, it is clear that the date of
birth of the prosecutrix is 21.03.1992. The same would indicate that on
13.02.2009 (the date of first incident of rape), the prosecutrix was aged 17
years, one month and seven days. It also indicates that on 23.09.2009 (the
date of marriage of the prosecutrix with the accused) the prosecutrix was aged
17 years, six months and two days. It also indicates that on 07.11.2009 (the
date when the prosecutrix went missing) the prosecutrix was aged 17 years,
eight months and fourteen days.
DEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED
86\. The accused has claimed in his defence that he has been falsely
implicated in this case. In his statement under section 313 of the Cr.P.C.,
recorded on 03.01.2013, the accused has claimed that the prosecutrix came

to be introduced with him in the month of July 2008 through a common friend
Ms. Nisha and thereafter, prosecutrix became friend of one Ms. Kavita through
her friend Ms. Nisha and started visiting the house of Ms. Kavita at Jaat
Chowk, Nangloi, where he was staying on rent in a room for preparation of his
competitive exams. During such visits of prosecutrix at the house of Ms.
Kavita, they became more close and their friendship turned into a love affair
and they had exchanged their telephone/mobile numbers and used to talk with
each other. After falling in love with each other, they used to meet often and
pass time together and roam to various places in Delhi. Thereafter, in June
2008, the prosecutrix had shown her willingness to marry with him and since he
was also willing to marry with her, they both started to take advice for the
marriage from known persons and they both were informed that they can get
married in Arya Samaj Mandir and during this course they came across Arya
Samaj Mandir, Nabi Karim to find the process of marriage and there they met
the priest, who informed them that they both have to give affidavits of date
of births and of being major, thereafter they had to filled up separate
prescribed applications giving their respective details, on which date of
marriage would be given, on which day marriage would be performed. After
coming across the above process of marriage, he and the prosecutrix, got
prepared their respective affidavits in June, 2009 itself. It is only during
the preparation of her affidavit by the prosecutrix, he came across her exact
year of birth i.e. 1991. Thereafter, he had to appear in certain competitive
exams in the month of July and mid of August, they could not manage to visit
Arya Samaj Mandir during this period and could visit only on 23.08.2009.

Thereafter, they visited to Arya Samaj Mandir, Nabi Karim on 23.09.2009 and
they got married with each other, in the presence of three persons out of whom
one Mr. Vinod was his friend and rest two were one Ms. Babita and Ms. Nisha,
who were the friends of the prosecutrx. Thereafter, in November, 2009, the
family of the prosecutrix came to know their marriage and they started
pressurizing for hushing up of the marriage and even thereafter, some
negotiations between his family and the family of prosecutrix had taken place,
but due to his father being unable to fulfill their condition, the same failed
and finally he had been falsely implicated in this case.
87\. However, the accused has neither led any evidence in his defence to
substantiate his claim nor even put any such suggestions to the prosecutrix
and her parents to prove his defence and these facts indicate that he is
putting up a false defence. The accused has only attempted unsuccessfully to
mislead the Court.
88\. The accused has also failed to show any motive or malafide intention on
the part of the prosecutrix and her parents for implicating him in a false
case. The accused failed to assign any malafide motive to PW4 that she would
get him falsely implicated in a rape case. The defence of the accused does not
appear to be probable.
MENS REA / MOTIVE
89\. Regarding the motive of crime, it may be observed that in a Sessions Case

case based on circumstantial evidence, the existence of motive assumed
significance though the absence of motive does not necessarily discredit the
prosecution case, if the case stands otherwise established by other conclusive
circumstances and the chain of circumstantial evidence is so complete and is
consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and
inconsistent with the hypothesis of his innocence.
90\. The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding circumstances and such
evidence should from one of the links to the chain of circumstantial evidence.
The proof of motive would only strengthen the prosecution case and fortify the
court in its ultimate conclusion but in the absence of any connecting evidence
or link which would be sufficient in itself from the face of it, the accused
cannot be convicted. Motives of men are often subjective, submerged and
unnameable to easy proof that courts have to go without clear evidence thereon
if other clinching evidence exists. A motive is indicated to heighten the
probability that the offence was committed by the person who was impelled by
the motive but if the crime is alleged to have been committed for a particular
motive, it is relevant to inquire whether the pattern of the crime fits in
which the alleged motive.
91\. In the present case there is sufficient evidence on record to show that
the accused did not have a motive to commit the offence. A witness is normally
to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources which are
likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause, such
as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate Sessions Case Number : 30

him falsely. Ordinarily a close relation would be the last to screen the real
culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings
run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency to
drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the
guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of
relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.
However, there can be no sweeping generalization. Each case must be judged on
its own facts. These observations are only made to combat what is so often put
forward in cases as a general rule of prudence. There is no such general rule.
Each case must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.
92\. In the present case, a story has been projected that the accused has
kidnapped and raped the prosecutrix and this version appears to be untrue as
there is no reason why he would do so. There does not appear to be any
criminal intention and mens rea on the part of the accused.
OFFENCE OF INTOXICATION, RAPE, KIDNAPPING AND THREAT
93\. It is necessary to understand the relevant sections before considering
whether or not the offence is proved to have been committed by the accused.

97\. It is a case of heinous crime of rape, which caries grave implication for
the accused, if convicted. Therefore, for convicting any person for the said
offence, the degree of proof has to be that the of a high standard and not
mere possibility of committing the said offence. In a criminal case, the
prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused
and not merely dwell upon the shortcoming of defence.
98\. If one integral part of the story put forth by witness was not
believable, then the entire case fails. It is settled law that where witness
makes two inconsistencies statements in their evidence either at one stage of
both stages, the testimony of said witness becomes unreliable and unworthy of
credence and in the absence of special circumstance; no conviction can be
based on the evidence of said witness. For these reasons, therefore, when
learned Trial Judge disbelieved the evidence of prosecutrix and her father in
regard to her father, it was not open to him to have convicted the appellant
on the same evidence with respect to which suffered from some infirmity for
which the said evidence was disbelieved.

STATEMENT AND EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTRIX
100\. It is necessary to discuss and analyse the testimony of the most
material witness i.e. PW1, the prosecutrix, as she has taken different stands
in her statements.
101\. In her evidence before the Court, the prosecutrix has deposed that that
on 13.02.2009, she had gone to the tuition centre for getting her project
made. The accused, Mr.Amit Kumar, who was a teacher in the tuition centre met
her there. On this day, when she went to the tuition centre, the accused gave
her a cold drink. After she drank the cold drink, she became unconscious. She
found her clothes were not in order. When she asked the accused what happened,
he told her kuch nahi hua chakkar aa gaye thay tum gir gayi thi apne ghar ja.
After 02-03 days, the accused again called her to the tuition centre to give
her the project. When she went Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

to the tuition centre to collect the project, he did not give it to her and
told her that he had taken her photographs and video and that in case she did
not obey him, he would show her photographs and video to others. He used to
threaten her that he would get her brothers and sisters killed. He also
threatened to throw acid on her. Due to the threat, whenever the accused
called her, she used to go on his asking to meet him.
102\. On 23.09.2009, he forcibly took her to Arya Samaj Mandir, Nabi Karim,
Delhi and got married to her. He gave her age wrongly as being 19 years and he
took her signatures on some papers for the purpose of the marriage. He showed
her some weapon which looked like a bandook and made her pose for photographs
of both of them exchanging garlands. He threatened her that in case she
disclosed anything about the marriage or about the photographs and video made
by him, he would release her photographs and videos to the press and put them
on the internet.
103\. On 07.11.2009, she went to Deep Book Depot, near her house where the
accused met her and told her to accompany him to his tuition centre which he
had opened in Ashok Mohalla. He took her to his tuition centre and did not
allow her to come back home. On the next day, her father, mama (maternal
uncle) and brother went to the house of the accused and his father called him
on his mobile on which the accused took her to Rohtak Road where her father,
brother and mama were present. On the asking of her mama, the accused left
her. She came back home with her brother, mama and father. After few days, the
accused started sending the Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

to the accused and got his signatures on an affidavit wherein he stated that
the marriage between her and him was illegal.
104\. She lodged her hand written complaint in the Police Station (Ex.PW1/A).
She was taken for her medical examination to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital
where she was examined vide MLC. She had given her consent for the

arrested. Three photographs (Ex.P1/C) showing her photo with the accused.
105\. On 13.02.2009, she had gone to the tuition centre of accused at Jaat
Chowk at Nangloi. After giving cold drink to her, when she became unconscious,
the accused raped her. After 2-3 days the accused again called her at his
tuition centre to give the project and there he had shown her obscene
photographs and video which he had taken on earlier occasion. During the
period of 13.02.2009 to 07.11.2009, the accused had physical relations/raped
her four- five times. At one time, the accused had shown her the pistol. On
23.09.2009, he forcibly got married with her and on that day her age was 16
years and 6 months. The complaint addressed to SHO PS Nangloi (Mark X) was

106\. In her complaint, Ex.PW1/A, the prosecutrix has stated that when on
13.02.2009, she had gone to the Tution Centre of the accused, he had given her
a laced cold drink and after consuming the same, she lost consciousness. When
she regained consciousness, she found that her clothes were not in order and
she came to know had been raped by the accused. He told her that she had
fallen down and she should go home. She did not tell anyone out of fear. When
she went to the tuition centre to collect the project, he did not give it to
her and told her that he had taken her objectionable photographs and that in
case she did not obey him, he would show her photographs and video to others
and put them on internet. He forcibly established physical relations with her
and to avoid being defamed, she obeyed him. One day he showed her a small
mouser saying that anyone can die from its bullet. On 23.09.2009, he forcibly
took her to Arya Samaj Mandir, Nabi Karim, Delhi and told her date of birth as
21.08.1991 when she was aged 16 years and six months. He got married to her
and a certificate of their marriage was issued by the Pandit. One boy and one
girl, whom she did not know, were also there. On 07.11.2009, she went to Deep
Book Depot to buy a book and the accused forcibly brought her on his
motorcycle to the Tution Centre. He told her that now they are married and
they will go far away and not return. On the next day, her father and mama

that the marriage was not valid and that he will not trouble them in future.

her house. When she phoned him and confronted him, he threatened to kill her.

deposed that the accused was tenant in the house of her friend and running a
Tution Centre. On 12.02.2009, she had gone to the Tuition Centre of the

clothes were not in order and she felt that she had been raped by the accused.

copies of marriage certificate and photographs of marriage at several places.
Her age at the time of marriage was 16 years and six months.
108\. The version regarding the accused giving a stupefied cold drink to the
prosecutrix and her loosing consciousness does not appear probable and
plausible as neither any intoxicant has been recovered from the accused nor
there is any medical or corroborative evidence.
109\. It may be mentioned here that the hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case
reported as Santosh Kumar v. State, 2008 (4) JCC 2919 has observed that no
conviction can simply be on the basis of the statement of the witness that he
became unconscious because of eating the biscuit or drinking tea offered to
him by the accused as there had to be medical evidence to the effect that the
victim had become unconscious because of consuming any drug or intoxicative
substance etc. mixed with tea or biscuit. No such substance had been recovered
from the accused.
110\. It is apparently clear from the different statements of the prosecutrix
that she is giving different versions of the incident. Some of the major
contradictions and discrepancies are being tabulated below.

111\. As regards the incident of 13.02.2009, the prosecutrix has narrated it
differently in her three statements. In fact, in her statement under section
164 of the Cr.P.C., she has introduced a new date of 12.02.2009. It Sessions

is not a case of lapse of time or confusion as she states that she had gone
again on the next day. This fact itself throws a doubt on the version of the
prosecution.
112\. Then the narration regarding her loosing consciousness after consuming
the laced cold drink and after regarding consciousness is also differently
put. In Ex.PW1/A, she states that she found that her clothes were not in order
and she came to know had been raped by the accused. In Ex.PW1/B, she states
that she found that her clothes were not in order and she felt that she had
been raped by the accused. In her evidence, she does not say anything about
the rape. This is a material contradiction which strikes at the root of the
prosecution case and is a blemish to fatal to be ignored.
113\. The prosecutrix has claimed that the accused had threatened and
established physical relations with her. Had there been any threat, it would
have been only for a particular time and not for an indefinite period. She was
living in a residential area with her family, going to school, going to the
market, visiting her relatives, attending marriage of her cousin (as born out
of her evidence) and could have taken there help if there was any threat or
she needed help.
114\. However, the effect of the alleged threat, has not been disclosed
anywhere. Neither the words used nor the impact of the threat have been
furnished by the prosecution. Merely making a bald allegation that she was

threatened does not suffice for convicting the accused as she remained in his
association for a very long time w.e.f. 13.02.2009 to 07.11.2009 and there was
no reason why she could not have disclosed about the alleged threat to the
family, police, friends, teachers, relatives others with whom she had come in
contact with. The fact that she chose to remain silent, only shows that there
was no danger nor any threat. There should be some positive corroborating
evidence. Her conduct, on the other hand, shows that she herself was in the
company of the accused with her consent.
115\. Also, when it has been observed that neither any intoxicating substance
was administered to her nor she was raped, the question of her being
threatened also does not arise.
116\. Where the evidence of the prosecutrix is found suffering from serious
infirmities and inconsistencies with other material, prosecutrix making
deliberate improvements on material points with a view to rule out consent on
her part and there being no injury on her person even though her version may
be otherwise, then no reliance can be placed upon her evidence. Onus is always
on the prosecution to prove and accused is entitled to the benefit of
reasonable doubt. Case of the prosecution is to be proved beyond reasonable
doubt and cannot take support from weakness of case of defence. In case the
evidence is read in totality and story projected by the prosecutrix is found
to be improbable, prosecution case becomes liable to be rejected. Prosecutrix
knew the accused prior to the incident. If evidence of prosecutrix is read and
considered in totality of circumstances Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

along with other evidence on record, in which offence is alleged to have been
committed, her deposition does not inspire confidence. Prosecution has not
disclosed true genesis of crime. (Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of
the hon'ble Supreme Court reported as Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi),
2012 (5) LRC 137 (SC).
117\. If one integral part of the story put forth by a witness- prosecutrix
was not believable, then entire case fails. Where a witness makes two
inconsistent statements in evidence either at one stage or both stages,
testimony of such witness becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence and in
the absence of special circumstances, no conviction can be based on such
evidence. (Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the hon'ble Delhi High
Court reported as Ashok Narang v. State, 2012 (2) LRC 287 (Del).
118\. It is clear that the prosecutrix had willfully remained with the accused
and had physical relationship with him being a consenting party.
119\. Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the accused is guilty of
the charged offence under sections 328, 376 and 506 of the IPC as the
prosecutrix has made inconsistent statements due to which her testimony
becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence. There is no material on record
that the prosecutrix was forced by the accused.

Pradesh, AIR 1973 SC 2773, in para 25 it was observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India as under:-
> "Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of
> justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence
> adduced in the case one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other
> to his innocence, the view which is favorable to the accused should be
> adopted......"
121\. This brings me to the final question as to whether it was she was
intoxicated, raped and threatened by the accused. In this regard it is no
doubt true that in her statement before this Court she has stated that she had
been taken away by the accused after he administered some intoxicating
substance in cold drink to her but there are several contradictions in her
different statements which remain unexplained and indicate that she was with
the accused voluntarily and without any threat, pressure, influence or
coercion and had physical relations with him.
122\. It may be observed here that consent is an act of reason coupled with
deliberation, after the mind has weighed the good and evil on each side in a
balanced manner. Consent denotes an active will in the mind of a person to
permit the doing of an act complained off. Consent on the part of a woman, as
a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only
after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance
and the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice
between resistance and assent.

others v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1977 SC 381, it was held that where the
story narrated by the witness in his evidence before the Court differs
substantially from that set out in his statement before the police and there
are large number of contradictions in his evidence not on mere matters of
detail, but on vital points, it would not be safe to rely on his evidence and
it may be excluded from consideration in determining the guilt of accused.
124\. In the judgment reported as Suraj Mal v. The State (Delhi
Administration) AIR 1979, SC 1408, it was held that where witnesses make two
inconsistent statements in their evidence either at one stage or at two

petitioner.
126\. Regarding the marriage of the prosecutrix with the accused, it may be
mentioned here that PW 16 Dr.Rishi Pal Shastri who has performed the marriage
has categorically deposed that the marriage was performed with the consent of
both the parties. He made enquiry from the girl before performing marriage and
she was happy. He issued a marriage certificate of Sessions Case Number : 30

Mr.Amit Kumar (accused) with the prosecutrix. (Ex. PW16/A) He had brought the
two applications on the prescribed proforma dated 23.08.2009 (Ex. PW16/B and
C) moved by the prosecutrix and Mr.Amit Kumar and the affidavits of the
prosecutrix and Mr.Amit Kumar (Ex. PW16/D and E) as well as the marriage
register (Ex. PW16/F) and the portion from point A to A has been written by
the prosecutrix in her hand writing and the counter foil of the marriage
certificate to the Court (Ex. PW16/G) which is signed by the two witnesses as
well as the accused and prosecutrix. The application forms are submitted by
the parties who are to marry atleast one month prior to the marriage being
performed and the tentative date of marriage is also mentioned in the
application forms. It is essential that the parties who are seeking to be
married fill the forms personally. Even in the present matter, the application
forms Ex. PW16/B and C have been filled by the accused and the prosecutrix.
These facts shows that the prosecutrix had actively participated in giving
effect to the marriage.
127\. Further PW13 Mr.Vinod Kumar, a witness to the marriage has deposed that
accused had love affair with one girl, the prosecutrix. The prosecutrix was
happy in getting marriage with accused. The marriage of accused was performed
with the prosecutrix by the Priest of the temple. The photographs were also
clicked of their marriage. Small party was also organized in the temple. He
was not cross examined by the prosecution on his deposition that the
prosecutrix was happy in getting married to the accused.

128\. PW15, Ms.Namita Yadav, cousin of the prosecutrix, has deposed that the
prosecutrix had told her that accused Mr.Amit is her boy friend when she had
come to attend her marriage. Accused Amit had also attended her marriage and
the prosecutrix had shown her the accused when she had come on the dias to
meet her. In her cross examination by the Additional Public Prosecutor, she
has deposed that the prosecutrix, while going to her school passing from there
and used to take away her mobile phone for talking with accused. In her cross
examination on behalf of the accused, she has deposed that since beginning,
the prosecutrix was telling her that she would marry the accused. However, she
did not know when they got married.
129\. It is clear from the evidence of PWs 16, 13 and 15 that the prosecutrix
is not telling the truth about her marriage. It appears that she willingly
accompanied the accused and got married to him. She was neither threatened nor
forced nor enticed into marriage with the accused.
130\. In the light of the aforesaid nature of deposition of the prosecutrix,
PW5, who happens to be the material witnesses, I am of the considered view
that her deposition cannot be treated as trustworthy and reliable. Reliance
can also be placed upon the judgment reported as Suraj Mal versus The State
(Delhi Admn.), AIR 1979 S.C. 1408, wherein it has been observed by the Supreme
Court as:

131\. Similar view was also taken in the judgment reported as Madari @ Dhiraj
& Ors. v. State of Chhattisgarh, 2004(1) C.C. Cases

132\. Where the evidence of the prosecutrix is found suffering from serious
infirmities and inconsistencies with other material, prosecutrix making
deliberate improvements on material points with a view to rule out consent on
her part and there being no injury on her person even though her version may
be otherwise, then no reliance can be placed upon her evidence. Onus is always

knew the accused prior to the incident. If evidence of prosecutrix is read and
considered in totality of circumstances along with other evidence on record,
in which offence is alleged to have been committed, her deposition does not
inspire confidence. Prosecution has not disclosed true genesis of crime.

134\. It is cleat that the prosecutrix had willfully accompanied the accused
and was a consenting party. Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the
accused is guilty of the charged offence under section 328, 366, 376 and 506
of the IPC as the prosecutrix has made inconsistent statements due to which
her testimony becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence.
135\. There is no explanation coming from the prosecution in respect of the
contradictions, as tabulated above. They are too major to be ignored and
strike at the very root of the case making it doubtful as these blemishes are
fatal. The possibility of the false implication of the accused cannot be ruled
out due to the prosecutrix giving different versions of the alleged incident
and the contradictions in the evidence of the prosecutrix and her parents.

unreliable, as already discussed above. Also there are overwhelming
contradictions in her different statements, the conscience of this Court is
completely satisfied that the prosecution has not been able to bring home the
charge against the accused person. The prosecution story does not inspire

indicate that there is no veracity in the prosecution case in respect of the
offences of intoxication, rape and threat and the accused merits to be

foremost requirement of the prosecution is to prove that the prosecutrix was a

State and another Crl. M.C. No. 3073-74/2006 decided on 23.2.2007 took similar
view. Following observations in that judgment are of some interest:
> "There is no law which prohibits a girl under 18 years from falling in love
> with someone else. Neither falling in love with some body is an offence
> under IPR or any other penal law. Desiring to marry her love is also not an
> offence. A young girl who is in love has two courses available to her one is
> that she should marry with the consent of her parents after obtaining the
> consent of her parents. If her parents do not agree to persuade them or to
> wait for attaining the age of majority and then exercise her right as a
> major to marry the person of her own choice. However, this is possible only
> when the house of her parents where she is living has congenial atmosphere
> and she is allowed to live in peace in that house and wait for attaining age
> of majority. This might have been the reason in the mind of petitioner No.2
> when she told her father that she was in love and wanted to marry Sanju, but
> the response of father when daughter confided in him, created the fear in

He, even threatened to kill her and marry her off to some rich person. When
once such a threat is given to a girl around 17 years of age, who is in love,
under such circumstances she has a right to protect her person and feelings
against such onslaught of her relatives even if the onslaught is from her own
parents. Right to Sessions Case Number : 30 of 2013.

life and liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution is equally available to
minors. A father has no right to forcibly marry off his daughter, who is below
18 years against her wishes. Neither he has right to kill her, because she
intends to marry out of her religion. If a girl around 17 years of age runs
away from her parents house to save herself from the onslaught of her father
or relatives and joins her lover or runs away with him, it is no offence
either on the part of the girl or on the part of boy with whom she ran away
and married.."
143\. Similarly in Bhagwan Singh Ors. v. State & Anr. 2006 (3) JCC 2050, the
High Court of Delhi had quashed the proceedings. In this case, the following
portion from the judgment of S. Vardarajan v. State of Madras, 1965 SCR (1)
243 was quoted. I am privileged to quote the same as below:-
> "But when the girl (who though a minor had attained the age of discretion

has willingly accompanies him and the law does not cast upon him the duty of
taking her back to her father's house or even of telling her not to accompany
him.."
144\. In the present case also, there is little material on record that the
prosecutrix was taken or enticed or allured or forced by the accused. There is
also little material on record to show that accused deceitfully took away the
prosecutrix. However, it is also clear that the prosecutrix, a minor, was with
the accused and was recovered at his instance.
145\. Proof of such intention is vital for the purposes of sections 363 and
376 IPC as pointed out by the Supreme Court in Faiyaz Ahmad v. State of Bihar,
1990 Cr.L.J. 2241 (SC). If a girl leaves the house of her parents of her own
and is an adult, and accompanies a person to various places, no offence is
committed under this section or any other section. Reliance can be placed upon
the judgment reported as Om Parkash v. State of Haryana, 1988 Cr.L.J. 1606
(P&H).
146\. In another case reported as Kali Ram Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, AIR
1973 SC 2773, in para 25 it was observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as
under:-
> "Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of
> justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence
> adduced in the case one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other

147\. In her examination in chief the prosecutrix has deposed that the

father, maternal uncle and brother went to the house of accused, where the
father of accused Amit called him on his mobile and accused Amit took her to
Rohtalk Road, where he left her at the instance of her maternal uncle and she
returned home with them.
148\. PW2 has deposed that he along with his relative and father of the
accused went in search of accused and they saw him in a motorcycle at Railway
crossing/Phatak, Nizam Pur and on their pressurizing made a call to his
daughter and called her at Nangloi Market. When they reach Nangloi Market his
daughter was found present and he along with his relative brought his daughter
to the house. Although there is a contradiction whether or not the accused
brought the prosecutrix to Rohtak Road from where she was left with her
relatives by the accused and whether on the telephone by the accused the
prosecutrix had reached the Nangloi Market, but the fact which emerges is that
she indeed was with him and under his control and away from custody of her
parents. Contradictions regarding manner in which the prosecutrix was
recovered is too minor and can be ignored as it is the factum of the recovery
of the prosecutrix from the custody of accused, which is more relevant and
important.
149\. This brings me to the final question as to whether it was she who had
gone of her own or had been enticed away by the accused. In this regard it is
no doubt true that it emerges from the record that the prosecutrix had been
taken away by the accused and was kidnapped by him. She was below 18 years of
age at that time. (Her date of birth has been held above to Sessions Case

days. It also indicates that on 23.09.2009 (the date of marriage of the
prosecutrix with the accused) the prosecutrix was aged 17 years, six months
and two days. It also indicates that on 07.11.2009 (the date when the
prosecutrix went missing) the prosecutrix was aged 17 years, eight months and
fourteen days)
150\. Here, I would like to incorporate the observations made by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in S.Vedarajan v. State of Madras AIR 1965 SC
942\. In para 9 of the judgment it was observed as under:-
> "It must, however, be borne in mind that there is a distinction between
> taking and allowing a minor to accompany a person. The two expressions are
> not synonymous though we would like to guard ourselves from laying down that
> in no conceivable circumstances can the two be regarded as meaning the same
> thing for the purposes of S.361 of the Indian Penal Code. We would limit
> ourselves to a case like the present where the minor alleged to have been

> capacity to know the full import of what she was doing voluntarily joins the
> accused persons. In such a case we do not think that the accused can be said
> to have taken her away from the keeping of her lawful guardian. Something
> more has to be shown in a case of this kind and that is some kind of
> inducement held out by the accused person or an active participation by the
> accused person or an active participation by him in the formation of the
> intention of the minor to leave the house of the guardian.."
151\. It can be assessed from the evidence of the prosecutrix, a minor, that
she had gone with her free will and consent with the accused as she did

not raise any alarm anywhere nor asked for help nor told anyone at any point
of time that she had been kidnapped or raped. As the prosecutrix was a minor
at the time of the alleged offence under section 363 of the IPC, her going
herself with the accused becomes immaterial.
152\. Accordingly, the accused is liable to be convicted for having committed
offence under section 363 of the IPC.
CONCLUSION
153\. Since the prosecutrix as PW1 have not deposed anything incriminating
against the accused in respect of the offence under sections 328, 366, 376 and
506 of the IPC as there are overwhelming contradictions and serious
unexplained inconsistencies in her different statements, the conscience of
this Court is completely satisfied that the prosecution has not been able to
bring home the charge against the accused under sections 328, 366, 376 and 506
of the IPC and the prosecution story in this regard does not inspire
confidence and is not worthy of credence.
154\. Where the prosecutrix had sufficient opportunity not only to run away
from the accused but she could have taken the help of the her family,
teachers, friends, relatives and others with whom she was in touch and medical
evidence also indicated that there were no injuries on the person of the
prosecutrix and there is no corroborative forensic evidence, it can be said
that the offence under sections 328, 366, 376 and 506 of the IPC were not
committed.

155\. From the above discussion, it is clear that the evidence of the
prosecution is neither reliable nor believable and is not trustworthy
regarding the veracity of the prosecution case and the prosecution has failed
to establish administration of intoxicant, rape, enticing for marriage or
threat by the accused. The gaps in the prosecution evidence, the several
discrepancies in the evidence and other circumstances make it highly
improbable that such an incident ever took place.
156\. However, the charge for the offence under section 363 of the IPC has
been successfully proved by the prosecution against the accused that he had
kidnapped the minor prosecutrix.
157\. In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharastra, AIR 1984
SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests which are prerequisites before
conviction should be recorded, which are as under:
> 1\. The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn
> should be fully established. The circumstances concerned 'must or should'
> and not 'may be' established;
> 2\. The facts so established should be consistent onlywith the hypothesis of

> 3\. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency;

and

of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have
been done by the accused.
158\. Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present case, it is
evident that the identity of the accused Mr.Amit Kumar stands established. He
was known to the prosecutrix even prior to the incident. It also stands
established that the prosecutrix was a minor at the time of the alleged
incident. It also stands established that the accused had not raped her as
there is no incriminating evidence against the accused. It also stands proved
that the minor prosecutrix was taken out of the custody of her parents by the
accused and she was recovered from his custody.
159\. From the above discussion, it is clear that the evidence of the
prosecution is neither reliable nor believable and is not trustworthy and the
prosecution has failed to establish rape. The gaps in the prosecution
evidence, the several discrepancies in the evidence and other circumstances
make it highly improbable that such an incident of rape ever took place.
Therefore, there is no force is the contention of the Additional Public
Prosecutor that the prosecutrix was intoxicated, raped, enticed for marriage
or threatened.
160\. Also, from the foregoing discussion, it is clear that as the prosecutrix
was a minor at the time of the alleged offence under section 363 of the IPC,
her going herself with the accused becomes immaterial and the accused is
liable to be convicted for having committed offence under Sessions Case Number

161\. Therefore, in view of above discussion, the conscience of this Court is
completely satisfied that the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge
against the accused for the offence under sections 328, 366, 376 and 506 of
the IPC and the prosecution has successfully brought home the charge against
the accused for the offence under section 363 of the IPC.
162\. Accordingly, Mr.Amit Kumar, the accused, is hereby acquitted of the
charge under sections 328, 366, 376 and 506 of the IPC and convicted for the
offence under section 363 of the IPC.
163\. It would not be out of place to mention here that today there is so much
public outrage and a hue and cry being raised everywhere that Courts are not
convicting the rape accused. However, no man, accused of rape, can be
convicted if the witnesses do not support the prosecution case or give quality
evidence, as in the present case where the evidence of the prosecutrix is
unreliable and untrustworthy, as already discussed above. It should not be
ignored that the Court has to confine itself to the ambit of law and the
contents of the file as well as the testimonies of the witnesses and is not to
be swayed by emotions or reporting in the media.
164\. Case property be confiscated and be destroyed after expiry of period of
limitation of appeal.

    ORDER ON SENTENCE
1\. In pursuance of judgment dated 23.05.2013 as passed by this Court
convicting the accused namely Mr.Amit Kumar for offence punishable under
section 363 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the IPC), I
have heard the Additional Public Prosecutor for the State as well as the
convict and the counsel for the convict on the point of quantum of sentence to
be awarded to the convict and also perused the case record.
2\. The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested for the
maximum sentence to be imposed upon the convict submitting that he does not
deserve any leniency keeping in view the offence committed by him.
3\. The convict and his counsel, on the other hand, have requested for a
lenient view to be taken against him and for his release on probation as the
convict hails from a modest family. He is an unmarried young man, aged about
31 years. He was not working and appearing in competitive examinations. His
family comprises of his parents, brother and sister. He was in custody w.e.f.
01.04.2010 to 12.05.2010. He is a first offender and has never committed any
offence earlier. It is also assured that he shall not commit any offence in
future.
4\. Considering the aforesaid submissions from both the sides, the family
circumstances of the convict and perusing the case record, I consider Sessions

    it proper to award a substantive sentence upon the convict.                 The
prosecutrix, a minor, has been taken away from the custody of her parents by
the convict.
5\. Keeping in view the offence committed by the convict, I am not inclined to
take a lenient view against him and release him on probation. He has kidnapped
a minor girl who was vulnerable and an easy prey. I am of the considered
opinion that the convict should be awarded a substantive, stern and firm
sentence because he has kidnapped the prosecutrix.
6\. The object of sentence should be to protect the society and to deter the
criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate
sentence. The Courts are expected to operate the sentencing system so as to
impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the society and
sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. To show mercy in the
case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of justice and the plea for
leniency is wholly misplaced. The welfare and interest of other women in the
society also needs to be protected for the reason that if the convict is
released, they may be subjected by him in a similar offence with them.
7\. In AIR 2000, Supreme Court, 1470, the Supreme Court held has under:
> Socio-economic, status, religion, race caste or creed o the accused or the
> victim are irrelevant considerations in sentencing policy.
Protection of society and deterring the criminal is the avowed object Sessions

sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence.
8\. In the present case, the convict has kidnapped a minor girl taking
advantage of a helpless and defenceless vulnerable prey.
9\. Recently, crime against women generally and rape in particular is on the
increase and the society also appears to be concerned for the honour of women.
In this backdrop, this Court is required to treat the issue with more
sensitivity. The object of sentence is not only required to be reformative but
it should also be punitive, preventive and deterrent. The offences against
women are on a rise and there is an urgent need to curb this tendency by
awarding deterrent punishment to perpetrators of this grave offence.
10\. Therefore, considering these aggravating facts, I hereby sentence Mr.Amit
Kumar, the convict for offence under section 363 of the IPC to simple
imprisonment for the period already undergone by him in custody during the
investigation and trial w.e.f 01.04.2010 to 12.05.2010 and a fine in the sum
of Rs.5,000/- in default of payment of which, he shall undergo simple
imprisonment for a period of one year.
11\. The fine has been deposited by the convict vide receipt number 000991405
dated 23.05.2013 today in the Court. The entire amount of fine Sessions Case
Number : 30 of 2013.
