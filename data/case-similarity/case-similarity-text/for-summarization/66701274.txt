Reserved on 24th October, 2016 Listed for directions on 3rd March, 2017
Pronounced on 29th March, 2017 ORAL ORDER: (Per V.M. Kanade, J.) 1] All these
appeals can be disposed of by a common order since they are arising out of the
common judgment delivered by the learned Single Judge.
Preliminary Objection:
2] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents in
all these appeals has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability
of these appeals. He submitted that in view of language used in Section 13 of
the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division
of High Courts Act, 2015 (hereafter referred to as "Commercial Courts Act"),
appeal against the impugned judgment and order will not be maintainable.
3] Before considering the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly
state the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this preliminary
objection.

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 FACTS:
4] Prior to 1987, a partnership firm was carrying on business in the name and
style of Juggilal Kamlapat Bankers which was reconstituted from time to time
and it was finally reconstituted on 21/02/1980.
5] Sometime in the year 1987, differences arose between the partners of the
firm and on 26/03/1987, a deed of dissolution of partnership was executed
between the partners and the firm was dissolved with effect from 19/03/1987. A
supplemental agreement was also executed on 28/03/1987. Partners agreed to
partition and distribute the immovable properties of the said firm amongst the
partners.
6] Since there was some dispute regarding distribution, the Arbitration Suit
No.1904 of 1992 was filed by Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 for appointment of an
Arbitrator under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The suit was
initially dismissed on the ground of limitation. The matter travelled upto the
Supreme Court and the Apex Court held that the suit was within time and the
disputes between the parties were referred to the arbitration of the sole
arbitrator Mr. Justice S.N. Variava (Retd.).
7] The learned Arbitrator passed an Award on 04/08/2008 and in  4/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:35 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the said Award he was pleased to
order and direct partition and distribution of various immovable properties of
the firm amongst the partners. For the purpose of deciding the preliminary
objection of maintainability of these appeals, it is not necessary to go into
details of the manner of distribution of properties.
8] The Award was challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 and the Petition challenging the said award was
dismissed by this Court on 01/10/2009. Being aggrieved by the said Order, an
appeal was preferred under Section 37 of the said Act, 1996 by the Bombay
Group and Kanpur Group which was also disposed of on 08/03/2013 and therefore
the said Award became executable as a decree.
9] Since the distribution did not take place and the Award was not complied
with, an Execution Application No.2006 of 2015 under Order XXI of CPC was
filed in this Court and the relief was claimed for possession of the Bombay
property. Respondent No.16 also filed Execution Application No.1913 of 2015.
Thereafter, Notice No.1786 of 2015 was issued under Order XXI Rule 22 of the
CPC to all the parties in the Execution Application to show cause why the said
Award was not executable and why warrant of possession should not be issued.
All the parties filed detailed reply to the said notice. Appellants herein
opposed and resisted the execution of the Award on  5/87 ::: Uploaded on -

COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the ground that the obligations of the groups in
the Award were joint, interlinked and interconnected and to be executed and
complied with simultaneously.
10] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents,
has raised a preliminary objection regarding maintainability of these appeals
and his contention is that these orders which are passed in execution
proceedings are not decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Division nor
are orders which are specifically enumerated in sub-section (1) of Section 13.
He therefore inter alia submitted that these appeals are not maintainable.
11] On the other hand, Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of the Appellants has submitted that these appeals are not
restricted either to decrees or orders which are specifically enumerated in
the proviso but also would lie against decision of the Commercial Courts or
Commercial Division which has the effect of attaining finality and even
against such a decision, appeal would be maintainable. It is his contention
that the order passed in execution proceedings is in the nature of final order
affecting substantive rights of the appellants and, therefore, these appeals
are maintainable.
12] We have heard all the parties at length and they have filed their Written
Submissions.

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Submissions of the learned Senior
Counsel Mr. D. D. Madon for Respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in COMAP/4/2016 and for
Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 in COMAPL/5/2016 and COMAPL/6/2016.
13] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Respondents
Nos. 1 to 5 - Kolkata Group made the following submissions:-
> (I) Firstly, he submitted that the objections taken by the Appellants in the
> execution proceedings fall within the ambit of Section 47 Explanation II (b)
> of the Civil Procedure Code ("CPC"), which deals with all questions relating
> to the delivery of property in execution. He submitted that the principal
> objection of the Appellants is that the Respondents are seeking to execute
> only a part of the Award and, therefore, their contention is that the
> obligations of all parties to the Award should be performed simultaneously
> and that the Award should not be executed in parts since the same is
> fashioned as an indivisible whole. He submitted that as per the Amendment
> Act 104 of 1976, determination of any questions within "Section 47" of the
> CPC were omitted from the definition of the word "decree" and therefore no
> appeal under Section 96 of the CPC would lie against the orders passed in
> execution proceedings under Section 47 7/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
> Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:35 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
> COMAPL/6/2016 read with Order XXI Rule 22.
> (II) Secondly, he submitted that the provisions of Letters Patent of the
> Hon'ble Bombay High Court will have no applicability and the provisions of
> the Commercial Courts Act would prevail over the Letters Patent in its
> applicability to commercial disputes. He therefore submitted that no appeal
> could lie under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. He contended that execution
> proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
> (For short "Arbitration Act") are not proceedings under the CPC but under
> the Arbitration Act which is an exhaustive Code by itself and which does not
> provide for any such appeal and therefore applicability of Clause 15 of the
> Letters Patent has been impliedly excluded by Section 37 of the Arbitration
> Act. He relied on the judgment of Jet Airways (India) Limited vs. Subrata
> Roy Sahara 1 (paras 1, 9, 15-30 & 34) in which it was held that LPA does not
> lie since the execution was under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act and not
> under the provisions of the CPC. He further submitted that since no appeal
> had been provided under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, an appeal would
> not be maintainable. He submitted that Division Bench in the case of Jet
> Airways (India) Ltd.

followed the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Furest Day Lawson vs.
Jindal Exports Limited 1 (paras 89-91). He then submitted that in Paramjeet
Singh Patheja vs. ICDS Ltd2, the Supreme Court held that the arbitral award
cannot be considered to be a decree for any purpose for any Central or State
Act.
(III) Thirdly, he submitted that Section 13(2) of the Commercial Courts Act
specifically excludes LPA and therefore in view of binding precedent, the
present execution proceedings were not the proceedings under the CPC but the
proceedings under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act. He submitted that Section
37 of the Arbitration Act does not provide for an appeal from execution
proceedings. He submitted that Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is impliedly
excluded by the Arbitration Act and no appeal could lie from the order in
execution proceedings of an award.
(IV) Fourthly, he submitted that the term "judgment" in Section 13(1) of the
Commercial Courts Act must be given the same meaning and definition as in
Section 2(9) of the CPC and not the expanded 1 (2011) 8 SCC 333 2 (2006) 13
SCC 322  9/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017
01:22:35 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 meaning as under the
Letters Patent.
(V) Fifthly, he submitted that the word "decision" in Section 13(1) of the
Commercial Courts Act must be read to mean "decree".
(VI) Sixthly, he submitted that assuming the word "decision" includes judgment
and order even then an appeal would not be maintainable under the Commercial
Courts Act. He submitted that the proviso contained in Section 13(1) provides
for appeals only from certain Orders under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section
37 of the Arbitration Act and since the impugned Order is not a decree, no
appeal would lie in view of proviso to Section 13(1).
(VII) Seventhly, he submitted that the Appellants are not obstructionists. He
submitted that the present Application was tried and determined under Section
47 and not under Rules 58, 98 or 103 of Order XXI of the CPC.
(VIII) Eighthly, he submitted that the Appellants never had vested right of
appeal prior to enactment of  10/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::

COMAPL/6/2016 the Commercial Courts Act in view of the legal position settled
in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra). He submitted that the right of appeal had
been expressly taken away by virtue of the provisions of Section 13(2) of the
Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court
vide its Judgment dated 24/10/2015 in Hubtown Limited vs. IDBI Trusteeship
Service Ltd delivered in Commercial Appeal No.7 of 2016 had held that appeal
would lie from Order granting conditional leave inter alia on the ground that
since the suit was filed prior to the coming into force of the Commercial
Courts Act, the Appellants had vested right of appeal. He submitted that, in
the present case, there was no right of appeal available to the Appellants
prior to coming into force of the Commercial Courts Act.
Submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar, for the
Appellant in COMAPL/5/2016.
14] Mr. Virag Tulzapurkar the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the Appellants made the following submissions:-
> (A) Firstly, he submitted that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act is a
> sole provision providing  11/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded
> on - 30/03/2017 01:22:35 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 for
> governing the appeals under the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that the
> said Section including its heading, uses the expression "decision", "decree"
> or a "judgment" or an "order". He contended that the expression "decision"
> in Section 13(1) of the said Act refers to a decision which has the
> characteristic and quality of finality i.e. one which conclusively
> determines the rights of the parties to the proceeding. He submitted that in
> view of Section 13(1), against such a decision, appeal is maintainable and,
> therefore, it is not necessary to refer to the proviso of Section 13(1).
> (B) Secondly, he submitted that proviso to Section 13(1) gives an additional
> right of appeal against such orders as are specifically enumerated (i) under
> Order XLIII of the CPC and (ii) under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and
> merely because "orders" or "decisions" which have attained finality as
> provided under Section 13(1) are not mentioned in the proviso, appeal
> against such orders would not be excluded under Section 13 of the Commercial
> Courts Act. He, therefore, submitted that the proviso to Section 13(1) has
> to be read as an independent statutory enactment  12/87 ::: Uploaded on -

> Gopal vs. VI Additional District Judge and Ors3 (Para 7) [4] Swedish Match
> AB and Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India & Anr.4 (Paras 65 &
> 66) He submitted that under the Commercial Courts Act, whether an appeal

He relied on Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that
Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act amends certain provisions of the CPC
in their application to proceedings in the Commercial Courts Act and the
Commercial Court / Commercial Division has to follow these provisions of the
CPC amended by the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that amendments to the
CPC are found in Schedule to the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that, 1

Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:35 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
COMAPL/6/2016 however, there is no amendment in respect of Order XXI of the
CPC. He submitted that all the amendments relate to proceedings upto the stage
of judgment and not thereafter. He submitted that had the Parliament desired
to amend Order XXI Rule 103 to exclude from the expression "decree", the order
passed under Rule 103, it would have done so. He therefore submitted that for
the purposes of the Commercial Courts Act any order passed under Order XXI
Rule 103 continues to be a decree for the purpose of an appeal therefrom.
(G) Seventhly, on the point of legal fiction, he submitted that where the
statutory fiction is to be resorted to, full effect must be given to the
statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. In
support of the said submission, he relied upon the following judgments:-
> [1] State of Bombay vs. Pandurang Vinayak and others1 (Para 5) [2] American
> Home Products 1 AIR 1953 SC 244  19/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::

> COMAPL/6/2016 Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr.1 (Paras 56, 57
> and 66) APPELLANTS' RESPONSE TO THE RESPONDENT NOS. 1 TO 6'S CONTENTIONS:
> In reply to the contention of the Respondents that in view of the judgment
> of this Court in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. vs. Subrata Roy Sahara and others2
> the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants has made
> the following submissions:-
(a) Firstly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
(supra) was passed when the Commercial Courts Act had not been enacted and had
not come into orce.
(b) Secondly, he submitted that the statutory provisions considered in the
said judgment were totally different.
(c) Thirdly, he submitted that Section 13 of the 1 AIR 1986 SC 137 2 2011 SCC

Courts Act alone governs the right of appeal to the express exclusion of the
CPC, Letters Patent and the Arbitration Act.
Alternatively, he submitted that decision in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra)
is not good law since it does not take into consideration judgments of the
Apex Court in State of Bombay vs. Pandurang1 (Para 5), American Home Products
Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr2 (Paras 56, 57, 66) and in East
End Dwelling vs. Finsbury3 (Pages 132, 133). He submitted that since these
judgments have not been considered, the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
(supra) is not good law and should be ignored.
(d) Fourthly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
(supra) requires reconsideration since it has overlooked the settled legal
position that the statutory fiction contained in Section 36 of the Arbitration
Act must be given full effect. It is contended that the judgment in Jet
Airways (India) Ltd (supra) holding that execution 1 AIR 1953 SC 244 2 AIR

applications in respect of an Award are applications under the Arbitration Act
and not under the CPC, is erroneous. He submitted that once an Award is
passed, thereafter execution proceedings are under the CPC alone and not under
the Arbitration Act.
(e) Lastly, he submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (supra)
was based upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja
vs. ICDS Ltd.1. He submitted that the said judgment of the Apex Court in
Patheja (supra) is misconstrued and misapplied in the the judgment of Jet
Airways (India) Ltd. (supra). It is submitted that ratio in the judgment of
Patheja (supra) was with reference to notice under Section 9(2) of the
Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 (For short "Insolvency Act") and it was
observed that on the basis of an Award, notice under Section 9(2) of the
Insolvency Act could not be issued since it was not a decree. It is submitted
that in paras 42 and 43 of the judgment in Patheja (supra), the Supreme Court
has expressly observed that an Award is a "decree" for execution purposes. It
is therefore 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322  22/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::

COMAPL/6/2016 submitted that the conclusion arrived at in the case of Jet
Airways (India) Ltd. (supra) is contrary to the decision in Patheja (supra)
Submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe for the Appellant
in COMAPL/6/2016 15] Mr Milind Sathe, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of the Appellant firstly submitted that the notice was taken out under
the provisions of Order XXI Rule 22 of the CPC and this was resisted by the
Appellant herein by raising objections which are in the nature of objections
under Order XXI Rule 97 of the CPC. He submitted that the order impugned in
the appeal is passed on an application which is in the nature of the order
contemplated under Rule 101 of Order XXI. He therefore submitted that the
order is to be treated as decree under Rule 103 of Order XXI. He submitted
that the order impugned in appeal therefore qualifies as "decree" under
section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act. He then invited our attention to
Section 13 of the said Act. While interpreting Section 13, he submitted that
the Section could not be read to mean that only judgment or order is
appealable. He submitted that such an interpretation would lead to a result
that, then decree is not provided as being appealable in Section 13 of the
Commercial Courts Act, which would give rise to a situation that an
interlocutory order is appealable but an order which is in the form of a
decree is not appealable. He submitted that the  23/87 ::: Uploaded on -
29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016
COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 interpretation of Section 13 and the legislative
intent to provide appeal against any "decision" of Commercial Division can
also be gathered from the draft of "Commercial Court Bill" introduced in
Parliament. He submitted that the Bill had used the words "only against" and
"against no other orders" and these words are not incorporated in Section 13
of the Act. He therefore submitted that the legislative intent was to provide
appeal against all decisions. He submitted that so far as proceedings under
Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are concerned, they must be treated as
proceedings under Section 47 and Order XXI of the CPC. In support of the said
submission, he pointed out firstly that Section 36 expressly provides that the
"Award" shall be executable "as if it were a decree" under the provision of
the CPC. Secondly, he submitted that various provisions in Order XXI of CPC
contemplate adjudication of right, title and interest of various parties such
as in Order XXI Rule 58 and Order XXI Rules 97 to 103 of the CPC. He submitted
that these decisions are treated "as if it were a decree of a Civil Court". He
submitted that since the expression in Section 36 of the Arbitration Act "as
if it were a decree of a Civil Court" is sought to be argued as not construing
as a decree then the provisions of Order XXI Rule 58 as well as Order XXI Rule
103 would be rendered nugatory. He therefore submitted that proceedings under
Section 36 of the Arbitration Act must be construed as proceedings under the
CPC. He submitted that the Judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited (supra) has
not taken into consideration these issues and  24/87 ::: Uploaded on -
29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016
COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 therefore is required to be referred to the larger
Bench for reconsideration. Lastly, he submitted that the exclusion of
applicability of the provisions of the CPC under Section 19 of Arbitration Act
is limited to "arbitral proceeding" and not to execution of the Award.
Submissions of the learned Counsel Mr. Zal Andhyarujina for the Appellant in
COMAP/4/2016.
16] Mr Zal Andhyarujina, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant
submitted that the Commercial Courts Act is a specific Act dealing with a
specific types of disputes and the object of the Act was to provide an
independent mechanism for early resolution of the disputes. He submitted that
the plain language of Section 13(1) indicates that "the decision" would
include a "judgment and order". He submitted that the plain language thus is
plenary and wide in nature. He submitted that the term "decision" has been
judicially interpreted. He relied on the judgment in Balanand & Anr. vs.
Devkinand & Ors.1(Paras 5 and 6) and also in Ratan & Co vs. Asst. Registrar of
Trademarks2 (Para 24). He submitted that the proviso to Section 13(1) is an
enabling statutory provision. He submitted that this is also evident from the
express exclusionary language of Section 13(2) which provides that
"notwithstanding any other law in force", no other appeals shall lie. He
submitted that the contrast in the language between the proviso to Section
13(1) and Section 13(2) 1 AIR 1963 HP 30 2 AIR 1977 Delhi 93  25/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 makes it evident that the former is
enabling and the latter is disabling/exclusionary. He then submitted so far as
the appeals under Section 37(1) of the Arbitration Act are concerned, the
Arbitration Act provides that the appeal shall lie from such orders, to the
Court authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court
passing the orders. He submitted that the effect of Section 13(1) of the
Commercial Courts Act on such orders is to make all appeals from those orders
to lie before the Commercial Appellate Division. He submitted that under
Section 37, appeals could be filed from orders of the Court under Section 9
and 34 which was provided in Section 37(1) and also orders of the Arbitral
Tribunal under Section 16 and 17 as specified under Section 37(2). He
submitted that under the Arbitration Act, appeals under Section 37(1) would go
to Division Bench/Appeal Court and the appeals under Section 37(2) would be
heard by the Single Judge. He submitted that however proviso to Section 13
specifically enables an appeal to lie from orders passed by the Commercial
Division under Section 37 of the said Act to the Commercial Appellate
Division. He submitted that such an appeal is in the nature of second appeal
and provides for an appeal where no such appeal previously existed. He
submitted that the Commercial Courts Act, being a more specific and later
central statute, would override the Arbitration Act which was an older and
general statute to the extent of inconsistency and repugnancy. He submitted
that the present appeal is maintainable under Section 13(1) of the said Act
and the proviso  26/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 has no
application to the facts of the present case. Lastly, he submitted that
enforcement of an Award is done in the same manner as if it is a decree of the
Court and therefore all provisions applicable to the enforcement under the CPC
including appeals which are otherwise available would be available to the
parties. He relied on the judgment in SBP & Co. vs. Patel Engineering Ltd.1
(Para 18) and also in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Vindhya Teleinks
Ltd. & Ors 2\. He submitted that the judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited
(supra) requires reconsideration.
REPLY OF MR MADON, THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS TO THE
SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL MR. SATHE & MR ZAL
ANDHYARUJINA, COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT.
17] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
Respondents has also given in detail his reply as to how the arguments made by
the Appellants' Counsel are not tenable. While dealing with the submissions
made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe, he submitted that the
judgment in Jet Airways (India) Limited (supra) does not require any
reconsideration. He submitted that the legal fiction which is created in
Section 36 is for limited purpose and this fiction could not be expanded
further. So far as the submission that certain words such as "and from no
other orders" which were present in the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division
1 (2005) 8 SCC 618 2 AIR 2009 SCC 3284  27/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
COMAPL/6/2016 and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 were
omitted from this Act, is concerned, he submitted that this submission is
incorrect since in the main Act, these words are incorporated which read as
follows:-
"....no appeal shall lie from any order or decree..."
In reply to the submission of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Sathe that
Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and Order XLIII of the CPC only provide for
appeals from orders that have not attained finality, he submitted that Section
37(1)(c ) & Section 37(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act provide for appeals from
orders that finally dispose of arbitration proceedings.
18] Referring to the submission of the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina, Mr.
Madon, the learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents submitted that such
argument is fallacious and based on misreading of the proviso to Section 13 of
the Commercial Courts Act. He submitted that Mr. Andhyarujina wanted to read
the words into proviso as if they they were "an appeal shall lie from all
orders covered under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996" when, in fact,
the proviso clearly mentions that appeal would lie from all such orders that
are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the CPC and Section 37 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. He submitted that if submission of Mr.
Andhyarujina was to be accepted,  28/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
COMAPL/6/2016 provision of Section 37(3) of the Arbitration Act would be
rendered otiose. He submitted that the judgments on which reliance has been
placed by Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina have no application to the facts of the
present case.
FINDINGS:
19] After having heard all the Counsels appearing on behalf of Appellants and
Respondents and having examined their written submissions, following questions
in our view fall for consideration before this Court:-
> QUESTIONS [1] Whether, in an application for execution of an Award passed
> under the Arbitration Act, 1996, an order passed by the learned Single Judge
> is appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as if it is a

20] In order to appreciate the aforesaid questions which have been raised in
these appeals, it is necessary to briefly consider the purpose for which this
Act has been passed and also the Scheme of the Act.
21] The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate
Division of High Courts Act, 2015 was passed by the Parliament on 31/12/2015
and it received the assent of the President on 31/12/2015 and was published in
the Gazette of Government of India on 01/01/2016. The Preamble to the Act
reads as under:-
> "An Act to provide for the Constitution of Commercial Courts, Commercial
> Division and Commercial Appellate Division in the High Courts for
> adjudicating commercial disputes of specified value and for matters
> connected therewith or incidental thereto."
The Statement of Objects and Reasons mentions that the Government had proposed
to provide for speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes and therefore
it wanted to constitute an independent mechanism for their early resolution.
Clause 6 of the said Statement of Objects and Reasons reads as under:-
31/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 :::
> COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 "6. It is proposed to introduce the
> Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of
> High Courts Bill, 2015 to replace the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division
> and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015 which inter
> alia, provides for the following namely :-
> (i) constitution of the Commercial Courts at District level except for the
> territory over which any High Court is having ordinary original civil
> jurisdiction;
> (ii) constitution of the Commercial Divisions in those High Courts which are
> already exercising ordinary civil jurisdiction and they shall have
> territorial jurisdiction over such areas on which it has original
> jurisdiction;
> (iii) constitution of the Commercial Appellate Division in all the High
> Courts to hear the appeals against the Orders of the Commercial Courts and
> the Orders of the Commercial Division of the High Court;
> (iv) the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of such Commercial Courts and
> Commercial Division is proposed as one crore rupees; and
> (v) to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable to the
> Commercial Courts and Commercial  32/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
> Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
> COMAPL/6/2016 Divisions which shall prevail over the existing High Courts
> Rules and other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 so as to
> improve the efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases."
The Preamble to the Act and the Objects and Reasons disclose the intention of
the Parliament that it wanted to provide a separate mechanism for the purpose
of speedy disposal of commercial disputes.
22] "Commercial dispute" has been defined under section 2(c) of the Commercial
Courts Act. The definition reveals that all disputes which are commercial in
nature are included in the said definition. Constitution of Commercial Courts
is provided in Section 3 and it envisages constitution of number of Commercial
Courts at District level and in the High Court which has ordinary original
civil jurisdiction. It provides for constitution of Commercial Division of the
High Court which is presided over by a Single Judge and constitution of
Commercial Appellate Division which is presided over by Division Bench. So far
as Bombay High Court is concerned, it has ordinary original civil jurisdiction
and, as such, the suits and proceedings of commercial nature are to be first
heard by the Single Judge and the appeal is provided to the Division Bench
under Section 3.
23] Section 7 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about jurisdiction  33/87
::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 of Commercial Divisions of High
Courts and mentions that all suits and applications relating to commercial
disputes would be heard and decided by Commercial Division i.e. by a Single
Judge of the High Court. Section 10 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about
jurisdiction in respect of arbitration matters. Clause (1) of Section 10
mentions the arbitration arising out of international commercial arbitration
and clause (2) speaks about arbitration other than international commercial
arbitration.
24] Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act speaks about appeals which arise
out of the matters decided by the Commercial Division in civil suits etc and
also appeals out of arbitration proceedings presided over by the Commercial
Division i.e. Single Judge. It is evident therefore that no separate
provisions have been made for differentiating between civil suits and
arbitration proceedings. Section 13 combines appeals which are filed in suits
and in arbitration proceedings. Section 13 reads as under:-
> "13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions.-
> (1) Any person aggrieved by the Decision of the Commercial Court or
> Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to the Commercial Appellate
> Division of that High Court within a period of sixty days from the date of
> judgment or order, as the case may be:
> Provided that an appeal shall lie from  34/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017
> ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
> COMAPL/6/2016 such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial
> Court that are specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of
> Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and section 37 of
> the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996).
> (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being
> in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no appeal shall lie from any
> order or decree of a Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than
> in accordance with the provisions of this Act."
25] It will also be relevant to look at some of the other provisions viz.
Sections 8, 16 and 21 of the Commercial Courts Act. Section 8 of the
Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-
> "8. Bar against revision application or petition against an interlocutory
> order.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time
> being in force, no civil revision application or petition shall be
> entertained against any interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including
> an order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to
> the provisions of section 13, shall be raised only in an appeal against the
> decree of the Commercial Court.
Perusal of the said sections indicate that a bar has been imposed against
civil revision application or petition against interlocutory order  35/87 :::

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 and it specifies that no civil
revision application or petition shall be entertained against any
interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of
jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to section 13, shall be raised
only in an appeal against the decree of the Commercial Court.
Section 16 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-
> "16. Amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in its application to
> commercial disputes.- (1) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure,
> 1908 (5 of 1908) shall, in their application to any suit in respect of a
> commercial dispute of a Specified Value, stand amended in the manner as

Perusal of the said Section indicates that the provisions of the  36/87 :::

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Code of Civil Procedure will apply to
the extent, as amended in the Schedule. Perusal of the Schedule indicates that
provisions of Order XXI in so far as they relate to execution have not been
amended. The said provisions therefore will clearly apply in respect of
execution proceedings taken out in civil matters.
Section 21 of the Commercial Courts Act reads as under:-
> "21. Act to have overriding effect.- Save as otherwise provided, the
> provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything
> inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in
> force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law for the time

In Section 21, it is provided that the Act shall have effect over any other
laws which are for the time being in force other than this Act.
26] So far as the enforcement of Awards is concerned, under the Arbitration
Act, Section 36 lays down the manner in which the Award can be enforced.
Section 36 of the Arbitration Act reads as under:-
> "36. Enforcement.- (1) Where the time for making an application to set aside
> the arbitral award under section 34 has expired, then, subject to the
> provisions of sub- section (2), such award shall be enforced in accordance

> it were a decree of the Court.
> (2) Where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in
> the Court under section 34, the filing of such an application shall not only
> by itself render that award unenforceable, unless the Court grants an order
> of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the
> provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that
> purpose.
> (3) Upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the

> Provided that the Court shall, while considering the application for grant
> of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due
> regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the
> provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)." [Emphasis

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 28] Upon conjoint reading of the
Commercial Courts Act and the Arbitration Act, it is apparent that provisions
of the Civil Procedure Code in so far as they are not amended by the
Commercial Courts Act, will apply and more particularly they would apply for
the enforcement of the Award as if it was a decree of the Court. Legal fiction
therefore is created by the Statute and the Award has to be enforced by
following the provisions of the CPC relating to execution of decrees.
29] The last Section under the Arbitration Act which is relevant is Section
37. This Section speaks about appealable orders. It reads as under:-
> "37. Appealable orders.- (1) An appeal shall lie from the following orders
> (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from
> original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:-
> (a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8;
> (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; (c ) setting
> aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34.
> (2) An appeal shall also lie to a Court from an order of the arbitral
> tribunal-
> (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-

> section 16; or
> (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17.
> (3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this
> section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to
> appeal to the Supreme Court."
Section 37, therefore, lays down the orders against which appeals can be
filed. It is relevant to notice here that no appeal has been provided against
an order passed in execution proceedings. This will have to be kept in mind
while interpreting the word "decision" which is found in Section 13(1) of the
Commercial Courts Act.
30] In our view, since there is no separate provision of appeal against
execution of an Award passed in arbitration proceedings, the word "decision"
will have to be interpreted accordingly.
31] Before we consider the rival contentions, it will be necessary to briefly
reiterate the law of precedent:
The Apex Court in Bank of India and Anr. v. K. Mohandas (2009) 5 SCC 313
observed as follows: (SCC pp. 335-36 paras 54-59) "54. A word about
precedents, before we deal with the aforesaid observations. The classic
statement of Earl of  40/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
30/03/2017 01:22:36 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Halsbury,
L.C. in Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 (HL)], is worth recapitulating first:
(AC p. 506) '...before discussing ... Allen v. Flood [1898 AC 1 : (1895-99)
ALL ER Rep 52 (HL)and what was decided therein, there are two observations of
a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have
very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the
particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the
expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the
whole law, but are governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case
in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an
authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted
for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of
reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every
lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.' This Court
has in long line of cases followed the aforesaid statement of law.
55\. In State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra [AIR 1968 SC 647] it was
observed: (AIR p. 651, para 13) "13. ...A decision is only an authority for
what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio
and not every observation found therein nor what logically follows from the
various observations made in it."
56\. In the words of Lord Denning:
41/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:36 :::
> COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 "Each case depends on its own facts

> even a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect. In deciding
> such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as said by
> Cardozo) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of another.
> To decide, therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the broad
> resemblance to another case is not at all decisive."
57\. It was highlighted by this Court in Ambica Quarry Works v. State of
Gujarat: [(1987) 1 SCC 213] (SCC p. 221, para
18) "18. ...The ratio of any decision must be understood in the background of
the facts of that case. It has been said long time ago that a case is only an
authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows from
it."
58\. In Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. [(2003) 2 SCC
111] this Court held that a little difference in facts or additional facts may
make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a decision.
59\. This Court in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. N.R. Vairamani [(2004)
8 SCC 579] emphasised that the courts should not place reliance on decisions
without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact
situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. It was further observed
that the judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes and the
observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been
stated. The Court went on to say that circumstantial applicability, one
additional or different fact may make a world of difference between
conclusions in two cases." (emphasis in original)  42/87 ::: Uploaded on -

The Apex Court in Zee Telefilms Ltd. and another vs. Union of India and

254\. Are we bound hands and feet by Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002) 5 SCC 111?
The answer to the question must be found in the law of precedent. A decision,
it is trite, should not be read as a statute. A decision is an authority for
the questions of law determined by it. Such a question is determined having
regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. While applying the ratio, the
court may not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced from
the context in which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, as
is well known, must be read in its entirety and the observations made therein
should receive consideration in the light of the questions raised before it.
(See Punjab National Bank v. R.L. Vaid (2004) 7 SCC 698).
255\. Although decisions are galore on this point, we may refer to a recent
one in State of Gujarat v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V.S.
Mahamandal (2004) 5 SCC 155 wherein this Court held : (SCC p. 172, para 19)
"It is trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a
judgment should not be read divorced from the context in which it was used."
256\. It is further well settled that a decision is not an authority for a
proposition which did not fall for its consideration. It is also a trite law
that a point not raised before a court would not be an authority on the said
question. In A- One Granites v. State of U.P. (2001) 3 SCC 537  47/87 :::

Lancaster Motor Co.
(London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd. (1941) 1 KB 675 and it was laid down that when

[See also State of U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. (1991) 4 SCC 139,

SCC 42, See para 42.]"
The view of the Apex Court on the law of precedents has to be kept in mind
while dealing with the judgments relied upon by all the parties.
32] We have now to consider the scope and ambit of an appeal which can be
filed under Section 13(1) out of the orders which are passed in execution
proceedings of an Award.
33] In this context, provisions of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act
will have to be interpreted. Perusal of the said Section indicates that it can
be divided in four parts viz heading, which speaks  48/87 ::: Uploaded on -
29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016
COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 about decrees of Commercial Courts and Commercial
Divisions. The heading is followed by sub-section (1), which speaks about an
appeal from the date of judgment or order and it also lays down limitation viz
60 days from the date of the said judgment and order. The third part is the
proviso. The proviso provides for an appeal from orders passed by a Commercial
Division or a Commercial Court and the said appeal is restricted to appeals
which are enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as
amended by this Act and Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996. The fourth part is sub- section (2) which starts with non-obstante
clause and clarifies that no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a
Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with the
provisions of this Act. If we dissect these four parts, it can be noticed that
appeals are provided under sub-section (1) against any decision. In our view,
since sub-section (1) has combined the right of appeal against decree or
order, the word "decision" has been used and the proviso provides for orders
which are appealable. The contention of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior
Counsel for the Appellants, that the word "decision" also includes such
orders, which have attained finality cannot be accepted. This can be gathered
from the Scheme of the Commercial Courts Act and the Objects and Reasons. The
Act was passed for the purpose of speedy disposal of commercial disputes and
to improve efficiency and reduce delays in disposal of commercial cases.
49/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 34] The proviso to sub-section (1)
therefore cannot be said to be an additional enactment provided for appeal
against the orders but it restricts the orders against which appeals can be
filed. In the present case, Section 37 of the Arbitration Act has restricted
the orders against which appeals can be filed. If interpretation which is
sought to be given by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar appearing for
the Appellants, is to be accepted then it would not only be contrary to
Section 37 but would also be contrary to the provisions of the Commercial
Courts Act. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that while
interpreting a particular provision, it is not open for the Court to add or
subtract anything from the said provision. It is therefore not possible to
read something more in the word "decision" to mean that it also includes
orders which are not otherwise appealable. Sub-section (2) of section 2 of the
Commercial Courts Act enumerates that the words and expressions used and not
defined in this Act but defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the
Evidence Act 1872, shall have the same meaning assigned to them in that Code
and the Act. The word "judgment" is defined in Section 2(9) of the CPC.
Therefore, the said restricted meaning has to be assigned to the word
"judgment" found in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act
and it will not be possible to expand the meaning of the word "judgment" as
has been done in the Letters Patent by virtue of the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Shah  50/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Babulal
Khimji1(supra) [paras 112, 1113]. The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants that the expanded meaning
has to be given to the word "judgment" or "decision" therefore cannot be
accepted.
35] In the context of the facts of the present case, it has to be noted that
the Award passed by the arbitral tribunal was confirmed right up to the
Supreme Court and the matter was at the stage of execution. The orders which
are passed in execution proceedings are appealable to the extent provided
under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. An order passed on application under
Order XXI Rule 103 is not appealable under the provisions of the Commercial
Courts Act arising out of execution of an award.
36] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants in
COMAPL/5/2016, Mr. Milind Sathe, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant
in COMAPL/6/2016 and Mr. Zal Andhyarujina, the learned Counsel appearing for
the Appellants in COMAP/4/2016 also laid emphasis on the words "as if it were
a decree" which are found at various places in the CPC and particularly in
Order XXI. It has been contended that the present application has been filed
under Order XXI Rules 98, 99, 100 and 101 and therefore as per the provisions
of Section 103, the order passed is appealable as a decree. Number of
judgments also have been cited by Mr. Tulzapurkar the learned Senior 1 1981 SC
1786  51/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017
01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Counsel appearing for
the Appellants that where legal fiction is created, it must be taken to its
logical conclusion. He submitted that since the provisions of Order XXI are
applicable to Commercial Courts Act wherever words "as if it were a decree"
are used in the CPC, it becomes an appealable decree. In our view, though the
said argument appears to be very attractive at the first blush, on closer
scrutiny, it reveals that the said submission is without any substance. For
that purpose, it will be necessary to see Section 21 of the Commercial Courts
Act which gives overriding effect to the provisions of the said Act. Therefore
as long as this Act does not provide for an appeal against such orders, these
orders are not appealable.
Secondly, it has to be seen that following reliefs were sought in Notice
No.1786 of 2015 taken out by the Appellant in Execution Application No.2006 of
2015 in Arbitration Award dated 4/8/2008.

Appellants are admittedly parties to the Award which has become final. It is
not now open for the Appellants to raise their obstruction and again challenge
the execution of the Award.
37] The contention of Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the
Appellants, and others that provisions of Order XXI Rule 103 will apply is
also without any merit. It is clarified however that, in the present case,
since execution proceedings are in the nature of enforcement of an Award to
which the appellants are parties, they now cannot contend that wherever the
words "as if it were a decree" are used in Order XXI, the same is a decree and
not an order. All the judgments on which reliance has been placed by Mr.
Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants
and others therefore will have no application to the facts of the present
case.
38] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
Respondents has in support of his submissions relied on the Judgment of the
Apex Court in Jet Airways (India) Limited.1 (supra). Division Bench of this
Court in para 15 of the said judgment 1 2011 SC OnLine Bom 1379  54/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 formulated three issues. Para 15 of
the said judgment reads as under:-
> "A. Whether the proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 Act are proceedings
> under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?
> B. Whether the provisions of clause 15 of the Letters Patent are applicable
> to the impugned Judgment and Order and whether applicability of clause 15
> has been impliedly excluded by section 37 of the 1996 Act or by the
> amendment of section 2(2), 47 by Act 104 of 1976 amending the Code?
> C. Whether the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Fuerst Day
> Lawson (supra) is an authority which is applicable only in respect of a
> foreign award covered by Part II of the 1996 Act or whether the ratio of the
> said Judgment is a binding precedent even in respect of proceedings under
> part I of the 1996 Act or the same is obiter dicta?"
Brief facts in the said case are that both the appeals were filed, challenging
the judgment and order dated 04/05/2011 passed by the learned Single Judge in
Execution Application No.161 of 2009 with Chamber Summons Nos. 551/09, 729/09,
603/10 & 477/11 and Notice No.734 of 2009 in Arbitration Award dated
12/04/2007. It is  55/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 not necessary
to further go into the facts of the said case. It is sufficient to point out
that the appeals were arising out of the order passed in execution proceedings
of Award dated 12/04/2007.
While considering the question-A viz. "Whether the proceedings under section
36 of the 1996 Act are proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?",
after taking into consideration various provisions of the Act and relying on
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Paramjeet Singh Patheja1 (supra),
Division Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that the proceedings
initiated by the Appellants and the Respondents before the learned Single
Judge were the proceedings under Section 36 of the 1996 Act and could not be
held to be the proceedings of execution under Section 47 or Order XXI of the
CPC. While coming to the said conclusion, the words used in Section 36 of the
said Act viz. "the award shall be enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (5 of 1908) in the same manner as if it were a Decree of a Court" were
interpreted and reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Paramjeet Singh Patheja2 (supra) and relying on the observations made in the
said judgment and upon independent consideration of provisions of 1940 Act and
1996 Act, Division Bench came to the conclusion that proceedings under section
36 are not the proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure. It further
observed that the Letters Patent Appeal would 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322 2 (2006) 13

01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 not be maintainable in
respect of orders passed under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act.
On the second issue regarding implied exclusion of applicability of Letters
Patent, Division Bench, after relying on judgment in
(a) Union of India vs. Mohindra Supply Company 1, (b) State of West Bengal vs.
Gauranglal Chatterjee2, (c) ITI Ltd. vs. Siemens Public Communications Network
Ltd.3 (d) Union of India vs. Popular Construction Company4, (e) Union of India
vs. Aradhana Trading Co. 5
(f) Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay vs. Patel Engineering Company
Limited,6 had held that Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was impliedly excluded
by 1996 Act. While dealing with the issue of implied exclusion by the Code of
Civil Procedure, after taking into consideration various judgments of the Apex
Court and this Court, Division Bench held that the proceedings under Section
36 of 1996 Act are not the proceedings under the Code and therefore the second
issue had become academic.
Lastly, the Division Bench considered the ratio of the Judgment in Furest Day
Lawson vs. Jindal Exports Limited 7\. In the said case, the question which
fell for consideration before the Apex Court was 1 1961 SCR 497 = AIR 1962 SC

COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 regarding maintainability of the Letters Patent
under Clause 15 of the Calcutta High Court which is in pari materia with that
of the Bombay High Court. In the said case, question before the Supreme Court
was, whether an order, though not appealable under Section 50 of 1996 Act,
would nevertheless be subject to appeal under the relevant provisions of the
Letters Patent of the High Court. Section 50 deals with part II of the
Arbitration Act viz execution and enforcement of the international award. The
Apex Court in the said case came to the conclusion that there was an exclusion
of Letters Patent Appeal. Division Bench relied on the conclusion drawn by the
Apex Court in Furest Day Lawson1 (supra).
39] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the the
Respondents further relied on the judgment of the Apex Court in Paramjeet
Singh Patheja2 (supra). In the said case, brief facts were that the Appellant
was a judgment-debtor and an award was passed against him on 26/06/2000 by the
Arbitrator. On 16/01/2002, an insolvency notice was issued under Section 9(2)
of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of the arbitration
award. Section 9(2) provides that a debtor commits an act of insolvency if a
creditor who has obtained a "decree or order" against him for the payment of
money issues him a notice in the prescribed form to pay the amount and the
debtor fails to do so within the time specified in 1 (2011) 8 SCC 333 2 (2006)
13 SCC 322  58/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017
01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 the notice. The
Appellant filed Notice of Motion in the High Court challenging the said notice
inter alia on the ground that the Award is neither a decree nor an order for
the purposes of provisions of the Insolvency Act and that no notice could be
issued under Section 9(2) on the basis of the Award. Division Bench of the
Bombay High Court held that the Award is a decree for the purposes of Section
9 of the Insolvency Act and that insolvency notice may therefore be issued on
the basis of the Award passed by the Arbitrator. Against the said Order,
appeal was filed in the Supreme Court. In this context the Supreme Court
framed the following questions of law in para 12 of its judgment in Paramjeet
Singh Patheja1 (supra), which reads as under:-
> "12. The substantial questions of law of paramount importance to be decided
> by this Court are :
> (i) Whether an arbitration award is a "decree" for the purpose of Section 9
> of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909?
> (ii) Whether an insolvency notice can be issued under Section 9(2) of the
> Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of an arbitration award?"
The Apex Court, after examining the provisions of the Presidency Towns
Insolvency Act, 1909, Arbitration Act, 1899 and the Civil Procedure Code, 1908
and various judgments firstly came to the 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322  59/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 conclusion that the Award passed
under the Arbitration Act was not a decree and, secondly, it held that the
insolvency notice could not be issued under Section 9(2) of the Presidency
Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of arbitration award.
40] Mr. Madon, the learned Senior Counsel, relying on the aforesaid judgment
therefore submitted that it is a settled position in law that proceedings
under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act are not the proceedings under the
Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and, secondly, that the provisions of Letters
Patent are not applicable and, thirdly, that Commercial Courts Act expressly
excluded applicability of Letters Patent Act under sub-section (2) of Section
13. This submission was sought to be repelled by the learned Senior Counsel
for the Appellants with others on various grounds which are already reproduced
hereinabove. However, in brief, their objections were that (a) firstly, the
said judgment has been passed prior to coming into force of the Commercial
Courts Act, (b) secondly, the said judgment does not consider whether for the
purpose of execution of award provisions of CPC are applicable, (c) thirdly,
the words which are used in section 36 viz "as if it were a decree of the
Court" created a legal fiction and it has to be taken to its logical
conclusion and (d) lastly, the judgment relied in the case of Paramjeet Singh
Patheja1 (supra), the Apex Court has held that an award is not a decree in the
context of issuance of notice under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns
Insolvency Act, 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322  60/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::

COMAPL/6/2016 1909\.
41] Division Bench of this Court in Jet Airways (India) Limited.1 (supra),
after relying on the judgment of Paramjeet Singh Patheja2 (supra), in our
view, correctly held that the provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 and the
Letters Patent have been impliedly excluded by virtue of Sections 36 and 37 of
the Arbitration Act. While doing so, it has examined the said issue from all
angles. Though it is true that one of the issues which fell for consideration
before the Apex Court in Patheja's case was, whether an award is a decree
within the meaning of Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act,
1909 and it held that the Award is not a decree. It also considered the
meaning which is to be attributed to the words "as if" and held that the legal
fiction must be limited for the purpose for which it is created and therefore
the observation made by the Apex Court in the said judgment also will have to
be taken into consideration and more particularly, the observation made in
paras 42 and 43 would be relevant which read as under:-
> "42 The words "as if" demonstrate that award and decree or order are two
> different things. The legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of
> enforcement as a decree.
The fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes under all 1
2011 SC OnLine Bom 1379 2 (2006) 13 SCC 322  61/87 ::: Uploaded on -

COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 statutes, whether State or Central."
"43 For the foregoing discussion we hold :
(i) ........
(ii).........
(iii)........
(iv).........
(v) A legal fiction ought not to be extended beyond its legitimate field. As
such, an award rendered under the provisions of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot be construed to be a "decree" for the purpose of
Section 9(2) of the Insolvency Act.
(vi)
(vii) It is a well established rule that a provision must be construed in a
manner which would give effect to its purpose and to cure the mischief in the
light of which it was enacted. The object of Section 22, in protecting
guarantors from legal proceedings pending a reference to BIFR of the principal
debtor, is to ensure that a scheme for rehabilitation would not be defeated by
isolated proceedings adopted against the guarantors of a sick company. To
achieve that purpose, it is imperative that the expression "suit" in Section
22 be given its plain meaning, namely, any proceedings adopted for realisation
of a right vested in a party by law. This would  62/87 ::: Uploaded on -
29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016
COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 clearly include arbitration proceedings."
42] We are therefore of the view that the words which are used in Section 36
of the Act, particularly the words "as if it were a decree of the Court" do
not mean that wherever appeals are provided under Order XXI against the orders
passed in execution, those appeals would also be maintainable under the
Arbitration Act or under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act. When 1996
Act was passed and thereafter Commercial Courts Act was passed, law makers
were conscious of what "decree" or "order" and "award" are. They were also
aware of fundamental difference between the Courts and Arbitrators as far back
as in 1909 when the CPC was enacted. It will therefore be not possible to
interpret the word "decision" to mean a decree and an order which has attained
finality. If legislature intended to make an order passed in execution which
has attained finality as appealable, it would have done so by providing a
proviso that against such an order passed in execution proceedings which
attained finality of rights between the parties, appeal would be maintainable.
This Court therefore cannot add or subtract something which was not intended
by the legislature. It is further well settled that an appeal is a creation of
Statute and if no appeal is provided, party does not get a right to file an
appeal and no vested right is created in him to file an appeal. The
legislature having expressly and impliedly excluded that right, it will not be
open for this Court to hold  63/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded
on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 that the
word "decision" includes not only a decree but also orders which have attained
finality. It has to be remembered that the Commercial Courts Act was passed
for the purpose of quick disposal of commercial disputes. If the word
"decision" therefore is interpreted to mean that orders which have attained
finality also are appealable, the very purpose for which the Act was passed
would be rendered nugatory, otiose and ineffective.
43] At this stage, it will also be relevant to take into consideration the Law
Commission's Report. While dealing with the question of "appeals",
recommendations of the Law Commission were thus:-
> "(iv) Appeals 3.23.1 The Bill presently provides for a direct appeal to the
> Supreme Court. This is proposed to be replaced with a provision, which

However, when the final Act was passed, it is apparent that the exclusion of
the provisions of the Letters Patent are to be found in sub- section (2). The
said sub-section (2) also starts with a non-obstante clause - notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law - meaning thereby either CPC, Arbitration
Act or the Letters Patent or any other law, no appeal would lie from any order
or decree of a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court otherwise than in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 44] Apart from reasons which we have
given hereinabove, and in addition to that while deciding the question as to
whether "decision" includes "judgment" and "decree", it will have to be
considered whether the word "decision" has to be used in narrow sense or in a
broad sense i.e. whether the word "decision" will have to be read only as a
"decree" or wider meaning has to be given viz that of "decree", "judgment" and
"order" which conclusively decides rights of the parties. Though the Letters
Patent Act is not applicable as it has been expressly excluded under sub-
section (2), it will be necessary to briefly see how the word "judgment" has
been interpreted by the Apex Court. The word "judgment" is narrowly treated
under Section 2 of the CPC. When the said question came up for consideration
before the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra), the Supreme Court in
paras 112 and 113 of its judgment gave a wider meaning and held that those
orders which conclusively decide right of parties could be held to be
appealable under the Letters Patent Appeal, though the word "judgment" is
narrowly construed in the CPC. The Apex Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra)
did not give narrow meaning to the said word "judgment" and, therefore, held
that the orders which conclusively decide right of parties, even if they are
not appealable under Section 104 or Order XLIII, an appeal would lie under the
Letters Patent.
45] The vexed question is whether similar meaning should be given  68/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 to the word 'decision' as is found in
sub-section (1) of Section 13.
46] The question which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in
Tirumalachetti Rajaram vs. Tirumalachetti Radhakrishnayya Chetty and Others1,
was as under:-
> "If the appellate decree passed by the High Court makes a variation in the
> decision of the trial court under appeal in favour of a party who intends to
> prefer an appeal against the said appellate decree, can the said decree be
> said to affirm the decision of the trial court or not under Article 133(1)
> of the Constitution?"
While deciding the said question, the Apex Court also considered the question
as to what is the denotation of the word "decision". In para 7 of the said
Judgment, the Apex Court has observed as under:-
> "7. The next question to consider is : what is the denotation of the word
> "decision" used in the said clause. The argument for the respondent is that
> the word "decision" does not mean the whole of the decision but the decision

> Court in appeal. In support of the argument that the decision does not mean
> the entire decision of the trial court reliance is placed on the provisions

> trial court and not a part of it."
Similarly in para 9 of the said judgment, the Apex Court has observed as
under:-
> "9. The question as to the meaning of the word "decision" in the
> corresponding provision of the Code of 1882 (s. 596) was considered by the
> Privy Council in Rajah Tasadduq Rasul Khan v. Manik Chand [(1902-

From the aforesaid judgment it is apparent that the word "decision" would mean
the entire decision of the Trial Court and not part of it.
Secondly, in Raja Tassaduq Rashul Khan and another vs. Manik  71/87 :::

COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 Chand1, Privy Council, while
considering the definition of the word "decision" has observed as under:-

COMAPL/6/2016 Similarly, the Apex Court in Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. & Anr. vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.1, has considered the meaning of the term
"decision" and in para 28 it has observed as under:-
> "28. It is true that when words and phrases previously interpreted by the
> courts are used by the Legislature in later enactment replacing the previous
> statute, there is a presumption that the Legislature intended to convey by
> their use the same meaning which the courts had already given to them. This
> presumption can however only be used as an aid to the interpretation of the
> later statute and should not be considered to be conclusive. As Mr. Justice
> Frankfurter observed in Federal Com. Commission v. Columbia B. System [311
> US p. 302] when considering this doctrine, the persuasion that lies behind
> the doctrine is merely one factor in the total effort to give fair meaning
> to language. The presumption will be strong where the words of the previous
> statute have received a settled meaning by a series of decisions in the
> different courts of the country;
and particularly strong when such interpretation has been made or affirmed by
the highest court in the land. We think it reasonable to say however that the
presumption will naturally be much weaker when the interpretation was given in
one solitary case and was not tested in appeal. After giving careful
consideration to the view taken by the learned Judge of the Allahabad High
Court in Emperor v. Munnalal [ILR 1942 p. 302] about the meaning of the words
"local area" and proper 1 AIR 1961 SC 652 : (1961) 3 SCR 242  73/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 weight to the rule of interpretation
mentioned above, we are of the opinion that the Constitution-makers did not
use the words "local area" in the meaning which the learned Judge attached to
it. We are of opinion that the proper meaning to be attached to the words
"local area" in Entry 52 of the Constitution, (when the area is a part of the
State imposing the law) is an area administered by a local body like a
municipality, a district board, a local board, a union board, a Panchayat or
the like. The premises of a factory is therefore not a "local area"."
47] From the above decisions it can be seen that the words and phrases
previously interpreted by the Courts have to be used in aid to interpretation
of later statute. The word "decision" therefore in this context would mean a
final decision in the entire suit and therefore a decree.
48] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
Appellants has relied upon the definition of the word "decision" given in
Black's Law Dictionary (9th Edition) and has contended that "decision" would
include an order which finally determines rights of the parties.
It is well settled that definition given by a dictionary cannot override the
interpretation made by the Court in the context of its meaning as used in the
statute and therefore the said submission is unacceptable. It is a settled
position in law that dictionary is a  74/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
COMAPL/6/2016 secondary and external aid to interpretation of statute and
cannot be relied upon when a direct meaning/definition has been in use in law
and/or defined specifically in a statute. It has to be noted here that the
term "decision" was a part of the Code of Civil Procedure 1882 (Section 596)
which was later incorporated in Section 110 of the CPC which is now deleted
and is also used in Article 133 of the Constitution of India.
From the judgments referred to hereinabove, it is clear that it has been
consistently held that the term "decision" appearing in thee provisions means
decision of the suit. The definition of "decision" and "judgment" in Black's
Law Dictionary is therefore contrary to the settled law in India.
49] Mr. Andhyarujina the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the
term "decision" has to be given a wide import and it includes "decree",
"judgment or order". He relied upon the judgment of the High Court of Himachal
Pradesh in Balanand & Anr. vs. Devkinand & Ors1 (paras 5 and 6) and the
judgment of High Court of Delhi in Ratan & Co. vs. Asst. Registrar of
Trademarks2 (para 24).
The said submission cannot be accepted since in para 5 of the said judgment in
Balanand (supra) it has been held that the word 1 AIR 1963 HP 30 2 AIR 1977
Delhi 93  75/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017
01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 "decision" would not by
itself amount to a judgment or order and from para 6 of the said judgment it
can be seen that the High Court of Himachal Pradesh was of the view that a
"decision" was when the suit was disposed of on merits. Secondly, the decsion
in Ratan & Co. (supra) does not take into consideration the provisions of
Section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the provisions of Article
133(1) of the Constitution of India, the provisions of Section 596 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1882 and the judicial pronouncements of the Privy Council
and the Supreme Court.
Therefore the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar
and Mr Milind Sathe and the leanred Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina appearing on
behalf of the Appellants are without any substance and "decision" therefore
being a final decision of the suit is a decree and not an order passed in
execution proceedings.
50] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants relied on
various judgments of the Apex Court regarding the meaning which was to be
given to proviso to Section 13(1). He relied upon the following judgments:-
> [1] The State of Orissa vs. Debaki Debi and Ors1 [2] Commissioner of Stamp
> Duties vs. Alan 1 1964 SC 1413  76/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
> Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016

> Gopal vs. VI Additional District Judge and Ors2 (Para 7) [4] Swedish Match
> AB and Anr. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India & Anr.3 (Paras 65 &
> 66) There cannot be any dispute regarding the ratio of the Judgments of the
> Privy Council and Supreme Court. The Apex Court in Swedish Match AB (supra)
> has in para 43 held that the proviso may serve four different purposes,
> namely :
> (1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the main enactment;
> (2) it may entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the
> enactment by insisting on certain mandatory conditons to be fulfilled in
> order to make the enactment workable;
> (3) it may be so embedded in the Act itself as to become an integral part of
> the enactment and thus acquire the tenor and colour of the substantive
> enactment itself; and (4) it may be used merely to act as an optional
> addenda to the enactment with the sole object of 1 1973 (2) WLR 327 2 AIR
> 1989 SCC 155 3 (2004) 11 SCC 641  77/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 :::
> Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:37 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016
> COMAPL/6/2016 explaining the real intendment of the statutory provisions.
51] In the present case, the said provision if read as a whole and a plain and
grammatical meaning of the said provision is taken into consideration, it can
be seen that the proviso has been used to carve out an exception to the
general rule that an appeal would lie against the decree and only against
those orders which are specifically enumerated in the proviso.
52] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants then relied
on the following judgments on how the heading of the section can be used in
aid of constructing or interpreting the section.
[1] Oulater Hall & Co. Ltd vs. Board of Trade1 (Pages 832 to 833) [2] Inglis
vs. Robertson and Baxter2 ( Page 630) [3] Bhinka and Ors vs. Charan Singh3
(Page 966, para 15) [3] Raichurmatham Prabhakar and Anr. vs. Rawatmal Dugar4

30/03/2017 01:22:38 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 53] From the
conspectus of the cases on which reliance has been placed by the learned
Senior Counsel for the Appellants, it can be seen that the Courts have held
that (i) heading to the section has to be read in conjunction with the main
provision and make the two consistent if possible, (ii) headings are not mere
marginal notes, but the sections in the group to which they belong must be
read in connection with the headings and interpreted by the light of them,
(iv) headings are in the nature of preamble to the section, (v) the headings
prefixed to sections or sets of sections in some modern statutes are regarded
as preambles to those sections. They cannot control the plain words of the
statute but they may explain ambiguous words, (iv) if there is any doubt in
the interpretation of words in the section, heading certainly help us to
resolve the doubt, (v) headings of the title of the section plays a limited
role in the construction of statutes. They may be taken as very broad and
general indicators of the nature of the subject matter dealt with thereunder.
54] From the ratio of the aforesaid judgments, in our view, it is apparent
that heading of the section 13 deals with appeals from decrees and the proviso
to Section 13 (1) carves out an exception in respect of the orders which are
specifically enumerated in Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, against which
appeal can be filed. The word "decision" therefore will have to be interpreted
to mean a decree.
79/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:38 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 55] The next question which has been
argued by the learned Counsels appearing for the Appellants is regarding
definition of the word "judgment". All the learned Counsels for the Appellants
have submitted that the word "judgment" has to be given a wider meaning as
laid down in Radhy Shyam vs. Shyam Behari Singh1 (Para 7) and in Shah Babulal
Khimji vs. Jayaben D. Kania and Anr. 2 (Paras 112 and
113). In our view, reference to these judgments is misconceived. Firstly, the
question which fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in Radhy Shyam
(supra) was : whether the order passed under Order XXI Rule 90 is a "judgment"
and in that context the Apex Court held that Letters Patent Appeal lay against
the order of the learned Single Judge. Similar view was taken by the Apex
Court in Shah Babulal Khimji (supra) in which the Apex Court observed that the
word "judgment" in sub-section (9) of section 2 of the CPC, 1908 has to be
given a narrow meaning whereas the word "judgment" used in Clause 15 of the
Letters Patent has to be interpreted widely. In our view, both these judgments
will not be of any assistance to the Appellants since in the said cases the
word "judgment" was interpreted in the context of the word "judgment" used in
CPC and the word "judgment" used in the Letters Patent. In the present case,
in sub- section (2) of Section 13 the words "Letters Patent Appeal" have been
expressly excluded and as such the word "judgment" which is occurring in sub-
section (1) of Section 13 cannot be given a wider 1 AIR 1971 SC 2337 2 AIR

56] Mr. Tulzapurkar, the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants also
submitted that it is a well-known principle of interpretation of statute that
the construction should not be put upon the statutory provision which would
lead to manifest absurdity or futility, palpable injustice, or absurd
inconvenience or anomaly. He submitted that when a statute enacts that
something shall be deemed to have been done, which in fact and truth was not
done, the Court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purpose and
between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted and full effect
must be given to the statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical
conclusion. He relied on the following judgments:-
> [1] State of Bombay vs. Pandurang Vinayak and others1 (Para 5) [2] American
> Home Products Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories Ltd and Anr.2 (Paras 56, 57
> and 66) In the light of the said judgments, he contended that since section
> 36 in terms state that an award has to be executed as if it is a decree and
> wherever the words "as if it were a decree" are occurring in Order XXI, 1

> COMAPL/6/2016 it has to be treated as a decree and therefore it would be

Reliance can be placed on the following decisions in State of Travancore-
Cochin & Ors. vs. Shanmughah Vilas Cashwnut Factory 2 (Paras 36, 37 and 40)
and in Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay vs. Shakuntala (para 8).
57] So far as submissions of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Milind Sathe are
concerned, he submitted that in the Bill, words "and from 1 (2006) 13 SCC 322
2 AIR 1953 SC 333  82/87 ::: Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
30/03/2017 01:22:38 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 no other
orders" were present whereas they were omitted from the text of Section 13 of
the said Act. The said submission is without any substance since perusal of
the said section clearly discloses that the said words have been incorporated
in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act which read as
under:-
> "13(2) ............ , no appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a
> Commercial Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with
> the provisions of this Act."
He then, submitted that Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and Order XLIII of
the CPC only provided for appeals from orders that have not attained finality.
This submission is without any substance since section 37(1)(c ) and Section
37(2)(a) provided for appeals from orders that finally dispose of the
arbitration proceedings.
58] So far as the submissions of the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina are
concerned, he submitted that Section 13 of the Commercial Courts Act created a
new hierarchy of appeals. He submitted that by virtue of the proviso, even
appeals under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act would lie to the Commercial
Appellate Division. This submission is repelled by the learned Senior Counsel
Mr. Madon appearing on behalf of the Respondents. We agree with the  83/87 :::
Uploaded on - 29/03/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 30/03/2017 01:22:38 :::
COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 submission made by the learned Senior
Counsel Mr. Madon. The proviso clearly states that "appeals shall lie from all
such orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are
specifically enumerated under Order XLIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
as amended by this Act and Sections 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996. The orders passed under Section 37(2) of the Arbitration Act are
not Orders passed by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court and therefore
no appeal shall lie from them to the Commercial Appellate Division under the
proviso to Section 13. If the said submission is accepted then provisions of
section 37(3) would be rendered otiose since it makes it clear that no second
appeal shall lie from the order passed in appeal under Section 37 of the
Arbitration Act. Moreover, there is no provision of appeal from order passed
in execution proceedings under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
59] Mr. Andhyarujina further submitted that section 37(3) of the Arbitration
Act has not been incorporated into the body of section 13 of the Commercial
Courts Act. This submission is fallicious since section 13 includes the entire
section 37 in the proviso and not merely any part thereof. So far as the
judgment on which reliance is placed by the learned Counsel Mr. Andhyarujina
is concerned viz. Shin-Etsu Chemical Company Limited vs. Vindhya Telelinks
Limited 1, in our view, it will not be applicable to the facts of the present
case and therefore cannot be of any assistance to the Appellants. 1 2009 SC

01:22:38 ::: COMAP/4/2016 COMAPL/5/2016 COMAPL/6/2016 60] We do not wish to go
into the question raised by both the parties regarding nature of the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on the application under Order XXI Rule 22.
According to the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Madon for the Respondents the said
order is passed under section 47 which has been excluded from the definition
of "decree' in CPC and therefore is not appealable, whereas according to the
learned Senior Counsel Mr. Tulzapurkar and two other Counsels the said Order
has been passed not under Section 47 but under Order XXI Rules 97, 98, 99, 101
and 103 and therefore the said order is appealable. Reliance has been placed
by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appelalnts on judgments in support of
the said submission. We, however, do not propose to go into the said question
for the reasons stated hereinabove and, secondly, because in our view the
orders passed in execution proceedings of award are not appealable under
Section 37 and therefore it is not necessary to go into the said question.
61] It has to be noted that the question which falls for consideration before
this Court is :Whether, in an application for execution of an Award passed
under the Arbitration Act, 1996, an oder passed by the learned Single Judge is
appealable under Section 13(1) of the Commercial Courts Act as if it is a
decree? And we are called upon to decide the said question only.
