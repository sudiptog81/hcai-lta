    COMMON ORDER
    R.BANUMATHI,J	
Challenge in these writ petitions is the vires of the provision  Section
65(105)(zzzzt) of the Finance Act bringing within the ambit of 'service tax'
certain forms of income generated from "temporary transfer or permitting the
use or enjoyment" of, any copyright as defined in the Copyright Act, 1957(14
of 1957) except the rights covered under Section 13(1)(a) of the said Act.
2\. Introduction - Service Tax on Copyrights:
When service tax was levied on 'Intellectual Property Services' namely
trademarks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible property, with
effect from 10.9.2004, copyright was specifically excluded from the definition
of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). Copyright is nothing but intellectual
property right which explicitly remained outside the scope of service tax just
to encourage authors, artists, etc. The Finance Act, 2010 has levied service
tax on transferring temporarily or permitting the use or enjoyment of any
copyright except the rights covered under section 13(1)(a) of the Copyright
Act, 1957.
3\. Services of copyright are taxable with effect from 1.7.2010. With effect
from 1.7.2010, sub-clause (zzzzt) of clause (105) of Section 65 defines the
"Taxable Service" as under:
"Taxable service" means any service provided or to be provided to any person,
by any other person, for -
(a) transferring temporarily; or
(b) permitting the use or enjoyment of, any copyright defined in the Copyright
Act, 1957, except the rights covered under sub-clause (a) of clause (l) of
Section 13 of the said act."
4\. At the time of introduction of Finance Bill, 2012, in his Speech, Finance
Minister stated that the Year 2012 is the Centenary Year of Indian Cinema and
proposed to exempt the Industry from service tax on Copyrights relating to
recording of Cinematograph films. The Finance Act, 2012 introduced Section 66B
as the new Charging Section with effect from 1.7.2012 for the levy of service
tax on all services other than those services specified in the Negative list.
Notification No.25 of 2012 provided for number of exemptions effective from
1.7.2012 and Entry No.15 of the said exemption is re-produced below:
Temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of a copyright covered
under clause (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Indian
Copyright Act relating to original literary, dramatic, musical, artistic
works.
5\. Notification No.25 of 2012 was amended by Notification No.3 of 2013 w.e.f.
1.4.2013 and Entry No.9 in the notification No.25/2012 is substituted as
under:-
Services provided by way of temporary transfer or permitting the use or
enjoyment of copyright
(a) covered under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Copyright
Act, 1957, relating to original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;
or
(b) of cinematograph films for exhibition in a cinema hall or cinema theatre.
6\. Thus the issue relates to the temporary transfer or permitting the use or
enjoyment of copyright, except the rights covered under sub-clause (a) of sub-
section (1) of Section 13 of the Indian Copyright Act for the period from
1.7.2010 to 31.06.2012 and the period from 01.4.2013 onwards since the levy of
service tax on Copyright Services (Section 65(105)(zzzzt) is revived from
1.4.2013 with the exception of Section 13(1)(a) or Cinematograph films for
exhibition in a cinema hall or a cinema theatre.
7\. Writ Petitions and the averments thereon:-
Contending that the levy of service tax on transfer of copyright, which is
goods, is transfer of right to use the goods amounting to sale and no service
element is involved and that temporary transfer of copyright is not exigible
to service tax, writ petitions are filed challenging the vires of Section
65(105)(zzzzt) and to declare that the provisions of Section 65(105)(zzzzt) is
beyond the legislative competence of the Union of India.
8\. Case of writ petitioners is that Section 65(105)(zzzzt) is beyond the
legislative competence of the Union of India. Under the constitutional scheme,
for the demarcation of taxing powers between the Centre and the State, levy of
sales tax/value added tax on goods, which includes the transfer of right to
use any goods is the exclusvie taxing domain of the States and various States
are currently trading intangibles like "Copyrights" as goods. Copyright is a
form of intellectual property i.e., intangible property and State Legislature
is levying value added tax on these transactions treating it as trading of
goods or transfer of right to use. While on the one hand, assignment of these
rights is treated as sale of goods by the State Legislature(s) and on the
other hand it is treated as providing services, which is ultra vires the
Constitution of India. From 2002, Parliament has amended Central Sales Tax Act
to widen definition of "sale" to cover transfer of right to use the goods in
exercise of powers under Entry 92A of the Union List and the Parliament cannot
now treat the same transaction as "service" for levy of service tax. By
enacting the new taxing entry to levy service tax, on the very same
transaction of the transfer/exploitation of copyrights, the Parliament has
acted beyond its taxing domain under the Constitution of India and
transgressed the taxing domain of the State.
9\. Further case of writ petitioners is that Entry 97 of List I, which itself
mandates that "Union of India may legislate only in respect of any other
matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned
in either of those Lists". As per the Constitution, a sales tax on goods in
the course of intra-State sales is the subject matter of sales in terms of
Entry 54 of List II; Sales Tax on goods in the course of inter-State sale is
the subject matter of Union in terms of Entry 92A of List I and having levied
service tax by treating it as goods the Parliament cannot again call it a
service for service tax levy. Since the tax on the transfer of the right to
use copyright is covered under Entry 54 of List II, the Union is not
competent to levy and/or collect service tax on the transaction under Section
65 of the Finance Act and is beyond the legislative competence of the
Parliament. Contending that the provision of Section 65(105)(zzzzt) is beyond
the legislative competence of the Union insofar as the levy of service tax on
copyright, the writ petitioners seek for declaration that Section
65(105)(zzzzt) is unconstitutional and ultra vires Article 246 of the
Constitution of India read with Entry 54 List II of Schedule VII.
10\. Resisting the writ petitions, the respondents filed counter inter alia
contending that with effect from 1.7.2010, temporary transfer or permission to
use or enjoyment of copyright became a taxable service by insertion of Section
65(105)(zzzzt) in the Finance Act, 1994. While completing transfer or right to
use any goods, "where the original owner completely foregoes the title of a
copyright" may be considered the sale of goods, temporary transfer or right to
use or enjoy copyright for specified purposes are not covered under Entry 54
of Listl II, which is certainly a service provided by the person, who is the
holder of copyright. Service tax is a levy on the charges received from
temporary transfer or for confirmation of right to use or enjoy copyright and
Union of India is well within its rights to charge and collect service tax on
transactions not amounting to sale.
11\. Further, according to respondents, what is sought to be taxed is only the
consideration of service charges received for value addition of assignment of
temporary right or permission to use the copyright. Referring to various
judgments of the Supreme Court, it is averred that Supreme Court upheld the
legislative competence of the Parliament to levy service tax under residuary
Entry 97 of List I of VII Schedule and necessary constitutional amendments
were made giving authority to the Parliament to legislate all service taxes.
The counter statement also refers to the nature of transactions to contend
that they are only a temporary transfer of right or a mere transfer of right
to use or enjoy the copyright for specified purposes, which according to the
respondents, is a service provided by the person, who is the holder of the
copyright.
12\. Heard Mr.M.Venkatachalapathy, learned Senior Counsel; Mr.K.Vaitheeswaran;
Mr.N.Prasad; Mr.Ravi and Mr.T.T.Ravichandran, learned counsels appearing for
the wirt petitioners.
13\. Onbehalf of Writ Petitioners the following contentions were raised:-
Temporary transfer of Copyright is a "transfer of right to use goods" which is
a sale in terms of Article 366(29A) read with Entry 54 of List II of the
Constitution and therefore, it is not a service; that Value Added Tax/Sales
Tax have been imposed on transaction of "transfer of right" to use in the
context of feature film and VAT has domain over the transaction as a form of
levy since copyright is considered as goods and therefore, such temporary
transfer of copyright cannot be considered as goods.
"Temporary transfer of copyright" or "permitting use or enjoyment of
copyright" amounts to sale of goods/deemed sale and intra-State sales is the
subject matter in terms of Entry 54 of List II and sales tax on goods in the
course of Interstate sale is the subject matter of Union in terms of Entry 92A
and having levied sales tax by treating it as goods, the Parliament cannot
resort to the residuary Entry 97 of List I for service tax levy.
There is no service at all and the question of imposition of service tax on
such transaction is illegal and beyond the legislative competence of the
Central Government.
14\. An alternate submission was made that even if there is an element of
service, the dominant intention of the parties/transaction is to be looked
into and if the same is done, it is transfer of goods and such transaction
cannot be construed as service. In any event, there is no power vested with
the Parliament to dissect the transaction unlike works contract, catering
service or hire purchase transactions, which have been enumerated in Clause
(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution.
15\. Mr.V.Sundareswaran, learned Central Government Standing Counsel for
Respondents submitted that Clause (29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution was
inserted to give extended meaning to the definition of sale and that
Parliament has not divested its power to levy service tax. It was submitted
that service tax imposed by the Union under Entry 97 of List I was upheld by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Learned counsel submitted that various transactions
between the producer and the distributor and the distributor and sub-
distributor or exhibitor (theatre owner) is the value addition to the movie
and service tax imposed on those activities is only levy on the value
addition. The learned counsel submitted that temporary transfer of copyright
or permission to use or enjoyment are not covered by Entry 54 of List II or
Entry 92A of List I. Placing reliance upon in the cases of Tamil Nadu Kalyana
Mandapam Association case (2004) 5 SCC 632; Association of Leasing and
Financial Services Companies case (2011) 2 SCC 352; All India Federation of
Tax Practitioners case (2007) 7 SCC 527 and Gujarat Ambuja Cements Limited
case (2006) 3 SCC 1, the learned counsel submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court upheld the levy of service tax under Entry 97 of List I. It was
submitted that the impugned levy of service tax on temporary transfer of
copyright or permission to use or enjoyment is within the legislative
competence of Parliament with reference to Entry 97 of List I of Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution of India and the same is constitutionally valid.
16\. We have also heard the submissions of Mr.Kanmani Annamalai, learned
Government Advocate (T) appearing for State of Tamil Nadu and Mr.R.Ananda
Kumar, learned counsel appearing for 4th Respondent in W.P.No.482 of 2011 and
5th Respondent in W.P.No.483 of 2011 and 231 of 2012.
17\. Upon consideration of the rival contentions and averments in the Writ
Petitions and counter statement, the following points arise for consideration
in these Writ Petitions:-
1.Whether the taxable event provided under Section 65(105)(zzzzt) of the
Finance Act, 1994 is covered by Article 366 (29A)(d), which is a "deemed sale
of goods"?
2.Whether the Petitioners are right in contending that the levy of service tax
on "temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of copyright"
provided under Section 65(105)(zzzzt) of the Finance Act, 1994 is covered
under Entry 54 of List II and whether it amounts to transgression by
Parliament into the exclusive domain of the State Legislature?
3.Whether the Petitioners are right in contending that the copyright is goods
and transfer of copyright of Cinematograph films is only delivery of goods for
consideration and is absolute transfer and no service element is involved?
4.Even assuming that there is an element of service involved in the nature of
transaction done by the Petitioners, should the dominant intention of the
transaction being transfer of goods has to be only taken into consideration?
5.Whether the Petitioners are right in contending that Parliament has no
authority to dissect a composite transaction as in the case of the Petitioners
and levy service tax?
6.Whether Section 65(105)(zzzzt) levying service tax on the temporary transfer
or permitting the use or enjoyment of copyright is ultra vires the
Constitution?
18\. Service Tax - an Introduction:-
Before, we proceed further on the submissions made on either side, it would be
essential to first have an overall view of the concept of Service Tax.
19\. Service Tax is an indirect tax levied on certain services provided by
certain categories of persons including companies, associations, firms, body
of individuals etc. Services constitute heterogeneous spectrum of economic
activities, covers wide range of activities, such as management, banking,
insurance, hospitality, consultancy, communication, administration,
entertainment, research and developmental activities forming part of retailing
sector. Economics hold the view that there is no distinction between the
consumption of goods and consumption of services as both satisfy the human
needs. (See ALL INDIA FEDERATION OF TAX PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS v. UNION OF
INDIA AND OTHERS, (2007) 7 SCC 527 = [(2007) 9 VST 126 (SC)].
20\. During 1994-95, a new concept of Service Tax was introduced by imposing
tax on services of Telephones, General Insurance and Stock Broking and the
list has increased since then. Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 defines
"assessee" to mean the person responsible for collecting the service tax. The
Service Tax was defined to mean tax chargeable under Chapter V. Taxable
Service was defined to mean any service provided by stock brokers to an
investor in connection with sale or purchase of securities listed by a
recognised stock exchange; services rendered by the subscriber of the
telegraph authority and services rendered by insurer to a policy holder.
Section 66 stated that Service Tax shall be levied at the rate of 5% of the
value of the taxable services provided to any person by service provider who
was responsible for collecting the service tax.
21\. Finance Act, 1998, was also to the same effect as that of the 1994 Act
and in the 1998 Act, the list of notified services were increased to include
advertising agencies, travel agencies, architects, entrepreneurs, clearing and
forwarding agencies, credit rating agencies, customs house agents, practising
charted accountants, cost accountants, real estate agents, security agencies
etc. The Finance Act has been amended year after year in order to bring more
services into the tax net, as well as to insert certain new provision found
necessary.
22\. The legislative competence of the Parliament to levy service tax on
Kalyana Mandapam on use of goods transport services, chartered Accountants and
leasing and financial services, under Entry 97 of List I under various
amendments have been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various decisions
(Vide Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Association Vs. Union of India and others,
(2004) 5 SCC 632; Association of Leasing and Financial Services companies vs.
Union of India and others, (2011) 2 SCC 352, All India Federation of Tax
Practitioners and another Vs. Union of India and others, (2007) 7 SCC 527,
Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. And another Vs. Union of India, (2005) 4 SCC 214
and BSNL Vs. Union of India, (2006) 3 SCC 1).
23\. Relevant Provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957:-
Licensing or exploitation of other intellectual rights like trademarks,
designs, patterns or any other similar intangible properties are within the
ambit of service tax since 2004. However, Copyright was excluded till
1.7.2010. With effect from 1.7.2010, sub-clause (zzzzt) of clause (105) of
Section 65 defines "taxable service" as under:
"Taxable service" means any service provided or to be provided to any person,
by any other person, for -
(a) transferring temporarily; or
(b) permitting the use or enjoyment of, any copyright defined in the Copyright
Act, 1957, except the rights covered under sub-clause (a) of clause (l) of
Section 13 of the said act."
Thus, the first category of copyright i.e., original literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works are out of the service tax.
24\. Levy of service tax on the temporary transfer or permitting the use or
enjoyment of the copyrights and the vires of sub-clause (zzzzt) of Section
65(105) is the contentious issue in these writ petitions. Now we have to
examine as to whether the petitioners are right in contending that the service
tax sought to be levied is a tax on deemed sale of goods leviable under Entry
54 of List I and the Parliament lacks power to levy service tax invoking the
residuary Entry 97 of List I.
25\. For proper appreciation of the arguments advanced, it is necessary to
refer to the meaning of "copyright" with reference to Cinematograph films and
also the definition of the relevant provisions in Copyright Act. Section 2(f)
defines "Cinematograph Film" as under:
2(f) cinematograph film" means any work of visual recording on any medium
produced through a process from which a moving image may be produced by any
means and includes a sound recording accompanying such visual recording and
"cinematograph" shall be construed as including any work produced by any
process analogous to cinematography including video films. Section 2(ff)
deals with communication to the public, which reads as under:
2(ff) communication to the public" means making any work available for being
seen or heard or otherwise enjoyed by the public direct ly or by any means of
display or diffusion other than by issuing copies of such work regardless of
whether any member of the public actually sees, hears or otherwise enjoys the
work so made available.
Explanation. - For the purposes of this clause, communication through
satellite or cable or any other means of simultaneous communication to more
than one household or place of residence including residential rooms of any
hotel or hostel shall be deemed to be communication to the public.
26\. As per Section 2(uu), producer means producer in relation to a
cinematograph film or sound recording, means a person who takes the initiative
and responsibility for making the work.
27\. As per Section 13, Copyright subsists in the following works:
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of
this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout India in the following classes of
works, that is to say,-
(a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works;
(b) cinematograph films; and
(c) sound recordings. In relation to the Cinematograph film, "copyright"
means "Section 14. Meaning of copyright:- -For the purposes of this Act,
"copyright" means the exclusive right subject to the provisions of this Act,
to do or authorise the doing of any of the following acts in respect of a work
or any substantial part thereof, namely:-
(a) ....
(b) ....
(c) .....
(d) in the case of a cinematograph film, -
(i) to make a copy of the film including a photograph of any image forming
part thereof;
(ii) to sell or give on hire or offer for sale or hire, any copy of the film,
regardless of whether such copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier
occasions;
(iii) to communicate the film to the public.
28\. Section 18 defines Assignment. Section 18 deals with Assignment of
copyright i.e., the owner of copyright in an existing work or the prospective
owner of the copyright in the future work may assign to any person the
copyright either wholly or partially and either generally or subject to
limitations and either for the whole of the copyright or any part thereof.
Section 19 deals with Mode of Assignment. Section 30 deals with Licences by
owners of copyright. Section 26 deals with Term of copyright in
Cinematograph films, as per which copyright shall subsist until sixty years
from the beginning of the calendar year next following the year in which the
film is published.
29\. Point No.1:-
Re.contention : That the taxable event under sub-clause (zzzzt) of Section 65
(105) is covered by Article 366 (29A) sub-clause (d):- Contention of
petitioners is that Copyright is considered as transfer of right to use the
goods, which is a sale in terms of Article 366(29A) read with Entry 54 and
not a service. Mr.Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner has invited our
attention to the brief history of levy of tax on films and historical
background of the Constitution 46th Amendment Act, 1982 inserting Clause (29A)
to Article 366 of the Constitution to impose tax on the transfer of right to
use any goods, thereby to avoid tax evasion by devices by way of lease
adopted by the Producer and the Distributor.
30\. Mr.K.Vaitheeswaran, learned counsel for the petitioners drawing our
attention to the decision of this Court in A.V.Meyyppan Vs. Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes, Board of Revenue, Madras and another, (20 STC 115) submitted
that the temporary transfer of copyright is considered as a transfer of right
to use goods, which is a deemed sale in terms of Article 366(29A). Learned
counsel further submitted that the copyrights in the Cinematograph films have
been considered as goods as the items are subject to sales tax (VAT) by the
State Legislature in terms of Entry 54 of List II and while so, Parliament
cannot resort to Entry 97 of List I to levy service tax on the temporary
transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of the copyright.
31\. Brief history of taxation of films under Sales Tax Laws:-
In relation to taxation of films under Service Tax Act, there can be normal
sale of film or sale by way of lease. In A.V.Meyyppan Vs. Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes, Board of Revenue, Madras and another, (20 STC 115), the
assessee, a producer of Cinematograph films, obtained the copyright of a story
in "Hindi" and on the basis of that story produced a cinematography film. The
assessee then entered into an agreement with a Limited Company/the lessee,
under which the assessee made over to the lessee the outright lease of the
world negative rights of the film for a period of 49 years and for a
consideration amounting to the declared cost of production of the film plus
15% thereon as profit to the assessee , subject to a minimum price of
Rs.10,00,000/- payable by the lessee to the assessee. The Sales Tax
Authorities held that though the transaction was described as a lease for 49
years, the assessee had effected a sale of the negative print of the picture
for a consideration and therefore the transaction was liable to sales tax
under the Madras General Sales Tax Act. Applying the criteria laid down by the
Supreme Court in State of Madras Vs. Gannon Dunkerley & Co., (Madras) Limited,
1959 SCR 379 = (1958) 9 STC 353, the Madras High Court held that even if
copyright is regarded as a species of movable property, the transaction did
not connote a sale at all and it was therefore not liable to sales tax. The
Madras High Court held that the film was given to the lessee for exhibition
for 49 years and there was no transfer of ownership in film to exhibitor.
Therefore, the Madras High Court held that it is a leasing of film, but not
sale, since there is no permanent transfer of ownership in the copyright in
the film to the purchaser.
32\. To overcome the above judgment as well as other judgments, where sale was
held to have restricted meaning, the Constitution of India was amended in 1982
by the Constitution (46th Amendment) Act, 1982. From the statement of objects
and reasons, we find that the concept of "deemed sale" is brought in by the
Constitution (46th Amendment Act) in the context of imposition of sales tax
and that the words "transfer, delivery or supply of goods" are referred to in
the second limb of Clause (29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution to broaden
the tax base. Clause (29A) of Article 366 reads as under:
(29A) tax on the sale or purchase of goods includes
(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contact, of
property in any goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration;
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some
other form) invoked in the execution of a works contract;
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire purchase or any system of payment
by instalments;
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose
(whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other
valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of
persons to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other
manner whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human
consumption or any drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or
service, is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and
such transfer, delivery or supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of
those goods by the person making the transfer, delivery or supply and a
purchase of those goods by the person to whom such transfer, delivery or
supply is made;
33\. Contention of petitioners is that the transactions between the producer
and the distributor and the distributor and the exhibitor involve delivery of
tangible property as goods and in any event those transactions are covered
within the extended meaning of sub-clause (d) of clause (29A) of Article 366 
on the transfer of the right to use the goods". When the transaction could be
brought within the extended meaning of Article 366(29A), Parliament cannot
levy service tax by resorting to Entry 97 of List I.
34\. On behalf of the petitioners, it was submitted that the deemed sale in
various clauses of Article 366(29A) are incorporated in Section 2(33) of Tamil
Nadu Value Added Tax Act and VAT Act of various States. It was further
submitted that insofar as inter-State sales are concerned, Section 2(g) of
Central Sales Tax Act has been amended by Finance Act,2002 inserting various
clauses of deemed sale in terms of Article 366(29A). Contention of
petitioners is that the temporary transfer of copyright or its use or
enjoyment amounts to transfer of the right to use the goods. According to
the petitioners, as per the Constitution, Sales tax on goods in the course of
intra-State sales is the subject matter of the States in terms of Entry 54 of
List II and Sales tax on goods in the course of inter-State sale is the
subject matter of Union in terms of Entry 92A of List I and when the
temporary transfer of copyright is treated as sale of goods and having
levied sales tax, Parliament cannot again call it as a service for levying
service tax and the Union of India has no competence to levy or collect sales
tax on the transaction.
35\. Article 366(29A) no doubt served to extend the meaning of the word
"sale". The taxable event under Article 366(29A) is the transfer of right to
use the goods regardless of whether the goods are delivered for use. Levy of
tax is not on use of goods, but on the transfer of the right to use the goods.
Article 366(29A) of the Constitution permits tax on sale of goods and within
its ambit, transfer of right to use the goods. While completing transfer or
right to use any goods (where the original owner relinquishes his copyright)
may be considered as sale of goods, temporary transfer of right or a mere
transfer of right to use or enjoy copyright for specified purpose(s), is
certainly a service provided by the person, who is the holder of copyright.
As held by the Supreme Court in B.S.N.L. Case [(2006) 3 SCC 1], it is a nature
of transaction that will determine the taxability in each case.
36\. In 20th Century Finance Corporation Limited Vs. State of Maharashtra,
(2000) 6 SCC 12 = (2000) 119 STC 182 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down
the principles for determining the situs of lease sale transaction. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the situs of lease sale lies in the State
where the agreement is executed if the goods are available for delivery. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court further held that if the goods are not available for
delivery or there is no written agreement, then the sale will be deemed to
have taken place in the State where the delivery is given. While so holding,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court elaborated upon the scope of Article 366 Clause 29A
and observing that the taxable event under Article 366(29A) is the transfer of
right to use the goods and elaborately considering the scope of Article
366(29A), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
"26. Next question that arises for consideration is, where is the taxable
event on the transfer of the right to use any goods. Article 366(29-A)(d)
empowers the State Legislature to enact law imposing sales tax on the transfer
of the right to use goods. The various sub-clauses of clause (29-A) of Article
366 permit the imposition of tax thus: sub-clause (a) on transfer of property
in goods; sub-clause (b) on transfer of property in goods; sub-clause (c) on
delivery of goods; sub-clause (d) on transfer of the right to use goods; sub-
clause (e) on supply of goods; and sub-clause (f) on supply of services. The
words and such transfer, delivery or supply ... in the latter portion of
clause (29-A), therefore, refer to the words transfer, delivery and supply, as
applicable, used in the various sub-clauses. ...........
In our view, therefore, on a plain construction of sub-clause (d) of clause
(29-A), the taxable event is the transfer of the right to use the goods
regardless of when or whether the goods are delivered for use. What is
required is that the goods should be in existence so that they may be used.
..........
27\. Article 366(29-A)(d) further shows that levy of tax is not on use of
goods but on the transfer of the right to use goods. The right to use goods
accrues only on account of the transfer of right. In other words, right to use
arises only on the transfer of such a right and unless there is transfer of
right, the right to use does not arise. Therefore, it is the transfer which is
sine qua non for the right to use any goods. If the goods are available, the
transfer of the right to use takes place when the contract in respect thereof
is executed. As soon as the contract is executed, the right is vested in the
lessee. Thus, the situs of taxable event of such a tax would be the transfer
which legally transfers the right to use goods. In other words, if the goods
are available irrespective of the fact where the goods are located and a
written contract is entered into between the parties, the taxable event on
such a deemed sale would be the execution of the contract for the transfer of
right to use goods. But in case of an oral or implied transfer of the right to
use goods it may be effected by the delivery of the goods.
37\. Section 65(105)(zzzzt) seeks to tax viz., "temporary transfer or
permitting the use or enjoyment" of copyright which is a service provided by
the producer/distributor/exhibitor. Service Tax is a levy not on the "transfer
of right to use the goods" as described under Article 366(29A) sub-clause (d);
but on the temporary transfer" or "permitting the use or enjoyment" of the
copyright as defined under the Copyright Act, 1957. In the case of Sales Tax
Act, there would be "transfer of right to use the goods". Whereas under the
Service Tax Act what is levied is temporary transfer/enjoyment of the goods.
The pith and substance of both enactments are totally different. "Temporary
transfer" or "permitting the use or enjoyment of the copyright" is not within
the State's exclusive power under Entry 54 of List II. Therefore, there is no
merit in the contention that the taxable event provided under Section
65(105)(zzzzt) is covered by Article 366(29A).
38\. Point No.2:- Re.contention : Temporary transfer or use or enjoyment of
the copyright is a sale of goods falling under Entry 54 of List II:-
On behalf of the petitioners, learned counsel submitted that the agreements
entered into between the producer and the distributor and the distributor and
exhibitors (theatres) is patterned on different lines based on commercial
exigency and the arrangement involves delivery of goods. Drawing our attention
to various patterns of agreements in film industry, the learned counsel
contended that such agreements involve delivery of goods for which sales tax
is levied. On behalf of the petitioners, it was contended that in the course
of inter-State sale, under Entry 92A of List I, Union of India levies sales
tax and the sale in the course of intra-State is the subject matter of the
States falling under Entry 54 of List II and in the case of intra-State sale,
State Government has the exclusive power to levy tax and Union is not
permitted to levy and/or collect service tax on the transaction that is
subjected to VAT. It was submitted that exercising powers in terms of Entry 54
of List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, State enacted Tamil Nadu
Value Added Tax Act, 2006. It was further submitted that as per section 2(33)
of Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act and section 3 of the Act read with Sl.No.70
of Part B of the First Schedule to the Act, the State Government levies value
added tax on the sale or transfer of right to use the copyright and while so,
parliament cannot levy service tax on the same, which is subject to VAT.
39\. List I of the Seventh Schedule enumerates the subjects to which Union may
inter alia legislate for tax levy. Entry 92A List I reads as under:
Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, where such sale
or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
Residuary Entry - Entry 97 of List I reads as under:
Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not
mentioned in either of those Lists. Entry 54 of List II to the Seventh
Schedule reads as under:
Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, subject to the
provisions of entry 92A of List I By legislating under Entry 54 of List II,
various States have enacted legislation in terms of VAT/Sales Tax Act. States
have exercised their powers to levy a tax on the intra-State sale of goods in
terms of Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule and the Government of
Tamil Nadu has also enacted Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act.
40\. Goods is defined in Section 2(7) of Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and in
number of decisions, Supreme Court held that the goods used in Entry 54 of
List II has to be interpreted liberally. Contention of learned counsel
Mr.Prasad is that under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, when
the State Government levies VAT, Union of India cannot resort to residuary
powers of Legislation under Entry 97 of List I to legislate for the levy of
taxes on service and the residuary power to Entry 97 is available only if
such power is inter alia not reserved in favour of the States under any Entry
enumerated in List II.
41\. Reiterating the same submissions, Mr.Vaitheeswaran, learned counsel
submitted that Copyrights are classified as intangible property and are
accordingly treated as goods for levying VAT on the transfer of
copyrights. The learned counsel further submitted that many States like
Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and West Bengal have exercised
their powers to levy tax on sale of goods in terms of Entry 54 of List II to
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the Parliament cannot levy
service tax on the goods, which are already subjected to VAT.
42\. The learned Senior counsel Mr.M.Venkatachalapathi also submitted that the
transfer of copyright is only sale of intangible goods and that it is only
a temporary transfer of copyright and no service is provided and therefore
levy of the service tax and the amendment - 65(105)(zzzzt) having resort to
Entry 97 of List I are ultra vires the Constitution.
43\. In short, the submission of all the writ petitioners is that temporary
transfer of copyright or use or permit of a copyright in a cinematograph film
is only a transfer of right to use the goods, which is a sale/deemed sale
for which legislating under Entry 54 of List II, States have enacted
legislation in terms of VAT/Sales Tax Acts. It is their submission that in a
case of inter-State sales, in terms of Entry 92A of Union List, Sales Tax is
levied under Central Sales Tax Act and while so it is not open to the
Parliament to treat the transaction as service for levy of sales tax.
Further contention of petitioners is that Entry 97 mandates that Union of
India may legislate only in respect of any other matter not enumerated in
List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those Lists.
and having levied Sales Tax by treating it as goods, the Parliament cannot
call it as service for levy of service tax.
44\. For considering the submissions, we need to keep in mind the doctrine of
pith and substance and the rule of interpretation of legislative entries. We
need to point out that on four occasions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the
levy of service tax with reference to Entry 97 of List I in the light of
challenges to the competence of the Parliament. Having regard to the
contentions raised it is necessary to refer to the judgments of the Supreme
Court, upholding the levy of service tax and the principles laid thereon.
45\. In Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam case (2004) 5 SCC 632, in respect of tax
on catering services provided by Kalyan Mandap keeper, similar contentions
were raised contending (i) that it amounts to tax on land and therefore by
reason of Entry 49 of List II, only the State Government is competent to levy
such tax; (ii) it amounts to tax on sale and purchase of goods and therefore
is beyond the competence of Parliament, particularly in view of the definition
of tax on sale and purchase of goods contained in Article 366(29A)(f) of the
Constitution. Observing that in the matters of taxation laws, the Court
permits greater latitude to pick and choose objects for rates on taxation and
has a wide discretion with regard thereto and upholding the levy of tax on
catering services provided by Mandap keepers, in the case of Tamil Nadu
Kalyana Mandapam Association v. Union of India and others (2004) 5 SCC 632,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
51. Taxable services, therefore, could include the mere providing of premises
on a temporary basis for organising any official, social or business
functions, but would also include other facilities supplied in relation
thereto. No distinction from restaurants, hotels, etc. which provide limited
access to property for specific purpose.
52\. It may be noted that in recent times the service sector has grown
phenomenally all over the world and, therefore, it was recommended by Dr. Raja
Chelliah Committee in the early nineties that it should be taxed. Pursuant
thereto, service tax was first levied in 1994 by way of the Finance Act. The
power to levy such tax can be traced to Sl. No. 97 of List I of the Seventh
Schedule and this Court in Laghu Udyog Bharati v. Union of India (1999) 6 SCC
418 found no lack of legislative competence as far as the levy of service tax
was concerned.
53\. It is also emphasised that a tax cannot be struck down on the ground of
lack of legislative competence by enquiring whether the definition accords
with what the layman's view of service is. It is well settled that in matters
of taxation laws, the court permits greater latitude to pick and choose
objects and rates for taxation and has a wide discretion with regard thereto.
We may in this context refer to the decision of Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v.
Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 536(SCC para 343, at pp. 740-41):
In the matter of taxation laws, the court permits a great latitude to the
discretion of the legislature. The State is allowed to pick and choose
districts, objects, persons, methods and even rates for taxation, if it does
so reasonably. The courts view the laws relating to economic activities with
greater latitude than other matters.
54\. Therefore, a levy of service tax on a particular kind of service could
not be struck down on the ground that it does not conform to a common
understanding of the word service so long as it does not transgress any
specific restriction contained in the Constitution.
55\. In fact, making available a premises for a period of a few hours for the
specific purpose of being utilised as a mandap whether with or without other
services would itself be a service and cannot be classified as any other kind
of legal concept. It does not certainly involve transfer of movable property
nor does it involve transfer of movable property of any kind known to law
either under the Transfer of Property Act or otherwise and can only be
classified as a service.
56\. In fact, mandap-keepers provide a wide variety of services apart from the
service of allowing temporary occupation of mandap. As per Section 65(19) of
the Finance Act, 1994, mandap means any immovable property as defined in
Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and includes any furniture,
fixture, light fittings and floor coverings therein let out for consideration
for organising any official, social or business function. A mandap-keeper
apart from proper maintenance of the mandap, also provides the necessary
paraphernalia for holding such functions, apart from providing the conditions
and ambience which are required by the customer such as providing the lighting
arrangements, furniture and fixtures, floor coverings, etc. The services
provided by him cover method and manner of decorating and organising the
mandap. The mandap-keeper provides the customer with advice as to what should
be the quantum and quality of the services required keeping in view the
requirement of the customer, the nature of the event to be solemnised, etc. In
fact the logistics of setting up, selection and maintenance is the
responsibility of the mandap-keeper. The services of the mandap-keeper cannot
possibly be termed as a hire-purchase agreement of a right to use goods or
property. The services provided by a mandap-keeper are professional services
which he alone by virtue of his experience has the wherewithal to provide. A
customer goes to a mandap-keeper, say a star hotel, not merely for the food
that it will provide but for the entire variety of services provided therein
which result in providing the function to be solemnised with the required
effect and ambience. Similarly the services rendered by outdoor caterers is
clearly distinguishable from the service rendered in a restaurant or a hotel
inasmuch as, in the case of outdoor catering service the food/eatables/drinks
are the choice of the person who partakes of the services. He is free to
choose the kind, quantum and manner in which the food is to be served. But in
the case of a restaurant, the customer's choice of foods is limited to the
menu card. Again in the case of outdoor catering, customer is at liberty to
choose the time and place where the food is to be served. In the case of an
outdoor caterer, the customer negotiates each element of the catering service,
including the price to be paid to the caterer. Outdoor catering has an element
of personalised service provided to the customer. Clearly, the service element
is more weighty, visible and predominant in the case of outdoor catering. It
cannot be considered as a case of sale of food and drink as in a restaurant.
Though the service tax is leviable on the gross amount charged by the mandap-
keeper for services in relation to the use of a mandap and also on the charges
for catering, the Government has decided to charge the same only on 60% of the
gross amount charged by the mandap-keeper to the customer. .....
58\. A tax on services rendered by mandap-keepers and outdoor caterers is in
pith and substance, a tax on services and not a tax on sale of goods or on
hire-purchase activities. Section 65 clause (41) sub-clause (p) of the Finance
Act, 1994, defines taxable service (which is the subject-matter of levy of
service tax) as any service provided to a customer by a mandap-keeper in
relation to the use of a mandap in any manner including the facilities
provided to [a customer] in relation to such use and also the services, if
any, rendered as a caterer. The nature and character of this service tax is
evident from the fact that the transaction between a mandap-keeper and his
customer is definitely not in the nature of a sale or hire-purchase of goods.
It is essentially that of providing a service. In fact, as pointed out
earlier, the manner of service provided assumes predominance over the
providing of food in such situations which is a definite indicator of the
supremacy of the service aspect. The legislature in its wisdom noticed the
said supremacy and identified the same as a potential region to collect
indirect taxes. Moreover, it has been a well-established judicial principle
that so long as the legislation is in substance, on a matter assigned to a
legislature enacting that statute, it must be held valid in its entirety even
though it may trench upon matters beyond its competence. Incidental
encroachment does not invalidate such a statute on the grounds that it is
beyond the competence of the legislature (Prafulla Kumar v. Bank of Commerce,
AIR 1947 PC 60). Article 246(1) of the Constitution specifies that Parliament
has exclusive powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters
enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. As per
Article 246(3), the State Government has exclusive powers to make laws with
respect to matters enumerated in List II (State List). In respect of matters
enumerated in List III (Concurrent List) both Parliament and State Governments
have powers to make laws. The service tax is made by Parliament under the
above residuary powers.
46\. In GUJARAT AMBUJA CEMENT LTD v. UNION OF INDIA [(2005) 4 SCC 214], the
Writ Petitioners were customers or clients of Goods Transport Operators and
Forwarding and Clearing Agents. One among the contention was that the levy of
service tax on goods transport operators and forwarding and clearing agents,
encroaches upon the State Government's power as defined in Entry 56 of List II
of the seventh schedule to the Constitution and the Parliament could not by
resorting to residuary Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule circumvent
Entry 56 of List II and in the guise of levying service tax in fact levy a tax
on the transport of goods. Noting that there is distinction between the object
of tax, the incidence of tax and machinery for the collection of tax and
legislative competence is to be determined with reference to the object of the
levy and not with reference to its incidence or machinery, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held as under:-
27. There is a distinction between the object of tax, the incidence of tax
and the machinery for the collection of the tax. The distinction is important
but is apt to be confused. Legislative competence is to be determined with
reference to the object of the levy and not with reference to its incidence or
machinery. There is a further distinction between the objects of taxation in
our constitutional scheme. The object of tax may be an article or substance
such as a tax on land and buildings under Entry 49 of List II, or a tax on
animals and boats under Entry 58 List II or on a taxable event such as
manufacture of goods under Entry 84 of List I, import or export of goods under
Entry 83 of List I, entry of goods under Entry 52 of List II or sale of goods
under Entry 54 List II to name a few. Theoretically, of course, as we have
held in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. v. State of U.P, (2005) 2 SCC 515,
ultimately even a tax on goods will be on the taxable event of ownership or
possession. We need not go into this question except to emphasise that,
broadly speaking the subject-matter of taxation under Entry 56 of List II are
goods and passengers. The phrase carried by roads or natural waterways
carves out the kind of goods or passengers which or who can be subjected to
tax under the entry. The ambit and purport of the entry has been dealt with in
Rai Ramkrishna v. State of Bihar ((1964) 1 SCR 897 = AIR 1963 SC 1667), where
it was said in language which we cannot better: (SCR p. 908) Entry 56 of the
Second List refers to taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or on
inland waterways. It is clear that the State Legislatures are authorised to
levy taxes on goods and passengers by this entry. It is not on all goods and
passengers that taxes can be imposed under this entry; it is on goods and
passengers carried by road or on inland waterways that taxes can be imposed.
The expression carried by road or on inland waterways is an adjectival
clause qualifying goods and passengers, that is to say, it is goods and
passengers of the said description that have to be taxed under this entry.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that the goods as such cannot pay taxes, and so
taxes levied on goods have to be recovered from some persons, and these
persons must have an intimate or direct connection or nexus with the goods
before they can be called upon to pay the taxes in respect of the carried
goods. Similarly, passengers who are carried are taxed under the entry. But,
usually, it would be inexpedient, if not impossible, to recover the tax
directly from the passengers and so, it would be expedient and convenient to
provide for the recovery of the said tax from the owners of the vehicles
themselves. (See also Sainik Motors v. State of Rajasthan, ((1962) 1 SCR 517
= AIR 1961 SC 1480.)
28\. Having determined the parameters of the two legislative entries the
principles for determining the constitutionality of a statute come into play.
These principles may briefly be summarised thus:
(a) The substance of the impugned Act must be looked at to determine whether
it is in pith and substance within a particular entry whatever its ancillary
effect may be [Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee v. Bank of Commerce Ltd.,AIR 1947 PC
60, 65, A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras, 1957 SCR 399 = 1957 CriLJ 409, State
of Rajasthan v. G. Chawla, 1959 Supp. (1) SCR 904 = 1959 CriLJ 660, Katra
Educational Society v. State of U.P, (1966) 3 SCR 328 = AIR 1966 SC 1307, D.C.
Johar & Sons (P) Ltd. v. STO, 1971 (27) STC 120 (SC) and Kannan Devan Hills
Produce v. State of Kerala, (1972) 2 SCC 218).
(b) Where the encroachment is ostensibly ancillary but in truth beyond the
competence of the enacting authority, the statute will be a colourable piece
of legislation and constitutionally invalid (A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras,
(1957 SCR 399 = 1957 CriLJ 409, A.B. Abdul Kadir v. State of Kerala, (1976) 3
SCC 219 at p. 232 = 1976 SCC (Tax) 270 and Federation of Hotel & Restaurant
Assn. of India v. Union of India, ((1989) 3 SCC 634 at p.651). If the statute
is legislatively competent the enquiry into the motive which persuaded
Parliament or the State Legislature into passing the Act is irrelevant (Dharam
Dutt v. Union of India, ((2004) 1 SCC 712 = (2003) 10 Scale 141).
(c) Apart from passing the test of legislative competency, the Act must be
otherwise legally valid and would also have to pass the test of
constitutionality in the sense that it cannot be in violation of the
provisions of the Constitution nor can it operate extraterritorially. (See
Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras, (1953) SCR 677).
29\. The provisions relating to service tax in the Finance Act, 1994 make it
clear under Section 64(3) that the Act applies only to taxable services.
Taxable services have been defined, as we have already noted, in Section
65(41). Each of the sub-clauses of that clause refers to the different kinds
of services provided. Most of the taxable services cannot be said to be in any
way related to goods or passengers carried by road or waterways. For example,
Section 65(41)(g) provides for service rendered to a client by a consulting
engineer, Section 65(41)(k) refers to service to a client by a manpower
recruitment agency, Section 65(41)(o) refers to service by pandal or shamiana
contractors and so on. The rate of service tax has been fixed under Section
66. Section 67 provides for valuation of taxable service for the purposes of
charging tax. The provision for valuation of service rendered by clearing and
forwarding agents has been dealt with under clause (j) and service provided by
goods transport operators has been provided under clause (l) [subsequently
renumbered as clause (m-a)]. These clauses read respectively as under:
67. (j) in relation to service provided by a clearing and forwarding agent to
a client, shall be the gross amount charged by such agent from the client for
services of clearing and forwarding operations in any manner; 67. (m-a) in
relation to service provided by a goods transport operator to a customer,
shall be the gross amount charged by such operator for services in relation to
carrying goods by road in a goods carriage and includes the freight charges
but does not include any insurance charges;
30\. As far as clause (j) is concerned it does not speak of goods or
passengers, nor of carriage of goods nor is it limited to service by road or
inland waterways. Clause (m-a) shows that the valuation of the service tax
includes the freight charges, but is not limited to it.
31\. It is clear therefore that Section 66 read with Sections 65(41)(j) and
67(m-a) in Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 do not seek to levy tax on goods
or passengers. The subject-matter of tax under those provisions of the Finance
Act, 1994 is not goods and passengers, but the service of transportation
itself. It is a levy distinct from the levy envisaged under Entry 56. It may
be that both the levies are to be measured on the same basis, but that does
not make the levy the same. As was held in Federation of Hotel and Restaurant
Assn. of India v. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 634 : (SCC pp. 652-53, paras
30-31)   subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the
power of a particular legislature may in another aspect and for another
purpose fall within another legislative power.  Indeed, the law with
respect to a subject might incidentally affect another subject in some way;
but that is not the same thing as the law being on the latter subject. There
might be overlapping; but the overlapping must be in law. The same transaction
may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects. But the fact
that there is an overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the
aspects.
32\. Since service tax is not a levy on passengers and goods but on the event
of service in connection with the carriage of goods, it is not therefore
possible to hold that the Act in pith and substance is within the States'
exclusive power under Entry 56 of List II. What the Act ostensibly seeks to
tax is what it, in substance, taxes. In the circumstances, the Act could not
be termed to be a colourable piece of legislation. It is not the case of the
petitioners that the Act is referable to any other entry apart from Entry 56
of List II. Therefore the negation of the petitioners' submission perforce
leads to the conclusion that the Act falls within the residuary power of
Parliament under Entry 97 of List I.
33\. Incidentally a similar challenge to the legislative competence of
Parliament to levy service tax was negatived in T.N. Kalyana Mandapam Assn. v.
Union of India, ((2004) 5 SCC 632 = (2004) 167 ELT 3) which was a case where
the levy of service tax was challenged by the owners of kalyana
mandapams/mandap-keepers. By virtue of the 1997 amendment service provided to
a client by mandap-keepers including the services if any rendered as a caterer
was treated as a taxable service. The challenge, inter alia, was that service
tax on mandap-keepers was colourable legislation as the said tax was not on
service but was in pith and substance only a tax on the sale of goods and/or a
tax on land. The writ petition filed before the Madras High Court was rejected
and the constitutionality of the levy was upheld. It was then urged before
this Court by the appellants that Entries 18, 14 and 54 of List II covered the
levy in question and, therefore, resort could not be had to Entry 97 in List I
of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. It was held by this Court that
although certain items of the service might have been referable to any other
entry, the service element was the more weighty, visible and predominant.
Therefore, the nature and character of the levy of the service tax was
distinct from a tax on the sale or hire-purchase of goods and from a tax on
land.
47\. In ALL INDIA FEDERATION OF TAX PRACTITIONERS v. UNION OF INDIA, (2007) 7
SCC 527, the appeal was against the Division Bench Judgment of the Bombay High
Court upholding the legislative competence of Parliament to impose Service Tax
under Article 246 (1) read with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to
the Constitution on practising Charted Accountants and Architects. On behalf
of the Appellant Association therein it was contended that tax on profession
was a State subject, and therefore, Entry 97 of List-I, cannot be invoked and
that Parliament had no legislative competence to levy Service Tax. After
analysing the object of enacting the Finance Act and interpreting the Taxing
entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, it was held as follows:
33. Applying the above tests laid down in the aforestated judgments to the
facts of the present case, we find that Entry 60 of List II, mentions 'Taxes
on professions, trades, callings and employments'. Entry 60 is a taxing entry.
It is not a general entry. Therefore, we hold that tax on professions etc. has
to be read as a levy on professions, trades, callings etc., as such.
Therefore, Entry 60 which refers to professions cannot be extended to include
services. This is what is called as an Aspect Theory. If the argument of the
appellants is accepted, then there would be no difference between
interpretation of a general entry and interpretation of a taxing entry in List
I and List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Therefore,
'professions' will not include services under Entry 60. For the above reasons,
we hold that Parliament had absolute jurisdiction and legislative competence
to levy tax on services. While interpreting the legislative heads under List
II, we have to go by schematic interpretation of the three Lists in the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and not by dictionary meaning of the
words 'profession' or 'professional' as was sought to be argued on behalf of
the appellants otherwise the distinction between general entries and taxing
entries under the three Lists would stand obliterated. The words 'in relation
to' and the words 'with respect to' are no doubt words of wide amplitude but
one has to keep in mind the context in which they are used.
44\. ....... A legislation like Finance Act can be supported on the basis of a
number of Entries. In the present case, we are concerned with the
Constitutional status of the levy, namely, service tax. The nomenclature of a
levy is not conclusive for deciding its true character and nature. For
deciding the true character and nature of a particular levy, with reference to
the legislative competence, the court has to look into the pith and substance
of the legislation. The powers of Parliament and State Legislatures are
subject to Constitutional limitations. Tax laws are governed by Part XII and
Part XIII. Article 265 takes in Article 245 when it says that the tax shall be
levied by the authority of law. To repeat, various entries in the Seventh
Schedule show that the power to levy tax is treated as a distinct matter for
the purpose of legislative competence. This is the underlying principle to
differentiate between the two Groups of entries, namely, general entries and
taxing entries. We are of the view that taxes on services is a different
subject as compared to taxes on professions, trades, callings etc. Therefore,
Entry 60 of List II and Entry 92C/97 of List I operate in different spheres.
48\. In ASSOCATION OF LEASING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES VS UNION OF
INDIA AND OTHERS (2011) 2 SCC 352, the controversy pertained to the validity
of section 65 (12) and 65 (105) (zm) of the Finance Act 1994 as amended in so
far as it seeks to levy service tax on leasing and hire purchase transactions.
It was contended that it was beyond the legislative competence of the
Parliament by virtue of Article 366 (29A) of the Constitution. In fact,
identical contentions as raised in these Writ Petitions were raised before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, contending that hire purchase/leasing is deemed to be a
sale and any attempt to levy service tax on the same transaction will amount
to colourable exercise of power and when sales tax is paid for transfer of
right to use the goods, particularly, when such transfer is a deemed sale
under Article 366 (29A), it is not open to the Parliament to impose service
tax on the sale transaction once again. Further it was contended that there is
no rendition of service in a hire purchase/ leasing transaction. The Hon'ble
the Supreme Court while analysing the scope of Article 366 (29A), held as
follows:
"Scope of Article 366(29-A)
49\. If one examines Article 366(29-A) carefully, one finds that Clause (29A)
provides for an inclusive definition and has two limbs. The first limb says
that the tax on sale or purchase of goods includes a tax on transactions
specified in Sub-clauses (a) to (f). The second limb provides that such
transfer, delivery or supply of goods referred to in the first limb shall be
deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making the transfer, delivery
or supply and purchase of those goods by the person to whom such transfer,
delivery or supply is made. Now, in K.L. Johar's case, (AIR 1965 SC 1082 =
(1965) 2 SCR 112) this Court held that the States can tax hire-purchase
transactions resulting in sale but only to the extent to which tax is levied
on the sale price. This led Parliament to say, in the Statement of Objects and
Reasons to the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, "though practically
the purchaser in a hire-purchase transaction gets the goods on the date of
entering into the hire-purchase contract, it has been held by the Supreme
Court in K.L. Johar's case (AIR 1965 SC 1082 = (1965) 2 SCR 112) that there is
a sale only when the purchaser exercises the option to purchase which is at a
later date and therefore only the depreciated value of the goods involved in
such transaction at the time the option is exercised becomes assessable to
sales tax which position has resulted in avoidance of tax in various ways."
Thus, we find from the Statement of Objects and Reasons that the concept of
"deemed sale" is brought in by the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act,
only in the context of imposition of sales tax and that the words "transfer,
delivery or supply" of goods is referred to in the second limb of Article
366(29-A) to broaden the tax base and that as indicated in the Report of Law
Commission prior to the judgment of this Court in Gannon Dunkerley's case,
(AIR 1958 SC 560 = 1959 SCR 379) works contract was always taxed by the States
as part of the word "sale" in Entry 48/54 of List II.
50\. The object behind enactment of Article 366(29-A) is to tax the composite
price so that the full value of the hire-purchase price is taxed and to avoid
the judgment in K.L. Johar's case whose implication was to narrow the tax base
resulting in seepage of sales tax revenue. It is in that sense "splitting" of
the contract needs to be understood. Thus, it cannot be said that Parliament
divested itself of the power to levy service tax vide enactment of the
Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act. Even in the Report of the Law
Commission, it has been observed that "if a hire-purchase transaction results
in a sale, sales-tax is undoubtedly leviable by the States. No doubt, it is
difficult to determine the "sale price" for the purpose of the sales tax law
but this has no bearing on the question of legislative competence" (p.26).
51\. Thus, reliance placed by the appellant(s) on the expression "splitting
up" in K.L. Johar's case is misconceived because the "splitting up" referred
to in K.L. Johar's case was, as stated above, in regard to valuation and not
in regard to legislative competence."
49\. On the question whether State legislature has exclusive competence to
levy tax on financial leasing services, under Entry 54 List II, it was held as
follows:
52. On behalf of the appellant(s) it was submitted that the State Legislature
has the exclusive competence to levy a tax on hire-purchase and financial
leasing by reason of Entry 54, List II read with Article 366(29A). It was
submitted that, as held by this Court in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam
Limited (supra) [vide para 44], splitting was permissible under Article
366(29A) only in two cases indicated in Sub-clauses (b) and (f) and that in no
other service (including hire-purchase).
53\. For answering the above, we need to keep in mind the doctrine of "pith
and substance" and the rule of interpretation of legislative entries. These
have to be applied to what is stated hereinabove in the earlier part of our
judgment in which we have dealt with the concept of "banking and other
financial services" and the nature and character of "service tax" as a tax on
activities. We may reiterate that Equipment Leasing and Hire-Purchase Finance
are activities of long term financing and they fall within the ambit of
"banking and other financial services". As stated above, a financial lease is
a lease that transfers substantially all risks and rewards incident to
ownership. In the said lease, the lessor (NBFC) merely finances the
equipment/asset which the lessee is free to select, order, take delivery and
maintain. The lessor (NBFC) arranges the funding. It accepts the invoice from
the vendor (supplier) and pays him. The income which the lessor earns is by
way of finance/interest charges in addition to the management fees or
documentation charges, etc. It is this income which constitutes the measure of
tax for the purposes of calculating the value of taxable services under
Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994. Thus, a financial lease would come within
"financial leasing services" in terms of Section 65(12)(a)(i).
54\. There are different types of financial leases, namely, a tax-based
financial lease, a leverage lease and an operating lease. In the present case,
there is no adjudication of the matter. The appellant(s) approached the High
Court directly without proper adjudication by the competent authority under
the Finance Act, 1994. Even in the matter of allocation between the principal
and finance/interest charges, adjudication under the Act was warranted which
has not been done. One must also bear in mind that Article 366(29A) is
essentially sales tax specific. It was brought in to expand the tax base which
stood narrowed down because of certain judgments of this Court. That is the
reason for bringing in the concept of "deemed sale" under which tax could be
imposed on mere "delivery" on hire-purchase [See Clause (c)] which expression
is also there in the second limb of the said article."
50\. As regards the power of the Parliament under Entry 97 List I, it was held
as follows:
58. Now coming to the main point whether the whole field is covered by Entry
54 and that the levy of service tax is incompetent, it is important to note
the language of Entry 97, List I and Article 248 except for the word "other"
in Entry 97. This is because when one reads Entry 97 of List I with Article
246(1) it confers exclusive power first, to make laws in respect of matters
specified in Entries 1 to 96 in List I and, secondly, it confers the residuary
power of making laws by Entry 97. Article 248 does not provide for any express
powers of Parliament but only for its residuary power. Article 248 adds
nothing to the power conferred by Article 246(1) read with Entry 97, List I.
In the context of an exhaustive enumeration of subjects of legislation what
does the conferment of residuary power mean? Entry 97, List I which confers
residuary powers on Parliament provides "97. Any other matter not enumerated
in List II and List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those
lists".
The word "other" is important. It means "any subject of legislation other than
the subject mentioned in Entries 1-96". Lastly, we must keep in mind a clear
distinction between the subject and measure of tax. [See Goodricke Group Ltd.
v. State of West Bengal: (1995) Supp 1 SCC 707
59\. Applying the above decisions to the present case, on examination of the
impugned legislation in its entirety, we are of the view that the impugned
levy relates to or is with respect to the particular topic of "banking and
other financial services" which includes within it one of the several
enumerated services, viz., financial leasing services. These include long time
financing by banks and other financial institutions (including NBFCs). These
are services rendered to their customers which comes within the meaning of the
expression "taxable services" as defined in Section 65(105)(zm). The taxable
event under the impugned law is the rendition of service. The impugned tax is
not on material or sale. It is on activity/service rendered by the service
provider to its customer. Equipment Leasing/Hire-Purchase finance are long
term financing activities undertaken as their business by NBFCs. As far as the
taxable value in case of financial leasing including equipment leasing and
hire-purchase is concerned, the amount received as principal is not the
consideration for services rendered. Such amount is credited to the capital
account of the lessor/hire-purchase service provider. It is the
interest/finance charge which is treated as income or revenue and which is
credited to the revenue account. Such interest or finance charges together
with the lease management fee/processing fee/documentation charges are treated
as considerations for the services rendered and accordingly they constitute
the value of taxable services on which service tax is made payable.
60\. In fact, the Government has given exemption from payment of service tax
to financial leasing services including equipment leasing and hire-purchase on
that portion of taxable value comprising of 90% of the amount representing as
interest, i.e., the difference between the installment paid towards repayment
of the lease amount and the principal amount in such installments paid (See
Notification No. 4/2006 - Service Tax dated 1.3.2006). In other words, service
tax is leviable only on 10% of the interest portion. (See also Circular F. No.
B.11/1/2001-TRU dated 9.7.2001 in which it has been clarified that service
tax, in the case of financial leasing including equipment leasing and hire-
purchase, will be leviable only on the lease management fees/processing
fees/documentation charges recovered at the time of entering into the
agreement and on the finance/interest charges recovered in equated monthly
installments and not on the principal amount). Merely because for valuation
purposes inter alia "finance/interest charges" are taken into account and
merely because service tax is imposed on financial services with reference to
"hiring/interest" charges, the impugned tax does not cease to be service tax
and nor does it become tax on hire-purchase/leasing transactions under Article
366(29A) read with Entry 54, List II. Thus, while State Legislature is
competent to impose tax on "sale" by legislation relatable to Entry 54 of List
II of Seventh Schedule, tax on the aspect of the "services", vendor not being
relatable to any entry in the State List, would be within the legislative
competence of the Parliament under Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I of
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
...
66\. .... The service tax in the present case is neither on the material nor
on sale. It is on the activity of financing/funding of equipment/asset within
the meaning of the words "financial leasing services" in Section 65(12)(a)(i).
67\. Lastly, we may state that this Court has on three different occasions
upheld the levy of service with reference to Entry 97 of List I in the face of
challenges to the competence of the Parliament based on the entries in List II
and on all the three occasions, this Court has held that the levy of service
tax falls within Entry 97 of List I. The decisions are in the case of T.N.
Kalayana Mandapam Association, (2004) 5 SCC 632, Gujarat Ambuja Cements
Ltd.(2005) 4 SCC 214 and All-India Federation of Tax Practitioners, (2007) 7
SCC 527.
51\. On a careful analysis of the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
referred above, it is seen that the Hon'ble Supreme Court on four occasions,
upheld the levy of service tax with reference to Entry 97 of List I and in all
the four cases, which have been quoted above, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that the levy of service tax falls within Entry 97 of List I. Therefore, any
challenge on this aspect by the petitioners must necessarily fail.
52\. As per Section 14(d) of Copyright Act, in the case of Cinematograph film.
Copyright means the exclusive right, subject to the provisions of the Act:-
(i) to make a copy of the film including a photograph of any image forming
part thereof; (ii) to sell or give on hire or offer for sale or hire, any copy
of the film, regardless of whether such copy has been sold or given on hire on
earlier occasions; (iii) to communicate the film to the public.
53\. The Sales Tax Law applies when there is sale/purchase of goods.
Therefore to attract Value Added Tax, whether as normal sale or deemed
sale, the transaction should be in relation to goods. The legislative
competence is to be seen with reference to the object of the levy viz.,
temporary transfer of copyright or permitting the use or enjoyment. All the
writ petitioners are producers/distributors of Cinematograph film. Producer
transfers the copyright of the film to the distributor or exhibitor. The
distributor in turn transfers copyright to the sub-distributor/area-
distributor/ exhibitor. There are various modes of transaction in the film
industry. It is therefore required to be seen whether those transactions
between the producer and the distributor, distributor and sub-distributor or
exhibitor are normal sale or deemed sale or temporary transfer of
copyright, permitting to use or enjoyment of the copyright.
54\. According to Petitioners, the transactions between producer and the
distributor, distributor and sub-distributor or exhibitor involves delivery of
goods i.e. positive prints or cubes of the picture, which amounts to sale
within the meaning of Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Article
366(12) of the Constitution has defined the word goods for the purpose of
the Constitution as including all materials, commodities, and articles. The
word goods has also been defined in Section 2(7) of the Sales of Goods Act,
1930 as meaning every kind of movable property other than actionable claims
and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things
attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before
sale or under the contract of sale. The State sales tax legislations have,
subject to minor variations, adopted substantially a similar definition of
goods for the purpose of their Sales Tax Acts.
55\. States have exercised their power to levy a tax on the sale of goods
and Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 charges transaction of sale or
transfer of use of copyright under Section 3 of the Act read with Serial No.70
of Part-B of the First Schedule to the Act. Our attention was drawn to the
definition of sale under Section 2(33) of Tamil Nadu VAT Act which reads as
under:-
Section 2(33) 'Sale' with all its grammatical variations and cognate
expressions means every transfer of the property in goods (other than by way
of a mortgage, hypothecation, charge or pledge) by one person to another in
the course of business for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration and includes,-
(i)a transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract of property in any
goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(ii)a transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract;
(iii)a delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by
instalments;
(iv)a transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not
for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration;
(v)a supply of goods any un-incorporated association or body of persons to a
member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(vi)a supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or
any drink (whether or not intoxicating) where such supply of service is for
cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer,
delivery or supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by
the person making the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those
goods by the person to whom such transfer, delivery or supply is made. .....
To the same effect, is the definition of sale under Section 2(g) of Central
Sales Tax Act.
56\. State of Tamil Nadu charges transaction of sale or transfer of use of
copyright under Section 3 of Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act read with Serial
No.70 of Part-B of First Schedule to the Act. Serial No.70 in Part-B reads as
under:-

57\. There have been several decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the
interpretation of the word goods in the context of different State sales tax
enactments. In number of decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
word goods for the purpose of sale tax may be tangible or intangible
property. In Tata Consultancy Services Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2001) 4
SCC 629, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as Under:-
A 'goods', may be a tangible property or an intangible one. It would become
goods provided it has the attributes thereof having regard to (a) its utility;
(b) capable of being bought and sold; and (c) capable of being transmitted,
transferred, delivered, stored and possessed. If a software whether customised
or non-customised satisfies these attributes, the same would be goods.
58\. To contend that goods may be tangible property or intangible one,
reliance was also placed upon (2004) 137 STC 117 (S.P.S.Jayam and Co. v.
Registrar, Tamil Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal and others) where the transfer
of trademark, an intangible property was held to be goods as per Tamil Nadu
General Sales Tax Act, 1959. Division Bench of this Court held that the
Trademark is the property right and it exclusively belongs to the party who
has registered it and transfer of right to use the trademark is an intangible
and transfer of right to use for trademark for consideration is deemed sale
and therefore, the consideration is taxable under Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax
Act, 1959.
59\. Whether temporary transfer of copyright or permission to use or
enjoyment amounts to sale of goods or deemed sale within the meaning of
Article 366(29A) of the Constitution, as contended by the Petitioners is to be
examined, keeping in view the normal business practice in the film industry
and in the light of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
various decisions upholding the levy of service tax.
60\. The producer of the film, who owns the intellectual property rights of
the film temporarily transfers the rights to a person (normally Distributor or
any other person), who in turn directly or indirectly enters into an agreement
with sub-distributor, area distributor, exhibitor or theatre owner.
Exploitation activities of the cinematograph film normally takes place in the
following way:
Film Producer/Copyright Holder | | | | \\./ Distributor | | | | \\./ Sub-
Distributor | | | | \\./ Exhibitor | | | | \\./ Theatre-owner There are
various modes of transactions in the film industry.
61\. The distributor purchases the theatrical distribution rights from the
producer for exhibiting the film in a defined territory. The distributor
performs functions such as:
1.part-financing of film (in case of minimum guarantee/ advance based purchase
of film rights)
2.localised marketing of film
3.selection of exhibition halls
4.managing the logistics of physical print distribution.
62\. Mr.Sundareswaran, the learned counsel for respondents submitted that
there are three popular approaches to transfer distribution rights via
distribution contracts as under:
1. Minimum Guarantee + Royalty  Here, the producer sells the distribution
rights for a defined territory for a minimum lump sum irrespective of the box
office performance of the film. Any surplus is shared between the producer and
distributor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:2) after deducting entertainment
tax, show rentals, commission, print costs and publicity costs. Effectively,
the distributor becomes a financier in the eyes of the market. This is the
most common channel available to high budget producers.
2\. Commission  Here, the distributor pays the producer the entire box office
collection after deducting commission. So, the entire risk of box office
performance of the film remains with the producer. This is the most common
channel available to low budget producers.
3\. Outright Sale  Here, the producer sells all distribution and theatrical
rights for a defined territory exclusively to a distributor. Effectively, the
distributor becomes a producer in the yes of the market. So, the entire risk
of box office performance of the film remains with the distributor.
63\. In the Writ petitions, the petitioners have enumerated certain modes of
business transactions between the Producer and the Distributor as between the
Distributor and exhibitor. We feel it appropriate to briefly refer to those
transactions.
a. Outright Assignment: Outright assignment is made of either of the totality
of the rights or specific rights such as satellite rights, broadcasting
rights, cable television rights, territorial rights and internet rights. The
assignment may be perpetual. The agreement is accompanied by delivery of the
goods being the master or CD tapes of the assigned film.
b. Lease: The producer leases the distribution/exhibition rights for a
specific territory for consideration. The lease is for a given period, which
is normally 5 years from the date of first release of the picture. The
producer provides prints at the cost of the lessee and on being informed, the
lessee takes delivery of the prints and make arrangements for exhibition of
the film in the theatres. The lessee has no right to sell or make available
the prints by subsequent lease and bound to return the prints at the expiry of
the lease.
c. Percentage of Share:- The producer gives exclusive distribution rights for
a period of 5 years or so. In consideration, the distributor is entitled to
share at a certain percentage, say, 20% of the net realisation throughout the
run of the movie. Immediately, setting off the share against any distribution
advance, statement of accounts is rendered to the producer each month showing
the theatres, place of screening, period of run and share amount. The prints
have to be returned at the expiry of the agreement. If the producer chooses to
sell his lease rights, the entire profits should first be appropriated towards
the advance given by the distributor in the event of sale. The distributor is
guaranteed on 10% realization or such percentage of the sale amount.
d. Profit Share:- There are agreements in which the producer and the
distributor operate on profit sharing basis in which the distributor is
entitled to a specific percentage of the realization, in lieu of which the
distributor provides upfront advance to the producer (to be adjusted) and
looks to the exhibition arrangements.
64\. Even if the exhibitor/theatre owner merely lets out the premises to the
distributor or sub-distributor or area distributor, there are other business
support services rendered by the theatre owner. The definition of business
support service has been amended in 2011 by means of a Circular bearing
No.148/17/2011-ST dated 13.12.2011 (bearing F.No.354/27/2011-TRU) issued by
the Central Board of Excise and Customs, New Delhi to include operational or
administrative assistance in any manner in its definition. The said Circular
is under challenge in W.P.No.3948 of 2012, etc., batch.
65\. Even though it was contended that the transaction is between the producer
and the distributor and the distributor gets the absolute right over the
cinematograph film, in reality, the distributor does not get the absolute
rights. The distributor only gets few positive prints or cubes of the picture
for the exhibition of the picture in the specified area. In otherwords, it is
a temporary transfer of the copyright or permission to use or enjoyment for
the limited period in the specified area. As rightly contended by the
respondents, exclusive right of copyright ordinarily vests with the producer
of the film. Even in outright assignment, the transfer is not absolute. In the
case of a lease, it is for a given period. The levy of tax on any transaction
is based on the criterion whether the transfer of right is permanent or
temporary. So long as the producer does not fully relinquish his right over
the copyright held by him, transfer of the right to use is purely temporary
and in those cases, levy of service tax for such transfer of copyright would
apply. The Service Provider is the Producer,who is the owner of the
Intellectual Property and the service receiver is the person who temporarily
gets the right to use the Intellectual Property who is the Distributor and
service tax is leviable on such temporary transfer of copyright.
66\. Normally, producer of a movie exploits the film in many ways i.e.,
assigning copyrights to distributor(s) for exhibition in threatres; or the
producer himself exhibits the film by engaging theatres; exploitation of
satellite rights, T.V. channels, audio/video, etc. The right given to the
distributor is restricted to exploiting the contents of the film through a
film/digital format through exhibition in theatres in a specific area and for
specified time. Even though the copyright of the film is assigned to a
distributor for a specific area for a limited period, the producer reserves
his right to exploit the film in other media. So long as the transaction does
not amount to sale or permanent transfer, it is only a temporary transfer of
copyright or permit its use by another person for a consideration. The Service
Provider is the Producer who owns the copyright of the film and Service
receiver is the Distributor who temporarily owns the copyright of the film for
consideration.
67\. The learned counsel for petitioner Mr.Prasad produced copies of various
agreements and deeds of assignments entered into between the producers and
distributors and exhibitors and contended that the transaction is only
delivery of goods for consideration and therefore service tax cannot be
levied on such transaction.
68\. We perused the 'Distribution Agreement' dated 21.8.2008 executed in
favour of Jupiter Films (in respect of Tamil movie - "Jeyam kondaan" for a
consideration of Rs.35,00,000/-), produced by Sathya Jyothi Films, petitioner
in W.P.No.483 of 2011. Though we are required to decide the vires of Section
65(105)(zzzzt), we refer to the said agreements for reference as a sample. By
perusal of the said Distribution Agreement, it is seen that the Distribution
Agreement is not mere delivery of positive prints but there are following
mutual activities to be performed both by the Producer and the Distributor.
Producer:
Producer shall supply free of cost 10 number of colour and scope positive
prints or cubes of the picture, DTS disc, blowups, photocards, audio
cassettes, etc., for exhibition purposes in the said area.
Producer shall announce the general release of the said picture in advance.
Distributor:
Distributor shall exhibit the prints of the film only in the areas covered
under the agreement and shall not allow exhibition of the prints in any other
areas.
Distributor shall book good theatres at best possible terms and shall take
prior consent of the producers and the booking of screening centres will be on
terms basis or on minimum Guarantee basis.
Distributor shall carry out the local and theatre publicities for promotion of
the picture and the Distributor has to take prior written sanction and the
budget approval from the Distributor.
The Distributor shall surrender the rights with prints and publicities at the
end of the Agreement period or in the event of sale to third party.
69\. The above mutual activities would show that notwithstanding the
distribution agreement, the producer retains the right to deal with and
dispose of the rights of the agreement to any third parties. The Producer also
retains the right to screen the picture over the satellite channels,
Doordarshan channels, etc., at any time after certain period (six months from
its first and general release of the picture). Various clauses in the
distribution agreement would clearly show that the distribution agreement is
only a temporary transfer of copyright or permission to use or enjoyment of
the film by exhibiting the film in a specified area for a specific period of
time. While the producer retains his right to exploit the film , there is no
transfer of right to use the goods amounting to sale within the meaning of
Article 366(29A). On the otherhand, it is a temporary transfer of copyright or
permitting its use or enjoyment by the lessee. The Producer is the Service
Provider and the lessee is the recipient of the service and service tax is
leviable on such temporary transfer or permitting use or enjoyment.
70\. We have also perused the "lease agreement" between M/s.Vikatan Publishing
Solutions Private Limited and Ms/.Ananda Pictures Circuit (Petitioner in
W.P.No.482 of 2011) (in respect of film 'Siva Manasula Sakthi' for a period of
five years for a consideration of Rs.1,01,50,0000/-). By perusal of the said
lease agreement, it is seen that the lease was for exhibition of the film in a
specific area for a limited period. Though lease right was given to the lessee
for a specific area, Producer of the film/lessor reserved his right to exhibit
the film in few theatres/complexes located in the area covered under the lease
itself. That apart, the Producer retains his right to exploit through
satellite, T.V. Channels, digital rights, audio rights, DVD rights, song
sequences and all other rights to any of the T.V.channels. When the producer
continued to retain his ownership of the film, it cannot be said that the
lease amounts to transfer of right to use the goods amounting to sale
within the meaning of Article 366(29A).
71\. Agreement between the Distributor and Exhibitor (theatre owner):-
It was submitted that agreements are also entered into between the Distributor
and an Exhibitor (theatres) and the business is patterned on different lines
based on commercial exigency. The distributor transfers the copyrights to sub-
distributor, area distributor, exhibitor or theatre owner. This agreement can
be of different types. It is necessary to examine different types of
arrangements and in order to determine whether the activities undertaken by a
theatre owner and a distributor is sale of goods or transfer of right to
use the goods.
72\. Mr.Sundareswaran, the learned counsel for respondents has submitted that
by and large there are following four popular approaches to transfer
exhibition rights via exhibition contracts:
1.Theatre Hire  Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor the entire box
office collection after deducting entertainment tax and show rentals. So, the
entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the
distributor. This is the most common channel for low-budget films, causing
rank newcomers, with unproven track record.
2.Fixed Hire  Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a maximum lump sum
irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Rental is not
chargeable per show. Any surplus after deducting entertainment tax is retained
by the exhibitor. Effectively, the exhibitor becomes a producer in the eyes
of the market. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film
remains with the exhibitor. This is the most common channel for high budget
films, casting established front-runners, with proven track record.
3.Minimum Guarantee + Royalty  Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a
minimum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Any
surplus after deducting entertainment tax and show rental is shared in a pre-
set ratio (typically 2:1) between the exhibitor and distributor. But risk of
deficit remains with the exhibitor. This is the most common channel preferred
by single screens.
4.Revenue Share  Here, the exhibitor shares with the distributor, in a pre-
set ratio (typically 1:2), the entire box office collection of the film after
deducting entertainment tax. Rental is not chargeable per show. So, the entire
risk of box office performance of the film is shared between the exhibitor and
distributor. This is the most common channel preferred by multiplex screens.
In the first category, the profit or loss from exhibiting the film is borne by
the Distributor. In such a case, the theatre owner provides the taxable
service within the meaning of Section 65(105)(zzzz) \- renting of the
immovable property for furtherance of business or commerce (vires of Section
65(105)(zzzz) is under challenge in a batch of writ petitions). Depending upon
the terms of the agreement, the theatre owner also renders operational or
administrative assistance and is liable to pay service tax in respect of
renting of immovable property and also other operational and administrative
assistance, (Circular dated 13.12.2011 clarifying the levy of service tax on
distributors/sub-distributors of films and exhibitors) is the subject matter
of challenge in W.P.No.3948 of 2012 etc., batch). Another type of arrangement
is where the contract between the theatre owner and the Distributor is on the
revenue sharing basis i.e., a fixed and pre-determined, i.e., a percentage of
revenue earned from selling the tickets goes to the theatre owner and the
balance goes to the Distributor. The two contracting parties act on the basis
of the agreement and depending on the terms of the agreement, service is
provided by either side. This kind of arrangement  revenue sharing
arrangement between the distributor/sub-distributor/area distributor and the
theatre owner is the subject matter of clarification in the impugned Circular
which is under challenge in another batch. Suffice to note that the said
arrangement does not fall under "delivery of goods" amounting to sale/transfer
of right to use the goods to attract sale tax.
73\. No transfer of right to use:- As held by the Supreme Court in the
decision of B.S.N.L. Vs. Union of India, (2006) 3 SCC 1, to constitute a
transaction for the transfer of the right to use the goods the transaction
must have the following attributes:
a. There must be goods available for delivery;
b. There must be a consensus ad idem as to the identity of the goods;
c. The transferee should have a legal right to use the goods - consequently
all legal consequences of such use including any permissions or licenses
required therefor should be available to the transferee;
d. For the period during which the transferee has such legal right, it has to
be the exclusion to the transferor - this is the necessary concomitant of the
plain language of the statute - viz. a "transfer of the right to use" and not
merely a licence to use the goods;
e. Having transferred the right to use the goods during the period for which
it is to be transferred, the owner cannot again transfer the same rights to
others.
74\. To satisfy the parameters/attributes as laid down in B.S.N.L. Vs. Union
of India, (2006) 3 SCC 1, the goods must be available for delivery, there
should be consensus as regards identity of goods, transferee should have a
legal right to use the goods, and such legal right has to be to the exclusion
of the transferor and having transferred the right to use, during the period
the owner cannot again transfer the same rights to others. The characteristics
noted above are available in the case of assignment/lease/transfer of
copyright and so subjected to VAT.
75\. In our opinion, none of these attributes are present in the agreement
between the producer and the distributor and the distributor and the theatre
owner. Even while the films were in use by the distributor/exhibitor, the same
are under the effective control of the producer. The distributor is not free
to make use of the same for other works like satellite rights, T.V. Channels,
exploitation of song, audio/video, D.V.D. etc., The distributor cannot make
use of the film according to his wishes, but there is only temporary transfer
or permission to use or enjoyment for consideration as per the terms of the
agreement.
76\. Re.contention: Assignment agreement in perpetuity:- Mr.Prasad, learned
counsel for petitioner drew our attention to Absolute Assignment Agreement of
television, satellite, broadcasting rights between Sathya Jothi Films and
M/s.Sun T.V.Net Work dated 5.7.2010 (in respect of the film Baana Kaathadi
for a consideration of Rs.95,00,000/-) and contended that in such type of
assignment agreements in perpetuity right is permanently transferred and no
right is retained by the Producer and such rights certainly amounts to sale/
transfer of right to use the goods for which VAT is levied and in such type of
transaction no service tax could be levied. Under the said agreement, the
assignor assigned to the assignee exclusive copyright in respect of Satellite
Television Broadcast, DTH, Direct Satellite Service, Terrestrial Television
Broadcast and all other rights connected therewith for exhibition of the film
through Television Broadcast for the entire world. The learned counsel for
petitioner has drawn our attention to certain clauses and submitted that in
respect of satellite television, DTH and all other connected rights, the
Assignor/producer of the film relinquished his rights over others rights and
the assignment in favour of the assignee is in perpetuity.
77\. Of course, the nature of transaction in each case determines leviability
of service tax. Each transaction should be considered individually to find out
as to whether it is a sale or service. In this regard, it is pertinent to
note that in these batch of writ petitions, when the Department sent
communications to the producers informing them of the introduction of the said
taxable service in the Union Budget 2010, the Producers were requested to
furnish documents/ particulars relating to the rendering of said service for
verification. As details called for were not furnished, reminder letters were
sent and without complying with the Department's request for submission of the
documents, the Producers approached the Court by filing writ petitions.
Therefore, the nature of transaction in respect of assignment agreement dated
5.7.2010 could not have been examined by the Department. In any event, any one
such transaction cannot be a ground to hold that the impugned provision is
unconstitutional.
78\. In INFO TECH SOFTWARE DEALERS ASSOCATION Vs. UNION OF INDIA 2010 (20) STR
289, (Madras), the challenge was to the legislative competence of the
Parliament to impose service tax on software supplied to a customer pursuant
to a end user licence agreement under section 65 (105)(zzzze). In the said
case, identical contention, as raised in these Petitions, were raised stating
that Software is goods and all transactions would amount to sale. The said
writ petition was dismissed holding that software is goods and whether the
transaction would amount to sale or service would depend upon individual
transaction and for the reason of that challenge, the amended provision cannot
be held to be unconstitutional so long as the Parliament has legislative
competency to enact law in respect of service under Entry 97 of List-I.
79\. Exclusion of permanent transfer of copyrights:- It is also pertinent to
note that permanent transfer of rights is excluded from service tax. At the
time of levy of service tax on taxable service of Intellectual Property Rights
(IPRs) as defined in sections 65(105)(zzr) of the Act, the Department
clarified as follows:
A permanent transfer of intellectual property right does not amount to
rendering of service. On such transfer, the person selling these rights no
longer remains a 'holder of intellectual property right' so as to come under
the purview of taxable service. Thus, there would not be any service tax on
permanent transfer of IPRs. (Circular No.80/10/2004-ST, dated 17-9-2004 para
9.2) The same proposition applies to copyright which is another form of
intellectual property right. Thus, permanent transfer of copyright will not
amount to rendering of service and therefore, will be excluded from the
purview of service tax.
80\. Re.contention : Levy of service tax amounts to Double Taxation:-
Learned counsel submitted that considering the import of feature films as
goods, Customs duty is levied under Customs Act,1962 and Chapter 37 of the
Customs Tariff Covers every type of Cinematograph film. The learned counsel
submitted that excise duty can be levied only on goods. It was also contended
that cinematograph films have been considered as excisable goods through
Chapter 37 of the Central Excise Tariff Act. The learned counsel further
submitted that Excise and Customs, which are wings of Ministry of Finance,
have treated films as goods only and while so the same Ministry of Finance
cannot levy service tax calling it as service. Therefore, it is the attempt of
the petitioner to demonstrate before this Court that in respect of the same
transaction if Service Tax is leviable or charged, it would amount to double
taxation and the same would be not valid in law.
81\. Sofar as the levy of Central Excise Duty, the taxable event is
manufacture goods and so far as Value Added Tax, the taxable event is the sale
of the goods. Since, both these duties are payable, it cannot be generally
stated that double taxation is not permissible under Law. Further, it is to be
noted that the taxable event in the case of Central Excise Duty is not
directly on the goods, but it is on the manufacture of the goods, whereas the
Sales Tax/Value Added Tax is imposed with specific reference to the goods,
which are sold and sale is the taxable event, sofar as Sales Tax/ Value Added
Tax, whereas Service Tax is a value added tax.
82\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BSNL vs. UOI, explained the "aspect
doctrine" by observing that the doctrine merely deals with legislation
competence. As held in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant vs. UOI, subjects
which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the power of a particular
legislature may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within the
another legislative power. It was further held that there may be overlapping,
but the overlapping must be in law and the transaction may involve two or more
taxable events in different aspects, but the fact that there is overlapping
does not detract from the distinctiveness of the aspects.
83\. Considering the nature of various arrangements between the producer and
the distributor, distributor/sub-distributor and theatre owner, we are of the
view that there is only temporary transfer or permission to use or enjoyment
for consideration on certain terms and conditions in a specified area.
Irrespective of the arrangement of rights to the distributor to a specific
area for a limited period, the Producer retains the original copyrights. The
sale of goods can be said to have taken place only when the producer
relinquishes his right and title over the goods; but when he keeps grip over
the goods transferred for temporary use or enjoyment on certain terms and
conditions. When the transactions are not sale or deemed sale, the same
cannot be brought under Entry 54 of List II or Entry 92A of List I.
84\. Before exclusive legislative competence can be claimed for Parliament by
resort to the residuary power, the legislative incompetence of the State
Legislative must be clearly established. Entry 97 itself is specific that a
matter can be brought under that Entry only if it is not enumerated in List II
or List III and in the case of tax, if it is not mentioned in either of these
two Lists. [INTERNATIONAL TOURIST CORPORATION AND OTHERS v. STATE OF HARYANA
(AIR 1981 SC 774)].
85\. The impugned levy is a tax on service and in terms of the definition of
taxable service under section 65 (105)(zzzzt), it means any service provided
or to be provided to any person by any other person and two types of such
services are contemplated one being transferring temporarily and the other
being permitting the use or enjoyment of copyright. Therefore, the impugned
levy is not a levy of tax on the "transfer of the right to use the goods",
but, on the service provided or to be provided for transferring temporarily or
permitting the use or enjoyment of any copyright, except the rights covered
under section 13(1)(a) of the Copyright Act. It is a levy which is distinct
from the levy under Entry 54 of List II or Entry 92A of List I. Therefore,
there is nothing wrong for Parliament to claim taxing power under Entry 97 of
List I and all that is required to be shown is that that tax is not mentioned
in List II or List III. Resorting to Entry 97 of List I. The Parliament
brought out the amendment  Section 65(105)(zzzzt) bringing the activity of
temporary transfer or permission to use or enjoy the copyright for
consideration under the ambit of service tax net on the service provided by
resorting to Entry 97 of List I and the same cannot be said to be ultra vires
the Constitution.
86\. Service Tax - Value Addition on activities:- As held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, service tax is a tax on activity, is a value added tax and
the value addition is on account of the activity, which provides value
addition. It gives value addition to the goods manufactured or produced or
sold on account of activities the film exhibited. Thus, service tax is imposed
every time service is rendered. The taxable event in each exercise/activity
undertaken by the service provider and each time, service tax gets attracted.
87\. Elaborating upon the value addition and observing that value addition
comes in an account of activity undertaken by the professional, in (2011) 2
SCC 352 [Association of Leasing and Financial Services Companies v. Union of
India and others], the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:-
Nature and character of service tax 
38\. In All India Federation of Tax Practitioners' case (2007) 7 SCC 527, this
Court explained the concept of service tax and held that service tax is a
value added tax (VAT, for short) which in turn is a destination based
consumption tax in the sense that it is levied on commercial activities and it
is not a charge on the business but on the consumer. That, service tax is an
economic concept based on the principle of equivalence in a sense that
consumption of goods and consumption of services are similar as they both
satisfy human needs. Today with the technological advancement there is a very
thin line which divides a sale from service. That, applying the principle
of equivalence, there is no difference between production or manufacture of
saleable goods and production of marketable/saleable services in the form of
an activity undertaken by the service provider for consideration, which
correspondingly stand consumed by the service receiver. It is this principle
of equivalence which is inbuilt into the concept of service tax under the
Finance Act, 1994. That service tax is, therefore tax on an activity. That,
service tax is a value added tax. The value addition is on account of the
activity which provides value addition, for example, an activity undertaken by
a chartered accountant or a broker is an activity undertaken by him based on
his performance and skill. This is from the point of view of the professional.
However, from the point of view of his client, the chartered accountant/broker
is his service provider. The value addition comes in on account of the
activity undertaken by the professional like tax planning, advising,
consultation, etc. It gives value addition to the goods manufactured or
produced or sold. Thus, service tax is imposed every time service is rendered
to the customer/client. This is clear from the provisions of section
65(105)(zm) of the Finance Act, 1994 (as amended). Thus, the taxable event is
each exercise/activity undertaken by the service provider and each time
service tax gets attracted."
Same is the view taken earlier by the Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Godfrey Phillips India Limited v. State of U.P. (2005) 2
SCC 515, in which, the Supreme Court observed that in the classical sense a
tax is composed of two elements : the person, thing or activity on which tax
is imposed. Thus, every tax may be levied on an object or on the event of
taxation. Service tax is, thus a tax on activity whereas sales tax is a tax on
sale of a thing or goods.
88\. Film produced by the producer does not fetch any value unless it passes
through various commercial activities including the distribution agreements
and gets exhibited. As held by the Supreme Court, service tax is a "value
added tax, which in turn, is a general tax, which applies to all commercial
activities involving production of goods cinematograph films and provision of
services from the stage of production  negative of the films are made till
it gets exhibited in theatre or exploited through other media. Lot of
economic/commercial activities are involved. Those commercial activities
amounting to temporary transfer of copyright or permitting use or enjoyment of
copyright, Parliament is well within its competence to levy service tax.
Transfer of right to use the goods or permission to use the copyright or
enjoyment of copyright operate in different fields. There may be
overlapping. The impugned legislation cannot be held to be vitiated merely
because there is overlapping and that both sales tax and service tax becomes
leviable.
89\. Point No.3 : Re.contention  No element of service is involved:-
Contention of Petitioners is that tax is leviable only on services provided
i.e. on the value addition and there is no service or element of service in
the act of temporary transfer or permitting use or enjoyment of a copyright to
another for his business. Further contention of Petitioners is that in Tamil
Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Association case (2004) 5 SCC 632, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court pointed out various services rendered by Mandap keepers. It was
contended in Association of Leasing and Financial Services Companies case
(2011) 2 SCC 352 also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court pointed out number of
financial services rendered by Non-Banking Financial Companies in respect of
hire purchase agreements and in the act of temporary transfer or permitting
use or enjoyment of copyright of cinematographic film to another, no services
are rendered by the producer/ distributor or cinema theatre owner (exhibitor)
and therefore, levy of service tax on those acts is not maintainable.
90\. The term service cannot be understood in a layman's point of view. In
Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Association case, (2004) 5 SCC 632, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that levy of service tax on a particular kind of service
could not be struck down on the ground that it does not conform to a common
understanding of the word service so long as it does not transgress any
specific restriction contained in the Constitution.
91\. It has to be borne in mind the distinction pointed out by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd v. Union of India
(2005) 4 SCC 214 i.e. (i) object of tax; (ii) instances of tax and (iii)
machinery for collection of tax. The legislative competence is to be
determined with reference to the object of levy and not with reference to its
incidence or machinery. In Gujarat Ambuja Cement Limited case, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court at Paragraph No.28 of the Judgment, summarized the principles
for determining the constitutionality of statute as under:-
"(a) The substance of the impugned Act must be looked at to determine whether
it is in pith and substance within a particular entry whatever its ancillary
effect may be [Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee v. Bank of Commerce Ltd. and others
(AIR 1947 PC 60, at p. 65, A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras 1957 SCR 399, State
of Rajasthan v. G. Chawla (1959 Supp. (1) SCR 904, Katra Educational Society
v. State of U.P. 1996 (3) SCR 328, D.C. Johar & Sons (P) Ltd. v. STO 1971 (27)
STC 120 and Kannan Devan Hills Produce v. State of Kerala (1972) 2 SCC 218].
(b) Where the encroachment is ostensibly ancillary but in truth beyond the
competence of the enacting authority, the statute will be a colourable piece
of legislation and constitutionally invalid (A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras
1957 SCR 399, , A.B. Abdul Kadir v. State of Kerala (1976) 3 SCC 219, SCC at
p. 232 and Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Assn. of India v. Union of India ,
SCC at p. 651). If the statute is legislatively competent the enquiry into the
motive which persuaded Parliament or the State Legislature into passing the
Act is irrelevant (Dharam Dutt v. Union of India 2004 (1) SCALE 425).
(c) Apart from passing the test of legislative competency, the Act must be
otherwise legally valid and would also have to pass the test of
constitutionality in the sense that it cannot be in violation of the
provisions of the Constitution nor can it operate extraterritorially. (See
Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras 1953 SCR 677S.)"
92\. The legislative competence of the Parliament does not depend upon whether
any services are made available within the definition of taxable services
contained in Finance Act, and in a given case, taxable services are rendered
or not is a matter of interpretation of the statute and for adjudication under
the provisions of the Statute and the same cannot affect the vires of the
legislation and/ or the legislative competence of the Parliament. Therefore,
the Supreme Court held that the levy of service tax on a particular kind of
service could not be struck down on the ground that it does not conform to
common understanding of the word service so long as it does not transgress
any specific restriction contained in the Constitution.
93\. At this juncture, it is to be noted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
MAFFTALAL INDUSTRIES LTD.,v UNION OF INDIA [(1997) 5, SCC 536], held that in
the matter of taxation laws the Court permits a great latitude to the
discretion of the legislature and the State is allowed to pick and choose
objects, persons, methods, and even rates for taxation, thereby having wide
discretion.
94\. Point Nos 4 and 5 - Parliament cannot dissect the transaction:-
Contention of Petitioners is that transfer of copyrights/agreements are
composite in form i.e. sale/transfer of right to use goods, coupled with
services and Parliament has no competence to dissect such composite
transaction. Petitioners contended that unless the transaction in truth
represents two distinct and separate contracts and the contracts are
discernible and that the State would not have power to separate the agreement
to sell merely agreement to render service and impose tax on service.
Placing reliance upon (2006) 3 SCC 1 [BSNL and another v. Union of India], it
was contended that dominant nature test is the vital test to determine the
nature of transaction. It was further submitted that in the light of the
principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, adopting dominant nature
test, the temporary transfer of copyright is only a deemed sale within the
meaning of Article 366(29A) and Parliament cannot dissect the element of
service from dominant nature of transaction.
95\. Reliance was also placed upon yet another decision of Supreme Court in
(1989) 3 SCC 634 (Federation of Hotel & Restaurant v. Union of India and
others). In the said case, challenge was to the levy of tax under the
Expenditure Tax Act, 1987 enacted by Parliament. The Act envisaged a tax at 10
percent ad valorem on chargeable expenditure incurred in the class of
hotels, wherein room charges for any unit of residential accommodation are
over Rs.400/- per day per individual. The chargeable expenditure included
expenditure incurred on payments made in such class of hotels in connection
with the provision of accommodation, residential or otherwise, food or drink
etc. The challenge was on the ground that Entry 62 in List II conferred
exclusive power on the State Legislature to levy tax on luxuries and Entry
54 in List II empowered the State to levy tax on the sale of goods. The
contention was that since the expenditure tax and tax on the sale of goods
were covered by the Entries in the State List, there was nothing left for
Parliament to tax. In the context of the said controversy, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held as under:-
14. ...... Indeed, the law 'with respect to' a subject might incidentally
'affect' another subject in some way; but that is not the same thing as the
law being on the latter subject. There might be overlapping; but the
overlapping must be in law. The same transaction may involve two or more
taxable events in its different aspects. But the fact that there is an
overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the aspects. Lord
Simonds in Governor General in Council v. Province of Madras, 1945 FCR 179 at
p.193 : (AIR 1945 PC 98 at p. 101) in the context of concepts of Duties of
Excise and Tax on Sale of Goods said:
..... The two taxes, the one levied on a manufacturer in respect of his
goods, the other on a vendor in respect of his sales, may, as is there pointed
out, in one sense overlap. But in law there is no overlapping. The taxes are
separate and distinct imposts. If in fact the overlap, that may be because the
taxing authority, imposing a duty of excise, finds it convenient to impose
that duty at the moment when the excisable article leaves the factory or
workshop for the first time on the occasion of its sale ......  Upholding the
levy of Expenditure Tax the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:-
49. ..... The object of a tax on luxury is to impose a tax on the enjoyment
of certain types of benefits, facilities and advantages on which the
legislature wishes to impose a curb. The idea is to encourage society to cater
better to the needs of those who cannot afford them. ...... The object of an
expenditure tax  and, that, conceptually, there can be an expenditure tax is
borne out by Azam Jah's case (AIR 1972 SC 2319) is to discourage expenditure
which the legislature considers lavish or ostentatious. The object of the
first would be to discourage certain types of living or enjoyment while that
of the second would be to discourage people from incurring expenditure
unproductive or undesirable channels. ..... The Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that there is no overlapping at all and the pith and substance of the central
tax could well be described as expenditure and not luxuries and the
distinction is not obliterated merely because of the circumstance that both
legislatures have chosen to attract the same area of vulnerability, one with a
view to keep a check on luxuries and the other with a view to curb
undesirable 'expenditure'.
96\. In fact, an identical contention was raised before the Supreme Court in
the case of ASSOCIATION OF LEASING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES v UNION OF INDIA,
contending that Hire purchase and leasing is constitutionally characterised as
a sale (deemed sale) by the Constitution (46th amendment) Act, and the said
subject matter can be taxed only under Entry 54, list II, and it cannot be
taxed under Entry 97- List I. Reliance was placed on the decision in BHARAT
SANCHAR NIGAM LTD., (2006) 3 SCC 1, to contend that of all the different kinds
of composite transactions the drafters of the 46th amendment chose three
specifications, works contract, hire purchase contract and catering contract
to bring within the fiction of deemed sale and of these three, the first and
third involve a kind of service and sale at the same time and hire purchase
does not involve a sale and service and therefore, service tax cannot be
levied on the interest / finance charges, which was sought to be done.
97\. Rejecting the contention it was held that financial leasing services are
sought to be taxed under section 65(12)(a)(i), the taxable event is indicated
in section 65 (105)(zm) and the provision operates qua an activity of
funding/financing of equipment/ asset under equipment leasing under which a
lessee is free to select, order, take delivery and maintain the asset. It was
held that the taxable event is a service which is rendered by the finance
company to its customer and thus section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994, seeks to
tax financial services rendered with reference to the income earned by way of
interest / finance charges. In such circumstances, the question of splitting
up of transactions does not arise as the service tax in such case is neither
on the material nor on sale, but it is on the activity of financing/funding of
equipment/asset within the meaning of the words, financial leasing services
in section 65 (12)(a)(i).
98\. It is to be stated permission to use and transferring temporarily or
enjoy the intangible goods such as designs, patents and trademarks were
subject matter of levy to service tax from 2004. Though copyright is also once
such intangible item, it was excluded from the scope vide section 65 (55a).
Now copyright service has been brought under the category of taxable service,
by virtue of section 65 (105)(zzzzt). Therefore, the respondents may be
justified in stating that when temporary transfer of other categories of
intellectual property such as designs, patents and trademarks are liable to
service tax, there is no justifiable reason to exclude copyright services from
such category.
99\. Re.contention  Aspect Principle:-
The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted in the matter of
levy of tax by the State, treating the services as sale or levy of service tax
treating sale as service, caution has been uttered by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the Court of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited vs. Union of India (2006) 3
SCC 1, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that the State cannot entrench
upon Union List to tax by including the cost of services in the value of the
goods. Likewise, centre cannot include the value of goods in the cost of
services and matters must be decided by the dominant character of the
transaction in respect of composite contracts of goods and services. It is
further stated that to apply the "Aspect Principle" a single transaction has
to have two separate economic events and only then the Parliament and the
State Legislature can impose tax. Therefore, the respondents have to find a
separate aspect and in the nature of transaction done by the petitioners,
there are no two economic events and there is only one i.e., deemed sale.
100\. In Kerala State Electricity Board vs. Indian Aluminium Company, [AIR
1976 SC 1031 at 1044], a reference has been made to the 'aspect of
legislation', wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held a legislature while
legislating with regard to matters within its competence should be deemed to
know its limits and its legislative authority and should not be deemed to be
legislating beyond its jurisdiction. One thing that has always got to be kept
clear in once mind is that there may be more than one aspect with regard to a
particular subject matter.
101\. Therefore, in the light of the legislative entries with which we are
concerned in these batch of cases, two different activities could properly be
regarded as two different matters for taxation. In other words, there could be
two enactments each in one aspect conferring the power to impose a tax upon
goods. Therefore, the impugned legislation cannot be held to be vitiated,
merely because there is an element of overlapping in that both Sales Tax and
Service Tax becomes leviable on the same assessee in respect of the same
goods. We have discussed about the various aspects of the transaction between
the parties, which were culled out from copies of the agreements, which were
filed along with the writ petitions. From the terms and conditions of the
agreements, it is evidently clear that there are two aspects, namely the
transfer of the right to use the goods or the permission to use the goods or
enjoyment, which operate in different field and merely because there is
overlapping on certain aspects, it would not loose the distinctiveness of each
of the aspects. As observed earlier, the measure of tax or the economic
results cannot be the basis for deciding the vires of the impugned enactment.
102\. Re.contention  Computation is not possible:-
Learned counsel for Petitioners submitted that even assuming that there is
service element, Legislature has not identified the nature of services and
there is no mechanism in the legislation to identify and quantify the taxes.
The learned counsel for the petitioners by relying upon the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in COMMSSIONER V. SRINIVASA SETTY (1981) 2 SCC 460 =
[(1981) 128 ITR 0294], submitted that charging section and computation
provision together constitute an integrated Code and when there is a case to
which computation provisions cannot apply at all, it is evident that such a
case was not intended to fall within the charging section.
103\. Learned counsel for Petitioners submitted that in respect of catering
services, notification is issued for computing the value of taxable service.
Learned counsel further submitted that in respect of leasing transaction 10%
of the value of lease is taken for computing the value of taxable service. In
respect of works contract, Rule 2A of Valuation Rules provides for
determination of computation of value of taxable service. Contention of
Petitioners is that no such mechanism is provided for identifying the nature
of service quantifying the value of the taxable service. Placing reliance upon
(2008) 12 VST 14 (SC) (State of Chhattishgarh and others v. VTP
Constructions), it was submitted that if there is no mechanism to discern the
services rendered and computation thereon, the levy cannot be sustained.
104\. As held by the Supreme Court, in GUJARAT AMBUJA CEMENTS LTD, the
legislative competence is to be determined with reference to the object of the
levy and not with reference to its incidence or machinery. The substance of
the impugned provision must be looked at to determine whether it is in pith
and substance within a particular entry, whatever its ancillary effect may be.
Hence, the decision relied on by the learned counsel does not support the
petitioners' case.
105\. Mr.Sundareswaran, learned counsel for Respondents submitted that to test
the validity of the provision, mode of computation is not relevant and that it
has to be tested on the parameters of S for Subject; P for Person; R for Rate
and M for Measure of Tax. As rightly contended by the learned counsel for
Respondents, basis of computation and ultimate economic results cannot be a
ground to challenge the vires of the impugned provision.
106\. Economic concept of service tax:-
The source of the concept of service tax lies in economics. It is an economic
concept. It was evolved on account of service industry becoming a major
contributor to the GDP of an economy, particularly knowledge-based economy.
With the enactment of Finance Act, 1994, the Central Government derived its
authority from the residuary Entry 97 of the Union List for levying tax on
services.
107\. Learned counsel for Respondents submitted that huge money is involved in
film industry and host of commercial activities are involved right from the
box to theatrical exhibition and service tax is a value added tax on those
commercial activities. Drawing our attention to National Industrial
Classification (All Economic Activities), the learned counsel submitted that
motion picture, video and television programme activities are classified under
head Service (transport, commerce, administration, etc.) and is one of the
important field for contribution of all economic activities towards National
Wealth and for planned development.
108\. Learned counsel for Respondents has also drawn our attention to the
materials and statistics showing that huge money is involved in the
distribution of the films and submitted that levy of service tax is value
addition. Learned counsel for petitioners raised objection for looking into
the statistical datas (National Industrial Classification and also other
materials produced by the learned counsel for respondents).
109\. We do not propose to go into the details of the money involved. Suffice
it to note that driven by series of movies and with more multiplexes and
single theatres on rise right from Cities to Moffusil, there is a huge rise in
business overall. Apart from theatrical exhibition, there are other revenue
streams in Satellite rights, Television Channels rights, Music, Audio and
Video rights. New media rights are no longer insignificant and they account
for substantial percentage of the total revenues. As consistently held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, service tax is on the commercial activities involving
production/temporary transfer of copyright or permission to use or enjoyment
and provision of services service tax is on the host of commercial activities
and provision of services involved.
110\. Conclusion:- We hold that the variant modes of business transactions
between the producer and distributor, distributor and sub-distributor or area
distributor or exhibitor (theatre owner) are not sale of goods to fall under
Entry 54 List II or Entry 92A List I. By resorting to Entry 97 of List I
Residuary Entry to levy service tax, the Parliament is within its legislative
competence and Section 65(105)(zzzzt) is not ultra vires the Constitution.
From the production of the cinematograph film till it is exhibited, there are
host of commercial activities. Service tax is the value added tax, which
applies to the business transactions for consideration involving commercial
activities. Over all, there is a huge rise in business of film industry and
huge money is involved. The temporary transactions of copyrights or the
permission to use or enjoyment of the copyright cannot be brought either under
Entry 54 of List II or Entry 92A of List I. Applying the ratio of the
decisions of the Supreme Court, we hold that the Parliament is well within its
legislative competence in levying service tax resorting to Entry 97 of List I.
111\. In the result, the writ petitions are dismissed. However, there is no
order as to costs. Interim stay granted in various writ petitions stands
vacated. Consequently, all the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
