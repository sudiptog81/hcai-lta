(A) for the year pertaining to the assessment year 2012-13. Therefore, we hold
that the order of the learned CIT (A) has reached its finality for the
assessment year 2012-13.
48.1 Similarly, we also note that the assessee has furnished the necessary
details of the capital work in progress and the amount of interest capitalized
therein. But the learned DR before us has not brought any iota of evidence
contrary to the finding of the learned CIT-A. Hence we do not find a reason to
interfere in the order of the learned ITA. Hence the ground of appeal of the
revenue is dismissed.
In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
49\. In the combined result, all the appeals of the Revenue and Assessee are
partly allowed for statistical purposes.

The captioned appeals have been filed at the instance of the Assessee as well
as Revenue against the separate orders of the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals)-1, Ahmedabad [CIT(A) in short]. In Assessee's appeal, i.e., ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 vide appeal no.CIT(A)-VI/Addl.CIT R-1/288/2011-12 Now
164/CIT(A)-1 dated 21/04/2015 arising in the assessment order passed under
s.143(3) r.w.s.147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961(from now on referred to as "the
Act") dated 28/12/2010 relevant to Assessment Year (AY) 2008-09.
Since all these appeals are inter-connected, therefore these are being
disposed of by way of this consolidated order for the sake of convenience.
First, we take up ITA No. 1990/Ahd/2015 - AY 2008-09. The assessee has raised
the following grounds of appeal:
All the grounds of appeal in this appeal are mutually exclusive and without
prejudice to each other.
Depreciation on Technical Know-how:
1\. The learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-1, Ahmedabad ["the
CIT(A)"] erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of the Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-1, Ahmedabad ("the AO") in valuing the
Technical Know-how at Rs.4,02,89,018/- interest of Rs.12,83,83,923/-
considered by the Appellant.
2\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in restricting the claim of depreciation on Technical Know-how at
Rs.50,36,127/- instead of Rs.1,60,47,865/- claimed by the Appellant and
thereby making addition of Rs.1,10,11,738/- to the income of the Appellant.
3\. Without prejudice to Grounds No.1 & 2, the learned CIT(A) erred in fact
and in law in attributing the differential amount of Rs.8,80,93,905/- (i.e.
difference of Rs.12,83,83,923 - Rs.4,02,89,018) to Goodwill.

Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
-3-
4\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in not allowing depreciation
on Goodwill.
Other Additions:
5\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in disallowing sum of Rs.7,20,500/- claimed u/s.35D of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 (of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as "the
Act")).
6\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in disallowing expenses incurred for documentation charges, processing
fees and stamp duty expenses amounting to Rs.5,24,820/- treating it as capital
expenditure.
7\. Without prejudice to Ground No.6, the learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in
law in not allowing depreciation on the sum of Rs.5,24,820/- treated as
capital expenditure for acquisition of assets.
Interest:
8\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in charging interest u/s.234B of the Act.
9\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in charging interest u/s.234C of the Act.
10\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in charging interest u/s.234D of the Act.
Penalty:
11\. The learned CIT(A) erred in fact and in law in confirming the action of
the AO in initiating penalty proceedings u/s.271(1)(c) of the Act.
12\. Your Appellant craves the right to add to or alter, amend, substitute,
delete or modify all or any of the above grounds of appeal.
The 1st issue raised by the assessee in ground Nos. 1 to 4 is that the learned
CIT (A) erred in restricting the addition of the depreciation for ₹1,10,11,738
only out of the total depreciation claimed by it at Rs.1,60,47,865.00 only on
the technical know-how.
2\. Briefly stated facts are that the assessee in the present case is a
limited company and engaged in the manufacturing business of automotive ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1)
Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.

components. The assessee in the year under consideration has acquired the
business of bright brothers Ltd (for short BBL) as a going concern on the slum
sale basis on a consideration of Rs. 1489.00 million only. The assessee, while
purchasing the business as discussed above, has not assigned the value to the
individual assets acquired by it. Accordingly, the assessee after the
acquisition of the business has recorded the assets and the liabilities
acquired in the slump sale after assigning the values to individual assets and
liabilities based on the valuation report. The assessee among other assets has
also recorded intangible assets at ₹ 12,83,82,923.00 and claimed depreciation
thereon at ₹ 1,60,47,865.00 only.
2.1 However, the AO during the assessment proceedings observed certain facts
as detailed under:
> i. There was no specific intangible asset acquired by the assessee from the
> company. As such, the seller company did not own any registered intellectual
> property rights.
> ii. There was no evidence available with the assessee regarding the
> acquisition of the technology by BBL from Cannon Shelly. As such the BBL has
> acquired machines and equipment from Cannon Shelly.
> iii. There was no mention in the valuation report about the acquisition of
> the technology by the assessee from BBL. Moreover, the valuation report was
> not obtained by the assessee from the approved valuer.
> iv. The valuer in his statement furnished under section 131 of the Act has
> also denied in question No. 19 that the assessee provided no detail for the
> acquisition of any patents, intellectual property rights, or similar rights.
> ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT
> Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
-5-
> v. The assessee was provided the opportunity for the cross-
> examination against the statement recorded under section 131 of the Act of
> the valuer but the assessee denied to avail the same.
2.2 In view of the above, the AO concluded that the assessee had not acquired
any technical know-how as claimed by it. Accordingly, in the absence of any
technical know-how, the assessee cannot claim the depreciation thereon. The AO
accordingly valued the block of technical know-how at nil. Thus the
depreciation claimed by the assessee for ₹ 1,60,47,865.00 on technical know-
how was denied and accordingly added to the total income of the assessee.
The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the learned CIT (A).
3\. The assessee before the learned CIT (A) submitted that it had acquired
technical know-how from BBL as evident from the clause 13.20.5 of schedule 1L
of the business transfer agreement.
3.1 The assessee also claimed that all the details for the acquisition of the
technical know-how were furnished before the AO during the assessment
proceedings.
3.2 The assessee also claimed that the valuation was done by the Government
approved valuer, and accordingly, the report furnished by him cannot be
rejected.

3.3 The learned CIT (A) after considering the submission of the assessee
observed that the assessee had acquired machines with the technologies which
were not valued by BBL separately in its books of accounts. But there was the
reference which has been mention in the business transfer agreement in the
clause 13.20.5 of schedule 1L as discussed above.
3.4 Accordingly, the learned CIT (A) worked out the value of the machines and
the technologies for the use of such machines separately by observing as
under:
> "(C).6 In the case of appellant as far as two technology "Back Foaming
> Technology" and "Gas Assist injection moulding" are concerned, the same were
> though held to be in built in this " Cannon Shelly power foam PF 2212
> machine" but acquired by M/s.BBL from M/s.Cannon Shelly in 1997 and M/s.BBL
> was reaping the monopoly of same technology at the time of transfer of
> automotive division. The same technology valued separately by appellant as
> "Technical KnowHow" though in the books of M/s.BBL no such separate
> technical KnowHow or IPR was mentioned. As per the ratio of case laws relied
> on by appellant, there can be much technical Know How or IPR in the bundle
> of "good will" if fixed assets are valued separately and intangible assets
> are valued separately. The specialized machine so acquired with such
> technique with qualified trained staff, such technology get transferred to
> appellant and can be valued separately. This left with the question now to
> be adjudicated that when such technology is part & parcel of any machine and
> such machine is valued separately and such technology valued separately then
> how the valuation of such machine is done i.e. whether such valuation is
> with such technique or such software, micro processor etc. or not? Another
> technical question which required consideration is whether such technical
> knowhow can be used independently or separately from such machines? It is in
> this regard, I am inclined with A.O. that as per statement of valuer, the
> process of valuation of "Technical knowhow" is based on the premium derived
> by appellant at Rs.102/- for ten years by using both machine as well as such
> techniques. The valuation of Technical knowhow is Rs.12,83,82,923/- but the
> same cannot be without use of such specialized machine and hence, the
> valuation of technical knowhow can only be attributed as total value of such
> technical knowhow reduced by value of bare machines. It is therefore the
> appropriate valuation of "technical knowhow" on account of acquisition of
> "cannon shelley machine" with such two specialized techniques can be of
> Rs.4,02,89,018/- only. The appellant claimed and granted depreciation on
> value of machine at Rs.88093905/-. The appellant did not claim depreciation
> on good will either of Rs.6,38 crores or Rs.53.24 crore as discussed above.
> It is therefore, the appellant can only be granted depreciation ITA

> on "Technical knowhow" of Rs.40289018/-, while the balance value out of
> total 'Technical Knowhow' of Rs.128383923/- i.e. Rs.88093905/- will go into
> "Good will". "
4\. Being aggrieved by the order of the learned CIT (A), both the assessee and
the Revenue are in appeal before us. The assessee is in appeal before us
against the confirmation of the disallowance of the depreciation in part
amounting to Rs. 1,10,11,738.00 whereas the Revenue is in an appeal against
the deletion of the disallowance of the depreciation amounting to Rs.
50,36,127.00 only.
The ground of appeal of the Revenue (in ITA No.2101/Ahd/2015 - AY 2008-09)
reads as under:
> (1) The Ld.CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the disallowance
> of depreciation on non-complete fee u/s.32(1)(ii) of the Act. (2) The ld.
> CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in partly deleting the disallowance of
> depreciation of know-how u/s.32(1)(ii) of the Act.
> On the fact and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the CIT(A)
> ought to have upheld the order of the Assessing Officer to the extent
> mentioned above since the assessee has failed to disclose his true
> income/book profit.
> The appellant prays that the order of CIT(A) on the above grounds be set
> aside and that of the Assessing Officer be restored to the above extent. The
> appellant craves, to leave, to amend or alter any ground or add a new ground
> which may be necessary.
5\. The learned AR before us filed a paper book running from pages 1 to 554
and submitted that as under:
> ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT
> Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
-8-
> The technical knowhow could not be rejected merely on the ground that no
> separate payment was made by the Assessee, since the fixed assets as well as
> the intangible assets were acquired by the Assessee, as a part of slump
> sale, by making a lump sum payment, and a separate valuation of the knowhow
> was carried out by the Assessee.
> The valuation report for the technical know-how was placed on record. The AO
> had failed to point out any technical error in the valuation report.
> The Assessing Officer also failed to place on record any other comparable
> valuation report so as to reject the valuation report submitted by the
> Assessee.
> The valuation methodology and procedure was explained by the valuer, Shri
> Paresh S.Shah which was not controverted by the AO.
> It is submitted that since it has already been held that the differential
> sum represents goodwill, depreciation is allowable on the same u/s.32 of the
> Act. We rely on CIT v. Smifs Securities Ltd. (2012) 348 ITR 302 (SC).
> Even if it is held that depreciation on the goodwill has not been claimed by
> the Assessee, the same shall be available as deduction u/s.32 in accordance
> with Explanation 5 to section 32 of the Act which states that depreciation
> is to be allowed to the Assessee whether or not it has been claimed while
> computing total income. Refer decision in the case of Rakesh Singh vs ACIT
> [2012] 139 ITD 128 (Bangalore), wherein it has been held that deduction of
> depreciation u/s.32 shall be available despite the same is not claimed by
> the Assessee in its return of income.
> Further, the additional claim of depreciation is to be allowed even where
> the same is not claimed in the return of income by the Assessee and is
> arising as a result of findings of the CIT(A).
> In the case of National Thermal Power Co. Ltd. [1998] 229 ITR 383, the Apex
> Court held that Tribunal had jurisdiction to examine a question of law which
> arose from the facts as found by the lower authorities and has bearing on
> the tax liability of the Assessee.
> Therefore, depreciation should be allowed to the Appellant on the total
> value of Goodwill as determined by the CIT(A).
6\. On the contrary, the learned DR before us submitted that the assessee had
not taken the plea before the authorities below that the amount of ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1)
Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.

technical know-how should be treated as goodwill in the event it is held that
there was no technical know-how acquired by it. Accordingly, the learned DR
before us pleaded that the matter should be restored to the file of the
learned CIT (A) for fresh adjudication.
7\. The learned AR in his rejoinder agreed to restore to the file of the
learned CIT(A) for fresh adjudication as per the provisions of law.
8\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. The issue in the instant case relates whether
the assessee has acquired any technical know-how from BBL or not. If there is
no acquisition of technical know-how, then there is no question of claiming
the depreciation on the technical know-how as discussed above.
8.1 From the preceding discussion, we note that the total consideration paid
by the assessee on the acquisition of the business of BBL as going concern on
slump sale basis has not been disputed by the authorities below. Thus it can
be inferred that the assessee is entitled to the deduction of the payment made
by it on the acquisition of the business of BBL as discussed above as per the
provisions of law. It is an undisputed fact that the assessee has made the
payment for ₹12.84 arose which is in dispute whether it represents the payment
towards technical know-how. In our considered view once the payment has been
admitted by the authorities below, then the assessee is entitled to the
deduction for the same by way of the depreciation either on the technical
know-how or the goodwill in the given facts & circumstances. But this aspect
has not been adjudicated by the learned CIT ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others
Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.

(A). Therefore in the interest of justice and fair play, we are restoring this
issue to the file of the learned CIT (A) for fresh adjudication as per the
provisions of law.
8.2 Similarly, we note that the ground of appeal raised by the Revenue is
inter-connected to the ground of appeal raised by the assessee as discussed
above. Therefore the issue raised by the Revenue also needs to be restored
back to the file of the learned CIT (A) for fresh adjudication as per the
provisions of law. Hence, the ground of appeal of the assessee and the revenue
are allowed for statistical purposes.
The 2nd issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 5 is that learned CIT (A)
erred in confirming the order of the AO by disallowing the deduction under
section 35D of the Act for Rs. 7,20,500.00 only.
9\. The assessee in the year under consideration has incurred certain expenses
as detailed under:
    Sr.No.      Particulars of expenses             Amount (in Rs)
    1           Fees paid for the incorporation of                 10,000

9.1 The assessee further claimed that such expenditures are eligible for
deduction under section 35D of the Act and accordingly claimed a 1/5th
deduction of such expenditure.
9.2 However, the AO was of the view that such expenditures are capital in
nature, and therefore, these are not eligible for deduction under section 35D
of the Act. Accordingly, the AO disallowed the same and added to the total
income of the assessee.
10\. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the learned CIT (A) who has
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> "I am inclined with A.O. that in view of specific expenditure as detailed by
> appellant and in view of ratio of Hon'ble Supreme Court order in the case of
> Brook Bond India and Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of M/s.Vareli

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned CIT (A), the assessee is in appeal
before us.
11\. The learned AR before us submitted as under:
> The Expenses incurred by the Appellant are in nature of Stamp duty payment

12\. On the other hand, the learned DR vehemently supported the order of the
authorities below.
13\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. The issue in the instant case relates whether
the assessee is entitled to claim the deduction of the expenditure incurred by
it in connection with the enhancement of the share capital under section 35D
of the Act.

At this juncture, we find it important to refer to the provisions of section
35D of the Act which reads as under:

13.2 The learned counsel did not press the issues raised in ground No. 6 and 7
by the assessee. Therefore, we dismiss the same as not pressed.
13.3 The issues raised in ground No. 8, 9 & 10 are consequential, the issue
raised in ground No. 11 is premature to decide and the issue raised in ground
No. 12 is general. Therefore we dismissed all of them as infructuous.
In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
Coming to the ITA 2101/AHD/2015 - AY 2008--09 The Revenue has raised the
following grounds of appeal:
> (1) The Ld.CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the disallowance
> of depreciation on non-complete fee u/s.32(1)(ii) of the Act.
> ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT

> aside and that of the Assessing Officer be restored to the above extent. The
> appellant craves, to leave, to amend or alter any ground or add a new ground
> which may be necessary.
The 1st issue raised by the Revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the disallowance made by the AO for the amount of rupees 62,50,000.00
on account of the depreciation on the non-compete fee paid by the assessee.
14\. The assessee in the year under consideration has paid a non-compete fee
to the promoters of BBL whereby it was agreed that the promoters of BBL would
not compete with the assessee in the business acquired by it for certain time
as per the agreement dated 6th September 2007. The assessee on the payment of
non-compete fee claimed the depreciation for ₹ 62,50,000 under section
32(1)(ii) of the Act treating the same as intangible assets.
14.1 However, the AO disallowed the claim of the depreciation by observing
that there is no provision under the Act for treating such non- compete fee
payment as intangible assets. Accordingly, the AO disallowed the same and
added to the total income of the assessee.

\- 16 -
15\. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the learned CIT (A) who has
deleted the addition made by the AO.
Being aggrieved by the order of the learned CIT (A) Revenue is in appeal
before us.
16\. Both the parties before us relied on the order of the authorities below
as favorable to them.
17\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. At the outset, we note that the Hon'ble Gujarat
High Court has settled the issue raised by the Revenue in the case of PCIT Vs.
Piramal Glass Limited in tax appeal no. 556 of 2017 wherein it was held as
under:
"2. We notice that before the Tribunal there was Cross Appeal filed by the
Revenue. From the Revenue's Appeal disposed of by the Tribunal, following two
additional questions are framed in this Appeal:
"(i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
ITAT was justified in deleting the ground raised by the revenue on write off
of non compete fees ofRs.18 Crores over a period of 18 years without
discussing the issue on merits ?
(ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law,
non-compete fee ofRs.18 Crores paid by the assessee can be written off in 18
years in a manner granted by the CIT(A) ? "
3\. Question No. (a) noted above pertains to the decision of the Tribunal to
grant depreciation on the Assessee's payment of non-compete fees. According to
the Revenue, this being an intangible asset, no depreciation under Section 32
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ('the Act' for short) was available.
ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT
Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
\- 17 -
4\. We however notice that similar issue has been considered by the different
High Courts and held in favour of the Assessee. A reference can be made to the
1 decision of the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the case of
Principal Commissioner of Income Tax v. Ferromatice Milacron India (P.)
Limited. It was also the case where the Assessee had incurred expenditure
pursuant to the non-compete agreement and claimed depreciation on such asset.
While dismissing the Revenue's Appeal against the Judgment of the Tribunal,
following observations were made:
"We may recall the Assessing Officer does not dispute that the expenditure was
capital in nature since by making such expenditure, the assessee had acquired
certain enduring benefits. He was, however, of the opinion that to claim
depreciation, the assessee must satisfy the requirement of Section 32(1)(ii)
of the Act, in which Explanation 3 provides that for the purpose of the said
sub-section the expression "assets" would mean ( as per clause (b) )
intangible assets, being known-how, patents, copyrights, trade marks,
licenses, franchises or any other business or commercial rights, of similar
nature. In the opinion of the Assessing Officer, the non-compete fee would not
satisfy this discrimination. Going by his opinion, no matter what the rights
acquired by the assessee through such non-compete agreement, the same would
never qualify for depreciation in section 32(l)(ii) of the Act as being
depreciable intangible asset. This view was plainly opposed to the well
settled principles. In case of Techno Shares & Stocks Limited (supra) the
Supreme Court held that payment for acquiring membership card of Bombay Stock
Exchange was intangible assets on which the depreciation can be claimed. It
was observed that the right of such membership included right of nomination as
a license which was one of the items which would fall under Section 32(1)(ii).
The right to participate in the market had an economic and money value. The
expenses incurred by the assessee which satisfied the test of being a license
or any other business or commercial right of similar nature In case of Areva T
& D India Limited (supra) Division Bench of Delhi High Court had an occasion
to interpret the meaning of intangible assets in context of section 32(l)(ii)
of the Act. It was observed that on perusal of the meaning of the categories
of specific intangible assets referred to in section 32(l)(ii) of the Act
preceding the term "business or commercial rights of similar nature" it is
seen that intangible assets are not of the same kind and are clearly distinct
from one another. The legislature thus did not intend to provide for
depreciation only in respect of the specified intangible assets but also to
other categories of intangible assets which may not be possible to
exhaustively enumerate. It was concluded that the assessee who had acquired
commercial rights to sell products under the trade name and through the
network created by the seller for sale in India were entitled to deprecation.
In the present case, Mr.Patel was erstwhile partner of the assessee. The
assessee had made payments to him to ward off competence and to protect its
existing business. Mr.Patel, in turn, had agreed not to solicit contract or
seek business from or to a person whose business relationship is with the
assessee. Mr. Patel would not solicit directly or indirectly any employee of
the assessee. He would not disclose any confidential information which would
include the past and current plan, operation of the existing business, trade
secretes lists etc. ITA No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd.
vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1) Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
\- 18 -
It can thus be seen that the rights acquired by the assessee under the said
agreement not only give enduring benefit, protected the assessee's business
against competence, that too from a person who had closely worked with the
assessee in the same business. The expression "or any other business or
commercial rights of similar nature" used in Explanation 3 to sub-section
32(1)(ii) is wide enough to include the present situation."
5\. No question of law in this respect therefore arises."
In view of the above, we hold that the assessee is entitled to the
depreciation on the payment of a non-compete fee to the party. Accordingly, we
do not find any reason to interfere in the order of the learned CIT (A). The
ground of appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
The 2nd issue raised by the revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the disallowance of the depreciation in part made by the AO for Rs.
50,36,127.00 on the technical know-how.
18\. At the outset, we note that the issue raised by the Revenue has already
been adjudicated along with the ground of appeal raised by the assessee in ITA
No. 1990/Ahd/2015 vide Para number 8 of this order. For the detailed
discussion, please refer to the relevant paragraph. Accordingly, we allow the
ground of appeal raised by the Revenue for statistical purposes.
In the result, the appeal of the Revenue in ITA No.2101/Ahd/2015 for AY
2008-09 is partly allowed for statistical purposes.

The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:
All the grounds of appeal in this appeal are mutually exclusive and without
prejudice to each other.

thereby making addition of Rs.1,92,70,542/- to the income of the Appellant.

The 1st issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 1 to 4 is that the learned
CIT (A) erred in restricting the addition of the depreciation whereas the
assessee is entitled to the full depreciation on the technical know-how.
27\. At the outset, we note that the issues raised by the assessee in ground
nos. 1 to 4 are identical to the issues raised by the assessee in ITA No.
1990/AHD/2015 which we have restored to the file of the learned CIT (A) for
the fresh adjudication as per the provisions of law vide Para number 8 of this
order. For the detailed discussion, please refer to the relevant paragraph.
Accordingly, we allow the ground of appeal raised by the assessee for the
statistical purposes.

The 2nd issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 5 is that learned CIT (A)
erred in confirming the order of the AO by disallowing the deduction under
section 35D of the Act for Rs. 7,20,500.00 only.
28\. At the outset, we note that the issue raised by the assessee in ground 5
is identical to the issues raised by the assessee in ITA No. 1990/AHD/2015
which we have allowed in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue vide
Para number 10 of this order. For the detailed discussion, please refer to the
relevant paragraph. Accordingly, we allow the ground of appeal raised by the
assessee.
The 3rd issue raised by the assessee in ground No. 6 is that the learned CIT
(A) erred in upholding the disallowance of ₹ 14,67,120.00 on account of late
deposit of the PF and ESIC.
29\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. In the instant case, the assessee has delayed
in making the payment of employee's contribution of PF/ ESI as specified under
the relevant Act. Therefore, the disallowance was made by the AO u/s 36(1)(va)
r.w.s. 2(24)(x) of the Act. The Ld. CIT-A subsequently confirmed the view
taken by the AO. The Ld. AR before us has not challenged the proposition laid
down by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of CIT Vs. GSRTC reported
in 366 ITR 170, wherein it was held as under:
> "In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, and considering
> section 36(1)(va) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 read with sub-clause (x) of
> clause 24 of section 2, it is held that with respect to the sum received by

> credited by the assessee to the employees' account in the relevant fund or
> funds on or before the "due date" mentioned in explanation to section
> 36(1)(va).Consequently, it is held that the learned tribunal has erred in
> deleting respective disallowances being employees' contribution to PF
> Account / ESI Account made by the AO as, as such, such sums were not
> credited by the respective assessee to the employees' accounts in the
> relevant fund or funds (in the present case Provident Fund and/or ESI Fund

> Act i.e. date by which the concerned assessee was required as an employer to
> credit employees' contribution to the employees' account in the Provident
> Fund under the Provident Fund Act and/or in the ESI Fund under the ESI Act."
30\. However, the Ld. AR before us has submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has admitted the SLP against the order of the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court
as discussed above. Accordingly, the ld. AR before us prayed to restore the
matter before the AO with the direction to wait until the verdict of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and apply the same to the case on hand.
30.1 However, we note that impugned is covered against the assessee by the
judgment of the Hon'ble High Court as discussed above. The ld. AR has also not
moved an application under the provisions of section 158A of the Act to avoid
the repetitive appeals. Therefore, we are not inclined to entertain the plea
of the ld. AR for the assessee. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is
dismissed.
In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.

Coming to ITA No. 2168/AHD/2015 for the AY 2011-12 The Revenue has raised the
following grounds of appeal:
(1) The Ld.CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the disallowance
of depreciation on non-complete fee u/s.32(1)(ii) of the Act. (2) The ld.
CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in partly deleting the disallowance of
depreciation of know-how u/s.32(1)(ii) of the Act. (3) The ld.CIT(A) has erred
in law and on facts in deleting the addition made of Rs.13,26,163/- on account
of unutilized CENVAT Credit u/s45A of the Act.
On the fact and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the CIT(A) ought
to have upheld the order of the Assessing Officer to the extent mentioned
above since the assessee has failed to disclose his true income/book profit.
The appellant prays that the order of CIT(A) on the above grounds be set aside
and that of the Assessing Officer be restored to the above extent. The
appellant craves, to leave, to amend or alter any ground or add a new ground
which may be necessary.
The 1st issue raised by the Revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the disallowance made by the AO on account of the depreciation on the
non-compete fee paid by the assessee.
31\. At the outset, we note that the issue raised by the Revenue in ground no.
1 is identical to the issue raised by it in ITA No. 2101/AHD/2015 which we
have decided against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee vide Para
number 14 of this order. For the detailed discussion, please refer to the
relevant paragraph. Accordingly, we dismiss the ground of appeal raised by the
Revenue.

The 2nd issue raised by the revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the disallowance of the depreciation in part made by the AO on the
technical know-how.
32\. At the outset, we note that the identical issue raised by the Revenue has
already been adjudicated along with the ground of appeal raised by the
assessee in ITA No. 1990/AHD/2015 vide Para number 8 of this order. For the
detailed discussion, please refer to the relevant paragraph. Accordingly, we
allow the ground of appeal raised by the Revenue for statistical purposes.
The 3rd issue raised by the Revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the addition made by the AO for Rs. 13,26,163/- on account of
unutilized CENVAT credit u/s 145A of the Act.
33\. The assessee during the assessment proceedings claimed that it has been
following the exclusive method of accounting. Therefore, the opening stock,
purchases, sales, and closing stock of the goods were recorded in the books of
accounts without including the amount of CENVAT/VAT.
33.1 However, the Assessing Officer observed that it is mandatory to value the
closing stock as per the provisions of section 145A of the Act, i.e. after
including the element of the taxes. Accordingly, the Assessing Officer found
that there was a closing balance of CENVAT as on 31/03/2011 for Rs.
13,26,163/- only which needs to be included in the closing stock of the goods.
Hence, the Assessing Officer was of the view that the assessee has ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1)
Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
\- 32 -
undervalued its closing stock by the amount of Rs. 13,26,163/- and
accordingly, the same was added to the total income of the assessee.
34\. The aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld. CIT(A) who has
deleted the addition made by the Assessing Officer by observing that the
entire exercise to include the CENVAT credit to the closing stock is tax
neutral.
Being aggrieved by the order of Ld. CIT(A), the Revenue is in appeal before
us.
35\. Both the parties before us relied on the orders of the authorities below
as favorable to them.
36\. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the materials available
on record. The allegation of the Assessing Officer in the instant case is that
the assessee while valuing the closing stock of its goods as on 31/03/2011 has
not included the amount of CENVAT which is contrary to the provisions of
section 145A of the Act. Therefore, the closing stock of the assessee was
enhanced by the amount of CENVAT credit of Rs.13,26,163/- as attributable to
the closing stock of the assessee.
36.1 However, the Ld. CIT(A) deleted the addition made by the Assessing
Officer by observing that the assessee has been following its method of
valuation consistently and there was no dissatisfaction of the Assessing ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1)
Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.
\- 33 -
Officer about the correctness/completeness of the books of accounts of the
assessee.
36.2 From the preceding discussion, we note that the assessee has been
recording its transactions of purchase, sales, and valuation of inventories,
net of CENVAT consistently. Thus, if the inventory of closing stock is
enhanced by the amount of CENVAT credit attributable to it, then the amount of
corresponding purchases should also be increased by the said amount which will
result in tax neutral exercise. Thus, in our considered view, the Assessing
Officer erred in enhancing the value of the closing stock without giving
effect to the purchases. In this regard, we find support and guidance from the
judgment of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Pr.CIT vs. Gujarat Gas
Company Ltd. In Tax Appeal No.90 of 2017 vide order dated 07/02/2017, wherein
it was held as under:-
> "3.03. Now, so far as question No. [B] i.e. with respect to addition made by
> the A.O. on account of unutilized modvat/cenvat credit of Rs. 56,08,089/- is
> connected, it is required to be noted that the learned tribunal has taken
> note that with respect to modvat receivable account, there is corresponding
> less debit to the purchase account and hence to that extent there is already
> income offered for tax. If that be so, there was no question of further
> adding modvat/cenvat credit to the income of the assessee for the year under
> consideration. Under the circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with
> the impugned judgement and order passed by the learned tribunal so far as
> confirming the order passed by the learned CIT(A) deleting the addition made
> by the A.O. on account of unutilised modvat/cenvat credit of Rs.
> 56,08,089/-. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned
> tribunal."
36.3 There is no ambiguity that the assessee has been following the exclusive
method of accounting. In view of the above, we concur with the ITA
No.1990/Ahd/2015 & ten others Bright Autoplast Ltd. vs. ACIT Circle-1(1)(1)
Asst.Year - 2008-09 & Ors.

view of the Ld. CIT(A) and accordingly decline to interfere in his order.
Hence, the ground of appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.

the detailed discussion, please refer to the relevant paragraph. Accordingly,
we allow the ground of appeal raised by the Revenue for statistical purposes.
The 3rd issue raised by the Revenue is that the learned CIT (A) erred in
deleting the addition made by the AO for Rs. 7,05,000.00 on account
capitalization of interest under section 36(1)(iii) of the Act.
45\. The assessee in the year under consideration claimed to have capitalized
an amount of Interest Expenses for ₹682.84 lakhs in respect of capital work in
progress. However, the AO was of the view that the assessee was required to
capitalize the interest on the capital work in progress amounting to ₹689.89
lakhs only. As such the assessee has capitalized short amount of interest
expenses by ₹7.05 lakhs. On a question by the AO, the assessee failed to
produce the supporting evidence. Therefore the AO disallowed the amount of
₹7.05 lakhs by holding the same as capital in nature and added to the total
income of the assessee.
The aggrieved assessee preferred appeal to the learned CIT (A).
46\. The assessee before the learned CIT (A) submitted that it had furnished
the requisite details of the capital work in progress and the amount of
interest which was capitalized therein. The auditor of the company duly
verified such amount of capital work-in-progress and the interest expenses.
46.1 The AO without pointing out any specific defect in the working of the
assessee regarding the capital work in progress and the interest expenses has

46.3 The learned CIT (A) deleted the addition made by the AO by observing that
the AO made a similar disallowance in the assessment year 2012-13, which was
deleted by the learned CIT-A. Accordingly, the learned CIT (A) also deleted
the addition made by the AO for the year under consideration.
Being aggrieved by the order of the learned CIT (A), the Revenue is in appeal
before us.
47\. Both the parties before us vehemently supported the order of the

preferred by the Revenue in respect of the deletion made by the learned CIT
(A) for the year pertaining to the assessment year 2012-13. Therefore, we hold
that the order of the learned CIT (A) has reached its finality for the
assessment year 2012-13.
48.1 Similarly, we also note that the assessee has furnished the necessary
details of the capital work in progress and the amount of interest capitalized
therein. But the learned DR before us has not brought any iota of evidence
contrary to the finding of the learned CIT-A. Hence we do not find a reason to
interfere in the order of the learned ITA. Hence the ground of appeal of the
revenue is dismissed.
In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
