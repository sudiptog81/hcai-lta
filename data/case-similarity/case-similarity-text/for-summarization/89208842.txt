        JUDGMENT
1\. By the above reports, the Official Liquidator is seeking a declaration
that a Deed of Assignment dated 14.03.2012 executed by Mr. Shashi Gopal, an
ex-
director of Magnasound India Ltd. ("MSIL"), the Company (In Liqn.), in favour
of one Magnasound Media Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter "MMPL") is illegal and void.
The Official Liquidator is also seeking other consequential directions
including, inter-alia, a direction to MMPL and Sony Music Entertainment Pvt.
Ltd. (hereinafter "Sony Music") to hand over the documents and assets which
were the subject matter of the purported Deed of Assignment and also for
directions to restrain MMPL and Sony Music from dealing with these assets.
2\. It is the Official Liquidator's case that Shashi Gopal, in purported
exercise of his rights as a Subrogee, has after the winding up order sold
assets belonging to the Company (In Liqn.) without the leave of this Court,
without valuation and without inviting public offers to a related party at a
price randomly fixed by the Assignor (Mr. Shashi Gopal) and the Assignee
(MMPL).
It is submitted on this basis that the Assignment is void as contrary to
Sections 536(2) and 537(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 1956.

3\. The Company in liquidation had sometime in the late 1990s, availed of
certain facilities from Union Bank of India (hereinafter "UBI"). In this
connection, the Company had executed Three Deeds of Hypothecation dated
12.8.1998, 30.7.1999 and 28.7.2000 in favour of UBI in respect of the
copyright in recordings containing the original music compositions rendered by
various artistes and which were owned by the Company. Each of the Deeds of
Hypothecation contained a clause which permitted the Lender, in the event of
the borrower committing default, to "sell all or any part of the hypothecated
sound recording copyrights in such manner as the bank shall think fit, but by
giving 15 days notice to the borrower and either by public auction, private
Contract or tender..."
4\. On 16.7.2002, the above Company Petition came to be filed by the
Petitioner Asha Bhosle for winding up the company on account of its failure to
discharge its payment obligations to the Petitioner. On 30.4.2003, the OL,
High Court, Bombay came to be appointed as the Provisional Liquidator of the
Company. Meanwhile, the Company also appears to have been in default of its
obligations to UBI as a result of which UBI filed OA No.186 of 2004 before the
DRT, Mumbai for recovery of their dues and enforcement of their securities

KPPNair 4 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 including under the aforementioned
deeds of Hypothecation.
5\. On 23.4.2007, an order was passed by the DRT in terms of a compromise Memo
filed by UBI and the guarantors of the Company in Liquidation. The compromise
memo provided that the guarantors would submit to a decree on admission in a
sum of Rs. 8,56,33,265/- in favour of UBI. The said memo also recorded an OTS
offer that had been accepted by the Bank for payment of a sum of Rs. 520.06
lacs before September, 2006 by the Guarantors on which the claim of the Bank
was to stand fully satisfied. The compromise memo further recorded that the
guarantors were in a position only to pay Rs. 281.02 lacs and not the entire
OTS amount. The guarantors were given an opportunity by the compromise memo to
revive the lapsed OTS for a further period of one year on certain terms and
conditions recorded in the compromise memo. The balance OTS amount of
Rs.239.04 lacs was to be paid, inter alia, by the sale of the "Masters"
belonging to the Company in Liquidation "after taking possession from the
Official Liquidator and obtaining permission from the DRT". The Masters were
to be brought to sale through DRT, with the Guarantors to arrange for buyers
at a minimum price of Rs. 150 lakhs. In the event of there being a surplus
over and above Rs. 150 Lakhs, the surplus was to go to the bank, while any
shortfall was to be made good by the Guarantors.

KPPNair 5 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14
6\. The Compromise Decree does not seem to have been fully complied with as a
result of which the Debt Recovery Tribunal directed issuance of a Recovery
Certificate on 21.1.2008 for the balance amount of Rs. 212 lacs which remained
unpaid. The Recovery Certificate in the sum of Rs.212 lacs was thereafter
issued on 30.4.2008.
7\. On 15.5.2008, Shashi Gopal (an Ex Director of the Company in Liquidation
and a guarantor) filed a Misc. Application before the DRT, inter alia, for
purchase of the assets of the Company in Liquidation. The OL filed a reply
dated 27.5.2008 in this Misc. Application where he noted that the assets may
be sold by" public auction" only in one lot after publication of necessary
sale notice and not by way of private treaty at any cost. On 20.6.2008, the
said Shashi Gopal filed an application for withdrawal of his Misc.
Application. The Misc. Application was thereafter disposed of as withdrawn.
8\. Meanwhile, on 24.3.2009, the DRT issued a Warrant of Attachment in respect
of the hypothecated assets of the Company in Liquidation. Thereafter, Mr.
Shashi Gopal appears to have entered into a bargain with UBI for payment  :::
Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54 ::: KPPNair 6
CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 of the balance dues of the bank. Accordingly,
Shashi Gopal paid over to UBI the sum of Rs. 212 lakhs then outstanding. On
this payment being made, a Deed of Subrogation dated 25.6.2009 was executed
between UBI and Shashi Gopal under which the Bank purported to subrogate to
Shashi Gopal "complete rights of Bank against MSIL in recovery of debt due
under Consent Decree dated 23.4.2007 including enforcement and realization of
mortgaged and hypothecated properties". The Deed of Subrogation also recorded,
as it happens inaccurately, that "there appears to be no workers' claims
lodged before the Official Liquidator and hence there is no pari passu charge
in respect of the assets of the MSIL mentioned in the consent terms".
9\. On the same day, UBI served upon the OL an application for leave to
withdraw the recovery proceedings pending before the DRT. By his report dated
26.6.2009, the OL recorded that he had no objection if leave was granted to
withdraw the recovery proceedings. The said proceedings were accordingly
withdrawn.
10\. Thereafter, by a letter dated 28.7.2009, UBI informed the OL of the Deed
of Subrogation executed in favour of Shashi Gopal. The letter also  :::
Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54 ::: KPPNair 7
CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 recorded that the Bank had handed over
possession of a Bungalow at Lonavala, one of the secured assets, alongwith the
hypothecated assets lying therein. The letter also recorded that the Bank did
not have any other claim with respect to the assets of the Company in
Liquidation. In July 2009, Shashi Gopal filed a Misc. Application no.632 of
2009 before the DRT seeking a direction to the OL to hand over the
"Masters/Artists Agreements/Stocks and other assets of the Defendant No.1
Company (now in Prov. Liqn) lying in various branches and which are
hypothecated to the Applicant Bank." By his written submissions dated
4.8.2009, the OL recorded that he had no objection "if the properties in the
custody of UBI , the secured creditor, are handed over to Mr. Shashi Gopal and
kept under his custody" . Accordingly, an order came to be passed by the DRAT
on 5.8.2009 directing that the hypothecated assets be handed over to Mr.
Shashi Gopal. Pursuant to the said order, these assets were handed over to Mr.
Shashi Gopal as recorded in two minutes dated 17.12.2009 and 18.1.2010.
11\. Meanwhile, by a letter dated 6.1.2010 addressed to the OL, Mr. Shashi
Gopal in his capacity as a subrogee claimed that "all royalties if any payable
by music societies, Phonographic performance Ltd (PPL) and Indian Performing
Rights Society LTD (IPRS) are payable to me from 1996 onwards in respect of
the use of  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015
00:00:54 ::: KPPNair 8 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 Masters of Magnasound
India Ltd if they have not already been paid." By this letter, Mr. Shashi
Gopal sought a no objection letter from the OL in this regard.
By his reply dated 21.1.2010, the OL fixed a meeting on 25.1.2010 to discuss
Mr. Shashi Gopal's role as a Subrogee and the issue regarding the collection
of any royalties payable, towards the use of the Masters of the Company in
Liquidation. By this letter, the Subrogee was expressly told to "maintain
status quo". Mr. Shashi Gopal did not attend the meeting so fixed.
12\. Consequently, the OL addressed another letter dated 28.1.2010 fixing a
meeting on 9.2.2010. On 10.2.2010 the said Mr. Shashi Gopal addressed a letter
to the OL noting that he wished to withdraw his letter dated 6.1.2010 along
with a request that no meeting be fixed in this regard. On 9.7.2010, a winding
up order was passed in respect of the Company in Liquidation. It is the case
of Mr. Shashi Gopal that a letter dated 9.5.2011 was addressed by him to the
OL in which he informed the OL that he would sell/assign all the copyrights in
the sound recordings in the music/literary works and master and "all the
rights in audio, video and cinematograph films owned by the Company to recover
the monies paid by me to the UBI on account of the Company together with
interest thereon at 18% p.a with monthly rests." It appears from the Inward
::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54 :::
KPPNair 9 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 Register maintained by the OL that
the said letter dated 9.5.2011 was received by the office of the OL on
10.5.2011. It appears, however, that the said letter was overlooked by the
Office of the Official Liquidator on account of it not having been placed in
the file pertaining to the Company in Liquidation and not having been put up
before the Deputy OL or OL for necessary action. The OL asserts that it is in
these circumstances that no reply was sent to the said letter.
13\. On 21.5.2011, a public notice was issued by one MMPL Pvt Ltd in the Free
Press Journal and Navshakti in respect of its intention to acquire the entire
copyright in the repertoire of the Company in Liquidation. The said notice did
not come to the attention of the OL. Thereafter, a Deed of Assignment dated
14.3.2012 appears to have been entered into by the said Mr. Shashi Gopal and
MMPL, a related party, transferring the entire repertoire of the Company in
Liquidation. MMPL in turn appears immediately thereafter to have negotiated
with Sony Music Entertainment Private Limited (Sony Music) for a license to be
granted in favour of Sony in respect of a part of the repertoire of the
Company in Liquidation. The Notices issued by Sony Music appear to have come
to the attention of the Petitioner hereinabove who by a letter dated 13.4.2012
called upon the OL to file an objection in response to the aforesaid  :::
Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54 ::: KPPNair
10 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 notice.
14\. The OL, by a letter dated 20.4.2012 addressed to Sony Music recorded that
the assets of the Company in Liquidation vested in him and that any rights in
its repertoire could not be transferred or assigned without the permission of
this Court. The OL also sought a copy of the documents on the basis of which
the public notice had been issued. A meeting was thereafter held on 24.4.2012
in the office of the Deputy OL at which the representatives of Sony Music also
remained present. At this meeting, these representatives undertook "not to
deal with the proposed acquisition/ licence in respect of the assets mentioned
in the public notice dated 11.4.2012".
15\. This was followed, however, by an Advocates' letter dated 2.5.2012 where
Sony Music purported to claim that it was "satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that the title of MMPL with respect to the assets mentioned in the public
notice including the repertoire is free, clear and marketable as well as free
from all encumbrances." The letter went on to assert that the Company in
Liquidation was not the owner of the said repertoire and that the undertaking
given by the representatives of Sony Music at the meeting held on 24.4.2012
was "wrongly  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015
00:00:54 ::: KPPNair 11 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 taken and therefore
stood withdrawn". By his reply dated 14.5.2012, the OL recorded that the
attempt being made by Sony Music to withdraw their undertaking was ill
conceived and called upon them to maintain status quo until the rights, if
any, of MMPL in the catalogue/repertoire of the Company in Liquidation was
ascertained.
16\. By their Advocates' reply dated 6.6.2012, Sony Music claimed that UBI had
disposed of the repertoire with the prior consent of the OL as recorded in an
order of the DRAT and that in view of the entire repertoire being disposed of
with prior consent as alleged, the Company in Liquidation was not the owner of
the said Repertoire. The letter further claimed that the OL had travelled
beyond his jurisdiction in taking an undertaking from Sony Music in relation
to the said Repertoire and that the undertaking was invalid and bad in law.
The letter also recorded that Sony Music had already entered into an agreement
with MMPL under which Sony Music had been granted an exclusive license for the
said Repertoire. By this letter however, Sony Music did not furnish to the OL
copies of the agreements executed by them.
17\. It is only in the course of the hearing of the above report that Sony
Music  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54
::: KPPNair 12 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 furnished to the OL four
agreements, being an exclusive license agreement dated 7.5.2012, an exclusive
license agreement dated 15.6.2012, a Memorandum of Agreement dated 7.11.2012
and an addendum dated 5.3.2015.
Under these agreements (which purport to create a license in respect of a part
of the repertoire of the company in liquidation for a limited period) MMPL is
entitled to payment of an aggregate minimum guaranteed amount of Rs.1.75
crores in addition to a share in revenue overflow. No material has been placed
on record by Sony Music regarding the revenue generated by them under the said
Agreements. It is significant, however that Sony Music entered into the said
Agreements with full notice of the OL's claim.
18\. On 18.7.2012, the Petitioner in the above company Petition filed Company
Application No, 498 of 2012, inter alia, impugning the purported transfer by
Shashi Gopal of the hypothecated assets in favour of MMPL.
Subsequently, however, the Petitioner having reached a settlement with Shashi
Gopal sought leave to withdraw the Company Application. This leave was granted
by an order dated 12.6.2014. By this order, the OL was permitted to take out
an independent application to challenge the legality of the purported
transfer. It is in these circumstances that the present report under  :::
Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:54 ::: KPPNair
13 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 consideration came to be filed.
19\. In the course of his oral submissions, Mr. Sen, learned Senior Advocate
on behalf of the Official Liquidator, contended:
> a) That while it has been contended on behalf of Mr. Shashi Gopal that he is
> entitled to the benefit of the Compromise Memo filed before the DRT, he
> cannot as a matter of law be so entitled. Any reference in the Deed of
> Subrogation to his being so entitled is clearly of no legal effect. This is
> on account of the fact that a Bank cannot assign its debt to a non banking
> entity nor can it assign a recovery certificate or the benefit of a consent
> decree to such an entity. In this behalf, he relied on the Judgment of the
> Hon'ble Supreme Court in ICICI Bank Ltd. v. Official Liquidator for APS Star
> Industries Ltd.1 ;
b) That in the present case, UBI does not appear to have done so. It has not
assigned its debt, decretal or otherwise, to Mr. Shashi Gopal but has merely
transferred in his favour the benefit of the securities held by them on
account of his being a subrogee. This is a benefit to which Mr. Shashi Gopal
would have been even 1 (2010) 10 SCC 1 (paras 29, 30 to 40 and 41 to 44).

KPPNair 14 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 otherwise entitled by operation of
law on payment being made by him in his capacity as a guarantor of amounts due
from the principal debtor to the secured creditor;
c) That Shashi Gopal is thus merely a Subrogee in respect of the amounts paid
by him to UBI. He is in that capacity entitled to the benefit of any security
that the bank held for recovery of the money paid by him. The principal debtor
being a Company in liquidation, Mr Shashi Gopal is entitled as a subrogee only
to the sum actually paid by him and not to any interest on the said amount
unless there is an overflow after payment to all creditors.
This is on account of the fact that the dues of the secured creditors and
workers have to be determined as far as possible as on the date of the winding
up order. He relied in this connection on the Judgment of this Court in
Vishwanath Namdeo Patil v. Official Liquidator of Swadeshi Mills & Ors.2, and
the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bank of Maharashtra v. Pandurang
Keshav Gorwadkar 3;.
d) That the Deeds of Hypothecation in the present case contain a power of
sale. However, the Company being in liquidation, the 2 (2013) 181 Com. Cas.

a/w OLR NO. 188/14 power of sale is qualified by the pari passu charge of the
workmen under Section 529-A. The Subrogee can therefore sell only in
association with the OL. The earlier law that a secured creditor would be free
to deal with his security without reference to the Official Liquidator is no
longer good law. He relied in this behalf on the Judgments of this Court and
of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Maharashtra State Financial Corporation v.
Official Liquidator4;
International Coach Builders Ltd. v. Karnataka State Financial Corporation5;
Rajasthan State Financial Corporation v. Official Liquidator6; Bank of
Maharashtra v. Pandurang Keshav Gorwadkar7;
Kingfisher Airlines v. SBI8;
e) That the secured creditor cannot arrogate to himself the power to decide
whether there are any workers' claims. If workers' claims have not yet been
adjudicated, he must apply to the company court seeking directions for sale;
That the fact that the OL has not objected to the subrogation in
f) favour of Shashi Gopal does not constitute an admission of 4 AIR 1993 Bom

in the Deed of Subrogation particularly an incorrect recital that no workers'
claims have been received. The OL has no obligation to object to such a
recital and the absence of such an objection cannot, in any event, constitute
a rejection of workers' claims which have in fact been made. That being so,
the subrogee was not entitled to sell the hypothecated assets by private
treaty without reference to the Company Court;
g) That even otherwise, a hypothecatee or pledgee is in a fiduciary position
and is obligated to sell a security in such a manner as would fetch the best
possible price. In support of this proposition, he relied on the Judgments of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Lallan Prasad v. Rahmat Ali & Anr.9; Jaya Singh
Dnyanu Mhoprekar & Anr. v. Krishna Babaji Patil & Anr.10;
h) That the law requires him to adopt every precaution in this respect
including obtaining a valuation and selling the property by public notice. In
this connection, he placed reliance on the Judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court

j) That any sale of the assets of a company in liquidation after the
commencement of liquidation is void under Sections 536(2) and 537(1)(b) of the
Companies Act, whether by the company itself or a third party. None of the
Judgments cited by the subrogee raise the issue as to whether a sale by a
third party would fall within the ambit of these sections. The plain language
of the section would indicate that they would. That is certainly within the
mischief sought to be remedied by the Sections;
k) That the sale in the present case of the hypothecated assets (without a
valuation, a public auction or the leave of the company court) by private
treaty at a price randomly fixed to a related party is liable to be set aside;

20\. Dr. Tulzapurkar, Learned Senior Advocate for MMPL, submitted in reply:
a) That Section 536(2) of the Companies Act has no application to the sale by
a third party of the assets of the company in liquidation and applies only to

21\. Mr. Chetan Kapadia, Learned Counsel on behalf of Shashi Gopal, while
adopting the arguments of Dr. Tulzapurkar, also contended, by way of written
submissions, that the condition of the master tapes and the cassette/CD photo
covers which were originally handed over to the Official Liquidator in good
condition, were received by the subrogee in a poor condition. He further
contended that the subrogee was therefore obliged to spend considerable time
and money to restore the master tapes and photo cards to render them usable.
He further contended that in any event, even if the hypothecated securities
were capable of fetching more than Rs. 1.5 crores and had been sold by UBI
under the consent decree in its favour, such overflow would have enured to the
benefit only of UBI and not the workmen.
22\. Mr. Amit Jamsandekar, Learned Counsel for Sony Music, submitted that his
client had bonafide acquired rights from MMPL. He further urged that after
acquisition of the rights, Sony Music had invested "tremendous amount of
money, skills, labour and resources to commercially exploit the copyright"
acquired by them. On this basis, he contends that it would be inequitable to
set aside the Agreements executed by MMPL in their favour.

Thereafter Advocates for the parties except Sony Music Entertainment India

Sony Music Entertainment India filed its written submissions on 11 th June,
2015\. I have considered the oral as well as written submissions made/filed by
the parties and the Judgments relied upon by them. The first issue that arises
for consideration is as to whether Shashi Gopal, in his capacity as a
subrogee, was entitled to sell any of the hypothecated securities without the
leave of the Company Court. The contention advanced on behalf of the Official
Liquidator that a recovery certificate issued by the Debt Recovery Tribunal or
the benefit of a Consent Decree passed by it is incapable of assignment to a
non banking entity reflects the true legal position. A non banking entity is
not entitled under the provisions of the Recovery of Debts Act to file an
Original Application in the Debt Recovery Tribunal for recovery of any amounts
due to it. It follows that it would not be entitled to seek enforcement of a
Recovery Certificate issued by the Debt Recovery Tribunal in favour of a bank
or financial institution on the purported basis that the same has been
assigned to it. Such an assignment appears to be legally impermissible.

24\. In any event, in the present case, on a fair reading of the Deed of
Subrogation dated 25.06.09, UBI does not appear to have assigned its debt,
decretal or otherwise, to Mr. Shashi Gopal but has merely transferred in his
favour the benefit of the securities held on account of his being a subrogee.
This is a benefit to which Mr. Shashi Gopal would have been even otherwise
entitled by operation of law on payment being made by him in his capacity as a
guarantor of amounts due from the principal debtor to the secured creditor.
That being so, Mr. Shashi Gopal can rely if at all only on the terms of the
Deeds of Hypothecation that had been executed by the Company in Liquidation in
favour of UBI. The Deeds of Hypothecation in the present case do contain a
power of sale. However, the Company being in Liqn, the power of sale is
qualified by the pari passu charge of the Workmen under Section 529-A of the
Companies Act, 1956. The principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
MK Ranganathan v. Govt. of Madras (supra) that a secured creditor is entitled
to stand outside the winding up and enforce his security by sale without
reference to the OL or the Company Court pre-dated the introduction of Section
529A which places workers on par with secured creditors and is no longer good
law. This position has been recognized in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in International Coach Builders (supra) and several  ::: Uploaded on -

19\. The decision of the Bombay High Court in Maharashtra State  ::: Uploaded
on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 ::: KPPNair 28 CP
719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 Financial Corporation case (supra) gives weighty
reasons as to why when the company is under winding up the SFC to which the
assets of the company are charged cannot proceed to realise the security
without intervention of the Company Court. We have already noticed that as a
result of the amendment to Section 529 a pari passu charge to the extent of
the workmen's portion is created on the security of every secured creditor
when he opts to realize a security by standing outside winding up. 'Pari
Passu' means "with equal steps, equally, without preference"
(Jowitt's Dictionary, Vol.II, 1959 Edition 1294). Black's Law Dictionary, 6th
Edition, 115 defines it as "By an equal progress... Used especially of
creditors who, in marshalling assets, are entitled to receive out of the same
fund without any precedence over each other." It is also defined as "With
equal steps, that is to say, proceeding side by side at the same place"
(Prem's Judicial Dictionary, Volume III, 1964 Edition, page 1217)
20\. The rights of the pari passu charge holders would run equally, temporally
and potently, with the rights of the secured creditors.
22\. Since the Official Liquidator is in the position of a co-mortgage, the
SFCs cannot act independently or by ignoring him for enforcing the security.
It is established law that in case of co-mortgages, all of them should join in
the suit for enforcing the security, but if some of them refuse to join, they
have to be included as defendants, not merely as performa parties, but as
necessary parties inasmuch as the mortgage right vests in them along with the
plaintiffs-mortgagees. (See in this connection the judgment of the Privy
Council in Sunitibala  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on -
22/10/2015 00:00:55 ::: KPPNair 29 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 Debi
v.Dharae Sundari Debi AIR 1919 PC 24. The same principle would be
substantially true and applicable in the case of a mortgagee and a pari passu
charge-holder over the same security for realising the security. The
realization of the security can only be done by both the charge-holders
joining and realising the security simultaneously. If a sale takes place, it
can only be simultaneously for recovery of the claim of all pari passu charge-
holders and sale proceeds are required to be divided proportionately in the
same proportion as their dues.
23\. In support of their respective contentions, parties have referred to and
relied upon judgments of different High Courts. The view taken by the Bombay
High Court commends itself to us. The Division Bench of the said High Court
pointed out that, like a secured creditor, the official liquidator as a pari
passu charge holder cannot independently bring the security to sale ignoring
the secured creditor. He must, therefore, either obtain concurrence of the
secured creditor for sale and take the Court's sanction, or he can apply for
sanction of the Court after notice to the secured creditor. In either event,
the Court while granting sanction may impose appropriate condition and give
directions regarding the conduct of the sale, the fixing of the reserve bid,
acceptance of the bid, confirmation of sale and distribution of sale proceeds.
24\. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that every creditor is interested in
realizing the security only for his benefit and to the extent necessary for
recovery of his outstanding. Prior to 1985 it might have been possible for a
secured creditor under Section 529 of the Companies Act, 1956, or its
predecessor, Section 232 of the Companies Act, 1913 as interpreted by  :::
Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 ::: KPPNair
30 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 this Court in M.K. Ranganathan case (supra),
to opt to stand outside the winding up and realise the security by bringing it
to sale. This was possible because the secured creditor had unrestricted right
of standing outside the winding up and proceeding against the property
mortgaged to him.
25\. Of course, even in such a situation, if the same property was mortgaged
to more than one secured creditor, they had to either come to an agreement, or
in the event of disagreement, there had to be a suit in which the dissenting
mortgagee had to be sued as a necessary party defendant. No doubt Section 29
of the SFC Act was intended to place the SFCs on a better footing. But, in our
view, this better footing is available only so long as the debtor is not a
company or is a going company. The moment a winding up order is made in
respect of a debtor company, the provisions of Section 529 and 529a come into
play and whatever superior rights had been ensured to SFCs under the provision
of the SFC Act are now subjected to and operate only in conjunction with the
special rights given to the workmen, who as pari passu charge-holders are
represented by the official liquidator. We are, therefore, of the view that
the unhindered right hitherto available to the SFCs to realise their security,
without recourse to the Court, no longer holds true as the right vested in the
official liquidator is a statutory impediment to such exercise and has to be
reckoned with. And since the official liquidator can do nothing without the
leave or concurrence of the Court, all necessary applications must, therefore,
come to the Company Court.
32\. We, therefore, hold as under:
::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 :::
KPPNair 31 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14
1\. The right unilaterally exercisable under Section 29 of the SFC Act is
available against a debtor, if a company, only so long as there is no order of
winding up;
2\. The SFCs cannot unilaterally act to realise the mortgaged properties
without the consent of the official liquidator representing workmen for the
pari passu charge in their favour under the proviso to Section 529 of the
Companies Act, 1956.
3\. If the official liquidator does not consent, the SFCs have to move the
Company court for appropriate directions to the official liquidator who is the
pari passu charge holder on behalf of the workmen. In any event, the official
liquidator cannot act without seeking directions from the Company Court and
under its supervision."
25\. Thus, after the introduction of Section 529-A which gave workers a pari
passu charge along with secured creditors in mortgaged or hypothecated
securities in a winding up, it is no longer open for a secured creditor to
contend that it is entitled to enforce its securities without reference to or
the leave of the Company Court.
26\. It was then contended on behalf of MMPL that the Official Liquidator
having failed to adjudicate the claims of the workmen, no pari passu charge in
their favour could be said to exist which would limit the right of the
subrogee to deal with the hypothecated securities. This argument is clearly
misconceived.

KPPNair 32 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 The mere fact that the Official
Liquidator has not yet adjudicated the claims of workmen would not disentitle
them to a pari passu charge or leave a secured creditor free to deal with a
security as he chooses.
27\. In the present case, there is some controversy as to whether some of the
employees of the company who have filed claims with the Official Liquidator
are workmen entitled to priority under Section 529-A of the Companies Act.
The Official Liquidator has furnished a list of persons who have filed claims
as workmen. Their claims aggregate to Rs. 1,09,86,378.95/-. It has been argued
on behalf of MMPL that "almost 50%" of these Claimants were employed in a
managerial or administrative capacity and therefore are not workmen entitled
to priority under Section 529-A. They have also contended that "almost 20%" of
the claims are unsupported by any documentary evidence. These are issues to be
determined by the Official Liquidator in the course of adjudication of the
claims. However, there does not appear to be the slightest doubt that atleast
some of the claims made before the Official Liquidator are by workmen of the
Company in Liquidation and that these claims are outstanding. That being so,
the ratio of the Judgment in International Coach Builders (supra) squarely
applies and the subrogee was obliged to seek directions from this Court with

hypothecated securities.
28\. It was then contended on behalf of Magnasound that the OL not having
objected to the recital in the Deed of Subrogation that no workers' claims had
been received, Shashi Gopal was then free to deal with the hypothecated assets
as he chose. This contention is misconceived. The secured creditor cannot
arrogate to himself the right to decide whether there are any workers' claims.
If workers' claims have been received and have not been adjudicated, he must
perforce apply to the Company Court seeking directions for sale. The fact that
the OL has not objected to the subrogation in favour of Shashi Gopal does not
constitute an admission of everything in the Deed of Subrogation particularly
an incorrect recital that no workers' claims have been received. The OL has no
obligation to object to such a recital and the absence of such an objection
cannot, in any event, constitute a rejection of the workers' claims which have
in fact been made. That being so, the Subrogee was not entitled to sell the
hypothecated assets by private treaty without reference to the Company Court.
29\. The fact that the Official Liquidator did not reply to the letter dated
9.5.2011 by which Shashi Gopal purported to inform the OL that he intended to
exercise a power of sale in respect of the hypothecated securities is also of

KPPNair 34 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 consequence. The Official Liquidator
has adverted to the circumstances in which his Office failed to reply to the
said letter. Even otherwise, a secured creditor is not entitled to rely on the
silence of the Official Liquidator to exercise a unilateral right of sale
without reference to the Company Court. The Official Liquidator is merely an
officer of the Court and acts under its directions. If the letter dated
9.5.2011 had come to his notice at the time of its receipt, he would have had
little choice but to place the matter before the Company Court by means of a
report for further directions. On such a report being placed, this Court would
have had the opportunity to consider the question and to issue appropriate
directions to safeguard the interests of the workers and other creditors of
the Company. In the absence of any response from the Official Liquidator,
Shashi Gopal as the subrogee was duty bound to move this Court for appropriate
directions in the matter of sale of the hypothecated securities. He certainly
was not entitled to assume that he was free to deal with the securities in any
manner that he pleased.
30\. The argument urged on behalf of MMPL that Shashi Gopal as a subrogee was
merely required to issue notice under Section 176 of the Contract Act to the
Official Liquidator, prior to a sale in any manner of his choosing, is
entirely  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55
::: KPPNair 35 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 devoid of merit. At the very
outset, it is doubtful whether Section 176 of the Contract Act which governs
the rights of a pledgee would have any application to the facts of the present
case where the securities were hypothecated, not pledged. Even otherwise, the
argument is misconceived for more reasons than one. The OL is not the owner of
the hypothecated securities. He is merely a custodian of it as an officer of
the Court. Further, it is clear from the law laid down in International Coach
Builders (supra) that once a company is in winding up and the workers have a
pari passu charge on the secured assets, no secured creditor would be entitled
to exercise a unilateral right of sale without reference to the Company Court
by merely issuing a notice of such proposed action to the OL.
31\. Even otherwise, the manner in which the hypothecated assets were sold by
Mr. Shashi Gopal leaves much to be desired. It was argued by Shashi Gopal and
MMPL that a subrogee does not stand in a fiduciary position towards the
principal debtor. This proposition is over broad. It appears to me clear from
the Judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Lallan Prasad (supra) and Jaya
Singh Dnyanu Mhoprekar (supra) that a pledgee or hypothecate would stand in a
fiduciary position qua the principal debtor to the limited extent that he has
a  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 :::
KPPNair 36 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 duty to secure the best possible
price while enforcing a security. It is on this account that the Apex Court in
Gajraj Jain (supra) and FCS Software Solutions (supra) mandates that a secured
creditor exercising a unilateral power of sale shall adopt every reasonable
precaution including obtaining a valuation of the asset proposed to be sold
and inviting offers by public notice. Further, any sale by a secured creditor
would be open to scrutiny to determine whether the transaction is at arms
length or with a related party. In a transaction of this nature, every
suspicion of a secret profit must be dispelled. In the present case, it is an
admitted position that there has been no valuation prior to sale nor were
offers invited from the public. The sale was effected, without the leave of
the Company Court, by private treaty in favour of a company which appears to
belong to the same group as the Company in Liquidation. Mr. P.M. Sudheer, a
director of MMPL who has sworn affidavits on its behalf, appears to have been
employed as the Manager (Accounts) of the Company in Liquidation. He has in
fact made a claim before the OL in that capacity for his outstanding dues.
Given these facts, even if no leave were required to be obtained by the
subrogee prior to the sale of the hypothecated securities, the sale in the
present case was infirm and open to challenge by the OL.

KPPNair 37 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14
32\. The question then arises as to whether the sale is liable to be set aside
under Section 536(2) or 537(1)(b) of the Companies Act. It has been contended
on behalf of Mr. Shashi Gopal and MMPL that any sale of the assets of a
Company in Liquidation by a third party would not fall within the ambit of
Section 536(2) and that the section would apply only to cases of sale of its
assets by the company itself after the commencement of winding up. However,
none of the judgments cited in this behalf by the Subrogee involve cases where
a third party sought to sell the assets of the company and the question arose
as to whether such a sale would fall foul of Section 536(2). Any observations
in these judgments have to be viewed in that context. The plain language of
the Section would in fact indicate that even sales sought to be effected by
third parties of the assets of a Company in Liquidation would fall within the
prohibitive ambit of that section. A sale by a third party would certainly be
within the mischief sought to be remedied by the Section, namely, the
prevention of any interference with the assets of a company in liquidation,
their sale in a manner to ensure the best possible price and the orderly
distribution of the sale proceeds. The Judgments cited on behalf of the
subrogee in respect of what is commonly referred to as the "mischief rule" in
the interpretation of statutes would appear to support the construction of
Section 536(2) canvassed on behalf  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 :::
Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 ::: KPPNair 38 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO.
188/14 of the Official Liquidator.
33\. Even otherwise, this issue appears to me of limited relevance insofar as
a sale by a third party would in any event fall within the ambit of Section
537(1)
(b). The fact that the report of the OL has not made a reference to Section
537(1)(b) would by itself be of no consequence. If a secured creditor is
required to obtain the leave of the Company Court to enforce a security by
sale as held in International Coach Builders (supra) then it would necessarily
follow that a sale effected without leave would be void under Sections 536(2)
and/or 537(1) (b).
In the present case, the Subrogee has made no application seeking the leave of
this Court, even ex post facto, for the sale of the said asset. The sale would
therefore be liable to be set aside.
34\. In any event, the burden clearly lies on the person seeking to maintain a
sale (which is not in the ordinary course of business) under Sections 536(2)
and 537 (1) (b) to prove that the sale was for the benefit of the Company.
This Court has so held on several occasions including in its Judgments in
Hindustan Transmissions Ltd. (supra) and Sunita Vasudeo Warke (supra). In the
present case, neither Shashi Gopal nor MMPL have made any attempt to discharge
that  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55 :::
KPPNair 39 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 burden. In view of the burden being
cast upon the person seeking leave to validate a transaction that is otherwise
void, the contention advanced on behalf of Mr. Shashi Gopal that the OL has
not alleged undervaluation in the sale is entirely misconceived. The burden
does not lie upon the OL to do so. In any event, it is self evident that the
assets have been undervalued. The agreements between MMPL and Sony Music
belatedly disclosed in the course of the hearing would themselves show that
the assets were undervalued. While the sale by Shashi Gopal in favour of MMPL
of the entire repertoire was for a sum of Rs. 1.5 crores, the agreements
executed by MMPL in favour of Sony Music for part of the repertoire for a
limited period is for a sum of Rs. 1.75 crores without even taking into
account any revenue overflow in which MMPL was entitled to share.
35\. It has been urged on behalf of Shashi Gopal in his Written Submissions
(though not on affidavit) that the Master tapes were handed over to the OL in
good condition when he took over the assets of the Company in Liquidation
while their condition was very poor when they were handed over to Shashi Gopal
pursuant to directions of the DRT. He further claims that he was constrained
to devote considerable time and money to repairing/reconstructing  :::

40 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 the Master tapes. Similarly, Sony Media has
claimed to have expended considerable resources on rendering the Master tapes
usable. Apart from the fact that the claims made by the two parties are
somewhat at odds, no material or particulars in support of these allegations
including the amounts alleged to have been expended have been furnished by
either party.
36\. Shashi Gopal has also contended, in support of his submission that the
sale ought not to be set aside, that if the hypothecated securities had been
sold by the DRT under the Consent Decree in favour of UBI, any overflow would
have been appropriated by the bank and would not have enured to the benefit of
the workers. This argument loses sight of the fact that the hypothecated
securities were in fact not sold under the Consent Decree, but by the subrogee
arrogating to himself illegally a unilateral power of sale.
37\. In the course of the hearing, an offer was made by MMPL to secure an
amount of Rs. 30,00,000/- by way of workers' claims pending adjudication
thereof by the Official Liquidator. This was on the basis that the total of
the workmens' claims was Rs. 1,09,86,378.95/-. If the claim were to be allowed
in its entirety (which MMPL contends for various reasons is unlikely) it is
claimed  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015 00:00:55
::: KPPNair 41 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 that the pari passu charge of
the workmen would be to the extent of Rs.
25,77,000/- insofar as the total dues of Shashi Gopal as a secured
creditor/subrogee is Rs. 5,29,54,857.99/-. It was contended that on such
security being offered, the challenge to the sale must necessarily fail. The
offer, however, proceeds on the premise that Rs. 1.5 crores is a fair price
for the hypothecated securities. As I have already noted, Shashi Gopal and
Magnasound have failed to discharge their burden of demonstrating that the
consideration of Rs. 1.5 crores was in fact a fair value for the hypothecated
securities. In the present case, there is some controversy as to the amount
that Shashi Gopal would be entitled to recover from the Company in liquidation
in his capacity as a subrogee. He would no doubt be entitled to recover such
amounts as he has himself paid to UBI. These will require verification by the
OL. These amounts having been paid after the commencement of winding up, he
would not be entitled to any interest thereon unless there were a surplus
after all creditors of the company were paid off. Apart from these
considerations which make the offer unacceptable, it is also curious that the
offer proceeds from MMPL rather than the subrogee. If anything, this itself is
a tacit admission that the amount of Rs. 1.5 crores that was paid by MMPL for
the hypothecated securities was an undervaluation.

KPPNair 42 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14
38\. That apart, the duty of the Official Liquidator and the Company Court is
to ensure that the interest of all stakeholders including the workers and
creditors, both secured and unsecured, are protected. Further, the Deed of
Subrogation would appear to indicate that apart from the hypothecated
securities, there are other securities as well including a bungalow at
Lonavala which have been handed over to Shashi Gopal in his capacity as a
subrogee. It is entirely conceivable that the amount to which the subrogee is
entitled would not exceed the value of all of these securities. It is
therefore imperative that each security fetch the best possible price. The
manner in which the repertoire of the company in liquidation has been sold by
the subrogee was however not designed to secure this outcome.
39\. The circumstances of the present case leave little doubt that the sale
itself, without the leave of the court and given the manner in which it was
effected, was unlawful. However, this leaves open the question as to what
order would meet the ends of justice in the present case. The Official
Liquidator not having in his possession the masters or the agreements or
indeed any documents in respect of the repertoire which constitutes the
hypothecated  ::: Uploaded on - 21/10/2015 ::: Downloaded on - 22/10/2015
00:00:55 ::: KPPNair 43 CP 719/2002 a/w OLR NO. 188/14 security, a valuation
exercise to determine what ought to have been the fair value of the
hypothecated security at the time of its sale by Shashi Gopal appears
impracticable. However, MMPL ought not to be permitted to profit from a sale
that is clearly void. To the extent that the transaction between MMPL and Sony
Music is at arms length, the two being unrelated, the consideration fixed in
the Agreements between MMPL and Sony Music can be taken to represent the true
market value of the rights transacted. The sale of the hypothecated securities
by Shashi Gopal to MMPL being void, the consideration paid/payable by Sony
Music ought to enure to the benefit of the Company in Liquidation and its
various stakeholders including workers and creditors. In these circumstances,
I pass the following Order which in my view would meet the ends of justice:
a) The Deed of Assignment dated 14.03.2012 between Shashi Gopal and MMPL in
respect of the hypothecated securities is set aside as illegal and void.
MMPL shall on or before 2 nd December,2015, deposit a sum of Rs. 25
b) lakhs with the Official Liquidator, being the difference between the amount
already received by MMPL from Sony Music (Rs. 1.75 crores) and the amount paid
by MMPL to Shashi Gopal (Rs. 1.5 crores).
