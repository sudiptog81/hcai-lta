    CORAM
    HON'BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU
                                   JUDGMENT
Division Bench had held that the statement of defendant could not be
considered at that stage and had proceeded on the basis that question as to
jurisdiction would have to be ascertained on the basis of the averments made
in the plaint. In the present case, the plaint read as a whole does not
disclose it to be predicated on an apprehended infringement in future.
31\. The reliance placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the decision in the
case of M/s Allied Blenders & Distillers (supra) is also misplaced as in that
case, the Court had noted the stand of the defendant that it was not opposing
the territorial jurisdiction of this Court except to show malafides of the
plaintiff and in view of the aforesaid stand, the Court had specifically noted
that it was not considering the objection to territorial jurisdiction of the
Court for the relief claimed of injunction and passing off, thus, the issue as
to territorial jurisdiction, was not agitated in that case.

In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is of the view that the plaint is
liable to be returned.
                                   JUDGMENT
VIBHU BAKHRU, J IA No. 19059/2015 (U/O VII Rule 10 CPC read with Section 151
CPC)
1\. This is an application filed on behalf of defendant no.1 under Order VII
Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908, inter alia, praying that the
plaint be returned.
2\. The plaintiff is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and
is, inter alia, engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing
alcoholic beverages, including Indian Made Foreign Liquor (hereafter 'IMFL').
The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that it sells CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 1
of 16 alcoholic beverages under various distinctive trademarks and labels
including "Officer's Choice".
3\. The plaintiff has further claimed that its trademark and label "Officer's
Choice" have acquired an enviable reputation and goodwill and is one of the
highest selling brands. The plaintiff claims that it has incurred extensive
expenditure to promote and publicize its product under the mark "Officer's
Choice" which has now become a well-known trademark. The plaintiff is the
registered proprietor of the trademark "Officer's Choice" in various classes
and details of the same have been provided in paragraph 6 of the plaint.
4\. Defendant no.1 is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and
has its registered office in the State of Maharashtra. The plaintiff also
claims that defendant no.1 holds a sub-lease from defendant no.2 which has its
registered office in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The plaintiff states that
defendant no.1 is, inter alia, engaged in the business of bottling and
manufacturing alcoholic beverages, including whisky under a trademark "Smart
Choice" which the plaintiff claims, is deceptively and confusingly similar to
the plaintiff's trademark "Officer's Choice". It is further alleged that the
label used by defendant no. 1 is also substantially similar to plaintiff's
label "Officer's Choice".
5\. On the basis of the averments made in the plaint, the plaintiff has, inter
alia, prayed for a decree of permanent injunction restraining infringement of
trademark and for a decree of permanent injunction restraining infringement of
copyright as well as passing off.
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 2 of 16
6\. The applicant (defendant no.1) claims that no part of the cause of action
to file the present plaint has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of
this Court. It has premised the present application on the aforesaid assertion
claiming that the plaint is liable to be returned.
7\. Mr Hemant Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant
(defendant no. 1) drew the attention of this Court to the various averments
made in the plaint and submitted that since the cause of action as pleaded by
the plaintiff has arisen in the State of Andhra Pradesh, this Court would have
no jurisdiction to try the present suit. He further drew the attention of this
Court to paragraph 27 of the plaint and contended that the plaintiff had
pleaded that this Court had the jurisdiction to decide the suit on the basis
that the plaintiff's office was located in Delhi and that the plaintiff was
also carrying on its business within the jurisdiction of this Court in a
variety of ways including by selling its products under the relevant
trademarks. He submitted that the plaintiff also has a zonal office in Andhra
Pradesh and since the cause of action had arisen in the State of Andhra
Pradesh where the plaintiff also carries on its business, the Courts at Andhra
Pradesh and not this Court would have the jurisdiction to try the present
suit.
8\. He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing
Rights Society Limited v. Sanjay Dalia and Another: (2015) 10 SCC 161 and the
decision of a Division Bench of this Court in Ultra Home Construction Pvt.
Ltd. v. Purushottam Kumar Chaubey & Ors.: 2016 (65) PTC 469 (Del) (DB) in
support of his contention that the Courts, where the cause of action arises,
would have the jurisdiction to try the suit if the plaintiff also had a
subordinate/branch office at the said place; and, CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 3 of
16 the Courts having jurisdiction over the place where the plaintiff's
principal office was situated would not have the jurisdiction to try the suit
if the cause of action had arisen in another place and the plaintiff also had
an office at the said place.
9\. Mr Rajiv Nayar, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiff/ non-
applicant did not dispute that by virtue of the law as laid down by the
Supreme Court in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), this Court
would not have any jurisdiction if no part of cause of action had arisen
within the territorial limits of this Court. He, however, contended that in
the present case, the cause of action had arisen in Delhi since it was pleaded
that defendant no.1 was a unit of Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. and Tilaknagar
Industries Ltd. were located in Delhi. He also submitted that the plaintiff
had also averred that it strongly apprehended that defendant no. 1 could
launch their products in Delhi and there was a reasonable apprehension that
defendant no.1 had a distribution network in Delhi. Thus, the plaint disclosed
that a part of the cause of action had arisen within the territorial limits of
Delhi. He submitted that the present plaint was in the nature of quia timet
action where the cause of action included an apprehension of injury within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court and, therefore, this Court would have
the jurisdiction to decide the suit. He further submitted that the question of
jurisdiction was a mixed question of fact and law which would be determined at
the stage of trial. He strongly relied on the decision of the Division Bench
of this Court in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Ors. v. Natco Pharma
Ltd.: (2014) 210 DLT 591 (DB) and the decision of a Coordinate Bench of this
Court in M/s Allied Blenders & Distillers Pvt. Ltd. v. Shree Nath Heritage
Liquor Pvt. Ltd.: 2014 (59) PTC 42 (Del).
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 4 of 16
10\. Mr Nayar also relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Exphar SA
and Another v. Eupharma Laboratories Ltd. and Another: (2004) 3 SCC 688 and
the decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Pfizer Products, Inc. v.
Rajesh Chopra & Ors.: 2003 (32) PTC 301 (Del.) in support of his contention
that the objection as to the jurisdiction must be considered on the basis of
the averments made in the plaint alone.
Reasoning and Conclusion
11\. It is trite law that an objection under Order VII Rule 10 CPC as to the
territorial jurisdiction of a Court at the pre-trial stage, is to be
considered only on the basis of the averments made in the plaint and the
material produced by the plaintiff without looking into the written statement
filed by the defendant. In Exphar SA and Another (supra), the Supreme Court
had observed that:
> "when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by way of demurrer and not at
> the trial, the objection must proceed on the basis that the facts as pleaded
> by the initiator of the impugned proceedings are true. The submission in
> order to succeed must show that granted those facts the court does not have
> jurisdiction as a matter of law. In rejecting a plaint on the ground of
> jurisdiction, the Division Bench should have taken the allegations contained
> in the plaint to be correct."
12\. In view of the above, at this stage, the question whether this Court has
the jurisdiction to try the present suit would have to be considered on
demurrer; without looking into the defence pleaded by the defendants.
13\. As stated earlier, Mr Nayar did not contest the position that this Court
would not have jurisdiction to entertain the present suit only on the basis
that the plaintiff's office was situated in Delhi or that the plaintiff CS(OS)
2267/2013 Page 5 of 16 carried on its business in Delhi. He fairly conceded
that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing Rights
Society Limited (supra) as followed by this Court in Ultra Home Construction
(supra), merely because the plaintiff had an office in Delhi would not confer
the jurisdiction on this Court to try the suit if the cause of action had not
arisen within the territorial limits of this Court. He had, however, submitted
that the present suit was a quia timet action and the plaintiff apprehended
that defendant no. 1 would launch its product in Delhi and, thus, this Court
would have the jurisdiction to try the suit.
14\. In view of the above, the only question to be considered at this stage is
whether the averments made in the plaint indicate that the present suit is a
quia timet action and is based on the plaintiff's apprehension of infringement
of trademark/copyright within the territorial limits of this Court.
15\. In order to address the above controversy, it is necessary to examine the
averments made in the plaint in some detail.
16\. In paragraph one of the plaint, the plaintiff has averred that its
registered office is located at the address in Mumbai and that its sales
office is located within the seat of Delhi. It is also averred that the
plaintiff carries on extensive business activities in Delhi as well as in
other States of India. The plaintiff has described its activities in paragraph
nos. 2 to 5 of its plaint. The plaintiff has described its registered
trademarks as well as trade label in the plaint. The plaintiff has further
provided the history of the use of the trademark and trade label "Officer's
Choice" and has made averments relating to plaintiff's title and use of the
trademarks.
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 6 of 16
17\. In paragraph 18 of the plaint, the plaintiff has described defendant no.1
to be a company having its registered office at P.O. Tilaknagar, Tal.
Shrirampur, Dist. Ahmednagar, Shrirampur, Maharashtra. It is also averred that
defendant no.1 holds a sub-lease from defendant no.2, which has its registered
office at 34, Satamrai Village, Gaganpahad Mandal, Andhra Pradesh. In
paragraph 18 of the plaint, the plaintiff has specifically pleaded as under:-
> ".......It is believed that the Defendant No. l is engaged in the business
> of blending, bottling, manufacturing, producing and selling alcoholic
> beverages, including whisky under the mark "Smart Choice" (hereinafter
> referred to as the "impugned mark")....."
18\. The plaintiff has averred that the impugned mark "Smart Choice" is
deceptively and confusingly similar to plaintiff's registered trademark
"Officer's Choice" and further the Label "Smart Choice" is also a substantial
reproduction of the plaintiff's "Officer's Choice" label.
19\. In paragraph 20 of the plaint, the plaintiff has stated that it became
aware of the defendant's infringing activities in September, 2013 when it came
across defendant's whisky being sold in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The
plaintiff had further claimed that use by defendants of the label and trade
dress and use of the prefix "Smart" to the suffix "Choice" is indicative of
the malafide intent of the defendants. The averments made in paragraph 22 of
the plaint are to the effect that defendants had substantially reproduced the
very nuance of the plaintiff's label and had slavishly reproduced plaintiff's
original, unique and distinctive artistic work for the inferior products.
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 7 of 16
20\. A plain reading of the averments made in paragraph nos. 20 to 25 indicate
that the plaintiff is aggrieved by the use - and not the apprehended use - of
the impugned mark (Smart Choice) and label by the defendants. The relevant
averments indicating the same are set out below:-
> "20. The Plaintiff first became aware of the Defendants infringing
> activities in September, 2013 when the Plaintiffs representatives came
> across the Defendants' "Smart Choice" whisky product being sold in the state
> of Andhra Pradesh. The Plaintiff was shocked to learn that the impugned mark
> was strikingly similar to its proprietary trademark "Officer's Choice" and
> the impugned label with its red, white and gold colour combination, gold
> border and the word "Smart Choice" written in astylized gold font with a red
> shadow had a colour scheme/pattern which was a slavish imitation of the
> Plaintiff's label. The Defendants' product is therefore, an infringement of
> the Plaintiff's proprietary rights in its trademark and copyright vesting in
> the artistic work in the label. A bare perusal of the Defendants' product
> evidences an intention to pass off its products as being associated with
> and/or emanating from the Plaintiff. The Defendants have slavishly imitated
> and reproduced the overall get up, layout, color scheme and arrangement of
> features as the Plaintiff's label. Further, use by the Defendants' of the
> impugned mark and label reflects an intention to confuse unwary customers
> and to encash upon the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the Plaintiff's
> product. The impugned "Smart Choice" label is reproduced below:
> 21\. The adoption and use by the Defendants of a label/trade dress that is a
> rip-off of the Plaintiff's original and unique label/trade dress is blatant,
> brazen and unauthorized. It is clear that the impugned label/artistic work
> is a copy of the Plaintiff's label/artistic work and the degree and extent
> of similarity dismisses the likelihood of it being a mere coincidence.
> Further, it is apparent that the Plaintiff's proprietary trademark
> "Officer's Choice" has inspired the Defendant to come up with the impugned
> mark for CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 8 of 16 identical products. The Defendant's
> aim is to pass of its product as a variant of the Plaintiff's product or as
> one having a connection or association with the Plaintiff's well-known
> whisky products. The Plaintiff has used the mark "Officer's Choice"
> extensively, continuously and uninterruptedly for over20 years and the
> Defendants' use of the prefix "Smart" to the suffix "Choice" in the impugned
> mark is a dead give-away as to the intent and malafide of the Defendants.
> 22\. The Defendants have substantially reproduced the very nuance of the
> Plaintiff's label and have no reasons whatsoever to adopt the same. The
> Plaintiff is the prior user, adopter and registered proprietor of the said
> label that was specifically commissioned by it for its own whisky products.
> The Defendants have expended no time, money or effort to design their own
> label and have chosen to slavishly reproduce the Plaintiff's original,
> unique and distinct artistic work for their inferior products. Further, use
> of a deceptively similar trademark amounts to confusing the consuming public
> into believing that the Defendants' goods originate from the Plaintiff's
> repertoire or are in some way associated with or a variant of the
> Plaintiff's well-known "Officer's Choice" products. This is a clear case of
> initial interest confusion as the relevant public would take a second look
> at the Defendants' infringing product solely on account of its deceptive
> similarity to the Plaintiff's label and trademark. This reflects deceit and
> malafide on part of the Defendants.
> 23\. The dishonesty on part of the Defendant is further evident from the
> fact that the impugned mark and label are being used with respect to
> identical goods i.e. whisky that are sold through the same trade channels.
> The sale and distribution of the Defendants' whisky products bearing the
> impugned mark and label would result in tremendous harm and prejudice to the
> Plaintiff's business, rights and interests. The impugned label has been
> dishonestly copied by the Defendants such that a consumer of ordinary
> intelligence and imperfect recollection is likely to believe CS(OS)
> 2267/2013 Page 9 of 16 that the Defendants' products are emanating from
> and/or connected to the Plaintiff's line of products.
> 24\. Further, the unauthorized use of the impugned mark and label by the
> Defendants whether for sale and distribution in India or for export and
> distribution abroad is an act of blatant infringement of the Plaintiff's
> statutory rights and also a violation of its common law rights. The
> Defendants obviously intend to misrepresent and pass off their products as
> those of the Plaintiff in a way so as to make undeserved profits by riding
> on the coattails of the Plaintiff and thereby, causing incalculable damage
> and losses to the Plaintiff's business reputation both in India and abroad.
> It is submitted that the Plaintiff's "Officer's Choice" trademark has
> acquired international reputation and goodwill and the same qualifies as a
> famous and well- known trademark as envisaged in Section 11 of the Trade
> Mark Act, 1999. The Plaintiff reserves its right to seek damages against the
> Defendants in the event proceedings in the present suit necessitate the
> same. The Plaintiff further craves leave to amend the pleadings in this
> regard.
> 25\. The use of the impugned trademark and label by the Defendants also
> amounts to false trade description as defined under the provisions of the
> Trade Marks Act, 1999, in as much as it induces the consumers and members of
> the trade to falsely believe that:-
> a) the Defendants have a nexus or affiliation with the Plaintiff; or
> b) the Defendants have been granted a license to use the said label in
> relation to an identical class of products;
> c) the business of the Defendants have been endorsed by the Plaintiff; or
> d) the Plaintiff has released a variant of its whisky "Officer's Choice" in
> the market under the name "Smart Choice".
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 10 of 16
> As such the Defendants have no justification or explanation whatsoever for
> their unauthorized use and adoption of the impugned label and mark for
> identical products. The intended illegal trade activities of the Defendants
> are likely to cause harm and injury to the business, goodwill and reputation
> of the Plaintiff."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 21\. A plain reading of the aforesaid plaint clearly indicates that the
> principal grievance articulated by the plaintiff in its plaint which has
> occasioned the filing of the present suit, is use of a trademark and label
> which is claimed to be a deceptively similar trademark and label of the
> plaintiff. There is no averment in the entire plaint from paragraphs nos. 1
> to 25 which would indicate that the plaintiff apprehended the use of the
> trade mark in question in future; on the contrary the averments articulate
> the plaintiff's grievance regarding the use of the trademark by the
> defendant.
The reading of the plaint does not indicate that it is occasioned by any
apprehension of a future launch of the products by defendants. This is amply
clear from paragraph no. 26 of the plaint which describes the cause of action
for filing the plaint. The same is set out below:-
> "CAUSE OF ACTION
> 26\. The cause of action arose for the first time around the third week of
> September, 2013 when the Plaintiff came across the Defendants' product being
> sold under the impugned mark and label "Smart Choice" in the State of Andhra
> Pradesh. The Plaintiff has approached this Hon'ble Court at the earliest
> possible opportunity. The cause of action against the Defendants is
> continuing from day to day till the filing of the present suit and will
> continue until the Defendants are restrained by an order of injunction by
> this Hon'ble Court."
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 11 of 16
22\. However, in paragraph 27 of the plaint - which is the paragraph regarding
the jurisdiction - the plaintiff has averred that it has reasonable
apprehension that the defendants have a distribution network in Delhi or are
likely to sell the products bearing the impugned mark and label within the
jurisdiction of this Court and, therefore, this Court would have the necessary
jurisdiction by virtue of Section 20 of CPC.
23\. Although, it has been averred that the plaintiff has an apprehension that
defendants would sell their products within the territories of Delhi, the said
apprehension is not substantiated by any material which would indicate a
reasonable ground for the plaintiff to apprehend the same.
24\. Be that as it may, the principal question to be addressed that still
remains is whether the averments made in paragraph 27 of the plaint have the
effect of establishing the plaint to be a quia timet action.
25\. It is well settled that the plaint must be read as a whole. A plain
reading of the plaint from paragraph 1 to paragraph 26, which sets out the
averments indicating the plaintiff's claim as well as its grievance - the
cause of action - clearly indicate that the suit is based on the present use
of the trademark/label "Smart Choice" by defendant no.1 and not on any
apprehended use of the said trademark. The expression "quia timet" is a Latin
expression meaning "because he fears". The Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth
Edition, defines the same as "a legal doctrine that allows a person to seek
equitable relief from future probable harm to a specific right or interest".
It further defines "quia timet injunction" as "an injunction granted to
prevent an action that has been threatened but has not yet violated the
plaintiff's rights".
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 12 of 16
26\. The Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 30A, 2007 Edition, explains the concept
of "quia timet " in equity as under:
> "Preventive relief; quia timet.
> A class of cases whose jurisdiction depends chiefly or altogether on the
> necessity for relief obtainable only in equity, is that of "bills quia
> timet," whose objective it is to prevent anticipated mischiefs which could
> not after their occurrence be adequately redressed. Bills quia timet lie
> where a person has reasonable fears of being subjected to future
> inconvenience by reason of the neglect, inadvertence, or culpability of
> another. They are writs of prevention to accomplish the ends of
> precautionary justice, and they are designed to prevent wrongs rather than
> to redress them when done.
> While equity will not interfere for the purpose of declaring rights to
> prevent a possible controversy which has not yet arisen, or where no actual
> danger to the plaintiff's rights is shown, it will interfere to prevent a
> multiplicity of suits, or to protect the subject matter of a controversy
> where there is actual danger that it may be so dealt with as to prejudice
> the plaintiff's rights."
27\. In Kuldip Singh v. Subhash Chander Jain & Ors.: (2000) 4 SCC 50, the
Supreme Court had explained the 'quia timet action' as under:-
> "6. A quia timet action is a bill in equity. It is an action preventive in
> nature and a specie of precautionary justice intended to prevent apprehended
> wrong or anticipated mischief and not to undo a wrong or mischief when it
> has already been done. In such an action the Court, if convinced, may
> interfere by appointment of receiver or by directing security to be
> furnished or by issuing an injunction or any other remedial process."
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 13 of 16
28\. As stated above, the cause of action in the present case - even as
described by the plaintiff in paragraph no. 26 of its plaint - is not of any
apprehended injury by future action but essentially stems from the use of the
trademark/label "Smart Choice" by the defendant in praesanti. It is alleged
that defendant no.1 is using the trademark in Andhra Pradesh, which was
discovered by the plaintiff in 2013; and this is the cause of action for the
plaint as pleaded by the plaintiff.
29\. A mere bald statement at the end of the plaint which has no foundation in
the entire plaint cannot be accepted as indicating the cause of action; the
averments made in the plaint must, ex-facie, disclose the cause of action.
Thus, the contention that part of cause of action has arisen within the
territories of this Court since the plaintiff has made a bald statement that
it apprehends that defendant would launch its product in Delhi, cannot be
accepted.
30\. In the case of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (supra), the Division Bench
had held that once the plaintiff had pleaded the apprehension of
sale/marketing in Delhi, the Courts in Delhi would have to entertain the suit
and the same could not be ousted by the defendant making a statement not to do
any such act in Delhi. However, in that case, the plaint was based on the
plaintiff's apprehension of an emanating launch of the drug Glatiramer Acetate
for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The Court specifically noted that the
plaint contained pleadings to the effect that the news article was published
on 17.01.2012 reporting that the defendants would work with Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MPI) to launch Glatiramer Acetate for the treatment of
multiple sclerosis and the plaintiffs on making enquiries had learnt that MPI
had signed an agreement with the defendant CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 14 of 16
therein relating to development and marketing of Glatiramer Acetate in the
United States. Thus, the pleadings clearly indicated that the plaintiff
therein had filed the suit apprehending an injury and its cause of action
included an apprehended injury by manufacture and sale of MPI's proposed
Glatiramer Acetate. The substantial cause of action appears to have been based
on acts that were imminent and which were pleaded with sufficient particulars.
This is plainly clear from the reading of the judgement of the Single Judge
(See: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited v. NATCO Pharma Limited: 212
(2014) DLT 312). It is, in this context, the Division Bench had noted that the
jurisdiction of this Court would not be ousted. It is relevant to note that
the decision of the Single Bench in that case was based on the defendant's
statement that they would not do any such act as apprehended, in Delhi. The
Division Bench had held that the statement of defendant could not be
considered at that stage and had proceeded on the basis that question as to
jurisdiction would have to be ascertained on the basis of the averments made
in the plaint. In the present case, the plaint read as a whole does not
disclose it to be predicated on an apprehended infringement in future.
31\. The reliance placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the decision in the
case of M/s Allied Blenders & Distillers (supra) is also misplaced as in that
case, the Court had noted the stand of the defendant that it was not opposing
the territorial jurisdiction of this Court except to show malafides of the
plaintiff and in view of the aforesaid stand, the Court had specifically noted
that it was not considering the objection to territorial jurisdiction of the
Court for the relief claimed of injunction and passing off, thus, the issue as
to territorial jurisdiction, was not agitated in that case.
CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 15 of 16
In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is of the view that the plaint is
liable to be returned.
32\. In view of the above, the present application is allowed. The plaint is,
accordingly, liable to be returned.

VIBHU BAKHRU, J IA No. 19059/2015 (U/O VII Rule 10 CPC read with Section 151
CPC)
1\. This is an application filed on behalf of defendant no.1 under Order VII
Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908, inter alia, praying that the
plaint be returned.
2\. The plaintiff is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and
is, inter alia, engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing
alcoholic beverages, including Indian Made Foreign Liquor (hereafter 'IMFL').
The plaintiff has averred in the plaint that it sells CS(OS) 2267/2013 Page 1
of 16 alcoholic beverages under various distinctive trademarks and labels
including "Officer's Choice".
3\. The plaintiff has further claimed that its trademark and label "Officer's
Choice" have acquired an enviable reputation and goodwill and is one of the
highest selling brands. The plaintiff claims that it has incurred extensive
expenditure to promote and publicize its product under the mark "Officer's
Choice" which has now become a well-known trademark. The plaintiff is the
registered proprietor of the trademark "Officer's Choice" in various classes
and details of the same have been provided in paragraph 6 of the plaint.
4\. Defendant no.1 is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and
Division Bench had held that the statement of defendant could not be
considered at that stage and had proceeded on the basis that question as to
jurisdiction would have to be ascertained on the basis of the averments made
in the plaint. In the present case, the plaint read as a whole does not
disclose it to be predicated on an apprehended infringement in future.
31\. The reliance placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the decision in the
case of M/s Allied Blenders & Distillers (supra) is also misplaced as in that
case, the Court had noted the stand of the defendant that it was not opposing
the territorial jurisdiction of this Court except to show malafides of the
plaintiff and in view of the aforesaid stand, the Court had specifically noted
that it was not considering the objection to territorial jurisdiction of the
Court for the relief claimed of injunction and passing off, thus, the issue as
to territorial jurisdiction, was not agitated in that case.
