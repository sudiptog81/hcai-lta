sng 5 appeal-340,95n387.15 FACTS OF APPEAL NO.340 OF 2015
4\. A brief reference to the facts of the case will be necessary. For the sake
of convenience, we are referring to the parties to the Appeals according to
their status before the learned Single Judge. In Appeal No.340 of 2015, by the
Judgment and Order impugned, the learned Single Judge has permitted joinder of
cause of action of passing off of the trade mark with the cause of action for
infringement of a registered trade mark. The cause of action of passing off of
the trade mark has arisen outside the limits of Mumbai.
5\. The first Plaintiff claims to be a registered Proprietor of the trade mark
"TR" in respect of the goods specified in Clause 7 of Schedule IV to the Trade
Mark Rules, 2002. The first Plaintiff has claimed in the suit that it has been
extensively using trade mark since the year 1980 in India in respect of its
products. According to the case of the Plaintiffs, the second Plaintiff is the
sole Distributor of the first Plaintiff for its goods bearing the mark "TR".
According to the case of the Plaintiffs, the first Plaintiff has duly
authorized the second Plaintiff to use the trade mark TR in India.
6\. It is stated in the Plaint that some time in the beginning of January
2013, they became aware about the activity of the Defendants ::: Uploaded on -
07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 6
appeal-340,95n387.15 of manufacturing, marketing, selling or distributing
comparable goods under the mark/label TR which is identical or deceptively
similar to the registered trade mark of the Plaintiffs. The case made out in
the Plaint is that the action of the Defendants of adoption and use of the
mark/label TR is dishonest. It is their case that such adoption and use of the
mark/label TR by the Defendants constitutes not only an infringement of the
Plaintiffs' trade mark but also amounts to passing off of the Defendants'
goods as those of the Plaintiffs.
7\. According to the case made out in the Plaint, the first Plaintiff is based
in China but carries on business in Mumbai through its exclusive distributor-
the second Plaintiff. It is stated that the second Plaintiff has its address
within the Original Jurisdiction of this Court and the second Plaintiff has
been authorized by the first Plaintiff to use its registered trade mark.
Therefore, the Plaintiffs have brought the suit on the Original Side of this
Court seeking an infringement action in respect of their registered trade
mark. The Plaintiffs prayed for grant of a leave under Clause XIV of the
Letter Patent to permit them to combine the cause of action of passing off
with the causes of action for infringement. A separate leave Petition was
filed by the Plaintiffs in which it was contended that though the Defendants
carry on business and sell the alleged offending goods outside the Original
Jurisdiction of this Court, the evidence relating to the cause of action of
passing off ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017
02:41:33 ::: sng 7 appeal-340,95n387.15 and the evidence relating to the
causes of action for infringement would be common. That is the reason why a
leave was claimed under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. There were separate
affidavits-in-reply filed by the Defendants. A detailed affidavit-in-reply was
filed by the fourth Defendant which was adopted by the other three Defendants
by filing their affidavit-in-reply. The fourth Defendant denied the factual
contentions raised by the Plaintiffs. It was contended that there is no
material placed on record to show that the second Plaintiff is a Distributor
much less an exclusive Distributor of the first Plaintiff. It was submitted
that the first Plaintiff and the second Plaintiff have failed to prove the
nexus with each other. It was submitted that mere alleged fact of
distributorship is not sufficient for the Plaintiffs to invoke the Original
Jurisdiction of this Court under Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (for
short "the Trade Marks Act"). It was submitted that the cause of action for
filing an action for infringement has not arisen within the Ordinary Original
Civil Jurisdiction of this Court and, therefore, a leave under Clause XII of
the Letter Patent cannot be granted.
FACTS OF APPEAL NO.387 OF 2015
8\. In Appeal No.387 of 2015, the Original Defendant has taken an exception to
the order dated 29 th January 2015 passed by the learned Single Judge granting
leave under Clause XIV of the Letters ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 8 appeal-340,95n387.15 Patent. The
first Plaintiff is a subsidiary company of the second Plaintiff. It is claimed
that the Plaintiffs are the registered proprietors of various trade marks
bearing the name "UltraTech" as a part of their trade marks. The suit relates
to 9 trade marks mentioned in Paragraph 8 of the Plaint. The first Plaintiff
is a registered proprietor of the trade marks listed at serial nos.2 to 7 and
the second Plaintiff is a registered proprietor of the trade marks listed at
serial nos.1, 8 and 9. All these trade marks contain the words "Ultra Tech" or
"Ultra" as part of them. According to the case of the Plaintiffs, by a Deed of
Assignment dated 30th September 2009, the trade marks containing the words
"UltraTech" and "Ultra" standing in the name of the first Plaintiff were
assigned by the first Plaintiff in the name of second Plaintiff along with the
goodwill of the business concern. Reliance is also placed on the License
Agreement dated 29th June 2011 under which the second Plaintiff has permitted
the first Plaintiff to use the trade marks with the words "UltraTech" and
"Ultra". The case made out in the Plaint is that the Defendant started using a
trademark containing the word "Ultra". It is contended that the words
"UltraTech" and "Ultra" are the essential and prominent features of the trade
marks bearing the word "UltraTech". It is alleged that the use of the
Defendant of a trade mark containing the word "Ultra" amounts to an
infringement of "UltraTech" trade marks. It is contended in the Plaint that as
the Plaintiffs are carrying on business in Mumbai, in view of Sub-section (2)
of Section 134 of the Trade ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 9 appeal-340,95n387.15 Marks Act, this Court has
Original Jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action of infringement. It is
alleged that by means of use of trade marks with the word "Ultra" as a part of
it, the Defendant is passing off its goods as the goods of the Plaintiffs.
Therefore, a prayer was made for grant of leave under Clause XIV of the
Letters Patent for clubbing the cause of action of passing off.
9\. By way of reply to the Petition for grant of leave under Clause XIV of the
Letters Patent, the contention of the Defendant is mainly that this Court does
not have jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action of infringement and,
therefore, there is no question of grant of a leave under Clause XIV of the
Letters Patent.
FACTS OF APPEAL NO.95 OF 2015
10\. As far as the Appeal No.95 of 2015 is concerned, the Appellant/the
Original first Defendant has taken an exception to the order dated 14th
January 2015 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court granting leave
under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. The Plaintiff in the said suit claims
to be a registered proprietor of the trade mark "CHERI" in Class 5 in respect
of pharmaceutical preparations. The allegation in the Plaint is that the
Defendants have been using an identical mark/deceptively similar mark with an
addition of a word namely, "MULTI CHERRY". The case made out in the Plaint is
that such ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33
::: sng 10 appeal-340,95n387.15 use by the Defendants not only amounts to
infringement of the registered trade marks of the Plaintiffs but results into
a passing off of the Defendants' goods as the goods of the Plaintiffs. It is
claimed that as the Plaintiff is carrying on business in Mumbai, in view of
Section 134 of the Trademarks Act, the Plaintiff is entitled to file the
present suit for infringement within the Original Jurisdiction of this Court.
A prayer is made for grant of leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent for
clubbing the cause of action of passing off with the first cause of action.
11\. In the reply filed by the Defendants to the Petition for grant of leave
under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent, the Defendants have contended that the
suit for infringement as framed is ex facie not maintainable. Secondly, it is
contended that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit based on
cause of action for infringement.
QUESTIONS INVOLVED
12\. The controversy involved in these Appeals is more or less common. The
question is what is the scope of adjudication which is required to be made by
the Court while dealing with the Application/Petition for grant of leave under
Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. The question is whether the defence of the
Defendants to such Application needs to be considered or the Court must
proceed on the ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017
02:41:33 ::: sng 11 appeal-340,95n387.15 basis of the averments made in the
Plaint on the basis of demurer. The third question is when the Plaintiffs
claim that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain one cause of action and
the Defendants claim that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain even the
said cause of action, whether the Court should decide the issue of
jurisdiction whilst deciding the prayer for the grant of Leave under Clause
XIV. The last question will be whether on merits, the learned Single Jude was
justified in granting leave under Clause XIV.
SUMMARY OF SUBMISSIONS
13\. The learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants in these Appeal has
taken us through the pleadings of the parties and the impugned orders. The
learned senior counsel for the Appellants in Appeal No.340 of 2015 has invited
our attention to the averments made in Paragraph 38 and Paragraph 1 of the
Plaint. The learned Counsel contended that the condition precedent for grant
of leave under Clause XIV is that this Court should have the Original
Jurisdiction in respect of one cause of action. He, therefore, submitted that
as this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit seeking action for
infringement of the registered trade mark, the learned Single Judge had no
jurisdiction to grant leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. He relied
upon a decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Gold Seal
Engineering Products Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Hindustan ::: Uploaded on -
07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 12
appeal-340,95n387.15 Manufacturers & Ors. (D.B.)1. The submission is that
there is a difference between the power which the Court exercises while
granting leave under Clause XII and while granting leave under Clause XIV of
the Letters Patent. The contentions raised by the Defendants by way of reply
have to be considered before granting leave. The learned counsel relied upon a
decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Jagdish
Gopal Kamath Vs Lime and Chilli Hospitality Services (P) Ltd.2. He submitted
that the learned Single Judge seems to have applied the principles governing
grant of leave under Clause XII while considering the Application under Clause
XIV. He submitted that Clause XII does not contemplate of giving a notice of
the Application seeking leave under the said Clause. On the other hand, under
Clause XIV, issuance of notice is made mandatory. Therefore, while contesting
the Application seeking leave under Clause XIV, the Defendants can raise all
permissible defences which are required to be considered by the Court. It is
submitted that the Petition seeking leave under Clause XIV of the Letters
Patent cannot be allowed only on the basis of the demurer. He submitted that
if the said view is accepted, the provision regarding giving notice of the
Application seeking leave to the Defendants would become redundant. He relied
upon a decision of this Court in the case of I.C.I.C.I. Limited v. Sri Durga
Bansal Fertilizers Ltd. & Ors. 3.

14\. He submitted that an inquiry while deciding the Petition seeking leave
under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent is not restricted to the averments made
in the Plaint. The inquiry will have to be in terms of the parameters laid
down in the case of Jagdish Gopal Kamath.
15\. It is submitted that while dealing with an Application under Clause XIV
of the Letters Patent, the inquiry must travel beyond the Plaint. Though a
final determination of any issue may not be contemplated at the stage of
consideration of Clause XIV application, yet the inquiry cannot be based
merely on demurer as held by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order.
The submission is that Rule 11 of Order VII of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (for short "the said Code") has nothing to do with the inquiry
contemplated by Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. It was submitted that the
decision of the Division Bench in the case of Tukojirao Holkar v. Sowkabai
Pandharinath Rajapurkar4 will not apply to the facts of the case.
16\. The submission of the learned counsel appearing for the Appellants is
that the Respondents/Plaintiffs are not entitled to invoke jurisdiction of
this Court under Sub-section (2) of Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act.
Reliance is placed on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Indian
Performing Rights Society Limited v. Sanjay 4 AIR 1926 Bombay 100 ::: Uploaded
on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 14
appeal-340,95n387.15 Dalia and Another5. The submission is that Section 134 of
the Trade Marks Act does not give absolute right to the registered proprietors
to drag the Defendants to their choice of jurisdiction and make provisions of
the said Code redundant. He relied upon what is held in paragraphs 12, 17 to
20 and 23 and 24 of the said decision in the case of Indian Performing Rights
Society Limited v. Sanjay Dalia and Another.
17\. It is further contended that only a registered proprietor or a registered
user has a right to sue for infringement and even a permitted user cannot sue
for infringement. Reliance is placed on Section 53 of the Trade Marks Act.
While dealing with the interpretation of the provision of Section 134 of the
Trade Marks Act, reliance is placed on a decision of the Apex Court in the
case of State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Another6. It was
submitted that the finding of the learned Single Judge on interpretation of
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act is erroneous as the first Respondent (first
Plaintiff) who claims to be a registered proprietor admittedly has no office
in Mumbai and the second Respondent is neither registered proprietor nor
registered user and is not entitled to maintain a suit for infringement.
Therefore, Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act could not have been invoked.

18\. Further submission of the learned counsel appearing for the Appellants is
that the reliance placed by the learned Single Judge on the decision in the
case of Exphar Sa Vs. Eupharma Laboratories Ltd. is completely erroneous. The
Apex Court held that when an objection is raised by way of demurer to the
jurisdiction of this Court and not by way of trial, then the Court should
proceed on the basis of the facts pleaded in the Plaint. The other submission
is that some of the observations made in the decision in the case of Exphar Sa
Vs. Eupharma Laboratories Ltd. are no longer valid in the subsequent decision
in the case of Indian Performing Rights Society.
19\. It was further submitted on the basis of the averments made in the Plaint
that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit based on even the
first cause of action. Lastly, it was submitted that grant of leave is always
a discretion of the Court. It was pointed out that the issue of jurisdiction
under Section 9A of the said Code has been already framed, but the same is not
being heard. On facts, it is submitted that the discretion ought to have been
exercised in favour of the Defendants by not granting leave under Clause XIV
of the Letters Patent.

20\. The legal submissions made across the bar in other two Appeals are more
or less similar. Their submission is that the learned Single Judge had ex-
facie no jurisdiction to entertain the suits based on the first cause of
action. In these other two Appeals also, learned counsel appearing for the
Appellants placed reliance on various decisions. Reliance is placed on a
decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Jagdish
Gopal Kamath and Others v. Lime and Chilli Hospitality Services P. Ltd. One of
the submissions canvassed was that when an Application for grant of leave
under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent is opposed by the Defendants by filing
a reply, consideration of facts stated in the reply is necessary. Moreover, it
is necessary to examine whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the
suit based on the first cause of action. The submission is that if ex facie,
the Court has no has jurisdiction to entertain the suit based on the first
cause of action, grant of leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent will be
an abuse of the process of law. The Submission in short is that an Application
for leave under Clause XIV cannot be decided on demurer. The submissions have
been made on facts as to how the leave has been erroneously granted.
21\. The learned counsel appearing for the Respondents/Original Plaintiffs
have also made a detailed submissions. One of the submissions is that even if
the leave is granted under Clause ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded
on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 17 appeal-340,95n387.15 XIV of the Letters
Patent, issue of jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit based on the
first cause of action remains open. If after framing Preliminary Issue, the
Court comes to a conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit
based on the first cause of action, the Plaint will have to be returned. The
learned counsel appearing for the Respondents has also relied upon various
decisions to which we have made a reference in our judgment. The learned
Counsel have justified the the findings recorded in the impugned order.
CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS
22\. The first issue which arises for consideration is regarding the scope of
adjudication while dealing with an application/petition for grant of leave
under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. For that purpose, it is necessary to
refer to Clause XIV of the Letters Patent, which reads thus:
> "XIV. Joinder of several causes of action.- And We do further ordain that
> where plaintiff has several causes of action against a defendant, such
> causes of action not being for land or other immovable property, and the
> said High Court shall have original jurisdiction in respect of one of such
> causes of action, it shall be lawful for the said High Court to call on the
> defendant to show cause why the several causes of action should not be
> joined together in one suit, and to make such order for trial of the same as
> to the said High Court shall seem fit."

> 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 18 appeal-340,95n387.15
23\. Clause XIV of the Letters Patent has to be compared with Clause XII of
the Letters Patent, which reads thus:
> "XII. Original jurisdiction as to suits.- And we do further ordain that the
> said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal [Madras] [Bombay],
> in the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, shall be
> empowered to receive, try and determine suits of every description if, in
> the case of suits for land or other immovable property, such land or
> property shall be situated or in all other cases if the cause of action
> shall have arisen, either wholly, or, in case the leave of the Court shall

> Court shall not have such Original Jurisdictionin cases falling within the
> jurisdiction of the Small Cause Court at [Madras], [Bombay], Calcutta, in
> which the debt or damage or value of the property sued for, does not exceed
> on hundred rupees."
24\. A leave under Clause XII of the Letters Patent is required to be granted
before a suit is registered. Therefore, there is no requirement of giving a
notice of an Application seeking a leave under Clause XII of the Letters
Patent to the Defendant. However, the Defendant can always apply for
revocation of the leave. As far as an application seeking leave under Clause
XIV is concerned, before grant of leave, there is a mandatory requirement of
issuing a show cause notice to the Defendant and consequently of hearing the
Defendant. The very fact that the Clause XIV of the Letters Patent provides
for issuing a notice to ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on -
08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 19 appeal-340,95n387.15 the Defendant shows that
the Defendants have a right of hearing before the leave is granted.
25\. In view of the language used by Clause XIV of the Letters Patent, if the
Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit based on one cause of action,
only in that case, the question of grant of leave for clubbing another cause
of action arises. If a Defendant contends that the Court has no jurisdiction
to entertain the suit based on the first cause of action, the question is
whether a final adjudication on the said issue can be made at the time of
hearing of the Application under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent.
26\. In a Civil Suit, the issue of jurisdiction can be decided only in the
following manner:-
> (a) When at the time of hearing of an Application for grant of or setting
> aside an order of granting any interim relief whether by way of temporary
> injunction, appointment of a Court Receiver or otherwise, an objection to

The final adjudication on the issue of jurisdiction of the Court to entertain
the suit at that stage is not permissible. In a given case, after noticing at
the final hearing of the Petition seeking a leave under Clause XIV of the
Letters Patent that one of the grounds under Rule 11 of Order VII of the said
Code is attracted, the Court can very well take up for consideration the
question whether the Plaint deserves to be rejected. The reason is that for
considering the issue of rejection of the Plaint only the averments made in
the Plaint are required to be seen and not the averments made in the Written
Statement or other pleadings. Therefore, it follows that when a contention of
lack of jurisdiction of this Court to hear the suit based on the first cause
of action is raised at the time of hearing of the Petition for grant of a
leave under Clause XIV, the issue cannot be decided at that stage. Even if
eventually a leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent is granted, the
issue of ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33
::: sng 22 appeal-340,95n387.15 jurisdiction always remains open. The grant of
leave does not conclude the issue of jurisdiction. The issue of jurisdiction
can be decided at an appropriate stage. If the Court holds that it did not
have jurisdiction to entertain the suit based on the first cause of action,
either the suit will have to be dismissed or the Plaint will have to be
returned, depending upon the facts of the case.
28\. Now, we deal with the second question as regards the scope of
adjudication of the Petition seeking a leave under Clause XII of the Letters
Patent. Various decisions have been relied upon by learned counsel appearing
for the parties. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of I.C.I.C.I.
Limited v. Sri Durga Bansal Fertilizers Ltd. & Ors. was dealing with an issue
of jurisdiction raised in the Chamber Summons taken out for revoking leave
granted under Clause XII of the Letters Patent. In Paragraph 10, the Division
Bench held thus:
> "10. Under these circumstances, we are of the considered view that when
> question about the territorial jurisdiction is raised either in an
> application seeking revocation of leave under Clause XII of the Letters
> Patent or on an application under section of the Code of Civil Procedure,
> the appropriate procedure to follow is to finally decide the said question

> so require, to lead evidence. Such a course would avoid multiplicity of
> proceedings and would also be in consonance with the provisions of section
> and/or Order XIV, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Clause XII of
> the Letters Patent. It would also avoid examination of the same question

> not forthcoming from the defendants."
> This decision is confined to Clause XII of the Letters Patent.
29\. There is an old decision of this Court in the case of Tukojirao Holkar v.
Sowkabai Pandharinath Rajapurka. The said decision was dealing with the issue
of grant of leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. The view taken by
the Division Bench is that after a leave under Clause XIV of the Letters
Patent is granted, it is open for the Defendant at the trial to raise a plea
of want of jurisdiction. Another decision of a Division Bench of this Court is
in the case of M/s.Arte Indiana v. M/s. P.Mittulaul Lalah & Sons & Ors. 7 In
Paragraph 3 of the said decision, while dealing with Clause XIV of the Letters
Patent, the Division Bench observed thus:
> "3. ...A bare reading of the aforesaid clause shows that the accrual of the
> cause of action within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court is not
> contemplated to permit joinder of causes of action. Clause 14 only
> contemplate that this Court shall have Original Jurisdiction in respect of

                                   Letters Patent is a discretionary exercise;

32\. As we have observed earlier, when a reply is filed to the Petition
seeking leave under clause XIV of the Letters Patent, the Petition seeking
leave under clause XIV of the Letters Patent cannot be decided on mere demurer
and the Court will have to take into consideration the reply filed to the
Petition seeking a leave under clause XIV of the Letters Patent. We may hasten
to add here that while dealing with the Petition under clause XIV of the
Letters Patent, the Court is not expected to record a final finding on the
issue of jurisdiction or maintainability of the suit based on the first cause
of action except when the Court exercises the power under Rule 11 of Order VII
of the said Code. When the power of rejection of the Plaint is exercised,
naturally, there will be no occasion to grant a leave under clause XIV of the
Letters Patent. The learned Single Judge in the decision in the case of
Jagdish Gopal Kamath Vs Lime and Chilli Hospitality Services (P) Ltd. has
rightly held that the inquiry on the question whether the ::: Uploaded on -
07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 28
appeal-340,95n387.15 Plaintiff is entitled to grant of leave has to be minimal
and the hearing of such Petitions cannot be allowed to be converted into
hearing of interlocutory hearings.
33\. In addition to what we have held in the judgment, we agree with the
summary of the conclusions recorded by the learned Single Judge in Paragraph
16 of the decision in the case of Jagdish Gopal Kamath Vs Lime and Chilli
Hospitality Services (P) Ltd. After having perused all the decisions relied
upon by the parties, we find that none of the binding decisions take a view
which is contrary to the view taken by us.
SCOPE OF APPEAL
34\. There are submissions canvassed across the bar on merits of the impugned
orders. We have held earlier that clause XIV of the Letters Patent confers
discretionary power on the Court. The grant of leave under clause XIV of the
Letters Patent is a discretionary exercise. An Appeal against an order passed
in exercise of the discretionary power can be said to be an Appeal on
principle. Unless it is shown that the exercise of discretion is perverse or
is completely contrary to the settled law, in normal course, the Appeal Court
should not interfere with the exercise of discretion. Even if leave is granted
by rejecting ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017
02:41:33 ::: sng 29 appeal-340,95n387.15 contentions raised by the Defendants,
there is no final adjudication made on merits of the suit or the issue of
Jurisdiction. Moreover, the limited adjudication made while granting leave
will not affect the decision of the Court on the interlocutory applications
for grant of interim relief. The issue of jurisdiction of the Court to
entertain the suit always remains open even if a leave is granted under clause
XIV of the Letters Patent. Even if leave is refused, rights of the Plaintiff
are not affected in the sense that he can bring a separate suit before the
appropriate forum on the cause of action sought to be clubbed by taking
recourse to Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. When an Appeal is preferred
against the order passed on a Petition seeking leave under clause XIV of the
Letters Patent, the Appeal Court will have to bear in mind the aforesaid
aspects. It is in the light of these parameters, now we proceed to discuss the
merits of the impugned orders.
ON MERITS OF THE IMPUGNED ORDER
35\. Now coming to the merits of the Appeal No.95 of 2015, the Plaintiff
claims to be a registered Proprietor of a "CHERI" (in Class 5) in respect of
pharmaceutical preparations. According to the case of the Plaintiff, it
carries on business in Mumbai and its goods are available in Mumbai. The suit
is filed for infringement of the registered trade mark by contending that by
virtue of Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 30 appeal-340,95n387.15 1999, the
Plaintiff is entitled to file a suit within the jurisdiction of this Court. It
was contended that the cause of action also arises for action of passing off
and, therefore, leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent was sought for
combining the causes of action.
36\. The Defendants contended that the cause of action for infringement had
not arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court. Another contention was that
the suit for infringement was not maintainable. In Paragraph 5 of the order,
the learned Single Judge has adverted to Sub-section (2) of Section 134 of the
Trade Marks Act and observed that a registered proprietor of a trademark can
institute a suit for infringement in a Court within the local limits of whose
jurisdiction at the time of institution of the suit, the registered proprietor
actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for
gain. The learned Single Judge referred to the case made out in the Plaint
that the Plaintiff is carrying on business in Mumbai and its goods are
available in Mumbai. The finding recorded in Paragraph 5 of the order is not a
final finding on the issue of jurisdiction. It is only a tentative finding
recorded while dealing with the contention raised by the Defendants. There is
no perversity in the finding. In Paragraph 6 of the order, the learned Single
Judge has considered the submissions made by the Defendants that the
Plaintiff's registration is restricted merely to pharmaceutical preparations
which does not cover the case in relation ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 31 appeal-340,95n387.15 to which
the Defendants use their alleged offending mark. Perhaps, the objection of the
Appellant was to the following observations made in Paragraph 6 in the
impugned order.
> "6. ...The requirement, however, is that the Court must be in a position to
> arrive at the conclusion that the suit as framed is not maintainable without
> there being any need to consider any defence to the suit."
37\. However, in the further part of the order, the learned Single Judge has
observed that whether the goods in respect of which the Defendants use their
mark, are pharmaceutical preparations or is not free from doubt. The learned
Single Judge further observed that the documents placed on record by the
defendants along with the reply cannot be taken into consideration. To that
extent, the learned Judge may not be right, but he has held that the issue
whether the goods in respect of which the Defendants use their mark are
pharmaceutical preparations is not free from doubt. Therefore, we do not find
that the discretion exercised while granting leave is not perverse. He held
that it cannot be said that the suit is ex-facie not maintainable.
38\. In Appeal No.340 of 2015, the facts of the case have been already
narrated in the earlier part of the judgment. The opposition of the Defendants
to the Petition seeking a leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent is on
the ground that the first Plaintiff was owner of the ::: Uploaded on -
07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 32
appeal-340,95n387.15 registered trademark which carries on business outside
the jurisdiction of this Court. There is nothing placed on record to establish
that the first Plaintiff has authorized the second Plaintiff to use its
trademark. The contention was that under Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act,
it was not enough to prove that the second Plaintiff was a distributor of the
goods marketed by the first Plaintiff in India. It was contended that merely
because the distributor was having its office within the jurisdiction of this
Court, it cannot be said that the Court had jurisdiction to entertain an
infringement action. It was pointed out that the preliminary issue of
jurisdiction has been already framed. The learned Single Judge observed that
for the purposes of application for grant of leave under Clause XIV of the
Letters Patent, the Court will have to proceed on the footing that the second
Plaintiff was a distributor and agent of the first Plaintiff. The learned
Single Judge relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Ultratech
Cement Ltd. v. Dalmia Cement Bharat Limited which in turn relies upon the
decision of the Apex Court in the case of Exphar Sa Vs. Eupharma Laboratories
Ltd.
39\. The case made out in the Plaint and in the Petition for grant of leave by
the Plaintiffs was that the second Plaintiff was having its office at Mumbai.
It was pleaded that the second Plaintiff was carrying on business in Mumbai as
the exclusive and sole distributor of ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 :::
Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 33 appeal-340,95n387.15 the first
Plaintiff to use the goods. All this is a matter of evidence and in fact, a
preliminary issue of jurisdiction of this Court has been already framed. Even
in this case, there is no final finding recorded by the learned Single Judge
on the issue of jurisdiction which remains at large notwithstanding the grant
of leave under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent. Therefore, we find no
perversity or illegality in the approach adopted by the learned Single Judge.
40\. Now we turn to the Appeal No.387 of 2015 which arises out of Suit No.42
of 2014 (Ultratech Cement Limited and Another v. Dalmia Cement Bharat
Limited). The case made out in the Plaint was that the first Plaintiff was a
registered proprietor of the trade marks listed at Sr.Nos.2 to 7 whilst the
second Plaintiff is a registered proprietor of the trade marks listed at
Sr.Nos.1, 8 and 9. All these trade marks contain the word "Ultratech" or
"Ultra" as a part of them. It is alleged that by the Deed of Assignment dated
30 th September 2009, the trade marks containing the word "Ultratech" or
"Ultra" was assigned to the second Plaintiff alongwith the goodwill of the
business. Reliance is also placed on the License Agreement dated 29 th June
2011. By the said License Agreement, the second Plaintiff has permitted the
first Plaintiff to use the trade marks containing the word "UltraTech" or
"Ultra". It is alleged that the words "Ultra" and "Tech" are the essential and
prominent features of the registered mark bearing the word ::: Uploaded on -
07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 34
appeal-340,95n387.15 "UltraTech". It was alleged that the Defendant/Appellant
has started using a mark containing the word "Ultra" and that the trade mark
of the Defendant is identical with or deceptively similar to the "UltraTech"
trademark and, therefore, such user by the Defendant will amount to an
infringement of the "UltraTech" trade marks. The objection of the Defendant
was that this Court had no jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action for
infringement as only a registered proprietor or a registered user can maintain
a suit for infringement. It was contended that the second Plaintiff cannot
maintain a suit containing action for infringement under Sub-section (2) of
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act since it cannot be said to be ordinarily
residing or carrying on business within the jurisdiction of this Court. In
this case, the Defendant had applied under Order VII Rule 11 of the said Code
on the ground that only the second Plaintiff cannot file a suit for
infringement as a registered proprietor of the trademark and that the
principal place of its business was outside the jurisdiction of this Court.
While dismissing the prayer for rejection of the Plaint, the learned Single
Judge held that the Court would have jurisdiction to entertain a suit under
Sub-section (2) of Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act even if the Plaintiff
only had its subordinate office and not its principal office within the
jurisdiction of this Court. In this case, the second Plaintiff has a
subordinate office within the jurisdiction of this Court. An Appeal against
the said order of rejection of the Application for rejection of the :::
Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 08/08/2017 02:41:33 ::: sng 35
appeal-340,95n387.15 Plaint was dismissed by the Division Bench by granting
liberty to the Defendant to take out appropriate proceedings including an
application under Section 9A of the said Code. In our view, while dealing with
the Petition under Clause XIV of the Letters Patent, in view of the earlier
order of the learned Single Judge which was confirmed in Appeal, it was not
necessary for the learned Single Judge to go into the prima facie
consideration of the issue whether the suit was maintainable under Sub-section
(2) of Section 134 of the Trade Mark Act. Nevertheless, the learned Single
Judge has dealt with the same and negatived it. Prima facie view expressed by
the learned Single Judge is that there was no need to read words in the nature
of the explanation to Section 20 in Sub-section (2) of Section 134 of the
Trade Marks Act. According to us, the learned Single Judge has considered the
defence of the Defendant to the leave application and has held more than
minimal inquiry and has recorded a prima facie finding that this Court had
jurisdiction to entertain the suit containing the cause of action for
infringement. We do not find any perversity attached to the approach or
findings recorded by the learned Single Judge.
41\. In none of the aforesaid three Petitions, there is material to come to a
conclusion that the action of filing a suit in this Court is malafide or that
undue hardship will be caused to the Defendants if the leave under Clause XIV
of the Letters Patent is granted. ::: Uploaded on - 07/08/2017 ::: Downloaded
