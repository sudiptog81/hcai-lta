discussion, I come to conclusion that the impugned order does not require

    (By Sri. Mohammed Mujassim, Advocate, for
        Sri. R.Vidyasagar, Advocate for C/R)
          This MFA is filed under Section 43 Rule 1(r) of CPC
    against the order dated 15.09.2018 passed on I.A.No.I in
                                   2
    O.S.No.5291/2018, on the file of the XVI Additional City
    Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City (CCH-12) allowing
    the I.A.No.I filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with
    Section 151 of CPC.
           This MFA coming on for admission this day, the court
    delivered the following:
                           JUDGMENT
The defendant in O.S.5291/2018 on the file of Additional City Civil and
Sessions Judge (CH.12), Bengaluru, has filed this appeal aggrieved by the
order passed on an application filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC by the
plaintiff.
2\. The respondent being the plaintiff in the suit has pleaded that it is a
direct selling entity. It is marketing four products by name I-Coffee,
I-Pulse, I- Slim and I-Charge manufactured by M/s Olive Life Sciences Private
Limited. It came to know that the defendant without its consent was
soliciting/advertising/exhibiting/offering/endorsing its products below
maximum retail price and thus causing  3 loss to it. Immediately the plaintiff
contacted the defendant through E-mails and lodged complaints. It requested
the defendant to stop selling its products. Since the defendant did not stop,
the plaintiff caused a legal notice issued to the defendant on 19.6.2018 and
sought removal of its products from the defendant's web site. The defendant
did not stop and failed to comply with the demand of the plaintiff and hence
the plaintiff brought a suit against the defendant seeking the relief of
permanent injunction restraining the defendant from
soliciting/advertising/exhibiting/offering /endorsing for sale or trade,
release of its products. Along with the plaint, the plaintiff also made an
application for temporary injunction. The said application stood allowed on
15.9.2018. Hence, this appeal.
3\. The stand of the defendant is that it is a intermediary as defined under
section 2 (1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. It only provides a
4 platform for the buyers and the sellers and it does not actively participate
in the transactions that take place on its platform. It does not manufacture,
procure, list, price or sell the products made available on its on-line market
price. Section 79 of the Information Technology creates a safe harbour for
intermediaries from liability for the illegal and/or infringing activities
carried out by third parties on its websites. It is not aware that the
products I-Coffee, I-Pulse, I-Slim or I-Charge belong to the plaintiff
company. An intermediary is only obligated to act against illegal and/or
infringing contents once it receives actual knowledge that such content is
illegal or infringing. 'Actual knowledge' means knowledge by means of a court
order and therefore it was not obligated to act on plaintiff's e-mails and
notices dated 19.6.2018. Thus, there cannot be an order of injunction against
it.
5
4\. For granting an order of temporary injunction against the
defendant/appellant, the trial court has recorded the following findings : -
> (a) It is admitted that the plaintiff's products are registered in the
> defendant's website for sale.
> The defendant has not obtained consent from the plaintiff.
> (b) Despite request made by the plaintiff and even after issuance of legal
> notice, the defendant did not remove the plaintiff's products from its
> website and it failed to take necessary action.
(c) The defendant has contended that it is an intermediary and section 79 of
the Information Technology Act provides a safe harbour from liability arising
due to illegal and infringing activities carried on by the third parties. This
stand cannot be accepted  6 because after coming to know about hosting of
infringing information, the defendant should have removed it. It is held by
the High Court of Delhi in the case of Kent RO Systems Limited and Another vs
Amit Kotak and Others [2017 SCC Online Delhi 7201] that the intermediaries
have to be vigilant and should declare to all its users, its policies and
advice them not to host any infringing information on the website of the
intermediary. Therefore, the defendant should have been diligent before sale
of the infringing products and only in that event protection under section 79
of the Act will be available. Even Rule 3 of the Information Technology
(Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 requires the intermediary to be
diligent while discharging its duties to host the information on its website.
It is not the case of the  7 defendant that it has adhered to Rule 3 of the
Rules.
(d) Even clause 7(6) of the model guidelines issued by the Ministry of
Consumer Affairs, Government of India, specifies that a person who sells or
offers for sale including on e-
commerce platform/market place, any product or service of a direct selling
entry must have prior written consent from the respective direct selling
entity in order to undertake or solicit such sale or offer. Though such
guidelines cannot be called in strict sense a law, it is advisory in nature
and therefore the defendants should have followed it.
(e) The defendant having failed to comply with these requirements cannot sell
the plaintiffs products and therefore the plaintiff is justified in
complaining against the defendant  8 and thus the plaintiff becomes entitled
to an order of temporary injunction.
5\. The learned counsel for the appellant argues that it cannot sit in
judgment with regard to transactions being made on its platform. The defendant
cannot say whether those transactions are legal or illegal. There are
seventeen million users on its platform and it is impossible for the appellant
to identify as to who is selling the plaintiff's products through its
platform. Appellant is just an intermediary. Section 79 of the Act gives
protection to it. Person who is actually using the appellant's platform for
selling the plaintiff's product must be a party to the suit. If the plaintiff
obtains an injunction against that person, the appellant will remove the
plaintiff's products from its website. It may be true that the plaintiff sent
communication to the appellant to stop hosting its products, but according to
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Shreya  9 Singhal vs Union of
India [[Manu/SC/0329/SC-2015], knowledge means only knowledge through a court
order and therefore any communication made by the plaintiff to the appellant
cannot be considered as knowledge on the part of appellant to hold it liable
if at all plaintiff's products are being sold on its platform.
5.1. It is his further argument that the guidelines that the trial court has
referred to has no force of law. They need not be followed. In this context he
refers to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of G.J.Fernandez Vs.
State of Mysore & others [(1967) 3 SCC 636] and Syndicate Bank Vs.
Ramachandran Pillai and others [(2011) 15 SCC 398]. Therefore, it is his
argument that the trial court should not have granted an order of temporary
injunction against the appellant. The plaintiff has not made out prima facie
case.
10
6\. The counsel for the respondent/plaintiff has argued that the appellant
cannot take a defiant stand having admitted the sale of the plaintiff's
products through its platform. The appellant is not an intermediary to seek
protection under section 79 of the Act. Actually the defendant is selling the
plaintiff's products as its own. The appellant raises the bills in its name.
It uses its own packing and giving logistic support. The appellant is
answerable to the end user. Therefore, the appellant cannot call itself an
intermediary.
6.1. The respondent/plaintiff issued notice to the appellant to stop hosting
its products on its web site. At that point of time nothing prevented the
appellant from disclosing the name of the person or the agency using its
platform for sale of the plaintiff's products. The appellant cannot say that
it cannot identify the seller of plaintiff products. The appellant has taken
an  11 adamant stand that it need not filter the contents of its users. There
is a clear violation of the guidelines. The appellant has not taken consent
from the plaintiff. He refers to the judgment of the High Court of Delhi in
Amway India Enterprises Private Limited vs IMG Technologies Private Limited
and Another [CS (OS) 410/2018 decided on 8.7.2019] to argue that in a
circumstance pleaded by the plaintiff, the High Court of Delhi rejected the
stand of an intermediary. He argues that the trial court is justified in
granting an order of injunction. When the discretion is properly exercised by
the trial court, there is no ground for interfering with that order and
therefore appeal should be dismissed.
7\. Before dealing with the points of arguments, it needs to be mentioned here
that in an appeal preferred challenging an order passed on application under
Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of Civil Procedure Code, what is required to be examined
is whether the court has exercised the  12 discretion properly or not either
for granting or refusing to grant an order of temporary injunction. If it
appears that discretion is exercised properly by considering the materials
placed before the court, there cannot be any interference with the order
challenged. If on the basis of the materials, two views are possible to be
taken and if the appellate court finds that the trial court could have taken,
another view, there cannot be interference with the order under challenge.
8\. Now in the present case the appellant claims protection under Section 79
of the Act. It claims to be an intermediary. It does not dispute plaintiff's
products being sold on its platform. It also does not dispute having received
e-mail communication and legal notice from the plaintiff/respondent. But it
takes a stand that such communication is not a knowledge attributable to it
for stopping sale of plaintiff's products. Reliance is placed on the decision
of the Supreme Court in the case  13 of Shreya Singhal (supra). I do not think
that the appellant can take shelter under this decision. In Shreya Singhal
(supra), the constitutional validity of Sections 66A and 79 of the Act in the
touchstone or Article 19(2) of the constitution was examined. While holding
that Section 66A is violative of Article 19(2), Section 79 is held to be valid
subject to Section 79(3)(b) which has been read down to mean actual knowledge
attributable to an intermediary as upon a court order or issuance of
notification by appropriate government or its agency. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court has taken this view in relation to transmission of matters that are
being used for committing unlawful acts. Here is a case where the plaintiff
complains of its products being sold by the defendant either directly or on
its platform. The plaintiff's case is that of infringement of its commercial
right. Therefore the appellant cannot remain oblivious to plaintiff's
requests. No sooner it received communication from the plaintiff than it
should have  14 stopped trading plaintiff's products or disclosed the name of
the person or agency using its platform for trading plaintiff's products.
Probably, the plaintiff could have sued the actual person using the
appellants' platform had such person's name been disclosed by the appellant.
It's stand that it cannot filter the contents of its users is difficult to be
accepted when it is getting revenue by the user of its platform.
9\. The appellant's counsel has relied upon the judgment of the High Court of
Delhi in the case of Myspace Inc Vs. Super Cassettes Industries Ltd.(2016 SCC
Online Del. 6382). This judgment is of no avail to appellant. In this decision
what is complained of is infringement of copy right by users of social media
on the platform of an intermediary namely "My Space". In fact in para 63 of
the judgment, it is observed by the High Court of Delhi that if the host has
specific knowledge that the transmitted content is  15 unlawful, then no safe
harbour can be urged. Therefore the appellant's contention that it can claim
protection under Section 79 of Act cannot be accepted.
10\. The trial court has held that Rule 3 of the Information Technology
(Intermediaries Guide Lines) Rules and Clause 7(6) of the model guidelines
issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India are
applicable. It is argued by appellants counsel that so far the guidelines
issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs are concerned, they do not have
force of law and they need not be followed and in this context he has placed
reliance on two judgments of the Supreme Court in the case of G.J. Fernandez
Vs. State of Mysore & others (supra) and Syndicate Bank vs Ramachandra Pillai
and others (supra). These decisions, in my opinion, do not render any help to
appellant to contend that it is not bound by the guidelines. On the contrary,
the respondent's  16 counsel has referred to the judgment of High Court of
Delhi in the case of Amway India Enterprises Pvt Ltd Vs. 1MG Technologies Pvt.
Ltd & another (supra). In this decision, it is held as below.
> "304. The question as to how the platforms are providing the value-added
> services and whether they are performing an active role in the same, would
> have to be finally adjudicated at trial. However, the bare minimum that they
> would be required to do to avail the exemption under Section 79(2)(c), would

11\. It is argued by the counsel for respondent that the appellant is not an
intermediary as it issues bill for the products in its name besides providing
logistic support etc., If this were to be the situation, the appellant cannot
claim protection under Section 79 of the Act also. Therefore with the
discussion, I come to conclusion that the impugned order does not require
interference. I find discretionary power being exercised properly. Even if
grounds urged by appellant can be said to tenable and another view being
possible to be taken, it cannot be the reasons for upsetting the impugned
order. Therefore appeal is dismissed.
