the draft assessment order, is illegal and bad in law.

Act.
4 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
4.1. That the Assessing Officer has erred in law, on facts and in the

claim of the appellant that sales tax incentive/ subsidy amounting to
Rs.7,03,81,097/- represented capital receipt not liable to tax under the
provisions of the Act.

sales tax subsidy received by the appellant was not capital receipt but
taxable revenue receipt under section 28(iv) of the Act.
5 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
6.2. That the Assessing Officer failed to appreciate that identical issue was
decided in favour of the appellant both by the CIT(A) and the ITAT in

6.3 That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that since the object of subsidy was to promote industrial growth/
development, to generate employment, etc., the subsidy so received was in the
nature of capital receipt not liable to tax under the provisions of the Act.

that the fact that appellant is a cash rich company or that the appellant was
granted subsidy under prestigious unit category or that the appellant could
utilize the subsidy amount without any pre-restricted object, had no bearing
on deciding the issue in question.

the Memorandum dated 18.10.01 issued by the Prohibition, Excise and Taxation

certificate as capital subsidy.
7.0. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in disallowing
expenditure of Rs. 679,11.80,556/- incurred on account of royalty, both
lumpsum and running, holding the same to be capital expenditure.

that royalty paid by the appellant to Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan
(hereinafter referred to as "SMC") is merely for the right and license to
manufacture and sell the licensed product for a specified duration in India
and was therefore, revenue in nature.
7.2. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that payment of royalty is directly linked and correlated with the
production/sales of cars and spares by the appellant and if there is no
production/sale of cars and spares, there will be o royalty payable to SMC.
7.3 That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that royalty payment (including cess) was held to be revenue expenditure in
all the preceding assessment years till assessment year 2005-06 and that there
being no change in facts during the year under consideration, there was no
warrant or justification to take a totally contradictory view in holding the
same to be capital expenditure.
7.4. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in disallowing Rs.
6 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
32,03,13,445/-on account of R&D cess on royalty, holding that cess also
partook the character of royalty, without appreciating that royalty was paid
to SMC whereas R&D cess on royalty, being a statutory payment, was paid to the
Indian Government.
7.5. That the Assessing Officer erred in failing to appreciate that R&D cess,
being a statutory payment, is governed by section 43B of the Act, which is a
separate code in itself and overrides other provisions of the Act, and hence
the payment of R&D cess is an allowable deduction under that section.
7.6. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that R&D cess on royalty was always accepted to be revenue expenditure in all
the previous assessments till assessment year 2005-06, and that there being no
change in facts during the year under consideration, there was no warrant or
justification to take a totally contradictory view and holding the same to be
capital expenditure.
7.7. Without prejudice, the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not
appreciating that the appellant had suo-moto disallowed R&D cess paid on
royalty to the extent of Rs. 52,84,893/- under section 43B , thereby resulting
in a double disallowance to the extent of Rs. 52,84,893/-.
8.0. That the Assessing Officer has erred in law and on facts in disallowing
deduction of Rs.67,00,000/- representing the excise duty paid by the appellant
during the relevant previous year.
8.1. That the Assessing Officer failed to appreciate that the said amount of
Rs.67,00,000/- constituted and represented excise duty actually paid by the
appellant and is, therefore, allowable deduction under section 43 B of the
Act.
8.2. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in leveling false
and baseless allegations of the appellant having, inter alia, hidden true
nature of payment of excise duty.
9.0 That the Assessing Officer has erred on facts and in law in making
disallowance of Rs.36,38,43,197/- being the expenditure provided on estimated
basis on account of foreseen price increase (in short "FPI"), disregarding the
consistent and accepted method followed by the appellant for last many years
since inception.
9.1. That the Assessing Officer completely failed to appreciate that there was
a clear contractual agreement/ understanding between appellant and suppliers
7 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 under which the appellant was liable to pay additional
amount of price for the supplies of various inputs received during the year
and accordingly the said liability accrued during or before the end of that
year and estimated amount thereof was accordingly allowable as deduction from
assessable income.
9.2. That theAssessing officerfailed to appreciate that mere fact that the
exact amount of additional price payable to suppliers was not quantified until
the end of relevant accounting year did not at all mean that there was no
accrual of liability in that year.
9.3. That the Assessing officercompletely disregarded the evidence and
material placed on record which conclusively establishes the existence of
agreement/understanding between appellant and suppliers for the payment of
additional price to them for supplies made during the accounting year ended on
31st March, 2009.
9.4. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not taking
cognizance of the fact that the entire amount of liability has either been
paid or written back and offered to tax as its income in the succeeding
assessment year.
9.5. Without prejudice, the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in not
allowing the deduction of the amount disallowed in the preceding assessment
year(s) but actually paid during the year under consideration.
10.0. That the Assessing Officer has erred in law, on facts and in the
circumstances of the case in making ad-hoc disallowance of Rs. 17,29,22,979/-
for alleged sharing of resources by the appellant with other group /
subsidiary companies.
10.1. That the assessing officer / DRP erred in observing that the appellant
had borne expenses incurred for other corporate entities, failing to
appreciate that the entire expenses were incurred by the appellant for the
purposes of its business and hence no part of the expenditure incurred was
required to be disallowed on account of sharing of resources.
10.2. That the assessing officer/ DRP further failed to appreciate that the
disallowance of any part of the expenses incurred is ultimately tax neutral in
as much as the expenses disallowed in the hands of the appellant would have to
be allowed in the hands of the group/ subsidiary companies.
10.3. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, the quantum of disallowance computed
by the Assessing Officer is very high as compared to expenses that could, if
at all, reasonably attributed towards sharing of expenses.
8 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
11.0 That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in disallowing
Rs.7.67.00.000-. being the expenditure incurred on account of discharging
corporate social responsibility}. without appreciating that such expenditure
was incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of business.
11.1. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in holding that the
expenditure incurred on corporate social responsibility is, even otherwise,
capital in nature on the ground that the same resulted in enduring benefit to
the appellant.
11.2. Without prejudice, the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in
not allowing depreciation under section 32 of the Act, consistent with his
finding that the aforesaid expenditure is capital in nature.
12.0. That the assessing officer has erred on facts and in law in disallowing
a sum of Rs.6,41,060/-, being expenditure incurred on account of club
membership fees, following the assessment orders for the earlier years,
alleging that the appellant failed to justify the said expenses.
13\. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in making addition
to the income of the appellant to the extent of Rs. 447.73 Crores on account
of the alleged difference in the arm's length price of international
transactions.
14\. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in adopting a
completely contradictory position of accepting Transactional Net Margin Method
('TNMM') as the most appropriate method on the one hand, and yet seeking to
question appropriateness of individual elements of operating cost on the
other, thereby failing to appreciate fundamental TP principles.
15\. That the assessing officer/TPO erred on facts and in law in making
transfer pricing adjustment amounting to Rs. 136,00,00,000/- in relation to
the advertisement, marketing and sales promotion expenses (hereinafter
referred to as "the AMP expenses') incurred by the appellant.
15.1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the DRP erred
in law in upholding, in principle, transfer pricing adjustment made by the
assessing officer / TPO in respect of expenditure incurred on advertising,
marketing and publicity ("AMP expenses'')?
15.2. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the only
Transfer Pricing adjustment permitted by Chapter X of the Act was in respect
of the difference between the arm's length price (ALP) and the contract or
declared  9 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 price but it cannot determine the 'quantum'
of the international transaction or extent of business expenditure.
15.3. The DRP erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the Transfer
Pricing adjustment sought to be made by the TPO in the present case was a mere
quantitative adjustment, on the footing that the Appellant had incurred an
excessive amount of AMP expenditure , and not on the footing that there was a
difference between the ALP and the contract or declared price, and that a
Transfer Pricing adjustment was not at all permitted or authorized by Chapter
X of the Act.
15.4. The DRP erred on facts and in law in not holding that merely because the
Indian company has incurred expenditure on product advertisements including
the foreign brand and the AMP expenses incurred by the taxpayer which are
proportionately higher than those incurred by comparable cases, it does not
lead to the inference of "transaction" between the taxpayer and the foreign AE
for creating marketing intangibles on behalf of the later.
15.5. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in holding that expenditure
incurred by the appellant which incidentally resulted in brand building for
the foreign AE, was a transaction of creating and improving marketing
intangibles for and on behalf of its foreign AE and further that such a
transaction was in the nature of provision of a service by the appellant to
the AE.
15.6. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that the characterization of the appellant being that of a full fledged
manufacturer and the sole beneficiary of the AMP expenditure incurred by it,
justifies the conduct of the appellant in incurring and bearing the cost of
AMP expenditure.
15.7. The DRP erred on facts and in law in not holding that expenditure on
advertisement and brand promotion, unilaterally incurred by the appellant,
could not be regarded as a 'transaction' in the absence of any proved
understanding / arrangement between the appellant and the associated
enterprise.
15.8. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the AMP
expenses, etc., unilaterally incurred by the appellant in India could not be
characterized as an international transaction as per section 92B,in the
absence of any proved understanding / arrangement between the appellant and
the associated enterprise, so as to invoke the provisions of section 92 of the
Act.
15.9. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that in  10
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 absence of any understanding / arrangement between the
appellant and the associated enterprise, the associated enterprise was under
no obligation to reimburse AMP expenses incurred by the appellant for sale of
its products in India.
15.10. The DRP TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the
advertisement and marketing expenses were incurred by the appellant wholly and
exclusively for purposes of its business and not on behalf of or for the
benefit of the AE: any benefit to the AE being only incidental.
15.11 That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that the joint trade mark ''Maruti-Suzuki" is exclusively used by the assessee
and AE (SMC) does not have any right to use/sell products under the joint
trademark "Maruti-Suzuki"
15.12. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not
appreciating that the AMP expenses ,etc, unilaterally incurred by the
appellant in India cannot be characterized as an international transaction as
per section 92B so as to invoke the provisions of section 92 of the Act.
15.13. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciate
the A&M expenses incurred by the Assessee were towards the products
manufactured and owned by the Assessee and not towards the brand, per se
(Joint Brand);
15.14. Withoutprejudice to the all other grounds, AOfailed to appreciate that
full disallowance of excessive A&M expenditure is not appropriate as the
excessive expenditure will lead to Brand building of both Maruti and Suzuki.
That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in holding that the
appellant incurred extra-ordinary / non routine expenses of promotion and
development of Suzuki brand and, therefore, helped in creation of marketing
intangible in India.
15.15. That theassessing officer erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that the AMP expensesincurred by the appellant, did not result in creation of
any marketing intangibles; much less on account of the AE.
15.16. Without prejudice that the assessing officer erred on facts and in law
in ignoring the fact that, since the appellant earns return commensurate with
other brand owners, the appellant is adequately compensated for its functions
and AMP expenses.
15.17. Without prejudice that the assessing officer erred on facts and in law,
in not appreciating that the AMP expenses incurred by the appellant was
appropriately established to be at arm's length applying Transactional Net
Margin Method (TNMM).
11 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
15.18. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in applying Bright Line Test
("BLT") for computing adjustment on account of expenditure on advertisement
and brand promotion expenses, without appreciating that in absence of specific
provision in the Transfer Pricing statutory provisions in India., adjustment
on account of the arm's length price of the advertisement and brand promotion
expenses could not be made.
15.19. The DRPTPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that such a
Transfer Pricing adjustment cannot at all be made in law without determining
the Arm's Length Price ("ALP") by applying one of the methods specified in
section 92C of the Act.
15.20. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that merely
because the net profit rate of the appellant was better than the corresponding
net profit rate of comparable companies, would not lead to the conclusion that
incurring of AMP expenses for the AE was at arm's length.
15.21 That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in ignoring that
"bright line limit" is not a prescribed method under the purview of section
92C of the Act.
15.22. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that the appellant has long-term rights to use the trademark/
licensed intangibles and reaps all the benefits of the said A&M expenses and
is thus the economic owner of any related marketing intangible.
15.23. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that all the key decisions with respect to advertising, marketing,
selling and distribution of the products manufactured by the appellant for
sale in designated territories are taken by the appellant and consequently,
the appellant is responsible / eligible for the related risks and reward.
15.24. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in holding that
the appellant should have earned a mark-up in respect of the AMP expenses,
alleged to have incurred for and on behalf of the associated enterprise.
15.25. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in individually
examining the international transactions entered into by the appellant, not
appreciating that such transactions being closely linked, ought to have been

15.26.That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in considering the

    15.28       That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in not following
the DRP direction to take the correct figures for turnover and AMP expenditure
for Hindustan Motors.
16.0. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in making transfer
pricing adjustment amounting to Rs.311,73,59,562/- in relation to the
international transaction of payment of royalty entered into by the appellant.
13 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
16.1. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law, in not
appreciating that the international transaction of payment of royalty entered
into by the appellant was appropriately established to be at arm's length
applying Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM).
16.2. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in artificially
splitting the single and inseverable license agreement entered into by the
applicant into two separate agreements for use of technology and for use of
brand name failing to appreciate that the License Agreement provided the
appellant an exclusive right and license to manufacture and sell the licensed
product for a specified duration in India and all others rights vested in the
license agreement including technology, technical know how and Trade Mark are
linked to the core right to manufacture and sell licensed products and were
are linked to the core right to manufacture and sell licensed products and
were therefore inseverable.
16.3. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that the methods used by the Ld. TPO to compute the arm's length
royalty is not a method prescribed in TP regulations under Income tax Act,
1961 Therefore the addition made by TPO is void-ab -initio.
16.4. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that the decision to obtain the licensed trademarks was taken
solely/exclusively by the appellant for its business purposes since its
inception [as against being imposed on it by SMC Motor Corporation ('A.E' or '
SMC')].
16.5. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that the license agreement signed between the Assessee and its AE
(i.e. SMC) was signed in 1982 when the appellant was a wholly owned government
company and thus the license agreement was entered into between two unrelated
enterprises thereby complying with the arm's length standard as per the
Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method.
16.6. Failing to appreciate that by the time when Assessee started using the
co- branded trademark "Maruti - Suzuki", Maruti brand was totally new brand
whereas "Suzuki" brand had international presence and therefore there cannot
be any question of impairment of the Maruti Brand and reinforcement of Suzuki
Brand.
16.7. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate that the License Agreement was entered into by the appellant with
the approval of the Secretariat of Industrial Assistance, Ministry of Commerce
and Industry/ approval from the Reserve Bank of India.
14 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
16.8. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in holding that co-
branding of "Maruti-Suzuki" has resulted in the reinforcement of value of
"Suzuki" brand and simultaneous impairment of "Maruti" trademark failing to
appreciate that such concept of "reinforcement" cannot be considered to be an
"international transaction" as defined in section 92B of the Act which
consists of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property;
16.9. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in holding, on the
basis of conjectures and surmises that, the associated enterprises has charged
separate royalty for the use of technology and for use of brand name in the
proportion in which it incurs expenditure on R&D and Brand promotion.
16.10. Without prejudice, the assessing officer erred in considering the
consolidated financials of the associated enterprise for the purpose of
segregating the payment of royalty for the use of technology and for the use
of brand name.
16.11 That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in failing to
appreciate stature of the associated enterprise and the brand recognition
enjoyed by it globally.
16.12. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in ignoring the
search for third party independent technology agreements conducted by the
appellant.
16.13. Without prejudice, the assessing officer erred in failing to appreciate
the permissible limits of RBI for the payment of the brand royalty i.e. 5% on
domestic sales and 8% on exports for composite royalty (both brand and
technology) and 1 % and 2% if only for brand resulting is a maximum 20-25% of
royalty attribution towards brand as against the 46% computed by the TPO.
16.14. Without prejudice, the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in
not appreciating that if compensation for AMP expenses was to be received by
the assessee from it's AE, it will effectively transfer the economic ownership
of the brand of the associated enterprise, and in which case it would be
grossly unjustified to disallow the payment of royalty for use of brand name.
17.0. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in making various
statements/ averments merely based on conjecture/surmises and unsound
presumptions, which were not in accordance with the facts of the case, thereby
making a high pitched assessment disregarding judicial pronouncements
undertaking the TP adjustment.
15 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
18.0. That the A.O has erred in law, on facts and in the circumstances of the
case in allowing TDS credit of Rs.39,53,78,592/- only against
Rs.42,81,91,036/- claimed by the appellant in the revised return of income or
before DRP, thereby allowing a short-credit of Rs.3,28,12,444/-.
19.0. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in charging
interest under sections 234B, 234C and 234D of the Act.
19.1. That the Assessing Officer grossly erred in computing the interest u/s
234B of the Act by first adjusting the interest computed under that section on
the basis of the assessed income against the self assessment tax paid by the
appellant.
19.2. That the Assessing Officer erred on facts and in law in charging
interest u/s 234C on assessed Income instead of returned Income as per the

3\. Starting business in 1909 as Suzuki Loom Works, SMC was incorporated in
1920. SMC designs and manufactures Passenger cars, Commercial vehicles,
Motorcycles, outboard motors, generators, general purpose engines, marine and
power products. Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) was incorporated on
February 24, 1981 as a fully owned Government Company for the modernization of
Indian Automobile Industry and production of fuel-efficient vehicles. In
October 1982, MSIL chose SMC as its partner, and SMC acquired 26% equity stake
in the company. SMC further increased its share to 50% in 1992, converting
MSIL into a Non-Governmental Company. Subsequent to the disinvestment in May
2002 by the Government of India, SMC now holds 54.2% equity in MSIL. MSIL is
engaged in the manufacturing of passenger cars primarily for sale in the
Indian market. It also exports vehicles to various countries in Europe, Asia,
etc. MSIL has various models currently plying on Indian roads including Maruti
800, Omni, Esteem, Alto, Gypsy, Swift, Versa, Wagon R, SX4, Vitara, Zen
Estilo, Swift DZire and Ertiga. MSIL undertakes sales promotion and customer

143(1) on 29/03/2011 at returned income. The assessee filed objections before
the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP). The Dispute Resolution Panel vide  17 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 dated 30.12.2013 rejected all the grounds raised by the
assessee and directed the Assessing Officer to allow the TDS credit of
Rs.17,21,027/-. The Assessing Officer completed the assessment vide order
dated 02.01.2014. The Assessing Officer made various additions amounting of
Rs. 2071,04,18,575/-.
4\. Being aggrieved by the same, the Assessee filed this appeal.
5\. Ground No. 1 to 2 are general in nature as per submissions of the Ld. AR,
therefore, the same are dismissed.
6\. Ground No. 3 to 3.2 are regarding disallowing deduction claimed u/s 43B of
the Act. The issue raised relates to allowability of deduction of statutory
duties on payment basis under Section 43B of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ('the
Act'). The Assessee in the return of income claimed deduction of
Rs.78,01,08,417 in respect of various statutory duties paid during the year
under consideration under section 43B of the Act. The duties so paid include
excise duty, custom duty on import/ purchase of inputs/components and also
amount of duty paid in PLA account. The Assessing Officer, following the
Assessment Order for the earlier years disallowed the aforesaid amount of
Rs.78,01,08,417/- on the ground that deduction under Section 43B of the Act is
allowable only where the amount claimed as deduction on actual payment basis
is charged to the P&L Account. It is primarily the case of the Assessing
Officer that the amount paid by the assessee is in the nature of advance
payment of duty, liability in respect of which has not accrued/ crystallized
and consequently, such advance payment is not allowable as deduction.
7\. The Ld. AR submitted that the Assessing Officer failed to appreciate that
as per the mandate of Section 43B of the Act any amount of duty paid by the
assessee is allowable as deduction on payment basis irrespective of the method
of accounting followed by the assessee. Such duty can only be claimed in the
year of payment and not in any other year(s). Accordingly, irrespective of the
treatment given by the assessee to the various amount of duties paid during
18 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the year under consideration, the duties paid were
allowable as deduction under section 43B of the Act. Therefore, the Ld. AR
submitted that the aggregate amount of Rs. 78,01,08,417/- was allowable as
deduction to the assessee under section 43B of the Act. The Ld. AR relied upon
the following decisions:-
> • Berger Paints India Ltd. Vs. CIT(2004) 266 ITR 99 (S.C) • CIT v. Shri Ram
> Honda Power Equipment Corporation : 258 CTR 329 / 352 ITR 481 (SC) • CIT v.

> Assessment Years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97, reported in 255 CTR 140 and
> orders for assessment years 1999-00, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2005-06 and 2006-07.
8\. The Ld. DR submitted that the Hon'ble High Court has not considered impact
of deduction with respect to Section 145A. Section 43B is a non- obstante
clause which overrides the provisions of the Act. Thus, the Ld. DR submitted
that this issue has to be remanded back to the file of the Assessing Officer
for verification. The Ld. DR submitted that the use of the words  19 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 irrespective of the previous year in which the liability to pay
such sum was incurred by the assessee occurring in Section 43B to mean that
whether or not the liability to pay such sum was incurred is immaterial and
that if an amount of tax or duty is paid in the first year as advance, then
the deduction is to be allowed in that year itself, but one of the primary
conditions for the operation of section 43B is that the liability to pay tax
or duty must necessarily have been incurred. The Ld. DR submitted that this
has also been observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Allied Motors (P) Ltd.
v. CIT (1997) 224 ITR 677 (SC), which is reproduced below:
> "As is evident from the Budget Speech of the Finance Minister for the year
> 1983-84 and the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill,
> 1983 that section 43B was clearly aimed at curbing the activities of those
> taxpayers, who did not discharge their statutory liability of payment of
> excise duty, employer's contribution to Provident Fund, etc. for long
> periods of time but claimed deductions in that regard from their income on
> the ground that the liability to pay these amounts had been incurred by them
> in the relevant Previous Year. It was to stop this mischief that section 43B
> was inserted... "
9\. According to the Ld. DR, vide para 4.1 on page 3 of its order for A.Y.
2006-07, the coordinate Bench of this Tribunal has, itself agreed that the
amounts paid under PLA are nothing but excise duty paid as advance inasmuch as
in Indian Molasses Co. (P.) Ltd. 37 ITR 66, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated
that "Spending" in the sense of "paying out or away" of money is the primary
meaning of "expenditure and "Expenditure" is what is paid out or away and is
gone irretrievably. Basing on this, he argued that the expenditure, which is
deductible for income tax purposes is one which is towards a liability
existing at the time, but putting aside of money which may become expenditure
on the happening of an event is not an expenditure and on this analogy, he
submitted that any advance payment of tax or duty cannot be considered as
expenditure since it is neither irretrievably gone nor does it relate to any
existing liability. In reply to the submission on behalf of the assessee that
the  20 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 issue was covered in the assessee's own case for
the assessment years 1994- 95, 1995-96, 1996-97, 1999-00, 2000-01, 2002-03,
2004-05, 2005-06, 2006- 07 and 2007-08, the Ld. DR submits that these are
continuous issues forming part of the assessment order for AY 2005-06 and
2006-07 also, and are at present pending for adjudication before Hon'ble Delhi
High Court. On this issue, for A.Y. 2006-07 a coordinate Bench of this
Tribunal, vide 4.13 of its order:
"4.13 Under the 'Inclusive method', the figure of purchase, sale and
inventories are required to be taken with the element of tax or duty etc.
Since the amount of unutilized balance of excise duty under PLA does not form
part of purchase, this amount will be eligible for separate deduction u/s. 43
B. At the same time, the last year's unutilized PLA getting deduction in that
year due to the application of section 43B, would be required to be added back
to the income of the current year as determined above. We, therefore, set
aside the impugned order and direct the A.O. to firstly recast the assessee's
profit and loss account on inclusive basis and then make suitable deduction in
respect of the amount of unutilized PLA at the end of the current year and
also the preceding year. "
While reproducing the above paragraph for AY 2007-08, the Tribunal observed as
under:
"8.5 We find that the ITAT under similar set of facts has decided an identical
issue after discussing in detail and following the decision cited before it
including the decision of special Bench of the ITAT in the case of DCIT vs.
Glaxo Smith Klin Consumer Health Care Ltd. (supra) holding that the excess
amount of excise duty reflected in the account-current is nothing but actual
payment of excise duty even though mentioned as advance payment and hence
allowable as deduction under sec. 43B of the Act in the year of payment. The
special bench has further clarified that the allowing of deduction on payment
basis could not result in double deduction under any  21 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
circumstance. We thus respectfully following the above decision set aside the
matter to the file of the Assessing Officer to decide the issue afresh after
affording opportunity of being heard to the assessee as per the decision cited
above in the case of assessee itself for the assessment year 2006-07 (supra).
Ground Nos. 3, 3.0.1 to 3.1.1 are accordingly allowed for statistical
purposes."
The Ld. DR submitted that there is no change in the circumstances that are
discussed in para No 8.5 of the above order so as to take any contrary view.
The Ld. DR submitted plea of the Revenue that these are continuous issues
forming part of the assessment order for AY 2005-06 and 2006-07 also, and are
at present pending adjudication before Hon'ble Delhi High Court is not a
ground for us to deviate from the consistent view taken by this Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the earlier years.
9\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent to
note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case for A.Y. 1994-
95 to 1996-97 held as under:
> "3. Issue involved in grounds No 3 to 3.0.2 relates to the allowability or

It is primarily the case of the assessing officer that the amount paid by the
23 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 assessee is in the nature of advance payment of duty,
liability in respect of which has not accrued/ crystallized and consequently,
such advance payment is not allowable as deduction. Dispute Resolution Panel
("DRP"), also approved the findings of the assessing officer on the ground
that similar issues arising in the preceding years is pending before the ITAT
as well as the Honble High Court.
3.2. It is the submission of the Ld. AR that the assessing officer/DRP, failed
to appreciate that as per the mandate of section 43B of the Act any amount of
duty paid by the assessee is allowable as deduction on the basis of payment
itself irrespective of the method of accounting followed by the assessee and
such a duty can only be claimed in the year of payment but not in any other
year, and therefore, irrespective of the treatment given by the assesSee to
the various amount of duties paid during the year under consideration, the
duties paid were allowable as deduction under section 43B of the Act.

Rs.66,23,77,487 was allowable as deduction to the assessee under section 43B
of the Act. Ld. AR further submitted that this  24 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 issue
is, in principle, also covered by the order of the Delhi High Court in
assessee's own case for the assessment years 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996- 97,
reported in 255 CTR 140.
3.4. In the light of these submissions and detailed explanation offered by
both the parties now we shall proceed to deal with the item wise submissions
under Ground No.3."
10\. As can be seen from the factual aspect for A.Y. 1994-95, the said issue
is dealt hereinafter as the assessee has taken separately each item of the
disallowance. Hence, Ground Nos. 3 to 3.2 does not require adjudication.
11\. Ground Nos. 3.3 to 3.4 is regarding PLA balance on Excise Duty on
Vehicles, R & D Cess on vehicles and Excise Duty on spare parts. The return of
income, the assessee claimed deduction of duty paid amounting to
Rs.67,03,179/-, being balance in the PLA, under section 43B of the Act. The
aforesaid amount was paid by the assessee under Rule 4 of the Excise Rules,
2002 in order to cover the duty required to be paid on the goods to be removed
from bonded warehouse. At the time of removal of the goods, excise duty/R&D
Cess payable on the goods is debited to the PLA. As per the mandate of section
43B of the Act, the aforesaid amount was claimed as deduction in the return of
income. The Assessing Officer disallowed the same following the assessment
order for the preceding assessment years.
12\. The Ld. AR submitted in the assesseee's own case for the assessment year
1999-2000, the Tribunal allowed the claim subject to incurring of liability on
manufactured goods. The assessee had closing stock on 31st March, 2009, of
manufactured vehicles amounting to Rs.166 crores, which sum includes the
accrued liability of excise duty and R&D cess amounting to Rs.12.87 Crores.
This amount of accrued liability has been debited to the profit and loss
account for the relevant previous year and also included in the valuation of
the closing  25 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 stock. The Ld. AR relied on the decision
of Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of DCIT v. Glaxo Smith Kline
Consumer Health Care Ltd reported in 107 ITD 343 (SB) (Chd.), wherein it is
held that PLA balance is an allowable deduction. Further, the issue stands
covered in favour of the assessee in view of decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of CIT v. Modipon Ltd.: CA No.19763, 19767, 19768,19770 of
2017 / 87 taxmann.com 275 (SC). Similar view has been taken by the Delhi Bench
of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the assessment years 1994-95,
1995-96, 1996-97, 1999-00, 2000-01, 2004-05, 2005-06,2006-07,2007-08 and
2008-09. The order of the Tribunal has been confirmed by Hon'ble Delhi High
Court for the assessment years 1994-95,1995-96 and 1996-97, reported in 255
CTR 140. The orders of the Delhi Tribunal have been affirmed by the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court for the assessment years 1999-00 (ITA No.31/2005) and 2000-01
(ITA No.442/2005).
13\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment order.
14\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case held as
under:
"15. In the present case, the assessee had no option, but to keep the account,
in respect of each excisable U' product (evident from the mandate in Rule 173G
that it "shall keep an account current"). The latter part of the main rule
makes it clear beyond any doubt that the assessee has no choice in the
obligation, and cannot remove the goods manufactured by it, unless sufficient
amounts are kept in credit:
"...and the assessee shall periodically made credit in such account- current,
by cash payment into the treasury, so as to keep the balances, in such
account-current sufficient to cover the duly due on the goods intended to be
removed at any time, and every such assessee shall pay the duty determined by
him for consignment by debit to such account-current before  26 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 removal of the goods"
The revenue's contention that the amounts in credit also relate to goods not
manufactured, and therefore not relatable to any "liability incurred" is, in
the opinion of this Court, without any basis. The arrangement prescribed by
the rule is both a collection mechanism - dictated by convenience, as well as
mandatory. It is convenient, for the reason that if the assessee were to be
asked to pay the exact amount, through some other method, by deposit, as a
precondition for clearance, that would have been cumbersome to it as well as
the revenue; it would also have led to problems of storage of goods, and slow
down their supply and distribution. The Rule makers pragmatically directed
that "sufficient" amounts ought to be maintained in the account, to cover the
removals. Therefore, at any given point of time, there had to be an excess in
the account, if the assessee were to remove the goods. Each clearance mentions
the quantum of goods, and the duty amount, which is apparently reconciled at
the end of the period, and shortfalls if any are appropriated from the
account. The excess credit is likewise adjusted for the next day's clearances.
The point to be underlined is that there is no choice, and the amounts relate
to the assessee's duty liability, falling within the description under Section
43-B. The consequence of not allowing the amounts as deductions, are vividly
brought out in the decision of the Allahabad High Court in C.L. Gupta & Sons
(supra), where it was held that:
"10. In the case in hand, admittedly, the amount of customs duty of Rs.
3,56,451 was paid by the assessee in March, 1987, and, therefore, in terms of
Section 43B it is deductible only in the year in which it is actually paid,
i.e., for the assessment year 1987-88, irrespective of the year in which the
assessee incurred the liability on the basis of the method of accounting
regularly adopted by him and, therefore, in view of the clear provisions of
law, the deduction cannot be allowed in the assessment year 1988-89. In our
view, both the learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal as  27 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 well as the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) fell in error in
holding that since the assessee-firm debited the cost of goods imported
including the duty paid on delivery of goods in the trading account in April,
1987, and before the actual delivery of the goods, the value of the goods and
customs duty paid thereon was shown in the balance-sheet as document in hands,
therefore, the deduction should be allowed in the assessment year 1988-89, is
contrary to the prescription of law. Section 43B in clear terms provides that
the deduction claimed by the assessee in respect of any sum paid by way of
tax, duty, cess or fee, shall be allowed only in computing the income referred
to in Section 28 of that previous year in which it was actually paid,
irrespective of the previous year in which the liability was incurred for the
payment of such sum as per the method of accounting regularly employed by the
assessee. For the purpose of claiming benefit of deduction of the sum paid
against the liability of tax, duty, cess, fee, etc., the year of payment is
relevant and is only to be taken into account. The year in which the assessee
incurred the liability to pay such tax. duty, etc., has no relevance and
cannot be linked with the matter of giving benefit of deduction under Section
43B of the Act. In this view of the matter, the appeal deserves to be allowed.
16\. This court also notices that the Supreme Court has upheld the view which
allows assessee's to claim credits, such as Modvat, etc, falling within the
description of liability paid, to escape the mischief of Section 43-B. CIT v.
Shri Ram Honda Power Equipment Corpn. [2012] 210 Taxman 577/26 taxmann.com
331(SC) As a result of the above discussion, the first question is answered in
favour of the assessee, and against the revenue."
The Hon'ble Delhi High Court has already decided this issue in favour of the
assessee for A.Ys. 1999-00 and 2000-01. Therefore, in absence of any  28 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 contrary material brought to our notice by the Ld. DR against
the order of the Tribunal, we allow Ground Nos. 3.3 to 3.4.
15\. In result, Ground Nos. 3.3. to 3.4 are allowed.
16\. As regards to Ground No. 3.5, relating to Customs Duty paid on import of
components for export purposes for which exports has been made. The assessee
has been consistently following exclusive method of accounting in respect of
custom duty paid on import of components for export purposes. Accordingly,
duties paid on purchases are not included in the cost of purchases and the
value of closing stock in the profit and loss account. Addition of the duty,
both in the purchases as well as the closing stock as per the requirement of
section 145A, is tax neutral inasmuch as the same amount is both debited as
well as credited to the profit and loss account. However, to give effect to
the provisions of section 43B, which mandates that duties paid by the assessee
are allowable only on payment basis, custom duty paid by the assessee on
import of components for export purposes, whether or not export against the
same had actually taken place during the relevant year, is claimed as
deduction in the return of income. The Assessing Officer, disallowed the same
following the Assessment Order for the assessment year 2005-06, wherein it was
held that since the assessee is entitled for duty drawback, which becomes
immediately due on the date of export, the amount of custom duty on import is
revenue neutral. Consequently, no deduction is allowable to the assessee in
respect of the same.
17\. The Ld. AR submitted that assessing officer failed to appreciate that
Duty drawback does not accrue automatically on export of goods since the
exporter is required to fulfill various conditions/requirements in order to
claim the same. Duty drawback accrues only when the claim of the exporter-
assessee is sanctioned by the custom authorities; Duty drawback receivable is
separately chargeable to tax as income of the assessee under section 28 of the
Act.
29 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Receipt of duty drawback is altogether different from allowability of
deduction in respect of which duty paid by the assessee on payment basis under
section 43B of the Act. The Ld. AR further submitted that without prejudice to
the aforesaid, in case the assessing officer's contention were to be accepted,
then duty drawback income amounting to Rs. 15,93,11,093/- declared by the
assessee himself, being the amount of duty drawback received in the instant
year but which allegedly accrued in the previous year, as per the principle
adopted by the assessing officer is not taxable in the year under
consideration. The Ld. AR submitted that there is no justification for
adopting two different and inconsistent methods while computing the income of
the present year. The aforesaid sum was duly declared as the income of the
immediately succeeding year on receipt, a method consistently adopted by the
assessee company and accepted by the AO since inception. The Tribunal has
decided the aforesaid issue in favour of assessee in the assessment years
1999-00, 2000-01, 2001- 02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06, AY 2006-07, 2007-08 and
2008-09. The orders of the Delhi Tribunal have been affirmed by the Delhi High
Court for assessment years 1999-00 (ITA No.250/2005), 2000-01 (ITA
No.976/2005), 2005-06 (ITA Nos. 171 and 172/2012) and 2006-07 (ITA No.
381/2016). Further, the issue stand covered in favour of the assessee in view
of the decision of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of
CIT v. Sriyansh Knitters P. Ltd. 336 ITR 235 wherein the High Court, while
affirming the finding of the Tribunal held that duty drawback accrues in the
year in which rate is fixed by the competent authority after verification of
claim of the assessee and amount is quantified and not in the year of export.
Similar view has been held in the case of CIT v. Manav Tools (India) P. Ltd:
336 ITR 237 (P&H). It has been held similarly by the Delhi High Court in
assessee's own case for assessment years 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98,
1998-99, 1999-00, 2001-02 and 2004-05.
18\. The Ld. DR relied upon the assessment orders.
30 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
19\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case held as
under:
"6. Question (iii) concerns the disallowance of an addition of Rs.
20,60,14,392 representing the customs duty paid on imports claimed as a
deduction under Section 43B of the Act. This was directly paid by the Assessee
to the customs authorities and paid during the AY in question. Consequently,
it was correctly allowed as a deduction by the ITAT. Question (iii) therefore,
is answered in the affirmative i.e. in favour of the Assessee and against the
Revenue."
The facts of the present case and the decision of the Delhi High Court is on
identical issue. Thus, this issue is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in favour of the assessee.
20\. In result, Ground No. 3.5. is allowed.
21\. Ground No. 3.6 to 3.7 is regarding balance in RG 23A Part II the assessee
had claimed deduction u/s 43B of the Act amounting to Rs. 10,15,93,048/-
representing balance in RG23A as on 31.03.2009. The aforesaid amount
represents excise duty paid on raw material and inputs purchased by the
assessee for use in the manufacture of automobiles. Under the central excise
law, the assessee is entitled to claim MODVAT Credit in respect of the amount
of central excise duty so paid on raw material and inputs purchased for
manufacture of excisable goods. The said amount of duty paid to the supplier
of raw material and inputs is regarded as amount of central excise duty
actually paid by the assessee under the Excise Laws. Since the aforesaid
amount of excise duty was actually paid by the assessee as part of purchase
price of raw material and inputs, the same has been claimed as deduction under
section 43 B of the Act. The Assessing Officer, however, disallowed the
aforesaid amount following the assessment orders for the preceding years.
31 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
22\. The Ld. AR submitted that the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case
of DCIT v Glaxo SmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd: 107 ITD 343/ 299 ITR (AT)
1 (Chd.) (SB), has held that, unutilized MODVAT credit is not an allowable
deduction, since such credit does not amount to payment of duty. Therefore,
the Ld. AR pointed out that, as a result of the order of the Tribunal, such
deduction may be held as not allowable to the assessee in the instant year but
would be allowable in the year when the same is adjusted against excise duty
payable. The principle laid down is that deduction is allowable in the year
when adjustment is made and not in the year of purchase of raw material/input.
Following the order of the Special Bench in Glaxo (supra), the ITAT in
assessee's own case for AY 2001-02 decided the issue against the assessee.
However, the Supreme Court has held that deduction is allowable u/s 43B of the
Act for the amount lying credited in the Modvat account at the end of the
accounting year, dismissing the SLP (No. 23461/2012) filed by the department
against the order of the High Court in the case of Shri Ram Honda Power
Equipment Ltd: [2013] 258 CTR 329 / 352 ITR 481 (SC). Following the above
judgment, the ITAT in AY 2006-07, AY 2007-08 and 2008-09 decided the aforesaid
issue in favour of assessee. The Ld. AR pointed out that the aforesaid issue
has been decided against the assessee by the Delhi High Court in assessment
years 1999-00 (ITA No.31/2005 and 250/2005), 2000-01 (ITA No.442/2005) and
2004-05 (ITA No.397/2009). The High Court has, however, decided the alternate
claim in favour of the assessee and held that unutilized MODVAT credit of
earlier year to the extent adjusted in the year under consideration shall be
allowed as deduction in the relevant year ( para 45 of Delhi High Court order
for AY 1999-00 in ITA No.31/2005). Thus the Ld. AR submitted that the assessee
may be allowed the deduction representing the RG 23A balance at the end of
Assessment Year 2008-09 amounting to Rs.18,47,40,688/- being the opening
balance in the instant assessment year. The High Court has further allowed
deduction for amount representing additional or countervailing duty which has
been paid directly to the custom authorities. Thus, the Ld. AR requested that
the Assessing Officer may be  32 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 directed to allow
deduction for amount forming part of RG 23A balance to the extent it has been
directly paid to custom authorities.
23\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of the Assessing Officer.
24\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case held as
under:
"32. An analysis of Section 43B of the Act reveals that for the deduction
there under to be allowed, the following conditions are required to be
satisfied.
(a) there should be an actual payment of excise duty whether "by way of tax,
duty, cess or fee, by whatever name";
(b) such payment has to be "under any law for the time being in force"
(c) the payment of such sum should have been made by the Assessee;
d) irrespective of the method of accounting regularly employed by the
Assessee, deduction shall be allowed while computing the income tax for the
previous year "in which sum is actually paid" by the Assessee;
e) the expression 'any such sum payable' refers to a sum for which the
Assessee "incurred liability in the previous year even though such sum might
not have been payable within that year under the relevant law.
33\. There are two kinds of payment envisaged by Section 43B of the Act. Tax
payable could be in the form of excise duty on the raw material/inputs
purchased by the manufacturer. The second kind of payment could be of excise
duty that is payable by manufacturer on the final product at the time of
clearance of such final products from the factory.
34\. In Eicher Motors (supra), a challenge was raised to the validity of Rule
33 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 57F (4A) of the CE Rules under which credit which was
lying unutilised as of 16th March 1995 with the manufacturers stood lapsed in
the manner set out therein. The Supreme Court upheld the challenge by the
manufacturers to the aforementioned Rule 57F (4A) of the CE Rules on the
ground that under the MODVAT scheme as it existed on the date of change, i.e.
16th March 1995, MODVAT credit lying in the balance with the Assessee
represented "a vested right accrued or acquired by the Assessee under the
existing law". It was observed as under:
> "5............ when on the strength of the Rules available, certain acts
> have been done by the parties concerned, incidents following thereto must
> take place in accordance with the Scheme under which the duty had been paid
> on the manufactured products and if such a situation is sought to be
> altered, necessarily it follows that the right, which had accrued to a party
> such as the availability of a scheme, is affected and, in particular, it
> loses sight of the fact that the provision for facility of credit is as good
> as tax paid till tax is adjusted on future goods on the basis of the several
> commitments which would have been made by the Assessee concerned."
35\. It was further explained that the MODVAT credit is "a right accrued to
the assessee on the date when they paid the tax on the raw materials or the
inputs and that right would continue until the facility available thereto gets
worked out or until those goods existed."
36\. In Dai Ichi Karkaria (supra), the question that arose for consideration
was whether the cost of the raw material was the price paid by the
manufacturer to its seller, as contended by the Revenue, or is it the price of
raw material minus the excise duty thereon which has been paid by the seller
and for which the manufacturer is entitled to credit under the MODVAT scheme
to be utilized against the payment of excise duty on products manufactured by
him, including the intermediate product, as contended by the manufacturer. The
Supreme Court analysed the entire MODVAT scheme,  34 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 in
particular Rules 57A to 571, and observed as under:
"18. It is clear from these Rules, as we read them, that a manufacturer
obtains credit for the excise duty paid on raw material to be used by him in
the production of an excisable product immediately it makes the requisite
declaration and obtains an acknowledgement thereof. It is entitled to use the
credit at any time thereafter when making payment of excise duty on the
excisable product. There is no provision in the Rules which provides for a
reversal of the credit by the excise authorities except where it has been
illegally or irregularly taken, in which event it stands cancelled or, if
utilised, has to be paid for. We are here really concerned with credit that
has been validly taken, and its benefit is available to the manufacturer
without any limitation in time or otherwise unless the manufacturer itself
chooses not to use the raw material in its excisable product. The credit is,
therefore, indefeasible. It should also be noted that there is no corelation
of the raw material and the final product; that is to say, it is not as if
credit can be taken only on a final product that is manufactured out of the
particular raw material to which the credit is related. The credit may be
taken against the excise duty on a final product manufactured on the very day
that it becomes available.
19\. It is, therefore, that in the case of Eicher Motors Ltd. vs. Union of
India (1999) 2 SCC 361 this Court said that a credit under the MODVAT scheme
was as good as tax paid."
37\. Now turning to the treatment of the said payment of excise duty which has
any MODVAT credit in the books of accounts, a reference may be made first to
the AS-2 issued by the ICAI, para 7 of which reads as under:
"Costs of Purchase
7\. The costs of purchase consist of the purchase price including duties and
taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from  35
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the taxing authorities), freight inwards and other
expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition. Trade discounts,
rebates, duty drawbacks and other similar items are deducted in determining
the costs of purchase."
38\. The ICAI has also issued a Guidance Note for treatment of MODVAT/CENVAT.
Paras 16 and 18 of the Guidance Note reads thus:
"16. Specified duty paid on inputs may be debited to a separate account, e.g.
MODVAT/CENVAT Credit Receivable (inputs) Account. As and when MODVAT/CENVAT
credit is actually utilized against payment of excise duty on final products,
appropriate accounting entries will be required to adjust the excise duty paid
out of MODVAT/CENVAT Credit Receivable (inputs) Account to the account
maintained for payment / provision for excise duty on final product. In this
case, the purchase cost of the inputs would be net of the specified duty on
inputs. Therefore, the inputs consumed and the inventory of inputs would be
valued on the basis of purchase cost net of the specified duty on inputs. The
debit balance in MODVAT/ CENVAT Credit Receivable (Inputs) should be shown on
the assets side under the head 'advances', xxx
18\. A question may arise as to when the 'MODVAT/CENVAT' credit should be
taken if documents evidencing payment of specified duty on inputs are received
later than the physical receipt of the goods.According to the accrual concept
of accounting, one may account for such credit, provided one is reasonably
certain of getting the said documents at a later date."
39\. The above Guidance Note answers both issues raised by the Revenue. One is
that it clarified that MODVAT Credit is treated as a separate account where
appropriate accounting entries will be made to adjust the excise duty paid out
of the said account. It is clear that the debit balance in MODVAT/CENVAT
Credit Receivable (Inputs) has to be shown on the assets  36 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 side, under the head 'advances'. According to the accrual concept
of accounting (mercantile system), credit is taken even after the documents
evidencing payment of specific duty on inputs are received later than the
physical receipt of the goods.
40\. Mr. Bhatia is right in pointing out that the Assessee has two options.
One, to claim excise duty paid as explained, and the other, to claim it under
MODVAT credit for utilization at a subsequent point in time. It is plain that
the Assessee in the present case has not exercised the first option.
41.1. The Court now turns to the decision in Oswal Agro Mills (supra). The
facts, in brief, in the above decision were that the Appellant therein was
engaged in the manufacture and trade of products like de-oiled meals,
industrial hard oil, edible oils etc. The Assessee entered into agreements
with other entities for the purchase of imported palm stearin fatty acid
('imported material') from the said importers. In terms of the said agreement,
the imported material was to be purchased by the Appellant at landed cost,
i.e. CIF price, customs duty, clearing charges, etc. and 3% ofthe total cost.
Under Clause 11 of the agreements, any liability arising after the sale of the
imported material in respect of customs duty, excise duty, penalty, sales tax,
etc. would be paid by the appellant and included in the landed cost of
imported material.
41.2 At the time of actual import of material, the Customs Department demanded
100% of the applicable customs duty as additional customs duty on the CIF
value of the imported material. The additional demand was challenged by the
importers before the Supreme Court. As an interim measure, the Supreme Court
allowed the clearance of imported material on payment of 15% of the disputed
additional customs duty. A stay was granted for the balance 85% subject to
furnishing of bank guarantees by the importers in favour of the Customs
Department. In terms of the agreement between the appellant and the importers,
the appellant provided counter guarantees for  37 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the
bank guarantees provided by the importers for the unpaid disputed amount of
85% of the additional customs duty.
41.3. As far as the Appellant therein was concerned, the unpaid additional
customs duty pertaining to the previous year relevant to AY 1987- 88 was Rs.
1,64,87,375. The Appellant therein, following the mercantile system of
accounting, claimed deduction on account of the said additional customs duty,
in as much as the same was included in the landed cost of the imported
material. The AO rejected the claim since the Appellant therein had failed to
produce evidence by which it could be ascertained that the liability to pay
the additional customs duty was crystallized during the period relevant to the
ASSESSMENT YEAR .41.4. After the CIT (A) also dismissed the appeal of the
Appellant holding that the liability would arise only when the Supreme Court
gave a verdict in favour of the Customs Department, the Appellant went before
the ITAT. Rejecting the Appellant's appeal, the ITAT held that there was no
actual payment and the liability was covered only by the bank guarantee which
had not yet been appropriated or encashed and the same is still in the
ownership of the Appellant and therefore, the claim for deduction could not be
allowed as the bank guarantee cannot fulfill the requirements of expenditure
so as to qualify for deduction from the total income. As far as Section 43B
was concerned, it was held that even assuming it is a statutory liability, as
the liability is eventually fastened upon the Appellant, the provision of bank
guarantee in itself cannot be treated as payment as it has not been adjusted
towards the customs duty.
41.5. This Court concurred with the ITAT and held that as long as the writ
petitions were pending before the Supreme Court, the Appellant therein would
have no obligation to pay any amount as the condition precedent for the
Appellant to pay disputed amount would not be satisfied. The liability of the
Appellant to pay the additional customs duty was contingent upon the  38 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 importers being called upon to pay the same. Reference was
made by this Court to the decision of the Supreme Court in Rotork Controls
India P. Ltd. v. CIT [2009] 314 ITR 62 (SC) where three conditions were laid
down while considering where a provision made for future claims against
warrantees was allowable as a deduction. On the facts of the case, this Court
held that subject liability was a contingent liability in respect thereof
could not be allowed as a deduction for the AY in question.
41.6. Specific to Section 43B, the Court considered whether it was in fact an
obligation of the Appellant therein to pay additional customs duty and whether
such obligation could be considered to be a Court observed:
"Although the Assessee is obliged to pay the additional customs duty as and
when the importers are called upon to pay the same, nonetheless, it cannot be
considered as a statutory liability because the same is not imposed on the
Assessee by virtue of any statute. Customs duty is an incident of import of
goods and an importer is obliged to pay the same under the Customs Act.
Therefore, the liability to pay the additional customs duty is a statutory
liability of the importers. However, in the hands of the Assessee, the
liability to pay the quantum of custom duty imposed on the importers, either
directly to them or on their behalf, cannot be considered as a statutory
liability as this obligation is not imposed by any statute but from the
contracts entered into between the Assessee and the importers. The liability
in question is thus, clearly a contractual liability insofar as the Assessee
is concerned." (emphasis supplied) 41.7. The Court clarified that Section 43B
of the Act would apply "only in cases of statutory liability" and held that:
"This provision would have no application insofar as the assessee is
concerned, as the liability to pay the amount of additional customs duty on
behalf of the importers as and when they are called upon to discharge the  39
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 same is, clearly, a contractual liability and not a
statutory liability. Therefore, the question whether the said liability should
be considered as deductible under Section 43B of the Income Tax Act does not
arise."
42\. In the considered view of the Court, the above decision should answer the
question in the present case in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee. The primary liability to pay excise duty is essentially on the
manufacturers of the raw materials and inputs. As far as the Assessee is
concerned, the liability to pay the said amount is only contractual.
43\. It must be noted at this stage that after hearing the arguments on 21st
September 2017, an affidavit dated 6th November 2017 has been filed by the
Assessee pointing out that out of the total amount of unutilized MODVAT credit
of Rs. 69,93,00,428, an amount of Rs. 15,73,38,110 pertains to goods already
consumed and which were, therefore, not includable in the closing stock of raw
materials and inputs as on 31st March 1999. It is pointed out that this was
noted by the CIT (A) in para 9.16 of the appellate order and that this finding
was not questioned by the Revenue. It is accordingly submitted that even if
the Revenue's contention on the interpretation of Section 43B was accepted,
the Assessee is unquestionably entitled to deduction of the aforementioned
amount of Rs. 15,73,38,110. It is further pointed out that out of the
aforementioned unutilized MODVAT credit claimed as a deduction by the Assessee
for the AY 1999-00, a further amount of Rs. 14,96,79,029 represents additional
or countervailing duty which has been paid by the Assessee directly to the
Customs Department on the import of raw materials, components and the inputs.
This, according to the Assessee, is borne out by the RG-23 (Part-II) Register
maintained by the Assessee and verified and audited from time to time by the
excise authorities. It is asserted that the said amount "has actually been
paid by the Appellant to the customs authorities (and not to the Appellant's
suppliers)" and therefore, this amount should also be allowed under Section
43B of the Act.
40 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
44\. The Court would only like to observe that it would be for the AO to give
effect to the order pertaining to the aforementioned amounts paid by the
Assessee to be made in respect of those goods already consumed as on 31st
March 1999 and in respect of additional countervailing duty paid directly to
the customs authorities. If indeed such payment has been made, the credit for
the same would be allowable as a deduction under Section 43B of the Act.
45\. However, it is also to be noted that in para 35 of the impugned order,
the ITAT has accepted the alternate contention of the Assessee that unutilized
MODVAT credit of an earlier year which has been adjusted in the year in
question should be allowed as a deduction in as much as such adjustment would
have to be treated as an actual payment of excise duty. In view of the Court
agreeing with the ITAT on the non-allowability of unutilized MODVAT credit as
a deduction under Section 43B of the Act for the AY in question, this Court
also agrees with the ITAT's acceptance of the Assessee's alternate contention
with regards to the unutilized MODVAT credit of the earlier year being
allowable as a deduction in the AY in question to the extent that it has been
adjusted by treating as actual payment of the credit for the AY in question.
As the ITAT has already pointed out, the Assessee would be entitled to such
deduction "subject to verification provided the same was not allowed as
deduction in the earlier year."
46\. An attempt was made by Mr. Ganesh to contend that it should now be
allowed to be treated as unutilized MODVAT credit as part of the closing
stock. An attempt was then made by Mr. Ganesh to contend that the amount of
excise duty paid by the Assessee should be treated as expenditure allowed
under Section 37 of the Act as business expenditure. As rig pointed out by Mr.
Bhatia, the Assessee appears to have followed exclusive method of valuation of
stock as opposed to an inclusive stock valuation method. Such a plea was not
taken at any stage of the present case; before the AO, CIT (A) or the ITAT. As
rightly pointed out, if the amoun paid has to be allowed as a deduction  41
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 under Section 37 of the Act then tbs inclusive method of
valuation of stock has to be followed. The Assess- I must opt to either treat
the same as expenditure or treat it as forming part of current assets. If the
plea of deduction under Section 37 is to be allowed then the question of
utilising the unutilized MODVAT credit for payment of excise duty would not
arise at all.
47\. It may be noted that after the insertion of Section 145A of the Act, v
effect from 1st April 2010, an Assessee must now necessarily follow n
inclusive method of valuation of stock. It was explained by the Bombay High
Court in Cartini India Limited v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax [2007]
291 ITR 355 (Bom) that "as per the new provision of Sec: 145 A of the Income-
tax Act, 1961, the unutilized MODVAT credit ha: be included in the closing
stock of raw material and work in progress, whereas the excise duty paid on
unsold finished goods had to be include, m the inventory of finished goods."
However, Section 145A of the Ac- 5 prospective and does not apply to the AY in
question.
48\. The Court is not inclined to permit the Assessee to raise the plea for
more than one reason. In the first place, it is a plea taken for the first
time in these proceedings. It appears to be an afterthought. Secondly, the
ITAT has already accepted another alternate plea made before it by the
Assessee by allowing deduction in respect of the unutilized MODVAT credit of
the earlier AY, the Court is not inclined to disagree with the reasoning and
conclusion of the ITAT. The assessee cannot be allowed to go back and forth on
the above plea. There has to be consistency. Thirdly, balance sheet of the
Assessee for AY 1999-00 shows that the turnover for the year was over Rs.
8,000 crores. The corresponding sum claimed as deduction representing the
unutilized MODVAT credit is not very significant in comparison.
49\. Consequently, Question (ii) is answered in the negative, i.e. in favour
of the Revenue and against the Assessee."
42 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
In view of the finding of the Hon'ble High Court, this issue is remanded back
to the file of the A.O to verify the claim as per the directions of the
Hon'ble High Court and if found proper be allowed for deduction for amount
forming part of RG 23A balance to the extent it has been directly paid to
custom authorities. Needless to say the assessee be given opportunity of
hearing by following principles of natural justice.
25\. In result, Ground No. 3.6 to 3.7 is partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
26\. Ground No. 3.8 is regarding Customs duty included in closing inventory.
In respect of custom duty paid on import of raw material/inputs, the assessee
followed inclusive method of accounting. Accordingly, the amount of custom
duty paid on imported inputs/ raw material is included in the purchase price,
which is debited to the Profit & Loss Account. The said duty is also included
and considered as part of the value of closing stock, which is shown in the
credit side of the Profit & Loss Account. Custom duty of Rs.21,90,94,216/-
represents custom duty on import of raw material/inputs, which is included in
the value of closing stock as per the aforesaid inclusive method of accounting
followed by the assessee. The said method is also in line with the provisions
of section 145A of the Act. Inclusion of custom duty, both in the value of
purchase as well as in the value of closing stock, is tax neutral inasmuch as
the very same amount is both debited and credited to the Profit & Loss
Account. However, as per the mandate under section 43B of the Act, the custom
duty so actually paid by the assessee is separately claimed as deduction on
payment basis in the return of income. The Assessing Officer, however,
disallowed the aforesaid amount holding the same to be merely advance payment,
liability in respect of which has not crystallized and therefore, not
allowable as deduction under section 43 B of the Act.
27\. The Ld. AR submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of
Berger Paints India Limited v CIT (2004) 266 ITR 99 held that customs and  43
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 excise duties are allowable in the year of payment u/s
43B of the Act, and even if such duties are included in the value of closing
stock, they would be separately allowable. The aforesaid issue is covered by
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Samtel Color Ltd wherein the
Court dismissed the SLP in Civil Appeal No 6449/2012 filed by department
against the order of Delhi High Court in 184 Taxman 120 and held that advance
customs duty paid is allowable deduction u/s 43B of the Act. The Karnataka
High Court in the case of CIT v. NCR Corporation India (P) Ltd. 240 Taxman
598, reiterated the principle laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
Berger Paints (supra) and held that the entire amount of excise duty and
customs duty paid by the assessee in a particular year are allowable as
deduction irrespective of the fact that such duties are included in the value
of closing stock. It was further held that provisions of Section 43B, while
overriding all the other provisions of the Act, also override Section 145A and
further that the provisions of section 145A does not in any manner dilute or
nullify the effect of provisions of Section 43B of the Act. The Ld. AR further
submitted that the issue stands covered in favour of the assessee by the order
of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for A.Y 1999-00, 2000-01, 2001-02,
2002-03, 2004-05 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 wherein the Tribunal
has held that, since the duty is paid, deduction claimed u/s 43B of the Act
has to be allowed. The orders of the Delhi Tribunal have been affirmed by the
Delhi High Court for assessment years 1999-00 (ITA No.250/2005), 2000-01 (ITA
No. 976/2005), 2001-02 (ITA No. 519/2010), 2005-06 (ITA No. 171/2012) and
2006-07 (ITA No. 381/2016).
28\. The Ld. DR relied upon the assessment order.
29\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case held as
under:
"12. As regards Question (ix), of the two amounts that represent customs
duty/paid and debited to the P&L account. It is clarified by the Assessee that
44 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the amount of Rs.69,12,41,610/- represents customs
duty included in closing stock and Rs 50,28,051/- represents customs duty on
tools imported by the Assessee which were made available by it to its contract
manufacturers, also. described as vendors in the question of law framed on the
same issue in subsequent AY 2001-02.
13\. In view of the decision in Berger Paints Limited v. CIT [2004] 266ITR 99
(SC), question (ix) is answered in the affirmative i.e. in favour of the
Assessee and against the Revenue. In this regard, the observations of the ITAT
in para 41 of the impugned are reiterated, viz. that the AO should, while
giving effect to the ITAT's order, ensure that no double deduction is allowed.
Therefore, he will ensure that the deduction allowed in this year under
Section 43B of the Act is included in the income of the next year when such
opening stock is disposed of."
Thus, the issue is squarely covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in Assessee's own case. Ground No. 3.8 is allowed.
30\. In result, Ground No. 3.8 is allowed.
31\. Ground No. 3.9 to 3.10 is regarding Customs Duty (CVD) paid which was to
be adjusted against excise duty payable on finished products, Customs Duty on
Goods in Transit/under inspection. This amount represents custom duty/CVD paid
by the assessee during the relevant assessment year under consideration, on
import of components/raw material, which were in transit as on the last date
of financial year. Since the aforesaid amount represents actual custom duty/
CVD paid by the assessee during the year under consideration, the same was
claimed as deduction under section 43B of the Act. The Assessing Officer
disallowed the aforesaid following the Assessment Orders for the preceding
Assessment Years.
45 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
32\. The Ld. AR submitted that the aforesaid issue is covered in favour of the
assessee by the decision of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 6449/2012
dismissing the SLP filed by the department against the order of the Delhi High
Court in the case of CIT vs. Samtel Color Ltd : 184 Taxman 120. The issue
stands covered in favour of the assessee by the order of the Tribunal for the
Assessment Years 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07,
2007-08 and 2008-09.
33\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of the Assessing Officer.
34\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that in assessee's own case the Tribunal held this issue in favour of
the assessee. The Tribunal held as under:
"3.25 Insofar as the disallowance of deduction under Section 43B of the Act
for a sum of Rs.13,51,93,089/- representing custom duty (CVD) paid to be
adjusted against excise duty payable on finished products, and a sum of
Rs.1,93,27,627/- representing custom duty in respect of the goods in
transit/under inspection is concerned, the case of the assessee is that these
amounts represent custom duty/CVD paid by the assessee during the financial
year 2007-08, and since the aforesaid amount represents actual custom duty/CVD
paid by the assessee during the year under consideration, the same was claimed
as deduction under section 43B of the Act. But the assessing officer
disallowed the aforesaid following assessment order for the assessment year
2005-06. Ld. AR submitted that this issue was also decided in favour of
assessee by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 6449/2012 wherein the SLP
filed by the department against the order of the Delhi High Court in the case
of CIT vs. Samtel Color Ltd.: 184 Taxman 120 was dismissed holding that Custom
duty paid is allowable deduction u/s 43B of the Act. He further submits that
apart from this, the issue stands covered in favour of the assessee by the
order of a coordinate bench of this Tribunal for the Assessment years 1999-00,
2000-01, AY 2002-03, AY 2005-06, AY 2006-
46 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
07 and 2007-08 wherein it was held that since the duty is paid, deduction
claimed u/s 43B of the Act has to be allowed.
3.26 Per Contra, on these Grounds 3.6 and 3.7, Ld. DR submitted that in
respect of the amount of Rs.13,51,93,089/- being customs duty (CVD) paid to be
adjusted against excise duty payable on finished products, a coordinate Bench
of this Tribunal has also accepted that under the 'Inclusive method' it will
be inclined in purchases, sales, and opening and closing stock of inventories,
as a result of which the ultimate impact is revenue neutral and no deduction
will be allowable to the assessee under this head. As regards the amount of
Rs.1,93,27,627/- being customs duties on goods in transit/under inspection, he
contends that it is be noted that the duty paid is not tax deductible as goods
in transit are not expenditure of the year and are not routed through the P&L
account. Further according to him, the liability to pay customs barrier and
since the assessee has claimed deduction on this account, the onus of proving
this fact was on the assessee. He points out that it is not on record whether
the assessee has discharged this responsibility, as such in view of the
decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Indian Molasses Co. (P) Ltd. 37 ITR 66,
this amount has to be treated as an advance payment, which is not an allowable
deduction. Lastly he contended that these are continuous issues forming part
of the assessment order for AY 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 also, and are at
present pending adjudication before Hon'ble Delhi High Court.
3.27. Substantially this question had fallen for consideration before a
coordinate Bench of this tribunal in assessee's own case for the AY 2006-07
and 2007-08 and by para Nos. 5.3 and 5.4 of its order for A.Y. 2006-07, a
coordinate Bench of this Tribunal resolved the issue in the following manner,
"5.3. Next item is customs duty (CVD) paid to be adjusted against excise duty
payable on finished products amounting to Rs.15,59,44,258/-, which is the
amount of customs duties on goods in transit/under inspection. The assessee
claimed deduction for the above amounts u/s 43B of the Act, which the AO
denied.
47 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
5.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material on
record. The Ld. AR contended that this issue has been decided in earlier years
in the assessee's favour by the Tribunal. He further referred to the judgment
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in CIT vs. Samtel Colour Ltd. (2009) 184
Taxman 120 (Del) in which it has been held that advance customs duty paid in
the year in question is an admissible deduction u/s 43B. In our considered
opinion, there can be no dispute on the otherwise availability of deduction of
advance customs duty paid by the assessee, which has to be allowed in the year
of payment. In this judgment also, the Hon'ble High Court has noticed vide
para 3 that the provisions of section 145A were not applicable as the
assessment year under consideration was 1995-96. In view of the detailed
discussion supra with reference to the applicability of section 145A to the
year in question, there can be no escape from valuation of purchase, sale and
inventories under the inclusive method. We, therefore, direct the AO to recast
Profit and loss account under 'Inclusive method' as per the mandate of section
145A, thereby, inter alia, increasing the purchase value with the above
customs duty. Then the AO will allow separate deduction for the above referred
sums to the extent not getting eventually deducted separately by way of
increased purchase price, as has been discussed above. At the same time, we
also direct the AO to make sure that such amount separately getting deducted
in this year does not get deduction once again in the next year. In the like
manner, the last year's similar deduction separately allowed should be taxed
in the computation of income of the current year", and by following the same
for AY 2007-08, vide para 14.1 the matter was set aside to the file of the
Assessing Officer to decide the issue afresh as per the above direction of the
ITAT in the appeal for the assessment year 2006-07 after affording opportunity
of being heard to the assessee. In the absence of any change of circumstances
or law, we think it fit to follow the same line of reasoning and set aside to
the file of the Assessing Officer to decide the issue  48 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
afresh as per the above direction in the appeal for the assessment year 2006-
07 and 2007-08 after affording opportunity of being heard to the assessee.
Ground Nos. 3.6 and 3.7 are, accordingly, allowed for statistical purposes."
Thus, the issue in the present year as well as of the earlier Assessment Years
is identical and hence we also deem it fit to follow the same reasoning and
set aside the issue to the file of the Assessing Officer to decide the issue
afresh as per the earlier assessment years. Needless to say, the assessee be
given opportunity of hearing by following principles of natural justice.
Ground No. 3.9 to 3.10 are partly allowed for statistical purpose.
34\. Ground No. 3.9 to 3.10 are partly allowed for statistical purpose.
35\. Ground No. 3.11 to 3.12 is in respect of Custom Duty and Excise Duty both
paid under protest. Custom duty paid under protest represented the duties paid
as per the additional demand raised by the statutory authorities, i.e. the
Excise Department and the Customs Department. Though the assessee has disputed
such additional demand and paid the amount under protest, in view of the
demand being in the nature of a statutory liability, the same represented
accrued/ crystallized liability. As per the mandate of section 43B of the Act,
the aforesaid additional excise duty and custom duty so actually paid under
protest was claimed as deduction on payment basis which has been disallowed by
the assessing officer. The Assessing Officer, following the orders for
preceding assessment years, disallowed the said claim on the ground that since
the assessee was contesting these liabilities and there was no finality
regarding the liabilities and that the same were not debited to the P&L A/c.
36\. The Ld. AR submitted that the Tribunal has held in assessee's own case
that, since the duty has been paid, deduction claimed under section 43B of the
Act has to be allowed. The Ld. AR relied upon the decision of Delhi High Court
in the case of CIT v. Dharampal Satyapal Sons (P.) Ltd. 50 DTR 287 wherein  49
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the High Court has held that amount paid by the assessee
against excise duty demand raised by excise authorities was allowable
deduction as it was statutory liability which was allowable on payment basis
under section 43B of the Act. Similarly, the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in
the case of Euro RSCG Advertising (P) Ltd v. ACIT [2013] 154 TTJ 389 (Mum)
held that service tax liability alongwith the interest paid on the basis of
the show cause notice issued by the service tax authorities, is allowable
deduction under section 43B of the Act in the year in which the payment was
made irrespective of the fact that such demand was paid under protest and the
matter was subjudice before the authorities. The issue stands covered in
favour of the assessee by the order of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case
for A.Y's 1999-00, 2000-01, 2001- 02, 2002-03 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and
2008-09.
37\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of the Assessing Officer.
38\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Tribunal in Assessee's own case held as under:
"3.28. With regard to the disallowance of claim for deduction under section
43B of the Act for a sum of Rs. 92,431 /- being Customs Duty paid under
protest, assessee submits that the Custom duty paid under protest represented
the duties paid as per the additional demand raised by the statutory
authorities, i.e. the Customs Department, and though they have disputed such
additional demand and paid the amount under protest, in view of the demand
being in the nature of a statutory liability, the same represented accrued/
crystallized liability. According to the assessee, as per the mandate of
section 43B of the Act, the aforesaid additional custom duty so actually paid
under protest was claimed as deduction on payment basis which has been
disallowed by the assessing officer. However, the assessing officer disallowed
the aforesaid following assessment order for the assessment year 2005-06. Ld.
AR invited our attention to the decision of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal
in the case of Euro RSCG Advertising (P) Ltd v.
50 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
ACIT : 154 TTJ 389 (Mum) wherein it was held that wherein the service tax
liability alongwith the interest was paid on the basis of show cause notice
issued by the service tax authorities, the same was allowable under section
43B in the year in which the payment was made irrespective of the fact that
such demand was paid under protest and the matter was subjudice before the
authorities. He further submitted that in similar circumstances the Honhle
Delhi High Court in the case of CIT v. Dharampal Satyapal Sons (P.) Ltd.: 50
DTR 287, held that the amount paid by the assessee against excise duty demand
raised by excise authorities was allowable deduction as it was statutory
liability which was allowable on payment basis under section 43B of the Act,
and also submitted that in assessee's own case for A.Y's 1999-00, 2000-01,
2001-02, 2002-03, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, coordinate Benches of this
Tribunal have held that, since the duty is paid, deduction claimed u/s 43B of
the Act has to be allowed.
3.29. This aspect of disallowance of claim for deduction under section 43B of
the Act for the amount of Customs Duty paid under protest has been one of the
subject of matters in assessee's own case for the AY 2006-07 and 2007- 08
successively, and for the AY 2006-07 vide para 5.5 of the order dated
24.8.2015, the following finding was returned by the Tribunal, "5.5. Next item
is Customs duty paid under protest amounting to Rs. 1,34,25,787. We have
discussed similar issue supra while dealing with 'Excise duty paid under
protest' by holding that first the Profit and loss account be recast as per
'Inclusive method' in terms of section 145A and then some adjustments as
stated above be separately made. Such directions are fully applicable pro
tanto to the customs duty paid under protest. The AO is directed to follow the
same."
3.30. While following the same for AY 2007-08, Tribunal set aside the matter
to the file of the Assessing Officer to decide it afresh as decided above by
the ITAT after affording opportunity of being heard to the assessee.
51 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
3.31. Ld. DR fairly concedes that the decision of the Tribunal on the issue of
'Excise duty paid under protest', in A.Y. 2006-07 and 2007- O8 was acceptable
to the Revenue, and accordingly, no further appeal was preferred on this
issue. In these circumstances, while following the same, we set aside Ground
No. 3.8 to the file of the Assessing Officer to decide it afresh as decided by
the ITAT for the Assessment Years 2006-07 and 2007-08 after affording
opportunity of being heard to the assessee." Thus, the issue is squarely
covered by the decision of the Tribunal in Assessee's own case, therefore, we
set side this issue to the file of the Assessing Officer to decide it afresh
as decided by the Tribunal in earlier Assessment Years. Needless to say, the
assessee be given opportunity of hearing. Ground No. 3.11 to 3.12 are partly
allowed for statistical purpose.
39\. In result, Ground No. 3.11 to 3.12 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
40\. Ground No. 3.13. is General in nature hence, dismissed.
41\. Ground No. 4 to 4.2 is regarding non allowing withdrawal of add back u/s
43B. The assessee company had in the instant assessment year 2009-10 offered
an amount of Rs.69,50,54,573/- in its return of income. This amount represents
amounts received back/ adjusted in the profit and loss account during the
financial year 2008-09 out of the amounts which have already been claimed as
deduction on payment basis under section 43B of the Act in the preceding
assessment years. This amount was offered to tax by the assessee during AY
2009-10 on the presumption that deduction would be allowed in preceding years
on payment basis.
42\. The Ld. AR submitted that the aforesaid total amount has not been allowed
to the assessee on payment basis in the preceding assessment years and thus
the assessee has prayed that it should be allowed a withdrawal of  52 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 add back of the aforesaid amount. Not allowing withdrawal of add
back has resulted in the claim not being allowed in any year. To the extent
the assessee's claim under Section 43B of the Act are allowed in the earlier
assessment years out of the said amount of Rs.69,50,54,573/-, the same would
certainly be liable to be added to the assessable income of the present year.
Withdrawal of add back has also been allowed by ITAT in assessee case for AY
2000- 01, 2004-05, AY 2005-06, AY 2006-07 and AY 2008-09. Department Appeal in
AY 2004-05 on this issue has not been admitted by Delhi High Court vide order
dated 28- 01-2010.
43\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of TPO/AO.
44\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that the Tribunal in Assessee's own case held as under:
"Grounds No. 4 to 4.2 Not allowing withdrawal of add back u/s 43B:
4\. Adverting to Ground No 4 to 4.2, in the AY 2008-09 the assessee company
offered an amount of Rs. 117,72,92,005/- in its return of income representing
the amounts received back or adjusted in the Profit and Loss Account during FY
2007-08 out of the amounts which have already been claimed as deduction on
payment basis u/s 43B of the Act in the preceding assessment years, and this
amount was offered to tax by the assessee during AY 2008-09 on the presumption
that deduction would be allowed in preceding years on payment basis. It is
pleaded that the aforesaid total amount of Rs.117,72,92,005/- has not been
allowed to the assessee on payment basis in the preceding assessment years and
thus the assessee has prayed that it be allowed to withdraw the add back of
the said amount and not allowing withdrawal of add back has resulted in the
claim not being allowed in  53 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 any year. Ld. AR brought
to our notice that assessee's claim under Section 43B deduction was allowed in
the earlier assessment years, as such, said amount of Rs. 117,72,92,005/-
would certainly be liable to be added to the assessable income of the present
year. It is submitted on behalf of the assessee that the withdrawal of write-
back has been allowed by AO for AY2007-08, which has been confirmed by DRP. He
submitted that identical claims have been allowed in the assessee's own case
by ITAT in AY 1999-2000, 2000-01 AY 2005-06 and AY 2006- 07 and by CIT(A) in
AY 2001-02 and 2002-03.
4.1. As submitted by the Ld. AR, in the order dt 24.08.2015 for the AY
2006-07, this Tribunal in assessee's own case, vide paragraph No 6.3 and 6.4
dealt with this issue in the following manner:
"6.3. Ground nos. 4 to 6.1 deal with a sum of Rs. 1,41,59,08,897, which has
been stated to be a total of certain amounts claimed by the assessee as
deductible in the preceding year u/s 43B as excise duty and customs duty and
voluntarily offered for taxation in the current year's income. The ld. AR
contended that since such deductions have been denied by the AO, the
corresponding offering of the same to tax in the current year, be eliminated.
6.4. We agree with the ld. AR that one amount cannot be taxed twice. It is but
natural that if an amount claimed as deduction by the assessee in the earlier
year has not been allowed, then on the assessee's suo motu offering of it as
an item of income for the current year on the strength of deduction claimed in
the earlier year, which finally stands denied, should not be charged to tax.
On being called upon to furnish the detail of such amount, it was stated that
it, inter alia, includes a sum of Rs.71,63,89,449, which is subject matter of
ground no. 3.5, that we have discussed immediately hereinbefore. We note that
apart from the sustenance of disallowance of Rs.71.63 crore in the preceding
year, there is no other disallowance u/s 43B which has been upheld by the
Tribunal. It is overt that all other disallowances made by the AO u/s 43B have
been deleted by the tribunal. The ld. AR could not furnish any detail of the
remaining amount of Rs.69.96 crore (Rs.141.59 crore minus Rs.71.63 crore),
allegedly finally disallowed u/s 43B of the Act by the tribunal in the
preceding year. It is simple and plain that if the tribunal has allowed
deduction for the amounts disallowed by the AO in the preceding year, then the
same are rightly chargeable to tax in the current year. This ground is,
therefore, dismissed, subject to our decision on  54 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
ground no. 3.5 in granting deduction of Rs.71,63,89,449, representing last
year's unutilized Modvat credit which was claimed by the assessee as
deductible u/s 43B but disallowed by the AO and also the tribunal."
4.2. For the AY 2007-08, though the AO refused to allow the deductions claimed
by the assessee under section 43B of the Act, by order dated 20-05-2016 the
Tribunal considered the case of the assessee and set aside the matter to the
file of AO, and the relief on this aspect is dependent upon the findings of
the AO while implementing the said order, as such we deem it just and proper
to direct the AO to consider this aspect also in the light of implementing the
order of this Tribunal for the AY 2007-08. These grounds are, therefore,
allowed for statistical purpose.
Thus, the issue is squarely covered by the decision of the Tribunal in
Assessee's own case, therefore, we set side this issue to the file of the
Assessing Officer to decide it afresh as decided by the Tribunal in earlier
Assessment Years. Needless to say, the assessee be given opportunity of
hearing. Ground No. 4 to 4.2 are partly allowed for statistical purpose.
45\. In result, Ground No. 4 to 4. 2 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
46\. Ground Nos. 5 to 5.5 are relating to disallowance u/s 14A. During the
year under consideration, the assessee earned dividend income of Rs.
143,99,95,324/-, which was claimed as exempt from tax under sections 10(34)
and 10(35) of the Act. On the basis of the said fact, the Assessing Officer
concluded that provisions of section 14A of the Act becomes applicable to the
assessee and consequently, expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income
is required to be disallowed, while computing taxable income. The Assessing
officer applied the method prescribed in Rule 8D of the Income-tax  55 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 Rules, 1962 (the 'Rules') and determined the amount disallowable
under section 14A of the Act at Rs.9,96,70,322/-, comprising of the following:
     S. NO.              Particulars                        Amount in        Rs.    (in
                                                            millions)
     1          Direct expenditure                          Nil
     2          Interest expenditure incurred during        18.44 million
                the year (Rs. 148 milions) attributed
                in the ratio of average value of
                investments resulting in exempt
                income to average value of total assets
     3          ½ % of average value of investments         81.23
                Total                                       99.67
The assessing officer made a net disallowance of Rs.8,35,98,603/- after giving
benefit of the suo moto disallowance of Rs. 16,071,719/- made by the assessee.
47\. The Ld. AR submitted that the aforesaid disallowance made in the final
assessment order is, in our respectful submission, without judicious
appreciation of the facts and correct position of law, and is liable to be
deleted for the reasons elaborated hereunder:
a) Re: Assessing officer erred in applying Rule 8D in present case In terms of
the provisions of section 14A of the Act, only expenditure incurred, having
relation with earning of exempt income, is not an allowable deduction under
the provisions of the Act. The phrase "expenditure incurred" used in the
aforesaid section refers to actual expenditure, which has proximate nexus with
exempt income, and not some imaginary or notional expenses, for the purposes
of disallowance under that Section. In view thereof, the provisions of section
14A are applicable only if the assessing officer at the first place finds that
the assessee has actually incurred expenses, which have proximate nexus with
earning of exempt dividend income and not otherwise. In other words, the onus
is on the assessing officer to find proximate nexus of expenses with earning
of  56 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 exempt income, before rejecting the claim of
assessee and computing disallowance under section 14A of the Act. The
provisions of sub-section (2) and (3) to section 14A, which empowers the
assessing officer to compute disallowance as per provisions of Rule 8D of the
Rules, w.e.f assessment year 2008-09, also provides that disallowance as per
provisions of Rule 8D can be computed, only if the assessing officer, having
regard to the accounts of assessee is not satisfied with the correctness of
the claim of the assessee. In other words, even from assessment year 2008-09
and onwards, the assessing officer can compute disallowance under section 14A
as per the provisions of Rule 8D, only if assessing officer, having regard to
accounts of assessee, reaches a finding, that assessee has incurred expenses
over and above expenses suo-motu disallowed by him.. In the absence of such
finding, the assessing officer does not have power to compute disallowance
under section 14A of the Act as per provisions of Rule 8D, even for assessment
years 2008-09 and onwards. Reliance in this regard is placed on following
decisions:
> • CIT vs. Walfort Share & Stock Brokers: 326 ITR 1 (SC) • Godrej & Boyce
> Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. DCIT : 394 ITR 449 (SC) - affirming Godrej & Boyce Mfg. Co.
> Ltd. v. CIT: 328 ITR 81 (Bom.) • Maxopp Investment Ltd. vs. CIT: 347 ITR 272
> (Del.) Attention is also invited to the decision of Punjab & Haryana High
> Court in the case of CIT vs. Hero Cycles: 323 ITR 518, wherein, too, High
> Court held that disallowance under section 14A of the Act can be made only
> if assessing officer establishes proximate nexus of expenditure with exempt
> income. It has similarly been held in the following decisions:
• CIT v. Metalman Auto P. Ltd.: 336 ITR 434 (P&H) • CIT v. Reliance Utilities
and Power Ltd.: 313 ITR 340 (Bom) • CIT v. Torrent Power Ltd.: 363 ITR 474
(Guj).
In view of the above, it is respectfully submitted that the provisions of sub-
section (2) and sub-section (3) of section 14A of the Act, as discussed supra,
permits the assessing officer to apply the procedure of computing disallowance
57 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 by applying the formula prescribed in Rule 8D of the
Rules, if and only if, the assessing officer records the satisfaction that the
expenditure disallowed by the assessee under that section is not correct
and/or sufficient. In the present case, the Assessing Officer , it is
submitted, primarily held that:
> actual earning/ receipt of dividend income is not essential; Rule 8D has
> been brought in the Statute to mitigate the calculation of disallowance;
> assessee-company is paying huge interest on loans, which could have been
> reduced by not making such investments;
> fact that assessee, suo motu, made disallowance goes to show that the
> assessee was conscious of the fact that it had incurred some expenditure for
> acquiring shares.
b) Re: No disallowance was warranted under section 14A in present case The
assessee, it will be appreciated, is an operating company engaged in
manufacture of automobiles. The entire expenditure incurred was in relation to
the manufacturing operations of the assessee and the assessing officer has
failed to bring on record any evidence/ material to demonstrate that any part
of such expenditure was relatable to the exempt income.
c) Re: Disallowance out of interest expenditure Insofar as interest
expenditure was concerned, interest paid by the assessee was on account of the
following:
         Particulars                                Amount (Rs. Millions)
         Interest on-
         (a) advances from dealers                  79
         (b) Others including interest on export 69
         credit/overdraft
         Total                                      148
                                             58                       ITA No. 467/Del/2014
On perusal of the aforesaid, it will kindly be noticed that the aforesaid
expenditure actually related to the manufacturing operations of the assessee.
Borrowed funds available with the assessee, as a matter of fact, were utilized
for business operations and not used for making the investments. It is further
submitted that interest free own funds available with the assessee far exceeds
the investment made in shares/securities on which exempt dividend income was
received. The assessee, as on the last date of the relevant assessment year,
had investments amounting to Rs.317 crores, which is substantially less than
the opening investments of Rs.518 crores (refer page 151 of PB Vol 1).
Further, on perusal of the balance sheet for the relevant year (refer page 151
of PB Vol I), it will kindly be noticed that the following interest free funds
were available at disposal of the assessee:
    a)    Share Capital                          Rs. 145 Crores
    b)    Opening Reserves and Surplus           Rs. 8,270 crores
    c)    Current year's cash profits            Rs. 10,797 crores
Further, net cash from operating activities for the year under consideration
amounted to Rs. 1193 crores (refer page 153 of PB Vol I). It will, thus, be
appreciated that interest free funds available with the assessee (both opening
as well as closing) far exceeds the total investments. In the aforesaid facts,
it cannot, it is submitted, be concluded that investments were made from
borrowed funds; on the contrary, it is clearly evident that the borrowed funds
had also reduced during the relevant assessment year. Further, it is submitted
that in case of mixed pool of funds, the correct method to establish source of
investment would be to consider the macro fund/ cash flow position during the
year and if the assessee had sufficient surplus funds available, presumption
should be drawn in favour of the assessee that surplus funds have been
utilized for making investments. Reliance in this regard is also placed on the
following decisions, wherein it has been held that where assessee had
sufficient funds/ deposits for advancing interest free loans or making
investment in  59 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 shares, etc., and there is nothing on
record to show that borrowed funds have been directly utilized for such
purpose, a presumption in favour of the assessee can be drawn with respect to
utilization of interest free and borrowed funds:

case of CIT v. UTI Bank Ltd: 215 Taxman 8 (Mag.) held that where there are
sufficient interest free funds to meet tax free investments, they are presumed
to be made from interest free funds and not loaned funds and no disallowance
can be made under section 14A of the Act. The Supreme Court has dismissed the
Revenue's SLP in Civil Appeal No. 468/2014 against the aforesaid decision. In
the case of mixed funds, the option is with the assessee to appropriate fund
and expenditure in a manner most favourable to the assessee. While following
the ratio emanating from the aforesaid decisions, it has been held in the
following cases, that interest expenditure cannot be disallowed under section
14A of the Act, where the assessee had sufficient surplus funds and there was
no finding by the assessing officer of any direct nexus of borrowed funds with
investments:

squarely applicable in the facts of the present case inasmuch as total
investment made is much lower than interest free funds available with the
assessee and hence, there is no basis to hold that any part of interest
bearing funds would have been utilized for making investment.
Re: Administrative Expenses It is submitted that since no portion of the
expenditure debited to the profit and loss account had proximate nexus with
investments in shares or earning of dividend income therefrom, neither the
same has been established by the assessing officer in the assessment order,
there is no warrant for making any disallowance under section 14A of the Act,
leave alone attribution @ lA% of average value of investments, in accordance
with provisions of Rule 8D of the Rules. In fact, the assessee, on a
conservative basis suo-motu disallowed an amount of Rs. 1,60,71,719/- on
account of salary cost and administrative expenditure following an objective
method of computation.
61 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
d) Re: Incorrect computation of disallowance under section 14A Without
prejudice, the Ld. AR submitted that, the disallowance computed under section
14A of the Act is incorrect since while computing disallowance as per Rule 8D,
entire investments have been considered, without excluding investments not
resulting in any exempt income during the year under consideration.
e) Re- Investments not resulting in exempt income to be excluded In the
following decisions, it has consistently been held disallowance under section
14A of the Act is only to be made only if there is exempt income and not
otherwise:

Morgan Stanley India Securities Pvt. Ltd. : ITA No. 114/Mum/2013 • (Mum.) VS
ACIT v. M. Baskaran: 152 ITD 844 (Chn. Trib.) Specific reliance in this regard
is placed on the decision of the Kolkata Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
REI Agro Ltd vs. DCIT: 144 ITD 141. In the said case, in A.Y .2008-09, the
assessee had invested Rs.103 crores in shares on which it earned tax-free
dividends of Rs.1.3 lakhs. The assessee claimed that though its borrowings had
increased by Rs.122 crores, the said investments were funded out of own funds.
It further claimed that no expenditure had been incurred to earn the dividends
thereby warranting a disallowance u/s 14A of the Act. However, the AO applied
Rule 8D and computed the disallowance at  62 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 Rs.4 crore.
On appeal by the assessee, the CIT(A) reduced the disallowance to Rs.26 lakh.
Appeal filed by the Revenue against the aforesaid decision has been dismissed
by the Calcutta High Court as not giving rise to any substantial question of
law in appeal No. GA No.3581 of 2013. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case
of ACB India Limited v. ACIT: 374 ITR 108, similarly held that only investment
which actually resulted in exempt dividend income has to be considered for the
purpose of computing the disallowance as per Rule 8D of the Rules. In view of
the aforesaid, the Ld. AR submitted that the assessing officer erred in
considering the entire investments while computing disallowance u/s 14A read
with rule 8D. The disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D is to be in relation
to the income which does not form part of the total income and this can be
done only by taking into consideration the investment which has given rise to
this income which does not form part of the total income. The ITAT for AY's
2001-02, 2002-03 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 has remanded the matter
back to the assessing officer for fresh adjudication. Further, the Assessing
Officer has, in the appeal effect order for the Assessment Year 2006-07,
deleted the entire disallowance made under section 14A of the Act. The
aforesaid issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the decision
of the Delhi High Court for assessment years 1999-00 (ITA No. 250/2005) and
2000-01 (ITA No.976/2005), wherein the High Court has held that onus is on the
Revenue to establish proximate nexus of expenses with earning of exempt income
and that no disallowance of interest was called for under section 14A of the
Act. In the aforesaid circumstances, the assessing officer erred in
disallowing Rs.8,35,98,603/- in the assessment order and the same, therefore,
calls for being deleted. Alternatively, the assessing officer may be directed
to re-compute the disallowance under section 14A of the Act.
48\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
49\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. It is pertinent
to note that though the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Assessee's own case held
63 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 that there was no question of disallowance of any
amount on account of interest under Section 14A of the Act, but the Tribunal
in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09 held as under:
"Ground No 6.0 to 6.4 disallowance of Rs. 7,43,27,349/- under section 14A of
the Act
6\. Adverting to the aspect of disallowance u/s 14A of the Act, we find from
the record and contentions of the parties that, during the year under
consideration, the appellant earned dividend income of Rs.166,83,50,967/-,
which was claimed as exempt from tax under sections 10(34) and 10(35) of the
Act, on the basis of which, the assessing officer concluded that provisions of
section 14A of the Act becomes applicable to the assessee and consequently,
expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income is required to be
disallowed, while computing taxable income and by placing reliance upon the
decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Daga Capital
Management Pvt. Ltd: 312 ITR (AT) 01(Mum.), the assessing ITA No.-
6021/Del/2012 officer applied the method prescribed in Rule 8D of the Income-
tax Rules, 1962 (the 'Rules') and determined the amount disallowable under
section 14A of the Act at Rs.7,43,27,349/-, comprising of the following:-
       S.      Particulars                                             Amount in Rs.

6.1. It is contended on behalf of the assessee that the disallowance made on
this count in the final assessment order is without judicious appreciation of
the facts and correct position of law, and is liable to be deleted. Ld. AR
based his arguments on three reasons:
1\. the assessing officer, in the assessment order, has not pointed out even a
single expenditure being incurred by the appellant during the year, having
relation/ proximate nexus with exempt dividend income earned during the year;
2\. no investments were made from borrowed funds;
3\. while computing disallowance as per Rule 8D, entire investments have been
considered, without excluding the strategic long-term business investments,
not for the purpose of earning dividend but for furthering the operations/
business of the company; and investments not resulting in any exempt income
during the year under consideration;
6.2. On the first aspect, basing on the provisions of section 14A it is
contended that even for assessment years 2008-09 and onwards, disallowance
under section 14A, as per provisions of Rule 8D of the Rules can be made only
if the assessing officer, having regard to the ITA No.- 6021/Del/2012 accounts
of the assessee, reaches a finding that assessee has incurred actual expenses,
which have proximate nexus with earning of exempt income. Ld. AR submitted
that the onus is on the assessing officer to find proximate nexus of expenses
with earning of exempt income, before rejecting the claim of assessee and
computing disallowance under section 14A of the Act, and the provisions of
sub-section (2) and (3) to section 14A, which empowers the assessing officer
to compute disallowance as per provisions of Rule 8D of the Rules, w.e.f.
assessment year 2008-09, also  65 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 provides that
disallowance as per provisions of Rule 8D can be computed, only if the
assessing officer, having regard to the accounts of assessee is not satisfied
with the claim of assessee that no expenditure in relation to exempt income
has been incurred by assessee. In other words, even from assessment year
2008-09 and onwards, the assessing officer can compute disallowance under
section 14A as per the provisions of Rule 8D, only if assessing officer,
having regard to accounts of assessee, reaches a finding, that assessee has
incurred expenses, having proximate nexus with earning of exempt dividend
income. According to the Ld. AR in the absence of such finding, as is held in
CIT vs. Walfort Share & Stock Brokers: 326 ITR 1 (SC), Godrej & Boyce Mfg. Co.
Ltd. v. DCIT : 394 ITR 449 (SC) - affirming Godrej & Boyce Mfg. Co. Ltd. v.
CIT: 328 ITR 81 (Bom.), Maxopp Investment Ltd. vs. CIT: 347 ITR 272 (Del.),
and Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of CIT vs. Hero Cycles: 323 ITR
518, assessing officer does not have power to compute disallowance under
section 14A as per provisions of Rule 8D, even for assessment years 2008-09
and onwards. He submitted that similar view is taken in CIT v. Metalman Auto
P. Ltd.: 336 ITR 434 (P&H) , CIT v. Reliance Utilities and Power Ltd.: 313 ITR
340 (Bom) , CIT v. Torrent Power Ltd.: 363 ITR 474 (Guj).
6.3. Reference can also be made to the decisions in Chemical & Mettallurgical
Design Co. Ltd : ITA No. 803/2008 (Delhi), CIT Vs Ms. Sushma Kapoor : 319 ITR
299 (Delhi), ACIT v. Eicher Limited: 101 TTJ 369 (Del.) , Maruti Udyog Limited
V. DCIT: 92 ITD 119 (Del.), on the aspect of section 14A of the Act, wherein
it has been held that without any cogent basis and material on record, no
artificial/ ad-hoc disallowance is permissible for expenses incurred by the
assessee, and the legal position that emerges from the these decisions is
that: (a) there must be some actual expenditure incurred; and (b) such
expenditure must be incurred "in relation to" the earning of exempt income,
which means that there must be some nexus between the actual expenditure and
the exempt income. In this regard he placed reliance on SIL Investment Ltd. vs
ACIT: 148 TTJ 213 (Del.) , M/s Multi Commodity Exchange of (India)  66 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 Ltd. Vs. DCIT: ITA No.1050/Mum/2010 (Mum.), M/s. Auchtel Products

Agribusiness (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT: 132 ITD 549 (Mum.) also.
6.4. In the present case of the assessee, the assessing officer has simply
applied the procedure prescribed in Rule 8D of the Rules to compute the amount
disallowable under section 14A of the Act without appreciating that in the
present case, no part of interest and/or administrative expenditure was
incurred in relation to exempt income.
6.5. Further the assessing officer, in the assessment order, has not pointed
out even a single expenditure being incurred by the appellant during the year,
having relation/ proximate nexus with exempt dividend income earned during the
year. The assessing officer, it is submitted, invoked the provisions of
section 14A read with Rule 8D of the Rules in a mechanical manner, which, it
is respectfully submitted is beyond jurisdiction.
6.6. For the principle that disallowance under section 14A of the Act cannot
be sustain without any satisfaction being recorded by the assessing officer
before applying Rule 8D of the Rules, reliance is placed on the decisions
reported in Pr.CIT vs. U.K. Paints (India) (P.) Ltd.: 244 Taxman 309 (Del.),
Joint Investments P. Ltd. v. CIT: 275 CTR 471 (Del.), Minda Investments Ltd.
vs. DCIT: 138 TTJ 240 ( Del.) , ACIT vs. MMTC Limited: ITA No. 724/Del/2014
(Del. Trib.), REI Agro Ltd vs. DCIT: 144 ITD 141 (Revenue appeal dismissed by
Calcutta High Court in appeal No. GA No.3581 of  67 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
2013)., CIT v. Abhishek Industries Ltd \- 231 Taxman 85 (P&H), 6.7. Second
contention raised on behalf of the assessee is that the assessee is an
operating company engaged in manufacture of automobiles and the entire
expenditure incurred was in relation to the manufacturing operations of the
assessee and the assessing officer has failed to bring on record any evidence/
material to demonstrate that any part of such expenditure was relatable to the
exempt income. It is submitted on behalf of the assessee that the entire
expenditure incurred by the assessee was actually related to the manufacturing
operations, all the borrowed funds available with the appellant were utilized
for business operations and not used for making the investments and that the
interest free own funds available with the appellant far exceeds the
investment made in shares/securities on ITA No.- 6021/Del/2012 which exempt
dividend income was received. During the year interest paid by the appellant
was on account of the following:
             Particulars                                   Amount      (Rs. millions)
          a) Advances from dealers                             67
          b) Others including interest on
          cash credit/overdraft                       61
          Total:                                      128
6.8. Whereas as is evident from the balance sheet the following interest free
funds were available at disposal of the assessee:
           (a) Share Capital                           Rs. 144 crores
           (b) Reserves and Surplus                        Rs. 8,271 crores
          Total                                        Rs. 8,415 crores
6.9. Ld. AR submitted that in case of mixed pool of funds, the correct method
to establish source of investment would be to consider the macro fund/ cash
flow position during the year and basing on the decisions in East India
Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. CIT: 224 ITR 627 (SC), Indian Explosives Ltd. V.
68 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
CIT: 147 ITR 392 (Cal.), Woolcombers of India Ltd. v. CIT: 134 ITR 219 (Cal.)
- approved by Supreme Court in the case of East India Pharmaceutical Works
Ltd. v. CIT: 224 ITR 627, Alkali & Chemical Corp. of India v. CIT: (1986) 161
ITR 820 (Cal.), CIT v. Reliance Utilities and Power Ltd.: 313 ITR 340 (Bom.),

Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd : 358 ITR 323 (Guj), Hero Honda
Finlease Ltd vs. ACIT: ITA No. 3726 & 6102/Del/2012 (Del) he submitted that if
the assessee had sufficient surplus funds available, presumption should be
drawn in favour of the assessee that surplus funds have been utilized for
making investments. He submitted that the Gujarat High Court in the case of
CIT v. UTI Bank Ltd: 215 Taxman 8 (Mag.) held that where there are ITA
No.-6021/Del/2012 sufficient interest free funds to meet tax free investments,
they are presumed to be made from interest free funds and not loaned funds and
no disallowance can be made under section 14A of the Act, and the Hon'ble Apex
Court has dismissed the revenue's SLP in Civil Appeal No. 468/2014 against the
aforesaid decision.
6.10. He contended that in the case of mixed funds, the option is with the
assessee to appropriate fund and expenditure in a manner most favorable to the
assessee, and by placing reliance on Godrej & Boyce Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. DCIT :
394 ITR 449 (SC), HDFC Bank Ltd v. DCIT: 366 ITR 505 (Bom), HDFC Bank Ltd v.

that interest expenditure cannot be disallowed under section 14A of the Act,
where the assessee had sufficient surplus funds and there was no finding by
the assessing officer of any direct nexus of borrowed funds with investments:
6.11. Lastly it is contended on behalf of the assessee that the disallowance
computed under section 14A of the Act is incorrect since while computing
disallowance as per Rule 8D, entire investments have been considered, without
excluding the following:
(a) strategic long-term business investments, not for the purpose of earning
dividend but for furthering the operations/ business of the company; and
(b) investments not resulting in any exempt income during the year under
consideration.
6.12. Reliance is placed on the decisions in CIT v. Oriental Structural
Engineers Pvt. Ltd.: 216 Taxman 92 (Del.) , Cheminvest Ltd v. CIT : 379 ITR 33
(Del HC), Eicher Goodearth Ltd. v. CIT: 378 ITR 28 (Del.), VA Tech Escher Wyss

v. Morgan Stanley India Securities Pvt. Ltd: ITA No.114/Mum/2013 (Mum.Trib.),
in support of the contention that while computing average investments,
strategic long-term business  70 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 investments not for
earning dividend but for promoting manufacturing operations ought to have been
excluded. In view of the above, without prejudice to their contention that no
disallowance is warranted under section 14Aof the Act, Ld. AR prayed that, the
assessing officer may be directed to re- compute disallowance under that
section after reducing the strategic long- term trade investments.
6.13. For the principle that disallowance under section 14A of the Act is only
to be made only if there is exempt income and not otherwise, support is
derived from the decisions in ACB India Ltd. v. ACIT: 374 ITA No.-
6021/Del/2012 ITR 108 (Del.), Cheminvest Ltd. v. CIT : 379 ITR 33 (Del.), CIT

(All), Interglobe Enterprises v. DCIT: ITA No.1362 & 1032/Del./2013 (Del.
Trib.) - affirmed by Delhi High Court in ITA No.456 of 2016, REI Agro Ltd vs.
DCIT: 144 ITD 141 (Kol. Trib.) - Department appeal dismissed in CIT v. REI
Agro Ltd. : I.T.A.T No.220 of 2013 (Cal. HC), DCIT v. Morgan Stanley India
Securities Pvt. Ltd. : ITA No. 114/Mum/2013 (Mum.), ACIT v. M. Baskaran: 152
ITD 844 (Chn. Trib.), and it is submitted that the assessing officer erred in
considering the entire investments while computing disallowance u/s 14A read
with rule 8D. The disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D is to be in relation
to the income which does not form part of the total income and this can be
done only by taking into consideration the investment which has given rise to
this income which does not form part of the total income.
6.14. Basing on the contentions and submissions made for the AY 2006-07 and
2006-07, Ld. DR argued on the aspects whether earning of exempt income is
necessary for disallowance u/s 14A, relationship of expenditure  71 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 with exempt income, dominant object or purpose test, what does it
mean by expenditure incurred etc by placing extensive reliance on the
decisions in Maxopp Investments, Walfort share and Stock Brokers P Ltd., DBDT
Circular No 5/2014 etc. 6.15. In this matter, assessee earned dividend income
of Rs.166,83,50,967/-
, which was claimed as exempt from tax under sections 10(34) and 10(35) of the
Act. However, according to the assessee, they did not incur any expenditure in
earning this. Making investment, maintaining or continuing with any investment
in a ITA No.-6021/Del/2012 particular share/mutual fund etc. and the time when
to exit from one investment to another are all the activities requiring well
coordinated and well informed management decisions, involving not only inputs
from various sources but it also involves acumen of senior management
functionaries. There are incidental administrative expenses on collecting the
information, research, etc. which helps in arriving at particular investment
decisions and these expenses, relating to earning of income are embedded in
the indirect expenses without which it would not be possible to carry out this
herculean task. It, therefore, cannot be said that no expenditure at all
incurred to earn Rs.166,83,50,967/-, when huge amounts to a tune of Rs. 8,415
crores was available with the assessee. By looking into these factors, Ld. AO
proceeded to hold that Rule 14A is applicable. In these circumstances, we are
of the considered opinion that the AO is justified in taking the view that the
plea of the assessee that no expenditure was incurred for earning the exempt
income cannot be accepted, and to proceed with the application of the formula
prescribed under Rule 8D of the Rules, which is in force from the AY 2008-09.
6.16. Adverting to the arguments of the Ld. AR on the aspects of interest
expenses relevant under Rule 8(ii) of the Rules and the reckoning of the
investment amount relevant for 8D(iii), on a consideration of the same in the
light of the principles of law laid down by the Court, as stated supra, we  72
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 agree with the submissions made on behalf of the assessee
that insofar as the interest expense under Rule 8D(ii) is concerned, it has to
be determined after examination of the macro fund/ cash flow position during
the year and if the assessee had sufficient surplus funds available,
presumption should be drawn in favour of the assessee that surplus funds have
been utilized for making investments, and while ITA No.-6021/Del/2012
calculating the disallowance under Rule 8D(iii) has to be calculated in
relation to the income which does not form part of the total income and this
can be done only by taking into consideration the investment which has given
rise to this income which does not form part of the total income after
reducing the strategic long- term trade investments. We, therefore, deem it
just and proper to set aside the impugned order on this score and send the
matter to the file of AO for making disallowance u/s 14A, in accordance with
the view taken above."
The disallowance u/s 14A read with rule 8D is to be in relation to the income
which does not form part of the total income and this can be done only by
taking into consideration the investment which has given rise to this income
which does not form part of the total income. This aspect was not properly
verified by the Assessing Officer in the present Assessment year as well.
Thus, the issue is squarely covered by the decision of the Tribunal in
Assessee's own case, therefore, we set side this issue to the file of the
Assessing Officer to decide it afresh as decided by the Tribunal in earlier
Assessment Years. Needless to say, the assessee be given opportunity of
hearing. Ground No. 5 to 5.5 are partly allowed for statistical purpose.
50\. In result, Ground No. 5 to 5.5 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
51\. Ground No. 6 to 6.5 are regarding Sales Tax Subsidy claimed as capital
receipt from the total income. The assessee had, for the year under
consideration received sales tax concessions amounting to Rs.7,03,81,097/-.
The said amount representing capital receipt was, however, erroneously  73 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 included in the gross total income while filing original
return of income. In view of the decision of Supreme Court in the case of CIT
vs Ponni Sugars and Chemicals Ltd: 306 ITR 392/ 174 Taxman 87 (SC) the
assessee revised return on 27.03.2010 and reduced Rs.7,03,81,097/- received on
account of subsidy from the total income. It was, thus, claimed that the
aforesaid receipt, being in the nature of capital receipt, is not includible
in the total income, which has not been accepted by the assessing officer. The
assessing officer, in the assessment order, held that sales tax amount
retained/ received by the assessee was revenue in nature and consequently,
taxable under provisions of the Act.
52\. The Ld. AR submitted that the aforesaid incentive/ subsidy is in the
nature of capital receipt not liable to tax under the provisions of the Act.
The State Government of Haryana announced the Industrial Policy, 1999
("Policy"), which was notified on 11.11.1999, which was aimed at larger public
purpose of promoting industrial growth and increasing employment opportunities
by incentivizing fresh investment/ substantial expansion and creating an
investor friendly enabling environment that facilitates the industry to move
strongly to the front ranks of global competition. Accordingly, sales tax
concessions were to be provided to new units and also industrial units
undergoing expansion/ diversification. Pursuant to the aforesaid Policy,
Chapter IV-C was inserted in July, 2000 in the Haryana General Sales Tax
Rules' 1975, containing Rule 28C dealing with "Tax Concessions , Class of
Industries, Period and Other Conditions". In the aforesaid background, the
assessee had undertaken industrial expansion in terms of the Rule 28C of
Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975\. The High Powered Committee,
thereafter, in its meeting held on 14.06.2001, granted sales tax concession to
the assessee, whereby the assessee company was required to pay 50% of the
sales tax collected on sales of finished products from expanded unit and,
retain balance 50% of the tax so collected, subject to maximum permissible
benefit of Rs.564.35 crores. The letter/ communication received from Director
of Industries, Haryana intimating the aforesaid decision, clearly referred to
concession being granted "only in respect of vehicles rolled out of  74 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 production capacity of 70,000 vehicles added as a result of
first expansion". Pursuant thereto, the assessee was issued entitlement
certificate dated 01.08.2001 under rule 28C of Haryana General Sales Tax
Rules, 1975 to avail sales tax concession to the extent of Rs.564.35 crores
during the period 01.08.2001 to 31.07.2015. The Ld. AR submitted that that the
incentive/ subsidy was granted to the assessee for undertaking substantial
expansion of existing industry in line with the larger public objective of the
Policy to promote industrialization and employment generation and not to
supplement trading receipts, which is, it is respectfully submitted, clearly
in the nature of a capital receipt, not liable to tax. The Ld. AR pointed out
that in terms of sub-rule (5)(b) of Rule 28C, the decision to grant tax
concession to a prestigious unit (the category in which the assessee falls) is
given on the basis of factors like employment generation, impact on overall
industrial growth, etc. The underlying objective of conferring the benefit
under Rule 28C, clearly proves beyond any doubt the fact that the avowed
intent/ purpose of granting the concession is industrial development of the
State and employment generation. During the relevant assessment year, the
assessee accordingly retained Rs.7,03,81,097/- out of the sales tax collected
on sales of finished products from expanded unit and claimed it as capital
receipt not liable to tax. The assessing officer, however, did not appreciate
the correct position in law and disallowed the entire amount holding it as
revenue in nature. In view of the objects of the scheme, the Ld. AR submitted
that the sales tax exemption/incentive was given for promoting industrial
growth of existing industrial units and creating employment opportunities. The
Ld. AR that the incentives received under the scheme by way of exemption from
payment of certain taxes was just a mode adopted to disburse the incentive/
subsidy by the State Government. It is settled law that the taxation of
subsidy, by whatever name called, is determined by the purpose for which the
subsidy is granted and not the form / mode / manner in which the subsidy is
received / disbursed. The Supreme Court in the case of V.S. S.V. Meenakshi
Achi: 60 ITR 253 held that the character of the subsidy in the hands of the
recipient is to be determined having regard to the purpose for which the
subsidy has been given. The aforesaid principle has been reiterated by the
Supreme Court in the case of  75 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 Sahney Steel and Press
Works Ltd. and Others vs. CIT: 228 ITR 253 wherein the Court held that the
character of a subsidy in the hands of the recipient, whether revenue or
capital, is to be determined having regard to the purpose for which the
subsidy is given. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Sahney Steel & Press
Works Ltd.'s case (supra) and Ponni Sugars & Chemicals Ltd.'s case (supra).
The Ld. AR relied upon the decision of the jurisdictional High Court in the
case of CIT vs. Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd. : ITA No. 193/2015 wherein the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court, on exactly similar facts decided the aforesaid issue
in favour of the assessee by holding that the sales tax subsidy received by
the assessee pursuant to Haryana Government's Scheme given for promoting the
local industry was in the nature of a capital receipt, not liable to tax under
the provisions of the Act. In that case, the assessee was a manufacturer of
catalysts for auto industries and was awarded an entitlement certificate under
Rule 28C of the Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975 which entitled the
assessee to a 50% sales tax concession for a period of ten years. The sales
tax subsidy was granted by Haryana Government under the initiative of
Government to promote investment in certain areas of Haryana and was available
to such industrial units which duly fulfilled the conditions prescribed under
Rule 28C of Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975\. Accordingly, the assessee
received Rs.2,00,64,000/-as subsidy from the Government for establishing a
manufacturing unit in Manesar (Haryana) which was claimed as a capital receipt
not liable to tax. The assessing officer disallowed the same treating it as a
revenue receipt. On appeal, the CIT(A) confirmed the order of the assessing
officer. On further appeal, the Tribunal reversed the order of the CIT(A)
after considering the decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Ponni Sugars
and Chemicals Ltd. (supra) and decision of the Delhi bench of the Tribunal in
the case of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. for AY 2005-06. The pertinent
observations of the Tribunal are as under:
"9. Discussing the issue in detail the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the
above cited case of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. has decided the issue in favour
of the  76 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 assessee with this finding that the subsidy in
question viewed from the angle of provisions of section 25A of the Haryana
General Sales Tax Act read with Industrial policy 1999 of the Govt, of
Haryana, are part of capital receipt given by the State Govt, for the purpose
of meeting the objective of Industrial Policy 1999 to attract investment and
to ensure growth of the existing industries so that they can generate
employment in industrial and allied sector by 20% It was held that the entire
package of incentive and concession should be read as focusing and providing
incentive for investment of industrial sector to achieve effective, meaningful
and speedy development of the State.
10\. In the case of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. the assessee had received sales
tax subsidy of Rs. 16,04,04,733/- during the asstt. year 2005-06. According to
the assessee the said receipt represented to be capital in nature. Therefore
it should be excluded from the taxable income. Before the Ld. CIT(A) the
subsequent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Ponni
Sugars and Chemical Ltd. (supra) was cited and the Ld. CIT(A) following the
ratio of the said decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court decided the issue in
favour of the assessee which was questioned by the revenue before the
Tribunal. It was argued that their lordship of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Ponni Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. (supra) have again reiterated that the
purpose for which the subsidy is given is only relevant for determining its
nature. The purpose of subsidy was to promote industrial development in the
State by promoting an establishment of new industrial unit or substantial
expansion of existing industrial units. Almost similar are the facts in the
present case before us as well as similar are the industrial policy 1999
issued by the department of industries, Govt. of Haryana and the relevant rule
28C of General Sales Tax Rules, 1975 as applicable in the case of present
assessee, whereby the assessee was required to pay 50% of the tax collected
and retain 50% subject to other conditions. Similarly in the case of present
assessee was issued entitlement certificate under Rule 28C of the Haryana
Sales Tax Rule 1975 to avail the sales tax concession during the period. The
Hon'ble  77 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 Supreme Court in the case of Ponni Sugar &
Chemicals Ltd has laid down some principles after elaborately discussing its
earlier judgment in the case of M/s. Sahney "Steel & Press Works (Supra). In
view of those principles the Tribunal in the case of Maruti Suzuki has decided
an identical issue in favour of the assessee under almost similar facts of the
case. Following the said decision we in the present case decide the issue in
favour of the assessee with this direction tot eh A.O to allow the claimed
sale tax subsidy receipt amount to Rs.2,00,64,000/- received by the assessee
during the year as capital receipt for the assessment. Ground NO. 2 is thus
allowed."
On revenue's appeal to the High Court, the order of the Tribunal was confirmed
by the High Court holding that if the purpose of the subsidy was to promote an
industry especially with special interest of development of capital
infrastructure, it should be treated as capital receipt. The Hon'ble High
Court observed as under:
> "This Court has considered the submissions and is of the opinion that the
> ITAT's impugned order has noted the relevant law. Crucially, Ponni Sugars
> (supra) is a later decision of the Supreme Court which had gone to deal with
> various authorities, including Sahney (supra). The Supreme Court has
> emphasized in each case the purpose for which subsidy or assistance is given
> by the State government or a public agency. If that is to promote an
> industry, especially with special interest of development of capital
> infrastructure, the amounts received are to be treated as capital and not
> revenue. This Court too had the occasion to deal with the issues in CIT v.
> Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre Pvt. Ltd. (ITA 586/2013,
> decided on 30.01.2015) where the decision in Ponni Sugars (supra) and
> previous authorities were discussed and applied in given facts of the case.
> We are of the opinion that the impugned order of the IT AT does not disclose
> any infirmity. No substantial question of law arises.
> It is accordingly dismissed. "
A reference was also made by the Ld. AR regarding CBDT Circular No.142 dated
1st August, 1974 in the context of subsidy received under the Central  78 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 Outright Grant of Subsidy Scheme. The Ld. AR relied upon the
decision of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of CIT vs. Sham Lai
Bansal in ITA: 472 of 2010, wherein the High Court, following the decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of Ponni Sugar (supra), held that the subsidy
received by the assessee was capital receipt not liable to tax. The following
decisions are also to the same effect:

467/Del/2014 The Ld. AR submitted that the nature of the subsidy - whether
capital or revenue, has to be examined by applying the "purpose test" as laid
down repeatedly by the Supreme Court in the case of Sahney Steel (supra) and
reiterated in Ponni Sugar (supra). There is also no dispute that the form and
nomenclature of the subsidy are totally irrelevant in order to determine the
nature of the subsidy. It would thus be appreciated that the purpose of grant
of subsidy/ incentive is the only relevant and crucial test for determining
the nature of the subsidy. If the incentive/ subsidy is given for promoting
industrialization and for employment generation, then all other factors like
the manner of giving the incentive (whether it be linked to purchase of a
capital asset like machinery, etc., or to purchase of a circulating asset like
raw material, etc.), the time of giving the incentive (whether prior to start
of operations or after that date) and the source of the subsidy (whether
received from customers as part of sale price) are totally irrelevant. In view
of the aforesaid, it is submitted that the aforesaid incentive/ subsidy was in
the nature of capital receipt not chargeable to tax in the hands of the
assessee. It may also be pointed out that a prospective amendment by insertion
of clause (xviii) to section 2(24) of the Act is made by Finance Act, 2015
applicable w.e.f. 01.04.2016 bringing to tax the subsidy (ies) received by the
assessee (except for reimbursement of actual cost). It is submitted that as
the amendment is made prospective, the subsidies, considering the purpose
test, shall be treated as capital receipts for earlier years including year
under consideration. The Ld. AR mentioned that the aforesaid issue was decided
in favour of the assessee by the order of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the assessment year(s) 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06,
2006-07 and 2007-08. Subsequently, the Tribunal had, for the assessment year
2008-09, relying upon the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of
Bhushan Steels and Strips Ltd., decided the aforesaid issue against the
assessee. The adverse decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of Bhushan
Steels and Strips Ltd. has been stayed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order
dated 20.11.2017 in SLP (C) No.30728-30732/2017. Further, the order of the
Tribunal for AY 2005-
80 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
06 has recently been affirmed by the Delhi High Court vide order dated
7.12.2017 in ITA No.171/2012, wherein the High Court has, relying upon the
decision in the case of Johnson Matthey (supra) held that sales tax exemption
received under the Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975 is to be treated as
capital receipt. Similarly, order of the Tribunal for assessment year 2006-07
has also been affirmed by the Delhi High Court in ITA No.381/2016. Therefore,
the Ld. AR submitted that the assessing officer erred in not excluding the
amount of subsidy while computing the taxable income of the assessee. Such
action is contrary to the facts of the case and position in law and the same,
therefore, calls for being reversed.
53\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
54\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant records. The
Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09 held as under:
"11. Grounds No 11 to 11.5 relate to the Sales Tax Subsidy claimed as capital
receipt from the total income. Briefly stated relevant facts on this ground,
as apparent from record and the Industrial Policy, 1999 notified on 11.11.1999
by the State Government of Haryana having a bearing on the claim of the
assessee, are that the assessee had, for the relevant year under
consideration, received sales tax concessions amounting toRs.13,55,68,826/-
from the Government of Haryana under Rule 28C of the Haryana General Sales Tax
Rules, 1975, and claimed it to be a capital receipt not liable for tax.
However, AO denied the same and brought it to tax by treating the same as
revenue receipt.
11.1. It is submitted on behalf of the assessee that the incentive/ subsidy
was granted to the assessee for undertaking substantial expansion of existing
industryin line with the larger public objective of the Policy to promote
industrialization and employment generation and  81 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 not
to supplement trading receipts, which is, it is respectfully submitted,
clearly in the nature of a capital receipt, not liable to tax. Ld. AR submits
that the issue regarding taxability of sales tax incentive is squarely covered
in favour of the assessee by the decisions reported in CIT vs Ponni Sugars and
Chemicals Ltd: 306 ITR 392 (SC), Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd. v. CIT: 228
ITR 253 (SC), V.S. S.V. Meenakshi Achi: 60 ITR 253 (SC), CIT v. Johnson

11.2. He drew support from the decision of the jurisdictional High Court in
the case of CIT v. Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre (P.) Ltd.: 373
ITR 14. Ld. AR further submitted that a coordinate Bench of Delhi Bench of the
Tribunal considered all relevant facts and decided  82 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
the issue in favour of the assessee in assessee's own cases in ITA
No.1927/Del/2010 (AY 2005-06), ITA No.5120/Del/2010 (AY 2006-07), ITA
No.5720/Del/2011 (AY 2007-08) and the decision in ITA No.1927/Del/2010 for
assessment year 2005-06 was followed by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of Johnson Matthey India (P) Ltd.v. Addl. CIT in ITA No.952/Del/2011,
wherein the Tribunal, in the context of the aforesaid sales tax incentive in
the State of Haryana, held the incentive to be capital receipt, not liable to
tax, most importantly the Hon'ble Delhi High Court affirmed the said decision
in the case titled as CIT vs. Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No.
193/2015.
11.3. Basing on this set of facts and law, Ld. AR submitted that the issue of
taxability of Sales Tax Subsidy pursuant to the Haryana Government's Scheme is
squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the aforesaid binding decision
of the jurisdictional Delhi High Court in the case of Johnson Matthey (supra).
11.4. Per contra, Ld. DR placed reliance on the decision of the Delhi High
Court in the case of CIT vs Bhushan Steel and Stripes Ltd., dt. 13.7.2017, ITA
No. 315/03,316/03,317/03,349/03 and 434/05 and submitted that in this decision
after considering all the decisions specially Sahney Steel and Ponni Sugars
and Chemicals Ltd. of Hon'ble Supreme Court, it was concluded by the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court that the Sales Tax subsidy received by the assessee as
revenue receipt. The Industrial Policy and Sales Tax subsidy policy have
discussed in detail for consideration of such receipts in the hands of the
assessee "whereas the State Government is of the opinion that for promoting of
certain industries and expansion of diversification or modernization existing
units (Page No. 15 of the above said order of the Hon'b!e Delhi  83 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 High Court). Page No. 23 of the above said order also mentions
that "the object of providing subsidy by way of permission to not deposit
amounts collected (as sales tax liability) - which meant that the customer or
servicer user concerned had to pay sales tax, but at the same time, the
collector (i.e the assessee) could retain the amount so collected, undoubtedly
was to achieve the larger goal of industrialization. This has been the basis
of sales tax subsidy received during the year. In principle there has not been
any difference in Haryana sales tax subsidy policy and UP sales tax policy.
The Ltd. AR of the assessee has been gas lighting the issues of sales tax
subsidy simply bifurcating it in the name of the States. The different forms
cannot be taken away the substance from the issues of sales tax subsidy.
According to him, the jurisprudence keeps involving, and accordingly, the
Delhi High Court has decided the issues of sales tax subsidy as revenue
receipts in the case of Bhushan Steel and Stripes Ltd. stating very clearly at
page No. 26 of its judgment.
11.5. According to the Ld. DR the assessee's case also encircles the issues of
sales tax subsidy in the similar ways, thereby, the sales tax subsidy received
in the hands of the assessee needs to be treated as revenue receipts, and the
Assessee's reliance on Bougainvillea multiplex Entertainment Centre Pvt. Ltd.
373 ITR 14(Del) and Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd., ITANo. 192/2015(Del) are
misplaced. Ld. DR emphasizes that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court's decision in
the case of M/s Bhushan Steel and Stripes Ltd. dt. 13.7.2017 being the recent
decision after consideration of all the case laws, wherein the wisdom of the
Delhi High Court has reached, in the processes of advancement of
jurisprudence, as to treat the sales tax subsidy as revenue receipt, has to be
preferred to other earlier decisions. This is being recent, speaking  84 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 and the well reasoned order needs to be followed by the
Hon'ble Bench, ITAT which falls under the jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court.
11.6. On this premise, Ld. DR, therefore, prayed to consider the recent
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court reached in the case of Bhushan Steel
& Stripes Ltd. for considering the sales tax subsidy as the revenue receipt
without considering the decision as per incuriam which is a subject matter of
Hon'ble supreme Court.
11.7. In reply, Ld. AR submitted that in the case of the Bhushan Steel &
Strips Limited the Hon'ble Delhi High Court considered the case of sales-tax
subsidy received under an altogether different industrial policy of the
Government of UP, and in that different context of the policy of the
Government of UP, the Court held that the sales tax subsidy was in the nature
of a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt.
11.8. Ld. AR referred to the paragraph No 25 and 26 of the decision in Bhushan
Steel & Strips Limited (supra) in support of his submission that this decision
of the Delhi High Court in the case of Bhushan Steel (supra) is confined to
the peculiar facts of the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Policy, 1990, as would be
evident from the following observations:
"25............Paras 6 (A) and 6(B) of that scheme specifically provided for
capital subsidy to set up prestige units; the amounts indicated (Rupees
fifteen lakhs) were to be towards capital expenditure. Now, if that was the
scheme under which the assessees set-up their units, undoubtedly it contained
specific provisions that enabled capital subsidies. Whether the assessees were
entitled to it, or not, is not relevant. The assessees are now concerned with
the sales tax amounts they were permitted to retain, under the amended scheme
(dated 27.07.1991) which allowed the facility of such retention, after the
unit (established and which could possibly claim benefit under the first
scheme) was already set up. This subsidy scheme had no strings attached. It
merely stated that the collection could be retained to the extent of 100% of
capital expenditure. Whilst it might be tempting to read the linkage with
capital expenditure as not only applying to the limit, but also implying an
underlying intention that the capital expenditure would thereby  85 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 be recouped, the absence of any such condition should restrain
the court from so concluding".
"26. How a state frames its policy to achieve its objectives and attain larger
developmental goals depends upon the experience, vision and genius of its
representatives. Therefore, to say that the indication of the limit of subsidy
as the capital expended, means that it replenished the capital expenditure and
therefore, the subsidy is capital, would not be justified. The specific
provision for capital subsidy in the main scheme and the lack of such a
subsidy in the supplementary scheme (of 1991) meant that the recipient, i.e.
the assessee had the flexibility of using it for any purpose. Unlike in Ponni
Sugars (supra), the absence of any condition towards capital utilization meant
that the policy makers envisioned greater profitability as an incentive for
investors to expand units, for rapid industrialization of the state, ensuring
greater employment. Clearly, the subsidy was revenue in nature."
11.9. Basing on the above observations, he submitted that the Hon'ble Court
gave much emphasis to the fact that the UP Industrial Policy specifically
provided for capital subsidies, and considering the fact that the in that case
assessee was not granted capital subsidy, as specifically contained in the
said Policy, the Court concluded that the subsidy received was not in the
nature of a capital subsidy but only a revenue subsidy; whereas, according to
the Ld. AR, unlike in the UP Industrial Policy, there is no specific provision
in the Haryana Industrial Policy for capital subsidy and hence, the decision
in the case of Bhushan is not applicable. As regards observations of the
Hon'ble Court regarding no strings being attached to the incentives, Ld. AR
submitted that such observations have to be read in the aforesaid context/
discussion wherein the Court held that the case of Bhushan was not falling in
capital subsidy scheme as contained in the UP Policy.
11.10. Ld. AR pointed out that in fact, in Johnson Matthey (supra) and
Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre (P) Limited: 373 ITR 14 the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that despite no strings being attached  86 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 thereto, the subsidy or incentive, as the case may be, was in
the nature of capital subsidy. He submitted that in similar view has been
taken in Shree Balaj Alloys : 198 Taxman 122 (J&K) - affirmed by SC in 287 CTR
459, CIT v. Chaphalkar Brothers: 351 ITR 309 (Bom) , CIT v. Rasoi Limited :
335 ITR 438 (Cal) , CIT v. Birla VXL Ltd: 215 Taxman 117 (Guj) , DCIT v Inox
Leisure Ltd. : 351 ITR 314 (Guj) , CIT v.Samta Chavigarh: 268 CTR 199 (Raj.).
11.11. Ld. AR emphatically submitted that the issue of taxability of sales tax
subsidy pursuant to the Haryana Government's Scheme is squarely covered in
favour of the assessee by the binding decision of the jurisdictional Delhi
High Court in the case of Johnson Matthey (supra), whereas the decision in the
case of Bhushan Steel (supra) rendered in the context of an altogether
different industrial policy of the Government of UP, as such, it is not
applicable to the facts of the present case.
11.12. According to the Ld. AR there is no conflict between the Judgements of
the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court in the cases of Johnson Matthey (supra)
and Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre (P) Limited: 373 ITR 14 on
one hand and Bhushan Steel (supra) on the other, inasmuch they dealt with two
different industrial policies surrounded by different facts and circumstances.
However, according to him, even if it is construed that there is a conflict
between two judgements of the Division Bench of the jurisdictional High Court,
then it has to be seen that the decision of the jurisdictional High Court in
the case of Johnson Matthey (supra) having been rendered in the context of the
very same scheme, Haryana Industrial Policy, 1999 in the context of which the
case of assessee falls, has to be preferred over the decision  87 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 of the jurisdictional High Court in the case of Bhushan Steels
(supra), because it has been rendered in context of an altogether different
Industrial Policy.
11.13. Placing reliance on the decisions rendered in Government of Andhra
Pradesh and Anr. vs. B. Satya Naraina Rao(dead) by LRs. and Others (2000) : 4
SCC 262(SC), A.R. Antuleyvs. R.S.Naik: AIR 1988 SC 1531 (SC), R. Thiruvirkolam
v. Presiding Officer and Another : 1 SCC 9 (SC), State of Assam v. RipaSarma :
3 SCC 63 (SC), Punjab Development and Reclamation Corporation Limited vs.
Presiding Officer, Labour Court : 1990 : 3SCC 682 (SC), CIT v. Thana
Electricity Supply Ltd.: 206 ITR 727 (Bom.), CIT v. Cascade Holdings (P) Ltd.:
365 ITR 84 (Bom.), Ld. AR submitted that even if there is a conflict between
the judgements of jurisdictional High Court, viz., Bougainvillea Multiplex
Entertainment Centre (supra) and Johnson Matthey (supra) on the one hand, and
Bhushan Steels (supra) on the other, the judgment rendered in case of Johnson
Matthey (supra) has to be preferred because the decision in the case of
Bhushan Steel (supra) was rendered without considering the earlier decisions
rendered by the bench of co-equal strength in case of Johnson Matthey (supra)
and Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre (P.) Ltd. (supra). Saying so,
he submitted that the contention of the Ld. DR that in the processes of
advancement of jurisprudence, the Hon'ble High Court has evolved the law to
treat the sales tax subsidy as revenue receipt cannot be accepted.
11.14. Lastly, Ld. AR contended that in Sandeep Kumar Bafna v. State of
Maharashtra and Anr. : AIR (2014) SC 1745; and Mamaleshwar Prasad v.
Kanhaiyalal (Dead) through L.Rs. : AIR (1975) SC 907 it has  88 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 been held that where two judicial precedents of co-equal strength
are available on the issue and the later judgment does not consider the
earlier one, then, the lower court shall follow the judicial precedent
rendered earlier in point of time.
11.15. We have carefully gone through the rival contentions in the light of
the decisions of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in CIT v. Bougainvillea
Multiplex Entertainment Centre (P.) Ltd.: 373 ITR 14 and CIT vs Bhushan Steel
and Stripes Ltd., and the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of Johnson Matthey India (P) Ltd.v. Addl. CIT in ITA No.952/Del/2011, and
upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case titled as CIT vs. Johnson
Matthey India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No. 193/2015. In all these cases the guidance
is taken and strength is derived from the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd. v. CIT: 228 ITR 253 (SC), and CIT vs
Ponni Sugars and Chemicals Ltd: 306 ITR 392 (SC). Purposive test is the key
principle that is applied for determination of the nature of the subsidy.
Though it is an undisputed fact that a coordinate Bench of this Tribunal
considered all relevant facts and decided the issue in favour of the assessee
in assessee's own cases in ITA No.1927/Del/2010 (AY 2005-06), ITA
No.5120/Del/2010 (AY 2006-07), ITA No.5720/Del/2011 (AY 2007-08), submission
of the DR that the law is kept on evolving by the Hon'ble jurisdictional High
Court, inasmuch as the Hon'ble Court in a subsequent and latest judgement in
Bhushan Steels case (supra) held that the subsidy given at post project stage
without mandating for any specific use of such subsidy fund, is only a revenue
receipt, necessitates this Bench to look afresh at the issue in the light of
the march of law. For proper appreciation of the  89 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
contentions of the parties, it is but necessary to find out the principles of
law laid down in these decisions.
11.16. In Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd ( supra) facts involve the
notification issued by the Andhra Pradesh Government where under certain
facilities and incentives were to be given to all the new industrial
undertakings which commenced production on or after 1st Jan., 1969 with
investment capital (excluding working capital) not exceeding Rs. 5 crores. The
incentives were to be allowed for a period of five years from the date of
commencement of production. Concession is also available for subsequent
expansion of 50 per cent and above of existing capacities provided in each
case, the expansion was located in a city or town or panchayat area other than
that in which the existing unit is located. The incentives were, refund of
sales-tax on raw materials, machinery and finished goods, levied by the State
Government subject to a maximum of 10 per cent of the equity capital paid up
in the case of public limited companies and the actual capital in the case of
others; subsidy on power consumed for production to the extent of 10 per cent
in the case of medium and large scale industries etc; exemption from payment
of water rate Liability on account of assessment of land revenue or taxes on
land used for establishment of any industry, shall be limited to the amount of
such taxes payable immediately before the land is so used.
11.17. In Sahney Steel's case, it was contended on behalf of the assessee that
the subsidy given was up to 10 per cent of the capital investment calculated
on the basis of the quantum of investment in capital, and, therefore, receipt
of such subsidy was on capital account and not on revenue account. It was also
urged in that case that subsidy  90 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 granted on the basis
of refund of sales tax on raw materials, machinery and finished goods were
also of capital nature as the object of granting refund of sales tax was that
the assessee could set up new business or expand his existing business.
However, Hon'ble Apex Court on examination of the decisions in the case of
Seaham Harbour Dock Co. vs. Crook 16 Tax Cases 333 (HL), Lincolnshire Sugar
Co. Ltd. vs. Smart 20 Tax Cases 643 and a Canadian case St. John Dry Dock &
Ship Building Co. Ltd. vs. Minister of National Revenue 4 DLR 1, and while
affirming the principle laid down in Ostime vs. Pontypridd & Rhondda Joint
Water Board 28 Tax Cases 262, held that the contention that the subsidies were
of capital nature and were given for the purpose of stimulating setting up and
expansion of industries in the State cannot be upheld because of the subsidy
scheme itself. Hon'ble Court observed that no financial assistance was granted
to the assessee for setting up of the industry, and it was only when the
assessee had set up its industry and commenced production, various incentives
were given for the limited period of five years. The Hon'ble Court further
observed that that the endeavour of the State was to provide the newly set up
industries a helping hand for 5 years to enable them to be viable and
competitive, sales-tax refund and the relief on account of water rate, land
revenue as well as electricity charges were all intended to enable the
assessee to run the business more profitably, as such the amount paid to the
assessee was in the nature of subsidy from public funds to assist it in
carrying on its trade or business. Having regard to the scheme of the
Notification, it was held that there can be little doubt that the object of
various assistances under the subsidy scheme was to enable the assessee to run
the business more profitably, since the payments were made only after the
industries have been set up.
91 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Payments are not being made for the purpose of setting up of the industries.
But the package of incentives was given to the industries to run more
profitably for a period of five years from the date of the commencement of
production. In other words, a helping hand was being provided to the
industries during the early days to enable them to come to a competitive level
with other established industries. In such circumstances, the Hon'ble Court
held that the payments were nothing but supplementary trade receipts, though
the assessee could not use this money for distribution as dividend to its
shareholders, but, the assessee was free to use the money in its business
entirely as it liked and was not obliged to spend the money for a particular
purpose, as such, by no stretch of imagination can the subsidies whether by
way of refund of sales-tax or relief of electricity charges or water charges
can be treated as an aid to setting up of the industry of the assessee. If any
subsidy is given, the character of the subsidy in the hands of the recipient--
whether revenue or capital--will have to be determined by having regard to the
purpose for which the subsidy is given. If it is given by way of assistance to
the assessee in carrying on of his trade or business, it has to be treated as
trading receipt. The sales-tax upon collection forms part of the public funds
of the State. In this sense it was held that the source of the fund is quite
immaterial. If the purpose is to help the assessee to set up its business or
complete a project, the monies must be treated as to have been received for
capital purpose. But, if monies are given to the assessee for assisting him in
carrying out the business operation and the money is given only after and
conditional upon commencement of production, such subsidies must be treated as
assistance for the purpose of the trade. In Sahney's case, subsidies have not
been granted for production of or bringing into  92 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
existence any new asset, but were granted year after year only after setting
up of the new industry and commencement of production and such a subsidy could
only be treated as assistance given for the purpose of carrying on of the
business of the assessee. These subsidies are of revenue character and will
have to be taxed accordingly. Hon'ble Apex Court also noted many decisions of
Indian Courts on this aspect, viz., V.S.S.V. Meenakshi Achi & Anr. vs. CIT
(1966) 60 ITR 253 (SC), CIT vs. Ruby Rubber Works Ltd. (1989) 78 CTR (Ker) 75,
Sadichha Chitra vs. CIT (1990) 90 CTR (Bom) 135, Kesoram Industries & Cotton
Mills Ltd. vs. CIT (1991) 191 ITR 518 (Cal), CIT vs. Dusad Industries (1986)
51 CTR (MP) 217 etc. 11.18. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the
Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of CIT vs. Dusad Industries (1986) 51
CTR (MP) 217 : (1986) 162 ITR 784 (MP) : TC 13R.622, dealt with a case where
Government had framed a scheme for granting sales-tax subsidies to industries
set up in backward areas took the view that the object of the scheme was not
to supplement the profits made by industries. In that view of the matter, the
High Court held that the subsidies given under the said scheme by the
Government to newly set up industries were capital receipts in the hands of
the industries and could not be taxed as revenue receipts. In that case, 75
per cent of the sales-tax paid in a year for a period of five years from the
day of starting of production was to be given back by the Government to the
industry concerned. The High Court was of the view that obviously the subsidy
was given by way of an incentive for capital investment and not by way of
addition to the profits of the assessee as was clear from the facts and
circumstances of the case. While referring to these facts, Hon'ble Apex Court
held that the Madhya Pradesh High Court, however, failed to  93 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 notice the significant fact that under the scheme framed by the
Government, no subsidy was given until the time production was actually
commenced, mere setting up of the industry did not qualify an industrialist
for getting any subsidy, and the subsidy was given as help not for the setting
up of the industry which was already there but as an assistance after the
industry commenced production. Hon'ble Apex Court, therefore, held that the
view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court is erroneous.
11.19. Law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sahney Steel and Press Works
Ltd ( supra) is, therefore, that the character of the subsidy in the hands of
the recipient--whether revenue or capital--will have to be determined by
having regard to the purpose for which the subsidy is given. If the purpose is
to help the assessee to set up its business or complete a project, the monies
must be treated as to have been received for capital purpose, and if it is
given by way of assistance to the assessee in carrying on of his trade or
business, it has to be treated as trading receipt. The source of the fund is
quite immaterial. In a case where 75 per cent of the sales-tax paid in a year
for a period of five years from the day of starting of production was to be
given back by the Government to the industry concerned, the view taken by the
Madhya Pradesh High Court that the subsidy was given by way of an incentive
for capital investment and not by way of addition to the profits of the
assessee was expressly disapproved basing on the significant fact that under
the scheme framed by the Government, no subsidy was given until the time
production was actually commenced.
11.20. In Ponni Sugars case (supra), four factors exist in the Incentive
Schemes, were, (i) benefit of the incentive subsidy was available only to  94
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 new units and to substantially expanded units, not to
supplement the trade receipts; (ii) the minimum investment specified was Rs. 4
crores for new units and Rs. 2 crores for expansion units; (iii) increase in
the free sale sugar quota depended upon increase in the production capacity.
In other words, the extent of the increase of free sale sugar quota depended
upon the increase in the production capacity; (iv) the benefit of the Scheme
had to be utilized only for repayment of term loans. The important point noted
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in this case is that Government of India, financial
institutions as well as the sugar industries are parties to the Scheme in the
sense that but for the Scheme the financial institutions would not have given
term loans to set up new units/expansion of the existing units. Keeping in
mind the object behind the payment of the incentive subsidy such payment
received by the assessee under the Scheme was not in the course of a trade but
was of capital nature, while reiterating the principle of purposive test
enunciated in Sahney Steel & Press Works Ltd., Hon'ble Apex Court held, that
the receipt of the subsidy by the assessee in that case was capital in nature
as the assessee was obliged to utilize the subsidy only for repayment of term
loans undertaken by the assessee for setting up new units/expansion of
existing business.
11.21. In Bougainville case (supra), facts submitted to the Court are that
against the backdrop of steep decline of viewership due to various reasons
including onslaught of cable television leading to erosion in entertainment
tax collections and with a view to encourage setting up of multiplex cinema
halls and malls, in order to promote the viewership in cinema halls, various
State Governments, being aware that setting up an operation of such
multiplexes involves various problems including huge capital investments, had
come up with schemes offering incentives  95 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 to cinema
industry and the Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh formulated a
promotional scheme to such effect and notified it by Government order issued
on 13.07.1999. Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court after noticing the decisions
of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd. v. CIT: 228 ITR
253 (SC), and CIT vs Ponni Sugars and Chemicals Ltd: 306 ITR 392 (SC) found
vide Para No 32, that the UP Scheme under which the assessee claims exemption
to the extent of entertainment tax subsidy, claiming it to be capital receipt,
is clearly designed to promote the investors in the cinema industry
encouraging establishment of new multiplexes. Since the subsidy of such nature
cannot possibly be granted by the Government directly, the Entertainment tax
is leviable on the admission tickets to cinema halls only after the facility
becomes operational, and since the source of the subsidy is the public at
large which is to be attracted as viewers to the cinema halls, the funds to
support such an incentive cannot be generated until and unless the cinema
halls become functional, by applying the "purpose test", referred to in Ponni
Sugars (supra) held that the assistance in the form of entertainment tax
exemption came in the hands of assessee to enable it to set up the new unit
which renders it a receipt on capital account. The periodicity (year to year)
of the subsidy, its source (collections from the public at large) and the form
(deemed deposit) are irrelevant considerations.
11.22. In CIT vs. Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd., while referring to the
decisions in Sahney (supra), Ponni Sugars (supra) and Bougainvillea Multiplex
Entertainment Centre (supra), Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court observed as
under:
"This Court has considered the submissions and is of the opinion that the
ITAT's impugned order has noted the relevant law. Crucially, Ponni Sugars
(supra) is a  96 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 later decision of the Supreme Court
which had gone to deal with various authorities, including Sahney (supra). The
Supreme Court has emphasized in each case the purpose for which subsidy or
assistance is given by the State government or a public agency. If that is to
promote an industry, especially with special interest of development of
capital infrastructure, the amounts received are to be treated as capital and
not revenue. This Court too had the occasion to deal with the issues in CIT v.
Bougainvillea Multiplex Entertainment Centre Pvt. Ltd. (ITA 586/2013, decided
on 30.01.2015) where the decision in Ponni Sugars (supra) and previous
authorities were discussed and applied in given facts of the case.
We are of the opinion that the impugned order of the ITAT does not disclose
any infirmity. No substantial question of law arises.
It is accordingly dismissed."
11.23. Recently the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs Bhushan
Steel and Stripes Ltd., dt. 13.7.2017, ITA No. 315/03,316/03,317/03,349/03 and
434/05 after considering all the decisions specially Sahnev Steel and Ponni
Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. of Hon'ble Supreme Court, and Bougainville case
(supra) of High Court, reached a conclusion that the Sales Tax subsidy
received by the assessee as revenue receipt.
11.24. In this case, the Hon'ble Court observed that the object of providing
subsidy by way of permission to not deposit amounts collected (as sales tax
liability)- which meant that the customer or servicer user concerned had to
pay sales tax, but at the same time, the collector (i.e. the assessee) could
retain the amount so collected, undoubtedly was to achieve the larger goal of
industrialization, and the achievement of a quantitative limit (of 125% of
capital expenditure in the case of small scale units and 100% in the case of
other units) meant that the subsidy could no longer be claimed. However, it
was further observed that whilst it might be tempting to read the linkage with
capital expenditure as not only applying to the limit, but also implying  97
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 an underlying intention that the capital expenditure
would thereby be recouped, the absence of any such condition should restrain
the court from so concluding. In this matter, it was stated that in Sahney
Steel (supra) and Ponni Sugars (supra) the issue decided was - what was the
true purpose of the incentive or the subsidy, whereas the end use of the funds
was considered as an additional argument to decide the matter either way.
Furthermore, basing on the amendment to Section 2(24) of the Act by the
Finance Act, 2015, it was contended before the Hon'ble jurisdictional High
Court that, ........ the Finance Act of 2015 which came into force on
01.04.2016 amended Section 2(24) of the Income Tax Act and inserted Clause
(xvi). It is stated that assistance in the form of subsidy or grant or cash
incentive or duty drawback or waiver by Central or State Governments or any
authority in cash or kind to the assessee other than subsidy or grant or
reimbursement which is taken into account determining the actual cost of the
asset, is deemed to be income. It was submitted that this amendment clarifies
the intent of Parliament which is that the assistance received otherwise than
towards capital augmentation or creation is deemed to be income. This
amendment is prospective which means that the law is to be interpreted in the
light of the judgments applicable, notably Ponni Sugars (supra) in the present
case.
11.25. After considering the entire case law on this aspect, vide paragraph No
26, the Hon'ble court held,-
26\. How a state frames its policy to achieve its objectives and attain larger
developmental goals depends upon the experience, vision and genius of its
representatives. Therefore, to say that the indication of the limit of subsidy
as the capital expended, means that it replenished the capital expenditure and
therefore, the subsidy is capital, would not be justified. The specific
provision for capital subsidy in the main scheme and the lack of such a
subsidy in the supplementary scheme (of 1991) meant that the recipient, i.e.
the assessee had the flexibility of using it for any purpose. Unlike in Ponni
Sugars (supra), the absence of any condition towards capital utilization meant
that the policy makers envisioned greater profitability as an incentive for
investors to expand units, for rapid industrialization of the state, ensuring
greater employment. Clearly, the subsidy was revenue in nature.
98 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
11.26. A reading of all these decisions, therefore, makes the golden principle
that runs through them very clear. While framing its policy to achieve its
objectives and attain larger developmental goals, depending upon the
experience, vision and genius of its representatives, it is always open for
the State to provide incentives, which results in capital and revenue receipts
in the hands of the receiver, depending upon the purpose for which they are
given. If any subsidy is given, the character of the subsidy in the hands of
the recipient--whether revenue or capital--will have to be determined by
having regard to the purpose for which the subsidy is given. If the purpose is
to help the assessee to set up its business or complete a project, the monies
must be treated as to have been received for capital purpose. But, if monies
are given to the assessee for assisting him in carrying out the business
operation and the money is given only after and conditional upon commencement
of production, such subsidies must be treated as assistance for the purpose of
the However, any stipulation placing the assessee is under obligation to
utilize the subsidy only for repayment of term loans undertaken by the
assessee for setting up new units/expansion of existing business, or to
liquidate the cost incurred in creating the capital asset, makes the receipt a
capital receipt and renders the time of providing the subsidy irrelevant. Mere
indication of the limit of subsidy as the capital expended does not justify
the conclusion that it replenished the capital expenditure and therefore, the
subsidy is capital. It is, therefore, neither the lofty ideals/objectives of
the policy document nor the presumed end use of the subsidy amount that
determines the nature or subsidy in the hands of the recipient, but the
purpose envisaged by the policy document that satisfies the 'purpose test'
formulated under Sahney's case. Unless the intention of the policy  99 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 makers is express and clear discernible from the policy document
to link up the utilization of subsidy amount, irrespective of the time of
recipient getting it, with liquidation of the capital cost, as could be gather
from the decisions of Sahney steels and Ponni Sugars cases, no inference is
permissible to be drawn that the subsidy results in capital receipt in the
hands of the recipient. Developmental objectives of the subsidy policy
document, ipso facto, do not determine the nature of subsidy. Purpose as could
be culled out from the framework of the policy document is the sole
determinative factor. Having noted the context of relevancy or otherwise of
the source, form and time of subsidy in determining its nature, now we shall
proceed to examine the nature of receipt in the hands of the assessee in this
matter.
11.27. Main objectives of the Haryana Industrial Policy are to increase the
share of industry in the Net/Gross State Domestic Product by attracting new
investments and growth of existing industry; to increase the employment in
Industrial and Allied sector by 20% in the next five years; to attain
sustainable economic development through catalysis of investments in all
sectors of the economy; to achieve larger value addition within the State
thereby contributing to a higher quality of life etc. According to the
assessee, a perusal of the aforesaid indicates that the objectives of the
Policy inter-alia, included growth of existing industry and increasing the
employment opportunities. For achieving the aforesaid objective, the stated
approach, inter alia, was to rationalize the package of incentives making it
more effective and meaningful for speedy development of the State. The Policy
specifically provided for customised package of incentives and concessions for
prestigious projects to be decided by a high power committee.
100 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
11.28 Policy document says, "SCHEME OF INCENTIVES CUSTOMISED PACKAGE OF
INCENTIVES Customised package of incentives and concessions will be provided
for prestigious projects having investment of Rs.30 crores and above. A High
Powered Committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of the Chief
Minister to decide the package in individual cases"
11.29. Accordingly, sales tax concessions were to be provided to new units and
also industrial units undergoing expansion/ diversification. Pursuant to the
aforesaid Policy, Chapter IV-C was inserted in July, 2000 in the Haryana
General Sales Tax Rules' 1975, containing Rule 28C dealing with "Tax
Concessions, Class of Industries, Period and Other Conditions". The Salient
features of the said Rule 28C, to the extent relevant, are as under:
(a) Concessions shall be available to an "eligible industrial unit";
(b) The expression "eligible industrial unit" was defined in sub-clause (c) of
Rule 28C(3) of Haryana General Sales Tax Rules'1975 to include a new
industrial unit or unit undertaking expansion or diversification subject to
fulfillment of other conditions. The relevant extract of the said definition
is as under: "Rule 28-C .........
(3)(c) "eligible industrial unit" means-
(1) a new industrial unit or a unit undertaking expansion or diversification
which, on the date of commercial production of new/expanded/diversified unit,
fulfills the following conditions......" (emphasis supplied)
(c) The term "expansion" was defined in clause (f) of Rule 28C(3) of Haryana
General Sales Tax Rules'1975 as under:
> "expansion" means an industrial capacity set up or installed during the
> operative period which creates additional production facilities for
> manufacture of the same product (s) as of the unit before expansion in which
> the additional fixed capital investment in plant and machinery made during
> the operating period in one go, not exceeding the period of one year,
> exceeds 25% of the fixed capital  101 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 investment (gross
> block) of the unit before expansion at the same or new location." (emphasis
> supplied)
> (d) Eligibility of prestigious units defined in clause (m) as unit having
> fixed capital investment exceeding Rs.30 crores, shall be determined by the
> High Powered Committee;
(e) Clause 5(b), provides that decision to grant tax concession to prestigious
unit shall be taken by the High Powered Committee on the basis of factors like
employment generation, likely revenue, growth of ancillaries, impact on
overall industrial growth, etc. [Also refer clause 6(e)].;
(f) Clause 8(a) provides for issuance of the entitlement certificate in form
ST-72B.
11.30. In terms of sub-rule (5)(b) of Rule 28C, it is provided that the
decision to grant tax concession to a prestigious unit is given on the basis
of factors like employment generation, impact on overall industrial growth,
etc. According to the Ld. AR assessee in this case falls in the category of
'prestigious unit'. He emphasized that the underlying objective of conferring
the benefit under Rule 28C, clearly proves beyond any doubt the fact that the
avowed intent/ purpose of granting the concession is industrial development of
the State and employment generation.
11.31. In this background, the assessee had undertaken industrial expansion in
terms of the Rule 28C of Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975. The High
Powered Committee, thereafter, in its meeting held on 14.06.2001 granted sales
tax concession to the assessee, whereby the assessee was required to pay 50%
of the sales tax collected on sales of finished products from expanded unit
and, retain balance 50% of the tax so collected, subject to maximum
permissible benefit of Rs.564.35 crores. The letter/ communication received
from Director of Industries, Haryana intimating the aforesaid decision,
clearly referred to concession being granted "only in respect of vehicles  102
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 rolled out of production capacity of 70,000 vehicles
added as a result of first expansion". Pursuant thereto, the assessee was
issued entitlement certificate dated 01.08.2001 under rule 28C of Haryana
General Sales Tax Rules, 1975 to avail sales tax concession to the extent of
Rs.564.35 crores during the period 01.08.2001 to 31.07.2015.
11.32. Ld. AR submitted that in the case of the Bhushan Steel & Strips Limited
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court considered the case of sales-tax subsidy received
under an altogether different industrial policy of the Government of UP, and
in that different context of the policy of the Government of UP, the Court
held that the sales tax subsidy was in the nature of a revenue receipt and not
a capital receipt.
11.33. A comparative analysis of the both the policies, namely, Uttar Pradesh
Industrial Policy, 1990 (applicable to the facts of Bhushan's case (supra))
and Haryana Industrial Policy, 1999 (applicable to the case of the appellant),
is tabulated by the Ld. AR as follows:

11.34. Basing on this he submitted that the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Policy,
1990 and the Haryana Industrial Policy,1999, are altogether different
Industrial Policies with altogether different eligibility criteria. He
submitted that the UP Industrial Policy specifically provided for "Capital
Subsidy Scheme", which is not there in the case of Haryana Policy.
11.35. However, on a careful perusal of the schemes in question, we find that,
but for certain changes in the form and expression, there is no material
difference between these schemes in substances. They are similar in respect of
the time, its source and the form of subsidy in the hands of the assessee.
Time of assessee getting subsidy as is adverted to in Sahney's case or the
stipulation of utilization of subsidy as is in Ponni's case are similar in
both the schemes. In the case on hand the fact remains that the concession is
granted only in respect of vehicles rolled out of production capacity of
70,000 vehicles added as a result of  105 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 first
expansion. Except making some specific provision for capital subsidy in the
main scheme and the lack of such a subsidy in the supplementary scheme (of
1991) in respect of the UP Scheme, under both the schemes there is no
difference. Under both the schemes no strings attached in respect of the
utilization of funds and the assessees have the flexibility of using it for
any purpose. There is no stipulation as to how the subsidy money has to be
utilized which means that the assessee had the flexibility of using it for any
purpose. Specific provision for capital subsidy in the main scheme and the
lack of such a subsidy in the supplementary scheme (of 1991) in respect of the
UP Scheme only corroborated the conclusion that the recipient of the subsidy,
i.e. the assessee had the flexibility of using it for any purpose. Per se, the
existence or otherwise of provisions for capital subsidy does make any
difference in the nature of subsidy funds in the hands of the assessee insofar
as they are allowed only after the completion of the formation of capital
asset and the absence of any condition towards capital utilization meant that
the policy makers envisioned greater profitability as an incentive for
investors to expand units, for rapid industrialization of the state, ensuring
greater employment which fact distinguishes the present case from the facts of
Ponni Sugar's case. When the purpose of the subsidy is clearly revenue in
nature, end use of the funds by the assessee to liquidate the cost incurred in
the expansion activity remains irrelevant having regard to the fact that the
subsidy was not expressly for meeting the capital expenses either in the
presenti or of past as was the case in Ponni Sugar's case. Though the case in
Bougainville was referred to in the case of Johnson Matthey, the Hon'ble Court
noticed the said case in Bougainville while rendering the decision in Bhushan
Steels case also. Though the findings of the  106 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Tribunal in Johnson Matthey's case were upheld by the Hon'ble Jurisdictional
High Court in CIT vs. Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd., we find it difficult to
agree with the argument of the Ld. AR that the observations of this Tribunal
made in assesee's case were approved by the Hon'ble High Court, inasmuch as
the Hon'ble Court has not specifically considered the same. As has been
consistently held in all the decisions from Sahney Steels to Bhushan steels
that insofar as the subsidy benefits inure to the benefit of the assessee
after the accomplishment of the expansion without any burden of any condition
towards capital utilization of the subsidy amount meant that the policy makers
envisioned greater profitability as an incentive for investors to expand
units, for rapid industrialization of the state, ensuring greater employment.
In this context, we find it difficult to agree with the submission of the Ld.
AR that the decision in CIT vs. Johnson Matthey India Pvt. Ltd., has to be
preferred to the latest decision of the Jurisdictional High Court in CIT vs
Bhushan Steel and Stripes Ltd. on the ground that the Haryana State scheme was
considered in the later, whereas in the later one UP Scheme was considered.
For that matter in both Bougainville's case and Bhushan Steels's case, the
very same UP scheme was considered, but with different result. No conflict
could be seen in the principle applied or laid down, but what we understand is
that the change in result is occasioned by the variance of facts.
11.36. For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs, we are of the
considered opinion that any subsidy given to the assessee post accomplishment
of the project or expansion there, without any obligation to utilize the
subsidy only for repayment of term loans undertaken by the assessee for
setting up new units/expansion of existing business, or to liquidate the cost
incurred in creating the capital  107 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 asset or its
expansion, is only in the nature of the revenue receipt and is liable to be
brought to tax. We, therefore, uphold the addition on this count and
accordingly dismiss the grounds 11 to 11.5."
Thus, the issue is squarely covered by the decision of the Tribunal in
Assessee's own case. Therefore, in absence of any contrary material brought to
our notice by the Ld. AR against the order of the Tribunal, we dismiss the
grounds. Ground No. 6 to 6.5 are dismissed.
55\. In result, Ground No. 6 to 6.5 are dismissed.
56\. Ground No. 7 to 7.3 is regarding disallowance of royalty paid. The Ld. AR
submitted that during the year under consideration, the assessee paid royalty
amounting to Rs.6,791,180,556/- to Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan ('SMC') for
use of licensed information for the engineering, design and development,
manufacture, testing, quality control, sale and after sales service of
products and parts. The said payment was claimed as revenue expenditure.
Though in the original return the assessee had claimed running royalty as
revenue expenditure and lump sum royalty as capital expenditure, the lump sum
royalty was claimed as a revenue expenditure through the revised return of
income. The assessing officer, in the impugned assessment order, has held that
royalty paid by the assessee was capital in nature and consequently, held that
the entire royalty is disallowable. Since, TPO had made adjustment of
Rs.311.74 crores, the assessing officer has computed the disallowance out of
royalty payments as under:
    Total Royalty                 Rs.679.11cr
    Less: Adjustment by TPO       -Rs.311.73cr
    Balance                       Rs.367.38cr
    Depreciation on above@25%     -Rs.91.84cr
    Disallowance                  Rs.275.54cr
                                               108                        ITA No. 467/Del/2014
In this regard, the Ld AR submitted that the aforesaid action of the Assessing
Officer in holding the royalty payments to be capital in nature. The aforesaid
right vested with the assessee was not exclusive in as much as in terms of
Article 2.01(b)(ii), SMC granted license for non-exclusive use outside India,
meaning thereby, that the owner of the trademark reserved with itself, the
right to allow the user of the very same trademark to any other nature is not
tenable in law due to the reason that the payment was under the agreement and
the same is allowable revenue expenditure. Expenditure is regarded as capital
in nature, if the same results in, (i) acquisition of capital asset (s); or
(ii) benefit of enduring nature in the capital field or adds to the profit
earning apparatus of the assessee. Having regard to the aforesaid settled
legal principles, the Ld. AR submitted that in the present case since the
payment of royalty by the assessee under the aforesaid agreement does not
result in acquisition of any new assets or benefit of enduring nature in the
capital field, the same cannot be regarded as in the nature of capital
expenditure. The Ld. AR submitted that on perusal of the agreement dated
04.01.2005 entered into between the assessee and SMC, it is patently clear
that payment of royalty by the assessee does not result in acquisition of any
new assets or benefit of enduring nature in the capital field, and therefore,
the same cannot be regarded as capital expenditure. To further elaborate, the
Ld. AR submitted that there is no ownership rights given to the assessee. The
Ld. AR submitted that during the currency of the agreement, the assessee only
had a limited right to use the technology provided by SMC. In terms of
Articles 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04, the ownership/proprietary rights in the
technical know-how, at all times, continued and still continues to vest in SMC
and the assessee was not authorized to transfer, assign or convey the
licensed/know-how/technical information to any third party and, therefore, the
assessee only acquired limited right to use and exploit the know-how, for
carrying on manufacturing/ business operations. Further, the conditions in the
agreement stipulated in Article 3.10 as to non-partibility, confidentiality
and the secrecy of the know- how also indicate that the assessee obtained mere
right to use the know-how  109 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 during the currency of the
agreement, without anything more. Even improvements to the technical
knowledge/ information belong to the owner, i.e. SMC. The Courts, including
the Apex Court and the jurisdictional High Court have, in the following cases,
consistently held that payment made for obtaining access to information and
restricted license to the limited use of know-how, should be treated as
revenue expenditure. The Ld. AR relied upon the following decisions:
• CIT v. Ciba India Ltd: 69 ITR 692 (SC) • Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. v.
CIT: 177 ITR 377 (SC) • CIT v. Shriram Pistons and Rings Limited -CC

Trib.)  110 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 The Ld. AR further pointed out the decision
of the Delhi High Court in the case of CIT v. Hero Honda Motors Ltd.: 372 ITR
481, wherein the High Court while following the aforesaid decisions has held
that royalty payment made to a foreign company for merely acquiring right to
use technical knowhow whereas ownership and intellectual property rights in
know how remained with foreign company, was allowable revenue expenditure. In
the aforesaid judgments, the Courts/ Tribunal have, on an analysis of the
agreement, come to the conclusion that payment made under the agreement was
deductible revenue expenditure, since there was no out and out/ absolute
transfer of the know- how by the owner-licensor to the licensee and the know-
how supplied by the foreign company remained the property of the foreign
company for all times to come; the assessee having only a limited right to use
the know-how during the currency of the agreement. The no exclusive use of
Trademark, the aforesaid right vested with the assessee was not exclusive in
as much as in terms of Article 2.01(b)(ii), SMC granted license for non-
exclusive use outside India, meaning thereby, that the owner of the trademark
reserved with itself, the right to allow the user of the very same trademark
to any other person. The Ld. AR submitted that in terms of Article 2.01
(b)(i), the exclusive license granted to the assessee within India by SMC only
ensures that SMC would not grant similar license(s) to any other person in the
same territory for manufacture of the specified products. Such an exclusive
license only eliminates competition thereby securing profitability of the
assessee. The same does not result in acquisition of any new asset or any
enduring advantage in the capital field. The exclusive license only enables
the business of the assessee to be carried on more efficiently and profitably,
while leaving the fixed capital untouched. In the following cases,
notwithstanding that the licensee in India had access to the know-how of the
foreign company under an exclusive license, the payment in the nature of
royalty made has been held to be revenue in nature. The Ld. AR relied upon the
following decisions:
• CIT v. Ciba India Ltd: 69 ITR 692 (SC)  111 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 • CIT v.
IAEC (Pumps) Ltd.: 232 ITR 316 (SC) • Shriram Refrigeration Industries Ltd. v.

• Shivani Locks Ltd. (ITA No. 3173 & 3048/D/07) (Del)(ITAT) • Hero Honda (P)
Ltd.: ITA No 5130/Del/2010 (Del. ITAT) The Ld. AR further submitted that there
is no enduring benefit in capital field. The assessee only had the right to
use the Trademark on non-exclusive basis. In terms of Article 7.04 and 7.05,
the assessee is always exposed to the risk of premature termination of the
agreement by the licensor. On termination of the agreement, the assessee
carries the risk of not getting the upgraded technology from owner, i.e. SMC
in the present case. The mere fact that the agreement with the licensor did
not specifically debar the assessee from using the knowledge after the
termination of the agreement does not, the Ld. AR submitted, mean that the
assessee acquired any advantage of capital in nature so as to be treated as
capital expenditure, considering the rapid stride in technological advancement
and the fast technological obsolescence. The advantage of the continued
utilization of the special knowledge and technical know-how along with the
specific drawings, business and other information, in light of the quick
changing technology does not result in any enduring advantage in the capital
field, apart from the submission made earlier that the assessee was a mere
licensee, entitled to use the technical knowhow of SMC. The Ld. AR relied upon
the following judicial pronouncements wherein it has been held that the
assessee's right to make use of the technical know-how and the knowledge even
after the period of the agreement is of no consequence:
112 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
• CIT v. Avery India Ltd : 207 ITR 813 (Cal) • Praga Tools Ltd v. CIT : 123
ITR 773 (FB)(AP) • CIT v. Tata Engineering Ltd: 123 ITR 538 (Bom) • Triveni

• CIT v. Gujarat Carbon Ltd.: 254 ITR 294 (Guj.) • CIT v. Kanpur Cigarettes
(P) Ltd.: 287 ITR 485 (All.) The Ld. AR further submitted that the mode of
payment is irrelevant. Under the agreement, in consideration of use of know-
how for manufacturing the vehicles/parts, the assessee is obliged to make
payment by way of (a) lumpsum royalty; and (b) running royalty. The Ld. AR
submitted that the aforesaid payment of lump sum royalty is made under the
same agreement and is governed by the same terms. The objective of incurrence
of both the expenses is the same and is subject to the same terms and
obligations. In terms of Article 6.01 and 6.02, royalty is paid in lumpsum in
three installments starting from the year of entering into the license
agreement while running royalty is paid each year on the basis of quantum of
sale of each model. The Ld. AR submitted that the payment of running royalty
is directly linked and correlated with the production/ sales of cars and
spares by the assessee company. If there is no production/ sale of cars and
spares, there will be no royalty payable by the assessee to SMC. The assessee
merely gets a license to use the various items of the intellectual property of
the licensor for manufacture of the licensed products and parts without
acquiring any ownership of such intellectual property. Such license to
manufacture has been granted by the licensor to the assessee during the
validity of the license agreement. The royalty is paid by the assessee on the
number of licensed products already manufactured and there is no future
benefit to be derived from such payment. Accordingly, there is no  113 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 enduring benefit of capital nature to the assessee and the
expenditure is revenue in nature. It has been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. 177 ITR 377 and also in
Empire Jute case 124 ITR 1 (SC) that the tests of "enduring benefit" and
"lumpsum payment" or "once for all payments" are immaterial and irrelevant for
laying down whether a particular item of expenditure is capital or revenue.
The Ld. AR referred the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of
Shriram Refrigeration Industries Ltd. v. CIT: 127 ITR 746. The assessee, in
that case, in consideration of the rights granted for use of know-how agreed
to pay lump-sum fee and recurring royalty. The revenue allowed deduction for
the recurring royalty paid but held payment of lump-sum fee to be capital in
nature. The High Court, on an analysis of the agreement, came to the
conclusion that the payment of lump- sum fee not being for acquisition of any
ownership rights in the know-how was allowable revenue expenditure. The Court
further noted that the Revenue having allowed deduction for the recurring
royalty paid, the lump-sum fee could not, even otherwise, be treated
differently. The Ld. AR also made reference to the decision of the Delhi High
Court in case of CIT v. Hero Honda Motors Ltd.: 372 ITR 481 wherein, the High
Court held royalty to be in the nature of revenue expenditure even though
royalty was paid for exclusive use of technical knowhow/ information, the
agreement was for 10 years and extendable and the assessee was permitted to
use the technical knowhow and information even after termination of the
agreement. To the same effect is the decisions of the Delhi Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of Hero Honda Motors Ltd. vs. DCIT: ITA No. 5130/Del/2010
for Assessment Year 2006-07. In view of the above cumulative reasons, where
the expenditure incurred by way of royalty merely facilitates carrying on of
business more profitably and efficiently, without addition to the capital
apparatus, the advantage of enduring nature ensuing there from shall be on
revenue account only. The Ld. AR relied upon Circular No. 21 of 1969 issued by
CBDT, which clarifies that if in terms of the Agreement, only a license is
obtained for user of technical knowledge from a foreign participant for a
limited period together with or without the right to use  114 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 the patents and trademarks of the foreign party, the payment
would not bring into existence an asset of enduring advantage to the Indian
party. Following the aforesaid Circular, similar royalty payment was held to
be allowable as revenue deduction by the jurisdictional Delhi High Court in
case of CIT v Lumax Industries Limited: 173 Taxman 390. It has similarly been
held in the case of CIT V. J.K. Synthetics Limited: 309 ITR 371 (Del). The
assessing officer, in the impugned order, has disallowed the royalty as
capital expenditure following the assessment orders for the preceding
assessment years on the following grounds:
• Car is a fast moving consumer product with a life cycle of 5 years whereas
the license agreement is for 10 years, extendable by 5 years, and even
thereafter the assessee can produce the said model of car, which provides more
than enduing benefit to the assessee.
• The license fee has been paid to obtain exclusive right from the parent
company for manufacture and sale of the products in India.
• The license agreement led to the setting up of a new factory based on new
technology obtained through the license agreement.
The aforesaid findings/ observations of the assessing officer are erroneous,
based on incorrect appreciation of the facts and the settled legal position,
as pointed out by the Ld. AR hereinafter. It was contended by the Assessing
Officer that the life cycle of a car is much less than the term of the
agreement. In this regard, the Ld. AR submitted that even assuming (without
admitting) the life cycle of a car to be so, still the conclusion of the
assessing officer based on the so-called life cycle of a car vis-a-vis tenure
of agreement being 10 years is totally erroneous. The assessing officer, it is
respectfully submitted, failed to appreciate that 10 years is merely the
tenure of the agreement and if the assessee were to manufacture a particular
car for say 5 years only, then, the royalty payment would accordingly be
payable for that period. Thus, the tenure  115 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 of
agreement being 10 years was totally irrelevant for period. Thus, the tenure
of agreement being 10 years was totally irrelevant for holding that the
agreement resulted in more than enduring benefit to the assessee. In order to
determine the nature of the royalty payment, whether capital or revenue, what
is material is the underlying purpose for which payment is made and not the
tenure. If the payment is for use of technical knowhow simplicit or, as
opposed to acquisition of proprietary rights therein, then, the payment has to
be regarded as revenue, irrespective of the tenure for which permission is
granted for such use. In the present case, under the license agreement, the
assessee was, as stated above, merely granted permission/ access to the
technical knowhow for the limited purpose of use in the business of
manufacturing cars. The assessee only has the right to use the technology
relating to the new models during the currency of the agreement. The
proprietary rights on the know-how and the intellectual property rights in
relation thereto continue to be owned by SMC. In view of the aforesaid, the
mere fact that agreement is for 10 years, extendable by 5 years, is irrelevant
for determining the nature of royalty payment. Further, the assessing officer
stated that the assessee acquired an enduring advantage as the right to
manufacture the products and parts is available even after the expiry of the
term of the agreement. In this regard, it is reiterated that the Courts have
in the following cases held that in the absence of clause of return of
documentation/know-how and the fact that the assessee was entitled to carry on
manufacturing activities with use of such know- how/documentation even after
the expiry of the agreement, did not alter the nature of transaction or result
in any benefit of enduring character to the assessee. The Ld. AR relied upon
the following decisions:
• Praga Tools Ltd. v. CIT : 123 ITR 773 (AP)(FB) • CIT v. Tata Engineering &
Locomotive Co. Pvt. Ltd. 123 ITR 538 (Bom) • Shriram Refrigeration Industries
Ltd. v. CIT: 127 ITR 746 (Del) • Triveni Engineering Works Ltd. V. CIT: 136
ITR 340 (Del) • CIT v. Bhai Sunder Dass & Sons (P) Ltd.: 158 ITR 195 (Del.)
116 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 • CIT v. Hero Honda Motors Ltd.: 372 ITR 481 (Del.) •
CIT v. B.N. Elias & Co. (P) Ltd.: 168 ITR 190 (Cal.) • CIT v. Avery India
Ltd.: 207 ITR 813 (Cal.) • SRP Tools Ltd. v CIT: 237 ITR 684(Mad) • CIT v.

Pistons and Rings Ltd.: 219 CTR 228 (Del.) • CIT v. J.K. Synthetics Ltd.: 176
Taxman 355 (Del.) Further, the Ld. AR pointed out that it has been held in the
following judicial precedents that where the assessee continued to manufacture
using the technology obtained even after expiry of the agreement, the same was
not conclusive and the expenditure would be allowable revenue expenditure, if
on a cumulative reading of the agreement, it appeared that the assessee did
not acquire any asset or enduring advantage in the capital field:
• CIT v. Tata Engineering Ltd: 123 ITR 538 (Bom.) (HC) • Praga Tools Ltd. v.
CIT: 123 ITR 733 (AP) • ACIT v. Shama Engine Valves Ltd.: 138 ITR 216 (Del) •
CIT v. J.K Synthetics : 309 ITR 371 (Del) • CIT v. B. N Elias & Co. Ltd.: 168
ITR 190 (Guj) • CIT v. Avery India Ltd.: 207 ITR 813 (Cal) • SRP Tools Ltd. v.
CIT: 237 ITR 684 (Mad) • Mysore Kirloskar Ltd. : 114 ITR 443 The assessing
officer further stated that the assessee obtained an exclusive license to
manufacture the products and parts in India in as much as the licensor (SMC)
agreed not to manufacture similar products in India nor to provide the
technology to any other party. In this regard, the Ld. AR submitted that the
exclusive license by itself would not, it is respectfully submitted, render
the expenditure by way of royalty as capital in nature on the ground  117 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 that same has resulted in enduring benefit. As elaborately
discussed earlier, the exclusive license seeks to protect the
profitability/market of the assessee from/for manufacturing and selling the
vehicles/cars in India, during the currency of the agreement, by eliminating
competition from any other manufacturer(s), who may seek to manufacture
similar vehicles in India. The exclusive license, thus, merely enables the
existing business of manufacture to be carried on more efficiently and
profitably, without any addition to the profit earning or capital apparatus.
The enduring benefit, if any, is thus, on revenue account. The observation of
the assessing officer that the license Agreement led to the assessee setting
up a new factory based on new technology is factually incorrect. In this
regard, it is pertinent to note that no new plant/ factory was set up by the
assessee on the basis of the agreement entered into for use of technical
knowledge/ information. The assessing officer failed to appreciate that the
assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture of automobiles since 1982.
The assessee is not making payment in the initial year of setting up of the
factory, which is operative and running at the time of entering into the
subject Agreement. Various models of the cars introduced by the assessee from
time to time are nothing but part of the existing business of the assessee.
Therefore, the mere fact that new models/ variants of cars are introduced by
the assessee based on the license agreement does not mean that an altogether
new product was manufactured. That apart, even if various variants of car are
treated as different/ new products, still, having regard to the fact that the
same were part of the very same business of the assessee of manufacturing of
cars, no new business was set up so as to regard the payment of royalty as
resulting in an enduring benefit to the assessee. The said payment of royalty
therefore does not result in acquisition by the assessee of any asset or
advantage of enduring benefit which is in the "capital field" as explained by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Empire Jute case 124 ITR 1 (SC), which is
necessary in order to consider the same as capital expenditure. The payment of
the entire royalty, both Lumpsum and running royalty, therefore needs to be
allowed revenue deduction. The aforesaid issue has been decided in favour of
the  118 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the AY 2006-07, AY 2007-08 and AY 2008-09 holding that
amount of royalty considered by the assessing officer as capital expenditure
should be allowed as revenue expenditure. In view of the aforesaid, the
assessing officer should be directed to allow the entire royalty payment as
allowable revenue deduction.
57\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
58\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. The Tribunal held in A.Y. 2008-09 as under:
"Ground No 9 to 9.3 disallowance of expenditure of Rs. 192.77 Cr out of the
total amount of Rs.495.15 Cr incurred on account of royalty.
9\. Insofar as the disallowance of Rs.192.77 Crores royalty paid to Suzuki
Motor Corporation, Japan ('SMC'), is concerned, according to the assessee,
during the year under consideration, the assessee paid royalty of
Rs.495,15,40,443/- to Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan ('SMC') for use of
licensed information for the engineering, design and development, manufacture,
testing, quality control, sale and after sales service of products and parts,
but the assessing officer, in the impugned assessment order, has held that
inasmuch as the life cycle of a car is only 5 years whereas the licence
agreement is for 10 years, extendable by 5 years and even thereafter the
assessee can produce the said model of car, and the licence agreement led to
the assessee setting up a new factory based on new technology, and for these
reasons the assessee had enduring benefit as such royalty paid by the assessee
was capital in nature, and consequently, held that the entire royalty is
disallowable. On this premise, basing on the adjustment of Rs.237.24  119 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 crores, made by TPO the assessing officer has computed the
disallowance out of royalty payments to a tune of Rs. 192.77 Cr.
9.1. It is the argument of the Ld. AR that the assessing officer failed to
appreciate the fact that the nature and purpose for which the royalty has been
paid to SMC is only the use of licensed information for the engineering,
design and development, manufacture, testing, quality control, sale and after
sales service of Products and Parts, and as per clause 7.01 of the agreement
the duration of the agreement has been specified as 10 years and vide clause
7.04 of the agreement it was subject to termination at earlier date for
breach. He submitted that as evidenced by clause 2.02 of the agreement SMC
does not transfer to MSIL any specific patents or copyrights or other secret
or protected information or knowhow so as to make MSIL a proprietor of the
same or so as to enable MSIL to exercise proprietary rights such as
unrestricted rights of transfer to third party, either by way or assignment or
license.
9.2. According to him in order to determine the nature of the royalty payment,
whether capital or revenue, what is material is the underlying purpose for
which payment is made and not the tenure or its extendibility or the life
cycle of the product that is manufactured with the help of the technology that
is accessed from SMC. If the payment is for use of technical knowhow,
simplicitor, then the payment has to be regarded as revenue, irrespective of
the tenure for which permission is granted for such use. Since in the present
case, under the License Agreement, the assessee was merely granted permission
to access the technical knowhow for the limited purpose of using the
technology relating to the new models during the currency of the agreement and
the proprietary rights for the know-how and the intellectual property  120 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 rights in relation thereto continue to be owned by SMC alone,
the payment is undoubtedly revenue in nature.
9.3. While placing reliance on Circular No. 21 of 1969 issued by CBDT, he
argued that if in terms of the Agreement, only a license is obtained for user
of technical knowledge from a foreign participant for a limited period
together with or without the right to use the patents and trademarks of the
foreign party, the payment would not bring into existence an asset of enduring
advantage to the Indian party. He further submitted that while following the
aforesaid Circular, the jurisdictional Delhi High Court in case of CIT v Lumax
Industries Limited: 173 Taxman 390 held that similar royalty payment was
allowable as revenue deduction.
9.4. He submitted that in a host of decisions, namely, CIT v. Ciba India Ltd:
69 ITR 692 (SC) , Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. v. CIT: 177 ITR 377 (SC),
CIT v. Shriram Pistons and Rings Limited -CC 12154/2009 (SC) (dismissing the

Healthcare Ltd. v DCIT : 175 TTJ 552 (Chd. Trib.), the issue of allowability
of royalty payments as revenue expenditure is covered in favour of the
assessee company.
9.5. He further relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High
Court in the case of CIT v. J.K Synthetics: 309 ITR 371@ pg 391, wherein while
culling out legal principles based on various decisions it was held that the
fact that assessee could use the technical knowledge obtained during the
tenure of the License for the purposes of its business after the agreement has
expired, and in that sense, resulting in an enduring advantage, has been
categorically rejected by the Courts, and that this, by itself, cannot be
decisive because knowledge by itself may last for a long period even though
due to rapid change of technology and huge strides made in the field of
science, the knowledge may with passage of time become obsolete. Ld. AR
disputed the factual correctness of the observation of the assessing officer
that the license Agreement led to the assessee setting up a new factory based
on new technology, and submitted that no new plant/ factory was setup by the
assessee on the basis of the agreement entered into for use of technical
knowledge/ information. According to him the assessing officer failed to
appreciate that the assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture of
automobiles and various models of the cars introduced  122 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 by the assessee from time to time are nothing but part of the
same business of the assessee, as such the mere fact that new models/ variants
of car are introduced by the assessee based on the license agreement does not
mean that an altogether new product was manufactured. He made a reference to
the decisions of the Delhi High Court in case of CIT v. Hero Honda Motors
Ltd.: 372 ITR 481 and decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case
of Hero Honda Motors Limited v. DCIT: ITA no. 5130/Del/2010 for A.Y. 2006-07,
and also to the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of
Hero Honda Motors Limited v. DCIT in ITA Nos. 716 to 718/Del/2008 for the
assessment years 2000-01 to 2002-03 wherein, a coordinate Bench of this
Tribunal, after analyzing all the decisions, held royalty to be in the nature
of revenue expenditure even though royalty was paid for exclusive use of
technical knowhow/ information, the agreement was for 10 years and extendable,
the assessee was permitted to continue to manufacture motorcycles even after
termination of the agreement. Lastly he submitted that the aforesaid issue has
now been decided in favour of the assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal
in assessee's own case for the AY2006-07 and AY 2007-08holding that amount of
royalty considered by AO as capital expenditure should be allowed as revenue
expenditure. For these reasons he prayed that the assessing officer may be
directed to allow the entire royalty payment as allowable revenue deduction.
9.6. Per contra, Ld. DR vehemently defended the observations of the AO, while
submitting that in the scenario of a New Model coming every 2nd or 3rd year
and the old Models getting phased out, License Agreement is for 10 years,
extendable by 5 years and even thereafter MSIL can produce the said model of
Car, is more than enduring.
123 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Further, there has been technology transfer for manufacturing the product, and
the personnel of the company have been technically trained. The transfer of
technology is as per the License Agreement but the Skill which has been
acquired year after year due to training of the companies personnel has been
absorbed in the company and can be used across the other Products. This is
again an enduring benefit. Referring to the cases cited by the Ld. AR, it is
the argument of the Ld. DR that in all the cases where the Courts have held
that the Royalty payment is Revenue and not capital are the ones where the
License Agreement was only to approach or access the technology without
imparting any trade secrets and above all the time period was much short, say
5 years or less coupled with the fact that , the product was different and the
right given was not exclusive. He submitted that the Tribunal's order in
assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 cannot be relied upon because on this
aspect the Tribunal was swayed by the assessee contention that TPO has
disallowed the royalty, but as a matter of fact, TPO had determined the value
of the ALP of the co- branding done by Suzuki. The value of the same is
determined by equating the trade mark royalty Maruti was paying to Suzuki for
its brand. The logic is simple if Maruti was paying licensed trade name
royalty to Suzuki then Suzuki should also be paying back the trade name
royalty to Maruti. Whereas it is a fact that royalty being paid is a composite
royalty including the usage of Trademark and technical information. It is
Suzuki who has been charging this royalty even if its name was used only on
the rear of the vehicle. But now after taking over the management of the
company, it has repositioned its name and brand and logo on these vehicles.
The question is whether any independent party that had assiduously over the
years have built up a  124 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 name and reputation would have
allowed so? And that too absolutely free when the other party had been
throughout charging it for whatever it was providing it be it machinery,
technology, spare parts, technical assistance, corporate guarantee, trade
name, trade mark. That does not seem to be a situation in normal and
independent circumstances and this was not appreciated by the Tribunal, as a
consequence of which the Revenue preferr3d an appeal on this issue also.
According to him, the Tribunal had merely relied on its order for earlier
years which in turn relied merely on decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (2015) 372 ITR 481 (Del) and not discussed the facts
that are recorded in the assessment order. It is submitted that on the basis
of the facts mentioned in the assessment order, the ratio decidendi of the
Delhi High Court decision in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (supra) would not be
applicable in the instant case. Lastly, it is argued by the Ld. DR that these
are continuous issues forming part of the assessment order for AY 2005-06,
2006-07 and 2007-08 also, and are at present pending adjudication before
Hon'ble Delhi High Court.
9.7. On this issue, a coordinate Bench of This tribunal in assessee's own case
for AY 2007-08, vide para 20.5 and 20.6 on page 91-93 of order, referred to
order for AY 2006-07 and held as under:
"8.5. The ld. DR has relied on certain decisions, which categorize payment for
use of technical know-how etc. as a capital expenditure. Similarly, the ld. AR
has also relied on certain decision which mark such payment as a revenue
expense. In all these decisions, the dividing line is whether the
consideration is for purchase of technical information, know-how information,
designs and drawings, etc., or for its use. If it is for use alone, then it is
revenue and vice versa. Recently, the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court in CIT
vs. Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (2015) 372 ITR 481 (Del), on consideration of the
relevant clauses of the agreement before it, which considerably match with the
Agreement under consideration, has held that the payments made for Model fee
(which is equivalent of Lumpsum royalty in our case) and Running royalty are
revenue expenses. In this judgment, the Hon'ble  125 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
jurisdictional High Court has considered several judgments of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court and Hon'ble High Courts and on consideration of their cumulative
effect, it has come to the conclusion that both the amounts are revenue in
nature. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in an earlier judgment in Shriram
Refrigeration Industries Ltd. vs. CIT (1981) 127 ITR 746 (Del), has held that
the lumpsum royalty is a revenue expenditure. After going through the relevant
clauses of the Agreement, we have noted that royalty paid by the assessee is
for use of licensed information and no part of the same is towards its
acquisition as an owner. In the light of the above discussion, it is
absolutely clear that the view canvassed by the AO in treating this amount as
capital expenditure, is not sustainable. 8.6. Our above finding decides the
nature of royalty payment for use of licensed information as revenue
expenditure and not its quantum part. We have noticed above that the tribunal
in its order for the immediately preceding year has also given some
observations, which prima facie indicate that the entire amount of royalty is
for the use of licensed information. Since we have held the royalty for use of
licensed information as revenue expenditure, the quantification aspect becomes
irrelevant. It is so because the TPO has held royalty for use of licensed
information at ALP. We, therefore, hold that the amount of royalty considered
by the AO as capital expenditure should be allowed as a revenue expenditure.
At the same time, depreciation allowed by the AO on this amount should be
taken back."
9.8. Following the above decision for AY 2006-07, which is on an identical
issue in the case of assessee itself, this Tribunal for the AY 2007-08 hold
that the amount of royalty considered by the Assessing Officer as capital
expenditure should be allowed as a revenue expenditure, and at the same time,
depreciation allowed by the Assessing Officer on this amount should be taken
back. This tribunal specifically held that the terms of the agreement
considered by the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court in CIT vs. Hero Honda
Motors Ltd. (2015) 372 ITR 481 (Del), are considerably matching with the
Agreement under consideration. On the face of this observation, without the
same being disturbed by the higher forums, we find it difficult to countenance
the argument of the Ld. DR that the ratio decidendi of the Delhi High Court
decision in Hero Honda Motors Ltd.
126 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
(supra) would not be applicable in the facts of the instant case. We,
therefore, respectfully following the same hold that the amount of royalty
considered by the Assessing Officer as capital expenditure should be allowed
as a revenue expenditure, and at the same time, depreciation allowed by the
Assessing Officer on this amount should be taken back. Grounds No 9 to 9.3
are, accordingly, allowed."
Thus, this issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the decision
of the Tribunal for the earlier Assessment year i.e. A.Y. 2008-09. Therefore,
in absence of any contrary material brought to our notice by the Ld. DR
against the order of the Tribunal, we allow these grounds. Hence Ground No. 7
to 7.3 are allowed.
59\. In result, Ground No. 7 to 7.3 are allowed
60\. Ground No. 7.4 to 7.7 is regarding disallowance of R & D Cess paid. The
Ld. AR stated that during the year under consideration, the assessee claimed
net deduction of Rs.32,03,13,445/- on account of R&D Cess on royalty. The
assessing officer has disallowed the payment of R&D cess on ground that since
the entire royalty expenditure is a capital expenditure, therefore, cess on
royalty also needs to be capitalized. At the outset, it may be mentioned that
as per the provisions of Research and Development Cess Act, 1986, R&D cess is
imposed on import of technology by the Government of India. Further, the
applicant has been instructed by the Government of India to pay R&D cess on
the payment of royalty. Such, R&D cess, being a statutory payment, is governed
by section 43B of the Act, which is a separate code in itself and overrides
other provisions of the Act. It is not in dispute that the R&D cess has
actually been paid to the Government within the time limits prescribed by
section 43 B of the Act. Section 43B of the Act allows payment of statutory
dues on payment basis. Any expense which is laid out or expended wholly and
exclusively for the purposes of the business of the assessee and which is not
in  127 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the nature of capital expenditure or personal
expenses are allowable under the Act. The assessee has given detailed factual
and legal arguments in the earlier part of this submission as to why the
royalty payment be considered as revenue expenditure. The Ld. AR submitted
that the aforesaid issue is dependent and interlinked to the issue of royalty
expenditure, since if it is held that royalty payments by assessee is a
revenue expenditure, the R&D cess should also be considered as a revenue
expenditure. The aforesaid issue has been decided in favour of the assessee by
the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for the AY 2006-07, AY
2007-08 and AY 2008-09.
61\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
62\. We have heard both the parties and perused the relevant material
available on record. We find that in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09, the
Tribunal held as under:
Ground No 10 to 10.2 disallowance of Rs.16,93,68,741/- on account of R&D Cess
on Royalty
10\. Case of assessee in respect of Disallowance of R&D Cess paid, is that as
per provisions of Research and Development Cess Act, 1986, R&D cess is imposed
on import of technology by the Government of India, which is definitely not a
related party of the appellant company, and the assessee has been instructed
by the Government of India's approval for remittance of royalty to pay R&D
cess on the payment of royalty. R&D cess, being a statutory payment, is
governed by section 43B, which is a separate code in itself and overrides the
other provisions of the Act. Further according to the assessee, this issue is
dependent and interlinked to the issue of royalty expenditure, and if it is
held that royalty payments by assessee are revenue expenditure, then the R&D
cess should also be considered as a revenue expenditure.
128 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Ld. DR submitted that the issue of R&D Cess paid by the assessee is decided in
favour of the assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own
case for the AY 2006-07 and AY 2007-08.
10.1. This issue is based on Ground No. 9 above, i.e. capitalisation of
Royalty expenditure. The ITAT has also decided this issue in favour of the
assessee on the basis of its decision on Ground No. 9. Since the decision of
the ITAT in Ground No. 9 is not acceptable, therefore, its decision on this
issue is also not acceptable. It is further averred that these are continuous
issues forming part of the assessment order for AY 2006-07 and 2007-08 also,
and are at present pending adjudication before Hon'ble Delhi High Court.
10.2. In the Order for the AY 2007-08, a coordinate Bench of this Tribunal
found that this issue has been decided in the case of assessee itself in the
appeal before the ITAT for the assessment year 2006-07 and in that case it was
held that:
"9. The next ground is disallowance of R&D cess paid amounting to
Rs.9,68,47,294/-. Relevant discussion has been made by the AO on page 26 of
his final order. The assessee treated the amount of royalty and cess on
royalty as revenue expenditure. The AO disallowed a sum of Rs.9.68 crore after
proportionately allowing deduction to the extent of depreciation allowed by
him on royalty. There is no dispute on the nature of cess, which is on royalty
and has been treated both by the assessee as well as the AO as part and parcel
of royalty and accordingly claimed/disallowed in line with the treatment of
royalty. Since we have allowed deduction for the entire amount of royalty paid
by the assessee during the year by deleting the TP adjustment and also
overturning the action of the AO in treating the remaining half part as
capital expenditure, the consequential amount of cess on royalty payment
automatically becomes deductible. We, therefore, direct to allow deduction of
Rs.9.68 crore. "
10.3. This Tribunal followed the above reasoning for the AY 2007-
129 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
08 also. Since the related facts of the present assessment year are similar to
those in the assessment year 2006- 07 and 2007-08 on an identical issue, we,
while respectfully following the same direct the Assessing Officer to allow
the deduction as directed by the ITAT in the appeal for the assessment year
2006-07 and 2007-08 after affording opportunity of being heard to the
assessee. Grounds 10 to 10.2 are allowed accordingly."
Thus, the issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the decision
of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y.2008-09. Therefore, in absence
of any contrary material brought to our notice by the Ld. DR against the order
of the Tribunal, we allow these grounds. Hence Ground No. 74 to 7.7 are
allowed.
63\. In result, Ground No. 7.4 to 7.7 are allowed.
64\. Ground No. 8 to 8.2 is regarding disallowance on account of Expenditure
on Excise Duty. The Ld. AR submitted that the assessee had, during the
relevant assessment year, paid excise duty of Rs.67,00,000/-, being provision
for MODVAT on quantity difference on inputs disallowed in earlier years now
claimed on payment basis u/s 43B of the Act. The assessing officer disallowed
the aforesaid claim of the assessee on the ground that assessee would not have
been liable to make the aforesaid payments of Rs.67,00,000/- to the Excise
Department if it had been able to establish that all consumptions claimed by
it were for the purposes of manufacturing. In this regard, the Ld. AR
submitted that the payment made by the assessee is clearly in the nature of
excise duty, which is clearly admissible as deduction on payment basis under
section 43B of the Act. It is pertinent to note that in the context of similar
duty payment for assessment year 2000- 01, the Excise Tribunal (CESTAT) has
held that there is no shortage of stocks of raw material and the minor
discrepancy is the result of accounting error due to use of large quantity of
inputs procured from several  130 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 hundred suppliers. The
issue is also covered in favour of the assessee by the orders of the Tribunal
in the assessee's own case for AYs 2000-01, 2001-02, AY 2002-03, AY 2007-08
and AY 2008- 09. The orders of the Tribunal have been affirmed by Delhi High
Court for Assessment Years 2000-01 (Ita No. 976/2005) 2001-02 (ITA No.
519/2010).
65\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
66\. We have heard both the parties and perused the relevant material
available on record. We find that in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09, the
Tribunal held as under:
Ground Nos 13 to 13.3 disallowance Rs.58,61,136/- on account of Expenditure on
Excise duty:
13\. In respect of disallowance Rs.58,61,136/- on account of Expenditure on
Excise duty, case of the assessee is that during the relevant assessment year,
the assessee paid excise duty of Rs.58,61,136/-, being provision for MODVAT on
quantity difference on inputs disallowed in earlier years now claimed on
payment basis u/s 43B of the Act, but the assessing officer disallowed the
aforesaid claim on the ground that assessee would not have been liable to make
the aforesaid payments of Rs.58,61,136/- to the Excise Department if it had
been able to establish that all consumptions claimed by it were for the
purposes of manufacturing. Assessee submits that the payment made by them is
clearly in the nature of excise duty, which is admissible as deduction on
payment basis under section 43B of the Act.
131 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
13.1. Ld. AR submits that the issue is also covered in favour of the assessee
by the orders of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for AYs 2000-01,
2001-02, AY 2002-03 and AY 2007-08.
13.2. Per contra, it is the argument of the Ld. DR that this issue is related
to the disallowance u/s. 43B for the year immediately preceding the previous
year, and the ITAT has allowed this expenditure following the same principle
laid down earlier to allow relief to the assessee on the issue of excise duty
and customs duty. According to the Ld. DR, if this proposition is accepted in
the current year, it shall defeat the very purpose of making the disallowance
in the previous year and moreover, Revenue has not accepted the proposition of
ITAT in allowing relief to the assessee and in that sense is a live issue.
Accepting the decision of tribunal on this issue shall give finality to this
issue for that particular year only. It is further averred that these are
continuous issues forming part of the assessment order for AY 2005-06, 2006-07
and 2007-08 also, and are at present pending adjudication before Hon'ble Delhi
High Court.
13.3. On a perusal of the decision, we find that this issue is substantially
involved in Ground Nos. 14 to 14.3 in the assessee's appeal for AY 2007-08,
and on this aspect, a coordinate Bench of this Tribunal held as under:
"27.3 We find that in its order dated 16.10.2012 in the case of assessee
itself for the assessment year 2002-03, an identical issue has been decided in
favour of the assessee by the ITAT following its earlier orders. Relevant para
No. 50 thereof is being reproduced hereunder:
> 50\. We have heard both the sides on this issue. This issue is covered in
> favour of the assessee by the decision of ITAT in assessee's own case for
> assessment years 2000-01 and 2001-02. The relevant para of the order for
> assessment year 2001-02 is reproduced hereunder:
132 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
> "22. In regard to Ground No. 9 which is against the action of CIT(A) in
> deleting the disallowance of the Excise Duty paid by the assessee
> representing the reversal of the excise MODVAT availed in inputs on
> clearance of finished goods, it was fairly conceded by both the sides that
> this issue was squarely covered by the decision of the co-ordinate bench in
> assessee's own case for assessment year 2000-01 in ITA No. 678/Del/2004.
> Respectfully following the decision f the Co-ordinate Bench of this Tribunal
> in assessee's own case for assessment year 2000-
> 01, the findings of the CIT(A) on this issue stands confirmed.
> 23\. It is also noticed that this Excise Duty is paid against the order of
> the Settlement Commission and is in the nature of reversal of MODVAT availed
> on the inputs and not in the nature of penalty or fines. In the
> circumstances, the ground of appeal as raised by the Revenue on this issue
> stands dismissed."
> 27.4 In view of the above finding of the ITAT on the issue and of the Excise
> Tribunal in the assessment year 2000-01 that shortage of stock of raw-
> material and the minor discrepancy was the result of accounting error due to
> use of large quantity of inputs procured from several hundred suppliers, we
> hold that the assessee was justified in claiming Rs.77 lacs on account of
> expenditure on excise duty on payment basis under sec. 43B of the Act. The
> Assessing Officer is accordingly directed to allow the claim. Ground Nos. 14
> to 14.3 are thus allowed."
13.4. When the facts are similar and a particular view is taken by a
coordinate Bench of this Tribunal for the earlier years, it is not desirable
to deviate from the same in a subsequent year in the absence of any change of
circumstances, as such by respectfully following the same, we direct the
Assessing Officer to allow the deduction of Rs.58,61,136/- representing the
excise duty paid by the appellant during the relevant previous year. Grounds
No 13 to 13.3 are allowed accordingly."
Thus, the issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee by the Tribunal
in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09. Therefore, in absence of any contrary
material brought to our notice by the Ld. DR against the order of the
Tribunal, we allow these grounds. Hence Ground No. 8 to 8.2 are allowed  133
ITA No. 467/Del/2014
67\. In result, Ground No. 8 to 8.2 are allowed.
68\. Ground No. 9 to 9.5 is regarding disallowance on account of Provisional
Liability Expenditure on account of FPI-OE Components. The assessee had
accounted for liability on account of foreseen price increase (FPI) based on
scientific analysis of increase in input prices, on purchases already made by
the company at provisional prices, and on which the final price is yet to be
settled with the supplier. FPI of Rs.36,38,43,197/- was debited to consumption
of raw material and components in the profit and loss account in accordance
with mercantile system of accounting. The same was claimed as business
deduction in the computation of income. Vendor-wise details of total provision
of Rs.36,38,43,197/- made during the relevant year was submitted before the
Assessing Officer. The said practice was in consonance with the provisions of
the Companies Act and generally accepted accounting principles and practices
of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The assessing officer however,
disallowed the aforesaid claim of the assessee on the ground that assessee has
quantified the liability without acknowledging the quantified liability to the
creditors. The Ld. AR submitted that liability for FPI was provided in the
books of accounts on a scientific analysis of increase in price of components
due to change in input cost. The liability of FPI was estimated by the
purchase department with substantial degree of accuracy as they are in
constant touch with suppliers and have knowledge of the claims of suppliers,
trend of the cost of inputs, etc. The personnel in the purchase department
updates the foreseen price of each component for each supplier and effective
date, based on their input and available information. The accounting of FPI
was justified on account of following reasons:
(a) The liability was booked on account of materials already supplied by
suppliers and not on an ad hoc or arbitrary basis.
134 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
b) The amount was determined and computed with a substantial degree of
accuracy at the time of determining and booking the amount as per information
available till date of finalization of accounts
c) The liability was required to be booked as per accrual system of accounting
as the goods were already received.
The Ld. AR submitted that FPI is an existing liability as per the
understanding arrived at with the suppliers of the components, who are
original manufacturers of the components. It is on the basis of analysis of
the claims, price trend, and correspondences/discussions/negotiations with the
suppliers during the year and past dealings that the assessee had computed the
impact of change in price of components. The change in price of the components
takes place to give effect to the increase in the cost of the inputs required
for manufacturing of the components. The same is as per the agreement with the
suppliers to ensure uninterrupted supply of components, even when their cost
has been increased. The Ld. AR also submitted that such practice is quite
common in the motor vehicle industry which has also been duly recognized in
the departmental clarification issued by the Central Excise Department. Thus,
the Ld. AR submitted that it is not a case of provisional liability/contingent
liability incurring of which is dependent on happening of an event. The
liability, in our respectful submission, is in fact in respect of such
purchases already made by the assessee and duly debited in the books of
accounts. Thus, the amount of FPI is a liability which accrues simultaneously
with each purchase made by assessee and is allowable as deduction in
determining the income of the relevant assessment year. The aforesaid is
further in accordance with practice prevalent in motor vehicles industry.
Reference in this regard is invited to a notification dated 28.7.2003 issued
by the Excise Authorities on the subject of charging of interest under section
11AB wherein the excise authorities recognized prevailing commercial practice
of supplementary invoices being made in addition to the original invoices. The
liability on account  135 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 of FPI was an ascertained
liability representing additional purchase price of the goods. Since the
liability accrued during the relevant assessment year, even though was finally
paid in the following assessment years, the same was allowable deduction. The
Ld. AR relied upon the following decisions wherein it has been held that
liability which has arisen in the relevant accounting year is an allowable
deduction even though its actual quantification and discharge is deferred to a
future date:
a) Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd.: 37 ITR 1 (SC)
b) Metal Box (P) Limited (1969): 73 ITR 53 (SC)
c) United Commercial Bank v. CIT 240 ITR 355 (SC)
d) Bharat Earth Movers: 245 ITR 428 (SC)
e) Kelvinator of India Ltd. reported in 256 ITR 1 confirmed by SC in 320 ITR
561
f) CIT v Vinitec Corpn. (P) Ltd.: 278 ITR 337 (Delhi)
g) National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. v. JCIT : 98 ITD 278 (Hyd.
ITAT) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT v. Woodward Governor India
(P) Ltd. 312 ITR 254 has held that:-
> g) "21. In conclusion, we may state that in order to find out if an
> expenditure is deductible the following have to be taken into account (i)
> whether the system of accounting followed by the assessee is mercantile
> system, which brings into debit the expenditure amount for which a legal
> liability has been incurred before it is actually disbursed and brings into
> credit what is due, immediately it becomes due and before it is actually
> received; (ii) whether the same system is followed by the assessee from the
> very beginning and if there was a change in the system, whether the change
> was bona fide; (iii) whether the assessee has given the same treatment to
> losses claimed to have accrued and to the gains that may accrue to it; (iv)
> whether the assessee has been consistent and definite in  136 ITA No.
> 467/Del/2014 making entries in the account books in respect of losses and
> gains; (v) whether the method adopted by the assessee for making entries in
> the books both in respect of losses and gains is as per nationally accepted
> accounting standards; (vi) whether the system adopted by the assessee is
> fair and reasonable or is adopted only with a view to reducing the incidence
> of taxation. "
The Ld. AR further relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
of Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd. vs CIT: 314 ITR 62 wherein it has been held
that:-
"17. At this stage, we once again reiterate that a liability is a present
obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to
result in an outflow of resources and in respect of which a reliable estimate
is possible of the amount of obligation. "
The Ld. AR submitted that the invoices, raised by the suppliers, were
provisional and each invoice was liable to be reviewed/ amended once the
quantum is determined and that this quantum of increase would apply to re-
compute the prices payable by assessee on all supplies made by the suppliers
during the year. The aforesaid method of accounting regularly and consistently
followed does not lead to any loss of revenue, whatsoever. The liability
estimated in a particular year finally settled in the subsequent year gets
reflected in the profit & loss account. The income as well as the charge on
settlement in the subsequent year is brought to the income or expenses
statement of the assessee company to the extent of variation from the actual
FPI liability. It is well settled that mere timing difference should not be
used to disturb the method of accounting and books of accounts of a tax payer
consistently maintained and accepted year after year. The Ld. AR further
submitted that the aforesaid method of accounting has been regularly followed
by assessee and claims were accordingly made which has been duly accepted by
Revenue in all the preceding years except in assessment year AY 2003-04,  137
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 AY 2007-08 and 2008-09. There has been no change in
method of accounting or estimation. The Ld. AR submitted that it is a well
settled position of law that while the principle of res judicata does not
apply to the income-tax proceedings, the Courts have emphasized there must be
consistency in the position that the Revenue takes on an issue in different
assessment years. The Ld. AR relied upon the following decisions:
• CIT vs. Excel Industries (P) Limited: 358 ITR 295 (SC) • Radhasoami Satsang
v. CIT 193 ITR 321 (SC) • DIT (E) v. Apparel Export Promotion Council: 244 ITR
734 (Del) • CIT v. Neo Polypack (P) Ltd: 245 ITR 492 (Del.) • CIT v. Girish
Mohan Ganeriwala: 260 ITR 417 (P&H) • CIT V. Dalmia Promoters Developers (P)
Ltd: 200 CTR 426 (Del.) • Escorts Cardiac Diseases Hospital: 300 ITR 75 (Del)
The Ld. AR further submitted that against the total accrued liability claimed
during the year amounting to Rs.36.38 crores, the entire amount has either
been paid or written-back and offered for tax as part of his chargeable income
in assessment year 2010-11. The amount of write-back could, in law, be taxed
by the Assessing Officer in assessment year 2010-11 only if the same was an
allowable deduction from the assessee's assessable income in assessment year
2009-10. Further, the payment made in next year against the liability for
foreseen price increase of previous year should be allowed as deduction in
Assessment Year 2010-11. The issue now stands squarely covered in favour of
the assessee by the order of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the
assessment years 2007-08 and 2008-09, wherein the Tribunal held that provision
for foreseen price increase made by the assessee represented an
accrued/crystallized liability, which is an allowable business deduction.
69\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
138 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
70\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. We find, the Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y.
2008- 09 has held as under:
Ground No 12 to 12.5 Disallowance on account of Provisional Liability relating
to Expenditure on account of FPI-OE Components
12\. On the aspect of Disallowance of Rs.32,11,63,153 on account of
Provisional Liability relating to Expenditure on account of FPI-OE Components,
case of the assessee is that the assessee had accounted for liability on
account foreseen price increase (FPI) on an estimate basis, this FPI of
Rs.32,11,63,153 was debited to consumption of raw material and components in
the profit and loss account in accordance with mercantile system of accounting
and the same was claimed as business deduction in the computation of income.
Grievance of the assessee is that the assessing officer however, disallowed
the aforesaid claim of the assessee on the ground that assessee has quantified
the liability without acknowledging the quantified liability to the creditors.
However, according to the assessee the change in price of the components takes
place to give effect to the increase in the cost of the inputs required for
manufacturing of the components. The same is, as per the agreement with the
suppliers, to ensure uninterrupted supply of components, even when their cost
has increased. According to the assessee FPI is an existing liability as per
the understanding arrived at with the suppliers of the components, who are
original manufacturers of the components. It is submitted on behalf of the
assessee that the liability of FPI was estimated by the purchase department
with substantial degree of accuracy as they are in constant touch with  139
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 suppliers and have knowledge of the claims of suppliers,
trend of the cost of inputs, etc. The personnel in the purchase department
updates the foreseen price of each component for each supplier and effective
date, based on their input and available information in computer system
regarding quantity purchased and price paid. The liability in respect of each
component was worked out considering the weight of each material, the quantity
procured, the old rate and new rate worked by the assessee considering the
price changes occurred during the period. It is on the basis of analysis of
the claims, price trend, and correspondences/ discussions/negotiations with
the suppliers during the year and past dealings that the assessee had computed
the impact of change in price of components, and, therefore, it is not a case
of provisional liability/contingent liability, incurring of which is dependent
on happening of an event, but in fact it is in respect of such purchases
already made by the assessee and duly debited in the books of accounts
resulting in that the amount of FPI is a liability which accrues
simultaneously with each purchase made by assessee and is allowable as
deduction in determining the income of the relevant assessment year. The
accounting of FPI was justified by the assessee on account of the liability
that was determined and computed with a substantial degree of accuracy on
account of materials already supplied by suppliers, at the time of determining
and booking the amount as per information available till date of finalization
of accounts and such a liability was required to be booked as per accrual
system of accounting as the goods were already received. According to the Ld.
AR this practice of provision for FPI is in accordance with practice prevalent
in motor vehicles industry. Reference in this regard is invited to a
notification dated 28.7.2003 issued by the Excise Authorities on the  140 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 subject of charging of interest under section 11AB wherein
the excise authorities recognized prevailing commercial practice of
supplementary invoices being made in addition to the original invoices.
12.1. Placing reliance on the decision in assessee's own case decided in
favour by CIT (A) for AY 2003-04 and by ITAT for AY 2007- 08, and also the
decisions reported in Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd.: 37 ITR 1 (SC), Metal Box
India (P) Limited (1969): 73 ITR 53 (SC) , United Commercial Bank v. CIT 240
ITR 355 (SC), Bharat Earth Movers: 245 ITR 428 (SC) , CIT v Vinitec Corpn. (P)
Ltd.: 278 ITR 337 (Delhi), National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. v
JCIT: 98 ITD 278 (Hyd. ITAT), Ld. AR argued that that liability which has
arisen in the relevant accounting year is an allowable deduction even though
its actual quantification and discharge is deferred to a future date. In
respect of the vendor-wise and item-wise details of total provision of
Rs.32,11,63,153 made during the relevant year in the paper book, it is
submitted that the said details contain name of the vendor, the amount of
additional value in respect of the component, the invoices, raised by the
suppliers, were provisional and each invoice was liable to be reviewed/
amended once the quantum is determined and that this quantum of increase would
apply to re-compute the prices payable by assessee on all supplies made by the
suppliers during the year, and the liability for FPI was provided in the books
of accounts on a scientific analysis of increase in price of components due to
change in input cost, representing additional purchase price of the goods. It
is submitted that since the liability accrued during the relevant assessment
year, even though was finally paid in the following assessment years, the same
was allowable deduction.
141 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
12.2. Ld. AR placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of CIT vs Woodward Governor India (P) Ltd.: 312 ITR 254 wherein it is
held that:-
"21. In conclusion, we may state that in order to find out if an expenditure
is deductible the following have to be taken into account (i) whether the
system of accounting followed by the assessee is mercantile system, which
brings into debit the expenditure amount for which a legal liability has been
incurred before it is actually disbursed and brings into credit what is due,
immediately it becomes due and before it is actually received; (ii) whether
the same system is followed by the assessee from the very beginning and if
there was a change in the system, whether the change was bona fide; (iii)
whether the assessee has given the same treatment to losses claimed to have
accrued and to the gains that may accrue to it; (iv) whether the assessee has
been consistent and definite in making entries in the account books in respect
of losses and gains; (v) whether the method adopted by the assessee for making
entries in the books both in respect of losses and gains is as per nationally
accepted accounting standards; (vi) whether the system adopted by the assessee
is fair and reasonable or is adopted only with a view to reducing the
incidence of taxation." 12.3. Further reliance is also placed on the judgment
of the apex Court in the case of Rotork Controls India (P) Ltd. vs CIT: 314
ITR 62 wherein it has been held that:-
"17. At this stage, we once again reiterate that a liability is a present
obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to
result in an outflow of resources and in respect of which a reliable estimate
is possible of the amount of obligation."
12.4. Ld. AR submitted that this practice is in consonance with the provisions
of the Companies Act and generally accepted accounting principles and
practices of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and has been
regularly followed by assessee and claims were accordingly made which has been
duly accepted by Revenue in all the preceding years except in assessment year
AY 2003-04 and AY 2007-
08\. There has been no change in method of accounting or estimation. It is
submitted that this method of accounting regularly and consistently  142 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 followed does not lead to any loss of revenue, whatsoever and
the liability estimated in a particular year finally settled in the subsequent
year gets reflected in the profit & loss account, whereby the income as well
as the charge on settlement in the subsequent year is brought to the income or
expenses statement of the assessee company to the extent of variation from the
actual FPI liability. Ld. AR argued that it is well settled that mere timing
difference should not be used to disturb the method of accounting and books of
accounts of a tax payer consistently maintained and accepted year after year.
In support of his argument that while the principle of res judicata does not
apply to the income-tax proceedings, the Courts have emphasized there must be
consistency in the position that the Revenue takes on an issue in different
assessment years, Ld. AR cited the decisions reported in CIT vs. Excel
Industries (P) Limited: 358 ITR 295 (SC), Radhasoami Satsang v. CIT 193 ITR
321(SC), DIT (E) v. Apparel Export Promotion Council: 244 ITR 734 (Del), CIT
v. Neo Polypack (P) Ltd: 245 ITR 492 (Del.), CIT v. Girish Mohan Ganeriwala:
260 ITR 417 (P&H), CIT V. Dalmia Promoters Developers (P) Ltd: 200 CTR 426
(Del.), Escorts Cardiac Diseases Hospital: 300 ITR 75 (Del). Since the issue
now stands covered in favour of the assessee by the order of the Tribunal in
the assessee own case for the assessment year 2007-08, wherein the Tribunal
held that provision for foreseen price increase made by the appellant
represented an accrued/crystallized liability, which is an allowable business
deduction, Ld. AR submits that the addition on this account may be deleted.
12.5. Per contra, Ld. DR submitted that the decision of ITAT for AY 2007-08 is
not acceptable because the assessee's methodology is unique and no case law
applies to the modus operandi adopted by the  143 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
assessee. Further according to him Assessee's reliance on the case of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Radha Saomi Satsang v. CIT reported in 193 ITR
321 and, Berger Paints v. CIT reported in 266 ITR 199, is also misplaced
because in these cases Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the situation
where the liability was certain, but what was not certain was the quantum of
such liability. In the case of the assessee, the assessee has quantified the
liability without being sure of the liability and at the same time not
acknowledging the quantified liability to the creditors and not leaving any
note in the audit report. He placed reliance on the decisions reported in ITO
vs. EMCO Transformers Ltd. (ITAT, Bom) 32 1TD 260, Srinivasa Computers Ltd.
vs. ACIT (ITAT, Chennai) 107 1TD 357, and CIT vs. Rotork Controls India Ltd.
(Mad) 293 ITR 311. According to him, later on the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
laid down General Principle on this issue, wherein it was stated that the
value of contingent liability, like warranty expense, if properly ascertained
and discounted on accrual basis can be an item of deduction under section 37,
the principle of estimation is not the normal rule it would depend on the
nature of business, nature of sale, nature of product and scientific method of
accounting adopted by the assessee, and it would also depend upon the
historical trend and number of articles produced.
12.6. On a perusal of the order of the Tribunal for the AY 2007-08 on this
issue, we find that this issue covered by the ground Nos. 13 to 13.5 and by
noticing that similar disallowance was deleted by the first appellate
authority and revenue did not prefer any appeal thereon, and the Tribunal
observed as follows:
"26.5 Considering the above submissions, we find that similar disallowance was
made in the assessment year 2003-04 and the first appellate order had  144 ITA
No. 467/Del/2014 deleted the disallowance while deciding the issue in favour
of the assessee against which Revenue did not prefer any appeal before the
ITAT. Thereafter, only during the year under consideration, such disallowance
has been made. Of course, principles of res-judicata is not application in the
income- tax matters but rule of consistency is applicable as per which under
the similar facts and circumstances, department ought to follow same approach
on an issue in other assessment years. It is an established proposition of law
that a method of accounting regularly and consistently followed does not lead
to any loss of Revenue, whatsoever. The liability estimated in a particular
year finally settled in the subsequent year gets reflected in the profit and
loss account. We thus set aside the matter to the file of the Assessing
Officer with direction to decide the issue afresh after affording opportunity
of being heard to the assessee as per the first appellate order on the issue
in the assessment year 2003-04 against which no appeal was preferred by the
Revenue before the ITAT."
12.7. When a similar question was dealt with by the first appellate authority
and the Revenue accepted the same without preferring any appeal thereon, it is
not open for the Revenue now to contend that Assessee's reliance on the case
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Radha Saomi Satsang v. CIT reported in
193 ITR 321 and, Berger Paints v. CIT reported in 266 ITR 199, is also
misplaced because in these cases Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the
situation where the liability was certain, but what was not certain was the
quantum of such liability. There is no dispute that the same method of
accounting is regularly and consistently followed by the assessee as such rule
of consistency is applicable as per which under the similar facts and
circumstances, department ought to follow same approach on an issue in other
assessment years. We, therefore, respectfully following the reasoning adopted
by the coordinate Bench of this Tribinal for the AY 2007-08, set aside the
matter to the file of the Assessing Officer with direction to decide the issue
afresh after affording opportunity of being heard to the assessee as per the
first appellate order on the issue in the assessment year 2003-04, as followed
by this Tribunal for the AY 2007-08 also. Grounds 12 to 12.5  145 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 are disposed of accordingly."
Thus, the issue is identical in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2008-09.
Therefore, we are remanding back this issue to the file of the Assessing
Officer with direction to decide the issue afresh after giving opportunity of
hearing to the assessee. Hence Ground No. 9 to 9.5 are partly allowed for
statistical purpose.
71\. In result, Ground No. 9 to 9.5 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
72\. Ground No. 10 to 10.3 is relating to Sharing of resources with other
Group Companies/Subsidiary Companies amounting to Rs. 17,29,22,979/-. During
the financial year 2008-09, the subsidiary companies of the assessee were
operating as Corporate Insurance agents of different insurance companies. The
Ld. AR submitted that in an era of increasing competition and consumer
expectations, it was the endeavour of the assessee to provide maximum services
to its customers under one-roof to improve customer experience and delight
with company products. The company transformed it's dealerships to one-stop
shop for sale of its products and providing all related facilities of
financing, insurance, auto-card, purchase and sale of used cars, etc. All
these added facilities are integrally linked to the main business of the
assessee company to sell passenger cars and although the earnings from these
activities per se may not be very significant, the activities contribute
significantly in generating the demand for the products of the company. In
India, under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is mandatory
that every vehicle should have a valid Insurance to drive on the road. Any
vehicle used for social, domestic and pleasure purpose and for the insurer's
business motor purpose should be insured. Therefore, the car buyer needs to
have a valid insurance at the time of taking delivery itself from the
dealership to legally drive it on the road. Further, under the governing
insurance laws, it is not permissible for the company to obtain insurance
agency. Therefore, the group companies were promoted by the company with the
business exigency of  146 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 providing insurance services to
the customers of its vehicles. Providing insurance facility at the
dealership's shop serves, inter alia, the following advantages to the assessee
company:
(a) MSIL is able to provide one stop shop for the company's products, which
enables the company to not only promote sales but also face the ever
increasing competition from rival automobile companies;
b) MSIL is able to ensure mooth and timely delivery of the vehicles;
c) MSIL is able to provide smooth after sale services by taking care of post-
sales insurance needs of the customers
d) Promoting sale of spare parts and accessories
e) Promoting service incomes of the company and its dealers In view of the
significant contribution of the Insurance subsidiaries in promoting the
company's products, it is in the best interests of the assessee to ensure the
subsistence and smooth running of the Insurance subsidiaries. The simplistic
business structure of the Insurance Company required negligible administrative
and manpower support for its functioning, which has been provided by the
existing set-up of the MSIL. The assessee, it needs to be appreciated,
provided the support to the Insurance subsidiaries due to its business
exigency rather than supporting the said company. The sharing of
facilities/services by MSIL for its own business interests and accordingly,
the related cost is an allowable business expenditure for the company.
Further, it may kindly be appreciated that the expression "for the purpose of
business" as used in section 37(1) of the Act is much wider than "for the
purpose of earning income". What is, therefore, important for the purpose of
allowability of deduction under section 37(1) of the Act is that the
expenditure must be incurred for the purpose of business. It is not necessary
that incurring of expenditure must immediately result in receipt of income
and/or there must be substantial quantum of income. Therefore, if expenditure
is incurred for the purpose of business, such expenditure is an allowable
deduction, even though  147 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the same does not result in
earning of income immediately. The Ld. AR relied upon the decisions of the
Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs. Malayalam Plantations Ltd.: 53 ITR 140.
The apex Court reiterated the same approach in the following cases:
• CIT vs. Birla Cotton Spinning. & Weaving Mills Ltd.: 82 ITR 166 (SC) •
Madhav Prasad Jatia vs. CIT : 118 ITR 200 (SC) In the present case, sharing of
MSIL resources by group/ subsidiary companies providing insurance services was
only meant to promote the purpose of MSIL's business and hence the entire
expenditure incurred by the company was allowable as deduction. The Ld. AR
further submitted that since the entire expenditure as incurred by the
assessee wholly and exclusively for purposes of its business, any incidental/
indirect benefit to the group company(ies), it is settled law, cannot be the
basis for disallowing the expenditure in the hands of the assessee. The Ld. AR
further relied upon the decisions referred supra, some of which are as
follows:
• Sassoon J. David and Co. P. Ltd. vs. CIT : 118 ITR 261 (SC); • CIT v Nestle
India Ltd. 337 ITR ITR 103 (Del. HC) (affirmed by the Supreme Court) • CIT vs
Adidas India Marketing (P) Ltd: 195 Taxman 256 (Del) • CIT vs Agra Beverages
Corporation (P) Ltd: 200 Taxman 43 (Del. Mag.) (HC); • Sony India (P) Ltd vs.
Dy. CIT : 315 ITR 150 (Del ITAT) • Star India (P) Ltd.: 103 ITD 73 TM (Mum.)
In view of the aforesaid, the Ld. AR that the assessing officer erred in
disallowing Rs. 17,29,22,979/- in the impugned assessment order, which calls
for being deleted in toto. Without prejudice to submission above, the Ld. AR
submitted that even if the company were to recover the cost of charges
provided to the Insurance subsidiaries, it shall be a very small amount
compared to what has been considered by the AO in the impugned assessment  148
ITA No. 467/Del/2014 order. The annual cost of services/facilities provided to
the different Insurance companies has been estimated at Rs.1.54 Crores as
below:
            Head                                     Approx. Cost (Rs.)
            Salaries of Employees                    1,12,75,000/-
            Travelling Cost                          10,00,000/-
            Office Infrastructure Cost               9,46,800
            IT System/Application Cost               22,00,000
            Total Cost                               1,54,21,800/-
That apart, and without prejudice to the above, the Ld. AR further submitted
that it is disputed the aforesaid business expenditure, being will have to be
allowed as deduction under section 37(1) of the Act, either in the hands of
the assessee company or to the group Companies. Therefore, on an overall
basis, the entire exercise of seeking to tax the normal business expenditure
is, in any case, revenue neutral. Accordingly, even on this ground, deduction
in respect of such business expenditure should be allowed under section 37(1)
of the Act. The Ld. AR relied upon the following decisions wherein it has been
held that Revenue should agitate issues or make adjustment on issues which are
revenue neutral and do not affect overall taxes likely to be collected by the
Government.
• CIT v. Excel Industries Ltd and Mafatlal Industries (P) Ltd.: 358 ITR 295
(SC) • CIT v. Bilahari Investment P. Ltd.: 299 ITR 1 (SC) • CIT v. Shri Ram
Pistons & Rings Ltd.: 220 CTR 404 (Del.) • CIT v. Triveni Engg. & Industries
Ltd.: 336 ITR 374 (Del.) • CIT v. Nagri Mills Co. Ltd.: 33 ITR 681 (Bom.) •
CIT vs. M/s Vishnu Industrial Gases: ITA No. 229/1988 (Del.) In view of the
aforesaid, the Ld. AR submitted that the assessing officer may be directed to
delete the arbitrary disallowance based on an adhoc percentage of the turnover
made in the impugned assessment order. The aforesaid issue now  149 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 stands covered in favour of the assessee by the order of the
Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY 2008-09.
73\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
74\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. We find, the Tribunal in Assessee's own case for
A.Y.2008- 09 has held as under:
"Grounds No 14 to 14.4 Sharing of resources with other Group Companies/
Subsidiary Companies
14\. Succinctly stated facts relating to this ground are that during FY
2007-08, the subsidiary companies of MSIL were operating as Corporate
Insurance agents of different Insurance companies, and in an era of increasing
competition and consumer expectations, it was the endeavour of MSIL to provide
maximum services to its customers under one-roof to improve customer
experience and delight with company products. The company transformed it's
dealerships to one-stop shop for sale of its products and providing all
related facilities of financing, insurance, auto-card, purchase and sale of
used cars, etc. Assessee submits that all these added facilities are
integrally linked to the main business of the company to sell passenger cars
and although the earnings from these activities per-se may not be very
significant, the activities contribute significantly in generating the demand
for the products of the company. Looking at this, the assessing officer made
an ad-hoc disallowance of Rs.12,87,88,243 in the final assessment order
holding the same to be relatable to/ towards sharing of appellant's resources
with other group companies and  150 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 14.1. Ld. AR
submitted that in view of the stringent provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, it is mandatory that every vehicle should have a valid Insurance to
drive on the road at the time of taking delivery itself from the dealership
and under the governing insurance laws, it is not permissible for the company
to obtain insurance agency, necessitating the assessee to promote the group
companies. According to him this promotes the assessee to provide one stop
shop for the company's products, which enables the company to not only promote
sales but also face the ever increasing competition from rival automobile
companies; to ensure smooth and timely delivery of the vehicles; to provide
smooth after sale services by taking care of post-sales insurance needs of the
customers; sale of spare parts and accessories; and service incomes of the
company and its dealers. He further submitted that the simplistic business
structure of the Insurance Company required negligible administrative and
manpower support for its functioning, which has been provided by the existing
set-up of MSIL. Since the assessee provided the support to the Insurance
subsidiaries due to its business exigency the related cost is allowable
business expenditure for the company, in view of the fact that the expression
"for the purpose of business" as used in section 37(1) of the Act is much
wider than "for the purpose of earning income".
14.2. He relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of CIT vs.
Malayalam Plantations Ltd.:53 ITR 140, wherein it was held, that " the
expression " for the purpose of the business " is wider in scope than the
expression " for the purpose of earning profits ". Its range is wide : it may
take in not only the day to day running of a business but also the
rationalization of its administration and modernization of its machinery; it
may include measures for the preservation of the business and for the
protection of its assets and property  151 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 from
expropriation, coercive process or assertion of hostile title ; it may also
comprehend payment of statutory dues and taxes imposed as a pre-condition to
commence or for carrying on of a business ; it may comprehend many other acts
incidental to the carrying on of a business. However wide the meaning of the
expression may be, its limits are implicit in it. The purpose shall be for the
purpose of the business, that is to say, the expenditure incurred shall be for
the carrying on of the business and the assessee shall incur it in his
capacity as a person carrying on the business. It cannot include sums spent by
the assessee as agent of a third party, whether the origin of the agency is
voluntary or statutory; in that event, he pays the amount on behalf of another
and for a purpose unconnected with the business" (emphasis supplied) 14.3. He
submitted that the said approach is reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
CIT vs. Birla Cotton Spinning. & Weaving Mills Ltd.: 82 ITR 166 (SC) and
Madhav Prasad Jatia vs. CIT : 118 ITR 200 (SC) also.
14.4. By placing reliance on the decisions in Sassoon J. David and Co. P. Ltd.
vs. CIT : 118 ITR 261 (SC); , CIT v Nestle India Ltd. 337 ITR ITR 103 (Del.
HC) (affirmed by the Supreme Court), CIT vs Adidas India Marketing (P) Ltd:
195 Taxman 256 (Del), CIT vs Agra Beverages Corporation (P) Ltd: 200 Taxman 43
(Del. Mag.) (HC); , Sony India (P) Ltd vs. Dy. CIT : 315 ITR 150 (Del ITAT),
Star India (P) Ltd.: 103 ITD 73 TM (Mum.) he argued that since the entire
expenditure as incurred by the assessee wholly and exclusively for purposes of
its business, any incidental/ indirect benefit to the group company(ies), it
is settled law, cannot be the basis for disallowing the expenditure in the
hands of the assessee.
14.5. As a matter of fact, Ld. AR submitted that even if the company were to
recover the cost of charges provided to the Insurance subsidiaries, it shall
be a very small amount compared to what has been considered by the AO in the
impugned assessment order.
152 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Assessee estimated the annual cost of services/facilities provided to the
different Insurance companies at Rs.1.31 Crores as below:
    Salaries of Employees                       10,250,000
    Travelling Cost                                918,000
    Office Infrastructure Cost                           946,800
    IT System/ Application cost                    985,000
    Total Cost                                       13,099,800
14.6. He further submitted that the said expenditure being the business
expenditure, will have to be allowed as deduction under section 37(1) of the
Act, either in the hands of the appellant company or to the group companies,
in that sense the entire exercise of seeking to tax the normal business
expenditure is, in any case, revenue neutral as such in view of the decisions
in CIT v. Excel Industries Ltd and Mafatlal Industries (P) Ltd.: 358 ITR 295
(SC), CIT v. Bilahari Investment P. Ltd.: 299 ITR 1 (SC), CIT v. Shri Ram
Pistons & Rings Ltd.: 220 CTR 404 (Del.), CIT v. Triveni Engg. & Industries
Ltd.: 336 ITR 374 (Del.), CIT v. Nagri Mills Co. Ltd.: 33 ITR 681 (Bom.), and
CIT vs. M/s Vishnu Industrial Gases: ITA No. 229/1988 (Del.) Revenue should
not agitate issues or make adjustment on issues which are revenue neutral and
do not affect overall taxes likely to be collected by the Government. Ld. DR
vehemently relied upon the orders of the authorities below.
14.7. On a careful reading of the record in the light of the above arguments
of the Ld. Counsel, we find that there is no material that is brought on
record to controvert the plea of the assessee that they have provided the
support to the Insurance subsidiaries due to its business exigency rather than
supporting the said companies and it is it is in the best interests of MSIL to
do so for maximizing their profits, as such the  153 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
related cost is allowable business expenditure for the company. It also
further goes undisputed that this being the business expenditure will have to
be allowed as deduction under section 37(1) of the Act, either in the hands of
the appellant company or to the group companies. In these circumstances, while
respectfully following the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court and the
jurisdictional High Court, we find that the addition on this score cannot be
sustained. Accordingly, while along ground Nos 14 to 14.4, we direct the Ld.
AO to delete the same."
The issue is identical with the A.Y. 2008-09 decided by the Tribunal.
Therefore it will be appropriate to remand back this issue to the file of the
Assessing Officer and we direct the Assessing Officer to delete the
disallowance based on an adhoc percentage of the turnover made in the
assessment order in light of the decision of the Tribunal. Needless to say the
assessee be given opportunity of hearing by following principles of natural
justice. Hence Ground No. 10 to 10.3 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
75\. In result, Ground Nos. 10 to 10.3 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
76\. Ground No. 11 to 11.2 is relating to disallowance of expenditure incurred
on Corporate Social Responsibility amounting to Rs. 7,67,00,000/-. The Ld. AR
submitted that during the relevant assessment year, the assessee incurred
Rs.7,67,00,000/- on Corporate Social Responsibility ('CSR') activities which
was claimed as a business deduction under the Act. The Ld. AR submitted that
CSR refers to the obligations of businessmen to pursue those policies to make
those decisions or to follow those lines of relations which are desirable in
terms of the objectives and values of our society. An expense incurred merely
for discharging corporate social responsibility is also an expenditure
incurred to achieve long-term growth, create goodwill and secure a sustainable
competitive advantage. The said expenditure has been incurred for business
purposes on  154 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the grounds of commercial expediency and
for long term sustainability and there is no element of any personal benefit
being granted. The expenditure was incurred by the company wholly and
exclusively for the purpose of promoting its business and, therefore, the
expenditure is allowable. On the contrary, the assessing officer disallowed
the claim of the assessee on the ground that the same had not been incurred
wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business. In addition, the
assessing officer also alleged that the expenditure incurred by the assessing
officer resulted in an enduring benefit to the assessee and therefore was
capital in nature. In this regard, it is respectfully submitted that the
assessee, since 28 years is committed to the principle of "Give" - a principle
that has been the bedrock of the company's approach to sustainable business.
The assessee company has formulated a corporate social responsibility policy
recognizing its responsibility towards all its stakeholders. The key
stakeholders of the assessee company are its employees and their families,
customers and their families, shareholders and investors, dealers, suppliers
and other business partners, local community and society and environment and
regulatory authorities. The assessee company follows a partnership approach
with its various stakeholders, and believes that the prosperity and wellbeing
of the stakeholders will fuel the growth of the company in the future. During
the relevant assessment year, the assessee company had incurred Rs.76.70
millions towards CSR activities in the following areas:
(a) Maintenance of Children's Park near India Gate, New Delhi. This children's
park spread over 10 acres area has been developed to give clean, green and
safe playgrounds where children can have fun together even as they learn and
grow. The Park prominently displavs the banner of the assessee company at
various places within the park including the entrance gates and the ticket
counters. Further, the company's initiative in the taking over and developing
the children's park has hogged limelight through publicity in the print and
social media. It is pertinent to note that the assessee company cannot be said
155 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 to be merely carrying out philanthropic objects,
rather the contributions are indirectly aimed for promoting business of the
assessee company and also for advertising its name.
(b) National Road Safety Mission, as a mark of gratitude to the people of the
country, on the occasion of completing 25 years of successful operations, the
company launched a National Road Safety Mission to promote a culture of safe
and accident free driving on Indian roads. Even during the slow down period
year like F.Y. 08-09, the management devoted time and resources to start a
national road safety program to promote consciousness for safe driving in the
country. It is pertinent to note that the aforesaid is not in principle a
range of additional activities that the company adopts; rather it is a way of
carrying out the core activity which recognizes the company's responsibility
towards society as part of the business environment. It thus follows, that CSR
considerations are integrated into the company's business strategy and core
processes.
(c) Community Development and Employee Volunteering as the company considers
local community its important stakeholder. The CSR team along with the NGO
partner works with the community identifies their needs and does social
projects accordingly. These community initiatives have helped in developing a
cohesive relationship between the community and the company. The company has
adopted 4 villages around Manesar manufacturing plant for overall development
of these villages and for the well-being of people living in these villages.
The assessee company has been strengthening its own operations by gaining the
co-operation of the local community and its employees. Further, the company
endeavours to educate its employees and workers in order to develop an
effective two-way communication to educate workers as to what is in their best
interests. Sometimes a company's policies are also very one-sided. Workers,
usually receive politically motivated communications from outside persons, who
have no stake in the future of the company, and who are looking for short-term
political gains. The management  156 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 needs to counter
this by developing an education process so as to develop a long term sustained
growth for its business. Moreover CSR is an efficient instrument of how to
bind the workers to the company. This would also include good working
conditions which directly have a positive impact on the profit making strategy
of the company.
(d) ITI Project for which the government has identified upgradation of ITIs in
the country to meet the future requirement of skilled manpower as per industry
requirements. In order to support this initiative, the company has adopted 4
ITIs in Haryana in association with two of its suppliers in public private
partnership mode to develop them as centre of excellence. Unemployed educated
youth are identified from these villages and given vocational trainings at ITI
Gurgaon and Maruti driving school, Gurgaon. The company also facilitates their
employment. It is also felt by the company that this provides a positive
psychological impact on the minds of the functionaries of the company. It will
be appreciated that whenever aforesaid CSR activities are undertaken by the
company, the same is covered by print and electronic media. The expenditures
incurred by the assessee in such identified causes, thus, creates goodwill and
brand image for the assessee and helps in promoting business interests in long
run. Such expenditure creates a positive all-round brand image, which leaves
impact on the mind of everyone and ultimately attracts customers to the
products and services offered by the company. Following all laws and caring
for the environment makes good business sense, and helps in image building.
The assessee company is undertaking the aforesaid CSR activities which would
cumulatively maximize the probability of its long-term survival and sustained
growth. Considered in the light of the aforesaid background, the Ld. AR
submitted, that the CSR expenditure is allowable as a business deduction under
the provisions of the Income Tax Act ('the Act"). In this regard, the Ld. AR
pointed out to provisions of section 37(1) of the Act, and submitted that
under section 37(1) of the Act the fundamental condition for allowability is
that the expenditure must be incurred "for the purpose of  157 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 business". The said expression is, much wider than "for the
purpose of earning income". For any expenditure to be eligible for deduction,
such expenditure must be incurred for the purposes of business, irrespective
of fact whether incurring of such expenditure is voluntarily and without any
compelling necessity or mandatory. It is, in this regard, also relevant to
refer to the legislative history of section 37(1) of the Act, wherein the
Income Tax Bill of 1961 initially proposed to lay down that "necessity" of the
expenditure would be a condition for claiming deduction under that section.
The implication of the aforesaid is that the fact that somebody other than the
assessee is also benefitted by the incurring of the expenditure does not come
in the way of the expenditure being allowed by way of deduction under section
37(1) of the Act. What is important for the purpose of allowability of
deduction under section 37(1) of the Act is that the expenditure must be
incurred for the purpose of business. Again, the words, "for the purpose of
business" should not be limited to the meaning of "earning profit alone". It
is also important to note that the purpose has to be seen from the point of
view of the businessman and should not be seen with reference to narrow
objective of earning profits immediately. To elaborate, certain expenditure
may not reap profits immediately, but may be advantageous in the long run, by
creating goodwill and brand image. The Ld. AR further submitted that CSR
expenses are allowable as revenue expenditure, as has been held in the
following decisions:
> i) Sri Venkata Satyanarayana Rice Mill Contractors Co v. CIT: 223 ITR 101
> ii) CIT v. Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. : ITA No.743 of 2008
> iii) CIT v. Madras Refineries Ltd.: 266 ITR 170 (Mad.)
> iv) CIT v. Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd.: 281 ITR 408 (Raj.),
> The Rajasthan High Court, while relying on its decision in the assessee's
> own case reported at 274 ITR 465 decided the issue in favour of the
> assessee.
v) The Bombay High Court in the case of Krishna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd
v. CIT: 229 ITR 577 held that contribution to the education fund under the
Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 was allowable as  158 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 revenue expenditure. The Chennai High Court in the case of CIT v.
Chennai Petroleum Corpn. Ltd: T.C.(A).No.57 of 2006, held that social and
welfare community expenses are deductible as business expenditure. The Gujarat
High Court in the case of CIT vs Jayendrakumar Hiralal: 327 ITR 147. The
Karnataka High Court in the case of Mysore Kirloskar v. CIT: 166 ITR 836, held
that the contribution made for common treatment of effluents was allowable
business expenditure under section 37(1) observed that the expenditure
incurred on account of donations to certain funds, charitable institutions,
etc. is allowable even if the donation has no nexus with the business of the
assessee and regardless of any business activity or any commercial expediency.
The money may be expended on grounds of commercial expediency but not of
necessity and still would be allowable as a business deduction. The Karnataka
High Court in the case of CIT vs. Karnataka Financial Corporation: 326 ITR 355
held that expenditure incurred in setting up "model villages" at the instance
of the government is allowable as deduction. In the case of Infosys
Technologies Ltd. v. JCIT: 109 TTJ 631 (Bang.), the assessee incurred
installed traffic signals at Bannerghatta Circle where the office of assessee
was situated as there used to be traffic jams resulting in delay to employees
in reaching the office. The same was handed over to the Government after
installation. The Tribunal held that incurrence of such expenditure was
prompted solely with a view to benefit its employees. It was observed that the
expenditure being incurred in the character as a trader and was prompted by
commercial expediency would be allowable as deduction. The Ld. AR also relied
upon the decision of Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Hindustan
Petroleum Corp. Ltd. v. DCIT: 96 ITD 186. In the instant case, the assessee, a
company owned by Government of India and working under its control and
directions, incurred some expenditure towards implementation of 20- Point
Programme at instance of Government and claimed deduction of same under
section 37(1) of the Act. The Tribunal observed that it was in business
interest of assessee to abide by directions of Government of India which owned
assessee and expenditure on 20- Point Programme was incurred in view of
specific directions  159 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 of Government of India and
allowable under section 37(1) of the Act. Attention is also invited to the
decision of the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Indian Petroleums vs.
Department of Income Tax: ITA No. 664 and 665/ Ahd/2008, wherein the Court
held that the assessee is entitled to the deduction of expenditure incurred in
the nature of donation / contribution towards community development work. The
Ld. AR relied upon the decision of the Ahmedabad bench of the Tribunal in the
case of Lubrizol Advances Materials India P. Ltd. v. DCIT: 150 ITD 538. The
Ld. AR also relied upon the following cases:
i) IAC v. Nuchem Plastics Ltd.: 35 TTJ 559 (Del.)
ii) DCIT v. Hero Moto Corp. Ltd. : ITA No.l609/Del/2016 (Del. Trib.)
iii) CIT v. D.T.T.D.C Ltd.: 350 ITR 1 (Del)
iv) Delhi Cloth and General Mills Company Ltd. v. ITO: ITA No. 5289/Del./74-75
v) Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.: ITA No.: 3925/D/02 (Del.-ITAT)
vi) JCIT v. Deversons Industries Ltd. 290 ITR (AT) 287 (Ahd) The Ld. AR also
pointed out that Explanation 2 has been inserted in section 37 of the Act by
the Finance (No.2) Act, 2014 w.e.f. 1.04.2015 to provide that CSR expenses
referred in section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall not be deemed to be
incurred for the purpose of business. The aforesaid Explanation inserted
w.e.f. 1.04.2015, the Ld. AR submitted that the same also fortifies the claim
of the assessee that prior to assessment year 2015-16, even CSR expenditure
was an allowable business deduction. In view of the above catena of judicial
pronouncements, the Ld. AR submitted that, CSR expenses are expenditure
incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business and are hence
allowable as a revenue deduction.
77\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of the Assessing Officer.
78\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. It is pertinent to note that the Ld. AR submitted before
us that the CSR expenditure is allowable as a business deduction under the
160 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 provisions of the Income Tax Act ('the Act"). In this
regard, the Ld. AR pointed out to provisions of section 37(1) of the Act, and
submitted that under section 37(1) of the Act the fundamental condition for
allowability is that the expenditure must be incurred "for the purpose of
business". The said expression is, much wider than "for the purpose of earning
income". For any expenditure to be eligible for deduction, such expenditure
must be incurred for the purposes of business, irrespective of fact whether
incurring of such expenditure is voluntarily and without any compelling
necessity or mandatory. It is, in this regard, also relevant to refer to the
legislative history of section 37(1) of the Act, wherein the Income Tax Bill
of 1961 initially proposed to lay down that "necessity" of the expenditure
would be a condition for claiming deduction under that section. The
implication of the aforesaid is that the fact that somebody other than the
assessee is also benefitted by the incurring of the expenditure does not come
in the way of the expenditure being allowed by way of deduction under section
37(1) of the Act. What is important for the purpose of allowability of
deduction under section 37(1) of the Act is that the expenditure must be
incurred for the purpose of business. Again, the words, "for the purpose of
business" should not be limited to the meaning of "earning profit alone". It
is also important to note that the purpose has to be seen from the point of
view of the businessman and should not be seen with reference to narrow
objective of earning profits immediately. Certain expenditure may not reap
profits immediately, but may be advantageous in the long run, by creating
goodwill and brand image. These submissions of the Ld. AR are supported by the
Income Tax statute. But at the same time, it can be seen that Explanation 2
has been inserted in section 37 of the Act by the Finance (No.2) Act, 2014
w.e.f. 1.04.2015 to provide that CSR expenses referred in section 135 of the
Companies Act, 2013 shall not be deemed to be incurred for the purpose of
business. The aforesaid Explanation inserted w.e.f. 1.04.2015. Therefore, in
the present assessment year the said explanation will not be applicable.
Hence, the expenditure has to be allowed because ultimately the assessee was
publicizing its product at the prominent places by maintaining them such as
parks and  161 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 this has direct impact on the sales
promotions of the assessee company. Therefore, Ground No. 11 to 11.12 are
allowed.
79\. In result, Ground No. 11 to 11.2 are allowed.
80\. Ground No. 12 is relating to disallowance of club expenditure amounting
to Rs. 6,41,060. The Ld. AR submitted that the assessee company has debited
Rs.6,41,060/- on account of club membership fees to profit & loss account. The
said expenditure is incurred on subscription to clubs provided to various
employees and directors. The Assessing Officer has, in the impugned assessment
order disallowed the said expenditure of Rs.6,41,060/- by holding that the
same cannot be considered as business expenditure. At the outset, the Ld. AR
submitted that the aforesaid expenditure has been incurred for business
purposes on the grounds of commercial expediency and there is no element of
any personal benefit being granted either to the employee or director. The Tax
Auditors have amply clarified this position vide clause 17(b) of the Tax Audit
Report. The aforesaid expenditure is, thus, allowable as deduction. The
aforesaid issue is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Samtel Color Ltd (Civil appeal No 6449/2012) wherein the Court dismissed the
SLP filed by Revenue against the order of Dr Delhi High Court (referred infra)
allowing the claim for deduction representing 6 expenditure incurred on club
membership. The Ld. AR relied upon the following judicial pronouncements:
• Nestle India Limited: 296 ITR 682 (Del.) • CIT v. Samtel Color Ltd.: 326 ITR
425 (Del.) - SLP filed by the Revenue dismissed in C.A No.6449/2012 • Otis
Elevators Co. (India) Ltd v. CIT 195 ITR 682 (Bom) • CIT v. Citibank N.A.: 264
ITR 18 (Bom) • CIT v. Force Motors Ltd.: ITA No. 5296 of 2010 (Bom) • CIT v.
Sundaram Industries Ltd 240 ITR 335 (Mad) • Gujarat State Export Corporation
Ltd. v. CIT: 209 ITR 649 (Guj.) • CIT v. Infosys Technologies Ltd.: 205 Taxman
59 (Kar)  162 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 • Assam Brook Ltd. v CIT: 267 ITR 121 (Cal)
• DCIT v. Max India Ltd (2007) 112 TTJ (Asr.) 726 (Bom);
• American Express International Banking Corporation v CIT 258 ITR 601.
The Ld. AR further submitted that the aforesaid issue is also covered in
favour of the assessee by the decisions of the Tribunal in the assessee's own
case for the assessment years 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-O5, 2005-06, 2006-07,
2007-08 and 2008-09.
81\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
82\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. It is pertinent to note that in assessee's own case for
A.Ys. 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-O5, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09, the
Tribunal decided this issue in favour of the assessee. The Tribunal held as
under:
"8. On the aspect of disallowance of Rs.10,06,470/- expenditure incurred on
club membership, case of the assessee is that the assessee company has debited
Rs.10,06,470/- to profit & loss account, the expenditure was incurred on
subscription to clubs provided to various employees and directors on account
of club membership fees and the assessing officer has, in the impugned
assessment order disallowed the said expenditure of Rs.10,06,470/- by holding
that the same cannot be considered as business expenditure. Ld. AR argued that
this expenditure has been incurred for business purposes on the grounds of
commercial expediency and there is no element of any personal benefit being
granted either to the employee or director and the Tax Auditors have amply
clarified this position vide clause 17(b) of the Tax Audit Report. Basing on
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Samtel Color Ltd. (Civil
appeal no. 6449/2012) by way of which the Hon'ble Apex Court dismissed the SLP
filed by Revenue against the order of Delhi High Court in CIT v. Samtel Color
Ltd.: 326 ITR 425 (Del.) allowing the  163 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 claim for
deduction representing expenditure incurred on club membership, he argued that
this expenditure is allowable as deduction. He submitted that besides being
covered by the decisions in Nestle India Limited: 296 ITR 682 (Del.), CIT v.
Samtel Color Ltd.: 326 ITR 425 (Del.), Otis Elevators Co. (India) Ltd. v. CIT
195 ITR 682 (Bom); American Express International Banking Corporation v. CIT
258 ITR 601 (Bom.); CIT v. Citibank N.A.:264 ITR 18 (Bom), CIT v. Force Motors
Ltd.:ITA No. 5296 of 2010 (Bom), CIT v. Sundharam Industries Ltd. 240 ITR 649
(Guj.), CIT v. Infosys Technologies Ltd.: 205 Taxman 59 (Kar), Assam Brook
Ltd. v. CIT: 267 ITR 121 (Cal), DCIT v Max India Ltd. (2007) 112 TTJ
(Asr.)726, this issue is also covered in favour of the assessee by the
decisions of the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the assessment years
2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-
08\. 8.1 On this aspect, the Ld. DR submitted that in view of the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court cited above, the decision of the ITAT was accepted and
further appeal before the Hon'ble High Court u/s 260A was not preferred on
this issue for AY 2006-07 and 2007-08. In view of this submission of Ld. DR
this ground is allowed and the Assessing Officer is directed to allow a sum of
Rs. 10,06,470/- being expenditure incurred on account of club membership
fees."
Thus, this issue is squarely covered by the decision of the Tribunal in
assessee's own case. Hence Ground No. 12 is allowed.
83\. In result, Ground No. 12 is allowed.
84\. Ground Nos. 13 and 15 to 15.28 is relating to adjustment on account of
excessive AMP expenses. The Ld. AR submitted that pursuant to order passed by
the TPO under Section 154 of the Act, the transfer pricing adjustment made on
account of AMP expenses was deleted. The Ld. DR did not dispute the said
position.
164 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
85\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. Pursuance to order passed by the TPO u/s 154 of the Act,
the transfer pricing adjustment made on account of AMP expenses was deleted.
Therefore, these grounds become infructuous. Ground No. 13 and 15 to 15.28 are
dismissed.
86\. Ground Nos. 16 to 16.14 is relating to adjustment on account of payment
of royalty for use of brand name for Rs. 311.75 crores. The Ld. AR submitted
that this issue is covered by the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own
case for A.Y. 2005-06 (ITA No.5237/Del/2011), A.Y. 2006-07 (ITA
No.5120/Del/2010), A.Y. 2007-08 (ITA No.5720/Del/2011), and A.Y. 2008-09 (ITA
No.6021/Del/2012). The Ld. AR submitted that during the relevant previous year
the assessee inter alia entered into the transaction of payment of royalty of
Rs. 677.68 crore to Suzuki Motor Corporation (AE) in consideration for the
right to manufacture and sell various models of motor cars. TNMM was applied
to benchmark the aforesaid transaction of payment of royalty and OP/Sales was
considered as the profit level indicator. Since the operating profit margin
(OP/Sales) of the assessee at 6.85% was higher than the average of the
operating profit ratio of comparable companies, at 6.56% the international
transactions entered into by the assessee were considered as having been
entered at arm's length price, applying TNMM. The TPO, however, disregarded
the benchmarking analysis undertaken by the assessee and held that:
(i) The international transaction of payment of royalty does not satisfy the
arm's length principle
(ii) held that the assessee was not justified in paying any royalty to SMC
towards use of SMC's trademark;
165 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
(iii) allocated the royalty paid by the assessee in the ratio of R&D and AMP
expenses incurred by the associated enterprise. The TPO accordingly held that
46% of the total royalty paid by the assessee is towards use of trademark.
The TPO accordingly made an adjustment of Rs. 311.73 crores being 48% of the
total royalty paid by the assessee. In this regard, the Ld. AR submitted that
the Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y. 2005-06 (ITA No. 5237/Del/2011)
and for A.Y. 2006-07 (ITA No. 5120/Del/2010) deleted similar adjustment on
account of payment of Brand royalty. Following the order for A.Y. 2006-07, the
Tribunal directed for the deletion of transfer pricing adjustment on account
of payment of royalty in A.Y. 2007-08 (ITA No. 5270/Del/2011). Similarly, the
Tribunal for A.Y. 2008-09 (ITA No. 6020/Del/2012) deleted the adjustment on
account of royalty made by the TPO. Similarly in the case of Goodyear India
Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA No. 5650/Del/2011) held that payment of royalty cannot be
disallowed arbitrarily on the basis that a brand is weak. The Ld. AR submitted
that following the findings of the Co-ordinate benches in the preceding year,
similar Transfer Pricing adjustment on account of brand royalty, amounting to
Rs. 311.73 crores calls for being deleted.
87\. The Ld. DR relied upon the order of the TPO/AO.
88\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. The Tribunal held that there is a direct nexus between
the revenue of the taxpayer and the payment of royalty and the Revenue cannot
challenge or dispute the benefit derived by the taxpayer from payment of such
royalty. The Tribunal while deleting the adjustment made by the TPO held as
under:
> "12. Another contention of the TPO that the Goodyear Brand was weak and
> therefore does not require payment of royalty, is not brought out from the
> records. The AR of the assessee has made elaborate submission and placed
> evidence on record to show that 'Goodyear' brand is considered to be one of
> the top most acclaimed brand across the globe. Therefore, there is no merit
> in  166 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 the allegation of the TPO that Goodyear brand
> has no worth and therefore, the payment made by the assessee for use of
> Goodyear brand is unwarranted.
........
16\. In light of the above, we conclude that there exists a direct nexus
between the revenue earned by the assessee and the payment of royalty made to
the associated enterprise for using brand name, and therefore, it would be
incorrect to analyze the transaction of payment of royalty in isolation.
Further the Ld. DR had raised a contention that the assessee has not
demonstrated how the payment for royalty beneficial to the taxpayer. We are of
the opinion that, ascertaining whether a service has actually benefitted the
assessee is not within the prerogative of the tax authorities."
Thus, the issue is identical with the earlier assessment year and in the
present year as well, there is a direct nexus between the revenue of the
taxpayer and the payment of royalty. Therefore, the Revenue cannot dispute the
benefit derived by the taxpayer from payment of such royalty. Hence Ground No.
16 to 16.14 are allowed.
89\. In result, Ground No. 16 to 16.14 are allowed.
90\. Ground No. 17 is general in nature, hence dismissed.
91\. Ground No. 18 is relating to not allowing credit of TDS Certificates. The
Ld. AR submitted that the Assessing Officer be directed to allow credit of
additional TDS certificates received amounting to Rs.3,28,12,444.
92\. The Ld. DR did not object the same.
93\. We have heard both the parties and perused the records. The Assessee has
submitted the TDS certificates which has to be considered by the Assessing
Officer. Therefore, we restore this issue to the file of the Assessing Officer
and direct the Assessing Officer to verify the additional TDS certificates
produced by the Assessee and thereafter allow the credit of the same. Needless
to say, the assessee be given the opportunity of the hearing by following the
167 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 principles of the natural justice. Hence, Ground No.
18 is partly allowed for statistical purpose.
94\. In result, Ground No. 18 is partly allowed for statistical purpose.
95\. As relating to Ground No. 19 to 19.1, the same is regarding error in
computation of interest u/s 234B of the Act. The Assessing Officer has
computed interest under section 234B of the Act by firstly computing on the
assessed income upto the date of payment of first self assessment tax prior to
filing the original return. After computing interest as aforesaid, self
assessment tax paid by the assessee is first adjusted against the interest
calculated as aforesaid. As against the aforesaid, according to the Ld. AR,
the Assessing Officer erred in first adjusting the self assessment tax against
the interest leviable under section 234B of the Act calculated on the basis of
assessed income. The Ld. AR submitted that such adjustment, under section 140A
of the Act is permissible only with reference to interest computed with
reference to the returned income and not with reference of the assessed
income. The method of computation used by the Assessing Officer is contrary to
the method prescribed in CBDT Circular No.549 dated 31.10.1989: 182 ITR (St.)
40, which is binding on the Income Tax Department. The Ld. AR relied upon the
decision of the Ahmedabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Patson
Transformers Ltd. v. DCIT: 103 TTJ 735 wherein the Tribunal was considering
the similar issue regarding the calculation of interest under section 234B in
the light of the Explanation to section 140A of the Act and decided the issue
in favour of assessee. The Ld. AR relied upon the decision of the Mumbai Bench
of the Tribunal in the case of ACIT v. C.C Chokshi and Co.: ITA No.
7791/Mum/2004 wherein the Tribunal was adjudicating similar issue. In that
case, the assessing officer similarly adjusted the self assessment tax firstly
against the interest leviable under section 234B of the Act on the basis of
the assessed income. On the other hand, the assessee contended that the same
needs to be computed with reference to the returned income and not the
assessed income.
168 ITA No. 467/Del/2014
Accepting the contention of the assessee, the Tribunal observed in C.C Chokshi
and Co (supra) as under:
"3.6.2 We have heard both parties perused the records and considered the
matter carefully. The factual and legal background relating to the issue has
already been discussed in the preceding paras. The section 140A provides that
in case payment made under the said section falls short of the tax payable
including interest under the said section then the tax so paid shall be first
attributed towards the interest and the balance amount shall be adjusted
against the tax payable. In this case, the tax payable under section 140A also
included interest payable under section 234B. The issue is whether the
interest payable under section 234B which has to be first adjusted against the
payment u/s 140A has to be calculated with respect to total income as declared
in the return or total income determined in the regular assessment.
We find that the section 140(1B) provides that interest payable under section
234B, has to be computed on the amount by which the advance paid falls short
of assessed tax and the assessed tax for the purpose of this sub-section has
been defined in the Explanation to mean the tax on total income as declared in
the return as reduced by tax deducted/collected at source etc. Therefore, we
agree with the submission made by Id. A.R that the interest payable under
section 234 B for the purpose of adjustment against the tax paid under section
140A has to be computed with respect to assessed tax determined on the basis
of total income declared in the return. But this is only for the limited
purpose of adiustment of payment made u/s. 140A against interest payable under
section 234B while making computation of interest payable by the assessee
under section 234B which has to be computed with respect to the total income
determined in regular assessment as per the definition of assessed tax given
in section 234B. The assessee has also followed the same procedure with which
we agree. The order of CIT(A)  169 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 confirming the method
followed by the AO is therefore set aside and the claim of the assessee is
allowed. "
The aforesaid issue is now covered in favour of the assessee by the Delhi
Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 and 2008-09. The
Assessing Officer should, therefore, be directed to recompute interest under
section 234B of the Act, as aforesaid. As per section 234C of the Act,
interest is required to be calculated on the basis of returned income and not
on the basis of assessed income. The Assessing Officer erred on facts and in v
in charging interest u/s 234C on assessed Income instead of returned Income as
per the provisions of Act. The aforesaid issue is now covered in favour of the
assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY
2007-08 and 2008-09. The assessing officer should, therefore, be directed to
recompute interest under section 234C of the Act, as aforesaid.
96\. The Ld. DR relied upon the Assessment Order.
97\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. Accepting the contention of the assessee, the Tribunal
observed as under:
"3.6.2 We have heard both parties perused the records and considered the

against the tax payable. In this case, the tax payable under section 140A also
included interest payable under section 234B. The issue is whether the
interest payable under section 234B which has to be first adjusted against the
payment u/s 140A has to be calculated with respect to  170 ITA No.
467/Del/2014 total income as declared in the return or total income determined
in the regular assessment.
We find that the section 140(1B) provides that interest payable under section
234B, has to be computed on the amount by which the advance paid falls short
of assessed tax and the assessed tax for the purpose of this sub-section has
been defined in the Explanation to mean the tax on total income as declared in

in section 234B. The assessee has also followed the same procedure with which
we agree. The order of CIT(A) confirming the method followed by the AO is
therefore set aside and the claim of the assessee is allowed. "
The aforesaid issue is now covered in favour of the assessee by the Delhi
Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 and 2008-09. The
Assessing Officer is, therefore, directed to recompute interest under section
234B of the Act, as aforesaid. As per section 234C of the Act, interest is
required to be calculated on the basis of returned income and not on the basis
of assessed income. The Assessing Officer erred on facts and in v in charging
interest u/s 234C on assessed Income instead of returned Income as per the
provisions of Act. The aforesaid issue is now covered in favour of the
assessee by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for AY
2007-08 and 2008-09. Therefore, we remand back this issue to the file of the
Assessing  171 ITA No. 467/Del/2014 Officer and direct the Assessing Officer
to recomputed interest under section 234C of the Act, as aforesaid. Needless
to say, the assessee be given opportunity of hearing by following principles
of natural justice.
98\. In result, Ground Nos. 19 and 19.1 are partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
99\. In result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for statistical
purpose.
