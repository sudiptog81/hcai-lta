JUDGMENT Krishan Kumar Acharya, J.
1\. This misc. petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by Smt. Tipu
Devi and Kesara Ram for quashing of the FIR No. 10/2007 registered at Police
Station Sindhari, District Barmer for offence under Section 447 and 427
2\. According to the facts inter alia narrated in the misc. petition, the land
bearing Khasra No. 57/1 is "Gairmumkin Abadi" Land and vests in the Gram
Panchayat Kamthai The petitioner No. 1 is presently Sarpanch of Gram Panchayat
Kamthai. A copy of Jamabandi for Samwat 2059 to 2062 in respect of the said
land has been placed on record. It is also submitted that District Education
Officer-cum- Ex officio Project Coordinator, Serva Shiksha Abhiyan, Barmer
vide notification dated 6.7.2006 issued an administrative and financial
sanction for construction of additional class room various schools including
the Government Primary School, Raneri. In the order dated 6.7.2006, the
Government Primary School Raneri appears at serial No. 91. In the said
notification, it has specifically been mentioned that the construction shall
17\. In the case of Medical Chemicals & Pharma Pvt. v. Biological E. Ltd.
reported in 2000 Cr.L.J. 1487, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
In the matter of exercise of High Court's inherent power, the only requirement
is to see whether continuance of the proceeding would be a total abuse of the
process of Court. The Criminal Procedure Code contains a detailed procedure
for investigation, charge and trial and in the event, the High Court is
desirous of putting a stop to the known procedure of law, the High Court must
use a proper circumspection and as noticed above, very great care and caution
to quash the complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.
18\. Keeping in view the above decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, since the
matter is under investigation, this Court cannot enter into the factual
scenario of the case nor pre-judge the matter. In this case, from a bare
perusal of the case-diary, it is clear that the official of the Panchayat
institution have demolished the newly constructed school building and caused
damage to the public property. Therefore, without commenting on the merits of
this case, at this stage, looking to all the facts and circumstances of the
notification, it has specifically been mentioned that the construction shall
be done only on the land which is in the name of school.
3\. It is further submitted that before raising construction, 'no objection'
was not obtained from Gram Panchayat and construction was got started at the
instance of respondent No. 2.
4\. On 2.2.2007, the petitioner No. 1 issued a notice to the respondent No. 2
-Head Master, Government Primary School, Raneri asking him to stop the
construction work but when the construction work was not stopped then on
20.2.2007, a resolution was taken by the Panchayat to stop the construction
and to take building material in its possession. A copy of letter dated
20.2.2007 was also sent to SHO, Police Station Sindhari. It is further
submitted that since unauthorized construction was not stopped, the petitioner
No. 1 while discharging her official duties as Sarpanch with the aid of police
demolished the unauthorized and illegal construction of the school room and
the building material was taken into possession by the Gram Panchayat. A
notice was also given to the respondent No. 2 for depositing the expenses of
demolition of the unauthorized construction which was removed to keep the
Panchayat land free from any encroachment and trespass.
5\. Learned Counsel for the petitioners stated that this false FIR has been
lodged against the petitioners due to political rivalry. The petitioner No. 1
has done the said act while discharging her official duties. He has cited
before me the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court (i) 1992 Cri.L.J.527 State of
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal; (ii) ; Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC Indian Ltd. and
Ors. and (iii) ; Ajay Mitra v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. and stated
that since the present FIR has been lodged malafidely and with ulterior
motive, therefore, it may be quashed.
6\. In reply, learned Counsel for the respondent as well as learned Public
Prosecutor have stated that budget was sanctioned for construction of the
school building and the construction was also done in the boundary wall of the
school itself. It is further stated that Gram Panchayat had no authority to
remove the construction raised in the school premises. The petitioners have
taken the law in their hands and caused damage to the public property. Learned
Counsel for the respondent further stated that from the perusal of the FIR, it
appears that cognizable offence has been committed. The allegations made in
the complaint prima facie satisfy the essential ingredients of the alleged
offence. He further stated that FIR has not been lodged with malafides for
wreaking vengeance or to cause harm to the petitioners. Therefore, he prayed
that at this stage, this Court should not interfere with the investigation. In
support of his arguments, learned Counsel for the respondent has cited before
me the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court (i) 2004 (13) SCC 437; State of
Punjab through Secretary, Home v. Subhash Kumar and Ors. and (ii) 2007
Cri.L.J. 170; Ajeet Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.
7\. I have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned Counsel for
the parties and gone through the FIR impugned. I have also gone through the
judgments cited by learned Counsel for both the parties.
8\. The instant FIR has been lodged by respondent No. 2- Head Master,
Government Primary School, Raneri, District Barmer in which he has alleged
that Smt. Tipu Devi, the present Sarpanch and her husband Kesa Ram had come
with JCB and Tractor-jeep and demolished the construction raised in the school
premises. The police after investigation also found that prima facie, case for
the alleged offence is made out against the petitioners. The petitioners have
demolished the newly constructed school building and caused loss of Rs.
80,000/- to the Government. The Investigating Agency has also found that the
land bearing Khasra No. 57/1 belongs to Education Department and complete land
is in the possession of School and Government Department. There are four walls
on the said land and new construction was also made in the boundary wall of
the school premises. From the perusal of the FIR, it cannot be said that no
cognizable offence has been committed. The allegations made in the complaint
prima facie satisfy the essential ingredients of the alleged offences.
9\. In the case of State of Harayana v. Bhajan Lal (Supra) cited by learned
Counsel for the petitioners, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in para No.
108 as under:
In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of
the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this
Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extra-ordinary
power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code
which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories
of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either
to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends
of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly
defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such
power should be exercised.
1\. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against
the accused.
2\. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials,
if any, accompanying the F.I.R. Do not disclose a cognizable offence,
justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the
Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
3\. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of
any offence and make out a case against the accused.
4\. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. Do not constitute a cognizable
offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of
a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
5\. Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a
just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused.
6\. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of
the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is
instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where
there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing
efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
7\. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or
where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for
wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private
and personal grudge.
10\. As far as this case is concerned, it is clear from the case-diary that
the ingredients of cognizable offence is prima facie made out against the
petitioners. At this stage, this Court cannot reach to the conclusion whether
FIR is mala fide one or it has been instituted maliciously as in the present
case public property has been damaged and FIR has been lodged by the public
servant. Thus, it cannot be said that this is mala fide institution of the FIR
or it has been lodged for wreaking vengeance. The school building was
constructed by public money and it was demolished by the official of the
Panchayat Institution, therefore, this judgment docs not help the learned
Counsel for the petitioner. This case does not fall in any of the above 7
categories.
11\. As far as Ajay Mitra v. State of Madhya Pradesh's case (supra) is
concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that when allegation made in
complaint do not prima face disclose commission of offence, it can be quashed
but in the present case, the ingredients of offence under Section 447 and 427
is clearly made out from the FIR itself. The public property was also damaged.
Therefore, this judgment also would not help to the petitioners. As far other
judgments cited by learned Counsel for the petitioners is concerned, they are
also not applicable to the present case as in the present case, still
investigation is going on and it is not the proper stage to see whether school
was made in the Nadi area or whether sanction was required to be taken or not.
It is clear that the school building was already existing and new construction
of additional class-room was being raised in the school building.
12\. In the case of State of Punjab v. Subhash Kumar (supra) cited by learned
Counsel for the respondent, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that when FIR
is under investigation, Court cannot enter into factual arena.
13\. I would also like to mention here that in the case of 10 Central Bureau
of Investigation v. Ravi Shanker Srivastva, IAS and Anr. reported in 2006
Cri.L.J. 4050, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered all the submissions
advanced in the present case by counsel for the petitioners.
14\. In the case of State of Karnataka and Anr v. Pastor P. Raju reported in
2006 Cri.L.J. 4045, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
The petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was filed within 12 days on 27.1.2005
when the investigation had just commenced. The petition was allowed by the
High Court on 23.2.2005 when the investigation was still under progress. No
report as contemplated by Section 173 Cr.P.C. had been submitted by the
incharge of the police station concerned to the Magistrate empowered to take
cognizance of the offence. Section 482 Cr.P.C. saves inherent powers of the
High Court and such a power can be exercised to prevent abuse of the process
of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. This power can be
exercised to quash the criminal proceedings pending in any Court but the power
cannot be exercised to interfere with the statutory power of the police to
conduct investigation in a cognizable offence.
15\. In the case of Central Bureau of Investigation v. Ravi Shanker
Srivastava, IAS and Anr. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court while relying on
the judgments of Bhajan Lal's as well as other cases cited by learned Counsel
for the petitioners, has held as under:
One of the many categories of cases where inherent power can and should be
exercised to quash the proceedings is where the allegations constitute an
offence, but there is no legal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced
clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge. While dealing with the such
case, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where
there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is clear
inconsistent with the accusations made, and a case where there is legal
evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not support the accusations. When
exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court would
not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is
reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would
not be sustained. That is the function of the trial Judge.
16\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has further held in para 9 of the aforesaid
judgment as under:
When an information is lodged at the police station and an offence is
registered, then the mala fides of the information would be of secondary
importance. It is the material collected during the investigation and evidence
led in Court which decides the fate of the accused person. The allegations of
mala fides against the informant are of no consequences and cannot by
themselves be the basis for quashing the proceedings.
17\. In the case of Medical Chemicals & Pharma Pvt. v. Biological E. Ltd.
reported in 2000 Cr.L.J. 1487, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
In the matter of exercise of High Court's inherent power, the only requirement
is to see whether continuance of the proceeding would be a total abuse of the
process of Court. The Criminal Procedure Code contains a detailed procedure
for investigation, charge and trial and in the event, the High Court is
desirous of putting a stop to the known procedure of law, the High Court must
use a proper circumspection and as noticed above, very great care and caution
to quash the complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.
18\. Keeping in view the above decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, since the
matter is under investigation, this Court cannot enter into the factual
scenario of the case nor pre-judge the matter. In this case, from a bare
perusal of the case-diary, it is clear that the official of the Panchayat
institution have demolished the newly constructed school building and caused
damage to the public property. Therefore, without commenting on the merits of
this case, at this stage, looking to all the facts and circumstances of the
case, since the allegations made in the complaint prima facie satisfy the
essential ingredients of the alleged offences, 1 find no ground to quash the
impugned FIR.
19\. Accordingly, this misc. petition is hereby dismissed.
17\. In the case of Medical Chemicals & Pharma Pvt. v. Biological E. Ltd.
reported in 2000 Cr.L.J. 1487, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:
