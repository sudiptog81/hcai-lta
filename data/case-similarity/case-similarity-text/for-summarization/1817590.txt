Central Government Act
Section 19 in The Transfer of Property Act, 1882
19\. Vested interest.—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is
created in favour of a person without specifying the time when it is to take
effect, or in terms specifying that it is to take effect forthwith or on the
happening of an event which must happen, such interest is vested, unless a
contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer. A vested interest
is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession.
Explanation.—An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be
inferred merely from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed,
or whereby a prior interest in the same property is given or reserved to some
other person, or whereby income arising from the property is directed to be
accumulated until the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a
particular event shall happen the interest shall pass to another person.
