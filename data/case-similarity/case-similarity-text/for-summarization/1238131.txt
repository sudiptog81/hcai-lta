ORAL JUDGMENT (Per. DR.D.Y.CHANDRACHUD, J.) :
1\. Admit. On the request of counsel for the Revenue and counsel for the
the proceeds. It lies within the discretion of the exporter as to whether the
export proceeds should be received in a rupee equivalent in the entirety or
whether a portion should be maintained in convertible foreign exchange in the
EEFC Account. The exchange fluctuation that arises, it must be emphasized, is
after the export transaction is complete and payment has been received by the
exporter. Upon the completion of the export transaction, what the seller does
with the proceeds, upon repatriation, is a matter of his option. The exchange
fluctuation in the EEFC Account arises after the completion of the export
activity and does not bear a proximate and direct nexus with the export
transaction so as to fall within the expression "derived" by the assessee in
sub section (1) of Section 80HHC." (emphasis supplied) In the present case,
the assessee has realized a larger amount in  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013

fluctuation that took place in the course of the export transaction.
16\. For the aforesaid reasons, the question of law is answered against the
Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
1\. Admit. On the request of counsel for the Revenue and counsel for the
assessee, the appeal is taken up for final hearing.
2\. This appeal by the Revenue under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961
pertains to Assessment Year 2003-04 and the following questions of law have
been formulated in support of the appeal :

Re Question a :
3\. According to the Revenue the exemption under Section 10A ::: Downloaded on
- 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 3 is liable to be computed after excluding freight
and insurance from the total turnover. The Commissioner (Appeals) affirmed the
view of the Assessing Officer and held that Section 10A does not define
turnover and that in the circumstances, the Assessing Officer was correct in
not reducing insurance and freight from the total turnover while computing the
deduction under Section 10A. In appeal the Tribunal held that (i) The
expression "total turnover"
has not been defined in Section 10A; (ii) Profits derived from export have to
be computed by taking into consideration both the export turnover and total
turnover of the business carried on by the undertaking; (iii) Both the export
turnover and total turnover which constitute the numerator and denominator in
the application of the formula under sub section (4) of Section 10A should be
comparable; and (iv) Freight and insurance have no element of profit and
hence, cannot be included in the total turnover of the business carried on by
the industrial undertaking.
The Tribunal accordingly directed that the deduction under Section 10A should
be computed after excluding freight and insurance from the total turnover. It
is this finding of the Tribunal which is  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
16:03:02 ::: 4 questioned by the Revenue in appeal.
4\. Under sub section (1) of Section 10A a deduction is allowed from the total
income of the assessee of such profits and gains as are derived by an
undertaking from the export of articles or things or computer software for a
period of ten consecutive assessment years commencing from the assessment year
relevant to the previous year in which the undertaking begins manufacture or
production. Sub section (4) of Section 10A provides the manner in which the
profits derived from the export of articles or things or computer software
shall be computed. Sub section (4) provides as follows :
> "For the purposes of sub sections (1) and (1A), the profits derived from
> export of articles or things or computer software shall be the amount which
> bears to the profits of the business of the undertaking, the same proportion
> as the export turnover in respect of such articles or things or computer
> software bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the
> undertaking."
5\. Under sub section (4) the proportion between the export turnover in
respect of the articles or things, or as the case may be,  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 5 computer software exported, to the total turnover of
the business carried over by the undertaking is applied to the profits of the
business of the undertaking in computing the profits derived from export. In
other words, the profits of the business of the undertaking are multiplied by
the export turnover in respect of the articles, things or, as the case may be,
computer software and divided by the total turnover of the business carried on
by the undertaking. The formula which is prescribed by sub section (4) of
Section 10A is as follows :
> Profits derived from export of articles or things or computer software =
> Profits of the business export turnover in respect of the undertaking X of
> the articles or things or computer software
> ____________________________________________________ divided by total
> turnover of the business carried on by the undertaking.
The total turnover of the business carried on by the undertaking would consist
of the turnover from export and the turnover from local sales. The export
turnover constitutes the numerator in the  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
16:03:02 ::: 6 formula prescribed by sub section (4). Export turnover also
forms a constituent element of the denominator inasmuch as the export turnover
is a part of the total turnover.
6\. The export turnover, in the numerator must have the same meaning as the
export turnover which is a constituent element of the total turnover in the
denominator. The legislature has provided a definition of the expression
"export turnover" in Explanation (2) to Section 10A by which the expression is
defined to mean the consideration in respect of export by the undertaking of
articles, things or computer software received in or brought into India by the
assessee in convertible foreign exchange but so as not to include inter alia
freight, telecommunication charges or insurance attributable to the delivery
of the articles, things or software outside India. Therefore in computing the
export turnover the legislature has made a specific exclusion of freight and
insurance charges.
7\. The submission which has been urged on behalf of the  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 7 Revenue is that while freight and insurance charges
are liable to be excluded in computing export turnover, a similar exclusion
has not been provided in regard to total turnover. The submission of the
Revenue, however, misses the point that the expression "total turnover" has
not been defined at all by Parliament for the purposes of Section 10A.
However, the expression "export turnover" has been defined. The definition of
"export turnover"
excludes freight and insurance. Since export turnover has been defined by
Parliament and there is a specific exclusion of freight and insurance, the
expression "export turnover" cannot have a different meaning when it forms a
constituent part of the total turnover for the purposes of the application of
the formula.
Undoubtedly, it was open to Parliament to make a provision to the contrary.
However, no such provision having been made, the principle which has been
enunciated earlier must prevail as a matter of correct statutory
interpretation. Any other interpretation would lead to an absurdity. If the
contention of the Revenue were to be accepted, the same expression viz.
'export turnover' would have a different connotation in the application of the
same  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 8 formula. The submission of
the Revenue would lead to a situation where freight and insurance, though it
has been specifically excluded from "export turnover" for the purposes of the
numerator would be brought in as part of the "export turnover"
when it forms an element of the total turnover as a denominator in the
formula. A construction of a statutory provision which would lead to an
absurdity must be avoided.
8\. The view which we have taken is consistent with the view which was taken,
though in the context of Section 80HHC, by a Division Bench of this Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax v.
Sudarshan Chemicals Industries Ltd.1 In Sudarshan Chemicals the question of
law that fell for decision was whether sales tax and excise duty ought to be
included in the total turnover while working out the deduction under Section
80HHC. For the purposes of Section 80HHC, clause (b) of sub section (3)
provides that the profits derived from export shall be computed in terms of
the proportion between the export turnover to the total turnover 1 (2000) 245
ITR 769.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 9
as applied to the profits of business. Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.H.
Kapadia (as the Learned Chief Justice then was ) speaking for a Division Bench
of this Court did not accept the contention of the Revenue that since the
legislature had excluded only insurance and freight from the total turnover,
it was not open to the assessee to contend that excise duty and sales tax
should also be excluded.
In that context, the Division Bench observed that the meaning of export
turnover in clause (b) of the Explanation to Section 80HHC showed that export
turnover did not include excise duty and sales tax. The Division Bench
observed that the export turnover is the numerator in the formula whereas the
total turnover is the denominator. The formula having been prescribed to
arrive at profits from exports, sales tax and excise duty could not form part
of the total turnover. If the denominator were to include those two items and
the numerator excluded them, the formula (noted the Division Bench), would
become unworkable. In the circumstances, the Division Bench held that while
ascertaining the export profits, excise duty and sales tax could not be
introduced to inflate the total turnover artificially in order to reduce the
benefit to which  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 10 the assessee
is entitled. The decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Sudarshan
Chemical Industries has been cited with approval by the Supreme Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax v. Lakshmi Machine Works2. The same view has been
taken by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v.
Catapharma (India) Pvt. Ltd.3 in which the decision of the Division Bench in
Sudarshan Chemical Industries has also been adverted to.
9\. Moreover, a receipt such as freight and insurance which does not have any
element of profit cannot be included in the total turnover. In Lakshmi Machine
Works (supra) the Supreme Court held that excise duty and sales tax did not
possess any element of turnover since they are merely recoverable by the
assessee on behalf of the Government.
10\. Freight and insurance do not have an element of turnover.
For this reason in addition, these two items would have to be 2 (2007) 290 ITR
667 (SC).
3 (2007) 292 ITR 641 (SC).
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 11
excluded from the total turnover particularly in the absence of a legislative
prescription to the contrary. The first question of law would therefore have
to be answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
Re Question b :
11\. For the purposes of the appeal it is necessary to refer to the admitted
position which is that the assessee had deposited both the employer's and the
employees' contribution towards Provident Fund and ESIC, though beyond the due
date including the grace period. The Assessing Officer added these payments to
the total income of the assessee and made an addition in the amount of Rs.
71.59 lacs. However, for the deduction under Section 10A, the addition made on
account of the employees' contribution was ignored in calculating the profits
eligible for deduction on the ground that these receipts were not generated
out of the manufacturing activity of the assessee company.
12\. By reason of the judgment of the Supreme Court in  ::: Downloaded on -
09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 12 Commissioner of Income Tax v. Alom Extrusions
Limited4 the employer's contribution was liable to be allowed, since it was
deposited by the due date for the filing of the return. The peculiar position,
however, as it obtains in the present case arises out of the fact that the
disallowance which was effected by the Assessing Officer has not, the Court is
informed, been challenged by the assessee. As a matter of fact the question of
law which is formulated by the Revenue proceeds on the basis that the assessed
income was enhanced due to the disallowance of the employer's as well as the
employees' contribution towards Provident Fund /ESIC and the only question
which is canvassed on behalf of the Revenue is whether on that basis the
Tribunal was justified in directing the Assessing Officer to grant the
exemption under Section 10A. On this position, in the present case it cannot
be disputed that the net consequence of the disallowance of the employer's and
the employee's contribution is that the business profits have to that extent
been enhanced. There was, as we have already noted, an add back by the
Assessing Officer to the income. All profits of the 4 (2009) 319 ITR 306  :::
Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 13 unit of the assessee have been
derived from manufacturing activity.
The salaries paid by the assessee, it has not been disputed, relate to the
manufacturing activity. The disallowance of the Provident Fund/ ESIC payments
has been made because of the statutory provisions - Section 43B in the case of
the employer's contribution and Section 36(v) read with Section 2(24)(x) in
the case of the employee's contribution which has been deemed to be the income
of the assessee. The plain consequence of the disallowance and the add back
that has been made by the Assessing Officer is an increase in the business
profits of the assessee. The contention of the Revenue that in computing the
deduction under Section 10A the addition made on account of the disallowance
of the Provident Fund / ESIC payments ought to be ignored cannot be accepted.
No statutory provision to that effect having been made, the plain consequence
of the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer must follow. The second
question shall accordingly stand answered against the Revenue and in favour of
the assessee.
Re Questions c and d :
13\. Counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue and counsel  ::: Downloaded on
- 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 14 appearing on behalf of the assessee are agreed in
stating that these two questions of law will stand covered in favour of the
Revenue and against the assessee by the judgment of this Court dated 18/19
March 2010 in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Asian Star Company Limited (ITA
200 of 2009). Both these questions of law are accordingly answered in the
negative in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
Re Question e :
14\. The Tribunal has followed a decision of its Special Bench in coming to
the conclusion that foreign exchange earned on the realization of export
receipts in a year other than the year in which the goods were exported would
have to be considered in the year of export for the purpose of exemption under
Section 80HHC. The Tribunal has, however, directed the Assessing Officer,
while granting a deduction to the assessee under Section 10A in the year of
export to exclude the amount from the profits of the year under consideration
simultaneously. This is to ensure that the assessee does not obtain a
deduction twice over.
::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:03:02 ::: 15
15\. For the purposes of the appeal it has not been disputed on behalf of the
Revenue that the foreign exchange was realized by the assessee within the
period stipulated in law. The assessee realized a larger amount because of a
foreign exchange fluctuation. The fact that this forms part of the sale
proceeds would have to be accepted in view of the judgment of the Division
Bench of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Amber Export (India) (ITA
1249 of 2007 decided on 18 February 2009).
The judgment of this Court in turn followed the decision of the Gujarat High
Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Amba Impex5. The sole ground which has
been urged on behalf of the Revenue in support of the appeal on this issue is
based on the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in Commissioner of
Income Tax v. Shah Originals (ITA 431 of 2008 decided on 22 April 2010). The
decision in Shah Originals is, however, distinguishable for the reason that
the foreign fluctuation in that case arose after the export transaction had
been completed and 5 (2006) 282 ITR 144 (Guj)  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013
16:03:02 ::: 16 after the export profits were deposited by the assessee in an
EEFC Account. This is evident from the following observations :

The transaction of export is complete in all respects upon the repatriation of
the proceeds. It lies within the discretion of the exporter as to whether the
export proceeds should be received in a rupee equivalent in the entirety or
whether a portion should be maintained in convertible foreign exchange in the

and insurance from the total turnover. The Commissioner (Appeals) affirmed the
the proceeds. It lies within the discretion of the exporter as to whether the
export proceeds should be received in a rupee equivalent in the entirety or
whether a portion should be maintained in convertible foreign exchange in the
EEFC Account. The exchange fluctuation that arises, it must be emphasized, is
after the export transaction is complete and payment has been received by the
exporter. Upon the completion of the export transaction, what the seller does
with the proceeds, upon repatriation, is a matter of his option. The exchange
fluctuation in the EEFC Account arises after the completion of the export
activity and does not bear a proximate and direct nexus with the export
transaction so as to fall within the expression "derived" by the assessee in
sub section (1) of Section 80HHC." (emphasis supplied) In the present case,
the assessee has realized a larger amount in  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013

fluctuation that took place in the course of the export transaction.

Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
