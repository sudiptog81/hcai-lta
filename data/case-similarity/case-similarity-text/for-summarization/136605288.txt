Film. What they have assigned to the Plaintiff is only the Original film and
nothing more. This being the case, there is no question of passing off the
impugned film as that of the original film. This is more so, when one takes
into consideration the Affidavit-in- Reply filed by the Defendants wherein
they have specifically stated that the impugned film "De Dhakka-2" is neither
a re- make nor a copy in any manner similar to the Original Film "De Dhakka".
It is further stated that the music is also different and not a single
dialogue or music is copied from the original film "De Dhakka". I, therefore,
find that even the argument of passing off is of no avail to the Plaintiff.
17\. In these circumstances, I prima facie find that the Plaintiff has not
made out any strong prima facie case for grant of ad-interim reliefs. Ad-
interim reliefs are accordingly rejected. The Interim Application shall come
up in usual course.
18\. It is needless to clarify that the observations made  23/24 901-IA-1-2019

                                             CORAM :   B. P. COLABAWALLA, J.
DATED :- 4th MARCH, 2020.
P.C. :-
1\. The controversy in the present Suit arises in respect of a film "De
Dhakka-2" (for short "the impugned film") which is being produced by the
Defendants. According to the Plaintiff, this impugned film is evidently a
sequel of the film titled "De Dhakka" (for short "the Original Film"). The
Plaintiff claims to be the absolute, sole and exclusive owner of the
Intellectual Property Rights subsisting in the Original Film and, according to
the Plaintiff, the production and other related activities carried out by the
Defendants in respect of the impugned film, violate the Intellectual Property
Rights of the Plaintiff in the Original Film. It is, in these circumstances,
that the Plaintiff has sought for a permanent injunction restraining the
Defendants from in any manner infringing the Plaintiff's copyright and trade
marks in the Original Film as well as a restraint order from using the words
"De Dhakka" in the title of any film to be produced by the Defendants so as to
pass off such film as that of the Plaintiff and/or in any manner associated
with the  2/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on -
05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: Plaintiff.
2\. The factual conspectus giving rise to the present controversy is quite
narrow. The Plaintiff's scope of business majorly involves the procurement,
development, production, distribution and dissemination of entertainment,
television programmes, cinematographic feature films etc. The Plaintiff has
made significant investment towards acquiring rights of Cinematographic
contents from authorized right holders.
3\. On 26th February, 2008 the Plaintiff executed with Defendant No.4, a legal
entity, owned and represented by Defendant No.3, a Deed of Assignment, whereby
defendant No.4 assigned to the Plaintiff the "Negative Rights" for the
"PROGRAMME" (i.e. the Original Film) and more particularly set out in the Deed
of Assignment. The Original Film "De Dhakka" was a Cinematographic Film in
Marathi language which was released in the year 2008 and was a significant
commercial success. The Original Film "De Dhakka" was produced by Satya Films
(Defendant No.4). According to the Plaintiff, under the aforesaid Deed of
Assignment, Defendant No.4 assigned the Negative Rights of the Original Film
"De Dhakka"  3/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on -
05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: to the Plaintiff, fully
and absolutely, on the terms and conditions set out in the said Deed of
Assignment.
4\. Dr. Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the
Plaintiff submitted that in or about October, 2019 the Plaintiff was surprised
to see an Article in various media that Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are producing
and Defendant No.3 is directing the sequel of the Original Film "De Dhakka"
under the title "De Dhakka 2" (the impugned film). He submitted that these
media articles indicate that defendant Nos. 1 to 3 have in the impugned film,
used the same characters as that in the Original Film. It is evident from the
media articles that the impugned film has illegally and wrongfully used the
intellectual property rights of the Original Film i.e. the title, characters,
the underline literary work etc., which solely and absolutely subsists in the
Plaintiff pursuant to the Deed of Assignment referred to earlier. It is in
these circumstances that Dr. Tulzapurkar stated that the Plaintiff was
constrained to give a legal notice dated 19th October, 2019 calling upon the
Defendants to cease and desist from using the title of the Original Film "De
Dhakka"; cease and desist from using the characters, the underline literary
work or any other Intellectual Property Rights of the Original Film  4/24
901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 :::
Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: "De Dhakka" in any manner whatsoever;
cease and desist from making any derivative work such as sequel to the
Original Film without authorization from the Plaintiff; and cease and desist
from creating any third party rights in relation to the Original Film
including derivative rights of the Original Film in violation of Plaintiff's
rights therein. Since there was no reply to the aforesaid legal notice, the
present suit was filed.
5\. Dr. Tulzapurkar submitted that in this factual backdrop if one reads the
Deed of Assignment, as a whole and in its entirety, it was clear that not only
the original film "De Dhakka" was assigned in favour of the Plaintiff but also
all other rights that are existing as also those that may be discovered or
come into being in the future were assigned in favour of the Plaintiff. He
submitted that this being the case, it was clear that even the right to make a
sequel to the Original Film "De Dhakka", by virtue of the Deed of Assignment,
vested in the Plaintiff and the Defendants could not produce a sequel without
the proper authorization of the Plaintiff. In this regard, Dr. Tulzapurkar
placed reliance on certain clauses, namely, clause 1 (b), clause 2 (ix),
clause 3 and clause 5 of the Deed of Assignment. He submitted that when
reading these clauses together and  5/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc
::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 :::
harmoniously, it was clear that the intention of the parties was not only to
assign the Original Film "De Dhakka" but also all future rights that may arise
from the said Film. This would include the making of a sequel, was the
submission of Dr. Tulzapurkar. He therefore submitted that the Plaintiff has
made out a strong prima facie case for grant of ad-interim reliefs in terms of
the prayer clauses set out in the Interim Application.
6\. On the other hand, Mr. Harshad Bhadbhade, the learned Counsel appearing on
behalf of the Defendants, submitted that there was no merit in the contentions
raised on behalf of the Plaintiff. He submitted that the present Suit was
filed on the basis of a presumption that the Plaintiff is having a copyright
in respect of the title of the movie "De Dhakka" or in respect of the
production of a sequel to the said movie. He submitted that no such right is
created in favour of the Plaintiff either in respect of the title or in
respect of production of a sequel and hence the suit itself is wholly
misconceived. Mr. Bhadbhade submitted that the Negative Rights granted to the
Plaintiff under the Deed of Assignment do not include any right over the title
"De Dhakka" or the right to produce a sequel of the said Original Film. He
submitted that the movie "De Dhakka-  6/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: 2" (the impugned film) is entirely based on a
different story line and a different concept. He submitted that what has been
assigned under the Deed of Assignment dated 26th February, 2008 is the
Negative Rights of the movie "De Dhakka" and no right to make a prequel or a
sequel to the movie were assigned to the Plaintiff. By the said Assignment
what was transferred was the ownership rights in the negatives of the
programme / film "De Dhakka" for the purposes of exhibition, distribution and
exploitation of theatrical and non-theatrical rights, commercial rights,
satellite broadcasting in any manner and even mobile rights of the movie "De
Dhakka". In addition, what was also given were rights to broadcast "De Dhakka"
in any manner which may be discovered or come into being in the future. He
submitted that it is not in dispute that Defendant No.3/4 were the producers
of the Original Film "De Dhakka" and all that was agreed to be assigned under
the Deed of Assignment was the negative rights of the said movie to the
plaintiff and did include any right of a prequel or sequel to the said movie.
He submitted that in any event the movie "De Dhakka-2" (the impugned film) has
a totally different script, different dialogues, different concept, a
different character and different locations as well as different music. He
submitted that the impugned film is neither a remake nor a copy  7/24
901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 :::
Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: or in any manner similar to the
original movie "De Dhakka". He submitted that the music is also different and
not a single dialogue or music is copied from the original film. To
substantiate his arguments, Mr. Bhadbhade also drew my attention to several
clauses of the Deed of Assignment namely clause 1 (a), 1(b), clause 5 (a),
clause 6, 12, 13 and 14. He submitted that what is important to note is that
nowhere in the Deed of Assignment the words prequel or sequel have been used
so as to confer such rights on the Plaintiff.
7\. As far as the argument of Dr. Tulzapurkar regarding passing off in
relation to the title of the Original Film "De Dhakka" is concerned, he
submitted that there was no question of any passing off as this was a sequel
and there was no question of trying to pass off the impugned film as the
Original Film thereby creating any confusion in the mind of the viewers. He
submitted that admittedly the producer of the original film was defendant no.4
and the impugned film also was being produced by the defendants.
8\. In support of all his submissions, Mr. Bhadbhade relying upon the
following two decisions:-

2017 SCC OnLine Bom 2432 Mr. Bhadbhade therefore submitted that there was no
merit for grant of any reliefs to the Plaintiff and hence ad-interim relief be
rejected.
9\. I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and have perused the
papers and proceedings in the Suit as well as the Interim Application and the
Affidavit-in-Reply.
10\. To decide the present controversy what is required to be seen are the
clauses in the Deed of Assignment dated 26th February, 2008 and thereafter to
ascertain as to what rights have been assigned in favour of the Plaintiff. The
Deed of Assignment is entered into between the Plaintiff and Defendant No.4
for the "Negative Rights" of the said film. In the said Deed of Assignment,
the Assignor is described as Defendant No.4 (represented by defendant No.3)
and the Assignee is described as the Plaintiff. The  9/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: Deed of Assignment further records that Defendant No.4
is the purchaser of "Negative Rights" of the feature film "De Dhakka" more
particularly mentioned in Schedule-I and Schedule-II to the Deed of
Assignment. Thereafter, the recitals set out that Defendant No.4 was willing
to and approached the Plaintiff to take the absolute assignment of the
"Negative Rights" of the said "PROGRAMME" described in Schedule-I and II on
the terms and conditions mentioned in the said Deed of Assignment. Thereafter,
there are certain definitions which can be found in clause (1) of the Deed of
Assignment. clause 1 (a) defines the word "PROGRAMME" and reads thus :-
> clause 1 (a) :-
> 1) The ASSIGNOR and ASSIGNEE agree for the purpose of this agreement :-
> (a) The word "PROGRAMME" shall mean one or more of each of the entire
> PROGRAMME described on each page of annexed SCHEDULE-II whether it be a
> single audio-visual document or a series thereof and this irrespective of
> the technical medium. If more than one, they would be described as Programme
> 1, Programme 2 and so on. All such Programme shall constitute the
> "PROGRAMME". In case of Film it shall mean the Cinematograph Films as
> defined in the Copyright Act, 1957 in India with amendments if any and/or as
> defined in any other laws of other countries where any action is taken under
> this Agreement.

1 (b) defines the words "NEGATIVE RIGHTS" and reads thus :-
> (b) NEGATIVE RIGHTS means the rights assigned under this agreement
> specifically mentioned in SCHEDULE-I attached herewith and defined as under
> :-
> Negative Rights of the film shall mean the total and absolute ownership
> rights in the negatives of the programme for the purpose of including but

> discovered or come into being in future.
(emphasis supplied) Thereafter, clause (2) deals with the declarations given
by the ASSIGNOR, namely, Defendant No.4 and for our purposes clause 2 (v),
(ix), and (x) are relevant which read thus :-
(2) The ASSIGNOR declares and affirms that :-

(v) The ASSIGNOR has not created any charge, lien, mortgage or any other
encumbrance on the said PROGRAMME for the said Negative rights in favour of
any Artist, Writer, Technician, Laboratory, Financier or any other Person,
Party, Company, Organization whatsoever.
(ix) The ASSIGNOR hereby declares and affirms that all the rights already
created in favour to the Assignee and the ASSIGNEE shall be free to deal with
the said rights as it deems fit and proper.
(x) The ASSIGNOR shall submit all the prints, Video Cassettes and publicity
material and all original documents, papers, censor certificates, related to
the said Programme.
11\. Thereafter, clause (3) records a declaration by Defendant No.4 that he
shall not hereafter grant or in any way transfer the said "Negative rights" or
any other rights that may be discovered or come in future of the said
"PROGRAMME" or any part thereof to any other person, party, company or
organization. clause (3) reads as follows:-
> (3) The ASSIGNOR declares and undertakes that he shall not hereafter grant
> or in any way transfer the said Negative rights or any other rights that may
> be discovered or come in future of the said PROGRAMME or any part thereof to
> any other person, party, company or organization.

under :-

(emphasis supplied) Clause (6) clarifies that the ASSIGNOR shall not have any
claims whatsoever in the said PROGRAMMES referred to in SCHEDULE -I and
SCHEDULE-II. Clauses 12, 13 and 14 are also relevant for our purposes and
hence they are all reproduced hereunder:-

14) If the ASSIGNOR for whatever reason fails to give delivery of the
PROGRAMME or any part thereof of required quality within the stipulated
period, then, the ASSIGNEE shall be entitled for refund of monies paid and
expenses incurred. The ASSIGNOR indemnifies the ASSIGNEE for all amounts in
case the ASSIGNEE is required to defend the acquired rights in the court of
law and the cost of defence would be reimbursed by the ASSIGNOR and the unpaid
instalments if any may be withheld by the  14/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN

(emphasis supplied) Schedule-I to this Deed of Assignment refers to the
parties to the Deed of Assignment and rights that are granted. Schedule-I
specifically states that rights granted are "Negative Rights" and the period
of Assignment is "permanent & Perpetual". The total number of Films mentioned
in Schedule-I is one film and the language of the Film is MARATHi. The total
costs mentioned in Schedule-I is Rs. 80,00,000/-. Schedule-II refers again
only to the original film "De Dhakka" and mentions the Producer as Defendant
No.3 and which also sets out the consideration of Rs.80,00,000/-.
12\. When one goes through all the clauses in this Deed of Assignment and when
read as a whole, I am unable to agree with Dr. Tulzapurkar that the rights to
produce a sequel to the movie "De Dhakka" were also assigned to the Plaintiff.
This is quite clear from the definitions of the words "PROGRAMME" and
"NEGATIVE RIGHTS". As set out earlier, the word "PROGRAMME" means one or more
of which of the entire  15/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  :::
Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: programme
described on each page of SCHEDULE-II. It further clarifies that START FROM
HERE in case of a film it shall mean a cinematographic film as defined in the
Copyright Act, 1957 with Amendments, if any, and/or as defined in any other
laws of other countries where any action is taken under this Agreement. When
one reads Schedule-II, it is quite clear that only the Marathi feature film
"De Dhakka" has been assigned in favour of the Plaintiff. This is also further
made clear from clause 5 (a) reproduced earlier, which, in short, states that
the ASSIGNEE (the Plaintiff) shall/may use the said "PROGRAMME" for the
purposes mentioned in clause (5) in any manner whatsoever for exploiting the
said rights of the said PROGRAMME as is annexed in Schedule-I and Schedule-
II. clause 12 further provides that Defendant No.4 confirms that the
negative/source material of the PROGRAMME ("De Dhakka") is of excellent
quality and takes complete responsibility to provide the said Negative /
source material to the ASSIGNEE (the Plaintiff) on or before the execution of
the Deed of Assignment. In other words, what clause 12 provides is that the
Negative/Source material of the movie "De Dhakka"  16/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: was to be handed over by defendant No.4 to the
Plaintiff. clause 13 also states that the Assignor (Defendant No.4) declares
and affirms that the contents of the assigned film are in conformity with the
laws prevailing in INDIA and have been duly censored by CBFC and the censor
certificate supplied by the ASSIGNOR is the true copy of the original censor
certificate and there are no deletions or additions in the Picture & Sound
negative after the film is certified. On reading of these clauses, prima
facie, I find that what was assigned was only the film "De Dhakka" and not any
right with reference to a sequel or prequel to the said film. In fact, the
words prequel or sequel are conspicuously absent in the Deed of Assignment. I,
therefore, find that under the Deed of Assignment dated 26th February, 2008
there is no right that is assigned to the Plaintiff to produce a sequel or
prequel to the movie "De Dhakka".
13\. In the view that I take, I am supported by a decision of a Division Bench
of this Court in the case of Narendra Hirawat & Co. v. M/s Alumbra
Entertainement & Media Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. [2017 SCC OnLine Bom 2432]. The facts
of  17/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020

paragraph 2 which read thus :-

In this matter, a similar argument was raised with reference to a sequel.
After interpreting the clauses set out in the Deed of Assignment that were
before the Court in that case, the Court gave its findings as under :-

Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: "It is relevant to note that the words
"sequel rights" nowhere appear in the said clause and clause 3 if read with
the other clauses clearly reveals that what has been assigned to the
plaintiffs is only rights in respect of the film "Sarkar". It is a matter of
common knowledge that even after the film is released, it is broad caste on TV
and in other media and if the said film also earns money, all that was
assigned prima facie appears to be rights of remake and not the rights to make
sequel. The said rights prima facie appear to have been assigned to ZPC. It
is, therefore, not possible to accept the submissions made by the plaintiffs,
and therefore, we are not inclined to grant ad-interim relief in favour of the
plaintiffs. It is clarified that the observations made by this Court are
prima-facie in nature and they are made only for the purpose of deciding
whether ad-interim relief can be granted or not. The second ground raised is
the delay on the part of the plaintiffs caused in approaching the Court. It is
well settled that if prompt steps are not taken by the plaintiffs to approach
the Court, the Court will not be inclined to grant ad-interim relief,
particularly when film is about to be released in a couple of days. The order
passed by the learned Single Judge is therefore, confirmed, and the appeal is
dismissed. Hearing of motion is expedited."
14\. I find that this decision squarely applies to the facts of the present
case.
15\. Dr. Tulzapurkar sought to distinguish this decision on the ground that
while in one Deed of Assignment the word "sequel rights" was mentioned in the
other Deed of Assignment, the same was conspicuously absent. It is, in these
19/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 :::
Downloaded on - 06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: circumstances, that the Court took the
view that it did. I am unable to agree with this submission. That is not the
real distinguishing factor. What is important to note is that here also the
words "sequel" or "sequel rights" are conspicuously absent. On reading the
Deed of Assignment as a whole, I do not find that it was the intention of the
parties to assign any rights to the Plaintiff other than what was explicitly
set out in the Deed of Assignment namely the rights to the Film "De Dhakka"
and the exploitation thereof on all platforms whether existing or which may be
developed or come into existence in the future. Dr. Tulzapurkar however
submitted that the words ".....and all other rights that are existing as also
those that may be discovered or come into being in future." appearing in
clause 1
(b) as well as the words ".....the said Negative rights or any other rights
that may be discovered or come in future of the said PROGRAME or any part
thereof to any other person, party, company or organization." appearing in
clause (3) would go to show that even the rights with reference to a sequel
were assigned in favour of the Plaintiff. Prima facie, I am unable to agree
with this submission. Firstly, the Deed of Assignment has to be read as a
whole and a part of a line cannot be taken  20/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: out of context. The words "......and all other rights
that are existing as also those that may be discovered or come into being in
future." appearing in clause 1 (b) would have to be read along with the rights
that are mentioned in the said clause. It is not as if all future rights even
with reference to a sequel have been assigned in favour of the Plaintiff. In
fact, as indicated earlier, clause 12 read with the definition of the words
"Negative Rights" as well as clause 13 clearly indicate that what is
transferred to the Plaintiff under the aforesaid Deed of Assignment are of
rights with reference to the movie "De Dhakka" and nothing else. The rights to
make a sequel do not flow from the said Deed of Assignment. This is also clear
from Schedule-I which clearly states that the total number of films assigned
is one and the rights assigned only are the "Negative Rights" of that film,
namely, "De Dhakka". I therefore prima facie find that Dr. Tulzapurkar is not
correct in his submission when he says that even the rights to make a sequel
were transferred to the Plaintiff under the Deed of Assignment.
16\. Dr. Tulzapurkar then submitted that in any event by using the title "De
Dhakka-2" (for the impugned film), the  21/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: Plaintiffs have a cause of action against the
Defendants for passing off and hence the Defendants ought to be restrained
from using the title "De Dhakka-2". I do not think that this argument also
holds any force. Firstly, it is now well settled that a party cannot claim any
copyright in the title. The works in which copyright subsist has been set out
in Section 13 (1) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and which consists of the
original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work; cinematographic film;
and sound recording. From the aforesaid, it is quite clear that a title of a
work cannot be considered to be the subject- matter of copyright law because a
title by itself is in the nature of a name of a work and is not complete by
itself, without the work. This, in fact, has been so held by the Supreme Court
in the case of Krishika Lulla (supra) and more particularly in Paragraphs 8 to
11 thereof. Therefore, there is no question of claiming any copyright in the
title "De Dhakka". Though the Plaintiff may be able to claim a relief of
passing off, I do not think that a case for passing off is made out in the
instant case. In a case of passing off and as I understand it is, when one
party seeks to pass off its own goods or services as that of another. That is
clearly not the case here. Here what the  22/24 901-IA-1-2019 IN
COMIPL-1287-2019.doc  ::: Uploaded on - 05/03/2020 ::: Downloaded on -
06/03/2020 22:06:06 ::: Defendants are doing is making a sequel to the
original film "De Dhakka" and who were also the Producers of the Original
Film. What they have assigned to the Plaintiff is only the Original film and
nothing more. This being the case, there is no question of passing off the
impugned film as that of the original film. This is more so, when one takes
into consideration the Affidavit-in- Reply filed by the Defendants wherein
they have specifically stated that the impugned film "De Dhakka-2" is neither
a re- make nor a copy in any manner similar to the Original Film "De Dhakka".
It is further stated that the music is also different and not a single
dialogue or music is copied from the original film "De Dhakka". I, therefore,
find that even the argument of passing off is of no avail to the Plaintiff.
17\. In these circumstances, I prima facie find that the Plaintiff has not
made out any strong prima facie case for grant of ad-interim reliefs. Ad-
interim reliefs are accordingly rejected. The Interim Application shall come
up in usual course.
18\. It is needless to clarify that the observations made  23/24 901-IA-1-2019

P.C. :-
1\. The controversy in the present Suit arises in respect of a film "De
Dhakka-2" (for short "the impugned film") which is being produced by the
Defendants. According to the Plaintiff, this impugned film is evidently a
sequel of the film titled "De Dhakka" (for short "the Original Film"). The
Plaintiff claims to be the absolute, sole and exclusive owner of the
Intellectual Property Rights subsisting in the Original Film and, according to
the Plaintiff, the production and other related activities carried out by the
Defendants in respect of the impugned film, violate the Intellectual Property
Rights of the Plaintiff in the Original Film. It is, in these circumstances,
that the Plaintiff has sought for a permanent injunction restraining the
Defendants from in any manner infringing the Plaintiff's copyright and trade
marks in the Original Film as well as a restraint order from using the words
"De Dhakka" in the title of any film to be produced by the Defendants so as to
Film. What they have assigned to the Plaintiff is only the Original film and
nothing more. This being the case, there is no question of passing off the
