JUDGMENT S.C. Mohapatra, J.
1\. This is an application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by a
Government company.
2\. The petitioner claims to be carrying on mining operation of bauxites which
is processed in a plant in Damanjodi in Koraput District for being used as raw
material for the aluminium smelter plant at Angul. For the aforesaid business,
the petitioner has captive power plants for generating electricity. The
petitioner made application for including certain goods in its certificate of
registration granted under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, as per Rules made
thereunder. Sales Tax Officer included some of the items but did not include
amongst others, computers and telecommunication and intercom equipments. No
reason was indicated or intimated by the Sales Tax Officer to the petitioner
as to why such goods were not included. Against such non-inclusion, the
petitioner approached the Commissioner in revision under Section 23 of the
would be necessary to be included in the certificate of registration before
finally deciding the question, the Sales Tax Officer ought to give an
opportunity to the applicant for explaining the nature of use in connection
with the manufacture or mining operation and in case explanation would not be
clear without demonstration he may visit the spot within his jurisdiction to
get a first-hand idea of the nature of use. When he visits the spot if
requested by the applicant, he shall prepare a memorandum and keep the same on
record. Whether he includes the item or not, he should keep the reasons on
record and in case of non-inclusion, furnish the reasons to the applicant when
sought for, so that the same can usefully be used while assailing the same in
higher statutory forums.
6\. Since no useful purpose would be served in dealing with the revisional
order on merit, we give liberty to the petitioner to make a fresh application
to the Sales Tax Officer within March 15, 1990 and on receipt of such
application, the Sales Tax Officer shall dispose of the same giving weight to
the aforesaid observations on or before May 31, 1990.
petitioner approached the Commissioner in revision under Section 23 of the
Orissa Sales Tax Act. The Commissioner having rejected the revision, the same
is assailed in the present writ application.
3\. Mr. B.K. Mohanty, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that
the petitioner essentially requires the computers, intercom and
telecommunication equipments to be included in the certificate of
registration. To our question he clarified that the petitioner now does not
require it for the period from 1982 till date and in case a direction is given
for inclusion of the same now for the future use, the petitioner's requirement
would be satisfied.
4\. Application for inclusion in the certificate of registration was made in
the year 1982 and revisional order was passed in 1983. Since then the writ
application is pending in this Court. No useful purpose would be served by
dealing with merit of such an application in the present writ application in
view of the clarification given by Mr. Mohanty.
5\. It is well-known that a machinery, equipment or other item of goods which
might not have satisfied the conditions for inclusion in a certificate of
registration, may become necessary at a later stage on account of advance in
technology, research or for reducing the cost of ultimate production. Keeping
the same in the background and the principle of inclusion in a certificate of
registration as laid down by the Supreme Court, application is to be
considered. It is not disputed that principle as laid down in [1965] 16 STC
563 (J.K. Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer)
governs the field even now. In the said decision, the Supreme Court observed :
"In our judgment if a process or activity is so integrally related to the
ultimate manufacture of goods so that without that process or activity
manufacture may, even if theoretically possible, be commercially inexpedient,
goods intended for use in the process or activity as specified in Rule 13 will
qualify for special treatment. This is not to say that every category of goods
'in connection with' manufacture of, or 'in relation to' manufacture, or which
facilitates the conduct of the business of manufacture will be included within
Rule 13. Attention in this connection may be invited to a judgment of this
Court in which it was held that vehicles used by a company (which mined ore
and turned out copper in carrying on activities as a miner and as a
manufacturer) fell within Rule 13, even if the vehicles were used merely for
removing ore from the mine to the factory, and finished goods from the factory
to the place of storage. Spare parts and accessories required for the
effective operation of those vehicles were also held to fall within Rule 13.
See Indian Copper Corporation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, C.A.
No. 1021 of 1963, decided on October 19, 1964 (reported in [1965] 16 STC 259
(SC) ; AIR 1965 SC 891)."
The aforesaid principle is to be applied to the facts and circumstances of
each case. Where an application is not clear as to how such category of goods
would be necessary to be included in the certificate of registration before
finally deciding the question, the Sales Tax Officer ought to give an
opportunity to the applicant for explaining the nature of use in connection
with the manufacture or mining operation and in case explanation would not be
clear without demonstration he may visit the spot within his jurisdiction to
get a first-hand idea of the nature of use. When he visits the spot if
requested by the applicant, he shall prepare a memorandum and keep the same on
record. Whether he includes the item or not, he should keep the reasons on
record and in case of non-inclusion, furnish the reasons to the applicant when
sought for, so that the same can usefully be used while assailing the same in
higher statutory forums.
6\. Since no useful purpose would be served in dealing with the revisional
order on merit, we give liberty to the petitioner to make a fresh application
to the Sales Tax Officer within March 15, 1990 and on receipt of such
application, the Sales Tax Officer shall dispose of the same giving weight to
the aforesaid observations on or before May 31, 1990.
7\. In the result, writ application is disposed of with the aforesaid
observations. No costs.
