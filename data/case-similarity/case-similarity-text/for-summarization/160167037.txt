This appeal by the assessee is preferred against the order of the DRP -1, New
Delhi dated 24.09.2015 framed u/s 144C(5) of the Income- tax Act, 1961
[hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short] pertaining to A.Y 2011-12.

2\. This is the second round of litigation. In the first round, the matter
travelled upto the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. Following substantial question
of law was admitted by the Hon'ble High Court:
> "Whether the ITAT erred in ordering a de novo determination of the Arms
> Length Price by the Transfer Pricing Officer upon a fresh benchmarking?
3\. The relevant findings of the Hon'ble High Court read as under:
> "17. Consequently, the question framed by this Court is answered in the
> affirmative by holding that the ITAT ought not have remanded the matter to
> the TPO for the de novo determination of the ALP of the international
> transactions in the various segments. This exercise should be performed by
> the ITAT itself. This is on the basis of the submission of the Assessee that
> all the details relevant for such determination are already available on
> record.
> 18\. The impugned order of the ITAT is accordingly set aside. The assessee's
> appeal ITA No. 6779/DEL/2015 for the concerned A.Y 2011-12 is restored to
> the file of the ITAT. The said appeal will be listed before it for
> directions on 21st August 2017".

12\. Apart from the fresh search, the TPO redrew the appellant- company's
segmental by :
> (i) treating the reimbursement of expenses received as part of profit and

> (ii) reallocation of certain expenses which were not actuals based on the
> revenue of each segment; &
> (iii) treating the provision/liabilities written back as non operative in

13\. Results of fresh segmental analysis resulted in the margins as under:
                 EDS        -     8.98%
                 FAS        -     21.57%
                 IT Infra   -     18.06%
14\. Further, the TPO did not allow the benefit of economic adjustments, i.e.,
working capital and risk, while computing the arms' length margins of the
respective segments of the company. The TPO also made an adjustment on account
of period of delay in receipt of payments from AEs. The TPO imputed an Indian
based interest at the  8 rate of 10.84% p.a. for the period of delay in
receipt of payments from AEs beyond 60 days.

16\. The appellant-company vehemently assailed the draft assessment order
before the DRP. The DRP, after considering the facts and detailed submissions
of the assessee, directed the TPO to exclude the  9 following comparables from
the final comparable set on account of functional dissimilarities:
> (i) Ashok Leyland Project Services Ltd.
> (ii) Bengal SREI Infrastructure Development Ltd.
> (iii) NTPC Electric Supply Company Ltd.
> (iv) Pallavan Transport Consultancy Services Ltd.
17\. In the FAS and IT infra support services, the DRP accepted the approach
and the comparable set considered by the TPO, though the working capital
adjustment was allowed by the DRP, but the risk adjustment for computing the
arm's length margin was denied. In so far as charging of interest is

19\. We will first take up EDS Segment.
SEGMENT I EDS SEGMENT
20\. The ld. counsel for the assessee strongly submitted that the following
comparables deserve to be excluded from the final comparables set:
(i) Kitco Ltd
(ii) TCE Consulting Engineering Ltd
(iii) Certification Engineering International Ltd
(iv) Global Procurement Consultants Limited
(v) IBI Chematur [Engineering & Consultancy Ltd]
(vi) Mitcon Consultancy & Engineering Services
(vii) REC Power Distribution Co. Ltd  13
(viii) RITES Limited
(ix) Usha Hydro Dynamics Ltd.
21\. We will take up each comparable one by one.
(i) KITCO LIMITED
22\. The profile of this company shows that it is a 100% Government owned
undertaking rendering services primarily to Central/State Government
undertaking and PSUs. Most of the clients or projects undertaken by this
company are either for state government or government run institutions.
Therefore, the majority revenue of this company comes from government /state
or centre run projects and the company derives benefit out of its parental
relation with the Government in getting contract and because of this, the
profit margins of this company cannot be said to be indicative of a free
market economy where the appellant company and others operate. For these
reasons, this company was excluded by the Tribunal in assessee's own case in
assessment year 2010-11 in ITA No. 1478/DEL/2015 wherein the Tribunal relied
upon the findings of the coordinate bench in the case of ThyssenKrupp
Industries India Private Limited ITA No. 6460/MUM/2012.  14
23\. The relevant findings given in the case of ThyssenKrupp Industries India
Private Limited and of the coordinate bench in assessee's own case read as
under:
> "We find it as undisputed that Engineers India Limited is a Government
> company. It has several segments which also include 'Turnkey project' page
> 700 of the paper book is a copy of annual report of Engineers India Limited
> on turnkey project. It can be seen that the revenue has arisen from
> completing paraxylene plant of IOCL and further that company is engaged in
> execution of other unit of IOCL's Panipat Naphtha cracker project. In our
> considered opinion' this case should not have been included in the list of
> final comparables for two reasons. First reason is that profit motive is not
> a relevant consideration in case of Government undertakings. Many Government
> Undertakings even operate on losses in furtherance of the social obligations
> of the government. The second reason is that Engineers India Limited earned
> income from turnkey project by successfully completing the project of IOCL
> and other Public Sector Undertakings. In that sense of the matter, the
> related party transactions are much more than the filter of 25%. We,
> therefore, order for the exclusion of this case from the list of
> comparables."
12.5 In the above ruling, the comparable M/s. Engineers India Limited was
rejected primarily on the ground that it was working for  15 government/public
sector undertakings and since the company also being a government owned
enterprise; the transactions tantamount to related party transactions. The
same is true for the said comparable as Kitco Ltd., transactions are primarily
with government owned enterprises. Applying the preposition laid down in the
case of M/s ThyssenKrupp Industries India Private Limited (supra), we hold
that Kitco Ltd., cannot be accepted as a comparable company. Hence the same is
directed to be eliminated."
24\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct to exclude KITCO from the final set of comparables.
(ii). TCE CONSULTING ENGINEERS LTD
25\. Profile of this company shows that it is involved in activities beyond
engineering design extending from concept to commissioning whereas the
assessee provides services as a captive unit to its overseas AEs. This company
was excluded from the set of comparables in assessee's own case in assessment
year 2010-11 in ITA No. 1478/DEL/2015.
16
26\. The relevant findings of the coordinate bench in assessee's own case
[supra] read as under:
> "The comparable company is involved in activities beyond engineering design.
> It is engaged in activities that extend from concept to commissioning.
> Whereas the assessee provides services as a captive unit to its overseas
> AEs. The diversified functions of this comparable company include pre-
> project activities, procurement assistance, project management,
> commissioning and coordination, inspection, construction and supervision.
> Further, there is no segmental accounting in the annual report of the
> Company which provides profitability, for the engineering design segment.
> Hence the same cannot be accepted as a comparable."
27\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct to exclude TCE Consulting Engineers Ltd from the final set of
comparables.
(iii). CERTIFICATION ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL LTD
28\. This company was also excluded by the Tribunal from the set of
comparables in assessee's own case in assessment year 2009-10 in ITA No.
882/DEL/2014.
17
29\. The relevant findings of the coordinate bench in assessee's own case
[supra] read as under:
> "32. On the basis of foregoing discussion, we have no hesitation to hold
> that the functions of assessee Bechtel India are quite dissimilar with CIEL
> which was wrongly taken by the TPO as a suitable comparable for benchmarking
> of impugned international transaction undertaken by the assessee during the
> relevant financial period. The functional dissimilarity as well as
> distinction in the geographical market in the light of foreign exchange
> fluctuation risk of the assessee company coupled with below 25% RPT
> undertaken by the CIEL, we, therefore, decline to agree with the conclusion
> of the AO/DRP/TPO that the CIEL is a suitable comparable for the purpose of
> proposed TP adjustment made by the authorities below. Functional
> dissimilarity and other aspects cannot be ignored and these factors clearly
> demonstrate that CIEL should not have been included in the final set of
> comparables for making transfer pricing adjustment pertaining to the
> impugned international transactions of the assessee company and we order to
> exclude the same from the final set of comparables. It is ordered
> accordingly."
30\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct to exclude Certification Engineering International Ltd from the final
set of comparables.
18
(iv) GLOBAL PROCUREMENT CONSULTANTS LTD. [GPCL]
31\. The profile of this company shows that GPCL has been promoted by the
Export-Import Bank of India as a private sector company in partnership with
leading corporate groups like RPG Industries, MECON, Tata Consulting
Engineers, Consulting Engineering R. L. Dalai & Co., Agricultural Finance
Corporation, RITES, WAPCOS, Kirloskar Consultants and Ion Exchange. GPCL acts
as the client's representative in taking on the total responsibility of
procurement related advisory services and inter-allied activities for projects
in India and abroad. With thorough knowledge of the guidelines and practices
stipulated by international funding agencies like the World Bank, African
Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, GPCL is capable of providing
to the project authorities, apt and appropriate advice and service in
procurement, strictly following the procedures and policies of multilateral
funding agencies and authorities. The company is registered with the World
Bank, African Development Bank and other financial institutions. The
procurement phase is the "key activity" in project cycle. GPCL monitors all
procurement activities including project management from concept to
commissioning, so as to ensure timely supply and delivery, quality control,
thorough inspection, effective cost control and adherence to re schedules. Our
expertise  19 will benefit the clients in getting an unbiased cost effective
and exclusive professional service, which is also environment friendly
financial institutions and project authorities who are particular on judicious
utilization of funds prefer independent procurement consultants like GPCL.
GPCL's consultancy services encompass: • Preparing and reviewing technical
specifications.
    •    Estimation of costs.
    •    Selection of vendors.
    •    Inspection and expediting.
    •    Quality control and time management.
All contractual aspects involved in procurement will also be handled by the
company, to ensure that the client's interests are protected. In addition to
core expertise, with technical back-up drawn from the shareholding partners,
who have specialization in different fields, GPCL will provide, services that
are time bound, cost effective ap optimal for the clients leveraging upon
knowledge of suppliers and vendors through a vast database, drawing upon its
familiarity with international trade and its access to infotech.  20
32\. A perusal of the aforementioned profile of the GPCL shows that the
company undertook valuation, consultancy and financial advisory assignments
which are not all linked with the services provided by the appellant company
to its AEs. The profile of a procurement company cannot be compared with the
profile of engineering designed and related company [appellant company].
Considering the financial profile of this company, in our considered view, it
is functionally dissimilar and, therefore, it cannot be accepted as a good
comparable. We, accordingly, direct the TPO/Assessing Officer to exclude GPCL
from the final set of comparables.
(v). IBI CHEMATURU [ENGINEERING AND CONSULTANCY] LTD.
33\. This company was excluded by the Tribunal from the set of comparables in
assessee's own case in assessment year 201011 in ITA No. 1478/DEL/2014.
29\. The relevant findings of the coordinate bench in assessee's own case
[supra] read as under:
21
> "12.7 The comparable Company is involved in activities beyond engineering
> design which assessee provides. Apart from detailed engineering, the
> comparable company, also provides project planning, management services,
> procurement assistance, project management, commissioning and coordination,
> inspection, construction and supervision etc. Further, there is no segmental
> accounting available in the annual report of the Company which provides
> profitability for the engineering design segment. The comparable company
> undertakes substantial R&D activities (R&D expense 5.41% of turnover) which
> is not a function performed by the assessee. Hence this company cannot be
> accepted as a comparable."
30 Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct to exclude IBI Chematur [Engineering and Consultancy] Ltd. from the
final set of comparables.
(vi) MITCON CONSULTANCY AND ENGINEERING SERVICES
31\. The profile of this company suggests that it provides technical
consultancy in various areas such as power division, energy and carbon service
division, banking and finance division. This company also renders vocational
trainings, IT trainings and laboratory services from  22 which it earns 40%
(approx.) of its revenue. From a screen shot of its profile, which is also at
page 113 of appeal set, shows that the Ministry of Environment and Forest,
Government of India extended its accreditation to the laboratory of this
company. It is further seen that this company has also exclusively completed
QCI-NABET accreditation process mandatory for EIA consultants. The company has
also executed environment monitoring assignments for TACO group, Volkswagon,
Kirloskar Brothers. This company is also engaged in the banking and finance,
entrepreneurship and vocational training. In our considered opinion, the
functional profile of this company is not at all comparable with the function
performed by the appellant company. Therefore, this company cannot be a good
comparable. We, accordingly, direct for exclusion of Mitcon Consultancy and
Engineering Services from the final set of comparables.
(vi). REC POWER DISTRIBUTION COMPANY LIMITED.
32\. This company is a wholly owned subsidiary of REC Ltd which is a Navratna
PSU and is engaged in the rural electrification projects. Being a Government
company, it cannot be considered a good comparable in the case of the
appellant company in the light of the  23 findings given by the co-ordinate
bench in the case of Thyssenkrupp Industries [supra]. We, accordingly, direct
the TPO/Assessing Officer for exclusion of REC Power Distribution Co, Ltd form
the final set of comparables.
(viii). RITES LIMITED
33\. This company was excluded by the Tribunal from the final set of
comparables in assessee's own case in assessment year 2004-05 and 2005-06 in
ITA No. 1476 & 1477/DEL/2015.
34\. The relevant findings of the coordinate bench in assessee's own case
[supra] read as under:
> "19. RITES Ltd., taken as comparable by DRP/TPO: The taxpayer filed detailed
> objections to the different orders against inclusion of aforesaid company as
> comparable. The crux of the same is lying at pages 73-75 of the appeal set.
> Major objection raised by the taxpayer is that the comparable company is
> engaged in providing services in the areas of engineering consultancy,
> traffic studies, exports of locomotives and maintenance of the locomotives,
> construction and project management for railway  24 track, electrification
> together with traffic and software consultancy assignments. More so, its
> income from non consultancy services is less than 75% and this filter is
> applied by the TPO himself. 20. On other hand, the appellant company is
> engaged in engineering design and drawing for various overseas AEs to
> support overseas offices on turnkey project execution basis. Similarly, the
> cost of export sales and supply services constitutes merely 35.86% of the

> maintenance of the locomotives, construction and project management for
> railway track, electrification together with traffic and software

> comparables."
35\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct the TPO/Assessing Officer for exclusion of RITES Ltd. from the final
set of comparables.
(ix). USHA HYDRO DYNAMICS LTD
36\. Profile of this company reveals that it is engaged in the business of
cleaning of various machines and equipment for various industries and is also
doing trading business whereas the business of the appellant company is
engineering design and related services. Two services are highly different and
cannot be said to be comparable to each other. More than 90% of its income is
from cleaning process. Being a functionally different company, it deserves to
be excluded from the final set of comparables. We order accordingly.  26
37\. Having excluded the aforesaid companies from the final set of
comparables, we find that the assessee has pleaded for inclusion of the
following companies in the final set of comparables which have been rejected
by the DRP-I.
(i) UB Engineering Ltd
(ii) Accuspeed Engineering Services India Ltd We will take up one by one.
(i) UB ENGINEERING LTD
38\. The profile of this company suggests that it is engaged in the operations
comprising of infrastructure and industrial projects which are directly
related to sectors like power generation and distribution, oil and gas,
petroleum, steel, cement fertilisers, etc. The company is also engaged in the
business of providing integrated design engineering, procurement, construction
and project management services for infrastructure and energy sector in terms
of construction contract. The company operates in two primary business
segments i.e. mechanical erection/engineering procurement and construction
[EPC] and EPC Electrical. From the profile of this company, it can be seen
that the functions performed during the year are totally different from the
functional profile of the appellant company. The DRP may have  27 included
this company as comparable in earlier assessment years, but the profile
suggests that it cannot be included as a good comparable. Therefore, we do not
find any error or infirmity in exclusion of this company and it will remain
excluded from the final set of comparables.
(ii) ACCUSPEED ENGINEERING SERVICES INDIA LTD
39\. We find that in assessment year 2010-11 also, this company was excluded
by the TPO but the Tribunal in ITA No. 1478/DEL/2015 included this company in
the final set of comparables. The finding of the Tribunal reads as under:
> "12.8 The ld. TPO in his order, has rejected the said comparable based on
> its functional profile, holding that the comparable company is involved in
> software services. The Ld.AR submitted that this comparable company is not
> into software services, instead, is engaged in providing consultancy
> activities in Engineering solutions and services covering design, detailed
> engineering, project construction & management. The ld.AR submitted that
> this comparable company provides engineering design solutions, and other
> related services, which is functionally similar to that of the assessee. We
> observe that the DRP has not given any reasons for rejecting this
> comparable. On examination of the papers on record, we are in agreement with
> 28 the submissions of the ld. AR. Hence we direct the A.O to include this
> company as a comparable."
40\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench [supra], we
direct the TPO/Assessing Officer for inclusion of Accuspeed Engineering
Services India Limited in the final set of comparables.
SEGMENT II FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SUPPORT SERVICES SEGMENT
41\. The assessee as a captive service provider is engaged in the provision of
services related to accounts payable management, payroll processing, invoice
processing and handling of related queries to its AEs.
42\. The functions performed by the assessee are broadly outlined as under:
> "Invoice processing: Under this process, scanned invoices raised on Bechtel
> Group Companies are provided to BIPL. The financial and accounting support
> services team at BIPL is responsible for uploading the information presented
> in the scanned invoices on the in-house database of the Bechtel Group. This
> team also  29 provides support in processing employee payroll processing and
> reimbursements for the BIPL employees.
Help desk support: Under this function, BIPL provides query management and
troubleshooting support to the Group Companies with respect to their supplier
management functions. Account Closing and Management Reporting: The function
supports general ledger accounts management, analysis and closure, reporting,
bank reconciliations, inter-office reconciliations and billing and collection
processes. Tax advisory services: This function involves providing advice to
the Group entities with respect to effective and efficient tax management.
Management of funds: Under this function, BIPL advises Bechtel group entities
on potential investment opportunities. It also monitors the performance of
investments with a view to protect the assets of BIPL as well as the group
entities. The ultimate decision making authority with respect to investments
lies with the group entities. It is also responsible for managing the finance,
insurance and treasury functions for some of the Bechtel group entities."
30
43\. An understanding of the assets employed and owned by BIPL will provides
and insight to the resources it deploys and their contribution to the
company's business processes/economic activities. BIPL utilises its office
premises, computers, communication facilities, other office equipment, etc for
the purpose of its business. BIPL does not own any significant intangibles.
The services provided by BIPL to its group entities have not given rise to any
significant intangibles. The risk assumed can be understood from the following

44\. However, when the matter was agitated before the DRP, the DRP observed
that "considering the facts and description of services given, it is clear
that the assessee is a high- end KPO in this segment". In our considered
opinion, considering the services provided by the assessee  32 in this
segment, it would be erroneous to conclude that the assessee is a high-end KPO
in this segment. Moreover, the FAR analysis given by the appellant was
accepted by the TPO in his order.
45\. Comparables finally selected by the TPO and confirmed by the DRP are as
under:
    No.   Company Name                                OP/TC %
    1     Accentia Technologies Ltd.                  29.18%

          Average                                     25.98%
46\. The counsel has strongly objected to the inclusion of the following
comparables as they are functionally dissimilar comparables:
    a)    Accentia Technologies Ltd
    b)   Eclerx
    Accentia    Services Limited
             Technologies  Limited
    c)   T C S E-serve Limited
47\. We will consider the objections raised by the ld. AR one by one.  33 I.
Accentia Technologies Limited [ATL]
48\. The business profile of this company shows that the promoters of Accentia
had initially ventured into ITES business through GeosoftTechnologies
(Trivandrum) Ltd. In the year 2006, the promoters took over a Mumbai listed
company named Company named HiTech Entertainment Limited and in the same year,
HiTech Entertainment Limited took over Geosoft and Iridium and the name HiTech
Entertainment was changed to AccentiaTechnologies Ltd. It would not be out of
place to mention that Geosoft Technologies started Product Division under the
name of Iridium. Products like Iridium Medical Transcription Automation
Software (iMTAS), Iridium Certified Home Based Medical Transcription (iCHMT),
Iridium Certified Medical Transcription (iCMT), Falcon-2000, FI HBPO
automation Software, iridium Real Time School (iRTS), iridium Accounts
Management System (iAMS), iridium Inventory Management System (ilMS), iridium
Payroll Management System (iPMS), iridium BusinessTranscription System (iBT),
iridium Hospital Management System (iHMS) are few of the products.
34
49\. Thus, it can be seen that this company has significant amount of brand,
IPR and goodwill. The appellant company on the other hand, is a simply captive
service provider, which provides services related to accounts payable
management, payrole, processing invoice processing and handling of related
queries to its AEs. ATL is not a good comparable. As can be seen from the
above, it is functionally dissimilar. Moreover, this company was rejected as a
comparable in assessee's own case in assessment year 2010-11 in ITA No.
1478/DEL/2015.
50\. The relevant findings of the co-ordinate bench read as under:
> "This company has been included by the ld.TPO as a comparable. Functionally,
> Accentia Technologies Ltd., is into development of software products for
> healthcare. It is submitted by the ld.AR that 17 ITA No. 1478/Del/2015
> Accentia Technologies Ltd is also engaged into diversified activities such
> as Knowledge Process outsourcing(KPO), Legal process outsourcing(LPO), Data
> process Outsourcing(DTO), high end software services. It is also submitted
> by the ld.AR that segmental information in respect of this company is not
> available. It has been further brought to our notice that this company has
> been rejected by the Ld.TPO in the earlier year. The company has also had
> business restructuring during the year under consideration thereby giving
> rise to extraordinary circumstances. For all these reasons we direct the
> Assessing Officer to exclude this company as a comparable."
35
51\. As the co-ordinate bench in the earlier year has rejected ATL as a good
comparable, we do not find any reason why the same should be considered this
year. We accordingly direct for exclusion of ATL from the final set of
comparables.
(ii) Eclerx Services Limited [ESL]
52\. Eclerx is a KPO engaged in providing data analytics, data solutions
services etc. The Hon'ble high court of Delhi in the case of Rampgreen
Solutions TS-387-HC-2015(DEL)-TP has held that it would be flawed to benchmark
IT enabled service provider using knowledge process outsourcing companies. We
find that the Tribunal Special Bench in the case of Maersk Global Centres
(India) Private Limited ITA No. 7466/Mum/2012 has held that this company is
rendering high- end services involving specialized knowledge and domain
expertise and was incomparable to the assessee company engaged in providing
low- end services to group customers.
53\. As mentioned elsewhere, the DRP has erroneously considered the assessee
as a KPO whereas the assessee, as pointed out hereinabove, is providing
service to its AEs as captive service provider engaged in the  36 provisions
of services related to accounts payable management, payroll, processing
invoice processing and handling of related queries to its AEs. In our
considered opinion, ESL is not a good comparable as it is functionally
dissimilar from the assessee company. We, accordingly, direct for exclusion of
ESL from the final set of comparables.
(III) TCS E-SERVE LIMITED [TCS]
54\. The business profile of this company shows that it undertakes, customer
service, transaction processes, collections, risk management, and analytics,
and has created a lot of applications which are in the nature of intellectual
property in terms of reconciliation software, fund transfers, etc. The company
also undertakes software testing and validation activities. Needless to
mention that this company is associated with TCS and TATA brand name. We find
that in A.Y 2010- 11, this company was rejected as a good comparable by the
Tribunal in assessee's own case in assessment year 2010-11 in ITA No.
1478/DEL/2015.
37
55\. The relevant findings of the co-ordinate bench read as under:
> "This company has been selected by the ld.TPO as a comparable. This company
> undertakes, customer service, transaction processes, collections, risk
> management, and analytics, and has created a lot of applications which are
> in the nature of intellectual property in terms of reconciliation software,
> fund transfers, etc. The company also undertakes software testing and
> validation activities. Possession of intellectual property rights has to be
> factored if such a company is to be taken as comparable. This cannot be done
> unless there is appropriate data. Further, from the TP study we observe
> that, this company is a wholly owned subsidiary of TCS E serve International
> Ltd. During the year under consideration, this company has made payments
> towards use of Tata brand. Consequentially use of the TCS brand has
> substantially increased the operating profits post acquisition. Hence we are
> of the opinion that this company cannot be taken as a comparable. We
> therefore direct to exclude this comparable."
56\. Considering the functional dissimilarities in the light of the findings
of the coordinate bench [supra], this company is not a good comparable. We,
therefore, direct for exclusion of TCS from the final set of comparables.

SEGMENT III IT INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT SERVICES SEGMENT
57\. The functions performed by BIPL under this segment are as under:
> "Functions performed by BIPL BIPL has set up an offshore centre at Gurgaon.
> Presently, BIPL has a team of 600 people approximately who are engaged in
> providing-IT infrastructure support services. The centre is used to monitor
> and manage various IT infrastructure components such as servers, networks,

enhancement of software. This involves routine development of the software for
use-within the Bechtel Group. Software development involves steps like
requirement analysis, testing, modification to the existing software and
maintenance and enhancement of the software.'
58\. The DRP has observed that the description of services given above makes
it clear that the assessee is a KPO and is also engaged in software
development. While deciding the issue under the segment financial accounting
and support services, we have categorically held that the appellant company is
not a high-end KPO service provider.
59\. Final set of comparables under this segment are as under:  41

60\. Before us, the ld. AR vehemently argued for exclusion of the following
comparables from the final set of comparables claiming that these comparables
are functionally dissimilar:
(i) Infosys Limited
(ii) Wipro Technology Services Limited
(iii) Acropetal Technologies Limited
(iv) Sankya Infotech Limited
(v) Sasken Communication Technologies Limited
(vi) E-Infochips India Private Limited
(vii) E-Zest Solutions Limited
61\. We will now consider these comparables one by one.
(i) INFOSYS LIMITED
62\. At the very outset, INFOSYS cannot be considered as a good comparable in
the case of the appellant company because its turnover  43 is over 1600 times
more than that of the appellant's. Brand profits and owns significant
intangibles. Moreover, it has significant expenditure on research &
development for developing new products and innovative technology. It also
incurs Significant advertisement and marketing expenditures resulting in non-
routine marketing intangibles. It owns branded / proprietary products like
Finacle, Infosys Actice Desk, Infosys iProwe, Infosys mConnect, thereby making
it diversified product portfolio product company. This company has been
rejected as a comparable in a series of judgments of the coordinate benches.
In our considered opinion, INFOSYS Ltd does not make a good comparable and
deserves to be excluded from the final set of comparables. We order
accordingly.
(II) WIPRO TECHNOLOGY SERVICES LTD [WTSL]
63\. Wipro Technology Services Limited ('the Company') was incorporated on 15
September 2004 as a subsidiary of Citicorp Banking Corporation. Pursuant to
the share purchase agreement dated 21 January 2009, all the shares of the
Company was purchased by Wipro Limited, which is the holding company of WTSL.
The activities comprise software related support services, primarily
information technology software solutions/maintenance and technology  44
infrastructure support services. The company is currently engaged in providing
software related support services, primarily information technology, software
solutions/maintenance and technology infrastructure support services to
Citigroup entities globally which is considered as one segment. Hence there
are no separate reportable segments as required by Accounting Standard 17 on
'Segment Reporting'. The transaction between WTS and Citi Group companies
falls within the ambit of section 92B of the Act. Therefore, its earning is
with a deemed AE and has related party transactions of 100% of sales. On the
given facts of this case, it does not pass the RPT/sales filter of 25% applied
by the TPO. This company was rejected as a comparable by the co-ordinate bench
in the case of Saxo India Pvt. Ltd ITA No. 6148/DEL/2015.
64\. The relevant findings of the co-ordinate bench read as under:
> "Adverting to the facts of the instant case, we find that Wipro Technology
> Services Ltd. earned a revenue from Master services agreement with Citigroup
> Inc. for the delivery of technology infrastructure services. This agreement
> was, in fact, executed between the assessee's AE, Wipro Ltd., and Citigroup
> Inc., a third person. This unfolds that the transaction of earning revenue
> from software development support and maintenance services by Wipro
> Technology Services Ltd., is an international transaction because of the
> application of section 92B(2) i.e.,  45 there exists a prior agreement in
> relation to such transaction between Citigroup Inc. (third person) and Wipro
> Ltd. (associated enterprise). In the light of this structure of transaction,
> it ceases to be uncontrolled transaction and, hence, Wipro Technology
> Services Ltd., disqualifies to become a comparable uncontrolled transaction
> for the purposes of inclusion in the final list of comparables under Rule
> 10B(1)(e)(ii). We, therefore, direct removal of this company from the list
> of comparables."
65\. Considering the functional profile of WTS in the light of observations
made by the co-ordinate bench [supra], we direct for removal of this company
from the final set of comparables.
(iii) Acropetal Technologies Limited [ATL]
66\. The TPO has applied an Employee Cost Filter, whereby the companies having
employee cost less than 25% of their total cost have been excluded. The
employee cost incurred by Acropetal Technologies Limited can be understood
from the following chart:
                     Particulars                 Amount
                                                 (in 1NR)
    Selling and Marketing expenses
    - Salaries                                  9,040,989
    - Contribution to PF                         564,552
    - Staff welfare expenses                     29,147
                                        46
    General administration expenses
    - Salaries                                11,996,581
    - Contribution to PF                       877,799
    - Staff welfare expenses                   128,000
    Software Development expenses
    - Salaries                                135,160,463
    - Contribution to PF                       3,851,751
    - Staff welfare expenses                   1,395,789
    Total Employee Cost                       163,045,071
    Total Operating Cost                      1,065,696,7
    Employee Cost ratio                           29
                                                15.30%
67\. We find that the DRP has simply confirmed the findings of the TPO by
making an observation that the assessee has not been able to controvert
detailed findings of the TPO in support of his decision on the comparables
selected. In the light of the above factual chart, we do not find any merit in
the observation of the DRP considering the fact that Acropetal Technologies
Limited fails the filter test and deserves to be deleted. We order
accordingly.
(iv) Sankya Infotech Ltd
68\. Profile of this company shows that it is engaged in the e learning
activities and training solutions and is engaged in the development of
simulation and virtual training products which are totally different  47 from
the functions performed by the appellant company under the IT Infra Support
Services Segment. On finding this dissimilarity in the functions, we do not
find this company to be a good comparable. We direct for exclusion of Sankya
Infotech Ltd from the final set of comparables.
(v) Sasken Communication Technologies Limited
69\. Profile of this company shows that it is engaged in rendering testing,
satellite communication and other different services and is also engaged
production of software products. This company has spent around 4.20% of its
sales on marketing and advertisement expenses. This company is significantly
engaged in Research and Development as is evident from Exhibit 1256 & 1259 of
the PB. Sasken was not considered as a good comparable IT Infra Support
Services Segment by the coordinate benches in the following cases:
(i) Saxo India Private Limitged vs ACIT (ITA No. 6148/Del/2015)
(ii) ION Trading India Pvt. Ltd. v/s ITO (ITA No. 1035/Del/2015)
(iii) Tibco Software (India) P. Ltd. v/s DCIT (ITA No. 94/PN/2014)
(iv) Motorola Solutions India Pvt. Ltd. v/s ACIT (48 Taxmann.com 248  48
70\. Considering the dissimilarities in the light of findings of the
coordinate benches, we direct for exclusion of Sasken Communication
Technologies Limited from the final set of comparables.
(vi) EINFOCHIPS INDIA PVT. LTD
71\. Profile of this company shows that it is providing diversified services
like application software; e-commerce; mobility; BI and visualisation;
firmware and system software; board design; ASIC / SOC / FPGA Services;
mechanical and industrial design. Segmental data is not available. Income
statement of this company shows that the Revenue from soft ware development is
around 74% of the total revenue and, therefore, fails to pass the service
revenue filter. On this ground itself, this company deserves to be excluded
from the final set of comparables.
(vii). E-ZEST SOLUTIONS LTD
72\. Annual report of E-Zest Solutions Pvt which is exhibited at pages 1364 to
1442 of the paper books shows that it is engaged into diversified services
like product engineering services / outsourced  49 product development
services - Includes product designing and development product feature
enhancement, product platform migration, software product testing, license
management, Enterprise application development which includes customer
relationship management, enterprise resource planning, business intelligence,
knowledge management etc. IT service includes global onsite/ offshore software
development, custom software development, software testing and Technology
expertise - Includes technology competency centers in relation to Microsoft
competency centre, Sun Java competency centre, Open Source competency centre,
cloud computing practice, mobility practice and BI practice. Because of these
highly diversified services, this company was not considered as a good
comparable for IT Infra Support Services by various coordinate benches to name
a few:
(i) 3DPLM Software Solutions Limited [IT (TP) A No. 1303/Bang/2012]
(ii) NXP Semi-conductors Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ACIT [IT(TP)A 1174/Bang/2011]
(iii) Hewlett- Packard (India) Software Operation P. Ltd vs. ACIT [TS-
446-ITAT-2015(Bang)TP]
(iv) Financial Objects Software (India) Pvt Ltd Vs ITO [TS-292-ITAT-
2015 (Bang)-TP]  50
(v) Mindteck (India) Ltd Vs ITO [TS-251-ITAT-2015 (Bang)-TP]
(vi) Symphony Services Pune (P) Ltd. v/s ITO ward 1(4), Pune [ITA No.
257(PN)/2013]
(vii) Mentor graphics India Pvt Ltd v DCIT [ITA no. 410/Del/2013)
73\. Since this company is functionally dissimilar and has been rejected by
the coordinate benches [supra] we direct for exclusion of this company from
the final set of comparables.
74\. In the light of specific directions in respect of the three segments as
discussed hereinabove, we direct the AO /TPO to recomputed the PLI.
75\. The next issue relates to economic adjustments on account of risk.
76\. We find that the lower authorities have not provided economic adjustments
on account of difference in risk profile of the appellant vis a vis comparable
companies. We find that the assessee is a captive service provider which gets
remunerated on cost plus model and hence insulated from key business risk,
while the comparable companies  51 operate as entrepreneur and are subject to
all the risks associated with conducting a business. We find that this claim
was also accepted by the Tribunal in assessee's own case in A.Y 2004-05 and
2005-06 in ITA Nos. 1476 & 1477/DEL/2015.
77\. Relevant findings of the coordinate bench in ITA No. 1476/DEL/2015 reads
as under:
> "23. Regarding ground No.2 read with ground No.1.6, Ld. A.R. has contended
> that TPO/DRP has erred in denying the adjustment of complete utilization as
> well as risk adjustment while working on average matching of comparables.
> Rule 10B(3) read with Rule 10B(1)(e) clarifies that appropriate adjustment
> should be made to eliminate material effect of difference between the
> international transaction and the comparable transaction to establish
> comparability. DRP in para 8.2.6 of the impugned order written its findings
> for denying the capital utilization adjustment as well as risk adjustment,
> which are as under:
> "8.2.6 With regard to the issue of adjustment sought on account of risk and
> idle capacity utilization, having gone through the taxpayer's submission and
> considering the facts and evidences on records and case laws relied upon
> both by the TPO and taxpayer in this regard, this DRP agrees that for the
> purpose of meaningful comparison, Transfer Pricing  52 provisions do
> prescribe that the "reasonable and accurate adjustments" be made only for
> the enhance comparability.
> But at the same time such data must be reliable and robust and there should
> be no scope for mechanical adjustments.
The Panel has carefully considered the facts of the case and the submissions
of the taxpayer. As per Rule 10B(2) and 10B(3) of Income Tax Rules, 1962,
Indian transfer pricing provisions prescribe only for "reasonable accurate
adjustment" and further adjustment to the margins of comparables can be made
only if they enhance comparability. But at the same time the data for the same
must be relevant reliable and. robust. Risk adjustment as a general rule
cannot be allowed unless it is clearly shown that the comparables had actually
undertaken such risk and how the same materially affected their margins. The
revised OECD guidelines of.2010 has also stated. in para 3.54 as under:-
"Ensuring the needed level of transparency of comparability adjustments may
depend upon the availability of an explanation of any adjustments performed
the reasons for the adjustments being considered appropriate how they were
calculated how they changed the results for each comparable and how the
adjustment improves 12 ITA No.1476/Del/2015 comparability. Issues regarding
documentation of comparability adjustments are discussed in Chapter V."  53
Even the various judicial decisions on the issue of adjustments and even OECD
guidelines, impresses upon time and again that the adjustment should be
"reasonable accurate adjustment".
From the above guidelines, it can be seen that unless it is shown that how the
risk adjustment would change the result of each comparable and how the same
would improve the comparability and unless adequate reasons are given for such
adjustments, no adjustment can be allowed to the taxpayer. In the present
case, except pointing out various risks, the taxpayer has not shown with
evidence as to whether each of the risk was actually undertaken or not by the
comparables and if so how these risks affected each of them and whether such
adjustment would improve the comparability. Further in respect of comparables
no data is 'made available to show at what capacity they are operating at and
what is the average strength of the employees on account of which capacity
adjustment should be carried out to improve the comparability analysis.
Mechanical adjustment cannot be made to the margins of the comparables without
knowing which risks were taken by the entity concerned and how its
profitability was affected. Probability of risk and certainty of risk are two
different aspects and cannot be equated for the purpose of adjustments. The
significant of risk depends on its economic significance, likelihood of its
realization and "predictability. All" these requires robust and reliable  54
data, both for the taxpayer" and the comparables in the absence of which risk
and capacity adjustments cannot be considered for enhancing comparability.
24\. Bare perusal of the findings returned by TPO/DRP reproduced above denying
the benefit of capital utilization adjustment and risk adjustment goes to
prove that the objection raised by the tax payer having been mechanically
disposed off without returning the specific findings as to how and under what
circumstances, the data brought on record is not reliable or robust. TPO/DRP
has neither declared the data brought on record by the taxpayer as 13 ITA
No.1476/Del/2015 unreliable nor they have injected fresh data to assess the
capital utilization adjustment and risk adjustment as claimed by the taxpayer.
A perusal of the discussion made by DRP regarding disallowance of utilization
adjustment and risk adjustment in para 8.2.6 further goes to prove that merely
academic reasons have been given to disallow the same. Case law relied upon by
the DRP is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case when
examined in the light of data brought on record by the taxpayer to decide the
issue in controversy. So, findings of DRP/TPO on this issue are liable to be
reversed. Consequently, Ground No.2 read with Ground No.1.6 are determined in
favour of the appellant for statistical purposes and the file is ordered to be
restored to the TPO to decide the matter afresh by passing speaking order
after providing opportunity of being heard to the parties."
55
78\. Respectfully following the findings of the coordinate bench, we direct
accordingly.
79\. Last issue relates to adjustment on account of receivables.
80\. This issue was decided in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue
by the coordinate bench in the assessee's own case for A.Y 2010-11 in ITA No.
1478/DEL/2015 and order of the Tribunal was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court
and Hon'ble Supreme Court in CA No. 4956 of 2017. In A.Y 2010-11, the
coordinate bench ash given specific findings that the assessee is debt free
company and it is not justifiable to presume that the borrowed funds have been
utilised to pass on the facility to its AEs. Respectfully following the
findings of the coordinate bench, we direct for deletion of adjustment on
account of receivables.
81\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on 20th August, 2018.
