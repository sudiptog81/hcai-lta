    IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI
           W. P. (C) 5220/2005 & CM APPLs 19889/10 (for delay),
           19888/2010 (for restoration)

                                                  Decision on: May 3, 2011
    UNITED BROTHERS                                                ..... Petitioner
                                     Through: Mr. Sushant Singh with
                                     Mr. P.C. Arya, Mr. Gautam Panjwani,
                                     Mr. Tejinder Singh, Mr. V.K. Sinha and
                                     Ms. Parveen, Advocates
                   versus
    AZIZ ULGHANI & ANR.                        ..... Respondents
                      Through: Mr. Hemant Singh with
                      Mr. Animesh Rastogi, Advocates,
                                     And
                   W. P. (C) 2007/2010 & CM APPLs 4027, 4028/2010
    AZIZ ULGHANI                                           ..... Petitioner
in Class 7 ought to be allowed.
21\. This Court also holds that there is no legal infirmity in the order of
the IPAB which dismissed the cancellation petition of UB for the grant of
registration in favour of AU for electrical flat iron in Class 9. The
cancellation petition is barred both by laches and acquiescence. The mark
'UNITED' is a weak one and the registrations already granted to the respective
parties can be allowed to continue on account of the long number of years
during which both AU and UB have used the mark for their respective goods
without there being deception and confusion in the minds of the consumers as
regards the origin of their respective goods i.e. electric flat irons and
pressure cookers.
22\. In the circumstances, neither the order dated 3rd December, 2004 passed
by the IPAB dismissing UB's application No. TRA No. 92/2004/TM/DEL (CO. No.
6/96) nor the order dated 28th January, 2010 of the IPAB dismissing the appeal
filed by AU TRA/177/2003/TM/DEL W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 16 of 17

W.P.(C) No. 5220 of 2005 For the reasons stated therein both applications are
allowed and W.P.(C) No. 5220 of 2005 is restored to file.
W.P. (C) No. 5220 of 2005 and W.P.(C) No. 2007 0f 2010 with CM Nos. 4027-28 of
2010
1\. W.P. (C) No. 5220 of 2005 is by M/s. United Brothers ('UB'), a partnership
firm engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of aluminium
halloware and other household utensils since 1957, under the trade mark
'UNITED'. UB challenges an order dated 3rd December, 2004 passed by the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board ('IPAB') dismissing its application No.
TRA No. 92/2004/TM/DEL (C.O. No. 6/96) under Sections 46 and 56 of the Trade
and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 ('TM Act 1958') for cancellation/removal of
registration No. 388765 in Class 9 in respect of electric flat iron, granted
for the mark 'UNITED' in favour of Respondent No. 1 Mr. Aziz Ulghani ('AU'),
the sole proprietor of M/s. United Electric Co. ('UEC').
2\. W.P. (C) No. 2007 of 2010 is by AU the sole proprietor of UEC. The  W.P.
(C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 2 of 17 said petition challenges an order dated
28th January, 2010 passed by the IPAB dismissing an appeal TRA/177/2003/TM/DEL
filed by AU against the order dated 7th December, 2000 of the Registrar of
Trade Marks allowing the opposition of UB to the Application No. 518071 filed
by AU for registration of the trade mark 'UNITED', the word, per se, in Class
7 in respect of mixer grinder, hair dryer (machine) and washing machine.
3\. UB claims that it has been using the trade mark 'UNITED' for manufacturing
and marketing of aluminium halloware and other household utensils since 1957.
It is stated that on account of extensive user, large scale advertising and
immense popularity, the products under the trade mark 'UNITED' are associated
by the purchasing public and the trade with the goods and business of UB
exclusively. It is stated that the trade mark 'UNITED' was adopted by UB from
its firm's name, and that UB had a unique goodwill and reputation in respect
of pressure cookers. It has enclosed with W.P. (C) No. 5220 of 2005 a
statement of sale figures as well as the advertisement expenses from 1971-72
to 2003-04. UB claims to have regularly exported pressure cookers under the
trade mark 'UNITED'. It is stated that UB holds registration under No. 274649
for the trade mark 'UNITED' claiming user since 15th October, 1957 in respect
of aluminium halloware, utensils for household use in Class 21. It also holds
registration No. 369826 claiming user since 1st April, 1957 associated with
the other registered trade mark 274649 for the trade mark 'UNITED' in respect
of  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 3 of 17 household, domestic utensils
and containers (not of precious metal or coats therewith), pressure cookers
(non-electrical), milk cans and soap cases (boxes), all being goods included
in Class 21. It is stated that the above trademarks have been renewed from
time to time and are still valid and subsisting on the Register of Trade
Marks.
4\. It is stated that UB came to know that AU got the trade mark 'UNITED'
registered under registration No. 388765 as of 14th April, 1982 in relation to
electric flat iron in Class 9. UB opposed the registration of AU bearing No.
518071 in Class 7 under opposition No. DEL-8511. UB also opposed another
application of AU bearing No. 5488524 advertised in the Trade Marks Journal
No. 1190 in Class 11 dated 16th November, 1984 at page 1190\. The main
objection was that while obtaining the registration No. 388765 in Class 9 in
relation to electric flat iron AU made false statements and concealed certain
material facts. The other ground was that the trade mark offended provisions
of Sections 9, 11 and 18 of the TM Act 1958.
5\. The findings of the IPAB in the impugned order dated 3 rd December, 2004
while dismissing the application of UB for rectification of trade mark under
registration No. 388765 in favour of AU were as under:
> (i) The date of registration of the impugned mark under registration No.
> 388765 was dated 14th April 1982 and UB's application for rectification was
> made on 14th February 1996. A period of more  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010
> Page 4 of 17 than seven years had elapsed since the registration was
> granted.
> (ii) The onus in terms of Section 32 of the TM Act, 1958 was on UB to show
> that the registration was obtained by committing fraud, or that it
> contravened any provision of Section 11 and suffered from non-
> distinctiveness of the mark at the commencement of the proceedings. UB
> failed to bring any evidence to substantiate any of the above grounds.
6\. In W.P. (C) No. 2007 of 2010 the facts are that UEC, of which AU is the
sole proprietor, filed an application on 6th October, 1989 for registration of
a trade mark 'UNITED' in Class 7 in respect of mixer, grinder, hair dryer
(machine) and washing machine. The said application was ordered to be
advertised by the Trade Mark Registry and accepted for registration in Trade
Mark Journal No. 1067 dated 16th November, 1993 at page 885. On 11th March,
1994 UB gave a notice of opposition to AU on several grounds. The principal
one was that the mark applied for was likely to cause confusion and deception
in the course of trade and therefore offended Section 11 (a) of the TM Act,
1958. Affidavits were filed in respect of applications as well as opposition
by the respective parties.
7\. The findings of the Assistant Registrar in the order dated 7 th December,
2000 allowing the opposition No. DEL-8511 of UB and refusing registration to
AU (UEC) under Application No. 518071 in Class 7 were as  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 &
2007/2010 Page 5 of 17 under:
> (i) The rival marks were identical to each other and therefore, the
> condition under Section 12 (1) of the TM Act was attracted.
> (ii) Items like mixer grinders of the applicants are used in the kitchen
> being household goods and these goods are sold on the same counter and in
> the same shops where goods like aluminium halloware, utensils for household
> use, including domestic utensils etc. are sold. The purchasers also belong
> to the same class. Therefore, in view of the nature of the goods and class
> of purchasers, the second requirement of Section 12 (1) of the TM Act, 1958
> also stood attracted.
> (iii) The likelihood of confusion or deception was inherent in the trade
> mark 'UNITED' itself. The consumers of the products of UB while coming
> across the applicant's (AU's) trade mark under the same trade mark 'UNITED'
> would be led to the impression that the goods sold by the latter are in fact
> those of UB. There was likelihood of confusion or deception. Consequently,
> Section 11 (a) of the TM Act, 1958 was also attracted.
> (iv) The mark applied for by UEC was identical to the registered trade mark
> of UB. It was likely to deceive or cause confusion. In the circumstances,
> UEC would not be permitted to claim to be the proprietors of the trade mark
> 'UNITED' in terms of Section 18 (1) of the TM Act, 1958.
8\. In dismissing the appeal filed by UEC by the impugned order dated 28th
W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 6 of 17 January, 2010, the IPAB held as
under:
> (i) By long and continuous use of the trade mark since 1957 UB have acquired
> reputation and goodwill among the public. If UEC was granted registration
> for the mark 'UNITED' the consumers would definitely associate the goods of
> UEC as those of UB. There was therefore every possibility of confusion and
> deception.
> (ii) When the marks are identical and the goods are of same description, the
> marks could not be registered since that would lead to dilution of the
> reputation of UB.
> (iii) The IPAB concurred with the findings of the Assistant Registrar that
> the goods of UEC and the goods of UB are household goods which are sold to
> the same class of purchasers. Since the rival marks are identical and the
> goods are of the same description, the application of UEC for registration
> could not be accepted.
> (iv) UEC which has been using the mark 'UNITED' since 1977 cannot claim to
> be the proprietor of the said trade mark and does not qualify for
> registration in terms of Section 18 (1) of the TM Act, 1958.
9\. Mr. Sushant Singh, learned counsel appearing for UB first submitted that
by the impugned order dated 3rd December, 2004 the IPAB dismissed the
rectification application of UB only on the ground that no evidence had been
placed on record to substantiate the contention that the mark 'UNITED' was
likely to cause confusion and deception. Relying on the decisions in Ciba
Limited v. M. Ramalingam AIR 1958 Bom 56 and L.D.  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 &
2007/2010 Page 7 of 17 Malhotra Industries v. Ropi Industries ILR 1976 Delhi
278, it is submitted that the IPAB had itself to decide, looking at the two
trademarks, whether there was likelihood of deception. That function could not
be discharged by a person in the witness box. While it was true that the
absence of any evidence of deception may be a material fact which the Court
may take into consideration, if the resemblance between the two marks was
clear and obvious, then it was the duty of the Court to remove from the
register a mark which was likely to cause deception.
10\. Mr. Sushant Singh further submitted that if the normal and fair user of
the mark upon a good gives rise to a likelihood of confusion and deception
then the rectification application ought to be straightaway allowed. It is
submitted that goods like pressure cookers ought to be considered as goods
sold under the same trade channel as mixers and grinders. Relying on the
decisions in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Limited AIR
1960 SC 142, Punjab Tractors Limited v. Pramod Kumar Garg 200 PTC 260 which
was affirmed by the Division Bench of this Court in Pramod Kumar Garg v.
Punjab Tractors Limited 2010 (42) PTC 633 (Del), it is submitted that in
particular the goods are purchased by the same class of consumers i.e. home
makers. Both the products are invariably sold in the same shop. It is
submitted that the Supreme Court in Vishnudas Trading v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco
Co. Ltd. 1996 (16) PTC 512 (SC), entered a caveat that the said judgment would
not prejudice cases of  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 8 of 17
infringement and passing off where there was a likelihood of confusion and
deception on the basis of commonality of trade channel. Relying on the
decision in Bajaj Electricals Limited v. Metal & Allied Products, Bombay 1988
PTC 133 (Bom) it is submitted that the mixer grinder and pressure cookers are
the goods of the same description and are sold in the same shop and therefore,
there is likelihood of confusion and deception. It is denied that the
rectification application filed by UB is barred by delay or laches. Further it
is submitted that the impugned order of the IPAB does not discuss the ground
of delay and acquiescence. This was raised for the first time by UEC in W.P.
(C) No. 2007 of 2010. Referring to the decision in Hindustan Pencils Limited
v. India Stationary Products Co. 1989 (9) PTC 61 (Del), it is submitted that
adoption of the mark 'UNITED' by UEC knowing that UB is using the said trade
mark was tainted from the very inception. In the circumstances, the fact of
subsequent user cannot operate in favour of UEC. Further a perusal of the
document appearing at page 198 of the paper book which is produced by UEC
itself shows that it has been using the trademark to sell the pressure cookers
to the distributors of UB. The mark adopted is also the same.
11\. Mr. Sushant Singh submitted that there was a difference between the
onuses of proof in opposition proceedings and rectification applications. A
reference is made to certain passages in his favour in Kerly's Law of Trade
Marks and Trade Names (14th Ed., Thomson & Sweet & Maxwell,  W.P. (C)
5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 9 of 17 pp. 271-272). Reference is made to the
decision in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satyadeo Gupta AIR 1963 SC 449. Lastly, it
is submitted that the trade mark 'UNITED' has been adopted by UB for more than
50 years and it has earned immense reputation and goodwill. A reference is
made to the decision in United Brothers v. Navin Kumar 2006 (32) PTC 661 (Del)
which impliedly departed from the earlier view of the learned Single Judge of
this Court in United Brothers v. United Traders 1997 (17) PTC 603 (Del). It is
submitted that the question of whether the opponent is manufacturing mixer
grinder or related goods for which the protection is sought becomes immaterial
in the context of likelihood or probability of confusion and deception. A
reference is made to the decision in Shri Dalip Chand Aggarwal v. M/s. Escorts
Limited, AIR 1981 Del 150.
12\. Appearing on behalf of AU, Mr. Hemant Singh, learned counsel submitted at
the outset that AU is the brother-in-law of Mr. M. Nawshah, the partner of UB.
AU has been trading under the name of UEC since 1974 to the knowledge of Mr.
Nawshah. He referred to the affidavit by way of evidence dated 3rd September,
2004 of AU in the cancellation petition TRA No. 92 of 2004. He also referred
to the fact that AU produced 29 original bill books of sale invoices for the
period 1974-75 in the proceedings in CO. No. 6 of 1996 in this Court. This was
unfortunately misplaced by the Registry of this Court and could not be looked
at by the IPAB. He also referred to the sales tax registration certificate and
challans since 1975 that  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 10 of 17 had
been placed on record.
13\. Mr. Hemant Singh next submitted that the IPAB had negatived the challenge
of UB to the registration granted to AU in Class 9 for electric flat iron
whereas it allowed the opposition filed by UB to the grant of registration to
AU in Class 7 for mixer grinder, hair dryer, washing machine etc. It is
submitted that UB's cancellation petition filed in 1996 was barred by laches
and acquiescence. Reliance is placed on the decision in Khoday Distilleries
Ltd. v. Scotch Whisky Association AIR 2008 SC 2737\. The registration had been
granted since 1982. UB had been aware of use of the trade mark 'UNITED' by AU,
the brother-in-law of Mr. Nawshah since 1974. The cancellation petition was
filed in 1996 since the relationship between the two brothers-in-law turned
sour.
14\. Mr. Hemant Singh submitted that no evidence was produced by UB either in
the opposition proceedings or in the cancellation proceedings to show that the
trade channel of the competing goods was the same. It was settled in various
judicial pronouncements that the goods could be considered to be of the same
description only if following parameters were fulfilled:
> (i) If the nature and composition of competing goods are same;
> (ii) If the competing goods are used for common purpose; and
> (iii) If the competing goods are sold through common trading channels.
W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 11 of 17
15\. Relying on the decision in Vishnudas v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. It
is submitted that smoking cigarettes and chewing tobacco were not goods of
same description, though it is common knowledge that they are sold at the same
shop. Reliance is placed on the decision in Eagle Potteries Private Limited v.
Eagle Flask Industries Pvt Ltd. AIR 1993 Bom 185. The more distinctive and
reputed the trade mark, the broader is the protection that it enjoys. It is
submitted that 'UNITED' was one of the most commonly used marks as was
evidenced by the telephone directory of Delhi for the year 1994. It showed
that innumerable traders used UNITED as part of their trading name. 'UNITED'
was therefore, a weak mark commonly used by the trade, and therefore enjoyed
narrow protection which must be limited to the goods for which UB have used it
i.e. pressure cookers and aluminium halloware utensils.
16\. Relying on the decision in Jugmug Electric & Radio Co. v. Telerad Private
Ltd. 13 (1977) DLT 315 it is submitted by Mr. Hemant Singh that a common trade
channel must be established by evidence. A common trade channel means a
channel, at one end of which are common manufacturers manufacturing competing
goods and on the other end are common distributors and dealers dealing in
competing goods. Reliance is placed on the decision in Beiersdorf A.G. v. Ajay
Sukhwani 2009 (39) PTC 38 (Del) and Raleigh International Trade Mark (2001)
RPC 11. The judgments in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products
Ltd. and Bajaj  W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 12 of 17 Electricals
Limited v. Metal & Allied Products, Bombay are sought to be distinguished on
facts. It is, accordingly, prayed that AU is entitled to retain his
registration of the trade mark 'UNITED' under application No. 388765 in Class
9 for electrical flat iron and that his application of trade mark 'UNITED'
under application No. 518071 in Class 7 for other electrical appliances such
as mixer grinder, hair dryer, washing machine ought to proceed for
registration.
17\. The issues that arise for consideration in the present petitions are:
> (a) Whether AU is entitled to registration of the trade mark 'UNITED' for
> mixer, grinder, hair dryer, washing machine etc. which, according to him,
> has no commonality of trade with pressure cookers and aluminium halloware in
> respect of which UB holds registration for the identical mark 'UNITED'?
> (b) Whether the trade mark 'UNITED' registered in favour of AU in Class 9
> for electrical flat iron is liable to be cancelled on the grounds urged by
> UB?
18\. The trade mark 'UNITED' is a word mark which by its very nature is
descriptive. 'UNITED' is undoubtedly a weak mark commonly used by the trade
and therefore enjoys narrow protection. Learned counsel for AU (UEC) is right
in his contention that the mark 'UNITED' is extensively used either as a
prefix or suffix or by itself by numerous traders. In other  W.P. (C)
5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 13 of 17 words, there is absolutely nothing
distinctive in the mark 'UNITED' whether by itself or in association with
goods which are sold under that trade mark. The mark 'UNITED' cannot enable
customers to recall any particular goods with which such mark is associated as
it is extensively used over a range of goods and services.
19\. The analysis of the orders passed by the Assistant Registrar and the IPAB
in these cases reveals that
(i) The parties are related to each other. In other words the sole proprietor
of UEC (AU) is the brother-in-law of the partner of M/s. United Brothers.
Therefore, each of them is definitely aware of the use of the trade mark
'UNITED' by UB since 1957. Likewise, UB was aware of the use by AU, proprietor
of UEC of the mark 'UNITED' since 1974.
(ii) Both parties have been able to co-exist with their respective marks in
their respective trades.
(iii) The fact is that UB applied for and was granted the registered mark
'UNITED' for pressure cookers with effect from 17 th December, 1980 and was,
therefore, prior user of the trade mark for pressure cookers. Till 1996 UB did
not oppose the registration granted in favour of UEC for the mark 'UNITED' for
electrical flat W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 14 of 17 iron which was
granted with effect from 14th April 1982. There is merit in the submission of
learned counsel for UEC that the cancellation petition filed by UB more than
14 years after 1996 was barred by the principles of laches and acquiescence.
The observations in Khoday Distillery v. Scotch Whisky Association are
sufficient to negative the challenge of UB to the grant of registration of
trade mark 'UNITED' in favour of AU (UEC) in Class 9 for electrical flat iron.
(iv) The application by AU for registration of the mark 'UNITED' mixer,
grinder, hair dryer, washing machine etc. was rightly rejected by the
Assistant Registrar by an order dated 7 th December 2000 on the ground that
there was likelihood of confusion, deception and commonality of trade. It
rightly held that the pressure cookers and mixer grinders and even washing
machines are sold in the same shops dealing with household appliances. Going
on the observations of the Bombay High Court in Bajaj Electricals v. Metal &
Allied Products, Bombay, it is not difficult to imagine that these goods are
sold in the same shop. There is absolutely nothing distinguishing the mark
used by UEC from use of the same mark by UB. The mark is not even used along
with prefix or suffix which could distinguish one from the other.
W.P. (C) 5220/2005 & 2007/2010 Page 15 of 17
20\. For the above reasons, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the
order of either the Assistant Registrar or the IPAB holding that there is
likelihood of confusion or deception in granting registration of the trade
mark 'UNITED' in respect of mixer, grinder, hair dryer, washing machine in
favour of AU. This Court concurs with the view that the opposition by UB to
the grant of registration of the mark 'UNITED' in favour of AU for the goods
in Class 7 ought to be allowed.
21\. This Court also holds that there is no legal infirmity in the order of
the IPAB which dismissed the cancellation petition of UB for the grant of
registration in favour of AU for electrical flat iron in Class 9. The
cancellation petition is barred both by laches and acquiescence. The mark
'UNITED' is a weak one and the registrations already granted to the respective
parties can be allowed to continue on account of the long number of years
during which both AU and UB have used the mark for their respective goods
without there being deception and confusion in the minds of the consumers as
regards the origin of their respective goods i.e. electric flat irons and
pressure cookers.

21\. This Court also holds that there is no legal infirmity in the order of
the IPAB which dismissed the cancellation petition of UB for the grant of
registration in favour of AU for electrical flat iron in Class 9. The
cancellation petition is barred both by laches and acquiescence. The mark
'UNITED' is a weak one and the registrations already granted to the respective
parties can be allowed to continue on account of the long number of years
during which both AU and UB have used the mark for their respective goods
without there being deception and confusion in the minds of the consumers as
regards the origin of their respective goods i.e. electric flat irons and
pressure cookers.
