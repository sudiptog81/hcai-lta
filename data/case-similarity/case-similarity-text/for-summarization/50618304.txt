order of this Tribunal wherein, issues were set aside to file of DRP/AO, vide
order dated 14.12.2012 in ITA No.2889/Del/2010 by making following
observations in para 7:
"If we look at the order of Ld.DRP extracted (supra) in the light of above
proposition, it will reveal that DRP has not applied its mind. The assessee
had filed objections running into several pages and not a single objection has
been discussed by the Ld.DRP. Therefore, we  2 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07

set aside the order of Ld.DRP and remit the issue back to the file of Ld.DRP
for re-adjudication."
1.2. Post the set aside by this Tribunal, DRP passed the order subsequent to
which Ld.AO vide order dated 30/04/14 passed impugned order against which
assessee filed appeal on following grounds of appeal:
A.Y. 2006-07 (Assessee's appeal)
1\. That assessing officer erred on facts and in law in completing the
assessment under section 144C read with section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act
(the Act) at an income of Rs. 13,39,58,727 as against the returned income of
Rs.4,18,18,258.
2\. That the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in making addition to
the income of the appellant to the extent of Rs. 9,10,91,932 on account of the
alleged difference in the arm's length price of international transactions
resulting from the advertisement, marketing and sales promotion expenses
(hereinafter referred to as 'the AMP expenses') incurred by the appellant on
the basis of the order passed by the TPO under section 92CA(3) of the Act.
2.1. That the assessing officer/DRP erred on facts and in law in not
appreciating that expenditure on advertisement and brand promotion,
unilaterally incurred by the appellant, could not be regarded as a
'transaction' in the absence of any understanding / arrangement between the
appellant and the associated enterprise.
2.2. The Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP)/TPO erred on facts and in law in not
holding that the Indian company had incurred expenditure on advertisement of
the products in India and merely because the AMP expenses incurred by the
taxpayer, were proportionately higher than those incurred by comparable cases
taken by the TPO, did not  3 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12
and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing
P Ltd.
lead to the inference of "transaction" between the taxpayer and the foreign AE
for creating marketing intangibles on behalf of the later.
2.3. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the only
Transfer Pricing adjustment permitted by Chapter X of the Act was in respect
of the difference between the arm's length price (ALP) and the contract or
declared price, but the said provision could not be invoked to determine the
'quantum' / extent of business expenditure.
2.4. The DRP erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the Transfer
Pricing adjustment sought to be made by the TPO in the present case was a mere
quantitative adjustment, on the footing that the appellant had incurred
excessive amount of AMP expenditure and consequently that such Transfer
Pricing adjustment was not at all permitted or authorized by Chapter X of the
Act.
2.5. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in holding that expenditure
incurred by the appellant which incidentally resulted in brand building for
the foreign AE, was a transaction of creating and improving marketing
intangibles for and on behalf of its foreign AE and further that such a
transaction was in the nature of provision of a service by the appellant to
the AE.
2.6. That the DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in holding that AMP expenses
incurred by the appellant resulted in promotion of brand owned by the
associated enterprise, thereby creating marketing intangibles whose ultimate
benefit inured to the associated enterprise.
2.7. That TPO / DRP erred on facts and in law by questioning the commercial
expediency of AMP expenditure incurred by the appellant and assuming that
benefit has accrued to AE on account of AMP expenses incurred by the appellant
in India.
2.8. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the
advertisement and marketing expenses were incurred by the  4 ITA
No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA
29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
appellant wholly and exclusively for purposes of its business and not on
behalf of or for the benefit of the AE; any benefit to the AE being only
incidental.
2.9. That the DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that the
characterization of the appellant being that of a full fledged manufacturer
and / or distributor performing all functions and bearing all risks, is the
sole beneficiary of the AMP expenditure incurred by it, justified the conduct
of the appellant in incurring and bearing the cost of AMP expenditure.
2.10. Without prejudice, TPO/DRP erred on facts and in law in not appreciating
that even if marketing intangible has been created then the appellant is the
economic owner of the benefit of such intangible.
2.11. That the DRP erred on facts and in law by holding that incurring of AMP
expenses in India by the appellant is excessive being over and above the
commission paid to aSiS Enterprise, an associated enterprise, for providing
marketing services at the rate of 8.25% of the value of imported goods.
2.12. That the DRP erred on facts and in law in allegedly concluding that the
marketing plan of the taxpayer is identified by the AE and reviewed by the AE
merely on the basis that the appellant is making payment of commission on the
marketing services provided to aSiS Limited.
2.13. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in applying Bright Line Test
("BLT") for computing adjustment on account of expenditure on advertisement
and brand promotion expenses, without appreciating that in absence of specific
provision in the Transfer Pricing statutory provisions in India., adjustment
on account of the arm's length price of the advertisement and brand promotion
expenses could not be made.
2.14. The DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not appreciating that  5 ITA
No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA
29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
such a Transfer Pricing adjustment cannot at all be made in law without
determining the Arm's Length Price ("ALP") by applying one of the methods
specified in section 92C of the Act. 2.15. That the DRP erred on facts and in
law in holding that, "bright line is a line drawn within the overall amount of
AMP expenses incurred for the normal business of the assessee and the
remaining amount on the other side is the value of the international
transaction representing the amount of AMP expenses incurred for and on behalf
of the foreign AE towards creating its marketing intangible". 2.16. Without
prejudice that the assessing officer erred on facts and in law in ignoring the
fact that, since the appellant earns return commensurate with other brand
owners, the appellant is adequately compensated for its functions and AMP
expenses. 2.17. Without prejudice that the assessing officer erred on facts
and in law in considering selling and distribution expenses amounting to Rs
12.00,57,999 for the purpose of calculating alleged AMP expenditure of the
appellant.
2.18. Without prejudice that the DRPTPO erred on facts and in law in not
following the principle laid down by the Special Bench in case of LG
Electronics Private Limited of excluding selling and distribution expenses
amounting to Rs 12,00,57,999 while computing the alleged AMP adjustment of the
appellant.
2.19. Without prejudice that the DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law in not
appreciating that the associated enterprise has also incurred AMP expenditure
from which the appellant has derived benefit and a corresponding reimbursement
of AMP expenditure should be made by the appellant to the associated
enterprise. 2.20. Without prejudice that the DRP/TPO erred on facts and in law
in not considering appropriate set of comparables for undertaking benchmarking
analysis of the alleged international transaction arising out of AMP
expenditure incurred by the appellant. 2.21. Without prejudice that the
assessing officer/ DRP erred on facts  6 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA
2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas

and in law in considering the following companies as comparable for
benchmarking advertisement and publicity expenses, without appreciating that
product similarity is essential for benchmarking AMP expenses:

             Arintex Global Limited       0.59%

             Mean                         3.60%
2.22. Without prejudice that the assessing officer/ DRP erred on facts and in
law in not considering the fresh search of comparable companies as per the
criteria laid down by the Special Bench of the Tribunal in LG's case,
submitted by the appellant as additional evidence.
2.23. That the DRP erred on facts and in law in holding that the DRP cannot
become a forum for raising items and comparables which were not before the
AO/TPO lest it becomes a forum for thrashing out the primary facts.
2.24. That the assessing officer /DRP erred in not appreciating that no
royalty is being paid by the appellant for the use of brand name Adidas'.
3\. That the assessing officer / DRP erred on facts and law in making transfer
pricing adjustment amounting to Rs. 10,48,537 in relation to international
transaction of exports of goods made by the appellant to its AE.

3.1. The DRP erred on facts and in law in upholding the Transfer Pricing

export of goods allegedly on the ground that the appellant did not follow
uniform approach for benchmarking of international transaction.

C.O. 85/Del/2013 A.Y. 2007-08 (Assessee's Cross Objection)
1\. That the Ld.CIT(A) grossly erred on facts and in law, in confirming the
decision of TPO, holding AMP expenditure incurred by the assessee to be an
international transaction within the meaning of Section 92B of Income Tax Act.
2\. That, the Ld. CIT (A) having held that assessee to be "A high risk
distributor/de facto manufacturer", and having rejected the case of TPO and

given by the cross objector assessee holding that the transactions relating to

the parent company AE for the period .

14). The appellant craves for grant of permission to add, alter and delete any
ground of objection at or any time during the hearing."
2\. Both parties submitted that facts and circumstances of these appeals are
similar and issues to be decided are common. We are therefore deciding these
appeals by way of common order.
3\. Brief facts of case are as under:
Ld.Counsel submitted that the assessee is subsidiary company of Adidas Saloman
AG (AAG). The assessee engages third party contract manufacturers in India who
manufacture goods on basis of design and drawings provided by assessee. Goods
are manufactured by contract manufacturers under instructions and directions
of assessee. Assessee also undertakes distribution of goods imported from
Associated Enterprises. Assessee operates both, as a full risk bearing
distributor and manufacturer in Indian market.

3.1. Ld.TPO proceeded to undertake bench marking analysis of advertisement,
marketing and sales promotion (AMP) expenses aggregating to Rs.12,00,57,999/-,
by applying Bright Line Test. Ld.TPO held that, AMP expenses to that extent
were incurred for creating marketing intangible of Adidas brand, which
belonged to Associated Enterprise (AE) and, therefore, requires compensation
along with mark-up for brand promotion services, for applying Bright Line
Test. Ld.TPO compared AMP expenditure incurred by assessee with an average AMP
expenditure of following comparables:
    Sl.No.   Name of the Company                              AMP/Sales Ratio (%)
    1.       Arintex Global Ltd.                              0.59
    2.       Bharitya Global Marketing Ltd.                   4.24
    3.       Brandhouse Retails Ltd.                          2.01
    4.       Century Knitters (India) Ltd.                    0
    5.       Keygien Global Ltd.                              3.29
    6.       Pokama Fashions Ltd.                             5.57
             Arithmetic Mean                                  2.62
3.2. Ld. TPO thus was of opinion that AMP expenses of sales in case of
assessee was at 8.43% which was higher than average AMP expenses incurred by
comparables, thereby making an adjustment of difference which resulted in
creation of marketing intangibles on account of promotion and development of
brand "Adidas" legally owned by Associated Enterprise.

3.3. Ld.TPO thus held AMP expenditure to be an international transaction
within the meaning of section 90 2B (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act).
4\. Aggrieved by order of Ld. AO, assessee is in appeal before us now.
5\. At the outset, Ld.Counsel submitted that Ground No. 1 raised by assessee
is general in nature, and therefore do not require any adjudication.
Accordingly the same is dismissed.
6\. Ground No. 2 to 2.29 have been raised against adjustment made by Ld.AO on
account of alleged excessive AMP expenses amounting to Rs.243.85 crores. It
has been submitted by Ld.Counsel that said issue now stands squarely covered
in case of Whirlpool India Ltd. Vs. DCIT reported in (2014) 42 taxmann.com
553, which is upheld by Hon'ble Delhi High Court reported in (2015) 64
taxmann.com 324 .
At this juncture, Ld.Sr.DR submitted that against order of Hon'ble Delhi High
Court, revenue preferred appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court which is pending
for final hearing. He submitted that till disposal of matter by Hon'ble
Supreme Court, issue may be kept in abeyance.
7\. We have considered rival contentions of both sides in light of records and
orders passed on this issue by Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal as well as
Hon'ble Delhi High Court. 7.1. From records placed before us, it is observed
that, undisputedly Ld.TPO proposed adjustment on account of AMP expenses by
applying Bright Line Test. It is observed that Ld.TPO as  16 ITA
No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA
29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
well as DRP treated AMP expenses as international transaction by applying
ratio laid down by Special Bench decision of this Tribunal in case of LG
Electronics India Pvt. Ltd., vs. ACIT reported in (2013) 29 Taxmann.com 300,
which stands over ruled by decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of
Sony Ericson India Pvt.Ltd vs. CIT reported in (2015) 55 Taxmann.com 240.
Hon'ble Court while deciding Sony Ericson India Pvt.Ltd (supra) categorically
held that Bright Line Test is not an appropriate yardstick for determining
existence of an international transaction for calculating arm's length price.
7.2. Hon'ble Delhi High Court while deciding question of law raised for
Assessment Year 2008-09 held as under:
"Conclusion
47\. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that as far as
the present appeals are concerned, the Revenue has been unable to demonstrate
by some tangible material that there is an international transaction involving
AMP expenses between WOIL and Whirlpool USA. In the absence of that first
step, the question of determining the ALP of such a transaction does not
arise. In any event, in the absence of a machinery provision it would be
hazardous for any TPO to proceed to determine the ALP of such a transaction
since BLT has been negatived by this Court as a valid method of determining
the existence of an international transaction and thereafter its ALP.
48\. Question (i) in the Assessee's appeal viz., "Was there an international
transaction between WOIL and its AE involving the AMP expenses within the
meaning of Section 92B of the Act read with Section 92F(v) of the Act?" is
answered in the negative, i.e., in favour of the Assessee and against the
Revenue. Consequently Question (ii) in the Assessee's appeal is not required
to be answered. Further, the only question framed in the Revenue's Appeal
viz., "Whether the ITAT erred in deleting the addition of Rs. 180,73,10,769
made by the AO/TPO on account of AMP expenses under Section 37 of the Act?" is
17 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY
2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
answered in the negative, i.e. in favour of the Assessee and against the
Revenue.
49\. The impugned order of the ITAT and the corresponding orders of the DRP
and the TPO, on the above issues are hereby set aside. The appeal of the
Assessee, ITA No. 228 of 2015 is allowed and the appeal of the Revenue, ITA
No. 610 of 2014 is dismissed in the above terms, but in the circumstances with
no orders as to costs."
7.3. On perusal of orders passed by Ld.TPO/AO/DRP for year under
consideration, it is observed that AMP expenditure has been considered to be
international transaction by applying Bright Line Test, whereby Ld.TPO
proposed an adjustment of 243.8 crores. 7.4. Ld.Sr.DR preferred adjournment
application on the ground that issue involved in present appeal is in respect
of AMP adjustment. He submitted that consistent stand has been taken by
revenue before this Tribunal to request for adjournment in all appeals, where
AMP adjustment has been disputed by either parties on ground that Hon'ble
Supreme Court is seized with the matter. 7.5. During course of argument
Ld.Sr.DR sought permission from the Bench to file written submission regarding
issues raised by assessee which was granted. Accordingly, on 10/01/2019 a
detailed written submission has been filed by revenue in respect of issues
raised by assessee for all years under consideration which is taken on record.
7.6. Plea taken by revenue in written submission to justify AMP adjustment
proposed by Ld.TPO that assessee has been working for benefit of foreign AE
and deserves suitable remuneration. Heavy reliance has been placed by Ld.Sr.DR
on BEPS Guidelines, provided  18 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA
2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas
India Marketing P Ltd.
for Transfer Pricing of intangibles, under Action Plan 8-10 of GE 20/OECD BEPS
project in support of adjustment. 7.7. It has further been alleged by Ld.Sr.DR
that, there is mutual agreement/arrangement between assessee and its AE, for
discharge of function of marketing and market development in addition to
agreement/arrangement for sale and distribution of goods purchased from its
AE, for which cost has been borne by AE. Ld.TPO has also rejected claim that
assessee is a full risk bearing manufacturer/distributor, as there is no
supporting ground for the same.
8\. In our considered opinion, since basis on which adjustment has been made
being Bright Line Test itself has been rejected by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
case of Sony Ericson India P.Ltd. (supra) and no further interference is
called for at this stage. Further reliance placed by Ld.Sr.DR on BEPS
guidelines and Action Plan 8-10 cannot be applied as the same is yet to be
implemented. We, therefore, reject application of Bright Line Test,
respectfully following decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of Soney
Ericson India P Ltd. (supra).
8.1. On perusal of TP order, at page 6, it is observed that Ld.TPO made an
effort to analyse whether AMP expenditure is an international transaction or
not. It is very interesting to note that Ld.TPO observes that assessee has
been licensed the brand "Adidas" by its domestic AE (Adidas India Pvt. Ltd).
He also reproduces relevant extract from the agreement, wherein it is recorded
that Adidas India Pvt. Limited is the exclusive owner of  19 ITA
No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA
29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
trademark "Adidas" and enjoys all proprietary rights related thereto. It is
observed that relevant clauses reproduced in Transfer Pricing order is an
extract from the trademark agreement dated 14/02/1997. Further in para 5.2 at
page 7 of TPO order Ld.TPO records as under:
" 5.2. ........ A closer examination of the facts of the case has revealed
that assessee's case is in fact no different from other cases wherein the
Indian entity licenses the brand directly from its overseas AE. In assessee's
case, a domestic AE (Adidas India private limited) has been interposed merely
as a planning device and with no economic substance. ...........
5.3. The assessee was asked to furnish the audited financial statement of its
immediate holding company in India with Adidas India private limited. On
perusal of the same, it is quite clear that the holding company is just a
shell company that does nothing else apart from holding investment in the
assessee. ........"
8.1.1. If we appreciate implication by Ld.TPO, then since holding company has
been opined by Ld.TPO to be shell company, in same breath, assessee would also
amount to be shell company being its holding company. It is observed that
Ld.TPO loosely used phrase 'lifting of corporate Veil', without understanding
attributes that needs to be established by way of cogent materials/evidences
to prove, a benefit of revenue having accrued to assessee.

ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
8.1.2. We don't deny that there would be incidental benefit to foreign AE,
being, Adidas-Saloman AG, which is ultimate parent of assessee. However,
expenditure towards advertisement and marketing incurred by assessee in India
is mainly for its own benefit to market products manufactured by it in India.
Main purpose of incurring of such huge AMP expenses has largely benefited
assessee in India, with an incidental benefit arising to foreign AE. Unless
Ld.TPO can establish direct benefit accruing to foreign AE, it is very
difficult to accept existence of international transaction, under present
facts of the case. We rely upon decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case
of Sony Ericson Mobile Communication India Pvt.Ltd (supra) in support of
aforestated observations.
8.2. Further it has been submitted by both sides that facts and circumstances
in present appeal are no manner different with that of Maruti Suzuki Inida
Ltd. Reported in 381 ITR 117; and Soney Ericson Mobile Communications (supra),
wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that existence of international
transaction must be established de hors the Bright Line Test before
undertaking bench marking of AMP expenses. We therefore respectfully follow
the view taken by this Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Sony Ericson Mobile
Communications (supra), and delete adjustment made in respect of AMP expenses.
8.3. However, we appreciate the concern raised by Ld.Sr.DR that decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court will be binding upon assessee as well as revenue.

"19. After considering the legal position as discussed in the preceding
paragraphs, we are of the considered opinion that the ALP of an international
transaction involving AMP expenses, the adjustment made by the TPO/DRP/AO is
not sustainable in the eyes of law. At the same time, we cannot ignore the
submission of the learned DR that the matter is pending before Hon'ble Apex
Court and the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court would be binding upon all the
authorities. In view of the above, we set aside the orders of authorities
below and restore the matter to the file of the Assessing Officer. We hold
that as per the facts of the case and the legal position as of now and
discussed above in this order, the adjustment made by the TPO/DRP/AO in
respect of AMP expenses is not sustainable. However, if the above decisions of
Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court which is under consideration before the
Hon'ble Apex Court is modified or reversed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, then the
Assessing Officer would pass the order afresh considering the decision of
Hon'ble Apex Court. In those circumstances, he will also allow opportunity of
being heard to the assessee."
Accordingly Grounds 2 to 2.24 stand allowed for statistical purposes.
9\. Ground No. 3-3.3 have been raised by assessee against Transfer Pricing
adjustment with relation to export of goods.
10\. Ld.Counsel submitted that assessee had to minimise excess stock and had
to sell off outdated stock without dilutes being its stand in the domestic
market. As assessee could not sell the same by offering additional discount
and clearing through discount shop,  22 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA
2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas
India Marketing P Ltd.
assessee exported the goods to AE Adidas Solomon Sourcing Ltd, Hong Kong.
Ld.Counsel submitted that assessee used CUP method for benchmarking the
transaction and produced copies of invoices of the products further sold by AE
to Bonnie Blair. Ld.Counsel submitted that AE made gross profit of 23% on the
transaction.
10.1. He submitted that it is policy of group to minimise excess stock and to
sell off outdated stock at reasonable margins by following any of the
following process:
 One is to clear such stock in domestic market, by way of offering additional
discounts to local customers;  another one is clearing stock through own
factory outlets;  if the two avenues do not suffice then regional head office
offers assistance as the AE avails of a couple of dedicated clearance
customers such as SIMO and Bonnie Blair who are able to purchase, sell and
market said surplus stock in a way that the relevant domestic market do not
unnecessarily suffer from stock clearance activities.
10.2. Ld.Counsel submitted that these clearance customers usually have a
customer base in underdeveloped countries such as Cambodia or Africa where the
stock can be dropped without adverse effect on market which are considered
more important from a strategic perspective such as India.
10.3. On a question being put up to Ld.Counsel regarding why the goods are not
sold directly by assessee to the third parties, it  23 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY
2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY
2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
was submitted by Ld.Counsel that assessee has distribution rights only within
territory of India which includes Nepal and therefore assessee could neither
directly sell nor it has a customer relationship with Bonnie Blair or SIMO.
10.4. Ld.Counsel further submitted that this issue stands squarely covered by
order of this Tribunal in assessee's own case for assessment year 2005-06 in
ITA No. 3922/Del/2011
11\. On the contrary LdCIT,DR placed reliance upon order passed by authorities
below.
12\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the
records placed before us.
13\. It has been submitted that assessee follows consistent approach in
dealing with slow-moving stock which is in consonance with company policy as
has been explained by Ld.Counsel in his argument. Nothing on record has been
placed before us by Ld.Sr.DR or by authorities below pointing out any fault or
error in the company policy of disposing off seconded goods. Moreover assessee
has discretion to decide how its business needs to be conducted. It is
observed that Ld.TPO proposed adjustment as in his opinion assessee could have
directly sold these goods to third parties. Ld.A.O. was of the opinion
assessee sold the goods through AE and part of the profits has been shifted to
the A.E.

13.1. It is observed that assessee bench marked the transaction of sale to AEs
by using internal CUP.
From records placed before us it is observed that assessee sold finished goods
to following AEs amounting to Rs.45,64,209/-:
(a) Adidas Solomon Sourcing Ltd.: Rs.44,05,621/-;
(b) Adidas New Zealand : Rs.67,760/-;
(c) Adidas Latin America: Rs.90,828/-
In paper book at page 321 vide submission dated 21/02/2014 assessee submitted
that, in order to capture the imagination of the buyer, every season, assessee
deals in more than 100 new styles of products and it is likely that all styles
and products are not popular and well accepted by customers. It has been
submitted that, under such circumstances generally 10-20% of styles are not
liked by the customers, which are classified as slow moving or obsolete.
13.2. From the records placed before us, it is observed that assessee had
imported finished goods amounting to Rs.13,76,26,854/- out of which, goods
worth Rs.45,64,209/- has been exported back due to its slow moving nature. The
percentage of goods exported is approximately 3.3%. In our opinion as the
percentage of goods that was returned back as slow moving is within the
permissible limits of less than 10%. Even otherwise the gross margin earned by
assessee from imported goods is in excess of 40% vis-à-vis the margin earned
by assessee from imported  25 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12
and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing
P Ltd.
goods is in excess of 40% vis-à-vis the margin earned by AE from sale with
third party in case of slow moving goods exported by assessee.
We are therefore of considered opinion that no adjustment is called for in
this regard.
13.3. Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed.
14\. Ground No. 4 is in respect of deduction on account of bad debts written
off amounting to Rs.71,88,979/-, being disallowed by Ld.AO.
15\. Ld.Counsel submitted that during year under consideration assessee had
written off a sum of Rs.71,88,979/- as bad debts during year under
consideration, out of total provision for bad debt account. He submitted that
though said amount reflected in audited accounts, however, inadvertently in
return of income such bad debt written off during year under consideration was
not claimed. Ld.Counsel submitted that subsequently during assessment
proceedings assessee vide letter dated 26/10/09 claimed deduction of such bad
debts written off as per section 36 (1) (vii) read with section 36 (2) of the
Act.
15.1. He submitted that Ld.AO as well as DRP upheld disallowance by holding
that assessee had made revised claim beyond statutory time period provided
under section 139(4) of the  26 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA

India Marketing P Ltd.
Act by way of filing revised return, placing reliance upon Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of Goetze India Ltd reported in 284 ITR 323.
15.2. Ld.Counsel submitted that in case of Goetze India Ltd (supra), Hon'ble
Supreme Court dealt with the issue of power of Assessing Officer to admit a
claim which was not raised in the return of income and does not incline on the
power of appellate authority. Instead placing reliance upon the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of TRF Ltd vs CIT reported in 323 ITR 397,
Ld.Counsel submitted that it is not necessary for assessee to establish that
the debt in fact had become irrecoverable and it was enough if bad debts is
written off as irrecoverable in the accounts of assessee.
16\. Ld.CIT, DR placed reliance upon the order of authorities below.
17\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of
records placed before us.
18\. In our considered opinion there are plethora of decisions by various
Courts and Hon'ble Supreme Court wherein it has been held that a legitimate
claim of assessee should be allowed even if it is raised during assessment
proceedings.
18.1. There is no dispute with the Department that said amount has been
written off in accounts of assessee. However merely because it was not claimed
in return of income, will not vitiate right of assessee to claim it during
pendency of assessment  27 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and

proceedings. Ld.TPO is directed to allow the claim of assessee as per law.
18.2. We therefore are inclined to set aside this issue to Ld.A>O.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
19\. Ground No. 5 raised by assessee is consequential in nature and therefore
do not require any adjudication.
20\. Accordingly appeal filed by assessee for assessment year 2006-07 stands
allowed for statistical purposes.
21\. Assessment year 2007-08.
ITA No. 2770/Del/2012 ( Revenue's appeal)
22\. Ground No. 1 raised by revenue is in respect of deleting sum of
Rs.15,56,02,591/-on account of AMP expenses by Ld.CIT(A).
23\. We have already set aside this issue to Ld.AO with certain direction
while deciding the same issue in assessee's appeal for Assessment Year
2006-07. Both parties agree that facts and circumstances of the case for year
under consideration is similar and there is no change in the nature of
expenses incurred by assessee.
23.1. On the basis of aforestated submissions and looking into the similarity
of facts in respect of this issue for year under consideration with that of
assessment year 2006-07 we are inclined to follow our view taken hereinabove

case of Sony Ericson India P.Ltd. (supra) and no further interference is

Indian entity licenses the brand directly from its overseas AE. In assessee's
case, a domestic AE (Adidas India private limited) has been interposed merely
as a planning device and with no economic substance. ...........

5.3. The assessee was asked to furnish the audited financial statement of its
immediate holding company in India with Adidas India private limited. On
perusal of the same, it is quite clear that the holding company is just a
shell company that does nothing else apart from holding investment in the
assessee. ........"
8.1.1. If we appreciate implication by Ld.TPO, then since holding company has
been opined by Ld.TPO to be shell company, in same breath, assessee would also
amount to be shell company being its holding company. It is observed that
Ld.TPO loosely used phrase 'lifting of corporate Veil', without understanding
attributes that needs to be established by way of cogent materials/evidences
to prove, a benefit of revenue having accrued to assessee.
8.1.2. We don't deny that there would be incidental benefit to foreign AE,
being, Adidas-Saloman AG, which is ultimate parent of assessee. However,
expenditure towards advertisement and marketing incurred by assessee in India
is mainly for its own benefit to market products manufactured by it in India.
Main purpose of incurring of such huge AMP expenses has largely benefited
assessee in India, with an incidental benefit arising to foreign AE. Unless
Ld.TPO can establish direct benefit accruing to foreign AE, it is very
difficult to accept existence of international transaction, under present
facts of the case. We rely upon decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case
of Sony Ericson Mobile Communication India Pvt.Ltd (supra) in support of
aforestated observations.

8.2. Further it has been submitted by both sides that facts and circumstances
in present appeal are no manner different with that of Maruti Suzuki Inida
Ltd. Reported in 381 ITR 117; and Soney Ericson Mobile Communications (supra),
wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that existence of international
transaction must be established de hors the Bright Line Test before
undertaking bench marking of AMP expenses. We are therefore inclined to follow
view taken by this Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Sony Ericson Mobile
Communications (supra), and delete adjustment made in respect of AMP expenses.
8.3. However, we appreciate the concern raised by Ld.Sr.DR that decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court will be binding upon assessee as well as revenue. We are
therefore, inclined to set aside this issue to Ld.AO/TPO to pass fresh order
considering decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Needless to say that proper
opportunity shall be granted to assessee of being heard."
23.2. Respectfully following the same we set aside this issue to Ld. AO/TPO to
pass fresh order considering decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court after giving
proper opportunity to assessee.
23.3. Accordingly this ground raised by revenue stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
24\. Ground No. 2 has been raised by revenue against deleting disallowance of
Rs.15,70,657/- on account of interest expenditure.
25\. Ld.Counsel submitted that during assessment year under consideration
Assessing Officer disallowed interest of Rs.15,70,657/- under section 36 (1)
(iii) of the Act. He submitted  31 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA
2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas
India Marketing P Ltd.
that Ld. AO made addition in the hands of assessee on the ground that assessee
granted loan to Associated Enterprises at 'nil' rate of interest from borrowed
funds, on which, assessee paid interest. Ld. Counsel submitted that there was
no loan that was given by assessee to its AE. Instead sum of Rs.2,08,31,000/-,
was recoverable from AE as on 31/03/07. It has been submitted that this amount
is coming as due since 2000-01 and no addition of this amount was made during
A.Y. 2000-01 to 2003-04. Ld.Counsel submitted that for first time for A.Y.
2004-05 Ld.AO made a disallowance by treating it as paid for non business
purpose.
25.1. Ld.Counsel in the written submissions placed reliance upon order dated
07/01/2011 by this Tribunal in assessee's own case in ITA No.1889/Del/2010 for
A.Y. 2004-05, wherein the sole issue for consideration was regarding
disallowance out of the interest payment made by assessee during relevant
year.
25.2. Ld.CIT,DR placed reliance on orders of authorities below.
26\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides and perused records
placed before us.
27\. It is observed that identical issue had been decided in A.Y. 2004-05
(supra) as under:
"8. We have heard both the parties and have carefully perused the orders of
the authorities below. We have also gone through various documents and papers
placed in the Paper Book filed by the assessee. We have also deliberated upon
the position of law explained in this regard by both the parties.
32
ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08
ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
9\. From the orders of the authorities below and materials on record, it is
clear that no amount was actually paid by the assessee to its holding company.
The amount remaining outstanding against the holding company is on account of
advertisement and brand promotion expenses which have been incurred by the
assessee but debited to the account of the holding company. It is also not in
dispute that the assessee company is an hundred per cent subsidiary of its
holding company. The holding company and the assessee company had entered into
a Technical Assistance Agreement whereby the holding company was to provide
exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable right to manufacture, distribute
and sell the licensed products in India, Nepal and Bhutan on payment of
royalty @ 5% of the sales effective of the licensed products in the aforesaid
territories. The assessee had incurred expenditure on advertisement and
promotion of its brand name. The assessee had debited part of the expenditure
on advertisement to its own profit and loss account also. In the assessment
year 1997-98 the 7 advertisement expenditure incurred by the assessee to
popularize the products was disallowed by the AO but ultimately found to be
admissible by the Tribunal and the order of the Tribunal has been confirmed by
the Hon'ble High Court. In that year, it was observed that merely because the
assessee was paying royalty @ 5% to its holding company would not mean that
the assessee could not incur the expenditure on advertisement to popularize
the products dealt with by it in Indian market. No doubt, brand name of Adidas
is already a well-known brand which belongs to the parent company of the
assessee. However, to popularize the said product in India and to promote its
sale in Indian territories, it became necessary to incur expenditure on
advertising to propagate the aforesaid brand name. The benefit thereof has to
necessarily accrue to the assessee as the main purpose of the advertisement
was to augment the sales. The fact that the advertisement expenditure was
incurred based on commercial practice and commercial expediency was accepted
by the Tribunal. It is, therefore, clear that the advertisement expenditure
33 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA 2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY
2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas India Marketing P Ltd.
even if debited by the assessee to its own profit and loss account could have
been allowed as admissible expenditure in the hands of the assessee within the
meaning of sec. 37 of the Act as so allowed in the assessment year 1997-98. In
the present assessment year under consideration the part of the advertisement
expenditure was agreed to 8 be borne by holding company. The assessee had
incurred expenditure on advertisement and debited the same to the account of
holding company. The act to incur expenditure on advertisement to promote the
brand name is undoubtedly based on business interest and commercial
expediency. Further, the assessee has been benefited by not paying the royalty
@ 5% of the sales during the year under consideration which was required to be
paid by the assessee as per Technical Assistance Agreement dated 14.02.1997
and therefore, the amount debited to the account of the holding company
remained outstanding, otherwise the same would have been adjusted against the
royalty payable, by the assessee company to the holding company. Further, no
actual amount has been paid by the assessee to the holding company during the
year under consideration. There was outstanding opening balance of
Rs.1,87,36,555/- at the opening of the year, which has been reduced to
Rs.1,81,06,555/- at the end of the year, which goes to show that no further
amount has actually been given by the assessee to its holding company. In the
course of hearing, it has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the
assessee that the identical addition made by the Assessing Officer in the
assessment year 2003-04 has been deleted by the CIT(A) vide order dated
22.10.2010 by applying the principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of S.A. Builders Ltd. Vs. CIT (2007) 288 ITR 1 9 (SC) and in that
respect, the learned counsel for the assessee relied upon the aforesaid
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In the case of S.A. Builders (supra),
the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that the expression "for the purpose of
business" includes expenditure voluntarily incurred for commercial expediency
and it is immaterial if a third party also benefits thereby. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court further observed that  34 ITA No.3727/Del/2014 AY 2006-07 ITA
2770/Del/12 and C.O.85/Del/2013 AY 2007-08 ITA 29/Del/14 AY 2008-09 Adidas
India Marketing P Ltd.
the expression "commercial expediency" is an expression of wide import and
includes such expenditure as a prudent businessman incurs for the purpose of
business. The expenditure may not have been incurred under any legal
obligation but yet it is allowable as business expenditure if it was incurred
on grounds of commercial expediency. In the present case, the expenditure
incurred towards advertisement for and on behalf of holding company are
undoubtedly on grounds of commercial expediency inasmuch as the assessee
undoubtedly would be benefited by making advertisement of the brand name
Adidas to augment and promote sale effected by the assessee in the notified
territories.
10\. In the light of the reasons given above, we therefore, hold that the
CIT(A) was not justified in confirming the Assessing Officer's action in
disallowing the sum of Rs.21,72,787/- out of the interest paid by the assessee
during the year. The orders of the authorities below are therefore, reversed
10 and the ground raised by the assessee is allowed being decided in favour of
the assessee. The Assessing Officer shall modify the assessment order
accordingly." 27.1. On perusal of assessment order dated 28/12/2010, it is
observed that Ld.AO while making disallowance placed reliance on assessment
order passed for A.Y. 2004-05, wherein identical disallowance was made.
27.2. Assessee has submitted that during year under consideration a sum of
Rs.2,08,31,000/- was shown recoverable as opening balance as on 01/04/2006
from AE.
27.3. It is observed that Ld.AO blindly made addition without appreciating the
fact that interest was not charged due to commercial expediency.

27.4. Respectfully applying ratio laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
of S.A.Builders vs. CIT (supra) we do not find any infirmity in the view taken
by Ld.CIT(A) and the same is upheld.
Accordingly this ground raised by revenue stands allowed.
28\. Ground No.3 is in respect of deleting Rs.3,64,952/- disallowance of extra
depreciation on computer peripherals.
28.1. Both the sides admit to the fact that the issue now stands squarely
covered by the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of CIT vs BSESE
Yamuna Power Ltd reported in 358 ITR 47.
In lieu of the above submissions, we are inclined to uphold the view of Ld.
CIT (A).
Accordingly this ground raised by revenue stands dismissed.
29\. In the result appeal filed by Revenue for A.Y. 2007-08 stands partly
allowed for statistical purposes.
30\. Cross Objection No.85/Del/15(Assessee) AY 2007-08 In the Cross Objection
filed by assessee in support of only issue raised is in respect of AMP
expenditure in support of view by Ld.CIT(A).

to that of A.Ys considered hereinabove.

Respectfully following the same, we are of considered opinion that no AMP
adjustment deserves to be made. However, keeping in view the request made by
Ld.CIT, DR the issue is set aside to Ld.TPO to pass fresh order after
considering decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Needless to say that proper
opportunity must be given to assessee.
32\. In the result the Cross Objection filed by assessee stands partly allowed
for statistical purposes.
33\. ITA No.29/Del/2014 A.Y. 2008-09 (Assessee's appeal) The only issue raised
by assessee in this appeal is in respect of adjustment on account of AMP
expenses amounting to Rs.8,31,93,238/-. Ld.Counsel has filed their submissions
dated 19.3.2019 in respect of this issue being ground nos. 2 to 4.
33.1. Both parties admit that facts and circumstances of this issue is similar
to that of A.Ys considered hereinabove.

35\. As regards ground nos. 5-13 is concerned, separate arguments have not
been raised by both sides. Accordingly the same stand dismissed.
36\. In the result appeal filed by assessee for AY 2008-09 stands partly
