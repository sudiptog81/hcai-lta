contradictions regarding the vehicle used by the police authority for reaching
at the spot for conducting raid. As per PW2, they had left on different
scooters whereas PW3 has stated that they had left the spot in the Pvt.
vehicle of PW2. For the reasons best known to him, complainant had chosen not
to appear in the court which again caused fatal dent to the prosecution case.
No criteria or basis of identification of Inlay cards as bogus has been placed
on record nor any original inlay card was produced for its comparison with the
alleged recovered pirated cards.
It is a cardinal principle of law that prosecution must prove the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt and all the benefits arising from the lacunaes
of the prosecution story must be given to the accused. Hence in my opinion,
prosecution has failed to bring such material on record which would have gone
to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt holding him
guilty for the offence alleged to have been committed by him resulting into
his conviction and sentence. Accused is, therefore, acquitted for the offence
. He be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in any other
                                                              39, East of Kailash New Delhi

j) Brief reasons for the just decision of the case:­ In brief the case of the
prosecution is that on19.12.97 at about 3.45 pm at house no. 700/24­B, near
gali no. 19, Dev Mandir Marg, Vijay park, Maujpur accused in his tenanted
premises, was found busy packing 6,89,050 infringed inlay cards inside carton
belonging to different Hindi films and those 6,89,050 cards were found to be
infringed ones for the purpose of sale and the accused had therefore committed
an offence punishable under section 63 Copyright Act. Accused was arrested in
this case and thereafter released on bail by court orders being involved in a
non bailable offence.
After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed against the accused.
Cognizance of the offence was taken against him by the Ld. Predecessor of this
court and accused was summoned to face trial. Charge for an offence punishable
under section 63 Copy Right Act was framed against the accused on 9.10.01 to
which he had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
3\. To prove its case prosecution has examined three witnesses in all.
PW1 H.C Prem Singh had deposed that on 19.12.97 he was working  2 as duty
officer at PS Bhajanpura . He had proved the copy of FIR Ex.PW1/A.
PW2 was Inspector Sh. S. K. Rathi who had deposed that on 19.12.97 he was
posted at Crime Branch and one Dharmender Kapoor had given him a complaint
regarding illegal sale of inlay cards at Crime Branch, Udyog Sadan. He then
directed SI Kuldeep Sharma to investigate the case. Thereafter SI Kuldeep
Sharma alongwith ASI Satish, HC Rajbir, Ct. Kallu, Complainant, Dharmender
Kapoor and one Krishan Kumar under his direction conducted the raid at house
no. 700/24­B, Gali No. 19, Dev Mandir Gali, Maujpur, Delhi and recovered
689050 in lay cards from the possession of accused Shiv Shankar. The infringed

party. He had not given any information to the local police or any other
police authority of the area where the raid was conducted but had informed to
the Sr. Officials of Crime Branch. He could not recall if he had mentioned

complainant Dharemnder Kapoor. He had admitted it to be correct that in their
office he had not made any entry in any record regarding the particulars of
the raiding place. He had further deposed that he had remained at the spot

During cross examination by Ld. defence counsel witness has deposed that
Inspector S. K. Rathi remained at the spot for conducting proceeding till they
reached at the PS after the conclusion of the proceedings. Inspector Rathi had
not prepared any document. However, he could not tell if Inspector Rathi had
put his signature on any document which was prepared in his presence. Before
recording FIR, duty officer had consumed half an hour. He had denied the
suggestion that he was not a member of the raiding party who had conducted the
raid. He had also denied the suggestion that he was deposing falsely at the
instance of the IO. IO SI Kuldeep Sharma could not be examined in this case
owing to his death. No other witness including the complainant was also
examined and thereafter PE was closed.
Statement of the accused was recorded under 313 Cr.P.C in which entire
incriminating evidence appearing against the accused on record was put to him
to which he had denied as false and incorrect. Accused had stated that he was
falsely implicated in this case and He had refused to lead any evidence in his
defence.
After appreciation of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as well as
perusal of the documents placed and proved on record by them, I have no
hesitation in holding that prosecution has not been able to bring home the
guilt of accused beyond any reasonable doubt as for the reasons best known to
it, till date prosecution had examined only three witnesses out of which the
testimony of PW2 is not at all helpful for the prosecution because his entire
deposition is based on hearsay as he himself had not  7 conducted any raid nor
had recovered any articles . Therefore his version is not admissible in
evidence being based on hearsay . Further more, there are serious
contradictions regarding the vehicle used by the police authority for reaching
at the spot for conducting raid. As per PW2, they had left on different
scooters whereas PW3 has stated that they had left the spot in the Pvt.
vehicle of PW2. For the reasons best known to him, complainant had chosen not
to appear in the court which again caused fatal dent to the prosecution case.
No criteria or basis of identification of Inlay cards as bogus has been placed
on record nor any original inlay card was produced for its comparison with the
alleged recovered pirated cards.
It is a cardinal principle of law that prosecution must prove the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt and all the benefits arising from the lacunaes
of the prosecution story must be given to the accused. Hence in my opinion,
prosecution has failed to bring such material on record which would have gone
to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt holding him
guilty for the offence alleged to have been committed by him resulting into
his conviction and sentence. Accused is, therefore, acquitted for the offence
. He be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in any other
case. File be consigned to record room after completion of necessary
formalities.

j) Brief reasons for the just decision of the case:­ In brief the case of the
prosecution is that on19.12.97 at about 3.45 pm at house no. 700/24­B, near
gali no. 19, Dev Mandir Marg, Vijay park, Maujpur accused in his tenanted
premises, was found busy packing 6,89,050 infringed inlay cards inside carton
belonging to different Hindi films and those 6,89,050 cards were found to be
infringed ones for the purpose of sale and the accused had therefore committed
an offence punishable under section 63 Copyright Act. Accused was arrested in
this case and thereafter released on bail by court orders being involved in a
non bailable offence.
After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed against the accused.
Cognizance of the offence was taken against him by the Ld. Predecessor of this
court and accused was summoned to face trial. Charge for an offence punishable
under section 63 Copy Right Act was framed against the accused on 9.10.01 to
which he had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
3\. To prove its case prosecution has examined three witnesses in all.
PW1 H.C Prem Singh had deposed that on 19.12.97 he was working  2 as duty
officer at PS Bhajanpura . He had proved the copy of FIR Ex.PW1/A.
PW2 was Inspector Sh. S. K. Rathi who had deposed that on 19.12.97 he was
posted at Crime Branch and one Dharmender Kapoor had given him a complaint
regarding illegal sale of inlay cards at Crime Branch, Udyog Sadan. He then
directed SI Kuldeep Sharma to investigate the case. Thereafter SI Kuldeep
contradictions regarding the vehicle used by the police authority for reaching
at the spot for conducting raid. As per PW2, they had left on different
scooters whereas PW3 has stated that they had left the spot in the Pvt.
vehicle of PW2. For the reasons best known to him, complainant had chosen not
to appear in the court which again caused fatal dent to the prosecution case.
No criteria or basis of identification of Inlay cards as bogus has been placed
on record nor any original inlay card was produced for its comparison with the
alleged recovered pirated cards.
It is a cardinal principle of law that prosecution must prove the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt and all the benefits arising from the lacunaes
of the prosecution story must be given to the accused. Hence in my opinion,
prosecution has failed to bring such material on record which would have gone
to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt holding him
guilty for the offence alleged to have been committed by him resulting into
his conviction and sentence. Accused is, therefore, acquitted for the offence
. He be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in any other
