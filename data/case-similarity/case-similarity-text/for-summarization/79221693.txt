COMMON CAV JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)
1\. Since the issues raised in all the captioned writ applications are the
same, those were heard analogously and are being disposed of by this common
judgment and order.
2\. For the sake of convenience, the Special Civil Application No.14206 of
2018 is treated as the lead matter.
3\. By this writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the writ applicant, a Public Limited Company, engaged in the manufacture and
sale of Petrochemicals, has prayed for the following reliefs;
> "(A) This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a writ striking down and

         Hon'ble Court may be pleased to                       issue a writ striking
         down and declaring Section 84A of                    the VAT Act as being

2\. Thus, the subject matter of challenge in all the writ applications is the
constitutional validity of Section 84A of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act,
2003 (for short "the GVAT Act"). The challenge to the constitutional validity
is substantially on the ground that Section 84A of the GVAT Act is ultra vires
and beyond the legislative competence of the State under Entry 54 of List II
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The challenge to the
validity is also on the ground that Section  Page 3 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT 84A of the GVAT Act is
arbitrary, unreasonable and, therefore, is violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
3\. The facts, giving rise to this litigation, may be summarized as under;
3.1 The Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Tax, Corporate-I, Ahmedabad passed
an assessment order dated 23.12.2009 for the Financial Year 2006-07 against
the writ applicant company by reversing the Input Tax Credit to the extent of
8% i.e. 4% under each of the provisions of Sections 11(3)(b)(ii) and
11(3)(b)(iii) of the GVAT Act.
3.2 The Joint Commissioner (Appeals), Baroda, being the First Appellate
Authority, vide order dated 30.12.2010 dismissed the First Appeal filed by the
Petitioner Company under Section 73 of the VAT Act, confirming the aforesaid
order dated 23.12.2009.
3.3 On 26.04.2012, the Gujarat Vat Tribunal passed an order allowing the
Second Appeal of the Petitioner Company, by quashing and setting aside both
the above referred orders of the Sales Tax Authorities by holding, inter alia,
that the First Appellate Authority had erred in confirming the Assessment
Order for branch transfer and consignment adjustments wherein admissible Input
Tax Credit was reduced twice, while applying both clauses (ii) as well as
(iii) of Section 11(3)(b) of the VAT Act, resulting into reduction of the
Input Tax Credit to the extent of 8% for purchases of furnace oil, natural gas
and light diesel oil, as sub-clause (iii) of Section 11(3)(b) of the VAT Act
is not applicable to consignment of branch transfer transactions.

CAV JUDGMENT
3.4 This Court, vide its judgment dated 18.1.2013 reported in 2013 SCC Online
Guj. 8788 dismissed the appeal of the State Government filed against the
aforesaid order of the VAT Tribunal, while holding inter alia, that the
reduction of Input Tax Credit under Section 11(3)(b) would, in no case, exceed
4% on the ground that the limitation of availing of the tax credit as provided
under Section 11(3)((b) could be applied only once irrespective of the fact as
to whether particular commodity purchased falls in more than one sub-clauses
of Section 11(3)(b) of the VAT Act.
3.5 On 30.03.2013, an Assessment Order came to be passed by the Deputy
Commissioner of Commercial Tax, Ahmedabad for the F.Y. 2008-09 in the case of
the petitioner Company, deciding the assessment proceedings for the said
period as under in respect of the two different issues;
(I) As per the aforesaid judgment dated 18.01.2013 of this Court, rendered in
the case of the petitioner Company with respect to the reduction of Input Tax
Credit on natural gas used as raw material, the competent authority reduced
the ITC of the Petitioner Company at the rate of 4%, instead of 8%, under the
provisions of Section 11(3)(b) of the Act.
(ii) As per the decision dated 30.04.2010 of the Gujarat VAT Tribunal,
rendered in the case of Welspun Gujarat Stahi Rohren Ltd., while considering
the availment of sales tax incentive limit, under the provisions of Section
49(2) of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969 the tax paid by the assessee on
purchases of goods used in manufacture of taxable goods exported outside the
country was not to be included. In other words,  Page 5 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT according to the
Tribunal, the said incentive limit cannot be curtailed by the said tax paid by
the assessee.
3.6 In an appeal filed by the State against the aforesaid decision dated
30.04.2010 rendered by the Tribunal in the case of Welspun Gujarat Stahi
Rohren Ltd., this Court vide its judgment dated 04.04.2014, nullified the
findings and observations of the Tribunal and, inter alia, held that while
considering the availment of sales tax incentive limit, the tax paid on the
purchase of goods used in the manufacture of taxable goods exported outside
the country is required to be considered.
3.7 in view of the aforesaid judgment dated 04.04.2014 of this Court rendered
in the case of Welspun Gujarat (supra), the Additional Commissioner of
Commercial Tax issued a revision dated 10.03.2018 under Section 75 of the VAT
Act to the petitioners to show cause as to why the assessment order dated
30.03.2013, referred to above, at Sr. No.5 should not be revised so as to give
effect to the aforesaid judgment of this Court in the case of Welspun Gujarat
(supra) and thereby, reducing the sales tax incentive limit after considering
the tax paid on purchases of the goods used in manufacture of taxable goods,
exported outside the country.
3.8 The provisions of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act,
2016, came to be enacted, which came into force w.e.f. 01.07.2017.
3.9 On 20.09.2016, the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Tax passed an
order and reduced the sales tax incentive, in case of the Petitioner Company,
while considering  Page 6 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the tax paid on the purchase of taxable goods
used in the manufacture of taxable goods, exported outside the country.
3.10 On 01.07.2017, the legislations, i.e, the Gujarat Goods and Services Tax
Act, 2017 and the Central Goods & Services Tax Act, 2017 came into force to
levy tax on all the intra-state suppliers of goods or services or both.
3.11 Apropos the aforesaid Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016, the
Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 came to be substantially amended by way of
substitution and deletion of many provisions thereof by virtue of the Gujarat
Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 2017, which came into force w.e.f.
01.07.2017.
3.12 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court passed an order dated 22.09.2017 in an
appeal filed by the State, setting aside the aforesaid judgment dated
18.01.2013 of this Court by holding, inter alia, that the Input Tax Credit is
required to be reduced twice. i.e, to the extent of total 8%, under sub
clauses (ii) and
(iii) of Section 11(3)(b) of the VAT Act , in such a way that the reduction
should not exceed the amount of the Input Tax credit claimed. The said
judgment of the Supreme Court was reported in (2017) 16 SCC 28.
3.13. In view of the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court, the Additional
Commissioner of Commercial Tax issued a revision notice dated 03/06.11.2017 in
Form 503 under Sections 75 of the Act to revise the Assessment Order for F.Y.
2008-09 made vide order dated 30.03.2013 (Sr. No.5 above), for reducing the
Input Tax Credit to the extent of 8% under the provisions of Section
11(3)(b)(ii) and 11(3)(b)(iii) of the VAT Act  Page 7 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT in light of the
judgment dated 22.09.2017 of the Supreme Court.
3.14 By an order dated 16.03.2018, this Court, while allowing the Special
Civil Application No.22283 of 2018 filed by the petitioner, quashed and set
aside the aforesaid revision notice issued by the department under Section 75
of the VAT Act on the ground that the said revision notice cannot be sustained
being beyond the period of limitation provided under Section 75 of the VAT
Act.
3.15 By virtue of the VAT Amendment Act, 2018, Section 84A came to be added in
the VAT Act to be operative retrospectively w.e.f 01.04.2006, inter alia,
providing for the exclusion of the period spent between the date of the
decision of the appellate tribunal and that of the High Court as well as the
Supreme Court in computing the period of limitation, referred to in Section 75
of the VAT Act. In the present case, the period commencing from the date of
the decision of this Court dated 18.01.2013 rendered against the revenue upto
the date of the decision of the Supreme Court i.e., 22.09.2017 being in favour
of the revenue, is sought to be excluded by virtue of the above referred
retrospective amendment to enable the department to issue a notice for
revision for revising the assessment made for the year 2008-09 and thereby
removing the basis of the later judgment dated 16.03.2018 of this Court (Sr.
No.10 above).
3.16 in view of the above, on 01.09.2018, fresh notice for revision came to be
issued by the Addl. Commissioner of Commercial Tax to the Petitioner on the
basis of the above  Page 8 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT referred newly added Section 84A, for revising
the assessment for the F.Y.2008-09 made vide order dated 30.03.2013 (at Sr.
No.5 above) for reducing the Input Tax Credit to the extent of 8% under the
provisions of Section 11(3)(b)(ii) and 11(3)(b)(iii) of the VAT Act in light
of the judgment dated 22.09.2017 of the Supreme Court.
3.17 In the present case, the original period of limitation as provided under
Section 75 of the VAT Act for issuing notice is of 3 years from the date of
the assessment order i.e. 30.03.2013 which had lapsed on 30.03.2016. However,
by virtue of the newly enacted Section 84A, the period spent from the date of
the decision of the High Court is 18.01.2013 upto the date of the decision of
the Supreme Court i.e. 22.09.2017 is to be excluded in computing the aforesaid
period of three years, referred to under Section 75 of the Act.
3.18 In such circumstances, referred to above, the writ applicant seeks to
challenge the constitutional validity of Section 84A of the GVAT Act as well
as the revision notice dated 01.09.2018.
Submissions on behalf of the writ applicant;
4\. Mr. S.N.Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing with Mr. Uchit N.
Sheth, the learned counsel appearing for the writ applicant vehemently
submitted that Section 84A of the GVAT Act is without legislative competence
and, therefore, is unconstitutional. Mr. Soparkar would submit that the
constitution (101st Amendment) Act , 2016 introduced the Goods & Services Tax
regime in India. It sought to replace all  Page 9 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the indirect taxes,
levied on the goods and services by the Union of India as well as the State
Governments. It came to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on manufacture,,
sale or consumption of goods and services. The Act of 2016 inserted Articles
246A, 269A and 279A to the Constitution of India. It amended the provisions of
Article 286 of the Constitution. It deleted Entry No.92 and 92C of List-I of
the Seventh Schedule and inserted Entry 84 of List-I and Entry 54 of List-II
of the Seventh Schedule. In tune with the constitutional amendments
incorporated, the Central Goods & Services Tax Act, 2017, Integrated Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017 and the respective State Goods and Services Tax Act,
2017 were enacted. Mr. Soparkar further submitted that Article 246A of the
Constitution of India makes the provision with respect to goods and services
tax. It empowers the Parliament and the legislature of every State, subject to
Article 246A(2) and notwithstanding anything contained in Articles 246 and
254, to make laws with respect to Goods and Services Tax imposed by the Union
or the State. According to Mr. Soparkar, while the State Legislatures have
been empowered to impose goods and service tax by the newly inserted Article
246A of the Constitution, the scope of Entry 54 has been drastically curtailed
to six specific products. It is submitted that the State Legislature does not
have the competence to enact any law under Entry 54 except the law concerning
only the six specific products. It is vehemently submitted that despite such
limited legislative competence, the State Legislature proceeded to enact
Section 84A whereby the assessment related to the tax liability of all goods
which were earlier covered under Entry 54 are now sought to be reopened. In
other words, according to Mr. Soparkar, liability is sought to be imposed and
enforced in  Page 10 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT respect of all goods though the competence of
the Legislature is limited to the six products. In such circumstances,
according to Mr. Soparkar, Section 84A of the Vat Act is beyond the
legislative competence of the State Legislature.
5\. According to Mr. Soparkar, the competence of the Legislature could be
adjudged at the time of the enactment of the provision. If at the time of
passing the law if the Legislature has the necessary competence, then such law
can even be passed with retrospective effect covering the period when the
Legislature did not have the competence. However, if at the time of the
amendment, the Legislature does not have the competence, then the law cannot
be enacted on the ground that the same is concerning the period when the
Legislature had the necessary competence. In support of this submission, Mr.
Soparkar seeks to rely on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of A.
Hajee Abdul Shukoor & Co. vs. State of Madras, (1964) 15 STC 719 (SC) (page
730).
6\. Mr. Soparkar drew the attention of this Court to Section 19 of the
Constitution Amendment Act. Drawing the attention of this Court to Section 19
of the Constitution Amendment Act, he submitted that it was provided in the
Constitution Amendment Act that any legal provision inconsistent with the
provisions of the unamended constitution shall continued to be in force until
amended or repealed by a competent legislature or until expiration of one year
from the commencement of the Constitution Amendment Act. In other words, even
an existing statutory provision would automatically cease to exist latest by
one year from the date of the commencement of the Constitution Amendment Act.
In such circumstances, the State  Page 11 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT legislature definitely lacks
the competence to make a new enactment such as Section 84A pertaining to the
erstwhile entries of the State List.
7\. Mr. Soparkar would submit that Section 84A of the VAT Act is not saved
under Article 246A of the Constitution. He would submit that Article 246A of
the Constitution was inserted by the 101st Constitution Amendment Act with the
prime object of subsuming multiple indirect taxes and to confirm concurrent
power upon the Parliament and State Legislature to impose "Goods & Services
Tax' in accordance with the recommendations of the Goods & Services Tax
Council constituted under Article 279A of the Constitution.
8\. Mr. Soparkar would submit that if the State Legislature could be said to
have the power to enact the Value Added Tax Laws under Article 246A of the
Constitution, then the Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution which was retained to the extent of six products kept outside the
GST regime, will be rendered redundant. The argument of the learned senior
counsel is that the fact that Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule
stands retained so far as the six products are concerned, indicates that the
sales tax/value added tax enactment is not permissible under Article 246A of
the Constitution. The learned senior counsel would submit that the stance of
the State that Article 246A of the Constitution supports the enactment of the
provision under the VAT Act flies in the face of the existence of Entry 54 of
List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which survived the 101 st
Constitution Amendment Act.
9\. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the case of the State that  Page 12 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the
impugned proceedings are one relating to the recovery towards one of the six
products covered under Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is contrary
to the materials on record. It is submitted that the goods manufactured by the
writ applicant are in the nature of petrochemicals and are not covered by
Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. It is
submitted that if the revision initiated by the impugned notice is concluded
by disallowance of the Input Tax Credit, then the same would result in the
recovery of tax on such petrochemicals.
10\. Mr. Soparkar submitted that Section 84A of the VAT Act is manifestly
arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of
India. He would submit that when the assessment for a particular year attains
finality, the same creates a vested right in favour of the dealer. The dealer
would, accordingly, arrange his affairs. The alteration of such position
without any definite time limit only on the ground that a judgment has been
pronounced in favour of the Revenue in another case is manifestly arbitrary
and illegal. In support of such submission, the learned senior counsel seeks
to rely on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab
vs. Shereyas Industries Ltd., (2006) 91 VST 23 (SC).
11\. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Soparkar submitted that any legislation
which is found to be manifestly arbitrary can be struck down as violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution. In this regard, strong reliance has been
placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs.
Union of India, (2017) 9 SCC 1.
Page 13 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
12\. Mr. Soparkar would submit that the retrospective insertion of Section 84A
with effect from 01.04.2006 makes the provision exhaustively arbitrary and
unreasonable. He would submit that the Legislature may have the power to
legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively, but any retrospective
legislation would be prone to the scrutiny on the anvil of the test of
reasonableness. In this regard, reliance is placed on the decisions of the
Supreme Court in the case of Rai Ramkrishna vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1963 SC
1667 and Epari Chinna Krishna Moorthy vs. State of Orissa, AIR 1964 SC 1581.
Mr. Soparkar also invited the attention of this Court to the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of R.C. Tobacco (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India, 2005 7
SCC 725.
13\. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Soparkar seeks to rely upon the following
decisions;
(I) in the case of Jayam & Co. vs. Assistant Commissioner, (2016) 96 VST 1
(SC);
(ii) In the case of Filco Trade Centre Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India, (2008) 57
GSTR 204 (Guj.);
(iii) In the case of Avani Exports vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, (2012) 348
ITR 391 (Guj.); (Para 24)
14\. Mr. Soparkar further submitted that the test of unforeseen and
unforeseeable burden should be applied keeping in mind the impugned
retrospective amendment. He pointed out that the revision proceedings were
permitted to be initiated only within three years from the date of passing of
the  Page 14 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT order. Such position was prevailing even under
the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969. Section 67 of the Sales Tax Act empowered the
Commissioner to initiate the revision proceedings within the stipulated time
limit and it was consistently held that the revision proceedings initiated
beyond the stipulated period of limitation was time barred.
15\. Mr. Soparkar further submitted that the provisions of limitation in the
taxing statute are enacted with a specific objective of giving certainty and
finality to the legal proceedings and to avoid exposure to the risk of
litigation for an indefinite period of time. Any changes in such limitation
period should be ordinarily prospective. He would submit that the
retrospective operation given to the impugned amendment without any valid
reason could be termed as manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of
the Constitution of India. In this context, reliance is placed on the decision
of the Supreme Court in the case of K.M. Sharma vs. Income Tax Officer, 2002
(4) SCC 339 and the judgment of this Court in the case of Tata Teleservices
vs. Union of India, (2016) 385 ITR 497 (Guj.).
16\. Mr. Soparkar vehemently submitted that the impugned amendment leads to an
absurd situation with unforeseeable consequences. In such circumstances, the
same is manifestly arbitrary. Mr. Soparkar gave an example in this regard. By
way of an illustration, he pointed out that a case in which Mr. X of Surat
selling cotton yarn was assessed to tax for the year 2006-07 at the rate of 5%
in March, 2010. Such assessment was not challenged by either side and the same
attained finality. For the same period, issue was raised in the case of  Page
15 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV
JUDGMENT Mr. Y of Rajkot, demanding tax at the rate of 15% on the cotton yarn.
Mr. Y succeeds before the Appellate Authority and the rate of tax is held to
be 5%. The Department prefers appeal before the Tribunal and the same is
pending. In the year 2025, the matter in the case of Mr. Y reaches the Supreme
Court and holds that the applicable rate of tax on cotton yarn is 15%. In such
circumstances, the impugned amendment will enable the authorities to revise in
the year 2025 the assessment order passed in the case of Mr. X of Surat in the
year 2010. This, according to Mr. Soparkar, is violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution as it could be termed as manifestly arbitrary.
17\. Mr. Soparkar also submitted that the impugned amendment is violative of
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India as it adversely effects the
fundamental right of free trade business.
18\. Mr. Soparkar also submitted that Section 84A of the VAT Act is not a
validating Act by any stretch of imagination. There was no levy which was held
to be illegal by any Court which needs validation. The revision notices had
been issued beyond the statutory period of limitation and those were quashed
on such ground. Therefore, according to Mr. Soparkar, there is nothing to be
validated by Section 84A of the Act. It could be said that a fresh liability
is sought to be created by retrospectively extending the period of limitation.
19\. For the purpose of understanding the true meaning of the term "validation
Act" reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Amarendra Kumar Mohapatra vs. State of Orissa, (2014) 4 SCC 583. it was  Page
16 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV
JUDGMENT also argued that Section 64 of the VAT Act fortifies all the above
referred submissions, more particularly, that the impugned provision is
excessive and disproportionate. Mr. Soparkar also submitted that the impugned
Section 84A of the VAT Act cannot be defended on the ground that the tax dues
which were morally due to the State are sought to be recovered. It is
submitted that the reasons of morality and fairness can have no application to
bring a person within the four corners of the taxing statute so as to make him
liable to payment of tax. In this regard, reliance is placed on the decision
of the Supreme Court in the case of Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Taxes
vs. LIS (Registered), (2018) 15 SCC 283.
20\. It is submitted that the stance of the State that as it was remedy less,
it had to insert Section 84A of the Act , is absolutely not tenable in law. It
is submitted that the respondents could have issued notice for revision under
Section 75 of the VAT Act within the stipulated period of limitation to keep
the matter alive. It is submitted that if the time period for passing order in
revision was to expire and the issue was still pending before the Supreme
Court, then the respondents could have passed an order in favour of the dealer
and, thereafter, carried the matter before the Tribunal/High Court by filing
the revision application/appeal. In this regard, reliance is placed on the
decision of this Court in the case of Nestle India Ltd. vs. Deputy
Commissioner of Commercial Tax, (2016) 89 VST 56.
21\. In the last, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Commissioner
is empowered to revise an assessment order  Page 17 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT passed by his delegatee
under Section 75 of the VAT Act . Once such power of revision in respect of an
assessment order is exercised, then the power gets exhausted and the same
assessment order cannot be revised again. In this regard, reliance is placed
on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of OCL India Ltd. vs. State
of Orissa, (2003) 130 STC 35 (SC) and the decision of this Court in the case
of Malaviya Bros. & Co. vs. Sales Tax Officer, 1973 GSTB 206
22\. In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Soparkar, the learned
senior counsel appearing for the writ applicant prays that there being merit
in all his submissions, referred to above, the provision of Section 84A of the
VAT Act deserves to be declared as ultra vires.
Submissions on behalf of the State Government;
23\. Mr. Kamal Trivedi, the learned Advocate General appearing for the State
vehemently submitted that the State Legislature is empowered to enact taxation
laws relating to the intra-state supply with respect to only six items and not
with any other items. Prior to the enactment of Constitution (101" Amendment)
Act, 2016, in terms of Article 246 of the Constitution of India, the Union and
the State Governments were empowered to make laws relating to the matters
covered under List I (Union List), List ll (State List) and List Ill
(concurrent List). In other words, there used to be a clear demarcation of
legislative powers between the Union and the States by confining themselves
within the field entrusted upon them.
24\. In terms of the erstwhile Entry 54 of List II, the State  Page 18 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
legislature was empowered to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other
than newspapers, subject to the provisions of entry 92A of List I. In other
words, in respect of all intra-state sale / purchase of goods other than
newspaper, the State legislature was empowered to levy taxes on the said
transactions.
25\. However, while making a paradigm shift in the indirect tax regime to
empower the Centre and the State, both to levy taxes simultaneously, the
Constitution came to be amended vide the 101st Constitution Amendment Act,
2016. Pertinently, vide the said Constitutional Amendment, new Article 246A
came to be inserted in the Constitution of India, which confers right upon
both, the Union and the legislature of every State to make laws with respect
to goods and services for imposition of tax. by the Union or by such State.
26\. Mr. Trivedi pointed out that the said erstwhile Entry 54 of List ll of
the 7th Schedule also came to be amended vide the 101st Constitution Amendment
Act, 2016.
27\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that It was never the intention of the
Parliament to take away the power of the State legislature to enact laws with
respect to intra-state sale or purchase of goods. However, the intention as
discernible from the language of the above Article 246A, clearly appears to
confer simultaneous powers on the Union and the State legislatures to make
laws for levying tax simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods or
services or both. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Trivedi seeks to rely upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India vs. Mohit  Page 19
of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV
JUDGMENT Mineral Pvt. Ltd., reported in (2019) 2 SCC 599.
28\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that the term "goods and services tax', used in
the afore-quoted Article 246A of the Constitution of India, is defined under
Article 366(12A) of the Constitution, which means "any tax" on "supply of
goods" which necessarily occurs on the sale of goods.
29\. According to Mr. Trivedi, by virtue of Article 246A read with Article
366(12A) of the Constitution of India, the Union and the State legislatures,.
both have power to make laws with respect to any tax on supply of goods. or
services or both except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for human
consumption. At this stage. it Is worthwhile to note that, undisputedly, the
term "supply includes 'sales/purchases.
30\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that by virtue of the said Constitution
Amendment Act of 2016, two major changes have been brought in picture:
(a) Tax would be now imposed on 'supply of goods', which was earlier used to
be only on 'sale/purchase of goods';
(b) The demarcation of powers between the Union and the legislatures of every
State has disappeared and that the Union and the legislatures of every State,
both are empowered to make laws with reference to the supply of goods:
31\. It is further argued that by virtue of Article 246A of the Constitution
of India, the power to make laws with respect to 'intra-state' sale or
purchase of goods still exists with the State legislature, even after the
enactment of the said 101 st  Page 20 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Constitution Amendment Act of
2016. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Trivedi seeks to rely on a recent
pronouncement of the Kerala High Court in the case of Golden Jewels (India)
Pvt. Ltd. vs. State Tax Officer, 2019 SCC Online Ker. 973.
32\. It is pointed out that the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge
has been affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court
vide judgment dated 6th March, 2019.
33\. Mr. Trivedi submitted that it is a settled principle of law that the
Entries to the legislative lists are not the sources of the legislative power,
but are merely topics or fields of legislation and that the competence to
legislate flows from Articles in Part XI of the Constitution of India. Hence,
amendment: in such Entries, like amendment in Entry 54 of List II in the
present case would not make any difference to the legislative competence of
the State legislature to make any laws, which otherwise flows from the
substantive provisions under the Constitution.
34\. It is submitted that by enacting Section 84A in the VAT Act, the State
Legislature has not proposed to levy any fresh tax, but merely allowed the
department to enlarge the period of limitation under the provisions of Section
75 of the VAT Act, if permissible, so as to collect the legitimate tax already
levied, but was not collected in view of pendency of litigation before the
Apex Court.
35\. It is submitted that though the Constitutional (101" Amendment) Act,
2016, was passed to subsume various taxes,  Page 21 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT like excise, service
tax, VAT, etc., but, the same does not indicate that henceforth, the State
Legislature would not have any power to make laws with respect to VAT, for the
past transactions under the provisions of Section 75 of the VAT Act, more
particularly, in view of Article 246A read with Article 366(12A) of the 101st
Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, read with Section 142(6) and 142(7) of the
CGST Act.
36\. According to Mr. Trivedi, 101st Constitutional Amendment Act of 2016,
inter alia. inserting Article 246A. starting with non- obstante clause, came
into effect on 01.07.2017 conferring power on the State Legislature to enact
law with reference to any tax on supply of goods. Whereas, Section 84A came to
be enacted by the State Legislature on 03.04.2018, to be operated upon
retrospectively with effect from 01.04.2006, which is the date on which the
VAT Act had come into force.
37\. According to Mr. Trivedi, the State Legislature was very much competent
to legislate when it enacted Section 84A of the VAT Act. According to Mr.
Trivedi, the decision relied upon on behalf of the writ applicant of the
Supreme Court in the case of A. Hajee Abdul Shakoor (supra0 is of no avail.
38\. Mr. Trivedi gave us a fair idea as regards the effect of Section 19 of
the Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016. It is submitted that w.e.f.
01.07.2017, the Gujarat VAT Act, 2003 came to be substantially amended and
more particularly Section 2(13) dealing with the definition of the term
'goods' with reference to the amended Entry 54 of List II and the addition of
sub-section (2A) in Section 100 relating to Repeal and Savings with further
insertion of Section 84A on  Page 22 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT 03.04.2018. However, the said
newly inserted Section 84A is not inconsistent with the provision of Section
19 of the Constitution Amendment Act, 2016, nor has the said Section 19 of the
Constitution Amendment Act, 2016 denuded State's power to enforce Gujarat VAT
Act in its amended form.
39\. Mr. Trivedi would submit, relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of J.K. Jute Mills Company Ltd. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1961
SC 1354 that the power of the legislature to enact a law with reference to a
topic entrusted to it is unqualified and, therefore, in exercise of such
power, it is competent for the legislature to enact a law which is either
prospective or retrospective. Mr. Trivedi, without prejudice to his aforesaid
submission, would submit that there are many ways and means of enacting and
amending the Act for the purpose of inserting an amendment in the existing
legislation with retrospective effect. Such amending Acts have the effects of
validating, curing or declaring etc. with retrospective effect for the purpose
of overcoming a legal obstacle or curing existing legal defects, or validating
the tax declared illegal or declaring a particular position of law.
40\. According to Mr. Trivedi, for all practical purposes, the VAT Amendment
Act of 2018 is a validating Act, inasmuch as it has sought to overcome the
obstacle in terms of limitation of 3 years provided under Section 75 of the
VAT Act, which obstacle stood confirmed by this Court vide its judgment dated
16.03.2018 in SCA No.22283 of 2018, while quashing and setting aside the
revision notice dated 03/06.11.2017 issued by the State Authorities to revise
the assessment order for Financial Year 2008-09, as time barred under Section
75 and  Page 23 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT hence, illegal. This revision notice was issued
on the basis of the judgment dated 22.09.2017 of the Supreme Court reported in
(2017) 16 SCC 28, whereby the judgment dated 18.01.2013 of this Court,
reported in 2013 SCC Online Guj. 8788, was set aside necessitating the
recovery of lost revenue.
41\. Mr. Trivedi seeks to rely on the decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. vs. Broach Boroush Municipality, 1969
Part II SCC 283.
42\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that there is no merit in the contention
canvassed on behalf of the writ applicant that it is mandatory that there has
to be an invalid levy of tax declared by any Competent Court which can be
validated by a Validating Act. There can be a Validating Act conferring
jurisdiction which may be absent or validating the illegal demand of tax on
the basis of wrong interpretation of the provisions as held by the Court by
amending the said provision retrospectively. In support of such submission,
Mr. Trivedi seeks to rely on the following three decisions;
(I) In the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh vs. Hindustan Machine Tools
Ltd., (1975) 2 SCC 274;
(II) In the case of M/s. Ujagar Prints vs. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 488;
(III) In the case of Asst. Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax, (2015) 11
SC 462;
43\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that the statutes of limitation are
retrospective in nature, when they deal with procedural law  Page 24 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT and
they are prospective, when they deal with the substantive rights, unless the
same are expressly or by implication made retrospective. In other words, there
is no bar under the Constitution that a statute of limitation impacting a
substantive right, cannot be made retrospective in nature. Thus, even if
Section 84A of the VAT Act is considered to be not a Validating Act, but
simply a statutory provision relating to limitation, then in that case also,
the same is rightly brought in picture with retrospective effect.
44\. Mr. Trivedi also seeks to rely upon the following three decisions to
fortify his submission that a law cannot be held to be unreasonable merely
because it operates retrospectively.
(I) In the case of R.C. Tobacco Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India & Anr., reported
in (2005) 7 SCC 725;
(II) In the case of Raj Ramkrishna vs. State of Bihar, reported in AIR 1963 SC
1667;
(III) In the case of Epari Chinna Krishna Moorthy vs. State of Orissa,
reported in AIR 1964 SC 1581;
45\. On the issue of reopening of the closed assessments, the submissions of
Mr. Trivedi are as under;
> "1. It has been contended on behalf of the Petitioners that by virtue of
> Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act, it is not legally permissible to the
> department to reopen the assessments which have already attained finality

46\. As regards the retrospective Introduction of Section 84A of the VAT Act
being manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India, the submissions of Mr. Trivedi are as under;
Page 26 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
"1. It has been contended on behalf of the Petitioners that the provision
under challenge is manifestly arbitrary on the ground that the same seeks to
reopen the assessments and in other words, take away the vested rights of the
Petitioners. As per the Petitioners, once the assessment for a particular year
attains finality, the same creates a vested right in favour of the Petitioners
and alteration of such vested rights and that too, on the ground that judgment
in favour of the revenue has been pronounced by a Court in some other case. is
manifestly arbitrary and illegal.
2\. In this regard. it is submitted that the provision under challenge is
neither manifestly arbitrary nor illegal, as alleged or otherwise. In fact,
even it is considered that finality of an assessment, for a particular year.
creates a vested right in favour of the Petitioners. then in that event also.
in terms of Section 35/75 of the VAT Act. it is always open for the competent
authority to reopen/revise the assessment orders, within the prescribed time
limit, which have attained finality.
3\. In the present case, the provision under challenge merely enables the
authority to exclude the period spent before the competent forum for deciding
the issue. The said provision under challenge is only enacted with a view to
safeguard the revenue, which the authority would lose, with efflux of time,
without any fault on the part of the department but only due to the pendency
of cases before the Higher forum. In this behalf, reliance is placed on the
above judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Commercial Tax Officer Vs.
Biswanath Jhunjhunwalla, reported in (11) (1996) 5 SCC 626.
4\. Thus. in other words, though the interpretation provided by the Supreme
Court would be applied retrospectively. due to the prescribed time limit of 3
years provided for reopening of assessments in the VAT Act. the department was
not able to reopen the past assessments prior to the period of 3 years,
resulting in lose the revenue, which the State was otherwise entitled for.
5\. In addition to above, even otherwise. in taxation matters, the law laid
down by the Courts with respect to the interpretation of any provision, apply
to all the cases  Page 27 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT and that, it is not open for any assessee to
contend that reopening of its case, on the ground of a judgment delivered in
favour of the revenue by a Court in some other case. is manifestly arbitrary
and illegal.
6\. As such, at the most, the provision under challenge merely extends the
time limit prescribed under Section 35/75 of the VAT Act, which ultimately
enables the department to issue show cause notice as to why the assessment
order of a particular year should not be reopened and at that stage, the
concerned assessee can show cause as to how and in what manner, the judgment
delivered in some other case is not applicable to the facts of the said
assessee. Hence, the same does not envisage imposition of tax/penalty directly
but, the same would only be levied/imposed only after hearing the concerned
assessee. Thus, there arises no question of arbitrariness.
7\. Petitioners have relied upon the following four authorities for contending
that Section 84A of the VAT Act is "manifestly arbitrary" and hence hit by
contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It is undoubtedly
true that the legislation can now be struck down as unconstitutional on the
ground that the same being manifestly arbitrary. However, that does not mean
that Section 84A of the VAT Act is manifestly arbitrary.
8 As observed by the Apex Court in the aforesaid case of Shayara Bano (supra),
"manifestly arbitrariness" means something done by legislature capriciously,
irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle, or something done
which is excessive and disproportionate.
9\. In fact, one needs to consider as to which particular provision came to be
held as as 'manifestly arbitrary" in the above referred four judgments by the
Supreme Court and then, to equate Section 84A of the VAT Act with those
provisions. On mere comparison of this type will reveal that by no stretch of
imagination, Section 84A of the VAT Act can be considered to be manifestly
arbitrary, much less arbitrary."
47\. On the issue of the retrospective operation of the provision under
challenge being unreasonable and violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution, the submissions of Mr.  Page 28 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr
16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Trivedi are as under;
> "1. It is contended on behalf of the Petitioners that the retrospective
> operation provided to the provision under challenge is unreasonable, on the
> ground that the same fails the test of reasonableness, as laid down by the
> Apex Court in the case of R. C. Tobacco Vs. Union of India reported in
> (2005) 7 sec 725.
> 2\. In this regard. it is submitted that applying the said tests to the
> retrospectivity of the provision under challenge, the same would clear the
> test of the reasonableness and that the same is not unreasonable, as alleged
> or otherwise.
> 3\. As far as the test with regard to the context in which the
> retrospectivity is contemplated is concerned, it is submitted that the
> provision under challenge has been given retrospective effect only with a

> 4\. As far as the period of such retrospectivity is concerned, it is

> Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT his/her business.
> 5\. In addition to the above. It is pertinent to note that the power of the

> 6\. Therefore. the retrospective operation of the provision under challenge
> is not unreasonable and hence, the said provision under challenge is not
> required to be struck down."
48\. On the argument canvassed by the learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the writ applicant that the assessment order cannot be revised for
the second time, the submissions of Mr. Trivedi are as under;
> "1. It is alternatively contended on behalf of the Petitioners that when the
> revision powers conferred under Section 75 is exercised once, then in that
> event, such powers get exhausted and the said assessment order cannot be
> revised once again. In other words. as per Petitioners, the assessment
> orders which are already revised once, cannot be taken in revision again by
> the revisional authority. In this regard, it is submitted that the said
> contention is not tenable in the eye of law.
2\. On a plain reading of the provisions of Section 75 of the VAT Act, it
would be discernible that the said Section does not debar/restrict the
revisional powers to be exercised more than once, on different issues. If, the
said contention raised by the Petitioners to the effect that once an
assessment order is revised on one issue. then the revisional authority cannot
revise the said assessment orders for another issue also, is accepted, then in
that eventuality, the same would frustrate the intention of the legislature
and would defeat the very purpose of the legislature to provide revisional
powers to  Page 30 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the competent authority, more particularly, in a
situation where the law with respect to different issues get settled at
different points of time.
Thus, with respect to different issues, the assessment orders can be revised
more than once, if the same is within the prescribed period of limitation.
3\. In addition to the above. it is submitted that it is settled principle of
law that the Doctrine of Merger is applicable only to the extent to which the
issue or issues got settled/decided/ forms part of revision, expressly or by
necessary implication. Thus, the issues/controversies which are not forming
the subject matter of revision, the doctrine of merger would not be applicable
and that the colour of the assessment order to the extent of those
unchallenged issues would not get altered.
4\. Pemnently, in the present case, the second revision notice dated
01.09.2018 issued to the Petitioners, is based on altogether different issue
and not related or identical to the issue which was revised earlier vide Order
dated 10.03 2016. In other words, the controversy sought to be raised in the
present notice in question is admittedly based on an issue. which was never
taken in appeal or revision by any of the parties. In view thereof, except for
the issue which was revised vide order dated
10.O3.2016, the revisional authority would not be debarred/ restricted from
exercising its revisional powers upon all other issues. Even under the Civil
law, action in regard to a property challenged in the subsequent suit based
upon different cause of action, is not barred on the ground of the earlier
suit having been filed for the same property but in respect of another cause
of action. Thus, consideration of 0rder 2 Rule 2 of CPC or waiver. estoppel,
or constructive res-judicata do not apply to such an eventuality, which exists
in the present case.
5\. As far as the judgments viz. (14A) OCL India Ltd. Vs. State of Orissa,
reported in (2003) 130 STC 35, and (14B) Malavia Bros. & Co. Vs. Sales Tax
Officer, reported in 1973 GSTB 206, relied upon by the Petitioners are
concerned, the same would also not be applicable to the facts of the present
case. In the first case referred to above, it was held that once the Assistant
Commissioner, as a delegatee of the Commissioner, had revised the  Page 31 of
152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
order of the Sales Tax Officer, then in that case, the Commissioner, as a
delegator, could not have exercised the power of revision once over again as
the same having been exhausted in the first Instance. Whereas in the second
case referred to above, the Revisional Authority was seeking to revise in
respect of the same subject matter, which was already settled either in
revision or appeal. As against this, as aforesaid, in the present case, the
notice in question is altogether on different issue and admittedly, not on the
same subject/issue, which was revised earlier."
49\. As regards the amendment in the repealed enactment, the submissions of
Mr. Trivedi are as under;
> "1. It has been contended by the Petitioners that the provisions of the VAT
> Act stand repealed qua all goods, except 6 items which are enumerated in
> Entry 54 of List II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India.
> 2\. In this regard, it is categorically stated that the provisions of the
> VAT Act, more particularly, Section 75 of the VAT Act still exists and that
> the same are not repeated.
> 3\. However, even assuming without admitting that the provisions of VAT Act
> stand repealed all goods but 6 items, then in that also, it is submitted
> that the State Legislature still possesses the power and it is also
> permissible under the law to amend the provisions, which are repealed or not
> in existence. Therefore, it is incorrect to contend that the State
> Legislature seeks to amend the provisions of VAT Act, which are not in
> existence, and hence invalid. "
50 In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Trivedi, the learned counsel
appearing for the State prays that there being no merit in this writ
application, the same be rejected.
ANALYSIS
51\. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the  Page 32 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following
questions fall for our consideration;
(i) Whether Section 84A of the GVAT Act is ultra vires and beyond the
legislative competence of the State under Entry 54 of List II of the seventh
schedule to the Constitution of India?
(ii) Whether by virtue of Article 246A read with Article 366(12A) of the
Constitution of India, the Union and the State Legislatures, both have the
power to make laws with respect to any tax on supply of goods or services or
both, except taxes on the supply of the alcoholic liquor for the human
consumption? . In other words, whether by virtue of Article 246A of the
Constitution of India, the power to make laws with respect to "intra-state'
sale or purchase of goods still exists with the State Legislature even after
the enactment of the 101st Amendment Act of 2016.
(iii) Whether Section 84A of the GVAT Act is manifestly arbitrary and
violative of the Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India?
(iv) Whether the retrospective insertion of Section 84A with effect from
01.04.2006 makes the provision exceedingly arbitrary and unreasonable?
(v) Whether Section 84A of the GVAT Act is a validating Act?
(vi) Whether by virtue of Section 84A of the GVAT Act, it is permissible to
the Department to reopen the assessments which have already attained finality
before such amendment came into force?.

CAV JUDGMENT
(vii) Whether the provisions of the Gujarat Vat Act stand repealed qua all the
goods except the six items enumerated in the Entry 54 of List Ii of the
seventh schedule of the Constitution of India?. In other words, whether the
provisions of the VAT Act more particularly, Section 75 of the Act still
operates and the other provisions cannot be said to be repealed?.
52\. Before adverting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, we
must look into few relevant provisions of the Constitution of India and the
Gujarat Vat Act.
53\. Section 84A of the Act reads thus;
> "84A.Exclusion of period in some cases (1) Notwithstanding anything
> contained in this Act, an issue on which the Appellate Authority or the
> Appellate Tribunal or the High Court has given its decision which is
> prejudicial to the interest of revenue in some other proceedings and an

58\. The newly enacted Article 246A of the Constitution of India reads as
under;
> "Article 246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax:
> (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament

59\. The said erstwhile Entry 54 of List II of the seventh schedule also came
to be amended vide the 101st Constitution Amendment Act, 2016 and the amended
Entry 54 reads as under:-
> "54. Taxes on the sale of petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit

61\. Sections 142(6) and 142(7) of the GST Act reads as under;

62\. At this stage, it would not be out of place to incorporate the statement
of objects and reasons for the enactment of Section 84A of the Gujarat Vat
Act.
> "STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS After implementation of the Gujarat Value

63\. Section 174 of the GGST Act, which provides for the "repeal and savings"
reads thus;

CAV JUDGMENT
"174. Repeal and Savings;
(1) The repeal of the Acts specified in section shall not:-
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time of such amendment or
repeal; or
(b) affect the previous operation of the amended Acts or repealed Acts and
orders or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued or

Gujarat General Clauses Bom. 1 of 1904 with regard to the effect of repeal."
64\. The Constitution (One hundred and first Amendment) Act, 2016 introduced
the Goods and Services Tax regime in India. It sought to replace all indirect
taxes levied on goods and services by the Union as well as the State
Governments. It came to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on manufacture,
sale or consumption of goods and services. The Act of 2016 inserted Article
246A, 269A and 279A to the Constitution of India. It amended the provisions of
Article 286 of the Constitution. It deleted Entry 92 and 92C of List I of the
Seventh Schedule and inserted Entry 84 of List I and Entry 54 of the List II
of the Seventh Schedule. In tune with the constitutional amendments
incorporated, Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, Integrated Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017 and the respective State Goods and Services Tax Act,
2017 were enacted.
65\. Article 246A of the Constitution of India makes special provision with
respect to Goods and Services Tax. It empowers the Parliament and the
Legislature of every State subject to Article 246A(2) and notwithstanding
anything contained in Articles 246 and 254, to make laws with respect to Goods
and Services Tax imposed by the Union or the State. Article 246A(2) recognises
the exclusive power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to Goods and
Services Tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in
course of inter-state trade or commerce. Article 269A deals with levy and
collection of Goods and Services Tax in course of inter-state trade or
commerce. Essentially, Article 269A recognises the Government of India to
collect Goods and Services Tax on  Page 42 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT supplies in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce. It allows the apportionment of the tax levied
and collected between the Union and the States as may be provided by
Parliament by law. It recognises the authority of the Parliament by law to
formulate the principles for determining the place of supply and when a supply
of goods or of services or both takes place in the course of inter-state trade
or commerce. Article 279A deals with Goods and Services Tax Council. It
envisages the Constitution of a Goods and Services Tax Council. It enumerates
the powers and functions of such Council, the decision making process therein
and the establishment of a mechanism to adjudicate any disputes.
66\. Effect of repeal at Common Law - Repeal obliterates the statute as if it
has never been enacted 66.1 Under the common law, a statute after its repeal
is completely obliterated as if it has never been enacted, except as to the
transactions past and closed.
66.2 Craies on Statute Law, 7th Edition at pages 411-412 states the principle
as under:
> "When an Act of Parliament is repealed, "said Lord Tenterden in Surtees V.
> Ellison," it must be considered (except as to transactions past and closed)
> as if it had never existed. That is the general rule. Tindal C.J. stated
> title exception more widely. He said: "The effect of repealing a statute is
> to be obliterate it as completely from the records of the Parliament as if
> it had never been passed and it must be considered as a law that never
> existed except for the purpose of those action which were commenced,
> prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law."

66.3 Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, 6th Edition at Pg 276 explains the
effect of repeal as under -
> "Effect of repeal At common law the repeal of an Act makes it as if it had
> never been, except as to matters past and closed. ....
> Thus anything done after the repeal in purported exercise of a repealed
> provision is a nullity."
66.4 A seven judge bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Keshavan Madhava
Menon v. State of Bombay, 1951 AIR 128 referred to a passage from the
Crawford's book on Statutory Construction which reads as under:
> "it is well settled that if a statute giving a special remedy is repealed
> without a saving clause in favour of pending suits all suits must stop where
> the repeal firnds them. If final relief has not been granted before the
> repeal went into effect, it cannot be after, if a case is appealed, and
> pending the appeal the law is changed, the appellate court must dispose of
> the case under the law in force when its decision was rendered. The effect
> of the repeal is to obliterate the statute repealed as completely as if it
> had never been passed, and it must be considered as a law which never
> existed, except for the purposes of those actions or suits which were
> commenced, prosecuted and concluded while it was an existing law. Pending
> judicial proceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.
> This rule holds true until the proceedings have reached a final judgement in
> the court of last resort, for that court, when it comes to announce its
> decision, conforms it to the law then existing and may therefore reverse a
> judgement which was correct when pronounced in the subordinate tribunal from
> which whence the appeal was taken, if it appears that pending the appeal a
> statute which was necessary to support the judgement of the lower court has
> been withdrawn by an absolute repeal." (P. 601).

....emphasis supplied 66.5 Justice G.P. Singh in his Principles of Statutory
Interpretation, 12th Edition 2010, while examining the consequences of repeal
has stated as following at page 695.
> "Under the common law rule the consequences of repeal of a statute are very
> drastic. Except as to transactions past and closed, a statute after its
> repeal is as completely obliterated as if it had never been enacted. The
> effect is to destroy all inchoate rights and all causes of action that may
> have arisen under the repealed statute. Therefore, leaving aside the cases
> where proceedings were commenced, prosecuted and brought to a finality
> before the repeal, no proceeding under the repealed statute can be commenced
> or continued after the repeal."
66.6 The Apex Court in Mohan Raj Vs. Dimbeswari Saikia & Anr, AIR 2007, SC
232, has quoted the above passage with approval in paragraph 23 which is
quoted below:
> "23.It is now well settled that such Repealing Act shall be construed to
> have not taken away the accrued right of a person. In G.P. Singh's
> Principles of Statutory Interpretation (10th Edn.) 2006 at Page 631, it is
> stated: "Under the common law rule the consequences of repeal of a statute

> before the repeal, no proceeding under the repealed statute can be commenced
> or continued after the repeal."
66.7 The aforesaid principle is reiterated in the Constitution  Page 45 of 152

Bench decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kolhapur Canesugar Works
Ltd v. Union of India \- 2000 (119) ELT 257 (SC).
66.8 Thus, at common law, a statute become non-existent on its repeal, unless
saved by some saving provision.
67\. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act - abrogates the Common Law effect of
repeal 67.1 To prevent the drastic effect of obliteration of statute on its
repeal and to save the rights acquired or liabilities incurred, the savings
clauses are provided in the repealing statutes.
67.2 Apart from that, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides a
general savings. The section reads as under:
> "6. Effect of repeal -
> Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement
> of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made,
> then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not:
> (a) Revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal
> takes effect; or
> (b) Affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything
> duly done or suffered thereunder; or
> (c) Affect any right privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or

> (d) Affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any

> CAV JUDGMENT may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty,
> forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or
> Regulation had not been passed."
67.3 The aforesaid provision will apply to repeal of any enactment by a
Central Act, unless a different intention appears from the repealing Act. The
section inter alia provides that repeal shall not affect the previous
operation of any enactment so repealed, anything duly done or suffered; or
affect any rights, privileges, obligations or liabilities acquired, accrued or
incurred under the repealed enactment; or affect penalty, forfeiture or
punishment incurred or investigation, legal proceedings in respect of right,
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment.
1\. 68. The term 'repeal' is used when the entire act is abrogated. The term
'amendment' is used when a portion of an Act is repealed and re-enacted. There
is no real distinction between them. Repeal thus includes partial repeal.
68.1 The use of any particular form of words is not necessary to bring about a
repeal. All that is necessary is that the words should indicate the intention
to abrogate the Act or provision in question. The word 'repeal' is usually
used when the entire Act is sought to be abrogated. However, when the object
is to repeal only a portion of an Act, the term 'omission' is used. Further,
where the object is to repeal a part and re-enact another provision in its
place, the term 'amendment' is used.

68.2 The above principle has been explained by the Supreme Court in the case
of Bhagat Ram Sharma v. Union of India, AIR 1988 SC 740 as under:
> "It is a matter of legislative practice to provide while enacting an
> amending law, that an existing provision shall be deleted and a new
> provision substituted. Such deletion has the effect of repeal of the
> existing provision. Such a law may also provide for the introduction of a
> new provision. There is no real distinction between 'repeal' and an
> 'amendment'. In Sutherland's Statutory Construction, 3 edn., vol. 1 at p.
> 477, the learned author rd makes the following statement of law:
> "The distinction between repeal and amendment as these terms are used by the
> Courts is arbitrary. Naturally the use of these terms by the Court is based
> largely on how the Legislatures have developed and applied these terms in
> labelling their enactments. When a section is being added to an Act or a
> provision added to a section, the Legislatures commonly entitle the Act as
> an amendment... When a provision is withdrawn from a section, the
> Legislatures call the Act an amendment, particularly when a provision is
> added to replace the one withdrawn. However, when an entire Act or section
> is abrogated and no new section is added to replace it, Legislatures label
> the Act accomplishing this result a repeal. Thus as used by the
> Legislatures, amendment and repeal may differ in kind addition as opposed to
> withdrawal or only in degree-abrogation of part of a section as opposed to
> abrogation of a whole section or Act; or more commonly, in both kind and
> degree-addition of a provision to a section to replace a provision being
> abrogated as opposed by abrogation of a whole section of an Act. This
> arbitrary distinction has been followed by the Courts, and they have
> developed separate rules of construction for each. However, they have
> recognized that frequently an Act purporting to be an amendment has the same
> qualitative effect as a repeal - the abrogation of an existing statutory
> provision- and have therefore applied the term 'implied repeal' and the
> rules of construction applicable to repeals to such amendments.

CAV JUDGMENT
> Amendment is, in fact, a wider term and it includes abrogation or deletion
> of a provision in an existing statute. If the amendment of an existing law
> is small, the Act professes to amend; if it is extensive, it repeals a law
> and re-enacts it."
68.3 Further, in the case of Fibre Boards (P) Ltd v. CIT Bangalore, 2015 (8)
TMI 482 - SC, the Supreme Court held that there is no distinction between
'repeal' and 'omission'. Similar dictum is laid in the case of Shree Bhagwati
Steel Rolling Mills v. Commir. Of Central Excise, 2015 (326) ELT 2019 (SC).
68.4 Accordingly, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will also apply
to the omission, amendment, substitution, etc. which repeals a part of an Act
or partially repeals an Act.
69\. Applicability of the General Clauses Act, 1897 for the interpretation of
the Constitution 69.1 Article 367(1) of the Constitution states that the
General Clauses Act, 1897 (subject to the adaptations and modification made
under Article 372) shall apply for the interpretation of the Constitution. The
relevant extract is as under:
> "367.(1) Unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act,
> 1897, shall, subject to any adaptations and modifications that may be made
> therein under Article 372, apply for the interpretation of this Constitution
> as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of the Legislature of the
> Dominion of India."
69.2 Thus, the General Clause Act applies only for the interpretation of
constitution. The General Clauses Act defines  Page 49 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT various terms in
section 3. These definitions will apply for the interpretation when these
words are employed in the Constitution. Apart from the definition, Section 16
(power to appoint to include power to suspend or dismiss), Section 21 (Power
to issue to include power to add to, amend, vary or rescind Notification,
Orders, Rules or Bye-laws), etc. which are general rules of construction and
which are otherwise in accord with the common law may also apply for the
interpretation of the Constitution.
69.3 Therefore, perhaps, the other matters such as the savings in the case of
repeal (Section 6), revival of repeal enactments (Section 7), construction of
references to the repealed enactments (Section 8), continuation of order
issued under the repealed enactment and re-enacted (Section 24), etc. which
are not related to interpretation may not apply by virtue of Article 367.
69.4 Further, Section 6 applies only to repeal of an enactment. Enactment is
defined under Section 3(19) of the General Clauses Act to include regulation
or any provision contained in any Act or regulation. However, Constitution is
not an enactment. The Constitution is supreme and is, in fact, the foundation
of all the enactment. This has been observed by the Law Commission in its 60th
Report on the General Clauses Act, 1897 in the context of Section 8
(construction of references of repealed enactment). The relevant extract of
the report is as under:
> "1.30.Effect of section 8 on Article 367.- Will section 8 of the General
> Clauses Act, which provides that when  Page 50 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
> Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT an enactment is
> repealed and re-enacted, references to the old enactment will be construed
> as references to that, re-enacted one, make any difference? We do not think
> so. It should be noted that the words "unless the context otherwise
> requires" (in Article 367) mean that the General Clauses Act, section 8, is
> to be excluded. Even by its terms, section 8 of the General Clauses Act will
> not apply to the Constitution, because expression "enactment" (which occurs
> in section
> 8) would not take in the Constitution, which is not an "enactment". The
> Constitution is supreme and is, in fact, the foundation of all enactments."
69.5 Thus, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will not apply to the
Constitution (contrary view taken by the Allahabad High Court in the case of
Farzand v. Mohand, AIR 1968 All 67(73). However, no reasoning has been given
to apply Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to the Constitution.) 69.6
The above principle about the non-applicability of the General Clauses Act,
1897 is relevant and applicable even to the Constitutional Amendment Acts as
they are made by the Parliament in exercise of its constituent powers under
Article 368 and not in exercise of normal legislative powers under Article 245
of the Constitution.
69.7 The question as to whether Section 6 applies to the Constitution is
relevant to determine whether after the repeal of the Entry in the legislative
list, the laws made in pursuance of such legislative powers can be saved. That
provision has presently been made under Section 19 of the Constitution (One
hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016. Thus, contextually also Section 6 will
not apply to the present case.
70\. Need for Article 372 in the Constitution - Saving of  Page 51 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
laws in force 70.1 Article 395 of the Constitution inter alia repeals the
Government of India Act, 1935. The repeal of the Government of India Act, 1935
may have the effect that all the previous Acts passed under it may cease to
operate.
70.2 Accordingly, Article 372 of the Constitution provides for continuance of
the existing laws in force on repeal of the Government of India Act, 1935. The
relevant extract of the said Article is as under:
> "372. Continuance in force of existing laws and their adaptation (1)
> Notwithstanding the repeal by this Constitution of the enactments referred
> to in Article 395 but subject to the other provisions of this Constitution,
> all the laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the
> commencement of this Constitution, all the laws in force in the territory of
> India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall
> continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a
> competent Legislature or other competent authority."
70.3 The objective behind the enactment of Article 372 was explained by Durga
Das Basu in his Commentary on the Constitution of India (First Edition) at
page 726-727 as under:
> "The general rule is that with the repeal of a statute, all bye-laws made
> thereunder cease to be valid, unless there is a saving clause in the new
> statute, preserving the old bye-laws. On this principle, laws passed under
> the previous Government Acts would have ceased to operate on the
> commencement of this Constitution, by reason of Art. 395, post.
> The object of the prevent clause is to sanction the  Page 52 of 152
> Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
> continuance of the existing laws until they are repealed or amended by a
> competent authority under the new constitution."
70.4 The Supreme Court in the case of South India Corporation v. Secretary,
Board of Revenue, 1964 AIR 207, in the context of Article 372 observed as
under:
> "The object of this article is to maintain the continuity of the pre-
> existing laws after the Constitution came into force till they were
> repealed, altered or amended by a competent authority. Without the aid of
> such an article there would be utter confusion in the field of law. The
> assumption underlying the article is that the State laws may or may not be
> within the legislative competence of the appropriate authority under the
> Constitution. The article would become ineffective and purposeless if it was
> held that pre- Constitution laws should be such as could be made by the
> appropriate authority under the Constitution. The words "subject to the
> other provisions of the Constitution" should, therefore, be given a
> reasonable interpretation, an interpretation which would carry out the
> intention of the makers of the Constitution and also which is in accord with
> the constitutional practice in such matters. The article posits the
> continuation of the pre-existing laws made by a competent authority
> notwithstanding the repeal of certain acts under Art. 395; and the
> expression "other" in the article can only apply to provisions other than
> those dealing with legislative competence."
70.5 Thus, in the absence of Article 372 in the Constitution, perhaps the laws
enacted under the Government of India Act, 1935 would have ceased to operate.
Article 372 saves the operation of such laws.
71\. Need for Article 277 in the Constitution - Saving of laws which become
inconsistent with the changes in the matters enumerated in the Legislative
lists in Schedule  Page 53 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT VII.
71.1 Apart from the repeal of the Government of India Act, 1935, the
Constitution also made some changes in the subject matters allocated to the
legislature for enacting laws. Thus, some of the matters within the
legislative competence of the Government of State were shifted to the Union
List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.
71.2 Accordingly, to save taxes, duties, cesses or fees which prior to the
commencement of the Constitution were lawfully being levied by the Government
of State and the subject matter to which they relate has been now mentioned in
the Union List, Article 227 was enacted. The relevant extract of the said
article is as under:
> "277. Savings Any taxes, duties, cesses or fees which, immediately before
> the comencement of this Constitution, were being lawfully levied by the
> Government of any State or by any municipality or other local authority or
> body for the purposes of the State, municipality, district or other local
> area may, notwithstanding that those taxes, duties, cesses or fees are
> mentioned in the Union List, continue to be levied and to be applied to the
> same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by Parliament by law."
71.3 The analogous provision to Article 277 in the Government of India Act,
1935 was Section 143(2). The Supreme Court in the case of Ram Krishna Ramanath
v. The Janpad Sabha, Gondia, 1962 AIR 1073 held that Section 143(2) is a
saving clause designed to prevent dislocation of finances of local government
by the reason of distribution of heads of taxation on different lines. The
relevant extract of the judgement is as  Page 54 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT under:
> "Section 143 (2) which is a saving clause and obviously, designed, to
> prevent a dislocation of the finances of Local Governments and of local
> authorities by reason of the coming into force of the provisions of the
> Government of India Act distributing heads of taxation on lines different
> from those which prevailed before that date, cannot be construed as one
> conferring a plenary power to legislate on those topics till such time as
> the Central Legislature intervened."
71.4 The aforesaid provision is needed, apart from the general savings in
Article 372, as Article 372 is subject to the other provisions of the
Constitution. If Article 277 was not enacted, a doubt may arise whether the
laws enacted by the Government of State prior to the constitution would become
inconsistent with Article 246 due to the heads of taxation being shifted to
the Union List.
71.5 Thus, to put the matter beyond any doubt, Article 277 saves the laws
relating to taxes, duties, cesses or fees even though they are inconsistent
with the provisions of the Constitution until provision to the contrary is
made by the Parliament.
72\. Unconnected ancillary matter - Whether Section 19 of the Constitution
(One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016 applies to laws relating to
service tax, excise duty, etc. levied by the Parliament.
72.1 Section 19 of the Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act,
2016 reads as under:
Page 55 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
> "19. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any provision of any law relating
> to tax on goods or services or on both in force in any State immediately
> before the commencement of this Act, which is inconsistent with the
> provisions of the Constitution as amended by this Act shall continue to be
> in force until amended or repealed by a competent Legislature or other
> competent authority or until expiration of one year from such commencement,
> whichever is earlier.
....emphasis supplied 72.2 A doubt has been raised as to whether Section 19
will apply to the Central levies such as the service tax, excise duty, etc. as
only the provisions of law in force in any state.
72.3 On a plain reading of the section, it will become clear that the doubt is
entirely unfounded. 'Law.... In force in any State' will include even a law
made by the Parliament as it is in force in the state. The words used are not
'law enacted by state legislature'.
72.4 Thus even the Central levies such as the service tax, etc. will be
covered by Section 19 of the Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment
Act, 2016.
73\. Legislature competent to repeal, alter or amend - The legislature which
has present competence to enact the law sought to be repealed, can repeal such
law. It is irrelevant that the law was enacted by another legislature when it
had the competence.
73.1 The Supreme Court in the case of A. Hajee Abdul  Page 56 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
Shukoor & Co. v. State of Madras - AIR 1964 SC 1729 held that the competence
to make a law for a past period depends on the present legislative power. The
relevant extract of the judgement is as under:
> "The State Legislature is free to enact laws which would have retrospective
> operation. Its competence to make a law for a certain past period, depends
> on its present legislative power and not on what it possessed at the period
> of time when its enactment is to have operation."
73.2 In the case of Kerala State Electricity Board v. Indian Aluminum Co. Ltd.
AIR 1976 SC 1031, the Supreme Court held as under:
> "Both the 1910 Act as well as the 1948 Act are existing law as contemplated
> under Article 372 of the Constitution. An existing law continues to be valid
> even though the legislative power with respect to the subject matter of the
> existing law might be in a different list under the Constitution from the
> list under which it would have fallen under the Government of India Act,
> 1935. But after the Constitution came into force an existing law could be
> amended or repealed only by the legislature which would be competent to
> enact that law if it were to be newly enacted."
73.3 Further, the power to repeal is also co-extensive with the power to
enact. Thus, only the legislature which has the power to enact a law, can
repeal such a law. This was held by the Supreme Court in the case of Rama
krishna Ramanath v. The Janpad Sabha, Gondia, 1962 AIR 1073 as under:
> "There is no doubt that the general principle is that the power of a
> legislative body to repeal a law is co-extensive with its power to enact
> each a law, as would be seen from the following passage in the judgment by
> Lord Watson in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney  Page 57 of 152
> Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
> General for the Dominion:
> "Neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have
> authority to repeal statutes which they could not directly enact."
> 73.4 Thus, the power to repeal or alter an enactment is co-
extensive with the power to enact. The power has to be seen at the time when
the repealing legislation is being enacted. The legislation may be prospective
or retrospective. It can also be made retrospective for the period for which
the legislature did not have the competence. However, the legislature should
have the competence at the time when such a repealing law is being enacted.
74\. Possibility of amendment of a repealed Act, after its repeal when it is
not in operation.
74.1 The Madras High Court in the case of Kalyanam Veerabhadrayya v. King, AIR
1960 Mad 243 held that a repealed Act which is non-existent cannot be amended
unless the competent legislature revives or re-enact the repealed Act and then
make amendments to it.
74.2 The facts in the case before the Madras High Court were these: The
Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1947 was enacted for a period of one year.
However, the Act provided that the Provincial Government is empowered to
extend the operation of the Act beyond the period of one year. This power was
held to be bad as it amounts to delegation of legislative function. The Madras
Maintenance of Public Order Removal of Doubts Ordinance, 1949 was passed to
declare that the Maintenance  Page 58 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT of Public Order Act, 1947
remains in force and shall continue to be in force. In these facts the court
held that the amendments can be made only to an existing Act. However, the
legislature is competent to revive or re-enact the repealed legislation and
make amendments to it. In the facts of that case, the court held that the
legislature had not done so. The relevant extract of the judgement is as
under:
> "An amending Act is not an independent Act but an Act passed with a view to
> effect an improvement or to more effectively carry out the purpose for which
> the original law was passed. To remove doubts by a declaratory Act, there
> should be in existence an Act, the doubts in which have to be removed. It
> the Act had already ceased to be in force, a declaratory Act would have no
> operation. An amending Act also presumes the existence of an original Act.
> If the original Act, which was a temporary Act, terminated after the lapse
> of time, the amending Act would be inoperative."
74.3 For the aforesaid proposition, the court relied on the decision of
Federal Court in the case of Jatindra Nath Gupta v. Province of Bihar, AIR
1949 FC 175 wherein Mukherjee J. held as under:
> "It is certainly competent to the Legislature in exercise of its plenary
> powers to revive or re-enact a legislation which has already expired by
> lapse of time. The Legislature is also competent to legislate with
> retrospective effect; but neither of these things seems to have been done in
> the present case. The Legislature proceeds on the footing that the old Act
> was alive at the date. Then the new Act was passed, and the new Act merely
> purports to amend one of the provisions of the old Act. There could be no
> amendment of an enactment which a not in existence and from the fact that
> the Legislature purports to amend an Act, it could not held as a matter of
> construction that the intention of the  Page 59 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
> Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Legislature was to
> renew a dead Act or make a new enactment on the same terms as the old with
> retrospective effect."
74.4 However, in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal Pindwal, AIR 1996
SC 2181, the Supreme Court held that retrospective amendments can be made to
the repealed statutes in respect of the transactions past and closed. The
judgement has been summarised in Justice GP Singh's Principles of Statutory
Interpretation, 14th Edition at page 757- 758 as under:
> "Since repeal of a law takes effect from the date of repeal and the law
> repealed remains in operation for the period before its repeal without
> assistance of nay saving clause for transaction past and closed, it can be
> retrospectively amended to affect such transactions even after its repeal.
> Thus, when Rule B made under Article 309 of the Constitution substitutes
> Rule A, which in effect means that A is repealed and B is enacted in its
> place, A can be amended retrospectively for the period during which it was
> in operation to validate transactions past and closed. In the case from
> which the above principle is deduced, a rule permitted compulsory retirement
> of a Government servant by paying three months salary. This rule was later
> repealed by substituting another rule in its place. During the period the
> earlier rule was in operation, a Government service was retired in payment
> of an amount as salary but which was found on calculation later to be little
> short of three months salary making the retirement invalid. The rule was
> after its repeal amended for the period it was in operation to retire a
> Government servant forthwith without paying him three months salary but
> entitling him to claim three months salary after retirement. This amendment
> was held to be valid and effective to validate the retirement of the
> Government servant concerned. "

CAV JUDGMENT
74.5 The above referred cases, however, are not concerned with the competence
of the legislature to enact retrospective laws, but only with the issue as to
whether the amendments can be made to the repealed laws.
75\. Repeal of the State VAT Act is not effected by the Constitution (One
Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016\. Repeal is effected by the State GST
Acts. Such Acts provide for savings of the pending proceedings. Thus,
assessments can be initiated, continued and concluded in pursuance of such
saving clause contained in the respective GST laws.
75.1 In respect of the pending assessments, they can be initiated, continued
and concluded. This is because while repealing the VAT Acts by the State GST
Act, specific savings have been provided in this regard.
75.2 This provision can perhaps be traced to Section 19 of the Constitution
(One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016. Section 19 is not some section
enacted under an Act of Parliament or State Legislature. It is a part of the
constitution amendment Act and has to be read as an addendum to the
Constitution.
75.3 Section 19 provides that the laws relating to the goods and services tax
which are inconsistent with the amended Constitution shall continue until
amended or repealed by a competent legislature. It is a debatable issue as to
who is the competent legislature for the purpose of Section 19: the State
Legislature or Parliament?
Page 61 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
75.4 It is argued on behalf of the State that the law relates to tax on sales,
which may be covered within the ambit of Article 24CA. It has been argued that
the State Legislature will be a competent legislature for the purpose of
Section 19.
75.5 Further, Section 19 can be said to be an independent and limited
legislative power to repeal the earlier enactments. Such power will also
include all ancillary powers necessary to exercise the main powers. Further,
as this is an independent power, by necessary implication it may exclude the
applicability of other articles such as Article 286, Article 279A, etc. Thus,
the saving clause can also be enacted in exercise of such power to save the
initiation, continuation and conclusion of assessments.
76\. Which is the legislature competent to amend the laws relating to the
Sales Tax after the Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016?
State Legislature or Parliament?
76.1 Article 245 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament may make
laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the Legislature
of a State can make laws for the whole or any part of the State.
76.2 Article 245 is the fountain source of the power. In other words, both the
Parliament and State legislature are supreme and none is the delegate of
another.
76.3 Article 246 read with the Seventh Schedule only  Page 62 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
demarcates the fields of the legislation. However, within their competence,
each legislature has plenary powers. Further, while enacting laws which are
within their competence, the Parliament or State Legislature can also make
laws for the matter which are ancillary to the main matters.
76.4 Thus, to determine the validity of a law, the provisions of the
Constitution have to be seen to determine whether the legislature enacting the
law has necessary competence to enact such law.
76.5 The Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016 inter alia
substituted Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution to
confine it to the "Taxes on the sale of petroleum crude, high speed diesel,
motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas, aviation turbine fuel
and alcoholic liquor for human consumption'.
76.6 The substitution of Entry 54 amounts to repeal of the old entry and
subsequent enactment of the new entry. In absence of any saving clause, the
old entry will become non existent as if it had never been in the
Constitution, except for the transactions past and closed. However, Section 19
of the Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016 saves the laws
which are inconsistent with the amended constitution until amended or repealed
by competent legislature or expiration of one year of the commencement of
Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016, whichever is
earlier.
76.7 The legislature competent to amend or repeal is the legislative which has
the power to enact such law after the  Page 63 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr
16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT amendment of the
Constitution.
> "RELEVANCE OF ARTICLE 246A:
> Restriction placed on State legislature in respect of laws relating to sales
> tax by Article 286 and other provisions of the Constitution prior to the
> 101st Constitution Amendment Act."
76.8 Article 246(3) of the Constitution provides that the State Legislature
has the exclusive power to make laws for such state or any part thereof in
respect of any matters enumerated in the List II of the Seventh Schedule.
76.9 The Entry 54 of the List II reads as: 'Taxes on the sale or purchase of
goods other than newspaper subject to the provisions of entry 92A of List I.'
Entry 92A of List I read as: 'Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other
than newspapers, where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of
inter -State trade or commerce'.
76.10 Thus, the State Legislature could make laws for taxes on sale or
purchase of goods other than those taking place in the course of inter - state
trade or commerce. Article 269(3) of the Constitution provided that the
Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale or
purchase takes place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. Section 3
of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 was enacted in pursuance of this power.
76.11 The other restrictions were placed by Article 286 of the Constitution
(as it stood post Constitution Sixth Amendment Act and before its amendment by
Constitution  Page 64 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT One Hundred and First Amendment Act).
76.12 Prior to the One Hundred and First Amendment of the Constitution,
Article 286 of the Constitution had stood as follows:;
> "286. (1) No law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a
> tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes
> place--
> (a) outside the State; or
> (b) in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods
> out of, the territory of India.
> (2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale
> or purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1).
> (3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes, or authorises the

76.13 In Article 286 of the Constitution, vide the Constitution (One Hundred
and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the following amendments were made, namely:-
> "13. In article 286 of the Constitution,--
> (I) In clause (1),--
Page 65 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
> (A) for the words "the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase
> takes place", the words "the supply of goods or of services or both, where
> such supply takes place" shall be substituted;
> (B) in sub-clause (b), for the word "goods", at both the places where it
> occurs, the words "goods or services or both" shall be substituted;
> (ii) in clause (2), for the words "sale or purchase of goods takes place",
> the words "supply of goods or of services or both" shall be substituted;
> (iii) clause (3) shall be omitted."
76.14 After the amendments made by the said Constitution Amendment Act, the
Article 286 stands as follows:
> "286. (1) No law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a
> tax on the supply of goods or of services or both, where such supply takes
> place--
> (a) outside the State; or
> (b) in the course of the import of the goods or services or both into, or
> export of the goods or services or both out of, the territory of India.
> (2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a supply
> of goods or of services or both in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1)."
76.15 Here, two things are important. First is that the Constitution nowhere
provides that the Legislatures of the States can make law for imposing goods
and services tax on the intra-State supply of goods or services or both.
Secondly, the Constitution does not give powers to the Parliament for
formulating principles for the purpose of determining which supplies shall be
an intra-State supply of goods or services or  Page 66 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT both. The powers of
Legislatures of States can be derived from Article 246A (1) read with Article
246A (2) and Article 286. There is no other provision in the Constitution
which either confer the GST Law making the powers or curtails such law making
powers of the Legislatures of the States. However, unless Clause (1) of
Article 246A takes effect in relation to the petroleum crude, high speed
diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation
turbine fuel, the Parliament and the Legislatures of the States, both, cannot
make the law providing levy of goods and services tax (GST) on supply of these
goods.
76.16 Thus, a law of a state cannot impose tax on sale or purchase of goods
which takes place (a) outside the state or
(b) in the course of the import into or export out of India. Clause (2)
provides that the Parliament may formulate the principles for determining when
a sale or purchase takes place in the ways mentioned in clause (1).
76.17 Section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 has been enacted in
exercise of the powers under Article 286(1)(a) read with clause (2). Section 5
of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 has been enacted in exercise of the powers
under Article 286(1)(b) read with clause (2).
76.18 Thus, any state law imposing tax on sale or purchase of goods has to
comply with the provisions of Article 269(3), Article 286(1)(a) and Article
286(1)(b).
Restriction on the State legislature in respect of the laws relating to goods
and services tax after the 101 st  Page 67 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Constitution Amendment Act.
76.19 The Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act, 2016 made
various changes in the Constitution with regard to the power to make laws
relating to the goods and services tax.
76.20 Article 246A has been inserted which provides for power to make laws
relating to goods or services tax simultaneously to the Parliament and the
State Legislature. The relevant extract of the said Article is as under:
> "246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax (1)
> Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
> subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make
> laws with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such
> State.
> (2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and
> services tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place
> in the course of inter-State trade or commerce".
76.21 Thus, both the State Legislature and the Parliament has the power to
make laws with respect to the goods and services tax. However, the Parliament
has the exclusive power to make laws with respect to the goods and services
tax where the supply takes place in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce.
76.22 Article 296(5) of the Constitution provides that the Parliament may by
law formulate the principles for determining when a supply takes place in the
course of inter-state trade or  Page 68 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT commerce. The said Article
reads as under:
> "(5)Parliament may, by law, formulate the principles for determining the
> place of supply, and when a supply of goods, or of services, or both takes
> place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce."
76.23 The Parliament has accordingly enacted, the Integrated Goods and Service
Tax Act, 2017, Sections 7 and 8 respectively of which provides the principles
for determining when a supply takes place in the course of inter - state trade
or commerce.
76.24 Further Article 286 also places some restriction on imposition of tax on
the supply of goods or services or both. The Article provides that no law of a
state shall authorize the imposition of tax on supply of goods and services or
both where such supply takes place outside the state or in the course of the
import into or export out of the territory of India. The relevant extract
reads as under:
> "286. Restriction as to imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods:-
> (1) No law of a State shall impose, or authorize the imposition of, a tax on
> the supply of goods or of services or both, where such supply takes place-
> (a) outside the State; or
> (b) in the course of the import of the goods or services or both into, or
> export of the goods or services or both out of, the territory of India.
> (2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a supply
> of goods or of services or both in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1)."
76.25 Further, Article 279A provides for the constitution of a Goods and
Services Tax Council which shall make recommendations on all matters relating
to the goods and  Page 69 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT services tax.
76.26 It may not be out of place to note that the residuary power of the
Parliament under Article 248 of the Constitution to make laws with respect to
any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List has also been
subject to Article 246A.
76.27 Thus, both the State legislature and the Parliament have simultaneous
power to make laws relating to goods and services tax under Article 246A.
77\. Amendment of State VAT Acts now made after the 101st Amendment Act for
the period when the VAT Acts were in force, can perhaps be made only by the
Legislature which has the present competence over the subject matter and it
should be in accordance with the present provisions of the Constitution! 77.1
As seen above the competence to make a law even for a past period depends on
the present legislative power. After the amendment of the Constitution, both
the Parliament and State Legislature have the competence to enact laws
relating to the goods and services tax.
77.2 However, the exercise of the power is circumscribed by other provisions
of the Constitution such as Article 246A(2) read with Article 269A(5) which
relates to supply in the course of inter-state trade or commerce, Article 286
which relates to restriction on imposition of tax by law made by a state on
supply taking place outside the state, in the course of import  Page 70 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
into or export out of territory of India and Article 279A which related to
recommendations of the GST Council. Thus, the powers can be exercised only
after complying with such provisions of the Constitution.
77.3 We have our own doubts whether an amendment to the VAT Act (which was
originally enacted complying with the erstwhile Article 286 and Article 269(3)
can now also comply with the new Article 246A(2), Article 269A(5) and Article
286 respectively.
77.4 Further, to what extent the aspects of taxation such as the sale, entry
into local area, manufacture, etc. will be covered within the ambit of laws
relating to the goods or service tax is also not amply clear. In other words,
the State Legislature can make amendments to the earlier VAT Acts, Entry Tax
Acts only if such aspects can be traced to Article 246A of the Constitution.
77.5 Section 19 of the Constitution (One Hundred and First) Amendment Act,
2016 can also not be a source of power to amend the State VAT laws. First, the
power to amend under Section 19 is only for a period of one year from the
commencement of the amendment act.
77.6 Secondly, the words used in Section 19 are that the laws inconsistent
with the new provisions of Constitution 'shall continue to be in force'. The
Supreme Court in the case of Ram Krishna Ramanath v. The Janpad Sabha, Gondia
AIR 1962 SC 1073 held that the Provincial Legislature which was competent to
enact laws prior to the Government of India  Page 71 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Act, 1935 has a
limited legislative power by virtue of Section 143(2) of the Government of
India Act, 1935 (which is analogous to Article 277 of the Constitution). This
was because the words used was 'may be continued until provision to the
contrary is made by the Federal Legislature'. The Supreme Court construed the
words 'may' in the phrase to mean 'may continue to be levied if so desire by
the Provincial Legislature'. Accordingly, the Supreme Court found a limited
legislative power in the Provincial Legislature to repeal the Act or to reduce
the rate of tax but not to increase the burden by enhancing the rate of tax.
77.7 However, the above case may not apply to the present case as the words
used in Section 19 of the Constitution (one Hundred and First) Amendment Act,
2016 are that the laws shall continue to be in force.
77.8 It is settled principle that the legislative power of the State
legislature is plenary. They are not delegate of the Parliament. However, this
principle is relevant only when the threshold question on the competence to
legislate with respect to subject matter is in favour of the State
Legislature.
78\. The Supreme Court in the case of Union of India & Anr. vs. Mohit Mineral
Private Limited, (2019) 2 SCC 599, had the occasion to consider the challenge
to the validity of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act,
2017 enacted by the Parliament as well as the Goods and Services Tax
Compensation Rules, 2017. While considering such challenge, the Supreme Court
considered Article 246A quite in details. We quote the relevant paras;
Page 72 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
"21. First, we need to notice relevant constitutional provisions and the
Parliamentary enactments relevant for the issues raised in these cases.
22\. Part XII of the Constitution deals with Finance. Article 265 provides
that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. Article
366 contains definitions. Article 366(26A) defines "services" as "services
means anything other than goods". Whereas Article 366 (29A) contains an
inclusive definition of "tax on the sale or purchase of goods". A Bill was
introduced in the Lok Sabha namely, the Constitution (One Hundred and
TwentySecond Amendment) Bill, 2014 on 19.12.2014 proposing constitutional
amendments to introduce the goods and services tax for conferring concurrent
taxing powers on the Union as well as the States including Union territory
with Legislature to make laws for levying goods and services tax on every
transaction of supply of goods or services or both. Statement of Objects and
Reasons of the Bill are as follows:"
STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Constitution is proposed to be amended to
introduce the goods and services tax for conferring concurrent taxing powers
on the Union as well as the States including Union territory with Legislature
to make laws for levying goods and services tax on every transaction of supply
of goods or services or both. The goods and services 14 tax shall replace a
number of indirect taxes being levied by the Union and the State Governments
and is intended to remove cascading effect of taxes and provide for a common
national market for goods and services. The proposed Central and State goods
and services tax will be levied on all transactions involving supply of goods
and services, except those which are kept out of the purview of the goods and
services tax.
2\. The proposed Bill, which seeks further to amend the Constitution, inter
alia, provides for--
(a) subsuming of various Central indirect taxes and levies such as Central
Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duties, Excise Duty levied under the Medicinal
and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, Service Tax,  Page 73 of
152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, Special
Additional Duty of Customs, and Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they
relate to the supply of goods and services;
(b) subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other
than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the
Centre and collected by the States), Octroi and Entry tax, Purchase Tax,
Luxury tax, Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling; and State cesses and
surcharges in so far as they relate to supply of goods and services;
(c) dispensing with the concept of 'declared goods of special importance'
under the Constitution;
(d) levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on inter- State transactions of
goods and services;
(e) levy of an additional tax on supply of goods, not exceeding one per cent.
in the course of inter-State trade or commerce to be collected by the
Government of India for a period of two years, and assigned to the States from
where the supply originates;
(f) conferring concurrent power upon Parliament and the State Legislatures to
make laws governing goods and services tax;
(g) coverage of all goods and services, except alcoholic liquor for human
consumption, for the levy of goods and services tax. In case of petroleum and
petroleum products, it has been provided that these goods shall not be subject
to the levy of Goods and Services Tax till a date notified on the
recommendation of the Goods and Services Tax Council.
(h) compensation to the States for loss of revenue arising on account of
implementation of the Goods and Services Tax for a period which may extend to
five years;"
23\. The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 dated
08.09.2016 was passed to amend the Constitution of India. By Constitution (One
Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, new Articles 246A, 269A  Page 74 of
152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
and 279A were inserted. Amendments were also made in Articles 248, 249, 250,
268, 269, 270, 271, 286, 366 and
368\. Article 268A was omitted. Amendments were also made in Seventh Schedule
of the Constitution in List I and List II.
Article 246A and 269A as inserted by Constitution (One Hundred and First
Amendment) Act, 2016 is as follows:"
246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax.(1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws
with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and
services tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in
the course of inter-State trade or commerce Explanation.--The provisions of
this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in
clause (5) of article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods
and Services Tax Council.".
269A. Levy and Collection of goods and services tax in course of inter-State
trade or commerce.(1) Goods and services tax on supplies in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce shall be levied and collected by the Government
of India and such tax shall be apportioned between the Union and the States in
the manner as may be provided by Parliament by law on the recommendations of
the Goods and Services Tax Council.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this clause, supply of goods, or of
services, or both in the course of import into the territory of India shall be
deemed to be supply of goods, or of services, or both in the course of inter-
State trade or commerce.
(2) The amount apportioned to a State under clause (1) shall not form part of
the Consolidated Fund of India.
(3) Where an amount collected as tax levied under clause  Page 75 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT (1)
has been used for payment of the tax levied by a State under article 246A,
such amount shall not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India.
(4) Where an amount collected as tax levied by a State under article 246A has
been used for payment of the tax levied under clause (1), such amount shall
not form part of the Consolidated Fund of the State.
(5) Parliament may, by law, formulate the principles for determining the place
of supply, and when a supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in
the course of inter-State trade or commerce.".
24\. Article 270 of the constitution as amended by the above Amendment Act is
as follows:"
270.Taxes levied and distributed between the Union and the States.(1) All
taxes and duties referred to in the Union List, except the duties and taxes
referred to in Articles 268, 269 and 269A, respectively, surcharge on taxes
and duties referred to in Article 271 and any cess levied for specific
purposes under any law made by Parliament shall be levied and collected by the
Government of India and shall be distributed between the Union and the States
in the manner provided in clause (2)."
25\. Section 18 and Section 19 of the Constitution (One Hundred and First
Amendment) Act, 2016 is also relevant, which are to the following effect:"
18\. Compensation to States for loss of revenue on account of introduction of
goods and services tax.Parliament shall, by law, on the recommendation of the
Goods and Services Tax Council, provide for compensation to the States for
loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the goods and services
tax for a period of five years.
19\. Transitional provisions- Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any
provision of any law relating to tax on goods or services or on both in force
in any State immediately before the commencement of this Act, which is
inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution as amended by this Act
shall continue to be in force until  Page 76 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT amended or repealed by a
competent Legislature or other competent authority or until expiration of one
year from such commencement, whichever is earlier.
26\. At this stage, it is also relevant to notice that in the Constitution
(One Hundred and Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, 2014, Clause 18 contain a
provision for arrangement for assignment of additional tax on supply of goods
to States for two years or such other period recommended by Council, which was
to the following effect:"
18\. Arrangement for assignment of additional tax on supply of goods to States
for two years or such other period recommended by Council (1) An additional
tax on supply of goods, not exceeding one per cent. in the course of inter-
State trade or commerce shall, notwithstanding anything contained in clause
(1) of article 269A, be levied and collected by the Government of India for a
period of two years or such other period as the Goods and Services Tax Council
may recommend, and such tax shall be assigned to the States in the manner
provided in clause (2).
(2) The net proceeds of additional tax on supply of goods in any financial
year, except the proceeds attributable to the Union territories, shall not
form part of the Consolidated Fund of India and be deemed to have been
assigned to the States from where the supply originates.
(3) The Government of India may, where it considers necessary in the public
interest, exempt such goods from the levy of tax under clause (1).
(4) Parliament may, by law, formulate the principles for determining the place
of origin from where supply of goods take place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce."
27\. Clause 19 contain compensation to States for loss of revenue on account
of introduction of goods and services tax. Clause 19 of the Bill is as
follows:"
19\. Compensation to States for loss of revenue on account of introduction of
goods and services tax- Parliament may, by law, on the recommendation of the
Page 77 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT Goods and Services Tax Council, provide for compensation to the
States for loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the goods
and services tax for such period which may extend to five years."
28\. It is, however, to be noticed that Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty
Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 was passed but Clause 18 of the Bill was not
incorporated and Clause 19 found place as Section 18 of the Constitution (One
Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016. After the aforesaid Constitution
Amendment, Parliament enacted Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (Act
No.12 of 2017 dated 12.04.2017) to make a provision for levy and collection of
tax on intra State supply of goods or services or both by the Central
Government and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. On the
same day, another enactment namely 'The Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act,
2017' (Act No. 13 of 2017 dated 12.04.2017) was enacted to make a provision
for levy and collection of tax on inter-State supply of goods or services or
both by the Central Government and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto. Another enactment namely 'The Union Territory Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017' (Act No. 14 of 2017) was passed on the same day to
make a provision for levy and collection of tax on intra-State supply of goods
or services or both by the Union territories and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto. The Fourth Parliamentary enactment, which is
subject matter of challenge in the present case was also enacted on the same
day, i.e. 12.04.2017, namely 'The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to
States) Act, 2017' (Act NO. 15 of 2017) to provide for compensation to the
States for the loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the
goods and services tax in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution (One
Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016\. As the Preamble indicate
(Compensation to States) Act, 2017 was enacted in pursuance of the provisions
of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016.
79 The observations made by the Supreme Court as contained in para 55 are
important. Those read as under:

CAV JUDGMENT
> "55. The expression used in Article 246A is "power to make laws with respect

> Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 was passed to subsume various taxes,
> surcharges and cesses into one tax but the constitutional provision does not
> indicate that henceforth no surcharge or cess shall be levied."
80\. The issue can also be looked into from a different angle. Article 246(A)
of the Constitution of India has been inserted in the Constitution of India to
provide for integrated power to the Union of India and the States to make a
common law to levy tax on the "Goods and Services". Article 246A is not akin
to the "concurrent list" enumerated in List III in Schedule VII of the
Constitution of India which empowers, either the Union or State, to make laws
with respect to levy of tax on either the goods or services. The Parliament in
its wisdom did not incorporate power to make laws with respect to the "Goods
and Services Tax" in the "Concurrent list" enumerated in List III in Schedule
VII of the Constitution of India but inserted a new Article 246A in the
Constitution of India to confer an integrated power, to both the Union and the
State, which is to be exercised simultaneously by both, to make a common law
to levy tax on the "Goods and Services". The purpose of this constitutional
amendment was perhaps to have a uniform "Goods and Services Tax" law
throughout the country.
81\. It prima facie appears that the power conferred by Article 246A of the
Constitution of India is to be exercised by both, the  Page 79 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
Union and the States concurrently to ensure uniform "Goods and Services Tax"
law all over the country. The Union of India or States cannot separately
exercise power given by Article 246A of the Constitution of India independent
of each other unlike the power given by the "Concurrent list" enumerated in
the List III in the Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.
82\. Further, Article 245A in the Constitution of India empowers to make a
integrated tax law with respect to levy of tax on either "Goods" or
"Services".
83\. Once again, we may look into the observations made by the Supreme Court
in Mohit Mineral Pvt. Ltd (supra) as contained in para-55. The same reads
thus;
> "55. The expression used in Article 246A is "power to make laws with respect
> to goods and service tax". The power to make law, thus, is not general power
> related to a general entry rather it specifically relates to goods and

> Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 was passed to subsume various taxes,
> surcharges and cesses into one tax but the constitutional provision does not
> indicate that henceforth no surcharge or cess shall be levied."
84\. The objective of the One Hundred and first amendment to the Constitution
of India vide the Constitution (One Hundred And Firsts Amendment) Act, 2016
was to bring into force a uniform law for levy of tax on "Goods and Services"
and not separate laws with respect to either Goods and Services.
85\. The statement of objects and reasons as provided in the  Page 80 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
Bill introduced in Loksabha on 18th December, 2014 clearly stated that the
Constitution is proposed to be amended to introduce the goods and services tax
for conferring concurrent taxing powers on the Union as well as the States
including the Union territory with Legislature to make laws for levying goods
and services tax on every transaction of supply of goods or services or both.
It further provided that it seeks to amend the Constitution to subsume the
State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax.
86\. It is an established principle of interpretation of statues to look into
the mischief which was intended to be remedied by enactment of the statute.
87\. It has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of U.P.Bhoodan Yagna
Samiti, U.P. Vs. Braj Kishore and Ors. reported in AIR 1988 SC 2239 that one
has to look to the intention of the Legislature, one has to look to the
circumstances under which the law was enacted, the Preamble of the law, the
mischief which was intended to be remedied by the enactment of the statute.
88\. The Entry 54 in List II in Schedule VII of the Constitution of India was
amended to extinguish the power of states to levy taxes on sale or purchase of
goods except taxes on the sale of petroleum products and alcoholic liquor for
human consumption. Therefore, the power to amend any law with respect to levy
of tax on the sale or purchase of goods such as "Gujarat VAT Act" could be
said to have been abolished with the aforesaid amendment in the Entry 54 in
List II in Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.

89\. Having given our earnest consideration to all the relevant aspects of the
matter, we have reached to the conclusion that Article 246A of the
Constitution of India does not save Section 84A of the VAT Act from being
declared invalid or ultra vires. As noted above, Article 246A of the
Constitution was inserted by the 101st Constitution Amendment Act with the
sole or rather the precise object of subsuming multiple indirect taxes and to
confer concurrent power to the Parliament and State Legislature to impose
"Goods & Services Tax" in accordance with the recommendations of the Goods &
Services Tax Council statute under Article 279A of the Constitution of India.
The very object of such large scale reform was to replace number of indirect
taxes being levied by the Union and the State Governments and to remove the
cascading effect of taxes and provide for a common national market for goods
and services. This is apparent from the statement of objects and reasons
referred to by the Supreme Court in Mohit Mineral Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
90\. Further Section 18 to the Constitution Amendment Act provides for
compensation to the States for the loss of revenue arising on account of the
implementation of the goods and services tax for a period of 5 years. Thus the
entire scheme of the Constitution Amendment Act recognizes imposition of only
"goods and services tax" under Article 246A of the Constitution of India. The
phrase the "goods and services tax" is defined under Article 366(29A) to mean
any tax on supply of goods or service or both except taxes on the supply of
alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Such "supply" cannot be fragmented
into different components by the State legislature and assume power to impose
independent tax on the sale of goods without  Page 82 of 152 Downloaded on :
Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT reference to the
Goods and Services Tax Council. Such interpretation would be contrary to the
entire scheme as well as the object and purpose of the Constitution Amendment
Act. In fact the provision providing for compensation to the States for the
loss of revenue due to the goods and services tax would also be irrelevant if
the State legislatures are independently empowered to enact sales tax/value
added tax legislations by taking recourse to Article 246A of the Constitution
of India.
91\. In fact if the State legislature has the power to enact the value added
tax laws under Article 246A of the Constitution of India as argued on behalf
of the State, then Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution which was retained to the extent of six products which are
outside the GST regime will be rendered redundant. The very fact that Entry 54
of List II of the Seventh Schedule was retained in so far as the six products
are concerned indicates that the sales tax/value added tax enactment is not
permissible under Article 246A of the Constitution of India. The vociferous
argument of the State that Article 246A of the Constitution can support the
enactment of provision under the Vat Act falls flat in the face of the
existence of Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution
of India which survived the 101 st Constitution Amendment Act.
92\. We may clarify that in Mohit Mineral Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the challenge was
to the imposition of the compensation cess under the Goods & Services Tax
(Compensation to States) Act, 2017 on the ground of lack legislative
competence. The Union defended such levy by relying upon Article 246A of the

and its validity was upheld by the Supreme Court. Mr. Soparkar invited our

Opac Engineering Pvt. Ltd. vs. The State Tax Officer (Works Contract) & Ors.,
rendered in WP (C) No.32439 of 2019, decided on 6th Day of December, 2019/
15th Agrahayana, 1941\. In the case before the Kerala High Court, the legality
and validity of the notices and assessment orders issued to the petitioners in
connection with the assessment under the Kerala Value Added Tax Act (for short
"the KVAT Act") for the A.Y. 2010-11 and 2011-12 was made a subject matter of
challenge. The main plank of challenge to the impugned notices and orders was
on the ground that the authorities concerned had no jurisdiction since the
amendments introduced to Section 25(1) of the KVAT Act through the Kerala
Finance Acts of 2017 and 2018 notified through Gazette Notifications dated
19.06.2017 and 31.03.2018 respectively did not contemplate a retrospective
operation of the amended provisions. A learned Single Judge of the Kerala High
Court formulated the following questions of law for the purpose of deciding
the matter.
> "(a) Whether under the provisions of Section 25(1) of the KVAT Act, as
> amended by the Kerala Finance Act, 2017, and before the repeal of the KVAT

94\. The discussion with respect to the issues Nos. c and d respectively
assumes importance and significance. We quote the findings recorded by the
Kerala High Court.
> " Although detailed arguments have been advanced before me on both these

> (c) in these cases.
This is because issue (d) had come up for consideration before a learned
single judge in a batch of cases where the validity of Section 174 of the
State GST Act had been called in question. Rejecting the contentions of the
assessees in those cases, the court in Sheen Golden Jewels (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. State Tax Officer & Ors. - [2019 (27) KTR 119 (Ker)] found that the mere
repeal of the KVAT Act with effect from 22.06.2017 did not have the effect of
making the KVAT inapplicable in respect of those actions that were expressly
saved by the provisions of Section 174 of the State GST Act. The Court found
that the State legislature retained its legislative power to enact the savings
clause under Section 174 of the State GST Act and that the only difference in
the nature of that power was that, while prior to the introduction of GST
through the CAA the State Legislatures enjoyed exclusivity in the mater of
legislation on the subject of taxes on sale or purchase of goods, after the
CAA, they had simultaneous legislative power, with the Parliament, to
legislate in respect of taxes on supply (which included sale) of goods or
services or both. The challenge to the notices and orders issued/passed by the
revenue authorities was rejected on the finding that the actions of the
revenue authorities, in issuing such notices and passing such orders, were
saved by the provisions of Section 174 of the State GST Act, the validity of
which  Page 87 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT was also upheld.
18\. I am given to understand that an intra-court appeal against the aforesaid
judgment of the learned Single Judge is pending consideration before a
Division Bench of this Court. At any rate, the said judgment, which dealt with
actions taken by the revenue authorities before the amendments brought in to
the KVAT Act through the Kerala Finance Act, 2018, did not have to consider
the issue of legislative competence of the State Legislature to amend the KVAT
Act, after the CAA, 2016, and the repeal of the KVAT Act pursuant thereto, on
22.06.2017. It is to a consideration of the said issue that I now turn.
19\. As already noticed above, the amendments effected to Section 25 (1) of
the KVAT Act, through the Kerala Finance Act 2017, were before the repeal of
the KVAT Act with effect from 22.06.2017. The provision as it stood then, and
in particular the third proviso thereto, authorised the re-opening of past
assessments till 31.03.2018. The amendment effected through the Kerala Finance
Act, 2018, with effect from 01.04.2018, enlarged the period for re-opening
past assessments from 31.03.2018 to 31.03.2019. Under ordinary circumstances,
and based on my findings above as regards the effect of the amendments brought
into the third proviso to Section 25 (1) by the Kerala Finance Act, 2017, the
legislative measures should have sufficed to justify a re- opening of past
assessments up to 31.03.2019, notwithstanding that the amendment itself was
effective only from 01.04.2018. However, the intervention of the CAA 2016, and
the consequent repeal of the KVAT Act with effect from 22.06.2017, has a
bearing on the legality of the 2018 amendment. A distinction does exist
between the saving of rights, privileges, immunities and liabilities under a
repealed enactment, through a savings clause inserted in the new enactment
traceable to the same legislative power, and an amendment brought in to a
repealed enactment after the legislative power justifying both actions, prior
to the CAA 2016, could have been traced to Article 246 of our Constitution,
read with the relevant entry in the VIIth Schedule thereto, the position
changed when there was a fundamental shift in the nature of the tax levy and a
fresh conferment  Page 88 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT of legislative power to legislate in respect of
the new levy. After the CAA 2016, the State Legislatures stood denuded of
their power to legislate in respect of taxes on sale or purchase of goods,
that was covered under Entry 54 of List II of the VII th Schedule to the
Constitution, and they were instead conferred with legislative powers, to be
exercised simultaneously with the Parliament, in respect of taxes on supply of
goods or services or both. While the new legislative power could justify the
inclusion of a savings clause in the new legislation enacted in respect of the
new levy of tax, to save accrued rights, privileges, immunities etc. under the
erstwhile enactment, the deletion of Entry 54 of List II automatically denuded
the State Legislatures of the power to further legislate on the subject of
taxes on sale or purchase of goods, except to the limited extent retained
under the Constitution. The power to amend a statute being a facet of the
legislative power itself, the State legislature could not have exercised a
power to amend the KVAT Act, save to the extent permitted, when it did not
retain any residual right to further legislate on the subject of taxes on sale
or purchase of goods.
20\. There is yet another aspect of the matter. It is trite that when a Court
judges the Constitutionality of a legislative enactment it should try to
sustain the validity of the enactment to the extent possible and it should
strike down the law only when it is impossible to sustain it State of Bihar v.
Bihar Distilery - [JT (1996) 10 SC 854]. At the same time, the Court must
proceed to determine the intention of the Parliament, not only from the
language used in the statute but also from surrounding circumstances and an
understanding of the mischief that was sought to be remedied by the statute.
When one applies the said test to the events that took place after the CAA,
2016, it cannot but be noticed that the very purpose of the CAA was to bring
about a change in the system of indirect taxation in our country through the
introduction of a Goods and Service Tax, and the phasing out of the multitude
of indirect tax levies, including value added taxes, that were levied and
collected by the Centre and the States. Section 19 of the CAA 2016, which is
the sunset clause in the said enactment, envisaged the  Page 89 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
continuation of the erstwhile system of taxation for a period of one year from
the date of enactment of the CAA or till such time as the State legislatures
amended or repealed their respective VAT legislations, whichever was earlier.
When the State legislature repealed the KVAT Act, while simultaneously
bringing into force the new State GST Act, with a savings clause of limited
operation, it effectively acknowledged the absence of any power to legislate
thereafter on the subject of tax on sale or purchase of goods, except in
respect of the limited commodities for which the said power was retained under
the Constitution. In respect of all other commodities, the legislative power
of the State was only in respect of taxes on the supply of goods or services
or both, a power that had to be exercised simultaneously with the Parliament
and not unilaterally or exclusively. Thus, at the time of repeal of the KVAT
Act, and simultaneous enactment of the State GST Act with a savings clause
therein, the savings clause operated only to save rights, privileges,
immunities, action taken etc under the erstwhile enactment as it stood at the
time of its repeal, which included the amendments brought in through the
Kerala Finance Act, 2017. There could not have been any further legislative
exercise by the State legislature in relation to the repealed KVAT Act.
21\. I therefore find that issue (c) has to be answered in the negative and in
favour of the writ petitioners. The amendments to Section 25 of the KVAT Act,
through the Kerala Finance Act, 2018 are declared illegal and unconstitutional
in as much as they were beyond the legislative competence of the State
Legislature. In the result, these writ petitions are disposed by declaring
that,
(i) the assessments in respect of which the period of limitation for re-
opening under Section 25 of the KVAT Act was to expire by 31.03.2017 can be
re-opened up to 31.03.2018 by virtue of the amendment to the third proviso to
Section 25 (1) vide Kerala Finance Act, 2017.
(ii) the assessments in respect of which the period of limitation for re-
opening under Section 25 of the KVAT Act was to expire by 31.03.2018 cannot be
re-opened up  Page 90 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT to 31.03.2019 or thereafter, by relying on the
amendments introduced through the Kerala Finance Act, 2018 since the State
Legislature did not have the power to amend the KVAT Act after the CAA 2016,
and the repeal of the KVAT Act pursuant thereto, on 22.06.2017.
(iii) The legality of the orders/notices impugned in these writ petitions
shall stand determined by the declarations in (i) and (ii) above. "
95\. The line of reasoning adopted by the Kerala High Court in the aforesaid
decision fortifies our view that the State Legislature could not have amended
the State VAT Act by enacting Section 84A which is sought to be protected by
virtue of Article 246A of t he Constitution.
96\. The dictum as laid by the Kerala High Court may be summarized as under:
> "Amendments made prior to introduction of GST The Legislature can take away
> a right/immunity by retrospective amendment. However, Section 25(1) which
> was made effective only from April 1, 2017, has a prospective operation.

97\. Mr. Kamal Trivedi, the learned Advocate General placed strong reliance on
the decision of the Kerala High Court in the case of Sheen Golden Jewels
(India) Pvt. Ltd vs. State Tax Officer, 2019 SCC Online Ker. 973. Strong
reliance has been placed on the following observations;
Page 92 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
"133.Article 246 of the Constitution deals with the distribution of
legislative powers. Under Clause (1) of that Article, Parliament has the
exclusive power to make laws on any of the matters enumerated in List I (Union
List) in the Seventh Schedule. Under Clause (2) both Parliament and the State
Legislature have concurrent powers to make laws on any matter enumerated in
List III (the Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule. But the State
Legislature's power to legislate over the matters in the Concurrent List is
subject to Parliament's power under the Union List. Then, of course, subject
to Parliament's powers under List I and List III, the State Legislature has
the exclusive power to make laws on any matter enumerated in List II (State
List). Besides, under Article 245(4) of the Constitution, Parliament has the
power on any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a
State.
134\. The CA Act examined, we can notice that from 16.09.2016, Article 246
stood amended and modified in its operation; Article 246A was introduced.
Section 2 of the CA Act signifies a drastic constitutional shift in the
division of legislative powers: instead of division, it fosters amalgamation.
Article 246A has no schedules.
135\. And the scheme of the CA Act further examined, Entry 54 of List II
stands substituted. So comes the assertion from the petitioners that Entry 54
abrogated (it is not, though), the States have been denuded of the power of
taxation from 16.9.2016 on the items that stand deleted. For them, the interim
or temporary continuation is only up to 16.09.2017, as per Section19 of the CA
Act. They also argue that if the State wants to sustain "taxes under Entry 54,
then there is no necessity to abrogate the erstwhile Entry 54 on 16.09.2016.
Read otherwise, Section 19 would be rendered otiose, meaningless, and would
have no significant purpose at all.
136\. Unfortunately, the whole argument is sought to be erected on a slippery
slope. There is no denudation of legislative power, no obliteration of Entry
54 of List II. An entry's abrogation, as it were, would not ipso facto lead to
the legislative denudation. I will elaborate on that, later.
Page 93 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
141\. Now, let us examine both Section 19 of the CA Act and Section 174 of the
KSGST Act. Section 19 mandates that any inconsistent law relating to tax on
goods and services in force in any State before 16.09.2016 (the commencement
of the CA Act) shall continue to be in force "until amended or repealed by a
competent Legislature or other competent authority". So the States were,
first, required to amend the inconsistent laws to bring them in harmony with
the CA Act. Otherwise, the States must repeal them. And they were given one
year for achieving this. If the States do neither, those inconsistent acts
stand repealed.
142\. Here, the States acted; they amended a few inconsistent Acts. They also
repealed a few more. As with the KVAT Act, the repeal, if it were, has not
resulted in its abrogation or annihilation. So the operation of the so- called
sunset clause (as provided in Section 19) has not denuded the State's power to
enforce the KVAT Act in its amended form. The Act remained, with its remit
reduced, though. Thus goes out of reckoning the petitioners' another
assertion: that with the repeal of the enactments, the procedural mechanism
has disappeared. It has not. The prospectivity of the amendment undisputed,
what remains to be examined is the State's power to save what had happened
before the CA Act came into force or, more precisely, until one year after
that Act came into force. Indeed, the CA Act allowed the State Acts in the
same legislative field to coexist for one year: the window period.
180\. The petitioners argue that the CA Act has disrupted the federal
demarcations; the State's legislative fields under Entry 54 of the Second
Schedule have been truncated. Thus, the State has no longer the power to
legislate on the files that have been taken away from it. Have the State's
legislative power on the items once available for it under the Entry 52 taken
away? We will see.
181 First, the State's legislative powers have not been taken away; they have
been, on the contrary, constitutionally permitted to be shared with the Union
Page 94 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT Government. What is gone is the State's exclusivity. To the
legislative fields of exclusivity and concurrency, what has been added is the
simultaneity-novel as it may sound.
182\. To encapsulate, I may observe that all the petitioners have advanced one
common argument: the State has been denuded of its legislative power to enact
Section 174 of the Kerala State Goods and Services Act, 2017\. The obvious
prop for this assertion comes from the 101st Constitutional Amendment-that is,
the attenuated or modified Entry 54 of the List II, the State List.
183\. All the petitioners contend that the KSGST Act came into being because
of the Constitutional Amendment. And that very Constitutional Amendment has
put paid to many other enactments-for example, the Kerala Value Added Tax Act,
2003. So with the Entry 54 of List II unavailable for the State to incorporate
Section 174 of the KSGST Act, the whole saving mechanism vis-à-vis
transactions before 16.09.2017 crumbles.
184\. I am afraid it is a fallacy on the petitioners' part to contend that the
State lacks the legislative power to enact Section 174 of the KSGST Act.
Article 246A is the special provision (if it can be called a provision) on the
Goods and Services Tax. It empowers, as rightly contended by the learned
Senior Counsel Shri Venkataraman, both the Union and the State, for the first
time, to have simultaneous-not concurrent- powers to legislate on certain
items. Indeed, concurrency yields to the doctrine of repugnancy, but
simultaneous legislative power does not. That is, both the legislatures, say
one from the Union and the other from the State, coexist- operate in the same
sphere, subject to other constitutional safeguards.
185\. In Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd., the Supreme Court has held that the
power to legislate does not flow from a single Article of the Constitution. To
articulate this assertion and to elaborate on it, Bimolangshu Roy observes
that besides the declaration in Article 246, there are various other Articles
in the Constitution which confer authority on the Parliament or on a State
legislature to legislate, under various circumstances.
Page 95 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
186\. Indeed the State legislatures are assigned only specified fields of
legislation, the residuary legislative powers lying with the Parliament. But
taxing entries are distinct from the general entries. So comes a federal
constitutional experiment in the fiscal field: the 101st Constitutional
Amendment."
98\. It has been vehemently argued by Mr. Trivedi by placing reliance on the
aforesaid observations of the Kerala High Court that the entries to the
legislative list are not the only source of the legislative power but are
merely topics or fields of legislation and that the competence to legislate
flows from the Articles in Part-XI of the Constitution of India. It is sought
to be argued by the learned Advocate General that the amendments in such
entries like the amendment in Entry 54 of List II in the present case would
not make any difference to the legislative competence of the State Legislature
to make any laws, which otherwise flows from the substantive provisions under
the Constitution. To fortify such submission, reliance has been placed on a
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs.
State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 45. It has been argued by Mr. Trivedi that by
enacting Section 84A in the VAT Act, the State Legislature has not proposed to
levy any fresh tax, but merely allowed the department to enlarge the period of
limitation under the provisions of Section 75 of the VAT Act, if permissible,
so as to collect the legitimate tax already levied but could not be collected
in view of the pendency of litigation before the Supreme Court.
99\. We are afraid we are not in a position to agree with the stance of the
State. In Sheen Golden Jewels (India) Ltd. (supra),  Page 96 of 152 Downloaded
on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the challenge
was to Section 174 of the Kerala Goods & Services Tax Act, 2013 which saved
the levy, assessment and recovery of transactions under the pre-GST enactments
on the ground that the same was beyond the legislative competence of the State
Legislatures after the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act. In such context, it
was held that the State Legislature had the competence to enact a savings
clause in respect of the past transactions. The High Court rejected the
contention that even the existing liabilities under the pre-GST enactments
would stand obliterated by Section 19 of the 101st Constitutional Amendment
Act. In the case on hand, the issue is altogether different and of wide
import. In the case on hand, the issue is whether the State Legislature can
create fresh liabilities by enactment of Section 84A of the VAT Act after the
101st Constitutional Amendment Act. The dictum as laid down in Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) would also not help the State. In the said case,
the Supreme Court observed that various entries in the three lists in the
seventh schedule of the Constitution are not "powers" of legislation but
"fields" of legislation and that the power to legislate is given by Article
246 and other Articles of the Constitution. In the case on hand, the State
seeks to uphold the validity of Section 84A of the VAT Act by placing reliance
upon Article 246A of the Constitution and not on the list of seventh schedule
to the Constitution of India.
100\. In M/s. Hoechst Pharmaceuticals (supra), the Supreme Court held as
under:
> "The word "Notwithstanding anything contained in Clauses (2) and (3), in
> Article 246(1) and the words "subject to Cls. (1) and (2)" in Art. 246(3)
> lay down the principle of Federal  Page 97 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
> 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Supremacy viz. that in case
> of inevitable conflict between Union and State powers, the Union power as
> enumerated in List I shall prevail over the State power as enumerated in
> Lists II and III, and in case of overlapping between Lists II and III, the
> former shall prevail. But the principle of Federal Supremacy laid down in
> Article 246 of the Constitution cannot be resorted to unless there is an
> "irreconciliable" conflict between the Entries in the Union and State Lists.
> In the case of a seeming conflict between the Entries in the two Lists, the
> Entries should be read together without giving a narrow and restricted sense
> to either of them. Secondly, an attempt should be made to see whether the
> two entries cannot be reconciled so as to avoid a conflict of jurisdiction.
> It should be considered whether a fair reconciliation can be achieved by
> giving to the language of the Union Legislative List a meaning which, if
> less wide than it might in another context bear, is yet one that can
> properly be given to it and equally giving to the language of the State
> Legislative List a meaning which it can properly bear. The nonobstante
> clause in Article 246(1) must operate only if such reconciliation should
> prove impossible. Thirdly, no question of conflict between the two Lists
> will arise if the impugned legislation, by the application of the doctrine
> of 'pith and substance' appears to fall exclusively under one List, and the
> encroachment upon another list is only incidental."
101\. From the aforesaid decision, which is sought to be relied upon by the
State, the principle that flow are these:
> [1] First, the words "notwithstanding anything contained" in clauses (1) and
> (2) of Article 246 and the words "subject to" used in clauses (2) and (3) of
> Article 246 show the supremacy of Parliament namely when there is any
> conflict between the Union and the State power, the Union power enumerated
> in List I shall prevail over the State power mentioned in Lists II and III
> and in case of overlapping between Lists II and III, the former shall
> prevail.
> [2] Secondly, however, before the Court decides the supremacy of Parliament,
> there should be an effort by  Page 98 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
> 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the Court to reconcile the
> conflict between the entries in the Union and the State Lists. The non-
> obstante clause in Article 246(1) and (2) operates only when such
> reconciliation between the two entries is not possible.
> [3] Thirdly, where the competence of State Legislature is challenged, the
> Court should not proceed with the supremacy of Parliament by employing
> expressions 'notwithstanding' and 'subject to' and the Court should consider
> the scope of the entries under which the legislation has been enacted.
> [4] Fourthly, there would be no conflict between the two lists if on the
> application of doctrine of pith and substance, the legislation falls
> exclusively in one List and the tresspass is only incidental and [5] Fifthly
> the general entry in one list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is
> not to be interpreted as to obliterate the subject-matter of a specific
> entry in other list.
102\. While laying down the aforesaid principles of law, the Supreme Court
made a statement that the entries in the lists are themselves not powers of
legislation, but fields of legislation. This does not necessarily imply that
the entries are to be ignored. It must receive at the most a liberal
construction by a broad & generous spirit & not in a narrow pedantic sense.

104\. In the case of State of Bombay vs. R.M.B. Chamarbaugwalia and others
reported in AIR 1956 Bom 1, Chagla, C.J. sitting with Justice Dixit observed
thus:
> "The first question that arises for our consideration is with regard to the
> legislative competence of the State Legislature to enact this Act. In our
> opinion, the correct principle which should be applied in order to ascertain
> whether the State Legislature is competent to pass an impugned piece of

> Seventh Schedule of the Constitution in Order to determine whether the
> Legislature has legislated upon a topic within its competence. If it has
> legislated upon a topic not within its competence, than the legislation is
> clearly ' ultra vires ' and no further question arises.
105\. The aforenoted Division Bench decision of the Bombay High Court was
looked into by a Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court reported in AIR 1957
SC 699. S.R. Das, J., speaking for the Bench, observed thus:
> "The principal question canvassed before us relates to the validity or
> otherwise of the impugned Act. The Court of Appeal has rightly pointed out
> that when the validity of an Act is called in question, the first thing for

107\. In the case of Gullapalli Nageswara Rao and others vs. A.P. State Road
Transport Corporation reported in AIR 1959 SC 308, a Bench of five Judges,
speaking through S.R. Das, C.J.I., observed as under:
> "As was said by Duff J., in AttorneyGeneral for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insure
> (1924 A. C.328 at p. 337), 'Where the law making authority is of a limited
> or qualifled character it may be necessary to examine with some strictness
> the substance of the legislation for the purpose of determining what is that

> We have quoted the observations in extenso as they neatly summarise the law
> on the subject. The legal position may be briefly stated thus : The
> Legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. Its
> legislative field may be circumscribed by specific legislative entries or
> limited by Fundamental Rights created by the Constitution. The Legislature
> cannot over-step the field of its competency, directly or indirectly. The
> Court will scrutinize the law to  Page 101 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
> 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT ascertain whether the
> Legislature by device purports to make a law which, though in form appears
> to be within its sphere, in effect and substance, reaches beyond it. If, in
> fact, it has power to make the law, its motives in making the law are
> irrelevant."
108\. There need not be any debate on the statement of law that the entries in
the lists are themselves not power of legislation, but fields of legislation.
It is trite that India being a Union of State both the Parliament and the
State Legislature can frame laws having regard to their respective legislative
competence enumerated in the three Lists contained in the Seventh Schedule of
the Constitution of India. The Parliament has exclusive power to make laws
with respect of any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh
Schedule. Similarly, State Legislatures have exclusive power to make laws in
respect of any of the matters enumerated in List II. Parliament and State
Legislatures both have legislative power to make laws with respect to any
matter enumerated in List III, the Concurrent List. The various entries in the
three Lists are fields of legislation. They are designed to define and delimit
the respective areas of legislative competence of the Union and State
Legislatures.
109\. We once again reiterate the tests prescribed by the Supreme Court in the
case of Chamarbaugwalia (supra) for the purpose of testing the competence of
enactment passed by the legislature of a State. First, the Court should
examine whether the Act is a law with respect to a topic assigned to the
particular legislature which enacted it. Thereafter, the Court should consider
whether in the case of an Act passed by the legislature of a State, its
operation extends beyond the  Page 102 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT boundaries of the State. If
these two tests are satisfied, then the Court should in the lists consider or
rather ascertain if there is anything in any other part of the Constitution
which places any fetter on the legislative powers of such legislature. The
mandate of the Supreme Court is very clear that the impugned law should pass
of the above referred three tests.
110\. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, we find it difficult to
uphold the contention of Mr. Trivedi that Article 54 in Lists II of the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution as amended should be ignored as the State
Legislature has been conferred with the power to enact a provision like
Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act by virtue of Article 246A of the
Constitution.
111\. Mr. Soparkar brought to our notice that the argument canvassed on behalf
of the State that the impugned proceedings are one relating to the recovery
related to one of the six products covered under Entry 54 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule is something contrary to the record of the case. It has been
pointed out to us that the goods manufactured by the writ applicant are
petrochemicals which are indisputably not covered by Entry 54 of List II of
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It has been argued that if
the revision initiated by the impugned notice is concluded by disallowance of
the input tax credit, then the same will result in recovery of tax on such
petrochemicals. The fact that the input tax credit proposed to be disallowed
is relating to the purchases of natural gas is of no significance. Tax on
natural gas has been fully paid as pointed out by Mr. Soparkar. The tax demand
on the writ applicants proposed to  Page 103 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT be made by disallowance of the
input tax credit is on the sales made by the writ applicants which are
indisputably of goods not covered under Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India.
EQUITY, MORALITY AND FAIRNESS:
112\. Mr. Trivedi, the learned Advocate General also tried to defend Section
84A of the VAT Act on the ground that the tax dues which were morally due to
the State are sought to be recovered. In other words, the argument is that the
State had no other option but to enact Section 84A in the VAT Act. It is
sought to be argued that the State was remediless in a situation where there
was judgment of this High Court operating in favour of the dealer at the time
of assessment which was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court. Such
stance of the State is not tenable in law in view of two decisions of the
Supreme Court. In the case of Asst. Commissioner, Commercial Tax vs. LIS
(Registered), (2018) 15 SCC 283. it has been observed in Para-12 as under;
> "12. Time and again, it has been emphasized that a taxing statute cannot be
> made applicable to a citizen by unnatural or unreasonable extensions
> thereof. A recent view of this Court in this regard is available in 'Shabina

31\. The impugned judgment in the present case has referred to Ellis C. Reid's
case but has not extracted the real ratio contained therein. It then goes on
to say that this is a case of short-levy which has been noticed during the
lifetime of the deceased and then goes on to state that equally therefore,
legal representatives of a manufacturer who had paid excess duty would not by
the self-same reasoning be able to claim such excess amount paid by the
deceased. Neither of these reasons are reasons which refer to any provision of
law.
Apart from this, the High Court went into morality and said that the moral
principle of unlawful enrichment would also apply and since the law will not
permit this, the Act needs to be interpreted accordingly. We wholly disapprove
of the approach of the High Court. It flies in the case of first 2 AIR 1931
Bombay 333 principle when it comes to taxing statutes. It is therefore,
necessary to reiterate the law as it stands. In Partington v. A.G., (1869) LR
4 HL 100 at 122, Lord Cairns stated :
"If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must
be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On
the other hand, if the Crown seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the
subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently
within the spirit of law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other
words, if there be admissible in any statute, what is called an equitable,
construction, certainly, such a construction is not admissible in a taxing
statute where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute."
32\. In Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64 at 71, Rowlatt J. laid
down :
"In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.
There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is
no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.
One can only look fairly at the language used."
33\. This Court has, in a plethora of judgments, referred to the aforesaid
principles. Suffice it to quote from one of such judgments of this Court in
Commissioner of Sales  Page 105 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST
2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Tax, Uttar Pradesh v. Modi Surgar Mills,
1961 (2) SCR 189 at 198 :-
"In interpreting a taxing statute,equitable considerations are entirely out of
place. Nor can taxing statutes be interpreted on any presumptions or
assumptions. The Court must look squarely at the words of the statute and
interpret them. It must interpret a taxing statute in the light of what is
clearly expressed; it cannot imply anything which is not expressed; it cannot
import provisions in the statute so as to supply any assumed deficiency."
113\. In the case of Nestle India Ltd vs. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial
Tax, (2016) 89 VST 56 (Guj.). It has been observed by M.R. Shah (as His
Lordship then was) in Para 8.13 as under;
> "8.13 Now, so far as the decisions, upon which the learned AGP has relied,
> which are referred to herein above in support of his submission that

114\. It is well known that motive or intention for making an Act or issuing
an ordinance is not justifiable before a court of law. Whenever the
expressions colourable exercise of power or fraud on Constitution are used in
connection with any enactment, it only means that the particular legislature
had no legislative competence although it purports to have exercised that
power. Reference in this connection may be made to the cases of K.C.Gajapati
Narayan Deo v. State of Orissa (AIR 1953 SC 375), Bhairabendra Narayan Bhup v.
State of Assam (AIR 1956 SC 503), Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v. Andhra Pradesh

v. Ajit Mills Ltd. (AIR 1977 SC 2279). In the case of K.C.Gajapati Narayan Deo
(AIR 1953 SC 375), it was observed (at p. 379):
> "It may be made clear at the outset that the doctrine of colourable
> legislation does not involve any question of 'bona fides' or 'mala fides' on
> the part of the legislature. The whole doctrine resolves itself into the
> question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular
> law. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the motives
> which impelled it to act are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if the
> legislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise at
> all..... if the Constitution of a State distributes the legislative powers

115\. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Taxes and others vs.
LIS (Registered) reported in (2018) 15 SCC 283, wherein the Supreme Court has
observed that in interpreting a taxing statute, the equitable considerations
are entirely out of place. It has been observed in so many words that reasons
of morality and fairness can have no application to bring a citizen who is not
within the four corners of the taxing statute within its fold so as to make
him liable to payment of tax. We quote the relevant observations:

"12. Time and again, it has been emphasized that a taxing statute cannot be

116\. We are at one with Mr. Soparkar that the State- respondents could have
definitely issued notice for revision under Section 75 of the VAT Act within
the stipulated period of limitation to keep the matter alive. To illustrate,
if the time limit for passing of revisional order was to expire and the issue
was still pending before the Supreme Court, then the respondents could have
passed an order in favour of the dealer and, thereafter, carried the matter
before the Tribunal/High Court by filing the revision application/appeal.
IS THE VAT AMENDMENT ACT, 2018 A VALIDATING ACT?
117\. Mr. Trivedi made a gallant effort to convince us to accept the

According to Mr. Trivedi, the validation exercise may be undertaken by a
Competent Legislature by adopting any of the following methods.
(a) By removing the obstacle of illegality or invalidity, retrospectively, or,
(b) By providing for jurisdiction retrospectively, where jurisdiction had not
been properly invested before, or, (c ) By re-enacting retrospectively, a
valid and legal taxing provision and then by fiction, making the tax already
collected to stand under the re-enacted law, or
(d) By giving its own meaning and interpretation of the law under which tax
was collected and by legislation fiat, making the new meaning binding upon the
Courts.
116\. In the aforesaid context, Mr. Trivedi seeks to rely on a decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Shri Prithvi  Page 111 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT Cotton Mills Ltd vs.
Broach Borough Municipality, 1969 (2) SCC 283, more particularly, the
observations made in Para- 4, which reads thus;
> "4. ....Ordinarily, a court holds a tax to be invalidly imposed because the
> power to tax is wanting or the statute or the rules or both are invalid or
> do not sufficiently create the jurisdiction. Validation of a tax so declared
> illegal may be done only if the grounds of illegality or invalidity are
> capable of being removed and are in fact removed and the tax thus made
> legal. Sometimes this is done by providing for jurisdiction where

> earlier decision of the court which becomes ineffective after the change of
> the law. Whichever method is adopted it must be within the competence of the
> legislature and legal and adequate to attain the object of validation...."
118\. Mr. Trivedi would submit that it is not necessary that there has to be
an invalid levy of tax declared by any Competent Court which can be validated
by a validating Act. There can be a validating Act-conferring jurisdiction
which was absent or validating the illegal demand of tax on the basis of wrong
interpretation of the provisions. Mr. Trivedi invited our attention to a
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of The Government of Andhra Pradesh
vs. Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd., 1975 (2) SCC 274.
Page 112 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
118\. In the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh Vs. Hindustan Machine Tools
Ltd (supra), the Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed and set aside the notice
seeking to recover property tax on the "factory" of the Company while relying
upon Section 2(15) of the Andhra Pradesh Gram Panchayats Act, 1964, defining
the term "house", on the ground that the said definition does not include
"factory" and hence no tax could be recovered, since the demand in that behalf
was illegal. When the appeal of the State against the judgment of the High
Court was pending before the Apex Court, State Legislature retrospectively
amended the said Section 2(15) of the said Act so as to eliminate the
impediment on which the High Court rested its judgment.
119\. However, ultimately, while upholding the demand of tax retrospectively,
it was observed as under:
> "We see no substance in the respondent's contention that by re-defining the
> term 'house' with retrospective effect and by validating the levies imposed
> under the unamended Act as if notwithstanding anything contained in any
> judgment, decree or order of any court, that Act as amended was in force on
> the date when the tax was levied, the Legislature has encroached upon a
> judicial function. The power of the Legislature to pass a law postulates the
> power the pass it prospectively as well as retrospectively, the one no less
> than the other. Within the scope of its legislative competence and subject
> to other constitutional limitation, the power of the Legislature to enact
> laws is plenary. In United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum, Gwyer, C.J. while
> repelling the argument that Indian Legislatures had no power to alter the
> existing laws retrospectively observed that within the limits of their
> powers the Indian Legislatures were as supreme and sovereign as the British
> Parliament itself and that the powers were not subject to the "strange and
> unusual prohibition against retrospective legislation".

CAV JUDGMENT
> The power to validate a law retrospectively is, subject to the limitations
> aforesaid, an ancillary power to legislate on the particular subject".
120\. Mr. Trivedi submitted that in the case on hand also, a show-cause notice
dated 3rd November, 2017 for revision came to be quashed and set aside by this
High Court on the ground that the same was time barred in accordance with the
provisions of Section 75 of the VAT Act, as a result of which, the State
Legislature, instead of amending the said Section 75 of the VAT Act, inserted
a new Section 84A and thereby enlarged the remission period available under
Section 75 of the Act. Mr. Trivedi would submit that the statutes of
limitation are retrospective in nature when they deal with the procedural law
and they are prospective when they deal with the substantive right unless the
same are expressly or by implication made retrospective. According to Mr.
Trivedi, there is no bar under the Constitution that a statute of limitation
impacting a substantive right cannot be made retrospective in nature. Thus,
even if Section 84A of the VAT Act is considered to be not a validating Act,
but simply a statutory provision relating to limitation, then in that case
also, the same is rightly brought into picture with retrospective effect.
121\. Mr. Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the writ
applicant vehemently submitted that Section 84A is a substantive provision and
cannot be labelled as a validating enactment. According to Mr. Soparkar, in
the case on hand, there is absolutely no levy which is sought to be validated
by Section 84A of the VAT Act. It retrospectively extends the period of
limitation for assessment/reassessment/revision in cases where there are
pending proceedings in some other  Page 114 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT cases which result into a
judgment in favour of the Revenue.
122\. The question that falls for our consideration is whether Section 84A of
the VAT Act is a validating Act?.
123\. The Supreme Court, in the case of Amrendra Kumar Mohapatra vs. State of
Orissa, (2014) 4 SCC 583 has very succinctly explained the concept of
validating Act. We quote the relevant observations;
> "22. Black's Law Dictionary (9th Edition, Page No.1545) defines a Validation
> Act as "a law that is amended either to remove errors or to add provisions
> to conform to constitutional requirements".
> To the same effect is the view expressed by this Court in Hari Singh &
> Others v. The Military Estate Officer and Anr. (1972) 2 SCC 239, where this
> Court said "
> 21.The meaning of a Validating Act is to remove the causes for
> ineffectiveness or invalidating of actions or proceedings, which are
> validated by a legislative measure".
> In ITW Signode India Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise (2004) 3 SCC 48,
> this Court described Validation Act to be an Act that "44. removes actual or
> possible voidness, disability or other defect by confirming the validity of
> anything which is or may be invalid".
> 23\. The pre-requisite of a piece of legislation that purports to validate
> any act, rule, action or proceedings were considered by this Court in Shri
> Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. and Ann v. Broach Borough Municipality and Ors.
> (1969) 2 SCC 283. Two essentials were identified by this Court for any such
> legislation to be valid. These are:
> (a) The legislature enacting the Validation Act should be competent to enact
> the law and;
Page 115 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT
(b) the cause for ineffectiveness or invalidity of the Act or the proceedings
needs to be removed.
24\. The Court went on to enumerate certain ways in which the objective
referred to in (b) above could be achieved by the legislation and observed :
"4......... Sometimes this is done by providing for jurisdiction where
jurisdiction had not been properly invested before. Sometimes this is done by
re-enacting retrospectively a valid and legal taxing provision and then by
fiction making the tax already collected to stand under the re-enacted law.
Sometimes the Legislature gives its own meaning and interpretation of the law
under which the tax was collected and by legislative fiat makes the new
meaning binding upon courts. The Legislature may follow any one method or all
of them and while it does so it may neutralise the effect of the earlier
decision of the court which becomes ineffective after the change of the law.
Whichever method is adopted it must be within the competence of the
legislature and legal and adequate to attain the object of validation. If the
Legislature has the power over the subject- matter and competence to make a
valid law, it can at any time make such a valid law and make it
retrospectively so as to bind even past transactions. The validity of a
Validating Law, therefore, depends upon whether the Legislature possesses the
competence which it claims over the subject-matter and whether in making the
validation it removes the defect which the courts had found in the existing
law and makes adequate provisions in the Validating Law for a valid imposition
of the tax." (emphasis supplied)
25\. Judicial pronouncements regarding validation laws generally deal with
situations in which an act, rule, action or proceedings has been found by a
Court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and the legislature has stepped
in to validate the same. Decisions of this Court which are a legion take the
view that while adjudication of rights is essentially a judicial function, the
power to validate an invalid law or to legalise an illegal action is within
the exclusive province of the legislature. Exercise of that power by the
legislature is not, therefore, an encroachment on the judicial power of the
Court. But, when the validity of any such Validation Act is called in
question, the Court would have to carefully examine the  Page 116 of 152
Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT law
and determine whether (i) the vice of invalidity that rendered the act, rule,
proceedings or action invalid has been cured by the validating legislation
(ii) whether the legislature was competent to validate the act, action,
proceedings or rule declared invalid in the previous judgments and (iii)
whether such validation is consistent with the rights guaranteed by Part III
of the Constitution. It is only when the answer to all these three questions
is in the affirmative that the Validation Act can be held to be effective and
the consequences flowing from the adverse pronouncement of the Court held to
have been neutralised. Decisions of this Court in Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills
Ltd. and Anr. V. Broach Borough Municipality and Ors. (1969) 2 SCC 283, Hari
Singh v. Military Estate Officer (1972) 2 SCC 239, Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union
of India (1978) 2 SCC 50, Indian Aluminium Co. etc. v. State of Kerala and
Ors. (1996) 7 SCC 637, Meerut Development Authority etc. v. Satbir Singh and
Ors. etc. (1996) 11 SCC 462, and ITW Signode India Ltd. v. Collector of
Central Excise (2004) 3 SCC 48 fall in that category.
26\. Even in the realm of service law, validation enactments have subsequent
to the pronouncement of competent Courts come about validating the existing
legislation. Decisions of this Court in I.N. Saksena v. State of Madhya
Pradesh (1976) 4 SCC 750, Virender Singh Hooda and Ors. v. State of Haryana
and Anr. (2004) 12 SCC 588 and State of Bihar and Ors. v. Bihar Pensioners
Samaj (2006) 5 SCC 65 deal with that category of cases.
27\. In the case at hand, the State of Orissa had not suffered any adverse
judicial pronouncement to necessitate a Validation Act, as has been the
position in the generality of the cases dealt with by this Court. The title of
the impugned Legislation all the same describes the legislation as a
Validation Act. The title of a statute is no doubt an important part of an
enactment and can be referred to for determining the general scope of the
legislation. But the true nature of any such enactment has always to be
determined not on the basis of the label given to it but on the basis of its
substance.
28\. In M.P.V. Sundararamier & Co. v. State of A.P. & Anr. AIR 1958 SC 468
this Court was considering whether the impugned enactment was a Validation Act
in the true  Page 117 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT sense. This Court held that although the short
title as also the marginal note described the Act to be a Validation Act, the
substance of the legislation did not answer that description. This Court
observed: "It is argued that to validate is to confirm or ratify, and that can
be only in respect of acts which one could have himself performed, and that if
Parliament cannot enact a law relating to sales tax, it cannot validate such a
law either, and that such a law is accordingly unauthorised and void. The only
basis for this contention in the Act is its description in the Short Title as
the "Sales Tax Laws Validation Act" and the marginal note to s. 2, which is
similarly worded. But the true nature of a law has to be determined not on the
label given to it in the statute but on its substance. Section 2 of the
impugned Act which is the only substantive enactment therein makes no mention
of any validation. It only provides that no law of a State imposing tax on
sales shall be deemed to be invalid merely because such sales are in the
course of inter-State trade or commerce. The effect of this provision is
merely to liberate the State laws from the fetter placed on them by Art.
286(2) and to enable such laws to operate on their own terms." (emphasis
supplied)
29\. We may also refer to Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edn.,
page 6), where on the basis of authorities on the subject, short title of the
Act has been held to be irrelevant for the purpose of interpretation of
statutes. Lord Moulton in Vacher and Sons Ltd. v. London Society of
Compositors [1913] AC 107 described the short title of an Act as follows:
"A title given to the act is solely for the purpose of facility of reference.
If I may use the phrase, it is a statutory nickname to obviate the necessity
of always referring to the Act under its full and descriptive title....Its
object is identification and not description." (emphasis supplied) "
124\. The law relating to validating statutes in general is to be found in a
catena of judgments. We can do no better than to quote paragraph 4 from the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Shri P.C. Mills Vs. Broach
Municipality, AIR  Page 118 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST
2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT 1970 SC 192 rendered by a Constitution
Bench of five Judges :
> "4. Before we examine Section 3 to find out whether it is effective in its

125\. In the case of D. Cawasji and Co. Vs. State of Mysore 1984 (supp). SCC
490, the issue related to constitutionality of Mysore Sales Tax Amendment Act,
1969 which provided for levy of higher rate of tax with retrospective effect
to nullify the judgment and order of the High Court for refund of excess
amount of tax illegally collected. On the basis of Articles 14 and 19, the Act
was held to be unconstitutional being unreasonable and arbitrary. The Court
further held that the Act in question could not be considered to be a
validating Act because in words of the Court -
> "A validating Act seeks to validate earlier Acts declared illegal and
> unconstitutional by courts by removing the defect or lacunae which led to
> invalidation of the law. With the removal of the defect or lacunae resulting
> in the validation of any Act held invalid by a competent court, the Act may
> become valid, if the validating Act is lawfully enacted. ........ The
> retrospective operation of a validating Act properly passed curing the
> defects and lacunae which might have led to invalidity of any act done may
> be upheld, if considered reasonable and legitimate."
126\. The legislative power conferred on the appropriate Legislatures to enact
laws in respect of topics covered by the several entries in the three lists
can be exercised both prospectively and retrospectively.
127\. Where the Legislature can make a valid law, (i) it may provide only for
the prospective operation of the material  Page 120 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT provisions of the said
law (ii) it can provide for the retrospective operation of thee said
provisions or (iii) it may provide retrospective as also prospective operation
of the said provisions.
128\. As held by the Supreme Court in case of Krishnamurthi & Co. Etc vs State
of Madras 1972 AIR 2455, the legislative power, in addition includes the
subsidiary or auxiliary power to validate laws which have been found to be
invalid. If a law passed by the Legislature is struck down by the court as
being invalid for one infirmity or another, it would be competent to the
appropriate Legislature to cure the said infirmity and pass a validating law
so as to make the provisions of the said earlier law effective from the date
when it was passed.
129\. Accordingly, the retrospective amendment may be passed with or without
validation. Reference may be made to following Acts passed by The Gujarat
State Legislature which are retrospective amendments with validation.
130\. Section 8 of the Bombay Motor Vehicle Tax (Gujarat Amendment and
Validation) Act, 2002 (Gujarat Act No. 9 of 2002) reads as under:
> "8. Validation of imposition and collection of tax on designated omnibuses:-
> (1)Notwithstanding any judgement, decree or order of any court, tax imposed,

131\. Section 5 of the Gujarat Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2002
(Gujarat Act, No. 15 of 2002) reads as under:
"5. Validation of levy and collection of tax on specified works contract:-

be deemed always to have been validly deducted, levied, assessed, reassessed
or collected in accordance with law as if the provisions of the principal Act

(b) `no court, tribunal or other authority shall enforce any decree or under

132\. Section 4 of the Gujarat Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act, 1989 reads as
under:
> "4.Validation of remission of interest and deferred payment of tax:-
> "Any interest payable by the owner for any period has been waived or any
> deferment of payment of tax granted by any order of the State Government
> before the commencement of this Act shall be and shall be deemed always to

> provisions of sections 18 and 19 of the principal Act as amended by this Act
> had been in force at all material time when such interest was waived or the
> deferment of payment was granted."
133\. On a bare perusal of the above referred amendment Acts, it is evident
that the amending Act specifically provides for validation of various aspects
(namely assessment, re- assessment, collection etc.) notwithstanding any
judgement, decree or order of any court, Tribunal or authority to the
contrary.
134\. We shall once again look into Section 84A of the Gujarat Value Added Tax
(Amended Act) 2017. The same reads thus:-
> "84A(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, an issue on which
> the Appellate Authority or the Appellate Tribunal or the High Court has

> the decision of the High Court or the date of the decision of the High Court
> and the date of the decision of the Supreme Court shall be excluded in
> computing the period of limitation referred to in section 73 of section 75".
135\. Vide the Gujarat Value Added Tax (amendment) Act, 2018 (Gujarat Act No.
10 of 2017) Section 84A has been inserted in the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act,
2003 with retrospective effect. However, the amending Act does not provide for
any validation of various acts of the revenue authorities namely the
assessment, re-assessment, collection etc. Accordingly, the said Act cannot be
treated as a "validating Act".
136\. Section 84A (as inserted by 2017 amendment Act), provides for exclusion
of certain period spent by the revenue authorities in the appellate
proceedings for the purpose of calculating time limit for (i) audit assessment
(ii) turnover escaping assessment (iii) appeal and (iv) revision. All these
provisions provide for outer time limit of the order to be made. In case where
the orders are already made by the revenue authorities and matter is closed,
the retrospectives  Page 125 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST
2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT amendment without validation may not
validate such orders.
137\. In Indian Aluminium Co. and others v. State of Kerala and others, (1996)
7 SCC 637, the Government of Kerala issued a statutory order levying surcharge
on electricity. The order was declared by the Court to be ultra vires followed
by a direction to refund the amount collected thereunder. The State
Legislature introduced a Validating Act, which was impugned unsuccessfully
before the High Court as also the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court laid down
the following tests for judging the validity of the Validating Act: (i)
whether the Legislature enacting the Validating Act has competence over the
subject-matter, (ii) whether by validation, the Legislature has removed the
defect which the Court had found in the previous law; (iii) whether the
validating law is inconsistent (sic consistent) with the provisions of Part
III of the Constitution. If these tests are satisfied, the Act can with
retrospective effect validate the past transactions which were declared to be
unconstitutional. The Legislature cannot assume power of adjudicating a case
by virtue of its enactment of the law without leaving it to the judiciary to
decide it with reference to the law in force. The Legislature also is
incompetent to overrule the decision of a Court without properly removing the
base on which the judgment is founded. The Supreme Court on a review of
judicial opinion, proceeded to lay down the following principles among others
so as to maintain the delicate balance in the exercise of the sovereign powers
by the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary :-
"(i) in order that rule of law permeates to fulfil constitutional objectives
of establishing an egalitarian  Page 126 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16
20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT social order, the respective
sovereign functionaries need free play in their joints so that the march of
social progress and order remains unimpeded;
(ii) in its anxiety to safeguard judicial power, it is unnecessary to be
overzealous and conjure up incursion into the judicial preserve invalidating
the valid law competently made;
(iii) the Court, therefore, needs to carefully scan the law to find out; (a)
whether the vice pointed out by the Court and invalidity suffered by previous
law is cured complying with the legal and constitutional requirements;
(b) whether the Legislature has competence to validate the law; (c) whether
such validation is consistent with the rights guaranteed in Part III of the
Constitution;
(iv) the Court does not have the power to validate an invalid law or to
legalise impost of tax illegally made and collected or to remove the norm of
invalidation or provide a remedy. These are not judicial functions but the
exclusive province of the Legislature. Therefore, they are not encroachment on
judicial power;
(v) in exercising legislative power, the Legislature by mere declaration,
without anything more, cannot directly overrule, revise or override a judicial
decision. It can render judicial decision ineffective by enacting valid law on
the topic within its legislative field fundamentally altering or changing its
character retrospectively. The changed or altered conditions are such that the
previous decision would not have been rendered by the Court, if those
conditions had existed at the time of declaring the law as invalid......... It
is competent for the Legislature to enact the law with retrospective effect;

138\. Thus, it is permissible for the Legislature, subject to its legislative
competence otherwise, to enact a law which will withdraw or fundamentally
alter the very basis on which a judicial pronouncement has proceeded and
create a situation which if it had existed earlier, the Court would not have
made the pronouncement.
139\. Thus, we find it difficult to take the view that the VAT Amendment Act,
2018 is a validating Act.
140\. We, once again, go back to the issue with regard to the competence of
the State Legislature to enact Section 84A of the Act.
141\. In Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P. (AIR 1955 SC 781), while
considering the validity of the pre-Constitution Act the Supreme Court
observed: "All laws, existing or future, which are inconsistent with the
provisions of Part III of the Constitution are by the express provisions of
Article 13 rendered void to the extent of such inconsistency. Such laws were
not dead for all purposes. They existed for the purpose of pre-Constitution
rights and liabilities and they remained  Page 128 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu
Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT operative even after
the Constitution as against non-citizens." In Sundaramier and Co. v. State of
Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1958 SC 468) the main point for determination was the
validity of the Sales Tax Validation Act 1956, a Madras Act. Venkataram Aiyar,
J. reviewed the authorities and thereafter concluded:-
> "Thus a legislation on a topic not within the competence of the Legislature
> and a legislation within its competence but violative of Constitutional
> limitations have both the same reckoning in a Court of Law; they are both of
> them unenforceable. But does it follow from this that both the laws are of
> the same quality and character and stand on the same footing for all
> purposes.... If a law is on a field not within the domain of the

> assigned to the Legislature but its provisions disregard Constitutional
> prohibitions, though the law would be unenforceable by reason of those
> prohibitions, when once they are removed, the law will become effective
> without re-enactment."
142\. The above observations show that a law enacted by a legislature without
having legislative competence would be void ab initio and the same cannot be
revived or revitalised even if the legislative competence is conferred on that
legislature subsequently. But in a case where the legislature has legislative
competence to enact a law, and some of its provisions violate any of the
fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution, the same would
be rendered void under Article 13(2) of the Constitution and would remain
unenforceable. The law so enacted is not wiped off the Statute Book nor it
stands repealed. Further if the offending provisions of the Statute which
violate fundamental rights are removed the law would become effective and
enforceable  Page 129 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT even without re-enactment. Such a law, whether
pre- Constitution or post-Constitution, is not wholly dead if it violates
fundamental rights; it is merely eclipsed by fundamental right and remains as
it were in a moribund condition as long as the shadow of fundamental rights
falls upon it. When that shadow is removed the law begins to operate proprio
vigore from the date of such removal unless it is retrospective. A law
declared void by a court is not effected from the Statute Book; it is revived
and revitalised if Constitutional limitations are removed by Constitutional
amendment or by re-enactment by legislature.
143\. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we have reached to the conclusion
that Section 84A of the Gujarat Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 2018 is
invalid on the ground that the same is beyond the legislative competence of
the State Legislature.
IS SECTION 84A OF THE GUJARAT VAT (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2017 MANIFESTLY ARBITRARY
AND UNREASONABLE?
144\. The aforesaid takes us now to consider the question whether Section 84A
of the VAT Act is manifestly arbitrary and is liable to be struck down being
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
145\. Mr. Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the writ
applicant submitted that Section 84A of the VAT Act is manifestly arbitrary
and violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)
(g) respectively of the Constitution of India. He would submit that when the
assessment for a particular year attains finality,  Page 130 of 152 Downloaded
on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT the same
creates a vested right in favour of the dealer. The dealer would arrange his
affairs of business considering the fact that his liability has crystallized
for the periods where the assessments have attained finality. Alteration of
such position without any definite time limit only on the ground that the
judgment in favour of the Revenue has been pronounced by a Court in another
case, with which, the concerned dealer has nothing to do, could be termed as
manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable. Mr. Soparkar would submit that the
legislation which is found to be manifestly arbitrary is liable to be struck
down is now a well settled position of law in view of the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Shayara Bano vs. Union of India, (2017) 9 SCC 1,
It is argued that the test of manifest arbitrariness would apply to invalid
legislation as well as to subordinate legislation under Article 14 of the
Constitution.
146\. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the impugned amendment leads to an absurd
and unforeseen consequences. To illustrate, Mr. X of Surat selling cotton yarn
was assessed to tax for the year 2006-07 at the rate of 5% in March, 2010.
Such assessment was not challenged by either side and the same attained
finality. For the same period, an issue was raised in the case of Mr.Y of
Rajkot demanding tax at the rate of 15% on the cotton yarn. Mr. Y, however,
succeeded before the appellate authority and the rate of tax was held to be
5%. The department preferred appeal before the Tribunal and the same was
pending. In the year 2025 the matter in the case of Mr. Y reaches the Supreme
Court and the Apex Court in the case of Mr. Y holds that the applicable rate
of tax on cotton yarn is 15%. In such facts and circumstances, the impugned
Page 131 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT amendment will enable the authorities to revise in the year 2025
the assessment order passed in the case of Mr. X of Surat in the year 2010.
147\. Mr. Soparkar invited our attention to the provision of Section 64 of the
VAT Act, which reads as under;
> "64.The dealer shall preserve his books of accounts and the records relevant
> for the purpose of this Act till the period of six years from the end of the
> accounting year to which the books of accounts and the records relate.
> Provided that where the dealer is a party to an appeal or revision under
> this Act, he shall preserve the books of accounts and the records pertaining
> to the subject matter of such appeal or revision until the appeal or
> revision is finally disposed of."
148\. Thus, the provision requires the dealer to preserve books of accounts
only for a period of six years from the end of the relevant accounting year.
The proviso thereto requires further preservation of books of accounts only to
the extent a matter is pending in appeal or revision. However, the impugned
provision exposes the dealer to assessment/re- assessment/revision for an
indefinite period which is excessive and disproportionate. In fact, the
retrospective operation of the provision w.e.f 1st April, 2006 allows
reopening of assessments of years in respect of which a dealer was not
required to preserve the books of accounts and, therefore, the retrospective
operation is all the more onerous and manifestly arbitrary.
149\. In the last, Mr. Soparkar submitted that the retrospective operation of
Section 84A of the VAT Act makes the same all the more oppressive.

CAV JUDGMENT
150\. Mr. Trivedi, in response to the aforesaid submissions, submitted that
Section 84A of the VAT Act , cannot be termed as arbitrary in any manner.
According to him, there is a clear context in bringing Section 84A of the VAT
Act with retrospective operation inasmuch as the sole intention behind
enacting the same is to safeguard the interest of the Revenue by seeking to
recover which is legitimately due. According to Mr. Trivedi, the words
"manifestly arbitrary" means something done by the Legislature capriciously,
rationally and or without adequate determining principle, or something done
which is excessive and disproportionate. According to Mr. Trivedi, the dictum
as laid in Shayara Bano (supra) is completely misplaced.
151\. Mr. Trivedi pointed out that in the case of R.C. Tobacco Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
Union of India, reported in (2005) 7 SCC 725: AIR 2005 SC 4203, while holding
the retrospective amendment by way of Section 154 of the Finance Act, 2003, it
was observed as under;

155\. The historical development of the doctrine of arbitrariness has been
noticed by the Hon'ble Judges in Shayara Bano in detail. It would be suffice
to reproduce paragraphs 67 to 69 of the said judgment as the discussion in
these paras provide a sufficient guide as to how a doctrine of arbitrariness
is to be applied while adjudging the constitutional  Page 136 of 152

Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot
be cribbed, cabined and confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits.
From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In
fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of
law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute
monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal
both according to political logic and  Page 137 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr
16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT constitutional law and is
therefore violative of Article 14, and if it effects any matter relating to
public employment, it is also violative of Article 16. Article 14 and 16
strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of
treatment. They require that State action must be based on valid relevant
principles applicable alike to all similarly situate and it must not be guided
by any extraneous or irrelevant consideration because that would be denial of
equality. Where the operative reason for State action, as distinguished from
motive inducting from the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and
relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of permissible considerations,
it would amount to mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by Articles 14
and 16. Mala fide exercise of power and arbitrariness are different lethal
radiations emanating from the same vice: in fact the letter comprehends the
former. Both are inhibited by Articles 14 and 16.
68\. This was further flashed out in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, where
after stating that various fundamental rights must be read together and must
overlap and fertilise each other, Bhagwati, J., further amplified this
doctrine as follows: (SCC pp. 283-84, para
7) The nature and requirement of the procedure under Article 21
7.Now, the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of
Article 14: what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle
enunciated in this article? There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith
of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the
foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be
subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should
be made truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would to
violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many
aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and
doctrinaire limits. We must reiterate here what was pointed out by the
majority in E.P.Royappa v. State of T.N., namely that: (SCC p. 38, para 85)
85\. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to
arbitrariness. In fact equality and  Page 138 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr
16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT arbitrariness are sworn
enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the
whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is
implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and
constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14.
Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and
equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well
as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non- arbitrariness
pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure
contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to
be in conformity with Article 14. It must be right and just and fair and not
arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all
and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.
69\. This was further clarified in A.L.Kalra v. Project and Equipment Corpn.,
following Royappa and holding that arbitrariness is a doctrine distinct from
discrimination. It was held: (A.L.Kalra case SCC p. 328, para 19)
19\. It thus appears well settled that Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in
executive/administrative action because any action that is arbitrary must
necessarily involve the negation of equality. One need not confine the denial
of equality to a comparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a
conclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per se arbitrary itself
denies equal of (sic) protection by law. The Constitution Bench pertinently
observed in Ajay Hasia case and put the matter beyond controversy when it
said: (SCC p. 741, para 16)
16\. Wherever therefore, there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be
of the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under Article 12,
Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action.
This view was further elaborated and affirmed in D.S.Nakara v. Union of India.
In Maneka Gandhi v. Union  Page 139 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12
IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT of India it was observed that Article
14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality
of treatment. It is thus too late in the day to contend that an executive
action shown to be arbitrary is not either judicially reviewable or within the
reach of Article 14. The same view was reiterated in Babita Prasad v. State of
Bihar, SCC at p. 285, para 3."
156\. The aforenoted doctrine is, thus, treated as a facet of both Articles 14
and 21 of the Constitution.
157\. In case of The State of Jammu & Kashmir vs. Triloki Nath Khosa and ors
reported in AIR 1974 SC 1 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court upheld
the legislation classifying the Assistant Engineers into Degree-holders and
Diploma- holders respectively for the purpose of promotion. It was observed
that classification on the basis of educational qualifications made with a
view to achieving the administrative efficiency cannot be said to rest on any
fortuitous circumstances and one has always to bear in mind the facts and
circumstances in order to judge the validity of a classification. It was
observed that there is a presumption of constitutionality of a statute. The
burden is on one who canvasses that certain statute is unconstitutional to set
out facts necessary to sustain the plea of discrimination and to adduce cogent
and convincing evidence to prove those facts. In order to establish that the
protection of the equal opportunity clause has been denied to them, it is not
enough for the petitioners to say that they have been treated differently from
others, not even enough that a differential treatment has been accorded to
them in comparison with other similarly circumstanced. Discrimination is the
essence of classification and does violence to the constitutional guarantee
Page 140 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018
CAV JUDGMENT of equality only if it rests on an unreasonable basis.
158\. On the question of the grounds on which a law framed by the legislation
i.e. the parliament of the State assembly the decision of three Judge Bench of
Supreme Court in case of State of A.P. And ors vs. Macdowell and Co. and ors
reported in (1996) 3 SCC 709 held the field and was often referred. In the
said judgement, the Supreme Court had opined that the grounds for striking
down a statute framed by the legislature are only two viz. (1) lack of
legislative competence, or (2) violation of fundamental rights or any other
constitutional provision. If enactment is challenged as violative of Article
14, it can be struck down only if it is found that it is violative of the
equality clause or the equal protection clause enshrined therein. Similarly,
if an enactment is challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights
guaranteed by clauses (a) to (g) of Article 19(1), it can be struck down only
if it is found not saved by any of the clauses (2) to (6). No enactment can be
struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable.
'Arbitrariness' is an expression used widely and rather indiscriminately-an
expression of inherently imprecise import. Hence, some or the other
constitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating the Act. An
enactment cannot be struck down on the ground that the Court thinks it
unjustified. The Parliament and legislatures, composed as they are of the
representatives of the people and supposed to know and be aware of the need of
the people and every what is good and bad for them. The Court cannot sit on
the judgement over their wisdom.

CAV JUDGMENT
159\. In the recent judgement of the Supreme Court in case of Shayra Bano vs.
Union of India and ors reported in (2017) 9 SCC 1, Rohinton Fali Nariman, J.,
however, expressed a somewhat different view. It was observed that a statute
can also be struck down if it is manifestly arbitrary. It was observed as
under:
> "101. It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of this Court in Indian
> Express Newspapers v. Union of India, (1985) SCC 641, stated that it was
> settled law that subordinate legislation can be challenged on any of the
> grounds available for challenge against plenary legislation. This being the
> case, there is no rational distinction between the two types of legislation
> when it comes to this ground of challenge under Article 14. The test of
> manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down in the aforesaid judgments
> would apply to invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation
> under Article
> 14\. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the
> legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining
> principle. Also, when something is done which is excessive and
> disproportionate, such legislation would be manifestly arbitrary. We are,
> therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of manifest
> arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate legislation
> as well under Article 14."
160\. It is well settled that as long as the legislation has the necessary
competence to frame a law and the law so framed is not violative of the
fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution or any of the constitutional
provision, the Court would not strike down the statute merely on the
perception that the same is harsh or unjust. Particularly, in taxing statutes
the Courts have recognized much greater latitude in the legislation in framing

judgement of Supreme Court in case of R.K.Garg vs. Union of India and ors
(supra) it was  Page 142 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020
C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT observed as under:
> "8. Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic

161\. It is equally well settled that wherever the parliament has the power to
frame a statute it also includes the power to make the law retrospective. In
other words, the parliament also has wide powers to frame the laws including
taxing statutes with retrospective effect. However, the Courts have recognized
certain inherent limitations in framing retrospective tax legislations.
162\. In Tata Motors Ltd vs. State of Maharashtra and ors reported (2004) 5
SCC 783, it was observed that it is undoubtedly true that the legislature has
the powers to make  Page 144 of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST
2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT laws retrospectively including the tax
laws. Levies can be imposed or withdrawn but if a particular levy is sought to
be imposed only for a particular period and not prior or subsequently, it is
open to debate whether the statute passes the test of reasonableness at all.
163\. In Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Vatika Township petitioner. Ltd
reported in 367 ITR 466 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court observed
as under:
> "31. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted,
> one established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a
> legislation is presumed not to be intended to have a retrospective
> operation. The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern
> current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past.
> If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today and in
> force and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature
> of the law is founded on the bed rock that every human being is entitled to
> arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law and should not find that
> his plans have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is known as
> lex prospicit non respicit : law looks forward not backward. As was observed
> in Phillips vs. Eyre[3], a retrospective legislation is contrary to the
> general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be
> regulated when introduced for the first time to deal with future acts ought
> not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith
> of the then existing law.
> 32\. The obvious basis of the principle against retrospectivity is the

> accrued rights or which impose obligations or impose new duties or attach a
> new disability have to be treated as prospective unless the  Page 145 of 152
> Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV JUDGMENT
> legislative intent is clearly to give the enactment a retrospective effect;
> unless the legislation is for purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a

> 33\. We would also like to point out, for the sake of completeness, that

> retrospective construction is different. If a legislation confers a benefit
> on some persons but without inflicting a corresponding detriment on some
> other person or on the public generally, and where to confer such benefit
> appears to have been the legislators object, then the presumption would be

> are confronted with any such situation here."
164 The illustration given by Mr. Soparkar for the purpose of demonstrating
that the impugned amendment is arbitrary and unreasonable is quite apt.
165\. We are of the view that if unlimited time period is available to the
Revenue for assessment/re- assessment/revision in any case based on a decision
rendered in the case of any other dealer the same would lead to an  Page 146
of 152 Downloaded on : Thu Apr 16 20:51:12 IST 2020 C/SCA/14206/2018 CAV
JUDGMENT irreparable situation and, in such circumstances, it renders Section
84A manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.
166 Then we are taking about unreasonableness in the impugned provision, we
should look into the English decision in the case of Kruse vs. Johnson
(1895-90) All ER 105. It has been observed as under:
> ""Unreasonableness in what sense! If for instance they were found to be
> partial and unequal in their operation between different classes, if they
> were manifestly unjust, if they disclosed bad faith, if they involved such
> oppressive or gratuitous interference with rights of those subject to them
> as could find no justification in the minds of the reasonable men, the Court
> might well say parliament never intended to give authority to make such
> rules and that they are unreasonable and ultra vires ."
> 24\. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving

> 167\. In the case of Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1998) 111
> STC 467 (SC), the Supreme Court observed that allowing refund claims beyond

> cases would "do violence to several well-accepted principles of law. It was

Even so an action taken by the State cannot be so irrational and so arbitrary
that it creates a situation like the one in case on hand.
169\. In view of the above, we hold that Section 84A of the VAT Act is liable
to be struck down even on the ground of being manifestly arbitrary, excessive,
oppressive and unreasonable.
170\. Our final conclusions may be summarized as under;
(i) Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act is ultra vires and beyond the
legislative competence of the State Legislature.
(ii) Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable
and therefore, violative of the Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution
of India.
(iii) Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act is not a validating Act.
171\. In view of the aforesaid discussion, all the writ applications succeed
and are hereby allowed. Section 84A of the Gujarat VAT Act is declared as
ultra vires and beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature
under Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India
and is also declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India on the ground of being manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable and
oppressive.
