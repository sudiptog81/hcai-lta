Reliance Industries Ltd.
Appellant Vs.
Commissioner of Central Excise & Service Tax, LTU, Mumbai Respondent
it cannot be said that there is any intention to evade payment of duty, which
is a pre-requisite for invoking the extending period of limitation. In the
instant case also if any tax was payable it could have been available
immediately to the Appellant, thereby rendering the entire dispute being
revenue neutral. This being the case the invocation of extended period of
limitation is clearly not justified:-
a) Reliance Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (244) ELT 254 (Tri)
b) CCE vs Indios Abeis Ltd 2010 (254) ELT 628 HC Guj
c) Mafatlal Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (241) ELT 153 (T); affirmed by the Apex
Court by dismissing the Civil Appeal reported in 2010 (255) ELT A77 (SC)
d) Nirlon Ltd vs CCE 2015 (320) ELT 22 (SC)
13\. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside
with consequential relief in accordance with law.

Commissioner of Central Excise & Service Tax, LTU, Mumbai Respondent
Appearance:
Shri Vipin Kumar Jain, Advocate Ms. Shilpa Balani, Advocate for appellant Shri
D. Nagvenkar, Addl. Commr (AR) for respondent CORAM:
Honble Mr. M.V. Ravindran, Member (Judicial) Honble Mr. C.J. Mathew, Member
(Technical) Date of Hearing: 10.02.2016 Date of Decision: 21.06.2016 ORDER
NO Per: M.V. Ravindran By the impugned order the Respondent has
confirmed the demand of service tax along with interest and penalty on the
Appellant, under the Reverse charge mechanism, on the premise that it ought to
have discharged service tax under the head of Intellectual Property Services
(IPR for short) on the amount remitted by it to various overseas entities
towards the right to use/enjoy confidential/technical know-how and patents
held by such overseas entities.
2\. It is an undisputed fact that out of the six different agreement in terms
of which the right to use/enjoy confidential/technical know-how and patent
have been granted, only the patent in respect of Investa Technologies
s.a.r.l., is registered in India under the Patents Act 1970\. In respect of
the remaining agreements, there is no patent, which is registered under the
Patents Act, 1970.
3\. The Appellant had resisted the demand on the following counts:
(a) A perusal of the definition of the terms Intellectual Property Right, and
Intellectual Property service as defined in Section 65(55A) and Section 65
(55b) would show that it is only such Intellectual Property i.e.
recognised/enforceable under the laws for the time being enforced in India,
taxable.
Section 65 (55a)-intellectual property right means any right to intangible
property, namely, trademarks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible
property, under any law for the time being in force, but does not include
copyright;
Section 65 (55b) intellectual property service means, 
(i) transferring, [temporarily]; or
(ii) permitting the use or enjoyment of, any intellectual property right;]
(b) The CBEC has in its Circular No.80/10/2004-ST dated 17.9.2004 clarified
that the expressions law for the time being in force, in the context of IPR
services mean such laws as are applicable in India.
(c). That confidential information/technical know-how (undisclosed
information) is undisputedly, not recognised as an IPR and consequently there
can be no tax under the head of IPR services in respect of the same.
(d). With respect of Investa Technologies, the agreement had been entered into
14.8.2004 much prior to the taxable head of IPR Services have been introduced
in the Finance Act, 1994 with effect from 10.9.2004.
(e) The extended period of limitation was not invokable inasmuch as the entire
transaction was revenue neutral.
4\. The Learned AR appearing on behalf of the revenue has reiterated the
findings of the Revenue and submitted that the service were aptly classified
under IPR and that the extended period of limitation has rightly been invoked.
5\. We have heard the submissions of both sides. The primary issue that arises
for determination is whether an Intellectual Property Right, which is not
recognised under the Indian laws for the time being in force would constitute
an Intellectual Property Right, the temporary transfer or the right to use or
enjoyment of which is liable to tax under the head of IPR services.
6\. While deciding this we have to bear in mind that India is a signatory to
the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Properties. The said
convention was the first major step taken to help creators of intellectual
property to ensure that their intellectual works were protected in other
countries. In furtherance to the same a Patent Cooperation Treaty, was signed
by member countries, the same has been embodied in Chapter XXII of the Patents
Act, 1970. The said treaty spells out a detailed mechanism for the filing of
international applications by an inventor and provides that once such an
application is made and registered in the member country, then the IPR would
be protected in that member country. Thus, there appears to be a codified law
providing for recognition and Protection under the Indian Laws even in respect
of Patents registered overseas. In our view when the legislature has
specifically provided that an Intellectual Property Right, that could be taxed
as an IPR service is a right to an intangible property, which is recognised
under any law for the time being in force, obviously the law being referred to
here has to be an Indian Law and not the recognition of the intangible
property right under the law of a third country. If an intangible property
right was to refer to a right which is recognised by any country, then the
legislature would not have used the expression under any law for the time
being in force. The legislature would have merely stated that an
intellectual property right would mean any right to an intangible property.
There would have been no need for it to qualify the same with a recognition
under any law for the time being in force.
7\. It would be clearly incongruous to suggest that an intellectual property
right such as a patent or a trade mark is not protected or recognised by the
Indian Law, yet the grant of the right to use or a temporary transfer of such
a patent or trade mark, which is otherwise not recognised in Indian as a
Intellectual Property Right would attract liability to service tax under the
head of IPR services. The legislature has in accordance with the global treaty
for protection of IPR world over laid down the agreed procedure that any
inventor if required to follow, so as to have the patent and trademarks
recognised and protected under the Indian laws. If any inventor does not seek
protection of its intellectual property under the Indian laws, the same cannot
be regarded as an intellectual property right for the purpose of taxing the
grant of right to use such a right. The question whether such a service could
be taxed under a different head is irrelevant and does not arise as there is
no such case made out in the notice.
8\. It is also relevant to note here that if the interpretation suggested by
the Respondent to the effect that Intellectual property right even if not
recognised in India could still be taxed under the head of IPR services if
taken as correct it would lead to the expression under any law for the time
being in force being rendered redundant an otiose. It is a settled principle
of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Aphali Pharmaceuticals Ltd
Vs State of Maharashtra 1989 (44) ELT 613 that any interpretation which has
the effect of rendering any part of the statute redundant and otiose it is to
eschewed in favour of an interpretation that would harmonise the same.
9\. The CBEC has also in its Circular dated 80/10/2004-ST dated 17.9.2004 was
issued while explaining the scope and ambit of the different heads of taxing
services which were introduced by the Finance (No.2)Bill 2004 has clarified in
no uncertain terms that the phrase law for the time being in force implied
such laws as are applicable in India and that IPR covered under Indian law in
force were alone chargeable to service tax. It was further clarified that
IPRs like integrated circuits or undisclosed information, which was not
recognised under Indian laws would not be covered under the said taxable
services of IPR. We are in complete agreement with this clarification issued
by the CBEC and do not find any reason to disagree with the same. In view of
the above, there can be no liability to tax under the head of IPR services in
respect of an Intellectual Property Right that is not recognised by the law in
India. In the facts of the present case except for the Patent with respect to
Investa Technologies S.A.R.L. which was recognised under the Patents Act 1970
in India none of the alleged Intellectual Property Rights are recognised under
the Indian law and as such there cannot be any tax on the same under the head
of IPR services, as the same do not qualify as an Intellectual Property Right,
the transfer (temporary) or permitting the right to use or enjoyment of which
is liable to service tax.
9.1 We also note that a co-ordinate bench of the Tribunal has in the case of
TCS vs CST 2016 (41) STR 121 (T) taken a view similar to the one taken by us
above. The relevant observations of the Tribunal read as under :
4.?The taxable service under consideration is defined under Section
65(105)(zzr) to mean any service provided or to be provided to any person, by
the holder of Intellectual Property Right, in relation to Intellectual
Property Service. Intellectual Property Service is defined under Section
65(55b) to mean (a) transferring (temporarily); or (b) permitting the use or
enjoyment of, any intellectual property right. And Intellectual Property Right
as defined under Section 65(55a) means any right to intangible property,
namely, trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible
property, under any law for the time being in force, but does not include
copyright.
4.1?Short question to be decided is whether the transfer of technical know
how received by the Appellant is a service which may be categorized under
Intellectual Property Right Services. We find that the definition of
Intellectual Property Right must be satisfied to term the services received by
the Appellant as Intellectual Property Right Services. We find no clue at all
in the records as to which type of Intellectual Property Right is being
assigned to the Technical know-how received by the Appellant. It is obvious
from the definition of Intellectual Property Right that the right has to be a
specific Right under a specific Law. Examples are given under the definition
such as the Trade Mark which is a right provided under Trade Marks Act.
Similarly the right mentioned as design in the definition is a right under
the Designs Act. Therefore we find that the technical know-how received by
the Appellant and the royalty payment made by the Appellant to Unisys is
nowhere established to result from the use of any Intellectual Property Right.
4.2?We may further go on to add that the Intellectual Property Right should be
a right under the Indian law. Intellectual Property Right not covered by the
Indian laws would not be covered under taxable service in the category of
Intellectual Property Right Services. We are fortified in our view by Board
Circular F. No. 80/10/2004-S.T., dated 17-9-2004 which clarified that
Intellectual Property emerges from application of intellect, which may be in
the form of an invention, design, product, process, technology, book,
goodwill, etc. In India, legislations are made in respect of certain
Intellectual Property Rights (i.e. IPRs) such as patents, copyrights,
trademarks and designs. The definition of taxable service includes only such
IPRs (except copyright) that are prescribed under law for the time being in
force. As the phrase law for the time being in force implies such laws as
are applicable in India, IPRs covered under Indian law in force at present
alone are chargeable to service tax and IPRs like integrated circuits or
undisclosed information (not covered by Indian law) would not be covered under
taxable services.
11\. Insofar as the agreement with Investa Technologies S.A.R.L. is concerned
the same was entered into on 14.8.2004, prior to IPR services being brought
into the net of service tax w.e.f 10.9.2004. The service itself having been
rendered prior to the introduction of the levy, the mere fact that payments
for the same were made on a staggered basis over a period of time cannot be a
ground for levying service tax merely with reference to the date on which
payments were being made. We find that during the relevant period the issue as
to whether a transaction is leviable to service tax and if so at what rate was
required to be reckoned with reference to the date when the service was
rendered and not with reference to the date on which payment is made. The law
in this regard is settled by the decision of the CESTAT reported in 2008 (10)
STR 243 which was affirmed by the Honble Gujarat High Court in the
Appellants own case reported in 2010 (19) STR 807 as also by the Honble
Delhi High Court in the case of CCE vs Consulting Engineering Services India
(P) Ltd 2013 (30) STR 586.As the service in the case of Investa Technologies
S.A.R.L, was rendered prior to 10.9.2004, the date when the taxing entry was
brought to the Statute the mere subsequent payment in respect of services that
are already being rendered cannot be brought to tax with respect to the rate
applicable on the date on which the payment was effected.
12\. We also note that the entire dispute being revenue neutral, there could
have been no intention to evade payment of duty and consequently the extended
period of limitation was per se not invokable. It is settled law laid down in
the following amongst other judgements a series of judgement including that of
the Apex Court that in a case where credit is available to an assesse itself
it cannot be said that there is any intention to evade payment of duty, which
is a pre-requisite for invoking the extending period of limitation. In the
instant case also if any tax was payable it could have been available
immediately to the Appellant, thereby rendering the entire dispute being
revenue neutral. This being the case the invocation of extended period of
limitation is clearly not justified:-
a) Reliance Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (244) ELT 254 (Tri)
b) CCE vs Indios Abeis Ltd 2010 (254) ELT 628 HC Guj
c) Mafatlal Industries Ltd vs CCE 2009 (241) ELT 153 (T); affirmed by the Apex
Court by dismissing the Civil Appeal reported in 2010 (255) ELT A77 (SC)
d) Nirlon Ltd vs CCE 2015 (320) ELT 22 (SC)
13\. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside
with consequential relief in accordance with law.
