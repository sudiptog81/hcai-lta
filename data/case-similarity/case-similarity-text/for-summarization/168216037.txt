    JUDGEMENT 
This Civil Suit is filed to pass a Judgement and Decree, (a) granting
wordings. Therefore, there is nothing new in the plaintiff's patent. The ARUNA
JAGADEESAN, J.
Srcm Plaintiff was merely camouflaging a product whose discovery was known
throughout the World and trying to enfold it in their specification. In any
event, the period of patent is also already over and the claim of the
plaintiff becomes infructuous. In so far as rendering of accounts is are
concerned, in view of the conclusions arrived at above, the plaintiff cannot
claim any proprietary over the defendant's product and consequently, the
rendition of accounts cannot be granted.
24\. In so far as the counter claims are concerned, though the plaintiff's
patent is liable to be revoked due to lapse of time it has become infructuous.
The 1st defendant claimed damage of Rs.1,00,000/-. When the suit was filed,
the patent was registered and therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiff
cannot be said to be malicious or abuse of process of court. Therefore, the
counter claim of damages cannot be granted to the first defendant. The issues
are answered accordingly.
This Civil Suit is filed to pass a Judgement and Decree, (a) granting
permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their servants, agents or
anyone claiming through them from in any manner infringing the plaintiff's
Registered Patent under the title Disposable Armpit Perspiration Pad by
manufacturing and selling Disposable Armpit Perspiration Pad either under
the Trademark SWEATEX or any other mark whose Patent is similar to that of
the plaintiff's Registered Patent, (b) directing the defendants to surrender
to the plaintiff the entire stock of unused offending Disposable armpit
perspiration pad bearing the trade mark Sweatex or any other mark, (c)
directing the defendants to render a true and faithful account of the profits
earned by the defendants through the sale of the products and directing
payment of such profits to the plaintiff for the infringement committed by the
defendants and (d) directing the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs the cost
of the suit.
2\. The case of the Plaintiff as set out in in the plaint is as follows:-
a. The plaintiff is the original inventor of the patent relating to
Disposable Armpit Perspiration Pad. The invention of such armpit
perspiration pad is comprising of a oval shaped perspiration observing
membrane mounted on a moisture proof bearer element. It is used to observe the
armpit perspiration and at the the same time, to reduce the damage to the
garment. The plaintiff obtained Patent Registration No.181248 dated 21.5.1993
and the same is periodically renewed. The invention made by the plaintiff is
very unique and no one in the world has invented the same or similar product.
b. The plaintiff has been approaching the various institutions and industries
and other Government Departments to establish a factory to manufacture the
device. Coming to know about the unique invention and its use, the first
defendant has commenced manufacturing identically similar perspiration pads
under the trade mark SWEATEX at China and commenced the sale in India. The
product and the trade mark is a virtual copy of the plaintiff's registered
patent. The second defendant is a seller of the offending product in the city
of Chennai. The plaintiff, issued a notice dated 14.7.2005 to stop production
and marketing of the same, for which, the first defendant gave an evasive
reply. The defendants 1 and 2 have no manner of right, title or interest to
manufacture and sell the plaintiff's disposable armpit perspiration pad and
such manufacturing and selling amount to infringement of the patent rights of
the plaintiff. Hence, this civil suit has been filed for the reliefs as stated
above.
3\. In the Written Statement filed by the 1st Defendant, it is averred as
follows:-
a. The suit is not maintainable and this court has no jurisdiction to
entertain the suit. The second defendant is arrayed only to invoke the
jurisdiction of this court. The first defendant never appointed the second
defendant either as a dealer or as a distributor for the city of Chennai. The
plaintiff, not having commenced his manufacturing, there is no cause of action
for the suit. The alleged invention is not new, but in vogue for many years.
The second defendant approached the first defendant and sought to become a
dealer of the first defendant's products. On receiving a sum of Rs.300/-, the
first defendant sent six pieces of SWEATEX by courier as sample and it is not
a commercial sale. The plaintiff had set up the second defendant only to make
a trap purchase and thereby to invoke the jurisdiction of this court. The
first defendant's commercial activity is confined to Andhra Pradesh and has
not sold its products under the name UNDER ARM GARMENT LINER. The patent
alleged to have obtained by the plaintiff is invalid and liable to be revoked.
b. Armpit Perspiration Pad is well known for more than 100 years in the market
and there is no nothing new or novel to invent the same. Patent for armpit
perspiration pad was granted on 1.11.1870 under US patent No.108908 and in the
name of Ms.Hotchkiss . Several other patents for armpit perspiration pad have
also been granted under the US Patterns in 1980s and 1990s of the last
century. The plaintiff has copied the said patent and has registered as if it
is his own invention. The Plaintiff has not even produced a single absorbent
pad for commercial sale . The plaintiff has failed to disclose prior art and
prior patents granted in respect of absorbent pads. Having obtained
registration in 1993, the patent remained unutilised for more than 13 years
and the suit is filed only to coerce and extract money from the defendant.
Even assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to the patent, the defendant has
not infringed the patent right of the plaintiff. The product is a modern
product comprising various layers made of different materials. The product of
the defendant is a super absorbent and it contains five layers of materials,
which absorbs moisture from the skin and helps to keep away the perspiration
from the skin.
c. The defendant's garment liner contains ALOE, Vitamin-E which prevents
perspiration. It also contains deodoriser, which gives fresh smell and also
contains anti bacterial agents. Therefore, the plaintiff's patent and the
defendant's product are not identical. Since the plaintiff has approached this
court with ulterior motive, the first defendant is entitled for damages to the
tune of Rs.1,00,000/-. The third defendant is under obligation to revoke the
patent granted to the plaintiff, as it has been obtained by misrepresentation.
4\. The second defendant and the third defendant did not appear and file any
written statement.
5\. Based on the above said pleadings, the following issues were framed:-
1.Whether the product viz., A disposable armpit perspiration pad is not the
invention of the plaintiff, but it was available in the open market for over
100 years?
2.Whether the registration of the patent A disposable armpit perspiration
pad under No.181248 by the third defendant, viz., the Controller General of
Patents, Patent Office, Chennai is legally is justified or not and whether the
counter claim of the defendant praying for cancelling/removing/ expunging the
said registration by D3 is tenable?
3.Whether the plaintiff has been using the said patent A disposable armpit
perspiration pad before such registration and after such registration?
4.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction restraining the
defendants above named by themselves, their servants, agents or anyone
claiming through them from in any manner infringing the plaintiff's registered
patent under the title Disposable armpit perspiration pad by manufacturing
and selling Disposable armpit perspiration pad either under the trade mark
SWEATEX or any other mark whose patent is similar to that of the plaintiff's
registered patent Disposable armpit perspiration pad, either by
manufacturing, selling or offering for sale?
5.Whether the defendant is liable to surrender to the plaintiff the entire
stock of unused offending Disposable armpit perspiration pad bearing the
trade mark SWEATEX or any other mark?
6.Whether the first defendant is entitled to recover damages to the tune of
Rs.1 lakh from the plaintiff?
7\. To what relief?
6\. In the written statement, the first defendant has raised an issue that
this court has no jurisdiction to try the suit on the ground that the
plaintiff is having its registered office at Trivandrum, Kerala and the first
defendant is having its registered office and their commercial sale of the
disputed products confined to Andhra Pradesh and they have not appointed the
second defendant either as their agent or distributor for their product
SWEATEX. According to the 1st defendant, the 2nd Defendant enquired about the
product of the first defendant and asked for samples and the same were
supplied and the alleged trap purchase is only a set up by the plaintiff to
bring a cause of action within the jurisdiction of this court.
7\. However, no preliminary issue was raised immediately after filing of the
suit and the question of jurisdiction was not even framed as an issue.
8\. However, arguments were advanced on the question of jurisdiction and the
first defendant relied on decisions reported in 2013 -4- MLJ- 513 (F. Hoffman
La Roche vs Intas Bio Pharmaceuticals) and AIR-1981-Punjab and Haryana -17
(H.P.H.P Vs M.M. Breweries)
9\. According to the defendant, a sporadic sale does not amount to commercial
sale and therefore, this court has no jurisdiction. As far as the question of
jurisdiction is concerned, it was not raised as a preliminary issue. The case
reported in 2013 -4-MLJ- 513 cited supra relates to an appeal against an order
passed in an application, which had been filed to revoke the leave granted to
the plaintiff to institute a suit before this court. The said application was
dismissed. In appeal, the Division bench considered the well settled position
that the sporadic sale does not constitute commercial sale and held that this
court has no jurisdiction. The case referred to in AIR-1981-Punjab and Haryana
-17 cited supra, is a case decided on a preliminary issue whether the courts
have jurisdiction to try the suit.
10\. In any event, a counter claim has been made, evidence has been recorded
on other issues and it will be unnecessary to go into the question of
jurisdiction at this stage, as the defendant has not persuaded this court to
take the issue of jurisdiction as preliminary issue before going to trial. It
has to be presumed that the defendant had subjected himself for jurisdiction
of this court.
11\. It is also pertinent to note that in a case under patent law, the right
to patent comes to end after 20 years of registration and in this case, it has
come to an end in 2013. The prayer of injunction cannot be granted and the
question before this court is whether the plaintiffs is the registered owner
of the patent and if so, whether he is entitled for rendition of accounts for
the period under dispute.
12\. In so far as the counter claims made by the 1st Defendant to direct the
third defendant to revoke the registration of patent and for damage of
Rs.1,00,000/- are concerned, the former claim becomes infructuous and the
claim of damages alone has to be decided. Therefore, issue no.1 and issue no.6
alone will be relevant. However, issue No.4 has to be modified in relation to
the prayer C of the plaint, which is for rendition of accounts.
13\. It is the case of the plaintiff that he is the patent right holder of a
product Disposable Armpit Perspiration Pad. The registration in year 1993
and the subsequent renewal are not denied. In 2005, the 1st defendant
commenced selling his product of  DISPOSABLE UNDER ARM GARMENT LINER under
the trade name SWEATEX. This fact is also not denied. It is also admitted that
the plaintiff has not manufactured and sold the above said disposable armpit
perspiration pad under any trade mark, till the filing of the suit. However,
he has registered a product name SINORETA for his DISPOSABLE ARMPIT
PERSPERATION PAD.
14\. According to the 1st defendant, the concept of disposable armpit
perspiration pad or under arm perspiration pad is not a new invention, but it
is in use for more than 100 years. On the other hand , according to the
plaintiff, his patent is a new invention, which has an inventive step of
improved version and therefore, it is his patent.
15\. Reiterating the above arguments, the learned counsel for the plaintiff
would submit that the invention of the plaintiff contains five layers, which
suits tight fitting garments of tropical countries, for which there is no
prior art. It is submitted that the 1st defendant had copied the patent of the
plaintiff and they have exploited the same and there is not even a denial of
infringing the plaintiff's patent. Since the plaintiff's inventive patent has
been infringed by the first defendant, the claim of the Plaintiff is that the
first defendant is liable for rendition of account to quantify the profit, for
which the plaintiff is entitled to. The learned counsel relied on the
following case laws:-
1\. AIR 1930 Privy Council I ( Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd vs Fada Radio
Limited)
2.AIR 1969 Bom 255 (Farbewerke Hoechst vs Unichem Laboratories and Ors) 3.1986
(6) PTC 195(SC) (Monsant Company vs Coromandal Indag Products (P) Limited
4.2009 (41) PTC 260 (Del) (Chemtura Corporation vs Union of India and Ors)
5.2006(32) PTC 30 (Del) (Pfizer Products Inc vs Rajesh Chopra & Ors)
6.2007(35) PTC 377 (Del) (Hindustan Lever Limited vs Lalit Wadhwa & Anr)
7.2009(41)PTC 207 (Del) (AGC Flat Glass Europe SA vs Anand Mahajan and Ors)
The learned counsel pointed out that though prayer A and B have become
infructuous for the infringement of the patent right of the plaintiff, the
defendant has to render true and faithful accounts. The learned counsel
pointed out that the plaintiff's patent was an invention and such an invention
has not been used in India or elsewhere prior to the grant of the patent.
17\. On the contrary, Mr.R.Sathish Kumar, learned counsel for the 1st
defendant submitted that the plaintiff must prove that it is a new invention
and under Section 64 of the Patent Act, the defendant can bring material to
show that the patent is anticipated by a prior art and the same is not new or
novel. The learned counsel also pointed out that the court has to consider
whether the invention is obvious or ordinary workshop improvement of an old
subject matter and does not constitute an invention. The learned counsel
pointed out that the suit is liable to be dismissed, as it has become
infructuous and the patent is invalid and the defendant has not infringed any
patent right. The learned counsel relied on the following case laws:-
1.PTC (suppl) (1) 731 (SC) (Biswanath Prasad vs Hindustan Metal )
2\. AIR 1936 BOM 99 (Lallubhai vs Chimanlal)
3.AIR 1969 BOM 255 (Fabwerke Hoechst vs Unichem Laboratories)
4.AIR 1976 DEL 87 (Ram Narain vs Ambassador Industries)
5.AIR 1983 BOM 144 (Press Metal Corp vs Noshir Sorabhji)
18\. This court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side
and perused the materials available on record and gave its anxious
considerations.
19\. The fundamental principle of Patent Law is that a patent is granted only
for an invention, which must be new and useful and should have novelty and
utility. A patent is a monopoly, conferred by a statute as a consideration for
the inventor, for a given number of years. Section 2(j) and (j-a) of the Act
reads as follows:-
2(j) invention means a new product or process involving an inventive step and
capable of industrial application;
2(ja) inventive step means a feature of an invention that involves technical
advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance
or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the
art.
20\. The plaintiff claims a new invention for the patent of a product
'Disposable armpit perspiration pad'. He has obtained the patent under Ex.P.1.
and made five claims as under:-
1. Disposable armpit perspiration pad, especially for use on tight fitting
upper garments, comprising a substantially oval shaped perspiration absorbing
member (4), mounted on a moisture-proof barrier element (2), the underside of
said barrier element being provided with an adhesive strip(s) (3) or like
other means so as to enable the pad to be firmly secured to that portion of
the armhole/arm-sleeve of the garment which is in proximity to the armpit, a
thin film of peel-off strip (1) for covering/protecting said adhesive
strip(s), and a thin layer of cotton or absorbent cloth (5) provided over the
absorbing member to keep the same in position.
(2) A pad as claimed in Claim 1, wherein small half rounds are cut off at the
middle of the straight portions of the pad for perfect fitting of the pad to
the garment.
(3) A pad as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said absorbing member is parted
or perforated (6) at the middle so as to enable snug-fitting of the pad under
the armpit when the hand is kept down.
(4) A pad as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1 to 3, wherein one of the
two straight portions of the pad is longer than the other.
(5) A disposable armpit perspiration pad, especially for use on tight fitting
upper garments, substantially as herein described and illustrated with
reference to the accompanying drawings.
and a diagram of five layers has also been given.
21\. According to the 1st defendant, it is not a new invention, but it is in
use for more than 100 years and patented in United States of America as early
as 1870.
22\. Ex.D3 is an extract from the website of US patent office. One
Mr.Hotchkiss of Connecktkit was granted for an improved dress shield in 1870.
It is stated as under:-
Shields have here to for been made of India rubber, to be inserted within the
dress and beneath the arms, to prevent perspiration passing into the fabric of
the dress and injuring the skin.
Therefore, an invention of preventing perspiration passing into the fabric of
dress is not new. However, an useful improvement or inventive step, as
mentioned in Section 2(ja), is also a new invention. Ex.D.1 is a patent
certificate granted in the year 1985, which is also for an under arm
perspiration pad. Therefore, the patent is publicly known and publicly used .
Section 64 1(d) and 1(f) of the Patent Act reads as follows:-
S.64 : Revocation of patents:-
(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted
before or after the commencement of this Act, may, 1[be revoked on a petition
of any person interested or of the Central Government by the Appellate Board
or on a counter claim in a suit for infringement of the patent by the High
Court] on any of the following grounds that is to say .........
(d) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not an
invention within the meaning of this Act;
............
(f) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
specification is obvious or does not involve any inventive step, having regard
to what was publicly known or publicly used in India or what was published in
India or elsewhere before the priority date of the claim:
Therefore, the party claiming patent should specify as to what particular
features of his device distinguish it from those which had gone before and
show the nature of improvement which is said to constitute the invention. The
improvement should effect a new and very useful addition to the existing state
of knowledge.
23\. The claim of the plaintiff is that the new invention is an improvement to
use in tight fitting garments, which are useful in tropical countries.
However, the usefulness or utility has not been stated. A comparison of claim
made in Ex.D.1 and Ex.P.1 would show that it is the same claim with modified
wordings. Therefore, there is nothing new in the plaintiff's patent. The ARUNA
JAGADEESAN, J.
Srcm Plaintiff was merely camouflaging a product whose discovery was known
throughout the World and trying to enfold it in their specification. In any
event, the period of patent is also already over and the claim of the
plaintiff becomes infructuous. In so far as rendering of accounts is are
concerned, in view of the conclusions arrived at above, the plaintiff cannot
claim any proprietary over the defendant's product and consequently, the
rendition of accounts cannot be granted.
24\. In so far as the counter claims are concerned, though the plaintiff's
patent is liable to be revoked due to lapse of time it has become infructuous.
The 1st defendant claimed damage of Rs.1,00,000/-. When the suit was filed,
the patent was registered and therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiff
cannot be said to be malicious or abuse of process of court. Therefore, the
counter claim of damages cannot be granted to the first defendant. The issues
are answered accordingly.
25\. In the result, this civil suit suit and as well as the counter claim are
dismissed. No costs.

2\. The case of the Plaintiff as set out in in the plaint is as follows:-
a. The plaintiff is the original inventor of the patent relating to
Disposable Armpit Perspiration Pad. The invention of such armpit
perspiration pad is comprising of a oval shaped perspiration observing
membrane mounted on a moisture proof bearer element. It is used to observe the
armpit perspiration and at the the same time, to reduce the damage to the
garment. The plaintiff obtained Patent Registration No.181248 dated 21.5.1993
and the same is periodically renewed. The invention made by the plaintiff is
very unique and no one in the world has invented the same or similar product.
b. The plaintiff has been approaching the various institutions and industries
and other Government Departments to establish a factory to manufacture the
device. Coming to know about the unique invention and its use, the first
defendant has commenced manufacturing identically similar perspiration pads
under the trade mark SWEATEX at China and commenced the sale in India. The
product and the trade mark is a virtual copy of the plaintiff's registered
patent. The second defendant is a seller of the offending product in the city
of Chennai. The plaintiff, issued a notice dated 14.7.2005 to stop production
wordings. Therefore, there is nothing new in the plaintiff's patent. The ARUNA
JAGADEESAN, J.
Srcm Plaintiff was merely camouflaging a product whose discovery was known
throughout the World and trying to enfold it in their specification. In any
event, the period of patent is also already over and the claim of the
plaintiff becomes infructuous. In so far as rendering of accounts is are
concerned, in view of the conclusions arrived at above, the plaintiff cannot
claim any proprietary over the defendant's product and consequently, the
rendition of accounts cannot be granted.
24\. In so far as the counter claims are concerned, though the plaintiff's
patent is liable to be revoked due to lapse of time it has become infructuous.
The 1st defendant claimed damage of Rs.1,00,000/-. When the suit was filed,
the patent was registered and therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiff
cannot be said to be malicious or abuse of process of court. Therefore, the
counter claim of damages cannot be granted to the first defendant. The issues
are answered accordingly.
