the territorial jurisdiction. In view of the peculiar facts of the present
case wherein the plaintiff has alleged that the termination letter has been
issued during the judicial proceedings pending in the High Court of Madras
coupled with the fact that the interim order to stay the termination letter
has been continued for the last more than 2 years, the interim order passed on
18th November, 2013 will continue for further period of four weeks. The
Transferee Court would be at liberty to consider the matter and pass the order
whether to continue or not the interim order as per the merit of the case. The
           CORAM:
           HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MANMOHAN SINGH
    MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
1\. The plaintiff has filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction.
2\. The plaintiff is, inter alia, engaged in the business of running,
operating and maintaining 20 FM Radio Broadcasting stations at the following
places in India i.e. Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Chennai
Ahmedabad, Pune, Nagpur, Jaipur, Surat, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Sangli,
Vishakhapatnam, Coimbatore, Akola, CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 1 of 57 Solapur,
Vadodara and Nanded. The plaintiff is seeking a decree of declaration that the
Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013 sent by the defendant No. 2 which
was as per the plaintiff received on 24th June, 2013 (the first working day of
receipt of the notice as the office of the plaintiff company was closed on
22nd June, 2013 being a Saturday) whereby defendant No. 2 had cancelled 20
Compulsory Licenses for Radio Broadcasting all dated 3rd September, 2010
issued in favour of the plaintiff pursuant to the order dated 25th August,
2010 of Copyright Board is null and void. The plaintiff also seeks a decree of
permanent injunction restraining the defendants from in any manner acting upon
the cancellation notice dated 21st June, 2013 and for permanent injunction
restraining the defendant No.2 from invoking and encashing the bank guarantees
issued by the plaintiff in compliance with the order dated 25th August, 2010
passed by the Copyright Board.
3\. The defendant No. 1 Bank has been arrayed in the suit, as it has furnished
the bank guarantees on the request of the plaintiff in favour of the defendant
No. 2 i.e. Phonographic Performances Limited (hereinafter referred to as "PPL"
or the "defendant No. 2"). Defendant No.2 is a copyright society registered
under Section 33 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the
'Act') and is engaged in carrying on the copyright business of its members in
sound recordings who administers the sound recordings of its members and
further claims to charge and collect license fees from the said users of sound
recordings.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 2 of 57
4\. It is alleged in the plaint that the impugned Cancellation Notice
interferes with due course of judicial proceedings pending in the High Court
of Madras and High Court of Judicature at Bombay and also obstructs the
administration of justice as the defendant No. 2 has no power or locus under
the Copyright Act, 1957 read with the Copyright Rules, 2013 to cancel the
compulsory licenses granted by the Copyright Board.
5\. The suit along with interim application was listed before the Court on
18th November, 2013 when summon and notice were issued. The interim order was
also passed against the defendant No.2 staying the operation of cancellation
notice dated 21st June, 2013 while passing the detailed order.
6\. The said order was challenged by the defendants in an appeal being FAO
(OS) 561/2013 before the Division Bench, wherein the major issue of
territorial jurisdiction of this Court was raised. The Division Bench observed
that as the question of territorial jurisdiction is yet to be decided by the
Single Judge, the Division Bench did not make any comments thereon and
directed the parties to await the final decision on the subject by the Single
Judge when the matter is taken up.
7\. Both the parties have made their submissions on merit as well as on the
question of territorial jurisdiction as the objection taken by the defendants.
They agree that if the issue of territorial jurisdiction is decided against
the plaintiff and in favour of defendant No.2, then there is no need to go
into the merit of the case.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 3 of 57
8\. It is necessary to refer the brief facts as mentioned in the plaint; the
same are stated as under:-
(a) In or about October, 1999, the Government of India opened FM Radio
Broadcasting, to private parties and issued tender documents to interested
parties under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885\. The objective of the
privatization of the FM Radio Broadcasting sector was to affect a rapid
increase in the broadcast network within the country.
(b) The defendant No. 2 came out with the alleged rates of royalty payable by
the FM radio broadcasters under the mandatory tariff scheme which any
copyright society had to publish, and had fixed the rate of royalty at Rs.
2,400 per needle hour or 20% of the net advertisement revenue, whichever was
higher. Aggrieved by this unilateral fixation of royalty, the plaintiff along
with other broadcasters filed three complaints under Section 31 (1) (b) of the
Copyright Act, 1957 before the Copyright Board in the year 2002 seeking
compulsory licenses to play the music owned by PPL and its members.
(c) The Copyright Board by its interim order dated 19th November, 2002 in the
compulsory licensing applications moved by different private FM broadcasters
(including the plaintiff) against defendant No. 2, to finally decide the final
rate of royalty/compensation payable to defendant No. 2, had fixed interim
rates of royalty at Rs.1,200/- per needle hour during prime time i.e. from 8
a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 4 of 57
which were to remain in operation for a period of two years i.e. 2002 to 2004.
A needle hour is internationally accepted as the term denoting the actual time
for which music is played during an hour excluding the advertisements,
promotional and the presentation time taken by the radio jockey. The Copyright
Board also fixed the rate at 60% of this standard rate for the normal 12 hours
i.e. from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 25% of
the standard rate for the eight lean night hours i.e. from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
as the royalty payable. The average royalty rate worked out to Rs. 660/- per
needle hour which was to come into effect from the 1st November, 2002 and to
remain in operation till 31st October, 2004.
(d) The plaintiff along with other broadcasters, as well as defendant No. 2
filed appeals and cross-appeals (in total nine appeals) before the High Court
of Bombay inter-alia assailing the order dated 19th November, 2002 passed by
the Copyright Board. The Bombay High Court by a common judgment and order
dated 13th April, 2004 in First Appeal Nos. 279-294 of 2003, 421 of 2003 and
1573 of 2003 reported as Phonographic Performance Ltd. v. Music Broadcast Pvt.
Ltd., 2004 (29) PTC 282 (Bom) set aside the order dated 19th November, 2002
and remitted the matters back to the Copyright Board for reconsideration and
for fixation of license fees.
(e) Thereafter, Special Leave Petitions were filed by the plaintiff and other
broadcasters, before the Supreme Court, whereby CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 5 of
57 the Supreme Court vide its common judgment dated 16 th May 2008 reported in
Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. v. Super Cassette Industries Ltd., reported
in (2008) 13 SCC 30 allowed the appeal of another broadcaster i.e.
Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. and simultaneously dismissed the Special
Leave Petition of the defendant No. 2 thereby upholding the decision of the
Bombay High Court. The Supreme Court, while concurring with the High Court of
Bombay and also remanded the said matter to the Copyright Board for fresh
consideration on merits.
(f) Pursuant to the order dated 16th May, 2008 passed by the Supreme Court,
six fresh applications/ complaints were filed in the year 2008 before the
Copyright Board under Section 31(1)(b) of the Copyright Act, 1957 by various
other broadcasters apart from the three applications/complaints that were
remanded by the Supreme Court.
(g) Thereafter, the trial before the Copyright Board commenced in July, 2008
and the examination of witnesses began on 28th July, 2009 and was followed up
through subsequent sittings ending on 12th July, 2010.
(h) The common order dated 25th August, 2010 was passed by the Copyright Board
in the various remanded matters as well as fresh filings done before the
Copyright Board. The Copyright Board, in exercise of powers conferred under
Section 31 (1) of the Copyright Act, 1957, directed the Registrar of
Copyrights to CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 6 of 57 grant complainants i.e. the
plaintiff separate licenses for communicating the work recorded in sound
recordings in the repertoire, present and future, of the defendant No. 2 to
the public, by broadcast on revenue sharing basis subject to certain terms and
conditions as stated herein below:-
> a. "2% of the net advertisement earnings of each FM radio station accruing

(i) Being aggrieved by the order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the
Copyright Board, the defendant No. 2 had preferred an appeal dated 28th
October, 2010 under Section 72 of the Copyright Act, 1957 before the High
Court of Judicature at Madras. The High Court of Judicature at Madras vide its
order dated 22nd December, 2010 in CMA No. 3382/2010 dismissed the application
for interim relief seeking stay of the order dated 25th August, 2010.
Thereafter the defendant No.2 filed a Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 5727-
5735/2011 before the Supreme Court inter alia assailing the order dated 22nd
December, 2010 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras. The Supreme
Court vide order dated 5th April, 2011 dismissed the Special Leave Petition.
(j) In pursuance of the order dated 25 th August, 2010 passed in Case No.1 of
2002 titled as 'Music Broadcast Private Limited v. Phonographic Performance
Limited' granted licenses to the plaintiff for communicating the work recorded
in sound recordings in the repertoire, present and future of the defendant No.
2 to the public by broadcast on revenue sharing basis subject to the terms and
conditions as adumbrated in the order dated 25 th August, 2010. These licenses
were granted for all the 20 radio channels of the CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 9
of 57 plaintiff on 3rd September, 2010 and are valid up to 30th September
2020, i.e. for about 10 years.
9\. The plaintiff accepted the Compulsory Licensing Order and never exercised
its right of appeal against it under Section 72(2) of the Copyright Act. The
said order, therefore, has attained finality qua the plaintiff. The defendant
No.2 was unable to obtain interim stay of the said Compulsory Licensing Order
in its pending appeal under Section 72(2) of the Copyright Act before the
Madras High Court and on further appeal from the Supreme Court.
10\. The defendant No. 2 filed a Writ Petition (Civil) No.8144 of 2011 titled
as 'PPL v. Union of India and others' before this Court wherein the plaintiff
was arrayed as respondent No.3. The relief sought in the said writ petition
was the quashing of the Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September 2010 granted
by the Registrar, Copyright Board. This Court by order dated 18th January,
2011 refused to grant any interim order in favour of defendant No. 2 who by
order dated 4th January, 2012 directed both the parties i.e. MBPL and PPL to
comply with the directions issued by the Division Bench in L.P.A No.
1037/2011. It is submitted by the plaintiff that said order dated 4th January,
2012 passed by the Single Judge of this Court was being complied.
11\. The defendant No. 2 also filed a Contempt Petition in the month of March,
2012 being Cont. Case No. 203/2012 in Writ Petition Civil No. 8144/2011 titled
as 'Phonographic Performance Limited v. Union of India and Others' inter alia
alleging non-compliance of the order CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 10 of 57 dated
4th January 2012 passed by this Court which mandated the compliance of the
order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board. The Contempt
Petition was subsequently dismissed as not pressed by the defendant No.2 and
order therein was passed on 19th February, 2013. The writ petition was
dismissed. The LPA filed against the judgment has also been dismissed as
informed by the parties.
12\. The plaintiff in response to the letters dated 13th January, 2011 and
19th January, 2011 addressed a letter dated 24th January, 2011 to the
defendant No. 2 wherein the plaintiff stated that it was complying and would
continue to comply with the final order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the
Copyright Board and the terms of the Compulsory Licenses granted in pursuance
thereto on 3 rd September, 2010. The compulsory licenses were valid and
subsisting till date. The tariffs in terms of the License Agreements were
broadly based on orders passed by Courts/Copyright Board and were subject to
adjustments as per the final order which would be passed by appropriate
Courts/Tribunal in due course. Therefore, the defendant No.2 says that
'unilateral adjustment' is not correct. The plaintiff reiterated that an
amount of Rs.3,80,00,000/- which was deposited as security deposit in terms of
the License Agreement was liable to be refunded and requested the defendant
No. 2 to inspect the logs at a mutually convenient time and pointed out that
it had been making the logs available throughout the CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page
11 of 57 decade of its relationship with the defendant No. 2 by letter dated
14th February, 2011.
In order to adjust the excess amount in terms of Clause 6, 7 and 8 of the
Voluntary License Agreements, the plaintiff in view of order dated 25th August
2010 passed by the Copyright Board, filed a suit being Suit No. 565/2011, in
the month of February, 2011 before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay
titled as 'Music Broadcast Private Limited v. Phonographic Performance
Limited' inter-alia praying that the defendant No. 2 be restrained from
terminating the Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September, 2010 unless the
excess amounts paid by the plaintiff has been adjusted and exhausted fully.
The High Court of Judicature at Bombay by order dated 9th February 2011 had
recorded that the defendant No. 2 would not terminate the voluntary licence
agreements entered with the plaintiff. The said interim order remained
operative till the filing of the present suit.
13\. The defendant No. 2 sent a letter dated 17th June, 2013 in response to
the letters dated 7th March, 2013, 5th April, 2013, 7th May, 2013 and 7th
June, 2013 sent by the plaintiff whereby the defendant No. 2 averred that the
plaintiff was not complying with the terms and conditions as envisaged in the
order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board. The adjustments
made by the plaintiff were unilateral and without any legal foundation. It was
further alleged that the plaintiff was in default of Para 30.27 (b) of the
order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board. The defendant No.
2 CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 12 of 57 had also alleged that the plaintiff had
failed to keep the Bank Guarantees alive and subsisting even for a brief
period.
14\. The plaintiff replied to the letters dated 17th June, 2013 vide separate
letters dated 28th June, 2013 specifically denying the contents thereof. The
plaintiff stated that that it has been regularly revising the bank guarantee
within two weeks of the close of every quarter of the year which rendered the
contention of non-compliance of the order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by
the Copyright Board as nugatory and otiose. The plaintiff by its letter dated
January, 2013 bearing Reference Number BG/12/Mumbai/010 forwarded an extension
of the Original Bank Guarantee issued by Axis Bank bearing number
00040100005214 dated 12th January, 2011. This extension of the Original Bank
Guarantee remained valid till 31st March, 2013. Thereafter, the plaintiff's
bankers namely Axis Bank by their Registered Notice dated 3rd April, 2013
notified the defendant No. 2 about the cancellation of the Original Bank
Guarantee which expired on 31st March, 2013. Pursuant to the letter dated 3rd
April, 2013, Axis Bank on instructions from the plaintiff Company had revised
the Original Bank Guarantee bearing number 00040100005214 dated 12th January,
2011 with effect from 1st April, 2013 to 30th June, 2013. Therefore, the Bank
Guarantee was extended by the plaintiff's bankers with effect from 1st April,
2013 and not 6th April, 2013 as falsely contended. Thereafter, in due
compliance of the order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board;
the plaintiff vide letter dated 12th April, 2013 bearing Reference No.
BG/12/Mumbai/011 (within two weeks of the close, of CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page
13 of 57 the quarter ending 31st March, 2013 i.e. before 15th April, 2013)
forwarded the extension of the Original Bank Guarantee.
15\. On merit, it is alleged by the plaintiff that in compliance with the
order dated 25th August, 2010 and the compulsory licenses granted by the
Copyright Board the amount due from the plaintiff to the defendant No. 2 had
to be adjusted against the excess payment of license fee. The computation of
the same was also sent along with letter dated 5th October, 2010. The
defendant No. 2 had in fact, without demur and protest had been accepting the
said adjustments till the letters dated January 13th January 2011 and 19th
January 2011 were written whereby for the first time the defendant No.2 raised
a grievance about the said adjustments but the same was not acceptable to the
plaintiff. The plaintiff by various letters including 8th September 2010,
complied with the terms of the order of the Copyright Board dated 25th August,
2010 including enclosing bank guarantees of Rs.10,000/- for the respective
radio stations (aggregating to Rs. 2,00,000/-). But the defendant No. 2
initially refused to accept the service of the said Bank Guarantees however
thereafter has accepted the same. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the
defendant No. 2 in violation of the order dated 25th August, 2010 failed to
return the said bank guarantees after its expiry and it was only returned
pursuant to the order dated 9th February, 2011 passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Bombay in Civil Suit No. 565 of 2011\. Prior to the date of said
order, the defendant No. 2 sent a letter dated 13th January, 2011 to the
plaintiff wherein the defendant No. 2 invoked clause 10 of the License
Agreements and called upon the CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 14 of 57 plaintiff to
provide the defendant No. 2 an inspection of the copies of the records of the
sound recordings used by the plaintiff within 15 days from the date of receipt
of the said notice and another letter dated 19th January 2011, to the
plaintiff stating that the plaintiff had failed to pay any license fee for the
period February, 2010 to August, 2010 and the outstanding license fees was to
the tune of nearly Rs.2 crores, the adjustment of royalty could not be done
unilaterally any adjustment sought to be made by the plaintiff was incorrect
as it had preferred an appeal being CMA No. 3382/2010 assailing the order
dated 25th August 2010 passed by the Copyright Board before the High Court of
Judicature at Madras. Written statement (defence)
16\. Written statement has been filed by the defendant No.2 who is the main
contesting party in the suit and has raised various preliminary objections
inter-alia stating that the present suit is an abuse of process whereby the
plaintiff, having failed to obtain any relief on the same cause of action in
the Court within whose jurisdiction the entire purported cause of action
arose, being the Bombay High Court, which was also the Court of exclusive
jurisdiction by express agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant
No.2, has attempted to recycle the same cause of action by clever verbal
jugglery in order to obtain relief in this Court which does not enjoy
territorial jurisdiction in the matter.
17\. The case of the defendant No.2 is that the present suit is an abuse of
process of the court as the plaintiff in its own suit No.565/2011 which was
pending in the Bombay High Court, the CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 15 of 57
plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendant No.2 from terminating
the voluntary licence agreements (VLAs) and the compulsory licenses, but it
could not obtain an order restraining defendant No.2 from cancelling the
compulsory licenses. The plaintiff is now doing forum shopping, seeking to
obtain orders from this Court that the plaintiff could not obtain on the same
cause of action in the Bombay High Court.
18\. It is stated that the plaintiff's entire cause of action is its claim,
based on its own interpretation of the VLAs, of a purported right to adjust
alleged overpayments made by the plaintiff under the VLAs against the
Compulsory Licence compensation fixed by the Copyright Board in the order
dated 25th August, 2010. The main lis between the parties comprises the
plaintiff's interpretation of Clause 8 of each of the VLAs (a mixed question
of fact and law) and the plaintiff's averments regarding the quantum of dues
payable to defendant No. 2 under the VLAs. The dispute thus arises out of the
VLAs. No fresh cause of action has been shown to exist or to have arisen
independent of the VLA to enable the plaintiff to file this suit in Delhi. The
said dispute could have been easily denied by the Bombay High Court.
Therefore, the defendant No.2 has rightly challenged the question of
territorial jurisdiction as it is settled law that each and every fact pleaded
by a plaintiff does not give rise to a cause of action; rather the facts
constituting the cause of action are only those having a nexus or relevance to
the lis. Before exercising jurisdiction, the Court must be satisfied that all
relevant facts which have a substantial nexus with the lis are located within
its territorial CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 16 of 57 jurisdiction. The plaint
must be read in a meaningful manner to find out the intention behind the suit.
A mere insertion of extraneous matter in the present suit cannot change the
substance of its cause of action. The only lis in the matter relates to the
alleged rights arising out of VLA, and the same is subject to exclusive
jurisdiction of Courts in Mumbai.
19\. It is alleged by the defendant No.2 that admittedly on 25th August, 2010
the Copyright Board issued an order allowing the complaint filed by the
plaintiff in 2002 and directed the Registrar of Copyrights to issue Compulsory
Licenses to the plaintiff on the terms set out in the order itself. On 3rd
September, 2010 the Registrar of Copyrights issued 20 compulsory licences on
the same terms. The relevant condition of licence for the purposes of the
present suit is clause (f) which reads: "In case payment is not made by the
Licensee for consecutive two months PPL herein shall be entitled to cancel the
licence by giving notice of one month and recover the remaining dues from the
bank guarantee".
20\. It was alleged that it was obligatory on the part of the plaintiff to
comply with the terms of the compulsory licenses subject to which they were
allowed to broadcast the repertoire of sound recording works administered by
the defendant No.2. But the plaintiff admittedly never made any payment of
compulsory licence compensation but, instead, raised a claim under the
Voluntary Licence Agreements for adjustment of alleged excess payments made
under the said VLAs against the compensation payable to the plaintiff under
the terms of compulsory licence.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 17 of 57
21\. It is also submitted that the plaintiff has dishonestly suppressed the
fact that the Cancellation notice took effect from 21st July, 2013. The
plaintiff had made the same false averment in para 5 of its WP(C) No.
4533/2013 filed before this Court on 24th July, 2013 when the matter came up
for hearing. On the said date, as recorded by the Court there was no time left
for hearing, hence a temporary injunction was granted until the next date of
hearing. The plaintiff thus obtained the said interim order whilst failing to
disclose that the impugned cancellation notice had already taken effect, in
order to obtain an order restoring the status quo ante rather than one merely
maintaining the status quo.
22\. The reliance on the VLAs is misplaced since the plaintiff itself had
abandoned them from February, 2010 onwards by committing willful breaches of
their essential terms, in particular by ceasing to pay any licence fee or
submitting any logs of usage of the plaintiff's repertoire. The plaintiff has
admitted the same in its replication however as an afterthought and in an
attempt to cover up its breaches had stated that: "The plaintiff herein out of
sheer inadvertence could not pay the royalty for a brief period of February
2010 to September, 2010." It is thus admitted that the plaintiff had abandoned
the VLAs long before the Compulsory Licensing Order. The plaintiff's claim for
an injunction based on the same agreements which the plaintiff itself has not
performed is unlawful and without merit.
23\. It is alleged by the defendant No.2 that the plaintiff deliberately is
misinterpreting Clause 8 of the VLAs inspite of its clear language.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 18 of 57
(i) The VLAs were not ad hoc or transitional agreements that were executed
merely in relation to the expected orders of the Copyright Board. Rather, the
VLAs were free standing negotiated agreements which merely took into
consideration contingencies that might possibly arise during the terms of the
different VLAs. The term of each VLA was only 12 months and defendant No. 2
was entirely at liberty to renew them or not.
(ii) It is the Licensor who is authorized to adjust the license fee payable
under the VLA's and not the Licensee.
(iii) The plaintiff deducted IDS both from the payments made originally under
the VLAs and again from the payments shown as compulsory licence compensation.
This is an admission by the plaintiff that the two were separately payable.
24\. On merit, defendant No.2 has submitted that the plaintiff's claim under
VLAs not based on final order. The adjustment referred to in para 3 of Clause
8 of the VLA's arises only on "the final orders are passed in the pending
proceedings". The clause does not refer to the orders to be passed by the
Copyright Board but to the "final Orders". The Copyright Board's orders are
appealable under Section 72 of the Copyright Act. An appeal is pending before
the Madras High Court. Either party if aggrieved by the appellate order would
have a further remedy before the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the
Constitution. There can be no question of the parties making any adjustment
under para 3 of Clause 8 of the VLAs. The plaintiff was bound to make payments
to defendant No. 2 as required by the Compulsory Licensing order dated 25th
August, 2010. As the plaintiff CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 19 of 57 failed to do
so, it has to face the consequences envisaged in clause
(f) of the said order.
25\. Defendant No.2 submits that the plaintiff's claim of the purported
adjustments under the VLAs is admittedly pending in the Bombay High Court in
Suit No.565/2011. The Bombay High Court has admittedly not granted any interim
relief qua the termination of the Compulsory Licenses/adjustments.
26\. As per defendant No.2 the outstanding as on 31st July, 2014 on account of
compulsory licence compensation due from the plaintiff is Rs.9,71,89,343/-
which includes the interest on outstanding from the plaintiff. The ad-interim
order has also prevented defendant No.2 from encashing the Bank Guarantees
which are unconditional which otherwise it is entitled to do. The amount
secured under the Bank Guarantee is Rs.41,97,987/-. Even if the Bank
Guarantees are allowed to be encashed the loss caused to defendant No.2 could
only be offset marginally.
The licenses granted by the Central Government to the plaintiff for operating
FM radio stations is only ten years and all licenses/permissions are due to
expire in 2016. It will be impossible for defendant No.2 to recover the
outstanding amount from the plaintiff thereafter if the plaintiff closes down
its only business.
27\. The Voluntary License Agreements discloses that "In case the rates are
reduced by the final order then the Licensor shall adjust the difference from
further usages by the Licensee." Further, in terms of Clause 8 of the
Voluntary License Agreement the only 'pending proceeding' at the time of
entering the Voluntary License Agreement CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 20 of 57
were the proceedings before the Copyright Board. The issue of adjustments
being done by the plaintiff is already pending before the High Court of
Judicature at Bombay in Civil Suit No. 565/2011 titled as 'Music Broadcast
Private Limited v. Phonographic Performance Limited'.
28\. Thus, the balance of convenience entirely favours defendant No. 2. There
can be no balance of convenience in favour of a party which has not come to
Court with clean hands. The plaintiff is in material breach of the essential
terms of the VLAs which they base upon their purported claim and the same are
in infringement of copyright as well as of the essential terms of the
Compulsory Licenses. Secondly, the retroactive nature of the interim
injunction in force deprives defendant No. 2 of its legitimate remedies for
infringement by the plaintiff after cancellation of the compulsory licenses.
Further, continuance of the interim order affects defendant No. 2's business
rather than the plaintiffs. And finally any interim order in favour of the
plaintiff in the present suit pre-judges defendant No. 2's pending WP(C) No.
8144 of 2011 wherein, if defendant No. 2 succeeds, die plaintiff will be
entitled only to five compulsory licences, yet will have obtained additional
benefit of fifteen such licences to which it is not entitled.
29\. With regard to the other submission that the plaintiff failed to submit
every month for each of its stations, complete and necessary declarations
regarding its net advertising earnings and pro-rata distribution, the
plaintiff has denied the same. It is alleged that the plaintiff is not obliged
under the said order dated 25th August, 2010 CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 21 of 57
Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September, 2010 to submit, every month for each
of its stations, complete and necessary declarations regarding the net
advertising earnings and pro-rata distribution. Further, the defendant No.2 in
the impugned notice has for the first time raised the said issue as a ground
for cancellation of the Compulsory Licenses. The defendant No.2 has since
September, 2010 admittedly never raised the issue of lack of complete and
necessary declarations regarding net advertising earnings and pro- rata
distribution as a ground for Cancellation of Compulsory Licenses.
30\. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the defendant No.2 in the impugned
notice has raised the alleged issue of submission of log reports as a ground
for cancellation of the compulsory licenses. The defendant No.2 has since
September, 2010 admittedly never raised the issue of lack of submission of
monthly usage log reports as a ground for Cancellation of Compulsory Licenses.
It is specifically denied that the plaintiff has failed and neglected to
submit monthly usage log reports. It is submitted that the plaintiff vide
their letters dated 24th January, 2011 and 14th February, 2011 addressed to
the defendant No.2 indicated that the logs were available at its office and
the same may be inspected by a prior written notice. In fact, the same were
enclosed vide letter dated 14th February, 2011 by way of abundant caution for
its records as it chose not to inspect the same by visiting the office.
31\. In the reply to the other allegation that the plaintiff has not reported
its net advertisement revenue for the month of January, CS(OS) No.2119/2013
Page 22 of 57 2012 for its FM Radio Station located in the city of Ahmedabad,
the plaintiff has denied the same. The plaintiff has also referred its letter
dated 6th February 2012, whereby it has forwarded its net advertisement
revenue for the month of January 2012 for its FM radio station located in the
city of Ahmedabad. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the alleged grievance
is only an afterthought and has been raised more than one year after the
alleged default. The alleged grievance of the defendant No.2 was communicated
to the plaintiff only by way of the Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013.
The defendant No.2 had never in any of its prior correspondence sought to
terminate the Compulsory Licenses on the basis of the said grievance.
32\. The other contention of the defendant No.2 is that the plaintiff has been
making defaults in providing Bank Guarantees as per clause (b) of the
compulsory license read with para 30.27(b) of the Copyright Board's order.
However, it is submitted that it has been regularly revising the Bank
Guarantee within two weeks of the close of every quarter of the year which
renders the contention of non- compliance of Para 30.27 (b) of the order dated
25th August, 2010, passed by the Copyright Board as erroneous. The plaintiff
vide its letter dated 11th January, 2013 bearing Reference Number
BG/12/Mumbai/010, forwarded an extension of the Original Bank Guarantee issued
by defendant No.1 bearing number 00040100005214 dated 12th January,2011. This
extension of the Original Bank Guarantee remained valid till 31st March, 2013.
Thereafter, the plaintiff's bankers namely defendant No.1 by their CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 23 of 57 Registered Notice dated 3rd April, 2013 notified
the defendant No.2 about the cancellation of the Original Bank Guarantee which
expired on 31st Match, 2013. Pursuant to the letter dated 3rd April, 2013
defendant No.1 on instructions from the plaintiff have revised the Original
Bank Guarantee bearing number 00040100005214 dated 12th January, 2011 with
effect from 1st April, 2013 to 30th June,2013. Therefore, the Bank Guarantee
was extended by the plaintiff's bankers with effect from 1st April, 2013 and
not 6th April, 2013 as falsely contended. Thereafter, in due compliance of the
order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board, the plaintiff has
vide letter dated 12th April, 2013 bearing Reference No. BG/12/Mumbai/011
within two weeks of the close of the quarter ending 3rd March, 2013 (i.e.
before 15th April, 2013) forwarded the extension of the Original Bank
Guarantee. The said Bank Guarantees have been regularly revised/extended by
the plaintiff till date in terms of the Compulsory License(s).
33\. In rejoinder arguments, it is also submitted that the impugned
cancellation notice is a ploy to circumvent the order dated 25th August, 2010
by the Copyright Board which has been upheld by various courts including the
Supreme Court, as the defendant No.2 had assailed the said order before
various Courts. Firstly the defendant No. 2 had preferred an appeal dated 28th
October, 2010 under Section 72 of the Copyright Act, 1957 before the High
Court of Judicature at Madras. The said Court by its order dated 22nd
December, 2010 in CMA No. 3382/2010 dismissed the application for interim
relief, seeking stay of the order dated 25th August 2010. The CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 24 of 57 above said order dated 22nd December, 2010 was
challenged before Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.
5727-5735/2011 which was also dismissed by order dated 5th April, 2011.
34\. As the defendant No.2 has failed to get the orders of stay of operation
of the order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board, the
defendant No. 2 by instituting a Writ Petition (Civil) No.8144 of 2011 titled
as 'PPL v. Union of India and others' before this Court wherein the plaintiff
was also arrayed as respondent 3rd No.3, sought quashing of the Compulsory
Licenses dated September, 2010 granted by the Registrar of the Copyright
Board. This Court vide order dated 18th November, 2011 refused to grant any
interim order in favour of defendant No. 2. The Division Bench of this 4th
Court vide order dated January 2012 directed both the parties i.e. plaintiff
and defendant No.2 to comply with the directions issued by the Division Bench
in LP.A No.1037/2011. It is submitted that the 4th plaintiff continues to
comply with the order dated January, 2012 passed by the Single Judge of this
Court.
This Court vide order dated 9th January, 2015 dismissed the W.P. (C) No. 8144
of 2011.The defendant No. 2 thereafter in a ploy to circumvent the order dated
25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board filed a Contempt Petition in
the month of March, 2012 being Cont. Cas No. 203/2012 in the above said writ
petition Civil No. 8144/2011 ,inter alia, alleging non-compliance of the order
dated 4th January 2012 passed by this Court which mandated the compliance of
the order dated 25th August 2010 passed by the CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 25 of
57 Copyright Board. The petition was subsequently dismissed as not pressed, by
this Court by its order dated 19th February, 2013.
35\. The plaintiff admits that it had earlier filed a Writ Petition being W.P.
(Civil) No. 4533 of 2013 inter-alia seeking a writ of certiorari for quashing
the impugned notice dated 21st June, 2013. The plaintiff herein vide order
dated 29th October, 2013 withdrew the Writ Petition with the liberty to
agitate its grievance before a Civil Court.
36\. It is also pointed out by the plaintiff that the defendant No.2 by
relying upon the Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013 filed a suit for
infringement being Suit (Stamp) No. 626 of 2013 against the plaintiff filed a
suit for infringement. Till date, the defendant No.2 has not been granted any
relief in the said suit.
It is also stated that the plaintiff has received the Cancellation Notice
dated 21st June, 2013 on 24th June, 2013. In fact, the plaintiff received this
notice on 22nd June, 2013 as averred in the written statement of defendant No.
2 and proved by the Speed Post and courier delivery reports filed by defendant
No. 2 at pp. 54 and 55 of its documents. In its replication the plaintiff has
not denied and hence admitted the said delivery on 22nd June, 2013.
37\. In view of rival submissions made by the parties and various documents
referred by the parties, let me first deal with the issue of territorial
jurisdiction. It is settled law that once the Court holds that it has no
jurisdiction in the matter, it should not consider the merits of the matter.
Reliance is placed on Jagraj Singh v. Birpal Kaur, (2007) 2 SCC 564 (para 27).
Thus, as agreed by the parties also let me first deal with the issue of
territorial jurisdiction.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 26 of 57
38\. On the issue of territorial jurisdiction arising from the location of a
subordinate office, Mr. Amit Sibal, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf
of the defendant No.2 has referred the judgment of Patel Roadways Ltd. v
Prasad Trading Co. AIR 1992 SC 1514 (paras 9-12) in which it has been
explained the true import of Section 20(a) and the explanation to Section 20
CPC. The Supreme Court interpreted the explanation to Section 20 as an
Explanation to Section 20(a), and the law is settled that a suit can be filed
at a place where the branch/subordinate office of the defendant is located
only if a part of cause of action has arisen at that place and not otherwise.
This Court relied upon Patel Roadways (supra) in Anant Raj Industries Ltd v.
Balmer Lawrie Co. Ltd., (2003)103 DLT 169, (para 10) and held as under:
> "10...........When this decision is applied to the facts of the present
> case, it will appear that it may have been proper for the Plaintiff to file
> a suit in Calcutta where the principal office of the Defendant is located.
> It could also have been filed in Delhi where a subordinate office is
> located, provided the cause of action of which the Plaintiff is aggrieved,
> has had arisen in Delhi. In am of the view that despite the fact that the
> contract might have been entered into at Delhi and money is paid in Delhi,
> the cause of action on which the suit is predicated was unrelated to the
> agreement................... On an application of the ratio of Patel
> Roadways, there is no scope for Delhi Court to exercise jurisdiction."
> Please also see Kensoft Infotech Ltd. vs. Mr. R.S. Krishnaswami & Ors., ILR
> (2007) I Delhi 308 at para 61-62, pp 339-340."
39\. It is submitted by the defendant No.2 that the contents of present plaint
are similar as that of the plaint in Suit No. 565 of 2011 CS(OS) No.2119/2013
Page 27 of 57 filed by the plaintiff in the Bombay High Court and the cause of
action is also similar viz. the plaintiff's claim under the Voluntary Licence
Agreements. Thus, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present
suit. The plaint is liable to be returned to the plaintiff for presentation
before the proper Court under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.
It is argued by Mr. Amit Sibal, learned Senior Counsel that each and every
fact pleaded by the plaintiff does not give rise to a cause of action creating
territorial jurisdiction, rather the intention of the suit as a whole has to
be considered, trivial aspects of the stated cause of action with no nexus to
the lis between parties do not confer territorial jurisdiction. The facts
constituting the "cause of action" are only those having a substantial nexus
or relevance to the lis. Before exercising jurisdiction, the Court must be
satisfied that all such facts arise within its territorial jurisdiction. The
cause of action consists of bundle of facts which give cause to enforce the
legal injury for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is those facts,
which if taken with the law applicable to them, gives the plaintiff a right to
claim against the defendant. The facts pleaded must be material, integral or
essential to the lis between the parties which must be determined on a
meaningful reading of the plaint.
40\. Mr. Sibal has argued that the plaintiff has erroneously relied upon a
suit filed by defendant No. 2 as plaintiff in this Court in Phonographic
Performance Limited v Spring Club, 2014(209) DLT 584 to argue that defendant
No. 2 itself avers that it has a branch office in Delhi from which it carries
out the business of licensing of sound recordings. The said case is irrelevant
for CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 28 of 57 determining whether "cause of action"
has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court in the facts of
the present case. In Phonographic Performance Limited (supra), defendant No. 2
had filed a suit for infringement of its copyright in sound recordings and
averred that it has a branch office in Delhi from which it carries out the
business of licensing sound recordings to maintain a suit as a plaintiff under
Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act. Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act reads
as under:
> "For the purpose of sub-section (1), a "district court having jurisdiction"
> shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,
> 1908 (5 of 1908), or any other law for the time being in force, include a
> district court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of
> the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the
> suit or other proceeding or, where there are more than one such persons, any
> of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or
> personally works for gain."
Under Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act, it is not a sine qua non, for a
copyright owner to maintain a suit for infringement, that the cause of action
should arise at the place of suing. The situation is wholly different from
Section 20(a) CPC read with the Explanation, which mandates that the 'cause of
action' must have arisen at the place of a subordinate office of the defendant
to create territorial jurisdiction at such place. The fact that defendant No.
2 has an office in Delhi and does licensing of sound recordings from such
office does not give rise to any cause of action as it is immaterial to the
lis between the parties in this suit, which relates to the entitlement of the
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 29 of 57 plaintiff to adjust the alleged excess
payments made under VLAs.
It is submitted that mere location of a branch office of PPL in Delhi and the
licensing of sound recordings from such office does not clothe this Court with
territorial jurisdiction as no "cause of action" has arisen within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
41\. It is relevant to mention here that after the order in the interim
application was reserved on 10th August, 2015 and before pronouncement of the
order, the plaintiff filed fresh application being I.A. No.20535/2015 under
Section 151 CPC for placing on record certain further development and
additional documents. The said applications were listed before Court on 29th
September, 2015. The defendant No.2 sought time to file the reply. After
filing the reply on 8th January, 2016, it was observed and agreed by the
parties that the averments made in the application are linked with the interim
injunction application thus the same be decided along with I.A. No.1762/2013.
42\. It was alleged in the application that on 14th September, 2015 pending
motion being No.654/2015 was taken by the Bombay High Court in C.S (O.S)
565/2011 and the same was disposed of after recording the statement on behalf
of the plaintiff that the plaintiff has adjusted the amount permitted by the
Copyright Board under the compulsory licenses in respect of voluntary licenses
and no further amount remains to be adjusted. Counsel for defendant No.2
raised its objection that the adjustment was impermissible and Court had
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 30 of 57 observed that the objections be kept open to
the final hearing of the suit, however the pending motion was disposed of.
43\. It is evident from the said order that the issue of adjustment of the
amount is kept alive which is to be decided at the final stage. The said
amount is pertaining to voluntary licenses and the plaintiff has exercised its
power to adjust the amount suo-motto in view of the clause 8 of the agreement.
44\. Mr. Sibal has rightly argued that once the advantage has been taken by
the plaintiff in clause 8 of the agreement, the clause 33 of the said
agreement ipso facto would be attracted.
45\. The plaintiff has invoked the territorial jurisdiction of this Court to
entertain the present suit on the grounds that the defendant No.2 carries on
business within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court at Delhi. The
defendant No.2 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8144/2011 filed by it before this
Court inter-alia seeking cancellation of 15 Compulsory Licenses granted by the
Registrar of Copyrights has admitted in Writ Petition that the defendant
No.2(petitioner therein) is carrying on business from its office in Delhi. The
defendant No.2 in the said Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8144/2011 describing the
jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the Writ Petition stated that the
plaintiff (arrayed as respondent No.3 in the Writ Petition) is broadcasting
the sound recordings of the defendant No.2 (petitioner in the writ petition)
from one of its FM Radio Stations located at Delhi.
Writ petition (Civil) No.8144/2011 preferred by the defendant No.2 (Petitioner
therein) has been dismissed vide judgment dated 9th January, 2015.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 31 of 57
46\. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the defendant No.2 has also filed a
Civil Suit being CS (OS) No. 2749/2011 before this Court titled as
'Phonographic Performance Limited v. HT. Media', which also pertains to the
order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the Copyright Board wherein it has
been stated that PPL is carrying its business of compulsory licensing from
Delhi. The reliance is also placed on the order dated 18th November, 2013
passed by this Court in the present suit wherein this Court rejected the
contention of the defendant No.2 qua the lack of territorial jurisdiction of
this Court. Paragraph 14 of the impugned order is reproduced herein below:-
> "Admittedly, the defendant's subsidiary office is at Delhi, part of cause of
> action has arisen at Delhi as the Compulsory Licenses were issued at Delhi,
> the breach whereof is alleged by the defendant and the right to cancel
> conferred on the plaintiff arises from the Compulsory Licenses issued at
> Delhi. Thus, it cannot be said that this Court has no territorial
> jurisdiction to try the present suit. It is further the contention of the
> defendant that since the plaintiff is relying upon voluntary agreements, as
> per Clause 33 of the voluntary license agreement the parties agreed to
> submit to the jurisdiction of High Court of Judicature at Bombay exclusively
> and thus this Court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain
> the suit. In the present suit, the cause of action does not arise because of
> voluntary license agreement between the parties but relates to the
> Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013 issued by the defendant citing.
> breaches of the Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September, 2010, Hence the
> terms of the Voluntary License Agreements between the parties will not
> govern the present suit."
47\. The contention of the defendant No.2 is that the suit could have only
been filed in Bombay High Court and not in Delhi, if any fresh CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 32 of 57 cause of action has arisen. The filing of suit
before this Court is an abuse of process of Court.
48\. Mr. Sibal, learned Senior counsel contends that the presence in Delhi of
one out of twenty of the plaintiff's radio stations has no substantial nexus
or relevance to the lis. If the plaintiff could sue in any one of twenty
places at its choice without the cause of action arising at the place where a
radio station of the plaintiff is located. The averments in the plaint in the
context of territorial jurisdiction of this Court are not integral, material
and essential to the lis between the parties.
49\. In any case, even assuming arguendo as argued by Mr. Sibal that part of
cause of action has arisen both in Mumbai and Delhi, the exclusive
jurisdiction clause in the VLAs cannot be derogated from and operates as a
jurisdictional bar on this Court.
50\. There are following admitted facts and circumstances which may be
relevant for the purpose of deciding the issue of territorial jurisdiction as
per the pleadings. The same are as under:-
a) All VLA's are made and executed at Mumbai. Clause 33 of each VLA is an
exclusive jurisdiction clause of the Bombay High Court. Therefore, any dispute
arising out of the VLAs has to be decided by the Bombay High Court. Such suit
has already been filed by the plaintiff (Suit No.565/2011) before the Bombay
High Court.
b) Both the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 have their registered offices in
Mumbai. The plaintiff's various letters addressed to the defendant No.2
containing their alleged claim of CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 33 of 57 adjustment
were sent by the plaintiff from their Mumbai office to the defendant No.2's
Mumbai office.
c) Defendant No.1 (registered office is in Ahmedabad) issued the relevant bank
guarantees from its Mumbai office and received instructions from defendant No.
2 invoking the same in its Mumbai office.
d) Defendant No. 2' s cancellation notice dated 21st June, 2013 is addressed
and issued from the Registered office of the defendant No.2 in Mumbai and
addressed to and received by the plaintiff at its registered office situated
in Mumbai.
e) All other relevant correspondence between the parties also admittedly took
place in Mumbai. In paragraph 11 of the plaint the plaintiff states that its
cause of action arose from a series of acts of defendant No. 2 which took
place only in Mumbai.
51\. The cause of action to file the present suit arose on 21st June, 2013
when the defendant No. 2 issued the Cancellation Notice terminating the
Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September, 2010. Admittedly, the said
cancellation notice was issued and received in Mumbai. The cause of action
also arose on 22nd July, 2013 when the defendant No. 2 sought to invoke the
Bank Guarantees in question by addressing a letter to the defendant No.1,
admittedly this happened in Mumbai.
As per the plaintiff, the cause of action arose on 23 rd July, 2013 when the
defendant No.2 filed the Suit (Stamp) No. 626 of 2013 CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page
34 of 57 [now numbered as Suit No. 796 of 2013] inter-alia on the alleged plea
of infringement by the plaintiff of the repertoire of the defendant No. 2. The
said suit was admittedly filed in the Bombay High Court. Even in para 12 and
13 of Suit No.565/2011 filed by the plaintiff in the Bombay High Court, the
plaintiff has itself averred that the cause of action regarding its claim of
adjustment between the VLAs and the apprehension that the Compulsory licenses
will be terminated by the defendant No.2 arose in Mumbai and accordingly
claimed the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court.
52\. The plaintiff claimed jurisdiction in Delhi on the basis that defendant
No. 2 has a branch office in Delhi, that the plaintiff has 1 out of 20 FM
Radio Stations in Delhi, that the Copyright Board and the Registrar of
Copyrights have respectively passed the Compulsory Licensing Order and issued
the Compulsory Licenses from their offices in Delhi after proceedings
conducted in Delhi is without any substance as none of these facts has any
bearing on the plaintiff's actual cause of action. As per settled law that
each and every fact pleaded by the plaintiff does not ipso facto give rise to
a cause of action creating territorial jurisdiction, rather the intention of
the suit as a whole has to be considered, trivial aspects of the cause of
action do not confer territorial jurisdiction.
The argument of the plaintiff is that the claim of territorial jurisdiction in
Delhi on the basis that the Copyright Board's order was passed in Delhi is
irrelevant, since the plaintiff has not disputed the said order and in any
case because the geographical location of a CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 35 of 57
tribunal is no basis for claiming territorial jurisdiction. Further, in A.B.C
Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies, 1989 (2) SCC 163 Supreme Court held that
in cases of repudiation of contract, the jurisdiction will lie with Courts
where the said repudiation was received.
53\. Even some part of the cause of action arose in Delhi, the most essential
and inseparable part of the plaintiff's cause of action indisputably rests on
the plaintiff's above claims made on the basis of the VLAs. No event occurring
in Delhi can derogate from the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the VLAs. This
Court cannot dispose of the lis between the parties de hors the plaintiff's
purported claim of adjustment under the VLAs against compulsory license
compensation. Even assuming arguendo that this Court has territorial
jurisdiction on the basis of any other elements of the cause of action, the
jurisdiction of this Court remains barred by the exclusive jurisdiction clause
in the VLAs. Reliance is placed on the following:  Begum Sahiba Sultan v
Nawab Mohd. Mansur Ali (2007) 4 SCC 343 (para 10).
 M/s Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. v M/s Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd. (2004) 4 SCC
671 (para 7).
54\. The plaintiff has now averred that this Court has territorial
jurisdiction as the plaintiff is operating one of their FM Radio Stations in
Delhi. It is pertinent to note that the Compulsory Licenses or the Copyright
Board's order is not under challenge in the present suit so as to confer
territorial jurisdiction to this Court. The plaintiff is claiming compliance
of the terms of the Compulsory Licenses by letter written CS(OS) No.2119/2013
Page 36 of 57 from its registered office in Mumbai to the defendant No.2 who
also has its registered office in Mumbai. The plaintiff is submitting the
usage reports (although incomplete and unsubstantiated) for all its 20 FM
Radio stations from the registered office in Mumbai to the defendant No.2's
registered office in Mumbai.
The plaintiff has addressed all its correspondence after the Copyright Board's
order dated 25th August, 2010 referred to and relied upon in the present suit
from their registered office in Mumbai. The plaintiffs have addressed all
their letters claiming purported adjustments from their registered office in
Mumbai to the defendant's registered office in Mumbai.
55\. The Supreme Court in Union of India v. Adani Exports Ltd., (2002) 1 SCC
567 held as under:
> "17........ It is clear from the above judgment that each and every fact
> pleaded by the respondents in their application does not ipso facto lead to
> the conclusion that those facts give rise to a cause of action within the
> courts territorial jurisdiction unless those facts pleaded are such which
> have a nexus or relevance with the lis that is involved in the case. Facts
> which have no bearing with the lis or the dispute involved in the case, do
> not give rise to a cause of action so as to confer territorial jurisdiction
> on the court concerned...." (Emphasis supplied)
56\. Another decision of the Supreme Court in Alchemist Ltd & Anr. v State
Bank of Sikkim & Ors. (2007) 11 SCC 335, has been relied upon by the defendant
No.2, in which after discussing a catena of judgments, it was held as under:
"25.The learned counsel for the respondents referred to several decisions of
this Court and submitted that whether a particular CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 37
of 57 fact constitutes a cause of action or not must be decided on the basis
of the facts and circumstances of each case. In our judgment, the test is
whether a particular fact(s) is (are) of substance and can be said to be
material, integral or essential part of the lis between the parties. If it is,
it forms a part of cause of action. If it is not, it does not form a part of
cause of action. It is also well settled that in determining the question, the
substance of the matter and not the form thereof has to be considered."
57\. Reliance is also placed on the following judgments in this regard. South
East Asia Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Nav Bharat Enterprises Pvt Ltd & Ors., (1996) 3
SCC 443, (para 3); Kensoft Infotech Ltd. v. R.S. Krishnaswami & Ors. ILR
(2007) I Delhi 308, (para 61); Rattan Singh Associates (P) Ltd. v. M/s Gill
Power Generation Company Pvt. Ltd., ILR (2007) I Delhi 275 (paras 12, 18, 21,
22 and 31); Sector twenty-one Owners Welfare Association v Air Force Naval
Housing Board & Ors., (1997) 65 DLT 81 (DB) (para 13.)
58\. Admittedly, correspondences were exchanged between the parties in regard
to the above from Mumbai i.e. from their offices. As a matter of fact the
plaintiff itself has based its suit filed before the Bombay High Court on its
repudiation of the defendant No.2 by letter dated 19th January, 2011 refusing
to accept the purported adjustments sought to be made by the plaintiff.
59\. The plaintiff admittedly instituted Suit No. 565 of 2011 in the Bombay
High Court, seeking enforcement of its claim under the VLAs abandoned by them
for adjustment of alleged excess payment thereunder against the compensation
payable to the defendant No.2 CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 38 of 57 for compulsory
licence, and seeking permanent and interim injunctions restraining the
defendant No.2 from cancelling the compulsory licences for non payment of
compensation. Prayers (b) and (e) in the said suit are reproduced below:-
"(b) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to declare that the Defendant is bound
to adjust and the plaintiff is not liable to pay any usage amount under the
License Agreements and the Compulsory License Agreements dated 3rd September,
2010 until such time as the excess amount computed in terms of prayer (a)
above to the extent of Rs.8,83,06,248/- or such sum that may remain after
adjustment of amounts against future usage has been adjusted and exhausted
fully...
(e) That the Court be pleased to pass a permanent order and injunction
restraining the Defendant, its officers, servants. directors, employees,
authorized representatives and agents or any one from in any manner
terminating or taking any coercive steps under the License Agreements and the
Compulsory License Agreements dated 3rd September 2010 as long as (i) the
excess amount is lying with the defendants and (ii) the monthly payments are
made by the plaintiff in consonance with the order dated 25th August 2010
passed by the Copyright Board;
60\. It is evident that the plaintiff's claim for enforcement of its
interpretation of the VLAs and the same plaintiff's claim to be complying with
the terms of the compulsory licences, are not merely indissolubly interlinked
but in fact are one and the same plea as well as one and the same cause of
action.
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 39 of 57
61\. In the plaint in Suit No. 565 of 2011 filed by the plaintiff before the
Bombay High Court set out the cause of action and the territorial jurisdiction
for the said suit. The plaintiff has averred that the cause of action is the
defendant No.2's letter dated 19th January, 2011. Further for territorial
jurisdiction the plaintiffs have averred that all the VLA's are executed at
Mumbai and the plaintiffs and the defendant No.2 have their registered offices
(principle places of business) in Mumbai. The plaintiff carries on its
business within the jurisdiction of the Mumbai High Court and therefore under
Section 62 of the Copyright Act (which vests jurisdiction in case of suits
under chapter XI of the Copyright Act to the District Court having
jurisdiction). Section 62 (2) contains exclusive interpretation of the terms
'District Court having jurisdiction appearing in sub section (1) of Section
62'. It specifies the district court within whose jurisdiction the person
instituting the suit actually and voluntarily reside or carry on business. The
cause of action to file the suit in Mumbai and a fresh cause of action is
sought to be made out by the plaintiff in the present suit. The subject matter
of the Bombay suit is the 20 VLA's and the 20 Compulsory Licenses. The
plaintiff has averred jurisdiction of Mumbai High Court (exclusive under
Section 62) with respect to all the compulsory licenses pleading that it is
carrying on business in Mumbai.
62\. Thus, it appears to the Court very clearly that the lis between the
parties arises entirely out of the VLAs. Both in the Bombay suit and in the
present suit, the plaintiff is seeking to enforce its claims under the VLAs
with a consequential injunction against cancellation (whether prospective or
post facto) of its compulsory licences for non-
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 40 of 57
payment. These are not two lis, which might be adjudicated separately but only
one, and there is no cause of action de hors the same.
63\. No doubt after the Copyright Board's order dated 25th August, 2010 (also
referred to as "Compulsory Licensing Order"), claiming the right to adjust
under Clause 8 of the VLA's, the plaintiff sent notices to defendant No. 2
stating that it need not make payments under the compulsory licenses until
alleged excess payments made under the VLAs are adjusted. Defendant No. 2 did
not accept the said claim for adjustment.
64\. Accordingly, defendant No. 2, by exercising its right under clause (f) of
the compulsory licenses and Para 32.27(f) of Compulsory Licensing Order sent a
notice of cancellation for 20 compulsory licenses to the plaintiff, which was
served on 22nd June, 2013, and took effect on 21st July, 2013. In the present
suit (as in the Bombay suit) the plaintiff assails defendant No. 2's right to
cancel the licenses on the basis of its claim to adjust under VLAs.
65\. The defendant No. 2 had issued the Cancellation Notice inter- alia on
various grounds such as alleged non-payment of compensation by 7th day of each
month on and from October, 2010 or any other date, for all the FM Radio
Stations till date; alleged failure to submit monthly usage log reports;
defaults in providing Bank Guarantees as per clause (b) of the Compulsory
Licenses read with Para 30.27 (b) of the Copyright Board's order dated 25th
August, 2010 etc. which are not the subject matter of the suit filed before
the High Court of Bombay. The suit filed before the High Court of CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 41 of 57 Bombay seeks to restrain the defendant No. 2 from
terminating the Compulsory Licenses dated 3rd September, 2010 as long as the
excess amount is lying with the defendant No. 2 and the monthly payments are
made in consonance with the order dated 25th August, 2010 passed by the
Copyright Board. However, in the Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013,
the defendant No. 2 has sought to terminate the Compulsory Licenses on various
other false and baseless grounds as detailed in the Cancellation Notice which
constitute a fresh cause of action.
66\. It is also the admitted position that the plaintiff in Bombay suit sought
injunction restraining the defendant No.2 from terminating VLA's and
compulsory licenses who could not get the injunction from cancelling the
compulsory licenses. When the present suit was filed the suit in Bombay High
Court was pending.
The case of the plaintiff is that the present suit arises out of a fresh cause
of action that has arisen on 21st June, 2013 when the defendant No. 2 had
issued the impugned Cancellation Notice dated 21st June, 2013 cancelling the
Compulsory Licenses granted by the Registrar, Copyright Board. The cause of
action also arose on 22nd July, 2013 when the defendant No. 2 sought to invoke
the Bank Guarantees by addressing letter to the defendant No.1.
67\. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that all the said VLAs have expired and
therefore the exclusive jurisdiction clause cannot be enforced. The plaintiff
cannot claim rights arising from the contract de hors the contract. If
according to the plaintiff, Clause 33 cannot survive on the expiry of the
agreement, then neither can the other CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 42 of 57
clauses. In that case the plaint is without any basis or cause of action,
because the entire plea of right to adjust is based on Clause 8 of the VLAs.
Moreover, this argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff contradicts the
plaint, which asserts rights based on Clause 8 of VLA in which case other
clauses also survive, including Clause 33 which bars the jurisdiction of this
Court. If the plaintiff argues that there cannot be any reliance on the
exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in Clause 33 of VLAs since they have
expired, the same rationale will also be extended to the entire VLA, including
Clause 8.
68\. The contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the exclusive
jurisdiction clause is not enforceable after expiry of an agreement is
contrary to law and without any valid reason. The judgment of National Textile
Corpn Ltd v. Ashval Vaderaa, 2009(107) DRJ 637, relied upon by the plaintiff,
does not support his proposition, as it is inapplicable to the facts of the
present case and completely distinguishable. In National Textile Corpn. Ltd.
(supra), the rights of the petitioner neither flowed from the agreement dated
16th October, 1978 that had expired in 1980 (more than 25 years earlier) nor
related to that period. During those 25 years, the expired agreement was
succeeded by agreements whose terms kept on changing from time to time. A new
month to month tenancy was in existence from 1st January, 2005 (with no
arbitration clause) when the landlord filed a suit for possession in 2006.
Thereafter in 2006/2007, the petitioner-tenant filed an application invoking
the arbitration clause of the expired/exhausted 1978 agreement with which the
controversy had no relation, and no rights from the earlier expired CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 43 of 57 agreement or for that period were in question. It
is in this context that this Court held that that a party cannot resort to an
arbitration clause in the exhausted/expired contract as the disputes were
covered by a new contract, which had no arbitration clause.
69\. This issue is no longer res integra as this Court, on facts and subject
matter similar to the present suit, has held that an ouster clause (exclusive
jurisdiction clause) will continue to be applicable for interpretation of the
rights of the parties flowing from an agreement even after its tenure has come
to an end. Reliance is placed on Nariman Films v. Dilip Mehta & Anr., 2005(31)
PTC 571 (Del.), (para 19-21).
70\. Once the advantage has been taken by the plaintiff in clause 8 of the
agreement and the similar relief has also been sought by the plaintiff earlier
in Bombay High Court then the clause 33 of the said agreement ipso facto would
be attracted. Both clauses 8 and 33 of the agreement are reproduced herein
below:-
> "8. The Licensor hereby grants voluntary license for the existing and future
> works of Licensor's members upon following terms and conditions :
              As per the standard terms and conditions of the
               voluntary    license,   the    licensee,   before     the
> commencement of the broadcast was required to pay an advance payment of
> Rs.30,00,000/- (Rs. Thirty Lacs only) per station as an interest free
> security deposit. However as the Licensee has commenced six stations and is
> obtaining voluntary License for Mumbai station, the Licensor as a special
> consideration agrees to Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lacs only) as interest
> free security deposit. The deposit amount shall be paid back to the Licensee
> subject to deduction of dues if any, CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 44 of 57 in
> case the radio stations is closed or if the License is cancelled/terminated.
>  The Licensee before the commencement of the broadcast to make an adhoc
> advance payment of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rs. Three Lacs only). This amount shall be
> adjusted at the end of the month as per the following royalty rate :
> o Rs.1200/- per needle hour during 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. & 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. o
> Rs.300/- per needle hour during 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and o Rs.720 per needle
> hour during rest of the day.  The licensee do hereby agree to pay arrears,
> if any, from the date of commencement of broadcast to Licensor in accordance
> with the final orders that may be passed in the pending proceedings. In case
> the rates are reduced by the final order then the Licensor shall adjust the
> difference from further usage by the Licensee. It is further agreed declared
> and confirmed that the rate of license fee payable by the Licensee to the
> Licensor under this agreement shall not be construed as a discount or rebate
> or concession granted by the Licensor to the Licensee and that the rate of
> Licensee fee shall be such as may be finally determined for Licensees
> operating at the city of operation by the Hon'ble Court and/or Tribunal. The
> Licence Fee is exclusive of any Sales Tax, Service Tax, Lease Tax and/or
> other such taxes as may be levied on the Licence Fee payable, by any
> government authority and regulations. All taxes, duties or other similar
> payments (including VAT) shall be borne by the Licensee.
> 33\. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
> laws of India and the High Court of Judicature at Bombay shall have
> exclusives jurisdiction."
71\. The plaintiff has admitted that the amount has been adjusted in view of
the order passed by the Copyright Board under Clause 8 of CS(OS) No.2119/2013
Page 45 of 57 the VLA's. In view of admission, clause 33 of the same very
VLA's would also get attracted wherein it has been stipulated that High Court
of judicature at Bombay shall have exclusive jurisdiction.
72\. On a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is clear that the entire lis
between the parties is covered by Clause 33 of the VLAs. The plaintiff claims
that the cancellation of compulsory licence is invalid because the plaintiff
is entitled to adjust the amounts payable under the compulsory license from
the amount already paid under VLAs, which is subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction clause. An exclusive jurisdictional clause cannot be allowed to
be circumvented by clever verbal jugglery and recycled cause of action (from
C.S. No. 565 of 2011 in Bombay High Court) in order to obtain relief from this
Court that it could not get from the Bombay High Court. It is settled law that
even where courts in two places may have jurisdiction, an exclusive
jurisdiction clause in favour of one of the two places ousts the jurisdiction
of the other. Reliance is placed on Swastik Gases Pvt. Ltd. v Indian Oil
Corporation Ltd. (2013) 9 SCC 32, (paras 31-33); ABC Laminart Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) (paras 12, 15, 16 & 18); M/s Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. (supra). Since
this suit seeks adjudication on rights of the plaintiff to adjust allegedly
excess payments under VLAs, Clause 33 of VLA operates as a jurisdictional bar
on all other courts other than the Bombay High Court, including this Court.
73\. In view of the admitted facts referred above and as per clause 33, this
Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present suit as per following
judgments :
CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 46 of 57
> (i) Balaji Coke Industry Private Limited v. Maa Bhagwati Coke Gujarat
> Private Limited, (2009) 9 SCC 403, (paras 24 to 30), which read as under:-
> "24. The only question which falls for our consideration is whether,

> subject to Kolkata jurisdiction, it would be open to the respondent Company
> to contend that since a part of the cause of action purportedly arose within
> the jurisdiction of the Bhavnagar Court, the application filed under Section
> 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, before the Principal Civil

> that of this Court in Hakam Singh [(1971) 1 SCC 286 : AIR 1971 SC 740].
> 26\. Faced with the question as to whether an agreement arrived at between

> from such agreement would not be contrary to public policy and would not,
> therefore, be contrary to the provisions of Section 28 of the Contract Act,
> 1872.
> 27\. The said question once again arose in A.B.C. Laminart (P) Ltd. [(1989)
> 2 SCC 163], wherein following the decision in Hakam Singh, but relying on
> the maxim ex dolo malo non oritur actio, this Court held that by an

> which would otherwise have the jurisdiction to decide the cause of action
> under the law, it could not be said that the parties had by their contract

> 29\. The question also arose in R.S.D.V. Finance Co. (P) Ltd. v. Shree
> Vallabh Glass Works CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 48 of 57 Ltd. [(1993) 2 SCC

> 18\. Jurisdiction CS(OS) No.2119/2013 Page 50 of 57 The agreement shall be

> 9\. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that even

> 1) Whether the Court below has jurisdiction to entertain the present

> 2) Whether the Court below is justified in going into the merits of the

> petition?
> 18\. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that even a fraction of
> cause of action is enough and sufficient to decide the territorial
> jurisdiction of a Court for entertaining the petition under Section 9 of the
> Act. According to him, the registered office of the appellant company is
> situated at Hyderabad, the tender documents under Ex.A11 have been submitted

> bank guarantees have been drawn at the banks at Hyderabad, and thus cause of
> action having arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court below, in view of
> the provisions of Section 20 C.P.C., the Court below had the jurisdiction to

> 31\. In the case on hand, as noted supra, the parties have specifically, in

The plaint therefore is liable to be returned under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC for
presentation before the appropriate Court i.e. High Court of CS(OS)
No.2119/2013 Page 56 of 57 Judicature at Bombay who is only competent to have
the territorial jurisdiction. In view of the peculiar facts of the present
case wherein the plaintiff has alleged that the termination letter has been
issued during the judicial proceedings pending in the High Court of Madras
coupled with the fact that the interim order to stay the termination letter
has been continued for the last more than 2 years, the interim order passed on
18th November, 2013 will continue for further period of four weeks. The
Transferee Court would be at liberty to consider the matter and pass the order
whether to continue or not the interim order as per the merit of the case. The
Registry would return the plaint along with all the pleadings of the parties
and documents to the plaintiff through counsel, against receipt as per
procedure.
