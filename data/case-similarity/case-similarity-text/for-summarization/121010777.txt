Madras High Court
O.A.Nos.917 And 918 Of 2 vs Rickyy Bahl" To Any Person
     O.A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2011
    in C.S.No.756 of 2011
    VINOD K. SHARMA,J.
The plaintiff / applicant has filed O.A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2011, under Order
39 Rule 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure r/w Order XIV, Rule 8 of the
Original Side Rules, praying therein as under:
i) O.A.No.917 of 2011 - To grant interim injunction restraining the
respondents 2 to 5 from releasing the release prints of the file "LADIES V/S
RICKYY BAHL" to any person.
ii) O.A.No.918 of 2011  To grant interim injunction, restraining the
respondents, agents, servants, representatives or any other persons acting on
their behalf in any manner infringing the exclusive copy rights of "Nan Avan
Illai" in Tamil and "WOH MAIN NAHI" in Hindi.
2\. The plaintiff / applicant is a renowned producer and distributor, having
name and fame in film industry and has produced many cinematographic films and
also a distributor of films. The plaintiff produced a Tamil feature film
titled "Nan Avan Illai", after securing the rights from the creator and
producer Mr.K.Balachander and Dr.Kamala Selvaraj under the agreement dated
pleaded or proved. In this case, admittedly besides similarities, there is
also material and broad dissimilarities, which prima facie shows that there is
no infringement of copy right, therefore, suit filed by the applicant /
plaintiff prima facie does not show infringement of copy right.
31\. Consequently, no other conclusion than the one that the applicant /
plaintiff has failed to make out prima facie case, can be arrived at. The
applicant / plaintiff, in the event of success finally, can always claim
damages, therefore, the balance of convenience is certainly in favour of the
defendants / non applicants, as he has already produced the film and is ready
for release.
32\. For the reasons stated above, finding no merits in these applications,
O.A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2011 are ordered to be dismissed, but with no order as
to costs.
33\. However, it is made clear that anything stated herein above be not taken
it to be final expression on merit of controversy in this case. It will be
open to the parties to lead evidence in support of their respective stand, at
producer Mr.K.Balachander and Dr.Kamala Selvaraj under the agreement dated
30.11.2006 and released the film in Tamil on 20.04.2007, starring Jeevan,
Nameetha, Malavika, Sneha, Keerthi Chawla, Jothimayi, which was directed by
Selva. The film proved to be a super-duper hit.
3\. It is the case of the plaintiff / applicant that in order to remake the
above said film in Hindi version, the plaintiff also purchased the original
rights of the film "WOH MAIN NAHI" vide agreement dated 03.01.2008. The
plaintiff, thus, is copy right owner of film "Nan Avan Illai" in Tamil and
"WOH MAIN NAHI" in Hindi. The plaintiff, after securing the above said copy
right, issued a public notice in the leading magazine to bring to the notice
of the general public that the plaintiff was the absolute copy right holder of
film "Nan Avan Illai" in Tamil and "WOH MAIN NAHI" in Hindi.
4\. The further case of the plaintiff is that he was shocked and surprised to
see the promos in TV and advertisement of the defendants' forth coming film
"LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL". The case of the plaintiff is that the very promos
itself reveals that the said film is nothing but a remake of the plaintiff's
film "Nan Avan Illai" in Tamil and "WOH MAIN NAHI" in Hindi. "LADIES V/S RICKY
BAHL". It is pleaded case of the plaintiff that it has been reliably learnt
that the story pattern, sequences, narration and other incidents are similar
to the plaintiff's copy right version films and that the defendants were
attempting to release the film "LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL" on 09.12.2011 to get
unjust enrichment, which will cause heavy loss to the plaintiff and would
amount to infringement of the copy right.
5\. It is also the case of the applicant / plaintiff that a legal notice was
issued on 16.11.2011, to which a reply has been received. On the pleadings
referred to above, the plaintiff / applicant seeks prayers reproduced herein
above.
6\. The defendants have filed counter raising objection that the suit is not
maintainable, as the suit for copy right infringement can only be maintained
upon showing of actual infringement and not on the basis of conjectures and
surmises. The stand in the counter is that the suit does not disclose any
cause of action and the suit has been filed on the basis of promos of the film
to come to the conclusion that the film is based on the plaintiff's film. It
is the case pleaded in the counter that the does not disclose what copy right
protection have been infringed.
7\. It is also the stand of the respondents that under Section 14(d) of the
Copyright Act, 1957, the exclusive rights vested in the owner of a
cinematographic film are;
i)to make a copy of the film, including a photograph of any image forming part
thereof,
ii)to sell or give on hire, or offer for sale or hire, any copy of the film,
regardless of whether such copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier
occasions; and
iii)to communicate the film to the public.
8\. The stand of the defendants is that the plaintiff / applicant does not
allege violation of any of the above said right. In the pleadings, reliance is
placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Star
India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Leo Burnett (India) Pvt. Ltd., (2003) 2 BCR 655, wherein
it has been held that infringement of a cinematographic film per se reproduced
such as is the case with video / CD/ cable piracy etc. Thus, there is no prima
facie case of infringement, which may entitle the plaintiff to interim
injunction.
9\. It is the case of the defendants that the assignment deed relied upon by
the plaintiff is confined to the remake and dubbing rights in languages Tamil,
Telugu and Kannada, which does not give right in Hindi. Whereas assignment
deed dated 03.01.2008 shows that the plaintiff has been given right to remake
/ reproduce the film one time in Hindi, therefore, it is not open to the
plaintiff to claim that he is the absolute copyright owner of the film "WOH
MAIN NAHI". It is further stated in the counter by placing reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.G.Anand vs. M/s.Delux
Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613, that there can be no copyright in an idea, subject
matter, themes, plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the
copyright in such case is confined to the form, manner and arrangment and
expression of idea, by the author of copyrighted work, therefore, plaintiff
cannot claim copyright over story matter of the films.
10\. On merit, the stand of the defendants / non applicants is that the film
"LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL" is an entirely distinct film from "Nan Avan Illai"
with significant distinction in themes between the two films:
"Naan Avan Illai"
"Ladies vs. RICKY Bahl"
The lead male character marries 4 different women and leaves them thereafter.
The lead male character does not play the love or marriage game and all the
cons are planned depending upon the person.
The core of the film is the courtroom drama where the main male lead character
is caught and is presented in front of the women he has married.
There is no court room drama and the lead male character does not get caught.
The cops catch the main lead in the very beginning of the movie and then the
women characters are called in to identify him.
There is no such scene.
The women don't know each other and only meet at the hospital for
identification purposes. The women never voluntarily search for the male
character.
The women somehow get in touch with each other, and devise a way to find the
male character and con him instead of handing him over to the police.
The lead male character is a romantic and the movie is primarily based on his
romantic trysts.
The lead character is a cold calculated con-man for WOHm the entire matter is
akin to a game and his primary objective is to make money.
The lead male character gets killed in the end.
The lead male character does not get killed in the end.
11\. It is pleaded case that in order to succeed, the plaintiff is required to
show that literary work alleged to have been infringed must have been
reproduced verbatim or substantially, resulting in an impression in the minds
of the viewers that the original and the reproduction are the same. It is also
pleaded case that there is no averment that any actual copy right or script of
the original Tamil film has been copied. It is also stand of the defendants /
non applicants that the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of various material
facts and that the plaintiff's film "Nan Avan Illai" as well as the earlier
film "Nan Avan Illai (1974)" are based on a Marathi play titled "Toh Mee
Navhech" authored by Acharya Prahlad Keshav Atre, therefore, in absence of
plaintiff, showing how the makers of the original film had obtained from
Acharya Prahlad Keshav Atre in the literary work being script of the play
titled "Toh Mee Nahvech" and the present suit is not maintainable.
12\. That in fact the Marathi play itself, it was based on a real life
incident involving a person named Madhav Kazi, a handsome youth, who had duped
several girls from wealthy families with promises of marriage and in fact
married seven of them under different names and guises, who was finally
arrested and tried in Court. It is pleaded in the counter that the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Jagmohan
Mundhra, AIR 1985 Bom.229, was pleased to hold that there cannot be any
copyright in an event which has actually taken place, therefore, the relief
claimed is against well settled principles of law.
13\. It is also pleaded case of the defendants that the plaintiff in the garb
of suit for copyright is claiming the absolute monopoly over any story line
where a main cheats one or more women using his charm, which is a common
enough them and there cannot be any copyright protection over its theme.
Reliance of this pleading is placed on the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of R.G.Anand vs. M/s.Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613 and also judgment of this
Court in Chatrapathy Shanmugham vs. S.Rangarajan, S.A.No.114 of 2004, decided
on 28.09.2011, laying down that there is no copyright protection for themes,
plots and story lines. The protection is only for the expression and this is
in copyright theory known as the idea-expression dichotomy. It was due to this
reason that on the same story line, number of films / plays has been made in
several languages.
14\. That a case of infringement cannot be made out unless upon showing of
substantial similarity between the original work and the allegedly infringing
work. The plaintiff has failed to show any such similarity. It is also pleaded
that contrary to popular notion, the art of writing a script is highly
structured with emphasis on a few key points. As a thumb rule, in the initial
portions of the script will be found the HOOK, being that part of the script
that grabs the attention of the viewer and pull him into the film. This is
followed by the "MINI CRISIS" and leading into the "DILEMMA". DILEMMA is
followed by the REACTION to the DILEMMA, then the "FIRST REVERSAL", at which
point the characters are drawn deeper into the DILEMMA, the "TENT POLE" where
passive characters become active or vice versa, the "SECOND REVERSAL" where it
is reaffirmed as to what the story is all about, and finally the LOW POINT OF
ACTION, being the place from where the main character has to rise up. Even to
arrive at a finding of prima facie infringement, an expert comparison between
the script of the original work and the script of the allegedly infringing
work is a prerequisite. If there are considerable dissimilarities between each
of these ingredients as found in the original, and the allegedly infringing
work, then there is no question of infringement even on a prima facie basis.
This also explains why it is imperative that the plaintiff should have filed
before this Hon'ble Court the script of its Tamil film "Naan Avan Illai" and
the Hindi film "Woh Main Nahi". The plaintiff is disentitled from demanding
that the defendant may preview its film without the plaintiff first coming out
clean with the script of its film. The nuances of the plaintiff's script are
absolutely essential when undertaking a comparison between the two works.
15\. The plea is that the contention raised includes serious complicated
question of fact, which can be gone into at the time of trial and not at the
stage of interim injunction. It is also the stand in the counter that
underlying them of the film "LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL" is the original idea
conceptualized by Mr.Aditya Chopra, who is a story and script writer of this
film, which is an independent creation, thus, it is pleaded that there is no
prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff / applicant. Reliance is placed on
the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Biswaroop Roy
Choudhary vs. Karan Johan, 2006 (33) PTC 381, holding therein that when the
defendant has completed the production of the film and is ready to release it
for commercial exploitation is a factor, which would always deter the Court
from granting injuctory relief.
16\. That defendant no.1 has invested Rs.28 Crores in making and marketing the
film and various third party rights, including satellite, extra-terrestrial
rights, overseas theatrical rights, VCD / DVD rights have been created and in
case any injunction is granted, it would cause irreparable loss to the
defendants. It is also the case that no evidence has been led to show the
attempts made by the plaintiff to remake the film in Hindi. On facts, the
averments made in the plaint are denied.
17\. The basic stand is that there is no violation of copyright and that there
is no similarities between two movies. It is also case that there is no
violation of copyright in the cinematographic film under Section 14(d) r/w
Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957, being not a remake. Thus, it is
asserted in the counter that the plaintiff has neither prima facie case nor
balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff.
18\. However, nothing has been shown that any irreparable loss would be caused
to the plaintiff / applicant. In order to determine the similarities between
the films, six Advocates were appointed to see both films, i.e. "Naan Avan
Illai" and "LADIES V/S RICKY BAHL" to file their report. It is surprising that
the set of Advocates nominated by the plaintiff reported in favour of the
plaintiff. Whereas the Advocates nominated by the plaintiffs reported against
the stand taken by the plaintiff.
19\. The report filed by M/s.Sandeep Bagmar, M.V.Swaroop & Ananth Padmanabhan,
Advocates, shows the following comparison between the two films:
"III. Comparison between the two films:
3.1There are considerable and material differences between various aspects of
the two films such as the characterisation of the hero, the development of the
plot, the narrative technique, all the other characters and their
characterisation, the lines in the films, the genre itself, the motive and
purpose of the hero's actions, the delving into the background / past of the
hero, and the overall treatment.
3.2The major points of comparison, thus highlighting the differences between
these films, are given in the form of a table below:
"Naan Avan Illai"
"Ladies vs Ricky Bahl The crux of this film revolves around denial of his
identity by one man The crux of this film revolves around a con man who never
denies his identity but gets a kick out of continuing the con act. In fact, he
even confesses in a particular scene that he is a con man, and has a ring back
tone that suggests this.
The core of the film is the courtroom drama where the main male lead character
is caught and is presented in front of the women he has married There is no
court room drama and the lead male character does not get caught.
The lead male character marries 4 different women and leaves them thereafter
The lead male character does not play the love or marriage game and all the
cons are planned depending upon the person. He never even abuses his women
physically, as is clearly mentioned by one of the three girls.
The film delves at length into the background of the lead male character as
the police investigation is closely interlinked with the courtroom drama.
The police is not ever in the picture in this film, and there is no delving at
all into the background of Ricky Bahl and what prompted him to resort to a
life of conning.
The lead male character is an anti-hero of sorts and there is no
transformation in his character till the very end.
The lead male character falls in love with Ishika the con woman and there is a
strong transformation in his character at the end.
The cops catch the main lead in the very beginning of the movie and then the
women characters are called in to identify him.
There is no such scene.
The women don't known each other and only meet at the hospital for
identification purposes. The women never voluntarily search for the male
character The women get in touch with each other, and devise a way to find the
male character and con him using the on woman instead of handing him over to
the police.
The lead male character is a romantic and the movie is primarily based on his
romantic trysts. This is also mentioned by some of the characters while
delving into his background.
The lead character is a cold calculated con-man for whom the entire matter is
akin to a game and his only objective is to make money. He never physically
desires his 'targets', as made clear by Dimple towards the end.
The hero's characterisation is very strong and none match up to him.
The heroine / con woman is shown as a strong character, especially towards the
end of the movie when the hero actually falls in love with her.
The lead male character gets killed in the end.
The lead male character does not get killed in the end.
The sequences where the hero cons each of the women whom he ultimately marries
are mentioned in detail above, and substantially differ from the conning
sequences in "Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl"
The sequences where the hero cons each of the women are mentioned in detail
above, and substantially differ from the ones in "Naan Avan Illai"
The narrative technique of this movie is guided entirely by the courtroom
drama, with the story emerging in flashback through the words of witnesses.
The narrative technique of this film is linear except for one small flashback
sequence, and as already mentioned above, this is no courtroom drama.
The characterisation of the hero in this movie is as a man with lot of vices
and yet a heart of gold. He is also shown to resort to might when required.
The characterisation of the hero in this movie is as a con man with no
physical desire for the women he cons, but he is not shown using might (no
action sequences at all in the film) or doing charitable activities.
The hero uses the assistance of a character named Napoleon to convince all the
women about his fake identity.
The hero does not use any such tactics except with the central character
herself, who anyways knows that he is a fraudster, and feigned trust in
Shankar in order to con him.
20\. Whereas the report filed by Mr.Mohammed Rafi, Mr.Remesh and Mr.Nazeer
Ahmed, Advocates, reads as under:
"(3) SIMILARITIES:
(1)In both the movies, the story line, plot and the main theme is that the
hero is a con man who cons may women and grabs money.
(2)The following 3 incidents are common in both the movies:
(a) Property deal: The Hero pretends to be a owner of the property and sell
the property, takes money and ran away by which deceives the heroine, which is
the main scene in both the movies namely Nan Avanillai and Ladies Vs. Ricky
Bahl.
(b) Painting: A very big episode of art gallery of Hussain. The names are
identical in both the movies with the regard to the painting work and the hero
cons one of the heroine by falsely declaring that he is a great painter and
sells away a duplicate painting and extract money which will prove to be a
duplicate at a later scene.
(c) Business: Common episode of business development screened in both the
movies that both of them becoming partner in opening business to con each
other which will be very pertinent in both the movies.
(3)In both the movies, the affected, disappointed and deceived heroines
jointly rebel against the con man hero and take revenge for his high
handedness.
(4)In both the movies, while tracing the whereabouts of the hero, who elopes
after coning, using the media net work, television and cell phones to locate
the identity, which is very common.
(5)In both the movies, one character helps the hero for coning all the ladies
namely Shankar in Ladies Vs. Ricky Bahl and comedian Mayilsamy in Nan
Avanillai.
(6)In both the movies, one of the victim of the coning shall develop love on
the hero.
(7)The hero's character and heroine' character are very same and similar with
the regard to the coning and taking revenge.
(8)The centre plot and character of the hero is a con man, cons may women and
grabs their money through various modus operandi, which is the core theme in
both the movies.
(9)In both the movies, the hero changed his name from character to character
and place to place, which is very common and identical.
(10)The film devolves at length in main character namely the hero cons all the
women by changing his name, religion and cheats.
(11)The lead role after coring everybody and after getting stabbed, transforms
himself and ask pardon from God in "Naan Avan Illai" whereas in Ladies Vs.
Ricky Bahl, the con man transforms himself and get married to one of the
heroines.
(12)In both the movies, the deceived women get together and wholeheartedly try
to take revenge on the corn hero.
(13)The hero and heroines character are very same and similar in both the
movies."
21\. Learned counsel for the applicant referred to the assignment agreement
dated 30.11.2006 with regard to Tamil, Telugu & Kannada Re-Make & Dubbing
Rights of "Naan Avan Illai". He also referred to the assignment deed with
regard to the film "Woh Main Nahi", to assert that the plaintiff has absolute
copyright to maintain the film. It was vehemently contended by the learned
counsel for the applicant that number of situations shown in the movies are
identical, which shows that the applicant is entitled to injunction prayed
for.
22\. In support of this contention, learned counsel for the applicant placed
reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.G.Anand
vs. M/s.Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
pleased to lay down as under:
"45. Thus, the position appears to be that an idea, principle, theme, or
subject matter or historical or legendary facts being common property cannot
be the subject matter of copyright of a particular person. It is always open
to any person to choose an idea as a subject matter and develop it in his own
manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently from others.
Where two writers write on the same subject similarities are bound to occur
because the central idea of both are the single but the similarities or
coincidences by themselves cannot lead to an irresistible inference of
plagiarism or piracy. Take for instance the great poet and dramatist
Shakespeare most of whose plays are based on Greek-Roman and British mythology
or legendary stories like Mer chant of Venice, Hamlet, Romeo Juliet, Jullius
Caesar etc. But the treatment of the subject by Shakespeare in each of his
dramas is so fresh, so different, so full of poetic exuberance. elegance and
erudition and so novel in character as a result of which the end product be
comes an original in itself. In fact, the power and passion of his expression,
the uniqueness, eloquence and excellence of his style and pathos and bathos of
the dramas become peculiar to Shakespeare and leaves precious little of the
original theme adopted by him. It will thus be preposterous to level a charge
of plagiarism against the great play-wright. In fact, thoughout his original
thinking, ability and incessant labour Shakespeare has converted an old idea
into a new one, so that each of the dramas constitutes a master-piece of
English literature. It has been rightly said that "every drama of Shakespeare
is an extended metaphor". Thus, the fundamental fact which has to be
determined where a charge of violation of the copyright is made by the.
plaintiff against the defendant is to determine whether or not the defendant
not only adopted the idea of the copyrighted work but has also adopted the
manner, arrangement, situation to situation, scene to scene with minor changes
or super additions or embellishment here and y there. Indeed, if on a perusal
of the copyrighted work the defendant's work appears to be a transparent
rephrasing; or a copy of a substantial and material part of the original, the
charge of plagiarism must stand proved. Care however must be taken to see
whether the defendant has merely disguised piracy or has actually reproduced
the original in a different form, different tone, different tenor so as to
infuse a new life into the idea of the copyrighted work adapted by him. In the
latter case there is no violation of the copyright.
23\. Reliance was also placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Rajasthan High
Court in the case of Fateh Singh Mehta vs. O.P.Singhal and others, AIR 1990
RAJASTHAN 8, wherein it has been laid down as under:
"The word "original" from S.13 does not mean that the work must be the
expression of original or invented thought. The originality in literary work
which is required by S.13 relates to the expression of thought. Much depends
on the skill, labour knowledge and the capacity to digest and utilise the raw
materials contributed by the others in imparting to the product the quality
and the character which those materials did not possess and which
differentiate the product from the materials used. The compiler of a work in
which absolute originality is of necessity excluded is entitled, without
exposing himself to a charge of piracy, to make use of preceding work upon the
subject, where he bestows such mental labour upon what he has taken, and
subjects it to such revision and correction as to produce an original result.
The question whether there has been an infringement of copy right depends on
whether colourable imitation has been made.
Where the thesis submitted by a teacher for obtaining Ph.D. Actually
reproduced verbatim some paras from the thesis for dissertation submitted by a
student who had obtained Master's degree on that dissertation and the said
teacher, applicant for Ph.D. was a guide for the student, the grant of
injunction by the Court passed in favour of the student who had obtained
Master's degree, against the University from conferring Ph.D. on his guide on
the basis of said thesis would be justified. Injunction was provided as one of
the remedies under the Act for any infringement of copyright. Moreover, there
was report of professor and Head of Department of Mechanical Engineering and
principal of College of Engineering stating that the said thesis contains
several reproductions from the thesis of the plaintiff student. In such a
case, mere resolution of the Research Board, Faculty of Engineering at its
meeting warning the applicant for Ph.D. for not making due acknowledgements in
his thesis of the material reproduced from the thesis of the plaintiff and
asking him to submit the revised copy of thesis indicating due acknowledgments
at proper places will not be material for the reason that no licence had been
granted u/S.30 of the Act by the owner of the copyright in favour of him nor
there was assignment copyright nor its relinquishment by the plaintiff. Case
law discussed."
24\. Reliance was also placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of The
Daily Calendar Supplying Bureau, Sivakasi vs. The United Concern, AIR 1967
MADRAS 381, wherein it has been laid down as under:
"For the purpose of infringement of copyright, an exact reproduction or copy
is not necessary. What is essential is to see whether there is reproduction of
substantial part of the picture. There can be no test to decide what a
substantial part of a picture is. As long as the mind is able to form on an
examination of the two pictures that basically and in substance one is a
reproduction of the other, further modifications or variations will not alter
the effect of infringement. There might be and there will be obvious
differences deliberately introduced to avoid a possible change of
infringement. A bad copy does not cease to be a copy. If the court, on a
consideration of all the relevant circumstances and a comparison of the
plaintiffs' picture and the infringing comes to the conclusion that the
defendants' picture was consciously copied from the work of the plaintiff,
that would be sufficient to hold that copyright is infringed.: 1895 AC 20 (25)
and AIR 1961 Mad 111 and AIR 1961 Mad 114 and (1848) 3 Story U.S.Rep.768,
Rel.on.'Law of Copyright' by Copinger, page 148, Ref."
25\. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicant / plaintiff was
that once concept is same, there are number scenes, which are similar. It is
proved that the applicant is having prima facie case, therefore, balance of
convenience is in favour of the applicant that he is likely to suffer
irreparable loss and injury if the injunction is not granted.
26\. Learned Senior Counsel for the defendants on the other hand vehemently
contended that the idea, if any, is driving from the Marathi drama "To Mee
Navhech", meaning "That's not me". The contention of the learned Senior
Counsel for the respondents was that this, having been based on the original
incident, cannot give any copyright to the applicant / plaintiff to claim any
copyright. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents also contended that the
situation in both cases are quite different and referred to the
dissimilarities, as pointed out in the counter as also the report of the
Advocate Commissioners, reproduced above.
27\. A strong reliance was placed by the learned Senior Counsel on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R.G.Anand vs. M/s.Delux
Films (supra), to contend that the allegations of the plaintiff do not make
out prima facie case. The contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the
respondents was that reading of the judgment shows similarities here or
similarities there is not sufficient to constitute violation of copyright
unless imitation made by defendants is substantial. That imitation will be a
copy which comes so near to the original as to suggest original to the mind of
every person seeing it. In other words, if after having seen the picture a
person forms a definite opinion and gets a dominant impression that it has
been based on or taken from the original play by the appellant that will be
sufficient to constitute a violation of the copy-right. That there is no prima
facie case, balance of convenience or irreparable loss to the plaintiff.
28\. On consideration, I find that the applicant has failed to make out a case
for grant of interim injunction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
R.G.Anand vs. M/s.Delux Films (supra), was pleased to lay down the following
proposition of law:
"46. Thus, on a careful consideration and elucidation of the various
authorities and the case law on the subject discussed above, the following
propositions emerge:
1\. There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, themes, plots or
historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is
confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the
author of the copyright work.
2\. Where the same idea is being developed in a different manner, it is
manifest that the source being common, similarities are bound to occur. In
such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on
fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the
copyrighted work. If the defendants work is nothing but a literal imitation of
the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to
violation of the copyright. In other words, in order to be actionable the copy
must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion
that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.
3\. One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there
has been a violation of copyright is to seeing the reader, spectator or the
viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and
gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy
of the original.
4\. Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so
that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work, no question of
violation of copyright arises.
5.Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there
are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to
copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly
incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence.
6\. As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved
by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the
case law discussed above.
7\. Where however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage
play by a film producer or a Director the task of the plaintiff becomes more
difficult to prove piracy. It is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has
a much broader prospective, a wider field and a bigger background where the
defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and
complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has
expressed the idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film gets a
totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the original
play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved."
29\. When the facts of this case is considered in the light of authoritative
pronouncement by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is to be held that the
applicant cannot claim copyright of idea. In an idea, subject matter, themes,
plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such
case is confined to the form, manner and arrangment and expression of idea,
which is not the case here. The pleaded case and argument raised shows that it
is the same idea, which was developed, therefore, some similarities cannot
make out a case of violation of copyright.
30\. In order to succeed, it was for the plaintiff / applicant to show that
the spectator or the viewer get an unmistakable impression that the subsequent
work appears to be a copy of the original, which is not the case either
pleaded or proved. In this case, admittedly besides similarities, there is
also material and broad dissimilarities, which prima facie shows that there is
no infringement of copy right, therefore, suit filed by the applicant /
plaintiff prima facie does not show infringement of copy right.
31\. Consequently, no other conclusion than the one that the applicant /
plaintiff has failed to make out prima facie case, can be arrived at. The
applicant / plaintiff, in the event of success finally, can always claim
damages, therefore, the balance of convenience is certainly in favour of the
defendants / non applicants, as he has already produced the film and is ready
for release.
32\. For the reasons stated above, finding no merits in these applications,
O.A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2011 are ordered to be dismissed, but with no order as
to costs.
33\. However, it is made clear that anything stated herein above be not taken
it to be final expression on merit of controversy in this case. It will be
open to the parties to lead evidence in support of their respective stand, at
the time of final disposal of the suit. No costs.

30.11.2006 and released the film in Tamil on 20.04.2007, starring Jeevan,
Nameetha, Malavika, Sneha, Keerthi Chawla, Jothimayi, which was directed by

above said film in Hindi version, the plaintiff also purchased the original
rights of the film "WOH MAIN NAHI" vide agreement dated 03.01.2008. The
plaintiff, thus, is copy right owner of film "Nan Avan Illai" in Tamil and

BAHL". It is pleaded case of the plaintiff that it has been reliably learnt

maintainable, as the suit for copy right infringement can only be maintained
