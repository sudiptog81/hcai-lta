Page 2 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017 "Based on the facts and circumstances of the case
and in law, Lam Research (India) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as
Appellant'), respectfully craves leave to prefer an appeal against the
assessment order passed by the learned Assessing Officer [hereinafter referred
to as the learned AO] under section 143(3) read with section 1440 of the
Income-tax Act., 1961 (the Act') on the following grounds:
1\. The learned AO/Transfer Pricing Officer ('TPO') and the learned DRP have
erred, in law and in facts, by making an addition of Rs 1,36,50,206 to the
total income of the Appellant on account of adjustment to the arm's length
price of the software development services transaction entered into by the
Appellant with its associated enterprise;
2\. The learned AO / TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
by not accepting the economic analysis undertaken by the Appellant in
accordance with the provisions of the Act read with the Income Tax Rules, 1962
('Rules'), conducting a fresh economic analysis for the determination of the
ALP in connection with the impugned international transaction, and holding
that the Appellant's international transaction is not at arm's length;
3\. The learned AO / TPO have erred, in law and in facts, by exercising his
powers under section 133(6) of the Act to obtain information which was not
available in public domain and relying on the same for comparability purposes;
4\. The learned AO / TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
by determining the arm's length margin/ price using data pertaining only to FY
2012-13 which was not available to the Appellant at the time of complying with
the transfer pricing documentation requirement;
5\. The learned AO/TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and facts by
rejecting certain comparable companies considered by the Appellant in the
comparability analysis by applying different quantitative and qualitative
filters:
i. The learned AO I TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
by rejecting certain comparable companies identified by the Appellant for
having different accounting year (i.e. companies having accounting year other
than March 31 or companies whose financial statements were for a period other
than 12 months); ii. The learned AO I TPO and the learned DRP have erred, by
rejecting certain comparable companies identified by the Appellant using
employee cost greater than 25% of the total revenues as a comparability
criterion; iii. The learned AO / TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law
and in facts, by rejecting certain comparable companies identified by the
Appellant using export earnings greater than 75% of the sales as a
comparability criterion;
iv. The learned AO I TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
in applying only the lower cap on the turnover filter of Rs.1 crore and not
applying any upper cap for the comparability criterion;
Page 3 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017
6\. The learned AO/ TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
by accepting rejecting companies based on unreasonable comparability criteria;
7\. The learned AO / TFO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and in facts,
by providing an adverse working capital adjustment without appreciating the
fact that the Appellant is a captive service provider;
8\. The learned AO / TPO and the learned DRP have erred, in law and facts, by
not making suitable adjustments to account for differences in the risk profile
of the Appellant vis-à-vis the comparable companies;
9\. The learned AO has erred, in law and facts, by not considering the Self-
Assessment Tax amounting to Rs.4,78,1 11 paid by the Appellant;
10\. The learned AO has erred, in law and facts, in imposing interest under
section 234B and section 2340 of the Act;
11\. The learned AO has erred, in law and in facts, by initiating penalty
proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act.
The Appellant submits that each of the above grounds is independent and
without prejudice to one another.
The Appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend, vary, omit or substitute any
of the aforesaid grounds of appeal at anytime before or at the time of hearing
of the appeal, so as to enable the Hon'ble Tribunal to decide on the appeal in
accordance with the law."

    6.   Ld.TPO          did     not      approve       the   selection   criteria   of
comparables by assessee. The Ld.TPO on his own identified five companies as
comparable with the Assessee company and worked out the average arithmetic
mean of their profit margins as follows:
                      Name of the taxpayer                     OP/OC

                Unadjusted average margin                        21.63%
7\. The Ld.TPO proposed the adjustment to ALP being shortfall at
Rs.1,36,50,206/-.
8\. The Assessee filed objections before the Disputes Resolution Panel (DRP)
against the draft assessment order passed by the Ld.AO wherein the addition
suggested by the Ld.TPO as adjustment to ALP was added to the total income of
the assessee by the Ld.AO. The Assessee filed objections before the DRP and
the DRP gave certain directions. Based on the directions of the DRP, the Ld.AO
passed the final order of assessment. To the extent the Assessee did not get
relief from the DRP, the assessee has preferred appeal before this Tribunal.
9\. At the time of hearing, the Ld.AR submitted that grounds 6(i), 6.2 & 7
were only pressed.
Page 7 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017
10\. The Ld.AR submitted that Grounds 9-11 were consequential in nature.
Accordingly arguments were raised only in respect of following grounds
adjudicated herein above. Ground No. 6.1:
11\. Ld.AR submitted that except for CG Vak software exports Ltd and ICRA
Techno Analytics Ltd, other comparables have been disputed by assessee on
turnover filter. It has been submitted that Ld.TPO while applying the turnover
filter failed to apply the upper limit of Rs.200 crores. He thus submitted
that, following comparables have turnover more than 200 crores and therefore
deserves to be excluded:
> RS software (India) Pvt.Ltd.
> Mindtree Ltd.
> Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd.
> Persistent Systems Ltd.
> Tech Mahindra Ltd.
12\. On the contrary, Ld.CIT.DR relied on orders passed by authorities below.
13\. We have perused submissions advanced both sides in light of records
placed before us.
14\. One of the arguments by the assessee before the Ld.TPO as well as DRP was
that these companies had turnover which was in excess of Rs. 200 crores and
therefore these companies cannot be regarded as a comparable in the case of
the assessee whose turnover was only Rs. 18 crores. The Ld.TPO as well as
Page 8 of 14 IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017 DRP took the view that the functional
comparability of the companies were alone to be seen and turnover was not an
important criterion. In ground No. 5(iv), the assessee has challenged the
order of DRP in holding that higher turnover is not a relevant criterion for
disregarding a company, when it is functionally found to be comparable. The
question boils down on application of turnover filter in choosing comparable
companies. As far as excluding the companies on the basis of turnover is
concerned, the issue has been settled in several decisions of the Tribunal and
has been elaborately discussed by this Tribunal in the case of Autodesk India
(P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2018] 96 taxmann.com 263. This Tribunal in case of
Autodesk India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT (supra) decision after review of entire
case laws on the subject, considered the question, whether companies having
turnover more than 200 crores to 500 crores has to be regarded as one category
and those companies cannot be regarded as comparables with companies having
turnover of less than 200 crores, the Tribunal held as follows:-- "17.7 We
have considered the rival submissions. The substantial question of law
(Question No. 1 to 3) which was framed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the
case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd., (supra) was as to
whether comparable can be rejected on the ground that they have exceptionally
high profit margins or fluctuation profit margins, as compared to the Assessee
in transfer pricing analysis. Therefore as rightly submitted by the learned
counsel for the Assessee the observations of the Hon'ble High Court, in so far
as it refers to turnover, were in the nature of obiter dictum. Judicial
discipline requires that the Tribunal should follow the decision of a non-
jurisdiction High Court, even though the said decision is of a non-
jurisdictional High Court. We however find that the Hon'ble Bombay High Court
in the case of CIT v. Pentair Water India Pvt. Ltd. Tax Appeal No. 18 of 2015
Page 9 of 14 IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017 judgment dated 16-9-2015 has taken the
view that turnover is a relevant criterion for choosing companies as
comparable companies in determination of ALP in transfer pricing cases. There
is no decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue. In the
circumstances, following the principle that where two views are available on
an issue, the view favourable to the Assessee has to be adopted, we
respectfully follow the view of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on the issue.
Respectfully following the aforesaid decision, we uphold the order of the DRP
excluding 5 companies from the list of comparable companies chosen by the TPO
on the basis that the 5 companies turnover was much higher compared to that
the Assessee.
17.8 In view of the above conclusion, there may not be any necessity to
examine as to whether the decision rendered in the case of Genisys Integrating
(supra) by the ITAT Bangalore Bench should continue to be followed. Since
arguments were advanced on the correctness of the decisions rendered by the
ITAT Mumbai and Bangalore Benches taking a view contrary to that taken in the
case of Genisys Integrating (supra), we proceed to examine the said issue
also. On this issue, the first aspect which we notice is that the decision
rendered in the case of Genisys Integrating (supra) was the earliest decision
rendered on the issue of comparability of companies on the basis of turnover
in Transfer Pricing cases. The decision was rendered as early as 5-8-2011. The
decisions rendered by the ITAT Mumbai Benches cited by the learned DR before
us in the case of Willis Processing Services (supra) and Capegemini India Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) are to be regarded as per incurium as these decisions ignore a
binding coordinate bench decision. In this regard the decisions referred to by
the learned counsel for the Assessee supports the plea of the learned counsel
for the Assessee. The decisions rendered in the case of M/S.NTT Data (supra),
Societe Generale Global Solutions (supra) and LSI Technologies (supra) were
rendered later in point of time. Those decisions follow the ratio laid down in
Willis Processing Services (supra) and have to be regarded as per incurium.
These three decisions also place reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the case of Chriscapital Investment (supra). We have already
held that the decision rendered in the case of Chriscapital Investment (supra)
is obiter dicta and that the ratio decidendi laid down by the Hon'ble Bombay
High Court in the case of Pentair (supra) which is favourable to the Assessee
has to be followed. Therefore, the decisions cited by the learned DR before us
cannot be the basis to hold that high turnover is not relevant criteria for
deciding on comparability of companies in determination of ALP under the
Transfer Pricing regulations under the Act. For the reasons given above, we
uphold the order of the CIT(A) on the issue of application of turnover filter
and his action in excluding companies by following the ratio laid down in the
case of Genisys Integrating (supra)."
Page 10 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017
15\. In the light of the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal, comparables
sought for exclusion in Ground No.6.1 raised by the assessee is allowed.
Accordingly this ground stands allowed partly . Ground No. 6.2
16\. Assessee seeks inclusion of only 1 comparable being, Akshay Software
Technologies Ltd. It has been submitted that, the Ld.TPO and DRP accepted this
comparable in the final list in previous years, however for the year under
consideration the same has been excluded. Ld.AR placed reliance on coordinate
bench of this Tribunal in case of M/s NXP India Pvt Ltd. vs DCIT in IT(TP)A
No. 692 & 2861/B/2017 for assessment year 2012-13 and 2013-14.
17\. On the contrary, the Ld.CIT.DR submitted that DRP for excluding this
comparable during the year under consideration has held that the on-site
revenue filter of this comparable is less than 75% and hence rejected it from
the finalist. He submitted that in the preceding years this observation was
not recorded by the authorities below and hence factually cannot be considered
identical.
18\. In the reply by the Ld.AR, it was submitted that is in the decision
relied in case of M/s NXP India Pvt Ltd. vs DCIT (supra) this Tribunal had
analysed this aspect of on-site revenue filter in the following manner:
Page 11 of 14
> IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017 "IV Akshay software technologies Ltd
> 32\. It was rejected by the TPO for the reason that the function of this
> company appears to be more in the nature of support services and I T enabled
> services. However this company is engaged in providing professional
> services, implementation, support and maintenance of ERP products and other
> services. These are nothing but software development services, as is evident
> from the notes forming part of financial statements which is placed in paper
> book at page 1825. Further the revenue from software services accounts for
> 99.45% of the total revenue of the company is evident from the financial
> statements placed on record of paper book at page No. 1831. Being so, we
> direct TPO to consider this company as comparable to assessee's case while
> selecting the comparables."
19\. Based on the above observation the objection raised by DRP cannot be
upheld.
Accordingly we direct Ld. AO/TPO to consider this comparable the finalist.
20\. Ground No. 7 alleged by assessee is against providing negative working
capital adjustment without appreciating the fact that assessee is a captive
service provider. The grievance of the assessee is with regard to negative
working capital adjustment carried out by the Ld.TPO which was confirmed by
the DRP. It is the plea of the assessee that though the Ld.TPO has observed
that the Assessee has a healthy margin, the Ld.TPO has erred in making an
adjustment towards working capital and the DRP further erred in upholding the
same.
Page 12 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017
21\. It was submitted that Working capital adjustment is made for the time
value of money lost when credit time is given to the customers. The Assessee
however does not bear any risk and has no working capital contingencies. The
Assessee has not incurred any expenses for meeting the working capital
requirement. The Assessee is running the business without any working capital
risk as compared to the comparables. The Assessee does not bear any market
risk as the services are provided only to Tavant US. Therefore, requirement
for adjustment of negative working capital does not arise.
22\. The Ld.AR placed reliance on decision of coordinate bench of this
Tribunal in assessee's own case reported in (2020) 120 taxmann.com 122 and Lam
Research India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT in [IT Appeal Nos. 1473 & 1385 (Beng.) of
2014, dated 30-4-2015], Tivo Tech (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2020] 117 taxmann.com
259, and Dy. CIT v. Software AG Bangalore Technologies (P.) Ltd. [IT Appeal
No. 1628 of 2014, dated 31-3-2016], where it has been held that negative
working capital adjustment shall not be made.
23\. We have considered the rival submissions. We find that in the case of Lam
Research India (P.) Ltd. (supra) and Software AG Bangalore Technologies (P.)
Ltd. (supra) passed by this Tribunal, it has been held that negative working
capital adjustment shall not be made in case of a captive service provider as
there is no risk and it is compensated on a total cost plus basis. We
therefore direct Ld.TPO to compute the ALP in accordance with  Page 13 of 14
IT(TP)A No.2490/Bang/2017 the directions contained in this order after
affording assessee opportunity of being heard.
Accordingly ground No. 7 raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
Ground No. 9-11 are consequential in nature and therefore do not require
adjudication.
24\. Assessee has not pressed ground 1-4, ground 5 (i)-(iii), ground 6.1 (c )&
(g) and ground 6.2 (b)-(j) and ground 8. Accordingly these grounds stands
dismissed. In the result appeal filed by assessee stands partly allowed as
indicated hereinabove.
