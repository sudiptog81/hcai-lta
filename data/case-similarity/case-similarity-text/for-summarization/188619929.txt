The captioned appeals have been filed by the Revenue concerning AYs 2011-12 &
2012-13 against the respective orders of the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals)- I, Ahmedabad ('CIT(A)' in short), both dated 18.03.2015 arising

assessment orders both dated 24.03.2013 passed by the AO under s.143(3) r.w.s.
153A(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) .
2\. The assessee has also filed cross objection in the respective appeals of
the Revenue. Both the Revenue's appeals and the cross objections of the
assessee thereon have been heard together owing to similarity of the issues
involved.
3\. We shall first take up Revenue's appeal in IT(SS)A No. 179/Ahd/2015
concerning AY 2011-12.
4\. The grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue read as under:
> "1) The Ld. CIT(A) has erred on law and on facts and circumstances of the
> case in deleting the addition of Rs.1,70,39,124/- being increase in the net
> profit by rejecting books of account u/s.145(3) of the Act."
5\. Briefly stated, the assessee is engaged in the business of construction of
Real Estate and follows Percentage Completion Accounting Method (PCAM) for
working out the profits. A search under s.132 of the Act was carried out in
the case of Sewani Group on 20 t h December, 2011. The assessee, an
individual, is one of the entities of the Sewani Group. Following the
aforesaid search, proceedings under s.153A of the Act were initiated in the
case of the assessee for the specified period covered under first proviso to
Section 153A of the Act i.e. in respect of AYs. 2006-07 to 2012-13. With
regard to the AY 2012-13 (also subject matter of appeal), the return of income
was filed after the date of search on 30 t h September, 2012. However, in
respect of preceding six assessment years, the original return of income were
already filed by the assessee within time permitted under s.139(1) of the Act.
In response to the notices issued under s.153A of the Act, the return of I T (
S S ) A N o s . 1 7 9 & 1 8 0 / Ah d / 1 5 wi t h C O N o s . 1 3 4 & 1 3 5 /

1 1 - 1 2 & 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 - 3 -
income for AY 2011-12 in question was again filed declaring the same income in
parity with original return of income. The assessment proceedings relating to
AY 2011-12 falling within the period of six assessment years referred to under
s.153A of the Act and pending on the date of initiation of search under s.132
of the Act stood abated and the assessment was framed under s.153A(1)(b) of
the Act.
5.1 In the course of the assessment proceedings under s.153A of the Act, the
AO inter alia raised queries regarding correctness of profits declared as per
the books of accounts, the replies thereof were not found satisfactory by him.
It was observed by the AO that books of accounts were inconsistent vis-à-vis
the closing stock valuation shown by the assessee. It was alleged that the
assessee has arbitrarily claimed expenses without justification and also did
not capitalize the interest expenses adequately in proportion to the project
size. The AO accordingly re-casted the project-wise 'construction account' of
the assessee representing the stock, WIP, direct expenses relating to various
projects undertaken and the closing stock of various projects were increased
as a result of certain adjustments. As a result of readjustments, year-wise
net profit/loss of the assessee was re-computed as under:
     Assessment                     Actual Net Profit                     Net    profit      as   Increase/(Decrease)
     Year                           as per the above                      shown    by       the
                                    working                               assessee

We are however presently concerned with proceedings in relation to AY 2011-12
and 2012-13 in question.
5.2 It was alleged by the AO that the books of accounts of the assessee did
not give true and fair picture of the affairs of the business under s.145(3)
of the Act. The AO gathered information from the assessee in connection with
various projects in progress and method of the accounting vis-à-vis closing
stock valuation and consequently re-computed taxable profits for various
assessment years falling within the specified period in search assessment on
the basis of re-computation of ' cost of goods' sold and 'closing work- in-
progress' on year to year basis.
5.3 The books of accounts were rejected by invoking Section 145(3) of the Act
and the 'cost of sales' and 'closing stock' was re- worked whereby the
additions were made in respect of understatement of profits to the extent of
Rs.1,70,39,124/- to the total income of the assessee for AY 2011-12 in
question. Similar additions were made in respect of other assessment years as
tabulated above.
6\. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeal before the CIT(A). The CIT(A)
after consideration of the detailed submissions made on behalf of the assessee
and the comments of the AO thereon in the remand report, found the action of
the AO to be unsustainable. The relevant operative para of the order of the
CIT(A) is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:
> "7. The appellant contended that the A.O. recast construction account on
> cast basis and when there was plus difference, the same was added to the
> closing work in progress as disclosed in the audited I T ( S S ) A N o s . 1

> 0 1 2 - 1 3 - 5 -
> accounts of the appellant, however, even when the difference was in minus in
> work in progress, the same was also added to closing work in progress
> disclosed in the audited account of the appellant. Such erroneous method of
> the A.O. resulted into addition of difference in either case in the cost of
> the construction account. He assumed that in a situation when there is a
> profit in the construction account recast on cost basis, it implied that the
> cost of the sales wer e overstated and the closing stock was understated to
> that extend. Similarly, it was further assumed that when there was loss on
> the recast of account, the closing stock was undervalued to that extend.
> Such exercise of the A.O- was based on assumptions without any corroborative
> evidence and contrary to the accepted accounting principles.
> 7.1 The AO, in the remand report, gave his comment that "in this year the
> return of income is accepted considering the outcome of appeal"
> 7.2 The submission of the appellant was that the A.O. considered actual cost
> of the project on the basis of the audited annual accounts for the period
> from 01-04-2005 to 31-03-2012 whereas the appellant computed work in
> progress on year to year basis after considering actual expenditure incurred
> in the relevant A.Y. and accordingly estimated total cost of the project.
> The assessee considered average cost of land and construction similar to the
> working of the A.O. in the recasting of the accounts. The A.O. made
> assessment for the A.Y. 2006-07 to 2012-13 in the F.Y. 2013-14 when he was
> having complete details of the actual expenditure incurred by the appellant
> upto 31-03-2012. It was impossible for the assessee to have the details of
> the actual expenditure when he was making valuation of work in progress for
> A.Y. 2006-07 to A.Y, 2011-12 on year to year basis, Therefore, the entire
> method of re-computing the cost of closing work in progress stock was
> totally erroneous and impractical.
> 7.3 The appellant contended that the A.O. committed errors in adopting the
> figure of actual net profit as he worked out net profit without considering
> the figures of deferred taxes and income tax whereas the appellant did not
> claim the provisions for income tax or deferred tax in the return of income.
> Therefore, such factually erroneous assumption of the AO resulted into

> a tabular chart for A.Y. 2008-09 and 2009-10 to substantiate his contention.
> 7.4 The AO, in the remand report, gave his comment that the contention of

> 7.7 The appellant furnished the working of the A.O., regarding the cost of
> goods sold in the project known as Shoppers Plaza-4 in the A.Y. 2008-09. He
> contended that there were patent mistakes in the working of the area sold
> because he considered the sold area of 14222 sq. ft. only and the cost of
> the total constructed area sold was adopted at Rs.1,53,960/-. The average
> cost of construction of the sold area was taken @ Rs.11 per sq. ft. only. It
> was emphasized by the appellant that contrary to this rate, the AO adopted
> the cost of construction of the entire project @ Rs. 918.62 per sq. ft, It
> was an example of glaring mistake of the AO.
> 7.8 In the remand report, the AO made a comment on the contention of the

> 7.9 Further contention of the appellant was that the A.O. committed serious
> error in adopting the figure of net interest expenses in the A.Y. 2009-10
> while allocating interest of Rs.1,13,65,012/- to different projects. It was
> submitted to the A.O. that interest cost of Rs. 62,52,000/- was already
> allocated to Shopers Plaza-4, despite this fact, the A.O. committed error in
> duplication of allocation of the interest which resulted into higher profit.
> 7.10 In the remand report, the AO made a comment on the contention of the
> appellant that the contention of the assessee was factually correct,
> however, after considering the same, the additio n was made.
> 8\. The appellant contended that the A.O. disallowed interest expenditure on
> the ground that it cannot be considered as revenue expenditure, though it
> was a part of cost of construction, He further I T ( S S ) A N o s . 1 7 9 &

> 8.1 The assessee contended that the assessments for the A.Y. 2006- 07,
> 2008-09 and 2009-10 were made u/s 143(3) wherein the issues including method
> of accounting were already dealt with. The Department had accepted the

> the books of account were correct and gave true and fair view of the state
> of business affairs, therefore, there was no question to recast the total
> P&L account by rejecting the books of account. To the best of Knowledge of
> the assessee, the method suggested by the A.O. did not have any locus standi
> as it was not-prescribed under any accounting standard nor was it prescribed
> under any of the provisions of the Income Tax act.
> 8.2 The method of accounting suggested by the A.O. could only be possible

> suggest the assessee some manner as to how the assessee should have adopted
> the actual cost of the project in the first year when the very project was
> to be completed in subsequent years. If the same method cannot be adopted as
> suggested by the A.O., th e assessee did not know how to determine the
> income to be offered for tax in the first year. Therefore, the method
> proposed by the A.O. was erroneous and could not be applied in the real
> word.
> 8.3 The contents of the Assessment Order, submission of the appellant and

> method was regularly followed by the assessee and the same was accepted by

> 8.4 The A.O. called for details such as cost of land, construction, interest
> and other expenses. Books of account were also called for during the
> assessment proceedings. These facts are evident from the contents of the

> closing stock, project-wise expenses of cost of land, construction and
> allocation of interest amongst the projects and other details of sale of

> the actual project-wise cost of the projects from the audited annual

> the projects were almost completed when he recast the construction account
> and made the working of the value of work in progress. It is also a fact on

> that his working was patently wrong and contrary to the facts of the case.

> The CIT(A) accordingly reversed the action of the AO and deleted the
> addition so made towards understatement of business profits.

8\. The learned DR for the Revenue relied upon the order passed by the AO and
submitted that the AO has made a detailed re- working of 'construction
account' at cost and allocated the expenditure and interest costs in relation
to various projects to arrive at the true profits deducible from the various
projects concerning different assessment years. It was found by the AO that
accounts showing profits arising from the projects developed and sold have not
been correctly drawn and the assessee has overstated the costs of sale and
understated the closing stock which has resulted in lower declaration of
business profits. The learned DR submitted that the books of accounts of the
assessee was rightly rejected by invoking provisions of Section 145(3) of the
Act in the circumstances as it failed to give a true and fair picture of the
affairs of the construction business of the assessee. It was contended that
the CIT(A) has reversed the action of AO without making objective analysis of
facts.
9\. The learned senior counsel for the assessee, on the other hand, submitted
at the outset that assessment year beginning from 2006-07 to 2012-13 are
subject matter of assessment scheme pertaining to search assessment. It was
pointed out that the assessments concerning AYs 2006-07 to 2010-11 were not
pending at the time of search and consequently did not abate and thus
additions made under s.153A of the Act for these assessment years have been
set aside and quashed in the appellate proceedings due to absence of any
incriminating material found in the course of the search. Therefore, remaining
AYs. 2011-12 & 2012-13 in question alone are subject to factual analysis
before the Tribunal for the first time without any precedent on facts.

9.1 It was submitted that the AO has totally misconstrued and misconceived the
factual matrix for subject assessment years. It was submitted that the
accounts of the assessee are audited and the AO has not found any
understatement of sales or over statement of expenses per se. The AO has
merely indulged in re-adjustment of cost of land, cost of construction, cost
of sales and closing stock in the construction account from the very figures
available in the books of accounts. The interest costs have been reallocated
arbitrarily and without any sound basis resulting in double charge at places.
The learned Senior Counsel strongly hoisted that the method adopted by the AO
while computing the estimated net profit is patently wrong and beyond
contemplation. The learned senior counsel inter alia referred to the net
profit determined by the AO to be in negative i.e. at loss of Rs.1,76,41,935/-
for AY 2010-11 as against the actual profit of Rs.20,89,570/- offered by the
assessee himself and consequently, determined loss at Rs.1,97,31,505/- for the
immediately preceding assessment year 2010-11. However, oddly enough, the AO
has ultimately conveniently ignored the favourable position emerging in some
years and thus not assessed the total income at loss wherever there is a loss
or wherever there is a decrease in the profit in the earlier assessment years.
The learned senior counsel thus submitted that such instances would vindicate
the stance of the assessee that the approach of the AO is wholly without
rationale. The learned senior counsel thereafter referred to the remand report
dated 13.12.2014 and pointed out that the AO himself found the contention of
the assessee to be factual correct at several places but the effect for the
same was not given in the remand proceedings. The net profits were
artificially arrived from the re-adjustments of the costs incurred by the
assessee. I T ( S S ) A N o s . 1 7 9 & 1 8 0 / Ah d / 1 5 wi t h C O N o s .

9.2 The learned senior counsel thereafter assailed the action of the AO to
invoke the provisions of Section 145(3) of the Act and contended that such
action of the AO is devoid of any legitimacy. The learned senior counsel
relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Pr.CIT
vs. Garden Silk Mills Ltd. [2016] 388 ITR 237 (Guj) for the proposition that
where the AO could not pinpoint any specific defect in the working result, the
additions made on account of under valuation of work-in-progress could not be
sufficient to reject the books of account. The learned senior counsel further
relied upon the decision in the case of CIT vs. Ceremic Industries [2017] 396
ITR 50 (Raj) & CIT vs. Jananamandal Ltd. [2013] 214 taxmann.com 49 (All.) for
the proposition that the rejection of accounts on account of inconsistency in
input and output ratio etc. is not permissible where the deviation has been
properly explained by the assessee.
9.3 The learned senior counsel, in essence, submitted that the action of the
AO was without any basis which has been rightly reversed by the CIT(A) on
proper appreciation of evidence placed before it and in sync with position of
law as interpreted by the judiciary. The learned senior counsel submitted that
the conclusion drawn by the CIT(A) does not warrant any interference from the
Tribunal.
10\. We have carefully considered the rival submissions. The addition of
Rs.1,70,39,124/- to the taxable business income from the construction business
by resorting to re-casting of construction account representing closing stock,
work-in-progress and direct expenses by the AO is in controversy. The question
is essentially factual in nature.

10.1 It is the case of the Revenue that the action of the AO in making
enhancement to the declared net profits by re-calculating the cost of sales
and closing stock of various projects is fully justified in view of the
exhaustive working made by the AO as annexed to the assessment order. The
assessee, on the other hand, has found fault with the action of the AO on
multiple counts both on facts as well as on first principles and contended
that the action of the AO is not sustainable on facts or in law. It is the
case of the assessee that allegation of the AO towards incorrect reflection of
business profits derived from construction business by assessee is without any
foundation. The AO has merely proceeded on assumptions and surmises in a most
arbitrary manner and rejected the books of accounts and applied his own
arbitrary method for working out the profits of the assessee during AYs.
2006-07 to 2012-13. It is the contention of the assessee that books of
accounts are audited by the independent auditors equipped with requisite
expertise and well versed with principles of accountancy and accounting
standards and therefore a normal presumption would arise that the books are
reliable and gives true picture of his business affairs. Thus, the onus would
shift heavily on the AO for discarding the books results. It is further case
of the assessee that the assessments for AYs. 2006- 07, 2008-09 & 2009-10 were
framed under s.143(3) of the Act wherein the book results drawn following the
prescribed method of accounting on similar lines was duly accepted in the
scrutiny assessment.
10.2 A perusal of the order of the CIT(A) gives an impression that the AO has
committed some factual errors while determining the estimated profits year
after year. Similar factual errors are stated to be committed while allocating
the interest costs over various I T ( S S ) A N o s . 1 7 9 & 1 8 0 / Ah d / 1
5 wi t h C O N o s . 1 3 4 & 1 3 5 / Ah d / 2 0 1 5 [ D C I T v s . S h r i S
u n i l P . S e wa n i ] A. Y s . 2 0 1 1 - 1 2 & 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 - 13 -
projects. The correct measurement of various projects was stated to be
mistaken which led to some anomaly in working. We observe from the findings
recorded by the CIT(A) that the AO considered and regrouped the actual costs
of the project picking up the figures from audited annual accounts for the
period covering AYs. 2006-07 to 2012-13 whereas the assessee computed work-in-
progress on year to year basis on the basis of actual expenditure incurred. It
is the contention of the assessee that the AO at the time of assessment in FY
2013-14 was having complete and authentic details of factual expenditure
incurred by the assessee up to 31.03.2012 whereas it was impossible for the
assessee to have the details of actual expenditure to be incurred at the time
of valuation of work-in- progress for AY 2006-07 to 2011-12 on year-to-year
basis. This has essentially resulted in deviation in the profits deducted by
the assessee vis-à-vis by the AO on year to year basis. It was pointed out
that the CIT(A) after taking note of the observations made by the AO in the
remand report has concluded that the action of the AO in re-computing the
project-wise profit is marred with adhocism and pick & choose method. The
CIT(A) accordingly reversed the action of the AO in toto and upheld the
working results declined by the assessee.
10.3 At this stage, we also note that the assessee has strongly objected to
the rejection of books of account without any cogent reasons. It was pointed
out that wrong and erroneous assumptions were applied in re-casting the
construction account on cost basis whereby the positive difference was added
to the closing work-in- progress as disclosed in the audited accounts whereas
the negative difference in the work-in-progress was also added to the closing
work-in-progress. The action of the AO implies that where the cost I T ( S S )

1 2 & 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 - 14 -
of sales are overstated the closing stock would be correspondingly
understated. But, however it was simultaneously assumed that in the case of
loss, the closing stock is also under valued to this extent. Such action of
the AO is contrary to rudimentary principles of accounting. It is the case of
the assessee that as per the accepted accounting principles as applicable to
the construction business, the cost is required to be estimated at the end of
each year on the basis of technical estimation and after estimating the
project cost, the assessee is required to determine the cost of sale to be
charged profit and loss account against the sale value. The sale value has
been recognized on a percentage completion basis regardless of pendency in
completion of work of the project.
10.4 Having taken note of the principal contentions led on behalf of the
assessee, we however find that while adjudicating the issue, the approach of
the CIT(A) appears to be quite generic and devoid of objectivity. While
pointing out some errors of lesser impact here and there, the CIT(A) has not
compared the project-wise working as per the assessee and as per the AO to
locate the area of difference. The CIT(A) has merely set aside the working of
the AO without bringing on board, the comparison with the working shown by the
assessee. We do not find reference to such working anywhere either in the
assessment order or in the CIT(A)'s order. It is thus difficult to exactly
gauge purported anomaly and deviation in the working of the AO qua that of
assessee. The CIT(A) has merely found fault with the remand report to be
without any explanation. The AO has already provided working in the assessment
order. In the absence of any additional evidence, we do not see any ostensible
reason for AO to redo the same exercise based on some submissions of the
assessee. The onus was equally placed on the assessee to point out I T ( S S )
A N o s . 1 7 9 & 1 8 0 / Ah d / 1 5 wi t h C O N o s . 1 3 4 & 1 3 5 / Ah d /

1 2 & 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 - 15 -
exact area of difference and explanation thereon. The CIT(A) has apparently
abdicated his responsibilities and shifted the onus again on the AO without
any cogent reason. In the absence of objective comparison available for the
resultant profits declared by the assessee and computed by the AO, we consider
it befitting and expedient to restore the matter back to the file of the
CIT(A). The CIT(A) shall call for the comparative analysis and other factual
details and look into all the aspects afresh objectively and in accordance
with law. Needless to say, proper opportunity shall be provided to assessee in
this regard. The issue is accordingly set aside to the file of the CIT(A) for
de novo adjudication.
10.5 While coming to aforestated conclusion, we also take note of the
objection raised on behalf of the assessee for rejection of books by invoking
Section 145(3) of the Act. However, we are unable to notice any such objection
has been raised before lower authorities. In the Revenue's appeal, it will be
difficult to appreciate such technical aspect without notice to other side.
Thus, such ground requires to be shunned. Be it as it may, we find that the AO
has given a very detailed working for determining true profits and consequent
defect in the determination of profits. Thus, we do not find any substance in
such objection.
11\. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is allowed for statistical
purposes.

13\. At the time of hearing, it was fairly submitted on behalf of the assessee
that the legal objection towards validity of assessment under s.153A of the
Act raised in the cross objection is not sustainable for the impugned
assessment years and therefore the same may be treated as not pressed.
14\. In the result, cross objection in CO No. 134/Ahd/2015 is thus dismissed
as not pressed.
IT(SS)A No. 180/Ahd/2015 - AY 2012-13
15\. The grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue read as under:

> case in deleting the addition of Rs.1,79,98,200/- being increase in the net
> profit by rejecting books of account u/s.145(3) of the Act."
16\. The issue towards addition of Rs.1,79,98,200/- to the net profit flowing
from the recast of construction account by AO by rejecting books of accounts
is identical and in continuation to AY 2011-12. We therefore, in parity, hold
that similar treatment be given to the AY 2012-13 as well. The order of the
CIT(A) is accordingly set aside to I T ( S S ) A N o s . 1 7 9 & 1 8 0 / Ah d

the file of the AO and the CIT(A) is directed to examine the issue de novo in
accordance with law also after obtaining relevant facts in this regard from
the assessee as may be considered expedient for disposal of the appeal.
17\. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is allowed for statistical
purposes.
CO No. 135/Ahd/2015 - AY 2012-13
18\. The grounds of appeal raised by the assessee read as under:

19\. Ground No.1 is not pressed. Thus, Ground No.1 is dismissed as not
pressed.
20\. Ground No.2 was also stated to be not pressed in the bar owing to
smallness of the addition. Ground No.2 is accordingly dismissed as not
pressed.
