Petitioner has preferred this petition, under Section 439 Cr.P.C., seeking
regular bail in case Crime No. 66 of 2019,  1 Whether Reporters of Local
Papers may be allowed to see the judgment?
::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45 :::HCHP 2
dated 7.11.2019 registered under Sections 8, 20, 25, 28, 29 and 60 of Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, .
(hereinafter referred to as 'NDPS Act') in Police Station Narcotics Control
Bureau,Chandigarh, District Chandigarh.
2 Prosecution case, as evident from copy of complaint filed with petition, is
that on 7.11.2019, a specific information was received by Rajan Singh Bisht,
Surveillance Assistant NCB through reliable source with respect to trafficking
of charas and opium, which was reduced into writing by him and put up before
Superintendent r NCB Chandigarh at 01.05 PM, whereupon Superintendent NCB had
instructed to constitute a team to take further necessary action as per law.
3 As per information, two persons, namely Kuldeep and Hardeep, both resident
of Mani Majra Chandigarh, were engaged in charas and opium trafficking and
they had been transporting a huge consignment of charas and opium on that day,
received from one Dev Raj, resident of Banjar to deliver it to one Karamvir @
Landa resident of Pinjore (petitioner) by using Mahindra Pickup vehicle
bearing No. HP-12J-4403 and they were likely to reach at Toll Barrier Baddi
between 4 PM to 5 PM.
4 It is the case of prosecution that on 7.11.2019 at about 2.45 PM, the team
constituted by Superintendent NCB  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45
:::HCHP 3 reached at Toll Barrier Baddi Himachal Pradesh and contacted Police
Station Baddi with request to provide two independent .
witnesses. Further that despite best of efforts made by the team, no one from
the local public had agreed to witness the search and seizure proceedings,
but, at about 3.45 PM, two police officials namely Akram Khan and Shiv Kumar
Constables, posted in Police Station Baddi, had approached the scene. Both of
them were introduced to NCB team by Investigating Officer and were made aware
of secret information. Both of them were requested, in writing, to witness the
search and seizure proceedings for which they had agreed.
5 According to prosecution, at about 4.45 PM Mahindra Pickup, matching with
secret information, reached the Toll Barrier which was stopped and person
sitting at driver's seat, on inquiry had introduced him as Kuldeep son of
Gafur, resident of Mani Majra and person sitting besides him had disclosed his
name as Hardeep Kumar son of Harish Kumar. They were taken to nearby barrier
of Excise and Taxation Office and Investigating Officer had introduced himself
and his team members including independent witnesses to them by showing
Identity Cards and also about the secret information received by him with
respect to trafficking of  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45 :::HCHP 4
charas and opium by both of them and therefore, expressed the intention to
search the vehicle Mahinder Pickup van.
.
6 It is further case of prosecution that during search of pickup van, at first
instance, nothing was recovered. However, on stern inquiry, both of them had
confessed that they had concealed the charas and opium in a special cavity
made at backside of pickup, below the registration number plate whereupon
pickup van was again searched and both of them had removed the number plate
and had taken out 10 silver colored packets and informed that one of those
packets was containing opium, while other nine were containing charas.
7 Recovered contraband was weighed and seized by following the procedure
provided under NDPS Act and total recovered charas was found 8 Kg. 750 grams
and recovered opium was found 1.020 Kg.
8 On 8.11.2019 Karamvir petitioner was served with summons under Section 67 of
NDPS Act and his house as well as his vehicle Car No. CH-01BU-2516 were
searched. Besides other articles, three mobile phones, a silver small weighing
machine and an electronic compact scale were also recovered and seized from
his residence. During investigation, on 8.11.2019 voluntary statements under
Section 67 of NDPS Act of all i.e. Kuldeep,  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020
21:24:45 :::HCHP 5 Hardeep and Karamvir were recorded by Investigating
Officer, after explaining about their right that they were not bound to .
give any statement and they were at liberty to remain silent and any
statement, if given by them, could be used against them or against anybody-
else as evidence in Court.
9 According to prosecution, in their statements, all of them had accepted
their guilt and role in procurement and trafficking the seized contraband.
Based on voluntary statements, all of them were arrested on 8.11.2019.
10
It is case of prosecution that during investigation, call detail reports
(CDRs) of mobile phones of trio were also obtained and it was found that
mobile numbers 78075-30188, 62303-
49337, 88940-41593 were being controlled by Karamvir petitioner, whereas
mobile numbers 86278-86848 and 86278-
67931 were being controlled by Kuldeep and Dev Raj respectively. Analysis of
CDRs of these numbers had established the link between petitioner Karamvir
(receiver), carrier Kuldeep and Hardeep, and supplier Dev Raj.
11 Learned counsel for petitioner has canvassed for enlargement of petitioner
on bail on two grounds. First ground is that petitioner is entitled for bail
on health ground and vide application Cr.MP No. 1475 of 2020,
documents/prescription slips  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45 :::HCHP
6 of treatment of petitioner were also placed on record on behalf of
petitioner, whereupon, Mr. Desh Raj Thakur, learned Additional .
Advocate General was requested to assist the Court by having report of
Superintendent Jail, Model Central Jail Nahan as well as Medical Officer of
Jail.
12 In response thereto, Mr. Raju Ram Rahi, learned Deputy Advocate General has
placed on record communication received from Superintendent Jail, Model
Central Jail, Nahan HP along with report and photocopies of documents,
wherein, it has been reported that petitioner was admitted to Model Central
Jail Nahan on 14th March, 2020 after transferring him from District Jail,
Solan and on medical examination, he was found suffering from CAD (Coronary
Artery Disease), Hypertension and Psychiatric illness for which as per his
Jail Medical Record, he was already under treatment. Further that petitioner
has been suffering from CAD since 2017 and has underwent Stenting Procedure
for same on 19.9.2017 at PGI and was discharged on 22.9.2007 and he is on
regular medication and constant follow up.
13 Lastly, it is reported that petitioner is on regular medication, and proper
treatment and care is being provided to  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020
21:24:45 :::HCHP 7 him by Jail Authorities and currently, he is stable and
doing well in jail.
.
14 To substantiate the report of Superintendent Jail, opinion of Medical
Officer of Jail has also been placed on record.
15 Considering the report of Superintendent Jail of Model Central Jail coupled
with contents of opinion of Medical Officer, I do not find any sufficient
reason for enlarging the petitioner on bail on health ground.
16 Second ground for enlarging the petitioner on bail is that he has been
implicated in present case only on the basis of statement under Section 67 of
NDPS Act, whereas on the basis of statement of Section 67 of NDPS Act, as held
by Apex Court in Criminal Appeal No. 152 of 2013, titled Tofan Singh vs. State
of Tamil Nadu, decided on 29.10.2020, a statement recorded under Section 67 of
NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence
under NDPS Act.
17 There is no dispute with respect to law laid down by the Supreme Court,
relied upon by petitioner. However, as a matter of fact in present case
petitioner has not been involved in the case only on the basis of statement
recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act, but, as claimed by prosecution, a prior
information about his involvement in procuring, trafficking and  :::
Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45 :::HCHP 8 selling the charas and opium was
received by a Surveillance Assistant of NCB on 7.11.2019, which was reduced
into writing .
and placed before the Officer of rank of Superintendent NCB whereupon a team
was constituted and that information was substantiated on recovery of charas
and opium from vehicle wherein Kuldeep and Hardeep (accused) were found
transporting the contraband and involvement of Karamvir petitioner has further
been substantiated by CDRs record and also on recovery of a silver small
weighing machine and electronic compact scale from his residence and
therefore, it is not a case where petitioner has been involved only on basis
of voluntary statement recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act or only on the
basis of disclosure statement made by co-accused. Therefore, plea of
petitioner on this count is not sustainable.
18 Veracity of evidence narrated by prosecution is to be evaluated by trial
Court. Facts of prosecution case and contentions of petitioner have been
reproduced herein-above only for bringing the necessary facts on record, which
were essential to be considered for adjudication of this petition.
19 Without commenting upon merits of prosecution case as well as contentions
raised by petitioner, but for nature and gravity of offence, impact thereof on
society and quantum of  ::: Downloaded on - 07/12/2020 21:24:45 :::HCHP 9

the basis of statement made under Section 67 .
of NDPS Act, I do not find any reason for enlarging the petitioner on bail at
this stage.
20 In view of above, petition is dismissed. Any observation made in this order
shall not affect the merits of case in any manner and will strictly confine
