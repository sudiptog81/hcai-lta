    HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD

    Court No. - 34
    Review Application No. 348035 of 2013
    In
    Case :- WRIT - A No. - 22677 of 1996
    Petitioner :- Krishna Kant Katiyar
    Respondent :- State Of U.P.& Others
    Counsel for Petitioner :- A.K.Yadav,Ajay Yadav,S.K. Katiyar
    Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
    Hon'ble Sudhir Agarwal, J.
1\. This is an application seeking review of my order dated 23.7.2013
dismissing the writ petition on merits.
2\. It is contended that petitioner has continued in service pursuant to
interim order dated 24.7.1996 during the pendency of this writ petition, but
due to dismissal of writ petition, he is now being sought to be terminated
which fact has not been noticed by this Court. He also said that since he has
(C) AIR 1994 Allahabad 273 Kanoria Chemicals & Industries Ltd. v. U.P. State
Electricity Board.
"After the dismissal of the writ petitions wherein notification dated
21.4.1990 was stayed, the result brought about by the interim orders staying
the notification, became non est in the eye of law and lost all its efficacy
and the notification became effective from the beginning."
8\. In Raghvendra Rao etc. Vs. State of Karnataka and others, JT 2009 (2) SC
520 the Apex Court has observed:
"It is now a well-settled principle of law that merely because an employee had
continued under cover of an order of Court, he would not be entitled to any
right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service. ............."
9\. On the contrary, I find that order passed by Settlement Officer
(Consolidation) declaring the petitioner permanent is patently without
jurisdiction and, the said Officer definitely has committed a serious
misconduct and this matter need be seen in disciplinary side by respondent no.
1.
which fact has not been noticed by this Court. He also said that since he has
continued pursuant to interim order passed by this Court, Settlement Officer
(Consolation) on 11.7.2002 also declared him permanent and this fact ought to
have been considered by the Court.
3\. The submission is thoroughly misconceived. Once the petitioner has ceased
to work and stood already terminated, whereagainst he came to this Court, his
continuance pursuant to an interim order passed by this Court will not confer
a new right upon him which he did not possess at the time of filing the writ
petition, particularly, when the writ petition itself has ultimately failed.
4\. Mere fact that an interim order was passed and incumbent was continuing on
the post, that would not confer any benefit or cause of action to petitioner
if ultimately he does not succeed in the writ petition.
5\. A Division Bench of this Court presided by Hon'ble C.K. Prasad, C.J. (as
His Lordship then was), while rejecting the claim of appellant to continue in
service on the basis of long continuance pursuant to an interim order passed
by this Court, in Special Appeal No. 1818 of 2009 (Farhat Jahan Vs. State of
U.P. and others) decided on 26.11.2009 observed as under:
"She had continued in service by virtue of an interim order passed by this
Court. This continuance of the petitioner during the pendency of the writ
petition is a litigious continuance in service, which will not enure to her
benefit. The Division Bench of this Court had the occasion to consider this
question in Special Appeal No.926 of 2002 (Sunil Kumar Vs. The Regional
Assistant Director of Education (Basic), 12 Circle, Moradabad), which reads as
follows "Having appreciated the rival submission, we do not find any substance
in the submission of Mr. Saxena and the decision relied on shall have no
bearing in the facts of the present case. As stated earlier, the petitioner
was appointed by order dated 22.4.1987 on temporary basis and the order of
appointment clearly indicated that his service can be terminated without any
notice or prior information. His service was terminated in exercise of power
under Rule 3 of the Rules 1975 by order dated 5.9.1988. Petitioner has,
nowhere, averred as to the process of appointment, which was followed while
giving him temporary appointment. True it is that by virtue of interim orders
passed by this court, he continued in service but such continuance is nothing
but a "litigious employment". Once it is held so, mere continuance in service
for a long period would not clothe him with any right. The view, which we have
taken, finds support from the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of
Umadevi (supra) as also Surindra Prasad Tiwari (supra)."
In view of aforesaid, we are of the opinion that the litigious continuance in
service shall not enure to her benefit."
6\. It is well established that act of the court shall prejudice none. The
service rendered pursuant to an interim order would not give any benefit to
petitioner. This issue has also been considered by a Division Bench of this
Court (in which I was also a member) in Smt. Vijay Rani Vs. Regional
Inspectress of Girls Schools, Region-1, Meerut and others, 2007(2) ESC 987 and
the Court held as under:
"An interim order passed by the Court merges with the final order and,
therefore, the result brought by dismissal of the writ petition is that the
interim order becomes non est. A Division Bench of this court in Shyam Lal Vs.
State of U.P. AIR 1968 Allahabad 139, while considering the effect of
dismissal of writ petition on interim order passed by the court has laid down
as under:
"It is well settled that an interim order merges in the final order and does
not exist by itself. So the result brought about by an interim order would be
non est in the eye of law if the final order grants no relief. The grant of
interim relief when the petition was ultimately dismissed could not have the
effect to postponing implementation of the order of compulsory retirement. It
must in the circumstances take effect as if there was no interim order."
7\. The same principal has been reiterated in the following cases:
(A) AIR 1975 Allahabad 280 Sri Ram Charan Das V. Pyare Lal.
"In Shyam Lal Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1968 All 139 a Bench of this Court has
held that orders of stay of injunction are interim orders that merge in final
orders passed in the proceedings. The result brought about by the interim
order becomes non est in the eye of law in final order grants no relief. In
this view of the matter it seems to us that the interim stay became non est
and lost all the efficacy, the commissioner having upheld the permission which
became effective from the date it was passed."
(B) 1986 (4) LCD 196 Shyam Manohar Shukla V. State of U.P.
"It is settled law that an interim order passed in a case which is ultimately
dismissed is to be treated as not having been passed at all (see Shyam Lal V.
State of Uttar Pradesh) Lucknow, AIR 1968 Allahabad 139 and Sri Ram Charan Das
v. Pyare Lal, AIR 1975 Allahabad 280 (DB)."
(C) AIR 1994 Allahabad 273 Kanoria Chemicals & Industries Ltd. v. U.P. State
Electricity Board.
"After the dismissal of the writ petitions wherein notification dated
21.4.1990 was stayed, the result brought about by the interim orders staying
the notification, became non est in the eye of law and lost all its efficacy
and the notification became effective from the beginning."
8\. In Raghvendra Rao etc. Vs. State of Karnataka and others, JT 2009 (2) SC
520 the Apex Court has observed:
"It is now a well-settled principle of law that merely because an employee had
continued under cover of an order of Court, he would not be entitled to any
right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service. ............."
9\. On the contrary, I find that order passed by Settlement Officer
(Consolidation) declaring the petitioner permanent is patently without
jurisdiction and, the said Officer definitely has committed a serious
misconduct and this matter need be seen in disciplinary side by respondent no.

10\. The application is rejected.
11\. A copy of this order shall be forwarded by Registrar General to
respondent no. 1 for information and compliance.
