                       (Rekha Gaud Vs. The State of M.P. & Others)

          Shri Santosh Agrawal, learned counsel for the petitioner.
          Shri Purushottam Rai, learned Panel Lawyer for the State.
          Shri Arvind Dudawat, learned counsel for respondent No.3 & 4.
1\. The challenge in this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution by
the petitioner claiming himself to be owner of survey No.47/2 min Halka No.4,
Mubarikpura, Narwar, District Shivpuri (M.P.) is to the order of Collector,
Shivpuri dated 20/04/2011 (Annexure P/1) whereby on the basis of preliminary
enquiry conducted by the SDO, Karera which was taken cognizance of by the
Collector, Shivpuri on 10/01/2011, two hectares of land bearing survey No.47
was declared to belong to the Government, after canceling the order dated
30/09/2011 passed by the Tehsildaar settling the said land which was earlier
recorded as 'Pahad' in favour of one Hamum Khan S/o Sardar Khan.

10.1 Moreso, the ground of quashment of the impugned order merely on the
ground of breach of principle of audi alteram partem would amount to revival
of fraudulent orders and transactions which can never be the object of the
power of judicial review.
11\. Consequently, the present petition having no force is dismissed with
liberty to the petitioner to raise her grievance before the civil Court in
recorded as 'Pahad' in favour of one Hamum Khan S/o Sardar Khan.
2\. Pertinently, the said Hamum Khan got himself recorded as bhoomiswami
without following the due process of law whereafter it is alleged that the
land in question exchanged various hands and is presently recorded in favour
of petitioner based upon the registered sale deed dated 26/03/2004 vide
Annexure P/2.
3\. It is relevant to point out that highlighting the aforesaid unlawful
change of use and transfer of Government land into private hands was
highlighted in PIL bearing WP No.2846/2010 which was disposed of by order
dated 21/05/2010 in the following terms:-
> "In this context, our attention has been drawn to  2 WP No.3185/2011
> Annexure P/- dated 28/10/2009 submitted by the petitioner to the Collector,
> Shivpuri.
> Since the order has not yet passed by the Collector, Shivpuri we dispose of
> this petition with a direction to the Collector Shivpuri to decide the
> application submitted by the petitioner on 28/10/2009 within a period of 15
> days from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order."
3.1 When the aforesaid order in PIL was not complied with, contempt bearing
CONC No.433/2010 was filed which was disposed of by order dated 02/05/2011
vide Annexure R(3)/10 in following terms :-
> "The learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the order dated
> 20/04/2011 has been passed in pursuance to the order passed by the Lokayukt.
> However, as per the reply filed by the respondent, in our opinion, the order
> dated 20/04/2011 be treated as the order passed in pursuance to the
> direction of this Court.
> Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the respondent has
> not taken possession of the land. In reply, the learned counsel for
> respondent submitted that the possession shall be taken immediately, if it
> has not already been taken.
> In view of the aforesaid undertaking given by learned counsel for
> respondent, the contempt petition is disposed of"
4\. The aforesaid order passed in Contempt Petition No.433/2010 reveals that
during pendency of the said case, the Collector Shivpuri, passed the order
dated 20/04/2011(impugned herein) canceling the earlier settlement of Govt.
land in favour of the petitioner thereby paving the way for disposal of the
contempt petition in the aforesaid terms. 4.1. Pertinently, while disposing of
contempt case No.433/2010 the division bench of this Court observed that the
order dated 20/04/2011 passed by Collector Shivpuri (impugned herein ) be
treated as the order passed in pursuance to the order passed in WP
No.2846/2010. 4.2 The Collector on the basis of the report dated 06/10/2010
submitted by SDO, Karera took cognizance of the illegality and rampant
irregularity committed by the then Tehsildaar while passing order dated
30/09/1991  3 WP No.3185/2011 and after hearing the concerned parties pased
the impugned order.
5\. The principal contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is
twofold:-
> (1) The Collector Shivpuri could not have exercise suo motu powers after
> such a long period of time and by doing so it has violated the ratio laid
> down by the Division Bench of this Court in Kamla Singh (Smt.) Vs.Smt. Alka
> Singh and other reported in 2011 MPRN 273 (2) The land in question was
> unoccupied and therefore, was rightly allotted in favour of Hamum Khan.
> (3) No reasonable opportunity of being heard was extended to the petitioner
> before passing of the impugned order.
6\. As regards the first ground of Collector having exercised suo motu powers
with delay and latches, it is seen from the impugned order Annexure P/1 that
the report of the SDO, Karera discovering the illegality in the order dated
30/09/1991 was prepared on 06/10/2010 whereafter the said report was placed
before the Collector who then took cognizance of the said illegality for the
first time on 10/01/2011. Thereafter, the Collector heard the parties
concerned and passed the order dated 20/04/2011 i.e. within three months and
10 days which is within the limits prescribed by the Division Bench of this
Court in Kamla Singh (Supra). Thus, the said ground is of no avail to the
petitioner.
7\. The other ground of the land in question being unoccupied and therefore,
rightly allotted to the predecessor in title of the petitioner is concerned,
it is seen from the record that the Collector found the land to be recorded as
'Pahad' belonging to the Govt. but the then Tehsildaar in connivance with
certain private individuals changed the use of land without following due
process of law and entered the name of predecessor  4 WP No.3185/2011 in title
of the petitioner in the revenue record as bhoomiswami of land in question.
8\. From the finding recorded by the Collector Shivpuri the element of fraud
becomes palpable in the entire transaction which led to passing of the order
by the then Tehsildaar on 30/09/1991. This element of fraud percolates down to
all subsequent transactions which took place pursuant to the order of
Tehsildaar dated 30/09/1991. The order dated 30/03/2011 and its consequential
and subsequent acts of land in question changing hands from Hamum Khan to the
petitioner is vitiated and rendered non-est in the eyes of law.
9\. Fraud is a vice which corrupts and corrodes everything that comes in it's
way. Any order or transaction or procedure executed with the aid of fraud is
rendered ab initio null and void in the eyes of law. Emphasizing the concept
and sweep of fraud, the Apex Court in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Vs. Raj Kumar
Rajinder singh reported in 2018 SCC Online SC 1636 has said thus:
> 70\. Fraud vitiates every solemn proceeding and no right can be claimed by a
> fraudster on the ground of technicalities. On behalf of appellants, reliance
> has been placed on the definition of fraud as defined in the Black's Law
> Dictionary, which is as under:
> 49 "Fraud means: (1) A knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment
> of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment. Fraud
> is usually a tort, but in some cases (esp. when the conduct is willful) it
> may be a crime. (2) A misrepresentation made recklessly without belief in
> its truth to induce another person to act. (3) A tort arising from a knowing
> misrepresentation, concealment of material fact, or reckless
> misrepresentation made to induce another to actto his or her detriment. (4)
> Unconscionable dealing; esp., in contract law, the unconscientious use of
> the power arising out of the parties' relative positions and resulting in an
> unconscionable bargain."
> 71\. Halsbury's Law of England has defined fraud as follows:
5
> WP No.3185/2011 "Whenever a person makes a false statement which he does not
> actually and honestly believe to be true, for purpose of civil liability,
> the statement is as fraudulent as if he had stated that which he did know to
> be true, or know or believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and
> honest belief is all that is necessary to satisfy the requirement of the
> law, whether the representation has been made recklessly or deliberately,
> indifference or reckless on the part of the representor as the truth or
> falsity of the representation affords merely an instance of absence of such
> a belief."
72\. In KERR on the Law of Fraud and Mistake, fraud has been defined thus:
> "It is not easy to give a definition of what constitutes fraud in the
> extensive significance in which that term is understood by Civil Courts of
> Justice. The Courts have always avoided hampering themselves by defining or
> laying down as a general proposition what shall be held to constitute fraud.
> Fraud is infinite in variety... Courts have always declined to define it,
> ... reserving to themselves the liberty to deal with it under whatever form
> it may present itself. Fraud ... may be said to include property all acts,
> omissions, and concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable
> duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or
> by which an undue or unconscientious advantage is taken of another. Al
> surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and other unfair way that is used to
> cheat anyone is considered as fraud. Fraud in all cases implies a willful
> act on the part of anyone, whereby another is sought to be deprived, by
> illegal or inequitable means, of what he is entitled too."
73\. In Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319, wherein it was
observed that fraud vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell
together and it can not be perpetuated or saved by the application of any
equitable doctrine including resjudicata. This Court observed as under:
> "15.Commission of fraud on court and suppression of material facts are the
> core issues involved in these matters. Fraud, as is wellknown, vitiates
> every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell together.
> 16\. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other
> person, or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to
> the conduct of former either by word or letter.
> 17\. It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud.
> Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief
> against fraud.
> 18\. A fraudulent misrepresentation is called  6 WP No.3185/2011 deceit and
> consists in leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him
> to believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes
> representations which he knows to be false, and injury ensues therefrom
> although the motive from which the representations proceeded may not have
> been bad.
> *** *** ***
> 23\. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously. A collusion or
> conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in relation to a
> property would render the transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception
> are synonymous.
> *** *** ***
> 25\. Although in a given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is
> anathema to all equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud
> cannot be perpetuated or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine
> including resjudicata.

74\. In Madhukar Sadbha Shivarkar v. State of Maharashtra, (2015) 6 SCC 557,
this Court observed that fraud had been played by showing the records and the
orders obtained unlawfully by the declarant, would be a nullity in the eye of
law though such orders have attained finality. Following observations were
made:
> "27. The said order is passed by the StateGovernment only to enquire into
> the landholding records with a view to find out as to whether original land
> revenue records have been destroyed and fabricated to substantiate their
> unjustifiable claim by playing fraud upon the Tehsildar and appellate
> authorities to obtain the orders unlawfully in their favour by showing that
> there is no surplus land with the Company and its shareholders as the valid
> subleases are made and they are accepted by them in the proceedings Under
> Section 21 of the Act, on the basis of the alleged false declarations filed
> by the shareholders and sublessees Under Section 6 of the Act. The plea
> urged on behalf of the State Government and the defacto complainantsowners,
> at whose instance the orders are passed by the State Government on the
> alleged ground of fraud played by the declarants upon the Tehsildar and
> appellate authorities to get the illegal orders obtained by them to come out
> from the clutches of the land ceiling provisions of the Act by creating the
> revenue records, which is the fraudulent act on their part which unravels
> everything and therefore, the question of limitation under the provisions to
> exercise power by the State Government does not arise at all. For this
> purpose, the Deputy Commissioner of Pune Division was appointed as the
> Enquiry Officer to hold such an enquiry to enquire into the matter and
> submit  7 WP No.3185/2011 his report for consideration of the Government to
> take further action in the matter. The legal contentions urged by Mr.
> Naphade, in justification of the impugned judgment and order prima facie at
> this stage, we are satisfied that the allegation of fraud in relation to
> getting the land holdings of the villages referred to supra by the
> declarants on the alleged ground of destroying original revenue records and
> fabricating revenue records to show that there are 384 subleases of the land
> involved in the proceedings to retain the surplus land illegally as alleged,
> to the extent of more than 3000 acres of land and the orders are obtained
> unlawfully by the declarants in the land ceiling limits will be nullity in
> the eye of law though such orders have attained finality, if it is found in
> the enquiry by the Enquiry Officer that they are tainted with fraud, the
> same can be interfered with by the State. The landowners are also aggrieved
> parties to agitate their rights to get the orders which are obtained by the
> declarants as they are vitiated in law on account of nullity is the tenable
> submission and the same is well founded and therefore, we accept the
> submission to justify the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench
> of the High Court."

> 75\. In Jai Narain Parasrampuria v. Pushpa Devi Saraf, (2006) 7 SCC 756,
> this Court observed that fraud vitiates every solemn act. Any order or
> decree obtained by practicing fraud is a nullity. This Court held as under:
> "55. It is now well settled that fraud vitiated all solemn act. Any order or
> decree obtained by practicing fraud is a nullity. [See (1) Ram Chandra Singh

> 76\. In State of A.P. v. T. Suryachandra Rao, (2005) 6 SCC 149, it was

> No.3185/2011 of the power to correct the error when the respondent had

> "7. The order of the High Court is clearly erroneous. There is no dispute

> 8\. By "fraud" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any
> expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill will towards
> the other is immaterial. The expression "fraud" involves two elements,

> 22\. It is thus settled proposition of law that a judgment, decree or order

> No.3185/2011 nullity and nonest in the eye of law. Such a judgment, decree

> 38\. The matter can be looked at from a different angle as well. Suppose, a

10.1 Moreso, the ground of quashment of the impugned order merely on the
ground of breach of principle of audi alteram partem would amount to revival
of fraudulent orders and transactions which can never be the object of the
power of judicial review.
11\. Consequently, the present petition having no force is dismissed with
liberty to the petitioner to raise her grievance before the civil Court in
accordance with law.
No cost.
