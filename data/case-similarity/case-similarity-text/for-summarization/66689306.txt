    Final Order No.    20142-20145 / 2017 
    Per : S.S GARG 
The present four appeals have been filed by the appellant against the common
impugned order dated 18.4.2013 passed by the Commissioner (A) whereby the
Commissioner (A) has partly allowed the appeals of the appellant and allowed
the refund in respect of few input services and held that appellants are not
eligible for refund of unutilized service tax credit in respect of banking and
financial services; cleaning activity; consulting engineering; outdoor
catering, air travel agents, printer rental charges, reinforcement sprips lab
charges, projector hire charges business auxiliary service, management
consultancy. The various refund claims filed by the appellants are shown in
the table below:
Appeal No. Period Refund Amount E/27243/2013 Jan.  Dec. 08 Rs.27,46,468/-
E/27244/2013 Apr.  Jun. 09 Rs.4,27,665/-
E/27245/2013 Jul.  Sep. 09 Rs.3,89,398/-
E/27246/2013 Jn.  Mar. 09 Rs.52,47,873/-
2\. Briefly the facts of the case are that the appellant is primarily engaged
in the manufacture of aircraft components and rendering engineering design
services using information technology software. The manufacturing portions are
carried out from 100% EOU and the engineering design services are rendered
from a unit registered under the Software Technology Park of India.
Accordingly, the appellant has obtained registration under the Central Excise
Act for EOU unit and under Finance Act primarily for the STP unit. The goods
manufactured and engineering design services rendered are exported outside
India. In the course of manufacture of aircraft parts and rendering
engineering design services, appellant consumed various input services and
they are unable to utilize the credit of input services availed under the
CENVAT Credit Rules, therefore they have preferred refund claims for different
periods as shown in the table with the Customs Department for the
manufacturing division and with the service tax authorities for engineering
designs services. After following the due process, the Assistant Commissioner
vide different Orders-in-Original rejected the refund claims primarily on the
ground that the services on which refund is claimed are related to business
expenses and are not used in the manufacture of export of goods. Aggrieved by
the said orders, the appellant filed appeals before the Commissioner (A), and
the Commissioner (A) vide Order-in-Appeal dated 18.4.2013 allowed the appeals
in respect of certain services and rejected the appeals with respect to few
other services on the ground that there is no nexus between the input services
and the manufacturing of goods exported. Aggrieved by the said order, the
appellant filed the present appeals.
3\. The learned consultant appearing for the appellant submitted that the
impugned order rejecting the refund on few input services on lack of nexus is
not sustainable in law and is against the correct interpretation of input
service definition as contained in Rule 2(l) of CCR, 2004 and also against
the various decisions rendered by the higher judicial fora where all the
services have been specifically held to be input services. The definition of
input service as contained in Rule 2(l) is reproduced herein below.
(l) "input service" means any service,-
(i) used by a provider of taxable service for providing an output service; or
(ii) used by the manufacturer, whether directly or indirectly, in or in
relation to the manufacture of final products and clearance of final products
upto the place of removal, and includes services used in relation to setting
up, modernization, renovation or repairs of a factory, premises of provider of
output service or an office relating to such factory or premises,
advertisement or sales promotion, market research, storage upto the place of
removal, procurement of inputs, activities relating to business, such as
accounting, auditing, financing, recruitment and quality control, coaching and
training, computer networking, credit rating, share registry, and security,
inward transportation of inputs or capital goods and outward transportation
upto the place of removal;
3.1 He further submitted that during the relevant period, the definition of
input service has been given wide interpretation by various courts. In the
case of CCE vs. Ultratech Cements reported in 2010-TIOL-745-CESTAT-MUM, the
Bombay High Court held that the definition of input service is very wide and
not only covers services used directly or indirectly used in or in relation to
the manufacture of final products but also includes other services which have
direct nexus with the manufacture of final products. With regard to each
service, the learned consultant has given the usage of the said services along
with case laws to show that the said service fall in the definition of input
service and has actually been used for rendering export services as well as
for manufacturing of the goods exported.
