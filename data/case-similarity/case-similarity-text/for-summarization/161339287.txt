E R Per Shamim Yahya, AM These are appeal by the assessee against respective
orders of learned CIT(A) u/s 195(1), 195(2) and 201 r.w.s. 201(1A) for
assessment year 2004-2005. Since grounds and issues are common, we are
adjudicating the issue by referring to facts and figures from ITA
No.3819/Mum/2014.
2\. The grounds of appeal read as under:-
> Ground No. 1: Remittances of Purchase of software not taxable in India
> 1\. The Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals)-lO ["the CIT(A)"]erred in
> holding that payment of US$ 1,36,832.23 and US$ 1,23,229.02 made towards
> purchase of software , to Apex  2 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
> M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
Systems P. Ltd., Singapore ("Apex") as a royalty payment, requiring tax
deduction at source @ 15%.
2\. He further erred in holding that such payments are nothing but
consideration for license to use a software and hence covered by the
definition of royalty both under section 9(l)(vi) of the Income tax Act, 1961
as well as under Article 12 of India- Singapore Tax Treaty for Avoidance of
Double Taxation.
3\. He further erred in concluding that selling or giving on hire of the
software or offering for sale or for commercial rental any copy of the
computer program regardless of whether such a copy has been sold or given on
hire on earlier occasion constitute the grant of a right to use copyrights
4\. He further erred in concluding that use of software program on computer
will amount to transfer of copyright under section 14 of the copyright Act
since the buyer of software makes use of the copyright contained in the said
software purchased and the same would amount to transfer of part of the
copyright.
5\. He further erred in concluding that the definition of Article 12(3) of the
Treaty is wider than that contained in the Income Tax Act 1961 as it also
ropes in payment of consideration for the use of a copyright in addition to
the consideration paid for the right to use a copyright, covered by the
definition in the Act.
6\. He further erred in applying newly inserted explanation 4 to section
9(l)(vi) of the Act for payments made in FY 2003-04 without appreciating the
fact that a retrospective amendment in law cannot change the tax withholding
liability, with retrospective effect
7\. He failed to appreciate and ought to have held that a. The licence is non-
transferable and non-exclusive b. The Appellant is given a licence to use the
software only for use in the ordinary course of its own life insurance
business i.e. self-use and not for commercial exploitation.
3 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
c. There is a prohibition against the Appellant reverse engineering or using
undocumented facilities to enable development capability of the software
product.
d. The licence granted to the Appellant is personal to it and the Appellant is
not entitled to sell, licence, sub-licence, lease or assign the software to
any third party, except users of the customer, without written consent of
Apex.
e. Since the programmes from Apex have been obtained in the form of CDs, it
would be considered as purchase of "goods" and the amount paid by the
appellant to Apex can be regarded only as "Business Profits" and not as
"Royalty."
f. The Appellant has acquired from Apex only a copy-righted article for use in
its own business and has not obtained any copyright as it has not acquired any
right to reproduce or to distribute and to sell the software acquired by it
from Apex .
g. The fact that the Appellant has no right to replicate or to sell the
licenced software shows that the licence obtained by the Appellant cannot be
regarded as the acquisition of a copyright under the Copyright Act, 1957.
h. There is no transfer of any rights including granting of license in respect
of property and cannot be considered to have been transferred even though
license is granted in respect of such rights. The rights of various payments
remain protected and cannot be considered to have been transferred or even a
license is granted in respect of such rights. What the Appellant ultimately
paid is for use of a copyrighted article and not received any right in the
copyright.
i. the payments for use of copyrighted software (as in the instant case) is
distinguished from payments for use of copyrights in the software.
j. payments for the rights in relation to the acts of copying, where they do
no more than enable the effective operation by the user, will not be
characterised as Royalty.
4 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
k. The tax withholding obligations from payments to non- residents, as set out
in Section 195, require that the person making the payment "at the time of
credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment
thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode,
whichever is earlier, deduct income -tax thereon at the rates in force". When
these obligations are to be discharged at the point of time when payment is
made or credited, whichever is earlier, such obligations can only be
discharged in the light of the law as it stands that point of time
8\. The Appellant prays that it be held that payment of US$ 1,36,832.23 and
US$ 1,23,229.02 to Apex towards purchase of software are in the nature of
Copyrighted Article and are not "royalty" , both under section 9(l)(vi) of the
Income tax Act, 1961 as well as under Article 12 of India-Singapore Tax Treaty
for Avoidance of Double Taxation and require no deduction of tax at source.
Ground No.2: Payments towards Annual Maintenance Charges
1\. CIT (A) erred in holding that payment of US$ 31,400.67 made towards
Maintenance Charges for the software, to Apex as a "Fees for Technical
Services (FTS)" payment, requiring tax deduction at source @ 15%.
2\. He further erred in holding that such payments are nothing but Technical
and/or consultancy service and hence covered by the definition of FTS both
under section 9(l)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1961 as well as under Article
12 of India- Singapore Tax Treaty for Avoidance of Double Taxation.
3\. He further erred in holding that such maintenance services are ancillary
and subsidiary to the application or enjoyment of any right property or
information (Software Licence) for which a payment described Article 12(3) is
received i.e Royalty and hence FTS under Article 12(4)(a) of the Tax treaty.
5 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
4\. He failed to appreciate and ought to have held that a. The Services were
simply software maintenance services which did not involve any transfer of
Technology.
b. Unless there was a transfer of technology involved in technical services
extended by apex Singapore, the 'make available' clause was not satisfied and,
accordingly, the consideration for such services could not be taxed as FTS
under Article 12(4) of India Singapore tax treaty.
c. the amount paid by the appellant to Apex can be regarded only as "Business
Profits" and not as "FTS" and in absence of any Permanent Establishment of
Apex in India, the same cannot be taxed in India.
5\. The Appellant prays that it be held that payment of US$ 31,400,67 to Apex
towards Maintenance Charges are not "FTS " , both under section 9(l)(vii) of
the Income tax Act, 1961 as well as under Article 12 of India-Singapore Tax
Treaty for Avoidance of Double Taxation and are in nature of in the nature of
"Business Profit" covered under article 7 of India-Singapore Tax Treaty
require no deduction of tax at source in absence of any PE of Apex in India.
Ground No.3: Interest U/s. 201(1A)
1\. The AO erred in charging the interest under section 201(1A) on short
deduction of TDS.
2\. He failed to appreciate and ought to have held that there is no short
deduction/payment of TDS in the case of the Appellant since the payments are
not liable to TDS.
3\. The Appellant prays that it is not liable for interest under section
201(1A) and AO be directed to delete the interest under section 201(1A).
4\. Without prejudice to the above, AO be directed to recalculate the interest
U/s. 201(1A) consequent to the any relief granted on any of the grounds stated
above.

M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
The Appellant craves leave to add, alter and/or amend the aforesaid Grounds of
Appeal at or before the time of hearing.
3\. Brief facts of the case are as under :-
> The assessee Company is engaged in the business of life insurance. The
> assessee Company has procured, software for the administration of various
> life insurance policies from a Singapore Company called Apex Systems P Ltd.
> ("Apex") and entered into an agreement with Apex on 1.10. 2001.
> Under this Agreement, the following three types of payments were made by the
> Appellant to Apex:
> (a) a licence to use the software package developed by Apex, for which the
> assessee was to pay Apex a licence fee;
> (b) maintenance of the software package by resolving queries and problems

> interest of Rs.5,95,791 was also levied u/s. 201(1A) of the Act."
4\. Upon assessee's appeal, learned CIT(A) elaborately considered the issue.
He inter alia referred to several Hon'ble Karnataka High Court decisions and
concluded that the amount paid was royalty payment u/s 9(1)(vi) and Article
12(3) of the Tax Treaty with Singapore requiring the assessee to deduct tax at
source at the rate of 15%. As regards the maintenance charges paid for the
software purchase, he linked the same to the payment for software being
royalty payment and held the same to be fee for technical services and
affirmed the Assessing Officer's action.
5\. Against the above order assessee is in appeal before us.
6\. We have heard both the Counsel and perused the records. The arguments of
both the Counsel are the same as in the case of M/s.Kotak Mahindra Bank
Limited v. ITO in ITA No.2536/Mum/2008, heard by this Bench on the same day.
8 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
7\. Both the Counsels also agreed that the facts are also similar. We find
that in the said case vide order dated 22 n d May, 2017, we had adjudicated
the issue as under:-
> "5. We have heard both the Counsels and perused the records. Learned Counsel
> of the assessee submitted that the amount paid is not a royalty both under
> the Income-tax Act as well as Indo-Japan DTAA. He submitted that assessee
> has been granted limited use of the software for own internal purposes.
> There is complete prohibition for making copy for sale or transferring it to
> others. Furthermore, learned Counsel placed reliance upon several case laws
> for the proposition that similar issue has been decided in favour of the
> assessee. For this proposition, he placed reliance upon following case
> laws:-
> (i) Reliance Industries Ltd. ITA Nos.1980, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1986, 2523,

(xi) Quaocomm India (P) Ltd. [2017] 77 taxmann.com 213 (Hyderabad Tribunal)
6\. Further, learned Counsel submitted that this payment for software was not
under the ambit of definition of royalty as per the extant provisions of
section 9(1)(vi). He submitted that Explanation 4 to this section has been
inserted by the Finance Act, 2012 with retrospective effect. He submitted that
this Explanation seeks to bring software such as the one falling under the
present appeal under the ambit of royalty. Learned Counsel submitted that this
Explanation was not there when the assessee's liability to deduct tax at
source arose. He submitted that a subsequent amendment cannot fasten liability
on the assessee from retrospective effect, hence he submitted that assessee is
not at all liable to deduct tax at source from the payment made for software.
7\. Per contra, learned Departmental Representative submitted that although
there is Delhi High Court decision in favour of the assessee, he claimed that
there are several Hon'ble Karnataka High Court decisions which are in favour
of the Revenue. He furthermore submitted that if ambulatory approach is
applied Explanation 4 to section 9(1)(vi) supports the case of the Revenue. He
submitted that in some other decisions, Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court has
favoured ambulatory approach. As against this, he submitted that Hon'ble Delhi
High Court has applied static approach under which domestic law at the time of
entering of the DTAA is applied and not the domestic law as prevailing as
which the ambulatory approach mandates.
8\. We have carefully considered the submissions and perused the records. We
find that learned Counsel of the assessee has referred to several case laws of
various benches  10 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014. M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old
Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
of the Tribunal, wherein similar issue was decided in favour of the assessee.
Furthermore, the same Bench of the Tribunal as the present one in the case of
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. v. DDIT in ITA No.7735/Mum/2011 vide
order dated 18.05.2017 has considered identical issue. The Tribunal had
extensively referred to the decision of the Tribunal in the case of ADIT (IT)
v. First Advantage (P.) Ltd. [(2017) 77 taxmann.com 195 (Mumbai-Trib.)].
Further the Tribunal in the case of National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
(supra) had also referred to decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court and
Karnataka High Court, and concluded as under:-
"15. In this regard we may also refer to Hon'ble Delhi High Court exposition
on this subject in the case of DIT vs Ericsson AB 343 ITR 470 as under:
"That in order to qualify as royalty payment, within the meaning of section
9(1)(vi) and particularly clause (v) of Explanation 2 there to, it is
necessary to establish that there is transfer of all or any rights (including
the granting of any licence) in respect of copyright of a literary, artistic
or scientific work. Section 2(0) of the Copyright Act, 1957, makes it clear
that a computer programme is to be regarded as a literary work. Thus, in order
to treat the consideration paid by the cellular operator as royalty, it is to
be established that the cellular operator, by making such payment, obtains all
or any of the copyright rights of such literary work. This was not
established. It was not even the case of the Revenue that any right
contemplated' under section 14 of the 1957 Act stood vested in the cellular
operator as a consequence of article 20 of the supply contract. Distinction
has to be made between the acquisition of a "copyright right" and a
"copyrighted article." Even assuming that the payments made by the cellular
operator were regarded as a payment by way of royalty as defined in
Explanation 2 below section 9(1)(vi), nevertheless, it could never be regarded
as royalty within the meaning of the term in article 13, paragraph (3) of the
DT AA. This is so because the definition in the DTAA is narrower than the
definition in the Act. Article 13(3) brings within the ambit of the definition
of royalty a payment made for the use of or the right to use a  11 ITA
Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014. M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance
Limited.
copyright of a literary work. Therefore, what is contemplated is a payment
that is dependent upon the user of the copyright and not a lump sum payment as
was the position in the present case. Once the payment in question was not
royalty which would come within the mischief of clause (vi) the Explanation to
section 9(1) would have no application. The payment received by the assessee
was towards the title and GSM system of which soft- ware was an inseparable
part incapable of independent use and it was a contract for supply of goods.
Therefore, no part of the payment, therefore could be classified as payment
towards royalty."
16\. From the above case laws it is amply clear that it has been held that the
software sold by M/s. Minitab Inc USA to the assessee fell into the category
of "copyrighted article" against acquisition of "copyright" which qualified as
royalty payment. Furthermore Hon'ble Delhi High Court had held that even if
the item was regarded as royalty payment as defined in explanation to Section
9(1)(vi) nevertheless the DTAA would prevail where royalty is dependent upon
the use of the copyrights and not a lump sum as was in the present case. That
once the payment in question was not royalty which would, within the mischief
of clause (vi) the explanation to section 9 (1) would have no application.
17\. In this regard we have noted that Hon'ble Karnataka High Court has taken
a contrary view as under in the case of CIT vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
(Supra). (Head notes only) "The assessee imported "shrink-wrapped"/ "off-the-
shelf" software from suppliers in foreign countries and made payment for the
same without deducting tax at source u/s 195. The AO & CIT (A) held that the
payments were assessable to tax as "royalty" u/s 9(1)(vi)/ Article 12 and that
the assessee was liable to pay the tax u/s 201. On appeal, the Tribunal relied
on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Tata Consultancy Services vs. State
of AP 271 ITR 401 (SC) and held that the assessee had acquired a "copyrighted
article" but not the "copyright" itself and so the amount paid was not
assessable as "royalty". On appeal by the department, HELD reversing the
Tribunal:
12 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
(i) U/s 9(1)(vi) of the Act & Article 12 of the DTAA, "payments of any kind in
consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of a
literary, artistic or scientific work" is deemed to be "royalty". Under the
Copyright Act, 1957, a software programme constitutes a "copyright". A right
to make a copy of the software and use it for internal business by making copy
of the same and storing it on the hard disk amounts to a use of the copyright
u/s 14 (1) of that Act because in the absence of such a licence, there would
have been an infringement of the copyright. Accordingly, the argument that
there is no transfer of any part of the copyright and the transaction involves
only a sale of a copyrighted article is not acceptable. The amount paid to the
supplier for supply of the "shrink-wrapped" software is not the price of the
CD alone nor software alone nor the price of licence granted. It is a
combination of all. In substance unless a licence was granted permitting the
end user to copy and download the software, the CD would not be helpful to the
end user;
(ii) There is a difference between a purchase of a book or a music CD because
while these can be used once they are purchased, software stored in a dumb CD
requires a license to enable the user to download it upon his hard disk, in
the absence of which there would be an infringement of the owner's copyright.
(TCS vs. State of AP distinguished as being in the context of sales-tax);"
18\. We have also noted the submission of the Ld. DR that the seller of the
software has a copyright upon it. That distinction between copyright and
copyrighted article was originally coined by the US Internal Revenue Service.
He had also submitted that this interpretation is supportive of internal
revenue of the USA as majority of the software and the copyrights originate
from USA. By terming such transfer of software which are under copyright in
the USA as copyrighted article the software sellers of the USA where taken out
of the ambit of taxation of the other countries which were
purchasing/acquiring the software. Furthermore Ld. Counsel of the assessee has
pleaded that after the insertion of explanation iv to Section 9(i)(iv), this
software sale has also come under the ambit of royalty. However Hon'ble Delhi
High Court has applied the static  13 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
approach under which domestic law as at the time of the entering of the DTAA
is applied and not the domestic law as prevailing as which the ambulatory
approaches mandates. He has further submitted that eminent author Klaus vogel
has also favoured the ambulatory approach. He has further mentioned the
Hon'ble jurisdictional Bombay High Court has also favoured ambulatory approach
in some other decisions. We also note the Ld. CIT-A has referred to a decision
of Federal Court of Australia in the case of IBM vs. CIT (supra) which held
that similar payment by IBM Australia to IBM USA under similar DTAA was
royalty payment.
19\. We have carefully considered the above. However we find that admittedly
there is no direct jurisdictional High Court decision on the subject. However
there is a direct Hon'ble Delhi High Court decision which is in favour of the
assessee. As against this there are decisions of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court
which are in favour of revenue. In this regard we note that Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of vegetable products 88 ITR 192 had held that if two
constructions are possible one in favour of the assessee should be adopted.
Accordingly respectfully following the precedent we follow the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court decision. Accordingly we set aside the order of authority below. We
hold that the transfer / sale of software in this case is not taxable as
royalty. Hence the assessee was not liable to deduct tax at source u/s 195 of
the Income-tax Act, before remitting the money to the US supplier."
9\. Now we examine the present case on the touchstone of above said decisions.
In this case we find that assessee has purchased software from overseas
supplier from Japan. As per the terms of purchase assessee is entitled to make
copies of the same for its internal use. It cannot be copied and sold. In this
factual background the A.O. and the learned CIT(A) are of the opinion that the
purchase of software comes under the ambit of Royalty as per Section 9(1)(vi).
However, assessee's plea is that the said software is a copyrighted article as
distinct from copyright on which royalty is payable. Learned DR has submitted
that by way of insertion of Explanation 4 to Section 9(1)(vi), article such as
the present one have also come under  14 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014.
M/s.Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
the ambit of Royalty with retrospective effect. As against this it is the plea
of the Counsel of the assessee that this purchase does not come under the
ambit of Royalty as per section 9(1)(vi) inasmuch as the software involved is
a copyrighted article which cannot be said to be coming under the ambit of
Royalty. Assessee's plea is that it is settled law that the provisions of
double taxation avoidance agreement take precedence over the domestic laws.
Even if it is accepted that as per the present domestic law the software
purchase comes under the ambit of Royalty payment, the same does not fall
under the purview of Royalty as per the double taxation avoidance agreement.
Hence, it is the plea of the assessee that provisions of the double taxation
avoidance agreement will prevail and the software purchase will not come under
the ambit of Royalty payment u/s 9(1)(vi).
10\. We find that the submission of the assessee and its Counsel find support
from the decisions of Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the ITAT decision as above.
Accordingly, respectfully following the precedence, we are of the considered
opinion that the transfer / sale of software in this case is not taxable as
Royalty. Hence the assessee was not liable to deduct tax at source u/s 195 of
the Income-tax Act before remitting money for the purchase.
11\. There is another limb to the learned Counsel of the assessee's argument.
He has submitted that even if it is considered that this software purchase
comes under the ambit of royalty as per Explanation 4 to section 9(1)(vi), the
said Explanation was inserted with retrospective effect by Finance Act, 2012.
He said that by no stretch of imagination assessee can be said to have
envisaged at the time when its liability to deduct tax at source arose that
subsequently a retrospective amendment would come into force. We find
considerable cogency in the submission of the learned Counsel of the assessee
Even if upon application of Explanation 4 to section 9(1)(vi), it is
considered that the payment was royalty, it cannot be said that assessee could
have anticipated insertion of Explanation 4 with retrospective effect at an
earlier date. It is  15 ITA Nos.3819, 3820 & 3821/Mum/2014. M/s.Kotak Mahindra
Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited.
settled law that nobody can be expected to do the impossible. Hence it was not
possible for the assessee to foresee a retrospective Explanation so as to
fasten upon it the liability to deduct tax at source in this case. The
assessee succeeds on this limb of the argument also.
12\. In the result, this appeal filed by the assessee stands allowed."
8\. Since facts are identical, following the above order, we set aside the
orders of authorities below and hold that the payment was not royalty and
hence assessee was not liable to deduct tax at source.
9\. In the result, these appeals filed by the assessee stand allowed.
