3\. The aforesaid revised grounds of appeal can be conveniently decided
together with the grounds raised by the revenue which read as follows :-
3 4 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
> M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 "1. Whether on the basis of facts and in circumstances of the
> instant case, the Ld. DRP, Kolkata has erred in directing to allow foreign
> exchange loss as non- operating income for the purpose of computation of

> 2\. Whether on the basis of facts and in circumstances of the instant case,
> the Ld. DRP, Kolkata has erred in directing to allow bad debts as non-

> (PLI) of the comparables without appreciating the facts in case to case
> basis as to whether bad debts has arisen in the normal course of business
> and not resulted from speculative transaction or otherwise.
> 3\. The appellant craves leave to amend, modify or alter any grounds of
> appeal during the course of hearing of this case."
4\. The aforesaid grounds of appeal are with reference to the determination of
Arms Length Price (ALP) in respect of an international taxation between the
assessee and its Associated Enterprises (AE). The Assessee is a company. It is
engaged in the business of rendering software development services. The
Assessee renders services to Anshin Software Corporation, USA incorporated as
a company under the laws of California, USA. In fact the assessee is a captive
service for Anshin Software Corporation, USA. It is not in dispute that the
assessee and Anshin Software Corporation, USA are associated enterprises
because of common share holding in both the companies by Shri Arnab Debnath
and Miss Mausumi .Debnath. The assessee received a sum of Rs.13,37,18,400/-
for rendering software development services to Anshin Software Corporation,
USA. Under the provision of section 92 of the Act, any income arising out of
an international taxation has to be computed having regard to the Arms length
price. Under section 92F(ii) of the Act Arms Length Price means a price which
would be charged between persons if they are not associated enterprises and
there are no uncontrolled conditions prevailing with reference to the
transactions. It is not in dispute that the provision of section 92 of the Act
are applicable in respect of the transactions of  4 5 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 rendering services of software development services by the
assessee to its associated enterprises and therefore the provision of section
92 of the Act are applicable.
5\. To justify the price received by the assessee as one at arm's length, the
assessee filed a transfer pricing analysis in which the assessee adopted
operating profit to operating cost (OP/OC) as profit level indicator(PLI). The
operating profit to operating cost of the assessee was determined at 21.64%.
The assessee adopted Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as the most
appropriate method for determining the arms length price. The assessee on an
analysis of similar companies, who are engaged in providing software
development services, identified 21 companies as comparable with the Assessee.
The assessee took the weighted average of operating profit to operating cost
of the 21 comparable companies so selected for three financial years, viz.,
2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10. By doing so the assessee arrived at an average
OP/OC i.e., arithmetic mean of 6.54% of 21 comparable companies. Since the
assessee's operating profit/operating cost was 21.64%, the assessee claimed
that the transactions with the associated enterprises was at arms length. The
profit margin of the comparable companies chosen by the assessee in its
transfer pricing study is as follows :-
5 6 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
6\. The AO made a reference u/s 92CA (1) of the Act to the Transfer Pricing
Officer for determination of arms length price in respect of the international
transaction between the assessee and its associated enterprises. The TPO vide
its order dated 30.01.2014 passed 92CA(3) of the Act, firstly accepted the
Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as the most appropriate method of
determining arms length price of the international taxation. He however,
rejected the action of the Asseessee in adopting the weighted average of three
financial years operating profit to operating cost to arrive at the profit
margins (arithmetic mean) of the comparable companies. He held that multiple
year data cannot be used for comparison purpose and it was only the data of
the relevant previous year that has to be used in arriving at the arithmetic
mean of profit margin of the comparable companies. The TPO thereafter rejected
20 out of 21 companies chosen by the assessee i.e., except the company Global
services Ltd., chosen by the Assessee in its Transfer Pricing Analysis, all
other companies chosen as comparable companies by the Assessee were rejected
as not comparable with the business profile of the assessee. The TPO on his
own identified eight more companies as comparable companies of the assessee
and arrived at the operating profit to operating cost of these companies and
determined the arms length price of the international taxation as follows :-
(Quote from AO's order) "19. The list of final comparables selected by the
TPO, along with the margins is as follows :
6 7 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
20\. Therefore the calculation of the adjustment in the case of the assessee
is as follows :
21\. Since the adjustment is less than +/-5% limit, in view of the facts of
the case, upper Adjustment is proposed to be made to the total income of the
assessee.
22\. It is hereby clarified that the findings and discussions made in this
order are applicable only in respect to reference received for A.V 2010-11 and
shall apply accordingly.
(TOTAL UPWARD ADJUSTMENTIN RESPECT OF MARKET SUPPORT SERVICE: Rs
2,15,52,333/-)"

M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
7\. Aggrieved by the determination of the arms length price by the APO as
above the assessee filed objections before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP).
The DRP gave relief to the assessee by directing the TPO to consider foreign
exchange gain as part of the operating income while computing operating
profit/operating cost. Similarly the DRP also directed that the bad debts
written off should also be considered as an operating expenditure while
arriving at the Profit level indicator of the comparable and arrived at the
operating profit/operating cost of the comparables. In respect of the foresaid
two directions of the DRP, which was incorporated by the AO in the impugned
order, the revenue is in appeal before the Tribunal in its appeal. Aggrieved
by the action of the DRP in not rejecting the comparables chosen by the TPO
and also excluding some of the comparables chosen by the assessee in its TP
analysis and not allowing the working capital adjustment and other risk
adjustment and not excluding interest income while computing the operating
profit/operating cost of comparables vz., Kuliza Technologies Ltd. And Inteq
Sofware Pvt. Ltd., the assessee has raised grounds no.1 to 16 before the
Tribunal. We will deal with all the grounds in seriatim in the following
paragraphs.
8\. As far as Ground No.1(a) raised by the assessee in its appeal is
concerned, the assessee is aggrieved by the action of DRP/AO in not including
Akshay Software Technologies Ltd., in the final list of comparables chosen by
the TPO. We have already seen that the assessee had chosen a set of 21
comparable companies and adopted the average of those companies operating
profit /operating cost to arrive at the arithmetic mean of the comparable
companies. One such company chosen by the assessee in its transfer pricing
study was Akshay Software Technologies Ltd.. The TPO was of the view that the
aforesaid company cannot be considered as a comparable company for the reason
that the related party transaction carried out by this company during the
relevant financial year and other data available for the purpose of carrying
out comparability analysis properly, was insufficient.
8 9 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
9\. Before the DRP the assessee demonstrated the existence of all the relevant
data so far as this comparable company chosen by the assessee is concerned.
The DRP was convinced with the arguments of the assessee and at page 19 of its
order directed the TPO to consider the aforesaid company as a comparable
company. The following were the relevant observations of the TPO :-
> "The same are being considered in respect of Akash Software Technologies
> Ltd. The AO has not given detailed reasons for holding that this company was
> functionally non-comparable. It is seen from its annual report that this
> company has revenue primarily from software services and only .07% revenue
> is earned from sale of products. Further this company has been taken as
> comparable in the case of SDS and has similar activities to that of
> E-Infochips Pvt. Ltd which has been taken by the TPO as comparable. The TPO
> is accordingly directed to include this company as a comparable provided it
> qualifies all other filters adopted by the TPO."
10\. It can be seen from the aforesaid directions of the DRP that instead of
mentioning Akshay Software Technologies Ltd., the DRP has given a different
name Akash Software Technologies Ltd. For this reason the AO in the order
giving effect to the directions of the DRP had not considered Akshay Software
Technologies Ltd., as a comparable company. The assessee filed an application
u/s 154 of the Act dated 13.05.2015 before DRP pointing out this apparent
error. The DRP has however not acted on this application. The ld. DR submitted
the functional profile of this company has not been considered by DRP. We are
of the view that the DRP has considered the functional profile. Besides this
the issue is not with regard to the comparability of functional profile of the
assessee and Akshay Software Technologies Ltd. The issue is whether Akshay
Software Technologies Ltd has been wrongly mentioned as Akash Software
Technologies Ltd., in the directions of DRP. On a reading of the order of the
DRP and the contentions of the assessee, it is clear that DRP has wrongly
mentioned the name of Akshay Software Technologies Ltd., as Akash Software
Technologies Ltd. Therefore ground no.1(a) raised by the assessee is allowed
and the AO is directed to  9 10 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research
Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 consider Akshay Software Technologies Ltd as a comparable company
in the final set of comparables.
11\. As far as ground no.1(b) raised by the assessee is concerned, the same
relates to including interest income of comparable companies Kuliza
Technologies Ltd., and Inteq Software Ltd., while working out the operating
profit/operating cost of these comparable companies. As far as this objection
is concerned the DRP dealt with the same in page 29 of its order at para 8.2
as follows :-
> "8.2. This issue has been considered. The TPO is directed to consider
> foreign exchange gains as operating income. However one time or extra-
> ordinary expenses like Extra Ordinary Bad Debt like in the case of Kuliza
> Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Needs to be excluded therefore the action of the TPO
> to this extent is upheld. The contention of the assessee regarding interest
> income as non-operating is found to be not correct therefore the objection
> of the assessee is accepted. The TPO is accordingly directed to recompute
> the PLI of Kuliza Technologies Pvt. Ltd following these directions."
12\. A reading of the order of the DRP clearly shows that the DRP has agreed
with the contention of the assessee that interest income is not an operating
income but the use of the word "not correct" and the use of the words
"therefore the objection of the Assessee is accepted" shows that there is
contradiction. On the issue whether interest income can be considered as part
of operating profit, we find that the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
Marubeni India Pvt. Ltd. Vs DIT in IT No.1042 of 2011 judgment dated
25.04.2013 has held that interest income earned from investments on surplus
funds which are not required immediately for the business of the assessee
cannot be considered to be part of its operating income. Apart from the above
it is also seen that at page 8 para 5.2, the TPO himself in the last sentence
has set out what are not operating income and has given some examples. One
such example of income which is not operating in nature as set out by the TPO
himself is interest income. It thus appears that even the TPO accepted the
fact that the interest income in question cannot form part of  10 11 ITA
Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies
Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 the operating income of the assessee for the purpose of working
operating profit to operating cost. Keeping in mind, the above circumstances
and the judicial precedent set out above, we are of the view that the interest
income in question should be excluded while working out operating profit to
operating cost of the aforesaid two comparable companies Kuliza Technologies
Pvt. Ltd., and Inteq Software Ltd. This finding is without prejudice to the
comparability of Inteq Software Ltd., which is challenged by the Assessee in
Gr.No.6 before us.
13\. Grounds No.2 and 3 raised by the assessee are general in nature and calls
for no specific adjudication.
14\. Ground No.4 was not pressed by the ld. Counsel for the assesee.
15\. As far as ground no.5 is concerned, the admitted position of law is that
multiple data cannot be used in the transfer pricing analysis as per the law
as it stood at the relevant point of time in A.Y.2010-11. Rule 10B(4) of the
Income Tax Rules, 1962 (Rules) provides that the data to be used in analysing
the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with an international
transaction shall be the data relating to the financial year in which the
international transaction has been entered into. This being the admitted
position, we are of the view that there is no merit in ground no.5 raised by
the assessee and we hold that for the purpose of comparability, multiple year
data i.e., the weighted average of three financial years of the comparable
companies cannot be used in TP Analysis as per the laws that existed for AY
2010-11.
16\. As far as ground no.6 raised by the assessee is concerned, the same is
with regard to the action of the TPO and the DRP in accepting E-Infochips
Bangalore Limited and Inteq Software Limited as comparable companies with that
of the assessee. As far as the aforesaid companies are concerned the facts are
that admittedly the information  11 12 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura
Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 regarding the financial statement of these two companies were not
available in the public domain and the AO obtained the details about the
financial results of these two companies by issuing notices u/s 133(6) of the
Act to these two companies. At the time of hearing the ld. Counsel for the
assessee brought to our notice that E-Infochips Bangalore Limited was not
considered as a comparable company by the Hon'ble ITAT in the case of another
software development services company such as the assessee and that order of
the tribunal is also in relation to A.Y.2010-11. Our attention was drawn to
the decision of ITAT, Kolkata in the case of Lab Vantage Solution Pvt. Ltd.,
in ITA No.1051/Kol/2015 in para 8.2. order dated 19.10.2016 wherein the
tribunal held that this company cannot be compared with a software service
provider as this company was into both the business of Software Development
Services (IT) as well as providing Information Technology Enabled Services
(ITES) and also for the reason that segmental details of IT and ITES were not
available. The following were the relevant observations of the Tribunal:-
> "8.3. Exclusion of Infinite Date Systems Pvt. Ltd. (Merged) We find that
> this company had reported NCP of 88.25%. It is not in dispute that the
> assessee is engaged in software development. Hence, comparable should also
> be in the companies engaged in the similar section. We find that this
> company is having a different business model and engaged in providing entire
> gamut of solutions comprising of technical consulting, design and
> development of software, maintenance, system integration, implementation,
> testing and infrastructure management services. We find from the paper book
> that the Revenue is primarily derived from technical support and
> infrastructure management services. We find that Infinite Date Systems Pvt.
> Ltd. commenced its operation on 1st January, 2009 and as per segment
> reporting disclosure, the company's operations predominantly relate to
> providing software technical consultancy services to its sole customer
> Fujitsu Services Limited. Further, as per the Annual Report of 2009, at Page
> 1, it is stated that the Holding Company M/s Infinite Computer Solutions
> ((India) Limited signed an agreement (Build, Operate and Transfer - BOT
> Model) with Fujitsu Services Limited to set up Global Delivery Centers in
> India to provide offshore delivery capabilities to Fujitsu & Fujitsu's
> associated companies. We find that these facts have also been acknowledged
> by the Ld. TPO at page 77 of his order. The Ld. AR stated that it would be
> worthwhile to note that Infinite Date Systems Pvt. Ltd. completed its three
> years contract with Fujitsu, post which, the business  12 13 ITA
> Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies
> Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 was transferred to Fujitsu and thus the company has been merged
with its Holding Company- Infinite Computer Solutions (India) Ltd. during the
financial year 2011-
12\. We are inclined to agree with the submissions of the Ld. AR that this
Comparable Infinite Date Systems Pvt. Ltd. was created for purpose of transfer
of business. Hence, the nature of services and business model of assessee
company and comparable company are entirely different. Apart from this, we
also find that there exist abnormal circumstances in the said comparable.
During the last 3 years, variations in margins earned show an abnormal
circumstances leading to huge fluctuations and supernormal profit, the margin
earned by Infinite is 88.25% which is abnormally high. It was argued that such
companies which are making more than twice the arithmetical mean margin as
compared by the Ld. TPO should not be considered as comparable. The Ld. AR
referred to page 591 of the Paper Book where the details of the fluctuation in
the revenue, profit and margins has been provided. It is true that where
company in which extraordinary events had taken place during the year like
major acquisitions which had impact on profits of company, it could not be
selected as comparable to assessee engaged in software development. We place
reliance in this regard on the decision of Hyderabad Tribunal in the case of
Excellance Data Research (P) Ltd. vs. ACIT reported in [2016] 74 taxmann.com
13 (Hyd Trib) dated 12.09.2016 for Asst Year 2010-11, wherein it was held
that:
8\. Having regard to the rival contentions and the material on record, we find
that the DRP has directed the AO to consider whether the extra ordinary event
of amalgamation during the year is found to have an impact on the profits of
the company. We find that instead of carrying out the exercise, the AO has
simply followed the order of the TPO in holding that the fact of amalgamation
on the margin of the said company has no effect on the margin of the said
company. This, in our opinion, is not a correct approach of the AO. Where a
direction has been given by the DRP to follow a certain procedures, the AO has
simply followed the TPO order. Therefore, order of the AO on this issue needs
to be set aside. In the case of Hyundai Motors India Engg. (P) Ltd. (2015) 64
taxmann.com 442 (Hyd.- Trib), which is also engaged in rendering of ITES to
its AEs, the Tribunal has taken note of the same at para 9.1. and 9.3 of its
order. Therefore, the decision of the Tribunal in the said case is applicable
to the case on hand, more particularly since the comparables adopted by the
TPO in the said case are the same in the assessee's case also. In the case of
Hyundai Motors India Engg. (P) Ltd. (supra) at page 20, para 18, the Tribunal
has held as under:
> "18. As regards M/s Accentia Technologies Ltd., is concerned, we find that
> the DRP has directed to exclude this company by placing reliance upon the
> order of the ITAT in the assessee's own case for the A.Y. 2009-10 by holding
> that this company operates in a different business strategy of acquiring
> companies for  13 14 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute
> & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

17\. Following the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal we are of the view that
E- Infochips Bangalore Ltd., should be excluded from the list of comparable
companies while working out the arithmetic mean of the comparable companies.
18\. As far as Inteq Software Limited is concerned, the plea of the ld.
counsel for the assessee was that information regarding this company was not
available in the public domain and the TPO had obtained the financial results
by issuing of a notice u/s 133(6) of the Act. In the proceedings before DRP,
on request by the assessee the TPO shared some of the details that he received
from the aforesaid company. The details so obtained are at pages 613 to 617 of
the paper book Vol.II filed by the asessee. The information shared shows that
Inteq Software Limited is not purely software development service company and
provides besides software development, consultancy services, data warehousing,
EDI services besides Health Care BPO. The financial details of this company
which was shred by the TPO in the course of proceedings before DRP, is at
pages 269 to 297 of the assessee's paper book. Copy of profit and loss account
was not given to the assessee. However schedule forming part of the profit and
loss account has been furnished. The balance sheet has been furnished. The TPO
in his order has worked out operating profit to operating cost of this company
at 49.94%. On what basis this was worked out is not spelt out in the order of
DRP except for a reference to the information received in response to the
notice u/s 133(6) of the Act. It  15 16 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura
Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 is noticed from the information provided by the AO to the
assessee in the form of schedule forming part of the profit and loss account
that a sum of Rs.66,56,873/- being other income comprising of interest,
foreign exchange gain etc has been considered part of the operating profit. As
we have already seen that this company has different segments and no segmental
data has been provided by the TPO to the assessee. In these circumstances we
are of the view that it would be safe to exclude Inteq Software Pvt. Ltd from
the list of comparables. The process of computation of arms length price
involves comparability of profit margins of similar transactions by unrelated
parties and therefore correct and reliable data should be the basis on which
such comparability exercise should be carried out. When there is an element of
doubt on a particular data based on which comparability analysis is carried
out, it would be safe not to act on such data. We do not wish to go into the
question whether the TPO can rely on secret comparables. On the facts
available on record it transpires that no reliable data have been brought on
record to substantiate the margin of 49.91% determined by the TPO for this
company. In these circumstances we direct that Inteq Software Pvt. Limited be
excluded from the final list of comparable companies to be adopted by the TPO
for arriving at the average margin of comparable companies.
19\. As far as Gr.No.7 challenging the inclusion of M/S.Infinite Data Systems
Pvt.Ltd. (since merged) in the final set of comparables for the purpose of
determining the Arithmetic mean of comparable companies, the plea of the
Assessee is that this company is not functionally comparable with that of the
Assessee and also for the reason that this company has earned supernormal
operating margin. At the time of hearing the learned counsel for the Assessee
brought to our notice a decision of the ITAT Kolkata Tribunal in the case of
M/S.Labvantage Solution Pvt.Ltd., Vs. DCIT ITA No.617/Kol/2015 order dated
19.10.2016. The Assessee in that case was also a company engaged in the
business of rendering software development services. The Tribunal held that
Infinite Data Systems Pvt.Ltd., is not functionally comparable with a  16 17
ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 company rendering software development services. The following
were the relevant observations of the Tribunal.
> "Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) The Id AR argued that this company
> is functionally not comparable to the assessee and it is having a different
> business model. The company is engaged in providing entire gamut of
> solutions comprising of technical consulting, design and development of
> software, maintenance, system integration, implementation, testing and
> infrastructure management services. Further it is stated from the records
> that the revenue is primarily driven from technical support and
> infrastructure in management services. Further, as per the Annual Report of
> 2009, at Page 1, it is stated that the Holding Company M/s Infinite Computer
> Solutions (India) Limited signed an agreement (Build, Operate and Transfer
> Model) with Fujitsu Services Limited to set up Global Delivery Centers in
> India to provide offshore delivery capabilities to Fujitsu & Fujitsu's
> associated companies. Infinite Data Systems commenced its operations on 1 st
> January 2009 and as per segment reporting disclosure. the company's
> operations predominantly relate to providing software technical consultancy
> services to its sole customer Fujitsu Services Limited. The Id AR argued
> that these facts have also been acknowledged by the ld. TPO at page 77 .of.
> his order. Also, it would be worthwhile to note that Infinite Data Systems
> Pvt Ltd completed i three years contract with Fujitsu, post which, the
> business was transferred to Fujitsu and thus the company has been merged
> with its Holding Company - Infinite Computer Solutions (India) ltd during
> the financial year 2011-
> 12\. The Id AR argued that the assessee company is a service provider in
> area of software development whereas the comparable company Infinite Data
> Systems Pvt Ltd w created for purposes of transfer of business. The services
> and business model of assessee company and comparable company is entirely
> different. He also argued that there e abnormal circumstances in the said
> comparable. During the last 3 years, variation m margins earned shows an
> abnormal circumstances leading to huge fluctuation an supernormal profit,
> the margin earned by Infinite is 88.25% which is abnormally his . Such
> companies which are making more than twice the arithmetical mean margin
> computed by the Id TPO should not be considered as comparable. The ld AR
> referred t page 591 of the Paper Book where the details of the fluctuation
> in the revenue, profit an margins has been provided. Accordingly, he prayed
> for rejection of this comparable."
20\. The aforesaid reasoning of the Tribunal which decision was also rendered
in a case relating to AY 2010-11 will equally apply to the case of the
Assessee in this appeal  17 18 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research
Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 also as the functional profile of the Assessee and that of the
Assessee in the decision cited by the learned counsel for the Assessee are one
and the same. We therefore direct that M/S.Infinite Data Systems Pvt.Ltd., be
excluded from the list of comparable chosen by the TPO. Gr.No.7 raised by the
Assessee is accordingly allowed.
21\. As far as Gr.No.8 raised by the Assessee seeking exclusion of Thirdware
Solutions Ltd., and Com-U-Learn Tech India Ltd., in the final set of
comparables chosen by the TPO is concerned, the plea of the Assessee is that
these companies are not functionally comparable with that of the Assessee. It
is the plea of the Assessee that this company is in software consultancy,
application development services, application management support services,
enterprise application space. Our attention was drawn to this companies
website extract copies of which are at page 612 of Vol-II paper book filed by
the Assessee. Our attention was also drawn to the extract of this companies
financials at page 607 paper book-II wherein the fact that it is developing
software products from July, 2009 and that the products will be available for
sale to the customers during the financial year 2010-11 is clearly spelt out.
Our attention was also drawn to the fact that in the profit and loss account
there is reference to income from sale of licenses which is not the case
normally in the case of companies providing software development services.
Finally it was submitted that the segmental information of these companies is
not available as the primary segment is based on geographical area. Our
attention was also drawn to several cases decided by various benches of the
Tribunal on the comparability of this company with a software development
service provider such as the Assessee. We deem it appropriate to make mention
of onlyh one such decision rendered by the ITAT Ahmedabad Bench in the case of
I-Many Software Private Ltd. IT (TP) 222/Ahd/2015 order dated 27.10.2016 which
is in relation to AY 2010-11 and rendered in the context of a software
development service provider such as the Assessee.

22\. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the
Assessee as well as the learned DR who relied on the directions of the DRP. We
find that in the case of I-Many Software Pvt.Ltd., (supra) comparability of
this company with a software development services company such as the Assessee
was considered and it was held that this company is not a good comparable. The
following were the relevant observations of the Tribunal.
> "10. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the material on record.
> Solitary" grievance of the assessee through this ground is against the order
> of Id. ORP for approving the selection of comparable namely Thirdware
> Solution Ltd. by TPO. We observe that assessee is engaged in the business of

> software. Assessee also has not outsourced its business activities to third
> party and operates on the instructions of its associate enterprise. We
> further observe that assessee has referred and relied on various decisions
> of Co-ordinate Bench wherein it has been held that Thirdware Solution is not
> a good comparable for the purpose of T.P. adjustment with regard to the
> assessee engaged in the business of software development. We observe that
> Co-ordinate Bench Delhi in the case of ION Trading India Private Ltd. vs.
> ITO in ITA No.1 035/0el/2015 for Asst. Year 2010-11 has held as under :-
> "56. We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully

> that the functions of Thirdware are in account with the assessee which only
> provides software development in the finance domain as per the instruction

> Since it is also engaged in outsourcing its activities as it has incurred
> expenses towards imports of software services, evidencing outsourcing of
> software services unlike the appellant company. Hence, it is functionally

> 11\. We further observe that the Co-ordinate Bench, Oeli in the case of Sun
> Life India Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA NO.5799/0e1/2012 for AY
> 2008-09 has held as under :-
> "21. We hove perused the Annual report of this company which is available on
> pages 100 onwards of the paper book. The Profit & Loss Account of this

> We, therefore, order for the removal of this company from the list of
> comparables. "
> (emphasis supplied by us)
12\. Further the Co-ordinate Bench Delhi in the case of Avaya India (P) Ltd
vs. Addl.CIT (ITA No. 5528/0e1.l2011) has observed that Thirdware Solutions
has made income from sale of licence to the tune of more than RS.1 crore,
which means the company is into production of software products and therefore,
functionally different from contract software developer assessee. The relevant
extract of the decision is reproduced below"-
> "12. 1 ... (xxv) ... We have heard both the parties and perused the material
> available on record. A perusal of the annual report of Thirdware Solutions
> Ltd. reveals that the said company has made income from sale of licence to
> the tune of more than Rs. 1 crore, which means the company is into
> production of software products which apparently cannot be a comparable to
> assessee dealing with contract software development and not into sale of any
> product. Therefore, we direct TPO/AO to exclude this company from the list
> of comparables."
> (emphasis supplied by us)
13\. Respectfully following the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench referred
above in para 1 0,11 & 12, we find that the same are squarely applicable to
the facts of the assessee to the extent that assessee is also engaged in
software development valuation of production works of computer software and
operates mainly on the instructions of its associate enterprises whereas the
impugned comparable Thirdware Solution is additionally also in the business of
enterprises whereas the  20 21 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research
Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 impugned comparable Thirdware Solution is additonally also in the
business of trading of software outsources it activities. We are, therefore,
of the. view that Thirdware Solution is not a fit comparable in the case of
assessee for the purpose of making T.P. adjustment. We allow this ground of
assessee."
23\. Respectfully following the aforesaid decision, we direct exclusion of
Thirdware Solution as a comparable by the TPO for arriving at arithmetic mean
of comparable companies.
24\. As far as the company Comp U-Learn Tech India Ltd., is concerned, it was
the plea of the Assessee that this company is more into software products as
well as BPO services besides R & D activities in pharmaceutical sector and
that no segmental details of this company are available. It was brought to our
notice that the ITAT Hyderabad Bench in the case of Pegasystems Worldwide
India Pvt.Ltd. Vs. ACIT ITA No.1758/Hyd/2014 in relation to AY 2010-11 by
order dated 16.10.2015 held that this company is not comparable with a
software development services company such as the Assessee.
25\. We have considered the submission and we find that in the case of
Pegasystems Worldwide India Pvt.Ltd. (supra), a company engaged in rendering
software development services such as the Assessee, the Hyderabad Bench held
that this company is not comparable with a software development services
company. The following were the relevant observations:
> "9.2. After considering the rival contentions, we are of the opinion that on
> the basis of information available, Comp-U-Learn Tech India Ltd., cannot be
> selected as a functionally comparable company as it has diversified
> activities. Only if there are segmental reports pertaining to software
> development services, then only the company can be taken as comparable
> company. In the absence of such information, it is very difficult to hold
> that the selected company is comparable to Assessee-company. There is no
> information about the segmental profits. What that company has reported in
> its annual report is 'Income from software development' which cannot be
> equated as 'Income from services'. The software development may include sale
> of products. In the absence of segmental information, this case cannot be
> selected as comparable. However, whether TPO could obtain any segmental  21
> 22 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial
> Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11 information is not known to us. we are of the opinion that TPO
> should examine whether there are any segmental information which can be
> obtained from the company or available in the public domain so as to compare
> Assessee's software development services with that of software development
> services of Comp-U-Learn Tech India Ltd. Therefore, we :- 10 -: I.T.A. Nos.
> 1758 & 1936/Hyd/14 Pegasystems Worldwide India Pvt. Ltd., are of the opinion
> that the issue of selection of this company is a comparable should be
> restored to the file of AO/TPO to examine the available data in public
> domain/or obtaining information U/s. 133(6) of the Act for segmental
> information pertaining to software development services and then decide
> after giving due opportunity to Assessee whether the said company can be
> selected as comparable. For the time being, Assessee's objections are
> considered valid and issue is restored to the file of AO for undertaking
> analysis afresh as far as this company is concerned."
26\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal, we direct the TPO to
exclude this company from the list of comparables for the purpose of
determining ALP.
27\. As far as Gr.No.9 raised by the Assessee is concerned, the challenge to
including Kuliza Technologies Pvt.Ltd. as a comparable company was not
seriously contested and therefore the same is directed to be retained as a
comparable. The Assessee has however pointed out that the OP/OC of this
company has been wrongly calculated by the TPO by considering the Bad Debts of
this company as part of the non-operating profit of the Assessee. In this
regard, we have noticed that the TPO in his order at page- 8 paragraph 5.2 has
observed that certain items of income and expenses are non- operational income
or expenditure and will not be considered for calculating OP/OC profit margin.
One of the item of expenditure set out therein to be added to the income
(because it is non-operational) is provisions Other than provision for bad
debts. Therefore provision for bad debts was admitted by the TPO to be
considered for arriving at the operating profit of the Assessee. Apart from
the above, we find from the details of the provision for bad debts that the
Assessee developed software for its client and the quality was not upto the
mark owing to bugs in the software and therefore it was decided not to press
for payment by the customer and the sum receivable was written  22 23 ITA
Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies
Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 off. Thus it was very much part of the operating expense of the
company which will go to reduce the operating profit of the Assessee. Besides
the above, the ITAT Ahmedbad Bench in the case of I-Many Software Private Ltd.
(supra) for AY 2010-11, who is also a software development service provider
like the Assessee, has taken note of the view of the DRP in that case, wherein
the DRP held that bad debts written off should go to reduce the operating
income of that Assessee as it was more in the nature of regular business
expenditure. The tribunal accordingly directed the TPO to include bad debts as
expenditure while working operating income of the comparable company Kuliza
Technologies Pvt.Ltd. Respectfully following the said decision, we hold that
in computing the operating profit of Kuliza Technologies Pvt.Ltd., the AO
should reduce the bad debts written off from the operating income. We hold and
direct accordingly. Thus Gr.No.9 is partly allowed.
28\. As far as Gr.No.10 is concerned, the plea of the Assessee is that CG-VAK
Software Exports Ltd., is a good comparable company for the purpose of
determining ALP of the Assessee and was wrongly excluded by the TPO and DRP on
the ground that it was a consistently loss making company. In this regard, the
TPO has given the following reasons for not regarding this company as
comparable.
14.2. CG-VAK Software and Exports Limited The objection of the assessee in
respect of rejection of this entity is on account of the fact that this entity
and made profits in the period corresponding to F.Y. 2008-09 and
correspondingly it did not have persistent losses for the last three years;
including the year under consideration. In this regard, it is seen that the
analysis in respect of this comparable was made in the transfer pricing order
for the assessee for last year, in respect of the margins of this entity and
the same is reproduced below:
                               Revenue in Lakhs           Profit in Lakhs            Profit Margin

     24                                                          ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
                                                                                 A.Yr.2010-11
         Mar-11                        569.89                  -21.09                  -3.70%
         Mar-12                        639.79                 -114.73                 -17.93%
From perusal of the above analysis, it can be seen that the company has stated
making losses in the year ending March 2008, a trend which continues for
subsequent years and is being continued till date. This clearly imply that in
the period under consideration also the conditions were such that the entity
may be on the verge of closure, under -utilization of assets or human
resources which have been created/recruited earlier. Most of these exceptional
circumstances are not quantifiable so as to see the effect on their
profitability based on the date available in the public domain. As reasonable
adjustments cannot be made to account for these differences in exceptional
circumstances like gross under utilisation of assets/ resources and others,
the entity with such a profile is required to be excluded. Consequently, it
was not considered as comparable.
It can be seen that the difference is on account of loss calculated by the TPO
for FY 2008-09 at profit calculated by the assessee. In this regard, the
relevant segmental account, as available in the annual report is reproduced
below:
It is seen that the TPO has considered the data, as available in the segmental
accounts provided in the Annual report. The calculation of the assessee is as
follows:
24 25 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 It can be seen that the assessee has considered an amount of Rs.
50,64,576/- out of total amount of Rs. 57,48,817/- as allocable to this
segment, which has lead to the conversion of negative PLI to positive. The
details of this expenditure, as extracted from the Annual report is as given
below:
25 26 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015

29\. Before the DRP the principal contention of the Assessee was that the TPO
accepted this company as functionally comparable but excluded only for the
reason that it was consistently making losses. The Assessee had submitted
before the TPO that this company earned operating margin of 5.29% in AY
2009-10 from its software services segment. Hence the basis assumption of the
TPO that this company was consistently loss making company was incorrect.
Another submission was that when the Assessee conducted the TP study the
information available in the public domain was only financial information upto
to FY 2009-10 relevant to AY 2010-11. The TPO in the impugned order has taken
note of financial results for the subsequent years also, which was not
correct. The case of the Assessee was that, if the results of the software
development segment of this company, is considered and if foreign exchange
gain/loss is considered as part of the operating profit than this company's
profit margin for FY 2008-09 would be 5.29%. The DRP however upheld the order
of the TPO observing that this company was a consistent loss making company.
30\. Before the Tribunal the submission of the learned counsel for the
Assessee upon for reiterating submission made before DRP was that the DRP in
page-29 of its direction while working out the margins of another comparable
company Kuliza  26 27 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute
& Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 Technologies Pvt. Ltd., has accepted foreign exchange gain to be
part of the operating profits. It was submitted that foreign exchange gain
arising out of transactions of rendering software development services should
be considered as part of the operating profit and the law in this regard is
well settled. Reference was made to several judicial pronouncements in this
regard especially the decision of the Bangalore ITAT in the case of SAP Labs
(P) Ltd. Vs. ACIT 44 SOT 156 (Bang.) wherein it was held that foreign exchange
gain should be included while computing operating margin of comparables as
well as that of the Assessee for the purpose of comparison of margins while
determining ALP. The learned DR relied on the order of the TPO.
31\. We have considered the rival contentions. From a perusal of the order of
the TPO it is clear that the claim of the Assessee that this company's
operating profit to operating cost of the software development services
segment for AY 2009-10, if expenses are allocated on the basis of revenues, is
5.29%. This chart is extracted by the TPO in page-50 of his order ( and also
in paragraph 27 of this order) and even the TPO does not dispute this plea of
the Assessee. The TPO has however proceeded on the basis that foreign exchange
gain should not be regarded as part of the operating profit. Such approach of
the TPO has not been accepted by the DRP in its order while dealing with the
comparable company Kuliza Technologies Pvt.Ltd. Therefore it appears that the
plea of the Assessee that the basis assumption of the TPO and DRP on the
comparability of this company that it is a consistent loss making company is
erroneous and therefore their orders are set aside. However, the question
still remains as to whether the allocation of expenses and the attribution of
the foreign exchange gain to the software development services segment of the
comparable company CG-VAK software and Exports Ltd., has not been considered
by the TPO or DRP. Further it has also to be seen as to what were the reasons
for the losses in the case of this comparable company. If all these factors
are considered and due adjustment can be given to the operating margins of
this company, than the same should be considered as comparable  27 28 ITA
Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies
Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 company and added to the list of comparables for determining
Arithmetic mean of profits of comparable companies. The TPO is directed to
consider the comparability of this company afresh in the light of the
aforesaid observations and also taking note of decision rendered on this
aspect by Tribunals and Hon'ble High Courts if any.
32\. As far as Gr.No.11 raised by the Assessee is concerned, it projects the
grievance of the Assessee in rejecting Goldstone Technologies Ltd., as a
comparable company on the ground that it is functionally not comparable. On
the comparability of this company with a software development services company
such as the Assessee, we find that the TPO has rejected this company as a
comparable company for the reason that this company was not a pure software
development service provider as there were expenses relating to media and
therefore this company was considered as also in the business of media
services. The absence of segmental data was also given as a reason for not
regarding this company as a company in software development service sector.
The DRP also accepted the stand of the TPO.
33\. Before us the learned counsel for the Assessee drew our attention to
pages 754, 759, 763 and 764 of paper book Vol-II filed by the Assessee as also
pages 159 and 209 of paper book Vol.-I filed by the Assessee. Perusal of these
documents shows that the income as per the profit and loss account as on
31.3.2010 of this company was Rs.24,04,76,948 out of which income from
rendering software services was 23,18,69,452/-. Out of the income from
software services, income from export of software is Rs.20,75,99,979/-. Thus
this company satisfies the test of being a predominant software service
exporter such as the Assessee. The related party transaction of this company
is 10.71% which is well below the 15% mark. If related party transactions are
more than 15% than the company will be excluded from comparability for the
reason that the operating profits might be impacted by reason of related party
transactions. That is not the case with this company as the RPT is less than
28 29 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 15%. Therefore there appears to be no valid reason for not
regarding this company as a comparable company. The TPO is directed to regard
this company as comparable company in the final list of comparable companies
for the purpose of arriving at the arithmetic mean of profit margins of
comparable companies.
34\. As far as Grd.No.12 raised by the Assessee is concerned, the same is in
relation to the grievance of the Assessee in not considering R.S.Software
(India) Ltd., and Zylog Systems Ltd., as comparable companies by the TPO and
the DRP. The reason why these two companies were not regarded as comparable
companies by the TPO (upheld by DRP) was that the ratio of expenditure on
Advertising, Marketing and Sales promotion was more than 5% of the revenue.
The rationale for applying this filter is set out by the TPO in his order as
follows:
> "7. Companies with the ratio of advertising spend being more than 5% of the
> revenues were rejected.
> In the FAR analysis provided by you, it is submitted that the assessee did
> not market its services to the end customers as it only provide software
> development services to the associate enterprise. It is further stated that
> since it is a captive service provider and provides services only to the
> associate enterprise no market risk is being borne by it. Consequently, it
> is clear that the entities which are engaged in such additional function
> would be in comparable to you. Therefore, the TPO has rejected those
> entities whose advertising spend was more than 5% of the revenues. In order
> to determine the advertising spend the expenditure incurred and shown in
> Prowess database under advertising, marketing and distribution expenses were
> consolidated and the same was utilised. It must be mentioned that this
> filter was applied by you lost year but the some has not been applied in
> this year."
35\. The DRP upheld the stand of the TPO. The submission of the Assessee
before the DRP and the DRP's decision on such submission was as follows:
> "d) Rejecting companies with the ratio of sum of advertising, marketing &
> distribution expenses to sales more than 5% The Assessee wishes to submit
> that the filter applied by the ld. TPO is not appropriate due to following
> reasons :
29 30 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 For difference in activities including advertising/marketing, the
assessee has requested for necessary market risk adjustments (please refer to
Ground No.10 below) The TPO has not argued that comparable companies are
functionally different. Hence, rejecting the comparable companies by putting
additional filter is not justified. Additional filter reduces the number of
comparables available which are otherwise functionally comparable.
The OECD Guidelines 2010 which acknowledges the need for broadening the search
criteria to accommodate for the limitations in available comparables. The
relevant extract from the OECD Guldel.ncs 2010 is as follows:
> "3.38. The identification of potential comparables has to be made with the
> objective of finding the most reliable data, recognising that they will not
> always be perfect. For instance, independent transactions may be scarce in
> certain markets and industries. A pragmatic solution may need to be found,
> on a case-by-case basis, such as broadening the search and using information
> on uncontrolled transactions taking place in the same industry and e
> comparable geographical market, but. performed by third parties that may
> have different business strategies, business: models or other slightly
> different economic circumstances; information on uncontrolled transactions
> taking place in the same industry but in other geographical markets; or
> information on uncontrolled transactions taking place in the same
> geographical market but in other industries, "
• The above recommendation under the OECD Guidelines 2010 is also supported by
the Advance Pricing Agreement Program Traoining Manual of USA which recognizes
the need to relax the comparability criteria in order- to arrive at a wider
set of companies:
• In the case of Actis Advisers Pvt Ltd (ITA No. 5277 /Del/2011) it was held
that comparables, which are otherwise similar, shall not be rejected merely on
the ground that comparables who had incurred high marketing and advertising
expenditure are functionally different.
Given the above, we submit that Ld. TPO has wrongly rejected our our
comparables RS Software (India) Ltd and Zylog Systems Ltd by applying this
filter.
Further, we submit that the clear breakup of marketing and selling expenses is
not provided for these comparables in their annual reports. The Ld. TPO has
considered the proportion of 5% on sales. It is pertinent to note that selling
30 31 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial
Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 expenses does not always mean advertising and marketing expenses,
hence in the absence of required details, the filter cannot be applied in
generality.
Decision :
5.2. Software industry is manpower intensive and significant part of their
expenses relate to salaries and bonus. On an average, salary cost comprises
24% to 42% of the revenue in the case of software service providers. As p.er
the data in Prowess database, the average employee cost works out to about
39'% on sales. This being so, low expenditure on salary/ ernplovee rco st is
an indication that the company is either into further outsourcing of work or
is in product development / trading. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the
fiiter of 25% of sales as minimum salary expenses used by the TPO is fair and
appropriate. PerSistently loss making companies or companies with declining
revenue may have some exceptional circumstances and unique factors
contributing to such results that make them not suitable for comparability
analysis. Moreover", the financial results of comparable companies should be
of the same period as that of the assessee i.e. April to March, as that only
enable proper comparison between them. In respect of rejection of companies
having ratio of advertising, marketing and distribution expenses to sales more
than 5%. Normally a company having high ratio of these expenses would be
engaged in selling of products on a substantial scale. Obviously such a
company would not be functionlly similar to a software services providing
company like the Assessee. Therefore, the TPO was justified in applying this
filter as well. The TPO was also justified in applying filter for rejecting
companies where export earning was 75% of the sales as this criteria has been
applied by the TPO resulting sufficient number of comparables therefore there
was no reason for further relaxation. Therefore, the objection raised by the
assessee in respect of these filters cannot be upheld. In view of the above
discussion, the objections raised by the assessee against the rejection of its
TP study by the TPO and use of new quantitative and qualitative filters used
by the TPO do not stand the analysis of merits and therefore, rejected. Action
of the TPO is upheld."
36\. The learned counsel for the Assessee did not dispute the proposition that
the filter of rejecting companies with the ratio of advertising spend being
more than 5% of the revenues by the TPO and DRP. His limited submission was
the Assessee will not satisfy the test of its AMP being more than 5% of the
revenues, if correct AMP expenses are taken. In this regard the learned
counsel for the Assessee brought to our notice that the Special Bench of ITAT
Delhi in the case of LG electronics India Pvt.Ltd., ITA No.5140/Del/2011 has
taken the view that sales expenses are not part of  31 32 ITA
Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies
Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 the Advertising, Marketing and sales promotion. Our attention was
drawn to the following observations of the special Bench:
> "18.3. Having heard the rival submissions on this issue, we find that the
> AMP expenses refer only to advertisement, marketing and publicity expenses.
> A divider needs to be placed between the expenses for the promotion of sales
> on one hand and expenses in connection with the sales on the other. Both

37\. It was submitted that if sales expenses are excluded than the percentage
of AMP expenses to revenue will be below 5% and there would be no reason to
exclude this company as comparable company. It was submitted that the fact
that this company is otherwise comparable functionally is not disputed by the
TPO. It was prayed that the issue may be set aside for the purpose of
ascertaining the quantum of AMP to revenue after excluding sales expenses and
if the comparable companies pass the test, then they should be included in the
list of comparable companies. The learned DR relied on the order of the
TPO/DRP.
38\. We have given a careful consideration to the rival submissions and are of
the view that the prayer made by the learned counsel for the Assessee for a
remand to the TPO/AO for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of AMP to
revenue after excluding sales expenses and if the comparable companies pass
the test, then they should be included in the list of comparable companies, is
acceptable. As rightly contended by him sales expenses should be excluded
while arriving at the AMP expenses and only thereafter the same should be
compared with the revenues before applying the filter of 5% AMP expenses to
sales. We direct the TPO to ascertain this aspect after affording Assessee
opportunity of being heard and decide the issue as per the directions given
above.
39\. As far as Gr.No.13 is concerned, the grievance of the Assessee is that
Helios and Matheson Information Technology Ltd., ought not to have been
excluded from the list of comparable companies by the TPO and DRP. The TPO and
DRP rejected this company as not comparable because it had different financial
year ending for preparation of their financial statements and the period of
profit margins earned by these  33 34 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura
Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11 two companies therefore cannot be compared with the Assessee's
profit margin which would be for a different period. The argument of the
revenue is that change of financial year will have effect because of the
business cycle and market and other economic conditions. The argument of the
Assessee is that if those factors are same for the period for which profit
margins are compared than there should be no objection because otherwise these
two companies are functionally comparable. We are of the view that the middle
path to be adopted would be to cull out the results of the comparable
companies for the financial year of the Assessee, if it is possible and then
make a comparison of the profit margins. If such authentic data for culling
out the profit margins are not available, then it would be safe to exclude
this company from the list of comparable companies. With these observations
the comparability of this company is set aside to the TPO/AO for adjudication
afresh after affording opportunity of being heard to the Assessee.
40\. As far as Gr.No.14 raised by the Assessee is concerned, the same projects
the grievance of the Assessee in the action of the TPO and DRP in rejecting
Mindtree Ltd., and Quintegra Solutions Ltd., from the list of comparable
companies on the ground that there were exceptional circumstances that
prevailed in the affairs of these two companies during the relevant financial
year the results of which were taken up for comparison. It is undisputed that
Mintree Ltd., amalgamated with Aztec Software Ltd., during the previous year
and due to this factor accurate adjustment cannot be given to the operating
margins by eliminating factors which would contribute to low or high profit
margins. In the case of Quintegra Solutions Ltd., this company acquired some
other companies and the real operating margins of these two companies could
not be arrived at after giving appropriate adjustments. In such circumstances,
we are of the view that it would be safe to exclude these two companies from
the list of comparable companies. We therefore confirm the order of the DRP on
this issue.

41\. As far as Gr.No.15 and 16 are concerned, they project the grievance of
the Assessee in the action of the TPO and DRP in not allowing adjustments to
the arithmetic mean of profits of the final comparable companies towards
working capital and other risks which according to the Assessee are required
to be given under the provisions of Rule 10B(1)( e) of the Income Tax Rules,
1962 (Rules).
42\. The DRP dealt with this issue as follows:
> Decision:

> allowing working 'capital adjustment to the margins of the comparables as
> well as in its own case the- claim of working capital adjustment is not

43\. Before us the learned counsel for the Assesee has filed a decision of the
ITAT Bangalore in the case of Unisys India (P) Ltd. Vs. DCIT (2015) 60

Assistant Commissioner of Income tax (2013)27ITR (Trib) 74 Mum., held as

44\. Respectfully following the aforesaid ruling, we direct the TPO to make
adjustments on account of working capital to the profit margin of the Assessee
as well as the comparables and allow adjustments in accordance with law, after
affording opportunity of being heard to the Assessee. We may also add that the
DRP in Assessee's own case for AY 2012-13 in its order dated 22.9.2016 allowed
claim of the Assessee for adjustment on account of working capital. A copy of
the said order is also placed on record.

45\. As far as the plea of the Assessee made in ground No.16 for allowing
adjustment towards other risk is concerned, the claim of the Assessee in this
regard was rejected by the TPO for the following reasons:
> "18.10 The summary of risk analysis for the assessee can be made as follows:
> • The assessee is totally dependent on the AE for business. Thus the
> assessee takes the risks associated with heavy dependence on a single
> customer. In common business parlance it is known as 'single customer risk'.
> • The assessee is not compensated any amount for termination of agreement
> even if it is terminated without any cause. No independent enterprise would
> like to agree for a termination clause without compensation if it is
> terminated without any cause.
> • The AE is exposed to the market risk and any fluctuation in the business
> conditions of the AE affect the contractual terms between the AE and the
> assessee. Thus even if independent comparables undertake some risk, the
> assessee also had to undertake risks like single customer risk, political
> risk, etc which are not incurred by the comparable companies and hence the
> risks are evened out.
> • The independent entrepreneur has to incur expenditure on marketing, etc.
> which is debited to the profit and loss account. But, it is always not
> necessary that these risks reflected in the marketing, sales promotion
> expenses will automatically be compensated by Increase in sales or higher
> margins. For example, increased marketing efforts in some segments of export

> there may be a loss on this marketing effort which may bring down the
> overall profitability rather than increase the profitability. Thus if
> undertaking the market risk etc. helps in earning any extra margin, the
> benefit is more than set off by the corresponding expenditure. The same

A.Yr.2010-11 • The risk profile of the comparables selected by the assessee,
acceptable to the assessee and those selected by the TPO but not acceptable to
the assessee is similar.
• It is incorrect to say that higher the risk, the higher is the margin though
it is true that higher risk expects a higher margin. Thus realization of risk
is different from expected return based on risk undertaken.
• The assessee's single customer risk and political / country risk more than
offsets any other risk differential between the assessee and the comparable
companies.
• Different comparables can have different risk profiles and different profit
margins. The proviso to Sec. 92C(2) of the Act provides for adopting
arithmetical mean of the different prices This provision neutralizes the
effect of difference in the risk profile, if any between the assessee and the
comparables as realized risk may pull down the profitability below the risk
free return.
• It is not sufficient to merely spell out risks. But, it has to be shown
which risk was actually undertaken by the comparables and to what extent it
affected the profitability. The. assessee has not done so.
18.11 In view of the above discussion there is no merit in the claim of
assessee for risk adjustment and the same is rejected. It may not be out of
place to mention here that it has been held, in different judicial decision
that the risk adjustment can't be granted as a rule. Some of such judgments
are:
i. As the 'A' failed to bring any evidence of record to show that there was
any difference in risk profiles of comparable companies and since the 'A'
failed to file the details exhibiting risk borne by comparables, no risk
adjustment can be given, even on ad hoc basis.- Marubeni India Pvt ltd
(2011-TII-36-ITAT-Del-TP) ii. Unless it is shown that difference in function
and risk leads to inflation or deflation of financial results, risk
adjustments need not be granted as a rule. Assessee could not show how such
risk difference affected the results of the comparables. Assessee could not
quantify these differences for each comparable.- Symantec Software Solutions
Pvt Ltd(2011-TII-60-ITAT-Mum-TP) iii. There are several factors such as market
risks, which affect the results of the company. These factors make it
impracticable to find out exact duplicate of the assessee as comparable. Some
variation is bound to exist. The TPO had identified comparables whose
functions were similar to the assessee by applying quantitative and
qualitative filters to eliminate differences between the assessee and the  38
39 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015 M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial

A.Yr.2010-11 comparable to neutralize the risk factors. The assessee's
argument that it is a "Iow end performer" operating in "risk-free environment"
and that suitable adjustment should be made is not acceptable;- DCIT vs.
Deloitte Consulting India Pvt. limited (ITAT Hyderabad) 18.12 Taking all these
facts entirely into account, the assessee is not entitled for any risk
adjustment."
46\. On objection of the Assessee on the above conclusion of the TPO in his
order, the DRP upheld the action of the TPO, for the following reasons:
> "Decision:
> 11.2. The claim of the Assessee for risk adjustment has been considered.
> While as per the Rules, adjustment should be provided for each function and
> difference of the risk identified. Needless to say as mentioned in OECD TP
> Guidelines, the exercise requires judgment and it is practically not
> possible to quantify the difference in exact numeric terms and would have to
> be based on most reliable methods/estimates. What is to be appreciated is
> whether an independent enterprise would agree for such adjustment to the
> price in the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. It has
> been held in Symantech software solutions Pvt. Ltd. 2011-TII-16-Mum-TP
> unless it has shown the difference in function leads to inflation and
> deflation of financial results, risk adjustment need not be granted as a
> rule. The A.O. has conducted the detailed analysis of the assessee in para
> 18.10 of his order therefore considering the same and the above it is held
> that the assessee is not entitled to any risk assessment nor has the
> Assessee given details or quantification of the risk Assessment its
> objections cannot be accepted and the action of the A.O. is upheld."
47\. The learned counsel for the Assessee has placed on reliance on several
decisions rendered on the issue of risk adjustment to be given and the same
are in CLPB vol-I.
48\. We have considered the submissions and the decisions in this regard cited
before us in which it has been held that appropriate adjustments have to be
given for various risks, such as the one claimed by the Assessee in the
present case. The following are the decisions in support of such proposition:

> M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
> A.Yr.2010-11
> 1\. Hyundai Motors India Engineering Pvt. Ltd. vs. The ITO, Ward-2(2),

> 2\. M/s 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd. Vs. DCIT, Circle-11(1), Bangalore

> 5\. M/s Sony India (P) Limited, Appellant vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income
> Tax, Respondent, and Vice Versa
> 6\. Philips Software Center Private Limited vs. ACIT (119 TTJ 721)
49\. It cannot be said as a rule that no risk adjustment can be given. It can
also not be said that the risk adjustment should be given in all cases. It
depends on facts and circumstances of each case. As far as the present case is
concerned the Assessee is a captive service provider and dependent on its
associate enterprises and therefore there is a single customer risk. Besides
the above the assessee has also highlighted several other risk factors. In the
decisions cited by the ld. Counsel for the assessee, Tribunal has taken the
view adjustment towards the risk factors should be given. We are of the view
that it would be just and appropriate to set aside the order of the DRP on
this issue and remand the question of allowing risk adjustment to the AO for
fresh consideration. This ground no.16 is thus treated as allowed for
statistical purposes.
50\. As far as grounds of appeal raised by the revenue are concerned while
dealing with the grounds of appeal of the assessee we have already held that
foreign exchange loss or gain will be considered as part of the operating
profits of the assessee. If they relate to and arise out of the business of
the assessee and in particular the transactions in relation to which the arms
length price is determined. In the present case the assessee is a captive
service provider and software development is the only activity of the assessee
and therefore income arising out of foreign exchange gain or loss has to be
regarded as part of the operating income of the assessee.
40 41 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
51\. As far as ground no.2 raised by the revenue is concerned in the present
case as we have already seen that though the nomenclature used by the assessee
was bad debts the reality is that the amount written off as bad debts is like
sales return, where customers have not paid for software development because
they did not find software due to existence of bugs. It has a direct nexus
with the business and transaction for which the arms length price is to be
determined, therefore the same has to be considered as part of operating
expense for the purpose of determining the profit margin. We therefore do not
find any merits in the grounds raised by the revenue.
52\. Ground No.17 raised by the assessee reads as follows :-
> " 17. For that the Authorities below erred in disallowing a sum of
> Rs.2,99,979/- under section 14A of the Act read with Rule 8D(2)(iii) of the
> Rules. "
53\. As far as ground no. 17 raised by the assessee is concerned, the issue is
with regard to disallowance of expenses incurred earning exempt income. The
disallowance was made by the AO by invoking the provision of section 14A of
the Act. The claim of the assessee was that the assessee received as dividend
of only a sum of Rs.33,79,674/- which was not chargeable to tax under the Act
and exempt. The assessee computed the disallowance of expenses incurred for
earning tax free income in terms of Sec.14A of the Act of a sum of
Rs.1,12,895/- being 10% of salary and allowances to the finance and
administrative staff. According to the assessee this was only expenditure
which can be attributable for earning tax free income. The AO however invoked
the provision of Rule 8D(2)(iii) of the Rules and made disallowance of
Rs.4,12,874/- but restricted the disallowance of Rs.2,99,979/- (4,12,874 -
1,12,895) since the assessee has already disallowed Rs.1,12,895/-.
54\. On objection by the assessee before DRP the DRP confirmed the action of
the AO.
41 42 ITA Nos.587&590/Kol/2015
M/s. Nomura Research Institute & Financial Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
A.Yr.2010-11
55\. We have heard the rival submissions. The computation of disallowance u/s
14A of the Act was done by the assessee by attributing 10% of the salary and
allowances of the finance and administrative staff. This disallowance was made
having regard to the books of accounts of the assessee. This disallowance made
by the assessee has taken care of the activities of the assessee and the
probable time that needs to be spent for managing the investments which are
likely to be tax free income. Neither the AO nor the DRP have found fault with
this calculation made by the assessee. The provision of Rule 8D(1) as also the
provision of section 14A(2) of the Act mandate disallowance in accordance with
Rule 8D(2) of the Rules, only where having regard to the accounts of the
assessee, the AO is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the
assessee regarding expenditure incurred to earn tax free income. In the
absence of any reason in given for rejecting the claim of the assessee, we
hold that disallowance u/s 14A of the Act should be restricted only to the sum
of Rs.1,12,895/- as disallowed by the assessee in its computation. Thus ground
no. 17 raised by the assessee is allowed.
56\. Ground No.18 raised by the assessee reads as follows :-
> " 18. For that the Assessing Officer erred in adding back depreciation of
> Rs.42,58,767 as per the Appellant's books of account and in granting
> deduction of depreciation as per Rules of Rs.34,05,607/-."
57\. As far as ground no.18 raised by the assessee is concerned, while
computing the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act, the AO is not empowered to
make any adjustment which is not permitted by the explanation below section
115JB of the Act. The depreciation to be allowed while working the book
profits is always as per the Companies Act and the depreciation should not be
reduced as is done in the normal assessments by substituting the depreciation
claimed under the Companies Act by the depreciation allowable under the Act.
The action of the AO is per se unsustainable and the AO is directed to deduct
depreciation only as per the Companies Act as done by the Assessee in its
computation of book profits for the purpose of Sec.115JB of the Act.

58\. Ground No.19 raised by the assessee reads as follows :-
> " 19. For that the Assessing Officer erred in adding back Rs.2,99,979 under
> section 14A of the Act read with rule 8D(2)(iii) of the Rules while
> computing book profits."
59\. As far as ground No.19 is concerned while deciding ground no.17 raised by
the assessee we have also held that the computation of disallowance u/s 14A of
the Act as made by the assessee has to be accepted. Therefore ground no.19
does not require any separate consideration.
60\. In the result the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed and the appeal
by the revenue is dismissed.
