denigrating the Plaintiff's KWALITY WALL'S products (including Frozen Desserts
manufactured and/ or sold under the said brand and sub-brands thereof) or the
Plaintiff's business in any manner whatsoever.
2] The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present Appeal are as under:-
3] The Plaintiff - Hindustan Unilever Limited, is a Public Limited Company
incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. Prior to 1956, the name of the
Plaintiff was Lever Brothers (India) Limited which was changed to Hindustan
Lever Limited with effect from 3 rd October, 2007 and subsequently to
Hindustan Unilever Limited on  3/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 :::
Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc 11th June, 2007. The
Plaintiff carries on business of manufacturing and selling Fast Moving
Consumer Goods ('FMCG'), including frozen desserts and ice cream under the
mark "KWALITY WALL'S". 4] Defendant No.1 - Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing
Federation Limited is a co-operative body of milk producers in Gujarat and is
engaged in marketing of various dairy and dairy based products including ice
creams under the mark "AMUL" and is a competitor of the Plaintiff. Defendant
No.2 - FCB Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd is an advertising agency.
5] Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 - Vadilal Industries Ltd and Vadilal Dairy
International Limited are manufacturers of frozen dessert products i.e. the
same class of products as that of the Plaintiff. The said Defendants have been
impleaded as Defendants by the Plaintiff since, according to the Plaintiff,
they have common interest as of the Plaintiff.
6] It was the case of the Plaintiff that they are one of the India's  4/46 :::
Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP)
340-17.doc most well-known and reputed Company in the business of FMCG having
their presence in foods and beverages sectors and household & personal care
products. The Plaintiff's products are spread across several distinct consumer
categories. The case of the Plaintiff is that their sales are over several
crores. It is the case of the Plaintiff that their products are of excellent
quality, enjoy a very high reputation and are sold in over one million retail
outlets. It is further the case of the Plaintiff that "KWALITY" has been a
well recognized brand in India, having been in the market for over 70 years.
The said brand was acquired by the Plaintiff before entering into the business
of ice creams and desserts in India. The said brand KWALITY has been used
alongwith Plaintiff's own global brand WALL'S as KWALITY WALL'S. It is the
case of the Plaintiff that, since it was the first ever ice cream brand
introduced in the Indian market, "KWALITY" enjoys a special status in the eyes
of public being a very popular trade mark. The Plaintiff has been
manufacturing and selling the KWALITY WALL'S products in India since 1998.
According to the Plaintiff, majority of the KWALITY WALL'S products sold in
India are classified as frozen desserts under the Food and Safety Standards
Act, 2006 ('FSSA') and  5/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc the Regulations framed thereunder. It
is the case of the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff is the market leader amongst
the organized players in the frozen deserts category with 51.3% market share.
It is the case of the Plaintiff that its products, including its frozen
desserts, scrupulously meet, satisfy and comply with all the requirements of
law, rules, regulations and other requirements. According to the Plaintiff,
frozen desserts are safe, healthy, hygienic and fit for human consumption. 7]
It is the case of the Plaintiffs that the two impugned Television Commercials
(For short 'TVCs') advertised by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 had an effect of
disparaging the frozen desserts, majority of which are manufactured and
marketed by the Plaintiff, having 51.3% of the market share. It is the case of
the Plaintiff that in the said TVCs, it is shown that the product of the
Defendant No.1 is manufactured by using 100% milk whereas frozen desserts are
manufactured by using Vanaspati. It is the case of the Plaintiff that
Vanaspati is hydrogenated vegetable oil, which is considered to be unhealthy
in the Indian society. It is the case of the Plaintiff that Vanaspati is
considered to be having bad effects on the health of the consumers. It  6/46
::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP)
340-17.doc is the case of the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff is not using
Vanaspati in its product but is using edible vegetable oil. It is the case of
the Plaintiff that, both, ice creams as well as frozen desserts contain 90% of
milk. Insofar as ice creams are concerned, ice creams contain a small amount
of dairy fat whereas insofar as frozen desserts are concerned, frozen desserts
contain a small amount of edible vegetable oil, which, according to the
Plaintiff, is more healthy than dairy fat. However, the impugned TVCs depict
that frozen desserts contain 100% vanaspati oil and as such, the said TVCs are
not permissible in law.
8] In this background, the Plaintiff has filed the suit to restrain Defendant
Nos. 1 and 2 from inter alia (i) telecasting or broadcasting or otherwise
howsoever communicating to the public or publishing two Television Commercials
or any part thereof, or any other advertisement of a similar nature in any
language, or in any manner causing the Impugned TVCs or any part thereof or
any other advertisement of a similar nature to be telecast or broadcast or
communicated to the public or published in any manner and (ii)  7/46 :::

340-17.doc disparaging or denigrating the Plaintiff's KWALITY WALL'S products
(including frozen desserts manufactured and / or sold under the said brand and
sub-brands thereof), or the Plaintiff's business in any manner whatsoever.
9] It further appears that in the said Suit, Plaintiff has also filed Notice
of Motion seeking interim injunction of similar nature against the Defendants.
The said Notice of Motion was resisted by the Defendants. The defence of the
Defendants was that, the advertisements did not show product of the Plaintiff.
However, what was shown was the comparison between the product of the
Defendants and the frozen desserts. It was also the contention of the
Defendants that atleast 30% of the manufacturers of the frozen desserts use
Vanaspati i.e. hydrogenated vegetable oil and as such, what was sought to be
shown by them was a factual position. The Motion was therefore vehemently
opposed by the Defendants. 10] The learned Single Judge, after hearing the
parties at length, has granted an order of injunction as aforesaid. Being
aggrieved thereby, the present appeal.

(APP) 340-17.doc 11] We have heard Mr. Kadam, learned Senior Counsel appearing
on behalf of the Appellant/Defendant No.1 and Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior
Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent No.1/Plaintiff.
12] Mr. Kadam, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that insofar as the first TVC
is concerned, the word used by the Defendants was 'Vanaspati'. It is submitted
that, since the Plaintiff had an objection to the use of the word 'Vanaspati',
the same was omitted in the subsequent advertisement and was replaced with the
word "Vanaspati tel". Mr. Kadam further contended that, as a matter of fact,
"Vanaspati tel" means edible vegetable oil, which is admittedly used by the
Plaintiff in its product. It is submitted that a perusal of the complaint
which was made by one of the Senior Officers of the Plaintiff to the
Advertisement Standard Council of India ("ASCI"), would show that what was
found to be objectionable was the word 'Vanaspati'. He therefore submitted
that, once the Defendants omitted the word "Vanaspati" and substituted the
same with the word  9/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc "Vanaspati tel", which, in fact, is
used by the Plaintiff in its product, the grievance could not survive.
13] Mr. Kadam, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, further submitted
that, the learned Single Judge ought not to have granted relief in favour of
the Respondent No.1/Plaintiff inasmuch as the Plaintiff has indulged into
suppression of material facts and on the very ground of conduct of the
Plaintiff, the learned Single Judge ought to have rejected the Motion. He
submitted that the correspondence between the Plaintiff and ASCI has not been
placed on record in the suit by the Plaintiff.
14] Mr. Kadam further submitted that, to find out as to whether a particular
TVC disparages the product of the rival or not, Court has to apply the test of
an ordinary person with reasonable intelligence. He submitted that, what is
required to be seen is that, in the short period during which the
advertisement is aired, what is registered in the mind of an ordinary person
with reasonable intelligence. He submitted that it is not permissible to
analyse the  10/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018
06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc advertisement in great detail to find out as to
whether the same would amount to disparagement or not. He, however, submitted
that the judgment of the learned Single Judge would reveal that, he has
discerned the advertisement in great detail and after doing that exercise, has
found the advertisement to be disparaging. He therefore submitted that the
procedure as adopted by the learned Single Judge, was not permissible in law.
15] Mr. Kadam further submitted that the Appellant had not at all referred to
the product of the Plaintiff but what was shown was comparison between ice
cream and frozen dessert. He therefore submitted that the Plaintiff had no
cause of action to file the suit on the ground of generic disparagement.
16] Mr. Kadam has relied on following judgments in support of the proposition
that the comparison between the two products is permissible.

further submitted that if, in comparison, true facts are brought to the notice

amount to educating the consumers. He further submitted that, while
considering the advertisement, rival is not expected to be hypersensitive to
the advertisement. He submitted that, if the TVC as a whole is considered, the
impression which the ordinary person with reasonable intelligence may get is
that the Appellant uses milk for manufacturing its product whereas, in the
frozen desserts, manufacturers also use edible oil, which is a matter of 2

Senior Counsel therefore submitted that, the learned Single Judge has grossly
erred in granting injunction. 17] Mr. Kadam, in the alternative, submitted
that the injunction granted by the learned Single Judge is in the widest
possible terms, which, in no case, could have been granted. He submitted that
the learned Single Judge has injuncted the Appellant from even airing similar
advertisement without defining the scope thereof. He submitted that on account
of injunction granted by the learned Single Judge, the Appellant stands at a
risk, to face contempt proceedings, inasmuch as its competitors may challenge
any advertisement aired by the Appellant on the ground that, it is similar to
the one which is the subject matter of the present proceedings. He submitted
that, in any case, injunction granted under clause (ii) of the operative part
of the impugned order is not sustainable in law, since it has been granted in
the widest possible terms, without there being any material to show that the
Appellant was even attempting generally to disparage products of the
Plaintiff. He submitted that, at the most, the learned Single Judge could have
granted injunction,  13/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc restraining the Appellant from airing
the TVCs which were impugned in the suit. He submitted that however the
learned Single Judge has gone far ahead and granted injunction in the widest
possible terms. 18] Mr. Chinoy, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
the Respondent/Plaintiff, submitted that the learned Single Judge has
considered all aspects of the matter. He also submitted that what is required
to be seen by the Court is, what impression an ordinary person with reasonable
intelligence would get, after seeing the advertisement. He submitted that if
TVCs are seen in its entirety, the impression that the ordinary person with
reasonable intelligence would get is that, the product of the Appellant is
manufactured by using only milk whereas, the frozen dessert, in which market,
the Respondent No.1/Plaintiff, holds majority shares, is manufactured by using
Vanaspati. He submitted that, the message that the advertisement intends to
give to the consumers at large, is apparent from the advertisement. He
submitted that in one Cup, the stream of milk is shown to be flowing, whereas,
in other Cup with label "frozen dessert" Vanaspati i.e. semi solid product is
dropping. He submitted, that since in India, Vanaspati is considered to be
dangerous to the  14/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc health, the message is loud and
clear, that frozen desserts are not good for health. He submitted that,
insofar as puffing up of the product of the Appellant is concerned, nobody
could have objection, even if an untrue statement is made. However, the
advertisement carrying the message which disparages the product of the
competitors, would not be permissible in law.
19] Mr. Chinoy also submitted that, as a matter of fact, in the earlier
advertisements, the words used by the Appellant were that the frozen desserts
are made from cheaper vegetable oil/fats. However, now subsequently, the
Appellant has improvised itself and started using the word "Vanaspati", which
is considered to be harmful for health. In reply to the contention raised by
Mr. Kadam with regard to the meaning of the word "Vanaspati" and the words
"edible vegetable oil", being having the same meaning in FSSA Regulations is
concerned, Mr. Chinoy submitted, that the consumers are not expected to sit
with dictionary to find out, what is the meaning of the word or, for that
matter, to go into definition of a particular product under the Regulations
framed under FSSA. He submitted that, what  15/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018
::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc is required to be
seen is, as to what is the meaning of that word,in common parlance. He
submitted that, in common parlance, the word "Vanaspati" is identified with
hydrogenated vegetable oil. He therefore submitted, that word "Vanaspati" is
identified to be an unhealthy product and therefore such advertisement which
shows, that the product of the Plaintiff is made only out of "Vanaspati"
amounts to nothing else but disparagement. Mr. Chinoy further submitted that,
not only that, in the affidavit in reply filed to the Notice of Motion, the
Appellant itself has admitted that Vanaspati is not good for health. It is
therefore submitted that, knowing very well that Vanaspati is not considered
to be good for health, the Appellant has used the said word in the
advertisement, only with an intention to disparage the product frozen
desserts.
20] The present appeal is an appeal against the grant of injunction in favour
of the Plaintiff. The scope of interfering in appeal which is filed
challenging the grant or refusal to grant injunction, has been laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Wander Ltd and another vs. Antox

21] The learned Single Judge has, in detail, considered both the
advertisements. We find that it will be appropriate to refer to the following

22] We have also seen the said TVCs. The first impression upon seeing the
overall advertisement, that one would get is that the product of the Appellant
viz ice cream is manufactured by using 100% milk, whereas frozen desserts are
manufactured by using 100% Vanaspati or Vanaspati tel. The advertisement shows
that a stream of white milk is flowing in the Cup of the product of the
Appellant whereas in the Cup labled as "Frozen Dessert", chunk's of
hydrogenated vegetable oil which is murky in colour, is flowing. It is thus
clear that the first over all impression that the viewers of the advertisement
may get is that the frozen desserts are manufactured by using 100%
hydrogenated vegetable oil, which is unhealthy for consumers thereof.

(APP) 340-17.doc 23] We will refer to some of the judgments which have
considered the issue.
24] One of us (B.R. Gavai, J.), while sitting as a Single Judge, had an
occasion to consider an identical issue in the case of Godrej Consumer
Products Limited vs. Initiative Media Advertising & Anr 11\. In the said
judgment, the Single Judge of this Court, while considering various earlier
judgment on the issue, has observed thus :
> 10\. In the case of Dabur India Limited v. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd.

11\. The Delhi High Court again in Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan
Lever Limited (supra) had an occasion to consider the advertisement of
defendant therein telecast on television for promotion of its soap "LIFEBOY".
According to the plaintiff therein, it was allegedly disparaging the
plaintiff's soap sold under the trade mark "DETTOL". Again in the said case,
the name of the plaintiff's product "Dettol" was not named in the said
advertisement. The learned Judge observed thus:
> "22. The question which needs resolution is: whether the orange soap shown
> in the advertisement could be said to have a reference to the DETTOL
> Original soap of the plaintiff. Ext. PW1/11 are some photographs extracted
> from the video clip of the said advertisement.

It will also be relevant to refer to the observations of the learned single
Judge, which read thus:
> "26. ................. In the case of disparagement, the one who disparages
> another's product, does not seek to make his product similar to the
> disparaged product, but to distinguish it from the disparaged product. The

> slandered."
12\. Again in the case of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd. v. Heinz
India (P) Ltd. (supra), the Delhi High Court had an occasion to consider the
advertisement of the defendant therein promoting its product "Complan" on the
ground that plaintiff's product "Horlicks" was sought to be disparaged.
However, since in the said case the product which was sought to be disparaged
was directly named, the said judgment would not be of much assistance so far
as present case is concerned.
13\. The Madras High Court, in Annamalayar Agencies v. VVS & Sons Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) had an occasion to consider an advertisement wherein the plaintiff's
product "Parachute Coconut Oil" was bottled in blue bottle, whereas
defendant's product "VVD Gold Coconut Oil" was bottled in a green bottle. The
advertisement No. 1 impugned in the said case shows two coconuts, one in green
colour and another in blue colour and an actress wearing green dress appears
on the scene and asks a  26/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on
- 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc question "which is natural?", and
then she herself picks up a green coconut and says that it is natural. In
advertisement No. 2, an actress wearing green dress picks up one of the green
colour plastic bottles of VVD arranged in a shelf and says this is 100% pure
and natural and this is what I want. Then the next shot shows an actress
wearing green dress in the foreground and the lady wearing blue saree in the
background. The lady wearing blue saree has a blue colour bottle in her left
hand and a VVD bottle in her right hand. She looks at the blue bottle which is
in her left hand and shakes her head disapprovingly and puts the bottle down.
Then she looks at the VVD bottle in the right hand and lifts the bottle up and
says VVD Gold, this is what I want. The learned Judge, observed thus:
> "33. Insofar as advertisements 2 and 3 are concerned, they definitely refer
> to a plain unnamed blue bottle and drives home a message that the blue
> bottle does not contain 100% pure and natural coconut oil whereas the 1st
> Defendant's product alone contain 100% pure and natural coconut oil. It is

> would send a wrong message to television viewers and the buyer of the
> coconut oil that the blue bottle products are inferior to that of green
> bottle products of the 1stDefendant, which is nothing but openly disparaging
> the product of the Plaintiff."
14\. The Calcutta High Court in the case of Reckitt & Colman of India Ltd. v.
M.P. Ramchandran (supra) had an occasion to consider the advertisement wherein
the product of the plaintiff "Robin Blue" was sought to be disparaged by the
defendant who was manufacturing the product whitener under the brand  27/46
::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP)
340-17.doc name "Ujala". In the said advertisement, the product whitener in
the bottle of dispenser with the word "blue" printed on it was disparaged by
showing disadvantages of the said product. It was the case of the defendant
therein that the plaintiff's product was Robin Liquid Blue whereas the bottle
of which dispenser was shown was an ordinary bottle of blue as such it was not
disparaging the product of the defendant. The learned judgment observed thus:
> "Therefore, in a suit of this nature one has to look at whether the

16\. In so far as order of Delhi High Court in the case of Hindustan Unilever
Ltd. v. SC Johnson & Sons(supra), the Court has clearly come to the conclusion
that when cleaning action is actually shown in the advertisement, an orange
bottle of the respondents or the similar orange bottle of some other
manufacturer was not shown but, in fact, a completely different blue bottle
was shown. In this background, the Division Bench found that there was nothing
in the advertisement to suggest that the product of the respondents was in any
manner disparaged or shown to be inferior to the product of the appellants. In
the circumstances, the order of injunction granted by the learned single Judge
was reversed.
17\. It can, thus, clearly be seen that it is a settled position of law that a
a tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the world, even
though the declaration is untrue. He can also say that his goods are better
than his competitors, even though such statement is untrue. He can also say
that his product is best in the world or better than his competitors' and also
can compare the advantages of his product over the products of the others.
However, while doing so, he cannot say his competitors are bad and, if he does
so, he really slanders the goods of his competitors and defames his
competitors and their goods which is not permissible and only in such a case
the Court would be competent to grant order of injunction restraining
repetition of such defamation."
"18. It is equally settled that to decide the question of disparagement, the
following factors are to be kept in mind:
> (i) Intent of commercial
> (ii) Manner of the commercial  31/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 :::
> Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc

> manner is ridiculing or condemning product of the competitor then it amounts
> to disparaging but if the manner is only to show one's product better or

It could thus be seen that for deciding the question of disparagement, Court
will have to take into consideration intent of the commercial, manner of the
commercial and storyline of the commercial and the message sought to be
conveyed by the commercial. We will also be required to consider as to whether
manner of the commercial is ridiculing or condemning product of the
competitor, to come to the conclusion that it amounts to disparagement.
However, if manner of the commercial only shows advertiser's product better or
best without derogating the other's product then the same would not amount to
disparagement.
25] We have reproduced hereinabove paragraphs from the impugned judgment and
order of the learned Single Judge, in which  32/46 ::: Uploaded on -
26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc
meaning of the commercial and graphic of the commercial has been considered.
From the perusal of TVCs, it is clear that the manner in which the
advertisement is aired, the message that is sought to be given is that the
frozen desserts are manufactured by using only Vanaspati tel i.e. hydrogenated
vegetable oil, which is harmful for the health. It is relevant to note from
the pleadings of the Appellant, that Appellant itself has not disputed that
the Vanaspati is harmful for health. It will be relevant to refer to some of
the averments made in para 18 of the affidavit in reply filed by one Sameer
Nagle on behalf of Defendant No.1, which read as under:-
> "18.........I say that oil necessarily is in liquid form and fat in solid
> form. I say that it is an admitted position that some Frozen Dessert
> manufacturers use Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil or Vanaspati........"
It is an admission of the Appellant that oil necessarily is in liquid form and
fat in solid form. When it is admitted by the Appellant that, what is used by
the majority of the manufacturers of frozen dessert, is vegetable oil, then we
do not understand as to how the Appellant can  33/46 ::: Uploaded on -
26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc
justify showing chunks of semi-solid substance in murky colour, falling in the
Cup of frozen dessert. It is clear that what is sought to be depicted is that
the frozen desserts are made out of hydrogenated vegetable oil i.e.
"Vanaspati", which is in semi-solid form. It will also be relevant to refer to
some of the the averments made in para 21 of the said affidavit, which read as
under:-
> "21.........I say that Defendant No.1 has only sought to inform and educate
> the consumers. I say that even Advertisement is a commercial speech
> recognized under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. What

As such, even according to the Appellant also, 70% of the manufacturers of the
frozen desserts, do not use Vanaspati or hydrogenated vegetable oil. It could
further be seen that it is clearly admitted by the Appellant that Vanaspati
has harmful effects. No doubt that, Appellant has sought to justify that the
advertisement has been aired only to educate the consumers with regard to
disadvantages of frozen desserts, which contain hydrogenated fat or
hydrogenated vegetable oil ordinarily known as Vanaspati. What the Appellant
desires to convey by the impugned TVCs is that, all manufacturers of Frozen
Desserts, including the Plaintiff, use Vanaspati i.e. hydrogenated vegetable
oil in manufacturing of its product. The said message is false to the
knowledge of the  35/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc Appellant. The Appellant has again
reiterated in subsequent paragraphs about the fact of Vanaspati i.e.
hydrogenated vegetable oil being harmful to health. However, we do not want to
burden our judgment by reproducing the repeated averments. 26] It could thus
be seen that, even according to the own admission of the Appellant,
hydrogenated fat or Vanaspati has harmful effects on the health. If, with this
knowledge, the Appellant has aired the impugned advertisement, showing that
all the manufacturers of frozen desserts use Vanaspati or Vanaspati tel, there
can be no manner of doubt that intent of the advertisement is to show that
Frozen Desserts are manufactured by using Vanaspati and that the said products
which are manufactured with the use of Vanaspati are dangerous to the health.
We have no manner of doubt, to hold that TVCs have an effect of disparaging
the frozen desserts in general and dissuading the class of consumers from
using it. As held in catena of cases, Appellant can verywell make a false
claim to puff up their product. It can also make statements which are not true
to its knowledge to show how its product is superior. It can even compare its
products with the competitors. However, the Appellant cannot be  36/46 :::

340-17.doc permitted to air the advertisement which disparages the product of
its competitors.
27] Having arrived at a finding that the impugned TVCS are in the nature of
disparaging the frozen desserts, we will deal with judgments on which reliance
is placed by Mr. Kadam.
28] Insofar as the judgment in the case of Reckit Benckisher (India) Limited
vs. Naga Limited and Ors 12 is concerned, the relief is refused to the
Plaintiff therein basically on the ground of conduct of the Plaintiff. In the
said case, the Plaintiff had not disclosed about the complaint filed by it
before ASCI and rejection thereof. According to Mr. Kadam, in the present case
also, there is similar situation. However, we have perused the averments in
the plaint and in the plaint, there is a specific reference to the proceedings
before ASCI. In that view of the matter, we find that the said judgment would
not be applicable to the facts of the present case.
29] Again, in the case of Godrej Sara Lee Ltd. vs. Reckitt 12 ILR (2003) I
DELHI 325  37/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018
06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc Benckiser (I) Ltd. 13, the Court has referred to
the judgment of Calcutta High Court in Reckitt & Colman of India Ltd. vs. M.P.
Ramchandran and Anr reported as 1999 PTC (19) 741, which has laid down the
principles on which action on the basis of disparagement could be based. As
discussed hereinabove, if the advertisement had restricted itself to puffing
up the product of the Appellant or showing its product to be the best one or
rested on comparing its product, there would have been no issue. However, the
advertisement shows that, it had not stopped at that and the Appellant has
shown the product of the Plaintiff in poor light, and has attempted to show
that frozen desserts were harmful to health. As such, the said judgment would
also not be applicable to the facts of the present case. 30] In so far as
reliance placed by Mr. Kadam, on the Judgment of Delhi High Court in Dabur
India Ltd vs. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.14 is concerned, it will be
relevant to refer to para 14 of the said judgment which reads as under:-
"14. On the basis of the law laid down by the 13 2006 (32) PTC 307 (Del) 14
2010 SCC OnLine Del 391  38/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on
- 27/12/2018 06:37:41 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc Supreme Court, the guiding
principles for us should be the following:
> (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is protected by Article (19)
> (1)(a) of the Constitution.
> (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair or deceptive.
> (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but these need not
> necessarily be taken as serious representations of fact but only as
> glorifying one's product."
It could thus be seen that the said judgment rather than supporting the case
of the Appellant, would support the case of the Plaintiff, inasmuch as, it
clearly holds that the advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair or
deceptive. The Delhi High Court further held that protection of Article
19(1)(a) is available to the advertisement. However, if an advertisement
extends beyond grey areas and becomes a false, misleading, unfair or deceptive
advertisement, it would certainly not have the benefit of any protection. It
has further been held by Delhi High Court that while comparing its product
with other products, the advertiser may only highlight its positive points,
but this cannot be negatively construed to mean that there is a disparagement
39/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:41 :::
(APP) 340-17.doc of a rival product. It has been further held that while
hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress the grey areas
of permissible assertion, and if it does so, the advertiser must have some
reasonable factual basis for the assertion so made. 31] So far as the other
judgments of the Delhi High Court are concerned, the said judgments are
delivered by the learned Single Judges of the Delhi High Court. We have
already referred to the view taken by Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
and as such, we do not find that reference to all the judgments of the learned
Single Judges of that Court would be necessary.
32] In that view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the view
taken by the learned Single Judge to arrive at a finding that the impugned
TVCs are in the nature of disparaging the frozen desserts, in which market the
Plaintiff has substantial share and as such, the Plaintiff is entitled to
injunction, does not warrant interference.
40/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:42 :::
(APP) 340-17.doc 33] The only question that we are now required to consider
is, as to whether the extent of injunction as granted by the learned Single
Judge is warranted in the facts of the present case or not. 34] The learned
Single Judge has granted twofold injunctions. In clause (i) of the operative
part of the judgment, he has restrained the Appellant from telecasting or
broadcasting or otherwise howsoever communicating to the public or publishing
the impugned TVCs or any part thereof or any other advertisement of a similar
nature in any language or in any manner causing the impugned TVCs or any part
thereof or any other advertisement of a similar nature to be telecast or
broadcast or communicated to the public or published in any manner.
35] We are of the view that such a blanket injunction could not have been
granted by the learned Single Judge. Perusal of the advertisement would reveal
that, entire TVC cannot be said to be of objectionable nature. The learned
Single Judge has reproduced the snap-shots of advertisement in detail, in para
10. We find that insofar as the first TVC is concerned, the snap-shots from
'A' to 'G'  41/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018
06:37:42 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc cannot be said to be disparaging the product
"Frozen Desserts". At the most, what could be said is that the Appellant is
trying to highlight the benefits of its product or puff it up or try to show
that it is the best one. The message sought to be given is that, the product
of the Appellant is made of pure milk and therefore only such product should
be given to the brave girls like Shriya. As already held hereinabove,
Appellant is entitled to show its product in highest esteem and no one could
have objection to that. However, from snap- shots 'H', 'I' and 'J' read in
conjunction with 'H' and 'I', an attempt is not only made to compare the
product of the Appellant with frozen desserts, but message is sought to be
given that entire class of frozen desserts is made using only Vanaspati i.e.
hydrogenated vegetable oil and that consumer should have only ice creams and
not the Frozen Desserts. In that view of the matter, we find that insofar as
the first TVC is concerned, the injunction could have been granted only to
part beginning from snap-shots 'H' to 'J'.
36] Similarly, insofar as second TVC is concerned, there could be no objection
in respect of snap-shots 1 to 7, which are on similar lines with snap-shots
'A' to 'G' in first TVC. However, snap-shots 8 to  42/46 ::: Uploaded on -
26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:42 ::: (APP) 340-17.doc 10 are
similar with snap-shots 'H' 'I' and 'J' in the first TVC which attempt to
disparage the Frozen Desserts.
37] We further find that the width of the injunction granted in impugned
judgment and order, by using the word "similar" is also likely to create
complications. We are of the considered view, that the injunction should have
been granted only insofar as the part which is found to be disparaging and the
word "similar" should have been used in the context of parts which are found
to be disparaging. We therefore find, that clause (i) of the operative part of
the impugned judgment needs to be modified.
38] Insofar as clause (ii) of the operative part of the impugned judgment is
concerned, the learned Single Judge has injuncted the Defendant No.1 from
disparaging or denigrating the Plaintiff's KWALITY WALL'S products (including
Frozen Desserts manufactured or sold under the said brand and sub-brands
thereof) or the Plaintiff's business in any manner whatsoever. We are of the
considered view that the said part of the injunction travels beyond the scope
of the Notice of Motion as well as the suit. The suit has basically impugned
43/46 ::: Uploaded on - 26/12/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 27/12/2018 06:37:42 :::
(APP) 340-17.doc two TVCs. There is no pleadings or material placed on record
that the Appellant, in any manner whatsoever, is doing an act, except the said
TVCs, which is disparaging or denigrating Plaintiff's product including frozen
desserts etc. Nothing is placed on record to show that the Appellant is doing
anything so as to disparage or denigrate the Plaintiff's business. The only
averments in the plaint are with regard to disparaging effect of the impugned
TVCs. We are of the considered view that the learned Single Judge should have
restricted the injunction only insofar as subject matter which was impugned
before him. We are of the view that such a wide relief could not have been
granted without there being any pleadings or material in support thereof. In
that view of the matter, we find that injunction insofar as clause (ii) of the
operative part of the impugned judgment and order is concerned is not
sustainable in law.
39] In the result, appeal is partly allowed in the following terms:-
> (I) Finding of the learned Single Judge that TVC-1 and TVC-2 amounts to

portion, which has been found to be disparaging the product Frozen Desserts
i.e. snaps-shots 'H', 'I' and 'J' in the first TVC and snap-shots 8 to 10 in
the second TVC.
(III) The word "similar", which has been used in clause

clarified to be 'as similar' to the parts of the advertisement which have been
found to be disparaging the product Frozen Desserts.
(IV) Clause (ii) of the operative part of the impugned judgment of the learned
