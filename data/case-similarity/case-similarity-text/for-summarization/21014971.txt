PER BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER Present cross appeals has been filed by
assessee as well as revenue against order passed by Ld.DCIT, Circle 12(2)
under section 143(3) read with section 144C(13) of the act for assessment year
2009-10 on following grounds of appeal: ITA No. 110/B/2014 "I. Transfer
Pricing
1\. The learned Assessing Officer ("learned AO") and the learned Deputy
Commissioner of Income Tax (Transfer Pricing-II), Bangalore ("Transfer Pricing
Officer" or the "learned TPO") grossly erred in making an adjustment to the
transfer pricing of the Appellant with respect to the ITeS services by Rs.
3,84,85,382.
2\. The learned AO/learned TPO erred in rejecting the Transfer Pricing ("TP")
documentation maintained by the Appellant on invoking provisions of sub-
section (3) of 92C of the Act contending that the information or data used in
the computation of arm's length price is not reliable or correct. In doing so:
2.1. the learned AO/learned TPO erred in rejection of comparability analysis
carried in the TP documentation and in conducting a fresh comparability
analysis by introducing various filters in determining the arm's length price.
2.2. the learned AO/learned TPO erred in rejecting companies that are
comparable to the Appellant while performing the comparability analysis.
Specifically, the Appellant believes that the following companies should have
been included as comparable • Lee & Nee Software (Exports) Limited • Caliber
Point Business Solutions Limit • R Systems International Limited ~7 2.3. The
learned AO/learned TPO erred in including companies that do not satisfy the V
test of comparability. Specifically, the Appellant believes that the following
companies selected as comparable by the learned AO/ learned TPO should be
rejected.

                                       IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014

        *      Accentia Technologies Limited
        *      Cosmic Global Limited
       *       Eelerx Services Limited
3\. The learned AO/learned TPO erred in computing mark-up for Alisec
Technologies Limited by erroneously considering the provision for bad and
doubtful debts as non- operating in nature.
4\. The learned AO/learned TPO erred in not considering the multiple
year/prior year financial data of comparable companies while determining the
arm's length price.
5\. The learned AO/learned TPO erred in using data as at the time of
assessment proceedings, instead of that available as on the date of preparing
the TP documentation for comparable companies while determining arm's length
price.
6\. The learned AO/learned TPO erred in ignoring the limited risk nature of
the contractual services provided by the Appellant and in not providing an
appropriate adjustment towards the risk differential, even when the full-
fledged entrepreneurial companies are selected as comparable companies II. Re-
computation of deduction under section 1OA of the Act by adjusting the Export
Turnover and Total Turnover
7\. The learned AO erred in re-computing deduction under section 10A of the
Act by reducing an amount of Rs. 7,50,000 from the export turnover and total
turnover which were incurred by the assessee towards telecommunication
expenses.
8\. The learned AO erred in not appreciating the fact that the
telecommunication expenses cannot be reduced from the export turnover and
total turnover as the same is incurred during the course of the normal
business activity and cannot be separately attributed to the delivery of
software outside India.
III. Re-computation of deduction under section 10AA of the Act by adjusting
the Export Turnover and Total Turnover
9\. The learned AO erred in re-computing deduction under section 10AA of the
Act by reducing an amount of Rs.13,159,696 from the export turnover and total
turnover which were incurred by the assessee towards telecommunication
expenses.
10\. The learned AO erred in not appreciating the fact that the
telecommunication expenses cannot be reduced from the export turnover and
total turnover as the same is incurred during the course of the normal
business activity and cannot be separately attributed to the delivery of
software outside India.

IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 The appellant craves leave to add, alter,
rescind and modify the grounds herein above or produce further documents,
facts and evidence before or at the time of hearing of this appeal.
For the above and any other grounds which may be raised at the time of
hearing, it is prayed that necessary relief may be provided." ITA No.
77/B/2014 "1. The directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel are opposed to
law and facts of the case.
2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Dispute Resolution
Panel erred in law in directing the AO to exclude the Broadband charges and
travel expenses both from the export turnover as well as from total turnover
for the purpose of computation of deduction u/s 10A, without appreciating the
fact that the statute allows exclusion of such expenditure only from export
turnover by way of specific definition of export turnover as envisaged by Sub-
clause (4) of Explanation 2 below Sub-section (8) of Section 10A and the total
turnover has not been defined in this Section.
3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Dispute Resolution
Panel erred in directing the AO to compute deduction u/s 10A in the above
manner by placing reliance on the decision of Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka
in the case of M/s Tata Elxsi Ltd., which has not become final since the same
has not been accepted by the Department and SLPs are pending before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court.
4\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, as per the directions
of the Dispute Resolution Panel, whether working capital adjustment can be
made on the basis of advance received from AEs in absence of debtors and
inventory in the case of assessee for calculating the cost of working capital
built in the profit margin.
5\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Dispute Resolution
Panel is not justified in directing the TPO to adjust the profit margin of the
assessee for the entire amount of advances received from AE on the ground that
there is time value for money."
Brief facts of the case are as under:
2\. Assessee is a company and has filed its original return of income for year
under consideration on 28/09/2009. Subsequently the return was revised on
09/04/2010 declaring taxable income of Rs.2,5499,721/-. Return was processed
under  Page 5 of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 section 143(1) of the Act
and was selected for scrutiny. Ld.AO issued notice under section 143(2) and
142(1), in response to which representative of assessee appeared before Ld.AO
and filed requisite details as called for.
3\. From the details filed us, Ld.AO observed that assessee had international
transactions with associated enterprises for more than Rs.15 crores.
Accordingly as per the provisions of the act reference to transfer pricing
officer was made for determination of arm's length price of international
transaction. On receipt of reference under section 92CA of the Act, Ld.TPO
called upon assessee to file economic details of international transaction in
Form 3 CEB. From details filed, Ld.TPO observed that, assessee had following
international transaction with its associated enterprise:
          Type of transaction        Amount Paid         Amount
                                            (Rs)      Received (Rs)
      Back Office Services (ITES)                         68,28,43,287
    Reimbursement of expenses             32,85,609         1,41,15,132
4\. Ld.TPO noted that, assessee operated as an offshore processing Centre for
its associated enterprise in U.S. and also renders similar services to
customers in India. It was noted by Ld.TPO that assessee is a part of BPO
group. Business Process Outsourcing Inc.,Cayman Island, the ultimate holding
company of the group. Ld.TPO noted that assessee has two units, one in  Page 6
of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 Bangalore and other in Delhi being 100%
export oriented unit and operates from SEZ.
5\. Ld.TPO noted that assessee used TNMM as most appropriate method and OP/OC
as PLI to compute its margin at 15.67%. It had used following 8 comparables
with an average margin of 14.34% on cost.:
    S.No.                    Particulars                      Margin
    1.       Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide Ltd

    7.       Caliber Point Business Solutions Ltd
    8.       MSource India Pvt. Ltd.
6\. Assessee thus held its transaction to be at arms length margin.

         6        Informed Technologies India Ltd.        22.61%

                        AVERAGE PLI                       25.03%
    7.   Ld.TPO    rejected    the     Transfer   Pricing       documentation
maintained by assessee and by applying various filters and rejected for
comparables selected by assessee. Ld.TPO carried out fresh search and selected
a final set of following 8 comparables having average PLI of 25.03%:
8\. Ld.TPO also restricted the working capital adjustment at 0.91% and did not
grant risk adjustment to assessee. He thus computed the proposed adjustment
being shortfall at Rs.5,08,97,427/-.
9\. Ld.AO while passing the draft assessment order reworked the exemption
claimed by assessee under section 10A of the Act. Ld.AO excluded
telecommunication charges from export turnover. He also rejected the
submission of assessee that on this issue Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case
of CIT vs Tata LXE directed to exclude the same item from the total turnover.
Ld.AO thus proposed addition of Rs.5,26,08,958/- in the hands of assessee.

IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014
10\. Aggrieved by the addition proposed by Ld.AO assessee objected before DRP.
11\. Before DRP assessee had raised objections in respect of inclusion of
certain comparables which were rejected. DRP upheld the action of Ld.TPO/AO in
respect of the addition proposed.
12\. DRP also directed to retained the export turnover and total turnover as
observed by Ld.AO in the draft assessment order for purposes of computing
deduction under section 10A of the Act. On receipt of DRP direction, Ld.AO
passed final assessment order. However, Ld.AO corrected some clerical error in
mentioning the figure of deduction under section 10A in adopting the export
turnover and the profit of the undertaking.
13\. Aggrieved by the addition made by Ld.AO in the final assessment order,
assessee is in appeal before us now.
14\. Ld.AR referred to grounds filed on 12/12/2019. He submitted that, in the
event following comparables alleged in respective grounds are considered
assessee would be within the margin as required:
• It has been submitted by Ld.AR that in Ground No.2.2 assessee only wish to
argue on inclusion of R systems international Ltd • Ld.AR wishes to argue
exclusion of 4 comparables raised in Ground 2.3. He submitted that 2
comparables may be considered on functional dissimilarities.
Page 9 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 • Assessee has also raised in Additional Ground
No.7, wherein, it has been raised that, adjustment on account of difference in
the rate of depreciation charged by assessee vis-a-vis comparables needs to be
provided. It is a submission of Ld.AR that with adjudication of these issues
assessee would be within the margin of +/-5%.
15\. In respect of corporate ground issue being Ground No.7-10 assessee
submits that revenue is also in appeal in support of the order passed by
Ld.AO. It has been submitted that this issue is in respect of computation of
export turnover and total turnover for purposes of deduction to be determined
under section 10A & 10AA of the Act.
16\. We shall 1st deal with corporate tax issues raised by assessee as well as
revenue.
17\. Ground No.II-III in assessee's appeal and Ground No.2-5 in revenue's
appeal are in respect of deduction to be computed under section 10A/AA of the
Act.
18\. We note that challenged by revenue for excluding communication expenses
for computing total turnover and export turnover and excluding loss earned
from non-eligible unit for purposes of 10A deduction.
19\. We note that DRP referred to decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court, in
the case of CIT v. Tata Elxsi Ltd. reported in [2012] 17 taxmann.com 100 held
that, if any expenditure is excluded from export turnover, then the same needs
to be excluded from  Page 10 of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 total
turnover as well, accordingly, directing Ld.AO to exclude expenses deducted
from export turnover from total turnover for computing deduction u/s 10A of
the Income-tax Act, 1961.
20\. Further in respect of exclusion of loss earned from non- eligible unit
for computing profits of eligible unit under section 10 A, DRP relied on
decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case of and CIT v. Yokogava India
Ltd. reported in [2012] 21 taxmann.com 154.
21\. We do not find any infirmity in the view taken by DRP as it is supported
by ratios held by Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court. There is nothing on
record brought by revenue to establish any distinguishing factors to deviate
from the ratio of Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court.
22\. Ld.AO however has not computed the same in the manner as directed by DRP.
23\. We therefore direct Ld.AO to follow the ratio laid down by Hon'ble
jurisdictional High Court in case of CIT v. Yokogava India Ltd. (supra). It is
also mentioned that this view has been fortified by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of CIT v. HCL Technologies Ltd. reported in (2018) 93 taxmann.com 33 and
DCIT vs Citrix R&D India private limited reported in (2019) 104 taxmann.com
85. We therefore allow Ground No.II-III in assessee's appeal and dismiss
Ground No.2-5 in revenue's appeal.
24\. Assessee's appeal in respect of trans-apprising issues are in respect of
in exclusion/inclusion of following comparables.
Page 11 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014
1\. Assessee in Ground 2.2 seeks inclusion of R.S.Systems international Ltd
2\. Assessee in Ground 2.3 seeks exclusion of Infosys BPO Ltd, Accentia
Technologies Ltd., Cosmic Global Ltd., and Eclerx Services Ltd.
25\. Before carrying out comparability analysis, it is sine qua non to
understand functions performed, assets owned and risk assumed by assessee
under this segment.
A. Functions:
In the TP study placed at page 3837-382 of paper book, it has been stated that
assessee is an offshore processing Centre of U.S. AE. Assessee has an indie
genius arm which caters to tax advisors and financial services. It has been
submitted that it is engaged in BPO activities to the associated enterprises.
It functions to ensure proper migration of process from client to assessee,
prepared documentation for the process, provide back office transaction
processing services to its AE, ensures quality of services, identification of
manpower requirement, recruitment of manpower and training, assignment of
qualified professionals on project.
It has been submitted that assessee performs general oversight activities
which is known "stewardship" activities. B. Asset owned:
Page 12 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 It has been submitted that assessee owns primary
assets assets for providing back-office services like employees,
infrastructure and workstations etc. C. Risk assumed.
In TP study it has been submitted that assessee undertakes risk of delivering
quality product, risk of financing the work capital, risk of appropriately
trained human skill sets facility risk and communication risk etc. Based upon
above FAR, assessee has been characterised as a low risk service provider
providing BPO/ITES services and assuming negligible risk in course of its
business with some material and supervisory assistance from the associated
enterprises. We shall now consider the comparables alleged for
exclusion/inclusion by assessee.
26\. Ground No. 2.2:
Assessee is seeking inclusion of 1 comparable being R Systems International
Ltd in this ground.
There are 2 more comparables alleged for inclusion however, at the time of
hearing, Ld.AR submitted that they are not pressed. Accordingly, except for R
Systems International Ltd., other comparables raised in this ground are not
adjudicated as not pressed.
R Systems International Ltd.
This comparable has been excluded by Ld.TPO, as it has a different accounting
period.
Page 13 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 This Tribunal has been taking consistent view
regarding this comparable. Ld.AR submitted that data for relevant financial
years can be derived from the quarterly data available on the website of the
company and therefore this comparable should be included in the finalist. In
support of his submission, placed reliance on order passed by this Tribunal in
assessee's own case for preceding assessment year (supra).
Ld. ACIT DR placed reliance on order passed by authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
It is noted that this comparable has been restored to Ld.AO/TPO in preceding
assessment years by this Tribunal in assessee's own case. We direct assessee
to file the relevant data for financial year from the data available on the
website so that Ld.AO/TPO can examine the details.
Accordingly we remand this comparable to Ld.AO/TPO for verification and
inclusion the finalist.
Accordingly this ground stands partly allowed.
27\. Ground No.2.3 Infosys BPO Ltd Ld. AR submitted that this comparable is
functionally different with that of assessee. It is also been submitted that
extraordinary events like amalgamation has taken place in case of this
comparable. Ld. AR submitted that this comparable is a  Page 14 of 26 IT(TP)A
No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 subsidiary of Infosys Ltd and possesses brand value.
This comparable has been spending on brand building and advertisement so as to
enhance is brand over the years. Ld. ar thus submitted that this comparable
cannot be compared with a captive service provider like that of assessee. On
the contrary Ld. CIT DR relied on orders passed by authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
Admittedly, this company has a huge brand value. We also note that this
company is a very high turnover and various decisions of coordinate bench of
this Tribunal has rejected this comparable by applying turnover filter. We
notice that Ld. TPO had applied comparable less than Rs.1 crore filter for
excluding certain comparables however has not applied the upper limit for the
filter. Consistently this Tribunal has been excluding comparables with more
than 200 crores turnover as not comparable with a captive service provider
like assessee. On perusal of the order passed by this Tribunal in assessee's
own case for preceding assessment year, this comparable has been excluded by
applying turnover filter. There has been no factual changes for year under
consideration and therefore we do not find any reason to deviate from the
consistent approach taken by this Tribunal in assessee's own case.
Accordingly, we direct to excluded this comparable.
Page 15 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 Accentia Technologies Ltd.
Ld.AR submitted that, this comparable is functionally different with that of
assessee as it is engaged in medical transcription, medical coding, billing
and engaged in healthcare activities. He also submitted that, there has been
extraordinary event during the years under consideration being acquisition of
96% stake in M/s oak technologies Inc.. It has been submitted by Ld. ar that
this comparable is also into software product development. For all the
relevant segments under which this comparable is generating revenue, there is
no segmental details available. Ld.AR pointed out from the annual report
placed at page 32-40 and 60 of paper book that this company has made
investments and other companies and has entered into strategy tie ups for
raising long-term funds for expansion of the company. On the contrary,
Ld.CIT.DR relied on orders passed by authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us. We note that for assessment year 2011- 12, this Tribunal excluded
this comparable by observing that it operates in a different business strategy
of acquiring companies for inorganic growth. No doubt that this comparable has
been acquiring various companies as a matter of its internal strategy for
expansion thereby causing an extraordinary event which impacts profits of this
company.
Page 16 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 Following consistent approach taken in
assessee's own case, we direct Ld.AO/TPO to exclude this comparable from the
finalist.
Cosmic Global Ltd.
this comparable has been selected by Ld.AO/TPO, however Ld.AR submitted that
it is engaged in providing services of medical transcription and consultancy,
translation services and accounts BPO. The Ld.AR submitted that this
comparable has earned major revenue through translation services. The Ld.AR
further submitted that this comparable does not satisfy the employee cost to
sales ratio filter which was considered by Ld.TPO in selecting the
comparables. He submitted that, minimum threshold of employee cost filter
should be at least 25% of sales, however in the present comparable it is only
21.95%. On the contrary Ld. CIT DR submitted that in the preceding years this
comparable was never objected by assessee for exclusion.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
Though assessee has submitted in the chart that this comparable is submitted
to be functionally different, however, before us LdAR could not demonstrate
how the functions are not similar. In our view, segment that needs to be
considered in present facts is the BPO segment, that has turnover of Rs. 27.76
lakhs. The turnover of assessee in the present case is 68.28 Lacs. We note
that Ld.AR  Page 17 of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 has placed reliance on
decision of e4e Business Solutions India Pvt. Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2016)
67 taxmann.com 68 , wherein, this comparable was excluded by relying on
decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in case of Lam Research (India)
(P) Ltd vs DCIT in ITA No. 1437/B/2014 dated 30/04/2014: 11.4Cosmic Global
Ltd.
The learned AR of the assessee submitted that the assessee raised objection
against inclusion of this company in the list of comparables before the TPO on
the ground that this company has major revenue from translation services.
Therefore, this company is functionally different from the services provided
by the assessee to its AE. The learned AR of the assessee has referred to the
Annual report of this company and submitted that that out of the total revenue
of Rs. 7,37,02,584/-, this company has earned revenue from translation charges
to the tune of Rs. 6,99,35,756/-. Therefore, substantial part of the revenue
has been earned from the activity of translation. The learned AR of the
assessee has further pointed out that even otherwise this company is
outsourcing the work of translation as it is evident from the profit and loss
account of this company that an amount of Rs. 3,00,25,326/- has been paid on
account of translation charges. Thus, learned AR of the assessee has submitted
that this company cannot be considered as functionally comparable with the
assessee for the purpose of determining the ALP. In support of his contention,
he has relied upon the decision of the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in
the case of Lam Research (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT in ITA No.
1437/Bang/2014 dated 30/4/2015.
(i) On the other hand, learned Departmental Representative has submitted that
the comparability of this company has been examined by the TPO as well as by
the DRP. The TPO has rejected the objections raised by the assessee in respect
of this company by holding that the translation service are in the nature of
ITeS and therefore, it qualifies all the filters applied by the TPO. He has
relied upon the orders of the authorities below.
(ii) We have considered the rival submissions as well as the relevant material
on record. There is no dispute that this company is in the business of
providing service of medical transcription and consultancy services,
translations services and accounts BPO. The segmental revenue from the
operations are given in schedule 8 to the  Page 18 of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 &
110/Bang/2014 Profit & Loss account which reveals that major revenue of Rs.
6,99,35,756/- out of total revenue of Rs. 7.37 crores has been earned by this
company from the activity of translation services. We further note that the
company has debited an expenditure of more than Rs. 3 crore on account of
translations charges paid. Thus it is clear that this company is outsourcing
its services of translation work which is the main activity of this company
yielding major revenue earned during the year. Thus it is manifest from the
record that this company is in the entirely different nature of activity and
cannot be compared with the activity of providing contact centre of the
assessee to its AE. In the case of Lam Research (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra) the
co- ordinate bench of this Tribunal had occasion to examine the comparability
of this company in para. 34 as under:
"34. With respect to Cosmic Global Ltd., Hyderabad bench of ITAT in the case
of Capital IQ Information Systems (India) P. Ltd., in para 19 of its order,
had held as under:
Cosmic Global Ltd.
19\. The main objection of assessee with reference to the inclusion of this
company is with reference to outsourcing of its main activity. Even though
this company is in assessee's TP study, it has raised objection before the TPO
that this company's employee cost is less than 21.30% and most of the cost is
with reference to the outsourcing charges or translation charges, and as such
this is not a comparable company. The TPO, though considered these
submissions, rejected the same, on the reason that this does not impact the
profit margin of the company. Opposing the view taken by the TPO, it is
submitted that this company cannot be selected as comparable, as M/s. Capital
IQ Information systems (India) Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad similar issue was
discussed by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal(Delhi) in the case of Mercer
Consulting (India) P. Ltd. (supra), vide paras 13.2 to 13.3 which read as
under- 13.2. Now coming to the factual matrix of this case, we find from the
material on record that outsourcing charges of this case constitute 57.31% of
the total operating costs. This does not appear to us to be a valid reason for
eliminating this case from the list of comparables. On going through the
Annual accounts of Cosmic Global Limited, a copy of which has been placed on
record, we find that its total revenue from operations are at Rs. 7.37 crore
divided into three segments, namely, Medical transcription and consultancy
services at Rs. 9.90 lacs, Translation charges at Rs. 6.99 crore and Accounts
BPO at Rs. 27.76 lac. The Id. AR has made out a case that  Page 19 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 outsourcing activity carried out by this company
constitutes 57% of total expenses. The reason for which we are not agreeable
with the Id. AR is that we have to examine the revenue of this case only from
Accounts BPO segment and not on the entity level, being also from Medical
transcription and Translation charges. When we are examining the results of
this company from the Accounts BPO segment alone, there is no need to examine
the position under other segments. The entire outsourcing is confined to
Translation charges paid at Rs. 3.00 crore, which is strictly in the realm of
the Translation segment, revenues from which are to the tune of Rs. 6.99
crore. If this segment of Translation is not under consideration for deciding
as to whether this case is comparable or not, we cannot take recourse to the
figures which are relevant for segments other than accounts BPO. Thus it is
held that this case cannot be excluded on the strength of outsourcing
activity, which is alien to the relevant segment.
13.3 However, we find this case to incomparable on the alternative argument
advanced by the Id. AR to the effect that total revenue of the Accounts BPO
segment of Cosmic Global Limited is very low at Rs. 27. 76 lacs. We have
discussed this aspect above in the context of CG-VAK's case and held that a
captive unit cannot be compared with a giant case and thus excluded CG-VAK
with turnover from Accounts BPO segment at Rs. 86.10 lacs. As the segmental
revenue of BPO segment of Cosmic Global Limited at Rs. 27. 76 lac is still on
much lower side, the reasons given above would fully apply to hold Cosmic
Global Limited as incomparable. This case is, therefore, directed to be
excluded from the list of comparables. In view of the detailed analysis of the
coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in the above referred case, in this case also
we accept the contentions of assessee and direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to
exclude this comparable for the same reasons.
Accordingly, we direct that Cosmic Global Ltd., also be excluded from the list
of comparables."
Respectfully following the same we direct Ld. AO/TPO to exclude this
comparable from the final list.
Eclerx Services Ltd.
Page 20 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 This comparable was selected by Ld.TPO. However
Ld.AR submitted that this comparable is functionally different as it is
engaged in high-end services and therefore is not comparable with a captive
service provider like that of assessee. He submitted that this comparable is
basically provides services into knowledge process segments and not a back-
office service provider like that of assessee. He placed reliance on
observations of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in case of e4e Business
Solutions India Pvt.Ltd vs DCIT (supra).
On the contrary learn CIT DR placed reliance on orders passed by authorities
below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
We note that coordinate bench of this tribunal in respect of this comparable
observed as under:
11.2Eclerx Services Ltd.
The learned AR of the assessee has submitted that this company is engaged in
the high-end services and therefore, this company is basically a KPO and not a
BPO. He has referred to Annual Report of this company at page 26 of the paper
book -II and submitted that as it is clear from the Annual Report that this
company is a knowledge process outsourcing (K. P. O) providing data analytics
and data process solutions to global enterprise clients. This company supports
core and complex activities for its clients using proprietary processes and a
scalable offshore delivery model. This company has access to the capital
market and therefore, this company is a public listed KPO company in India.
The company is also engaged in consulting services and process outsourcing as
well as in the activity of process re- engineering and automation apart from
middle office and back office support to capital market. Therefore, keeping in
the diversified high-end services, this company cannot be considered as
functionally comparable with the assessee. In support of his  Page 21 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 contention, he has relied upon the decision of
the Special Bench of the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Maersk Global Centres
(India) (P.) Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT [2014] 43 taxmann.com 100/147 ITD 83.
(i) On the other hand, learned Departmental Representative has submitted that
this company is undisputedly in the business of ITeS and therefore, the
nomenclature that of KPO will not make it functionally different from the
assessee. He has relied upon the orders of the authorities below.
(ii) We have considered the rival submissions as well as relevant material on
record. We find that the company Eclerx Services Ltd. is engaged in
diversified activity of providing services including analytic services and
data process solutions to its global clients. The service provided by Eclerx
Services Ltd., is in various areas including capital market and therefore, the
services are in the nature of consultancy and end to end support through trade
centre including trade confirmation, settlement, transaction, maintenance and
analytic and reporting. Thus it is apparent from the nature of the activity of
this company that it is not providing a simple service of data processing but
it is engaged in the activity of providing high-end services involving
decision making analysis which requires thought process and evaluation of
various facts and factors. Functional comparability of this company with that
of simple BPO's service providing company has been examined by the Special
Bench in the case of Maersk Global Centres (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra) in
paras.82 & 83 as under :
82\. In so far as M/s eClerx Services Limited is concerned, the relevant
information is available in the form of annual report for financial year
2007-08 placed at page 166 to 183 of the paper book. A perusal of the same
shows that the said company provides data analytics and data process solutions
to some of the largest brands in the world and is recognized as experts in
chosen markets-financial services and retail and manufacturing. It is claimed
to be providing complete businesssolutions by combining people, process
improvement and automation. It is claimed to have employed over 1500 domain
specialists working for the clients. It is claimed that eClerx is a different
company with industry  Page 22 of 26 IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 specialized
services for meeting complex client needs, data analytics KPO service provider
specializing in two business verticals financial services and retail and
manufacturing. It is claimed to be engaged in providing solutions that do not
just reduce cost, but help the clients increase sales and reduce risk by
enhancing efficiencies and by providing valuable insights that empower better
decisions. M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. is also claimed to have a scalable
delivery model and solutions offered that include data analytics, operations
management, audits and reconciliation, metrics management and reporting
services. It also provides tailored process outsourcing and management
services along with a multitude of data aggregation, mining and maintenance
services. It is claimed that the company has a team dedicated to developing
automation tools to support service delivery. These software automation tools
increase productivity, allowing customers to benefit from further cost saving
and output gains with better control over quality. Keeping in view the nature
of services rendered by M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. and its functional
profile, we are of the view that this company is also mainly engaged in
providing high-end services involving specialized knowledge and domain
expertise in the field and the same cannot be compared with the assessee
company which is mainly engaged in providing low- end services to the group
concerns.
83\. For the reasons given above, we are of the view that if the functions
actually performed by the assessee company for its AEs are compared with the
functional profile of M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. and Mold-Tec Technologies
Ltd., it is difficult to find out any relatively equal degree of comparability
and the said entities cannot be taken as comparables for the purpose of
determining ALP of the transactions of the assessee company with its AEs. We,
therefore, direct that these two entities be excluded from the list of 10
comparables finally taken by the AO/TPO as per the direction of the DRP.
From the above it is clear that this comparable has held to be not comparable
with a low end BPO company like that of assessee.
Page 23 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 Accordingly we direct Ld. AO/TPO to exclude this
comparable from final list.
Accordingly this ground stands allowed.
28\. Additional Ground No.7:
Assessee raised Additional Ground No.7, vide application dated August 2016
wherein, it is submitted that, assessee's assets depreciates at higher rate,
and therefore necessary adjustment needs to be provided in respect of
depreciation cost in case of comparables, to bridge disparities between final
set of comparables and assessee. Admittedly, this issue has been raised before
this Tribunal for 1st time. Assessee submitted that, there is a significant
difference in the rate of depreciation cost between assessee and the
comparables.
It has been submitted by Ld.AR that this issue has been considered by
coordinate bench of this Tribunal in assessee's own case in IT(TP)
No.443/Bang/2016, by order dated 31/10/2017 has remanded the issue to
Ld.TPO/AO for re-examination based on details filed by assessee regarding
difference in depreciation. This Tribunal also observed that, adjustment on
account of accelerated depreciation has been granted to assessee in the
preceding years.
Ld.AR thus prayed for admission of the ground. On the contrary, Ld.CIT DR
submitted that this issue was never considered by authorities below and no new
ground could be raised before this Tribunal now.
Page 24 of 26
IT(TP)A No.77 & 110/Bang/2014 We have perused the records and orders passed by
this Tribunal. ALP needs to be computed by removing differences between
assessee and comparables, that could have a baring on the cost. In preceding
years, adjustment on accelerated depreciation had been granted to assessee
subject to verification. We therefore are of the opinion that though this
issue has been raised for the first time, it needs to be considered. We are
therefore admitting this Ground.
We remit this issue for being considered by Ld.AO/TPO. Assessee shall
demonstrate the difference in rate of depreciation charged in case of assessee
as well as the comparables. This shall be examined by Ld.AO/TPO and if it is
found that the rates of depreciation are different between assessee and
comparables, reasonable depreciation adjustment should be granted. Needless to
say that proper opportunity of being heard must be granted to assessee.
Accordingly, Additional Ground no.7 raised by assessee stands allowed for
statistical purposes.
