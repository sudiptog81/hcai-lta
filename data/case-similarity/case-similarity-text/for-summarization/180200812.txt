                            HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                             W.P.(C) Nos.22471 & 28896 of 2011

                                             -Versus-
            State of Orissa and others                                ...    Opp. Parties
                      For Petitioners            :      M/s. S. P. Mishra, Sr. Advocate,

                     For Opp. Parties            :      Mr. Ashok Mohanty, A. G.
                                                        M/s. Satyabrata Mohanty-1 &
                                                        T.K. Kamila ( For O.P.2)

            Pvt. Ltd. and another
interest and public policy. While dealing with the public whether by giving
job or entering into contracts or licence or any form of State largesse, the
State or its instrumentality should not adopt a decision making process to
arrive at a decision which will frustrate the beneficial schemes and
enactments floated/made by the State.
21\. Therefore, whenever the State or its instrumentality goes for execution
of any contract on turnkey basis they must see that a stipulation may be
incorporated in the tender and contract asking the successful bidder to
purchase materials necessary for execution of work contract from local rate
contract holders having ISI mark so that the interest of SSI Units and M.S.
enterprises is protected.
22\. With the aforesaid observation, the writ petitions are dismissed. No
order as to cost.

2\. Mr. R.K. Rath, learned Senior Advocate and Mr. S.P. Mishra, learned Senior
Advocate appearing for the petitioners in both the cases challenge the action
of opposite party no.2 and opposite party nos.6 to 11 on the ground that the
Tender Call Notice in Annexure-1 has been issued in clear violation of
statutory provisions and with mala fide intention and without jurisdiction
overriding the principles contained in the Industrial Policy Resolution,2007 (
for short, 'IPR, 2007') of Government of Orissa and Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprise Development Policy, 2009 (in short, 'MSME' Policy, 2009') for the
purchase of EPM Rate Contract items i.e. ISI Mark UPVC casing Pipes, as per
IS: 12818/92. The petitioners are Small Scale Industrial Units duly registered
under the Director of Industries, Opposite party no.5 and are also registered
with the Director of Export Promotion and Marketing, opposite party no.3( for
short, 'EPM') and Bureau of Indian Standards for manufacturing of PVC pipes
and fittings of different diameters. Petitioner nos.1 & 3 are manufacturing
PVC pipes and fittings from 15 mm to 250 mm diameters and usually from 15 mm
to 150 mm diameter pipes are used for general purpose including the household
purpose, but from  3 160 mm to 250 mm diameter pipes are mainly and
exclusively required for Lift Irrigation Projects by the OLIC. After
announcement by the Ministry of Fertiliser and Chemical of Govt. of India
declaring Balasore District as a priority sector for Petrochemical i.e.
Polymer based Industrial Cluster, all industries in this cluster have gone for
modernization and technology up-gradation by investing substantial amount
availing financial assistance from commercial banks. While considering
financing to these Units, the Bank had taken into account purchases of PVC
pipes by the OLIC thereby ensuring service of term loan with interest.
3\. Mr. Rath submitted that the preamble of the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act, 2006 provides for facilitating the promotion and
development and enhancing the competitiveness of micro, small and medium
enterprises and for matters connected therewith. Section 11 of the said Act
provides for procurement preference policy. Section 30 of the Act empowers the
State Government to make rules and pursuant to such the Government of Orissa
in Industry Department came up with MSME Development Policy, 2009 which was
approved by the State Cabinet in their 44th Meeting held on 1st February, 2009
and was published in the Official Gazette vide Notification No.351 dated
9.3.2009. Such MSME Development Policy, 2009 provides that the government
shall endeavour to promote marketing of goods and services produced/provided
by MSMEs. Paragraph 7.2 of such Policy provides  4 that the State Government
will ensure that requirements of goods and services by Government Department
and agencies under its control are procured from MSMEs.
4\. The State Government in Finance Department has already amended Appendix 6
of the Orissa General Financial Rules of Vol.II before Rule-1 inserting
therein that in respect of items of stores for which Rate Contract has been
entered into by the Director of Export Promotion and Marketing, purchase of
such items by all Departments of government, quasi-government Agency and State
owned Corporations should be only from sources with whom such Rate Contract
has been entered into by placing order in accordance with para 17 of the
procedure outlined in Government of Orissa, Industries Department Office
Memorandum dated 27th February, 1973. The Rate Contract system was introduced
at the behest of OLIC and RWSS Department, Government of Orissa and the said
system of rate contract for PVC pipes for SSI is in force since last twenty
five years. The rate contract is now in the domain of opposite party no.3. The
rate contract system in respect of specific store items not in the exclusive
list and manufactured by the local small scale industrial units were finalised
by the DEPM. This was done on the basis of competitive offers received from
local units, cost structure obtained from these offers, market price of
similar items and other consideration relevant to fixing the price of the
product. Periodic  5 extensions were granted by the DEPM extending the
validity of rate contract with these local MSMEs.
5\. Mr. Rath submitted that in spite of the decision of the Government to
support the manufactures of PVC pipes having rate contract, the Board of
Directors in their 156 th meeting resolved to implement the "Turnkey" system
in execution of Lift Irrigation Projects sanctioned by different funding
agencies in order to abolish the store system. In view of such resolution, the
SSI Units are deprived of supplying the casing pipes and strainer. The M.D.,
OLIC-opposite party no.2 by adopting indirect method in violation to IPR MSME
policy and OGFR Rules as laid down by the Government is trying to procure the
same from outside manufacturers through open tender. Manufacturing capacity of
all the rate contract holders taken together is adequate enough to meet the
annual requirements. As per para 20.31 of the IPR, 1996, the State Government
Departments and agencies under the control of the State Govt. will purchase
E.P. & M. rate contract items from the rate contract holders small scale
Industries at the price fixed in the rate contract without inviting tender.
The Chief Secretary of the State by his letter No.VII EMM- 14/93-17(225)/I
(EPM) dated 5.7.1993 addressed to all the Departments of Govt./All Heads of
the Departments/all State owned Corporations/all Collectors directed that they
should procure their store items from the rate contract holders at the price
fixed in the rate contract and they should not go for inviting tenders. The
said letter  6 also reveals that the OGFR (Rule 1 in Appendix -6, Vol. II)
also provides for such procedure. The Director of Industries, Orissa- opposite
party no.5 wrote letter No. IP-V-20/2011, 9913 dated 25.7.2011 addressed to
the Managing Director, OLIC -opposite party no.2 regarding purchase of PVC
pipes from SSI Units as the entrepreneur has apprehended that the contractor
may purchase the required PVC pipes from any manufacturer outside Orissa in
this type of tender. By the Tender Call Notice the petitioners are indirectly
debarred from participating in open tender issued by the MD, OLIC, opp. party
no.2 because the petitioners being EPM rate contract holding units and having
already given their offer for casing pipes to the Director EPM-opp. party
no.3, the petitioners cannot participate in the tender having once submitted
the offer for finalisation of the rate contract and as such in an indirect and
clandestine way opp. party no.2 is trying to debar the petitioner from
participating in open tender.
6\. Prior to issuance of Tender Call Notice in Annexure-1, the Executive
Engineers of OLIC, Sambalpur, Jajpur Road and Baripada floated tenders for
execution of L.I. Projects on turnkey basis to the general contractors on
7.2.2010, 1.2.2010, and 14.1.2010 respectively which was challenged by the
Orissa PVC Pipe Manufacturers' Association by filing a writ petition in
W.P.(C) No. 3869 of 2010 disposed of on 29.10.2010 and while disposing of the
aforementioned writ application, this Court held that procurement of goods by
opposite party no.3 on the basis of the resolution passed  7 under Annexure-3
cannot be termed as illegal and therefore, the petitioner cannot ask for
quashing of Annexures-3, 4 & 5 and accordingly, dismissed the writ petition.
But in the similar circumstances, when the Director of Health Services, State
Drug Unit, Orissa called for tender vide letter No.11106 dated 28.10.2009 in
contravention of the policy decision of the State Government i.e. Industrial
Policy Resolution, 2007 and MSME Development Policy, 2009, the same was
challenged by the Utkal Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association in W.P.(C)
No.18494 of 2009 which was disposed of on 3.3.2011 quashing the tender call
notice under Annexure-7, so far as it relates to 31 items of drugs and medical
consumables and those items which were excluded from tender call notice for
being procured from the local SSI units/MSMEs under the rate contract system.
7\. Mr. Rath further submitted that the decision making process adopted by
opp. party no.2 in issuing the tender call notice vide Annexure-1 is fraught
with procedural infirmities as the same cannot override a policy decision of
the Government, which has the sanction and approval of the State Cabinet in
their 44th Meeting held on the 1st February, 2009. The decision to issue the
tender call notice vide Annexure-1 has been taken at the behest of the opp.
party no.2, whereas the MSME Development Policy, 2009 has been formulated
through an elaborate consultative process involving all stake-holders
including Industries Associations, Financial Institutions, Experts and  8
Government Departments concerned. Opposite party No.2 being an instrumentality
of the State and a delegate cannot ride roughshod over the decision of the
Govt. of Orissa. IPR has been formulated with approval of the State Cabinet
and is the declared policy of the State Govt. Therefore, any departure of the
same in the public interest can only be made by the State Cabinet or any
authority so authorised by the State Cabinet. The rate contract for PVC pipes
for SSI Units was introduced at the behest of the Water Resources Department,
Govt. of Orissa and has been in force since the last 25 years and there has
been no complaint or adverse report by the Water Resources Department, Govt.
of Orissa. As per EPM Policy of the Government of India, the MSMEs have
obtained ISO and ISI Certification. In the back drop of these facts, the
decision-making procedure adopted by opp. party no.2 in excluding the PVC
pipes being supplied by the MSMEs on rate contract into the list of items of
the tender call notice under Annexure-1 smacks of mala fide. The use of the
words "Any other means" in clause 7.2(b)(ii) of MSME Development Policy, 2009
clearly precludes purchase of rate contract item in the guise of
comprehensive/turnkey tender. The tender notice vide Annexure-1 imposes a
tender cost fee of Rs.10,000/- plus VAT @4% (non- refundable) which is in
contravention of the Orissa MSME Development Policy, 2009.
8\. Mr. Mishra, learned Senior Advocate placing reliance upon the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shivdeo Singh and  9 others v. State of Punjab and
others decided on 8th February, 1961 submitted that the petitioner, who was
not a party in the previous writ petition can maintain the present writ
petition.
9\. Mr. Ashok Mohanty, learned Advocate General submitted the tender call
notice under Annexure-1 has not been floated for procurement of PVC pipes
directly. The said tender is for installation of Bore wells with VES & Yield
Test under "BKVY-Deep Bore Well Secha Karyakrama". According to the learned
Advocate General, since the tender is not for procurement of PVC pipes, all
the arguments advanced by the petitioners referring to different IPRs
including IPR , 2007 and Orissa MSMEs Development Policy, 2009 are not
applicable. The IPR, 2007 and MSMEs Development Policy, 2009 provide for
procurement of PVC pipes from the EPM rate contract holders. Therefore, the
prayer made in the writ petition is misconceived. Learned Advocate General
referring to Office Memo dated 11.12.1995 of the Government of Orissa in
Finance Department submitted that C.& A.G. reports contain data relating to
misappropriation defalcation, theft, pilferage and large scale
irregularisations of store materials, purchased by Engineering Departments
which possibly result in huge loss of Government money. Due to prolonged
storage of some materials, these at times have to be disposed of. Sometimes it
is noticed that the inventory level in the stores in a Department does not
commensurate with the budget provision. Thus public funds are being blocked in
many cases. With a view to avoid these situations,  10 Government have been
pleased to decide that with effect from 1.4.1996, there will be no purchase of
departmental store materials nor booking of materials to show utilisation of
budget provision. It will be the responsibility of the contractor to purchase
stores and utilise them in the work. Therefore, the future agreements with the
contractors should be executed accordingly and necessary modifications to the
agreement form would be made.
10\. Placing reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Fida
Hussain & others v. Mordabad Development Authority and another, AIR 2011 SC
3001 learned Advocate General submitted that a decision of this Court is
binding when the same question is raised again before this Court and
reconsideration cannot be pleaded on the ground that relevant provisions etc.
were not considered by the Court in the former case.
Further, placing reliance upon the decision of Sow Chandra Kante v. Sk.Habib,
(1975) 1 SCC 674 submitted that a review of a judgment is a serious step and
reluctant resort to it is proper except where a glaring omission or patent
mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility. A
mere repetition, through different counsel, of old and overruled arguments, a
second trip over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of
inconsequential import are obviously insufficient. The very strict need for
compliance with these factors is the rationale behind the insistence of
counsel's certificate which should not be a routine affair or a habitual step.
11
11\. On the rival contentions of the parties, the questions that arise for
consideration of this Court are as follows:
> (i) Whether the tender floated under Annexure-1 is a tender for execution of
> works contract on turnkey basis or a contract for procurement of PVC pipes?
> (ii) If the answer to question no.(i) is that tender under Annexure-1 is for
> execution of work on turnkey basis and not for procurement of PVC pipes,
> then whether the relief sought for in the writ petitions can be granted to
> the petitioners ?
> (iii) Once a decision attained finality in favour of a party/litigant
> whether the Court while hearing the writ petition of other nature can issue
> any direction which can have effect of taking away the impact of final
> decision in earlier case ?
12\. Since question Nos. (i) & (ii) are interlinked, they are dealt with
together. So far question no.(i) is concerned, perusal of tender call notice
dated 30.6.2011 floated under Annexure-1 clearly reveals that it is a tender
for installation of bore wells with VES & yield test under "BKVY-Deep Bore
Well Secha Karyakrama". The said tender is a contract work. The contractors of
such categories have registered themselves with State Government/contractors
of equivalent grade/ registered with Central Government/MES/Railways for
execution of civil works and reputed agency/firms and companies who have to
procure definite proof from the appropriate authority. The bidders having
relevant experience with reference to work are eligible to submit fees in
respect of works mentioned in the tender papers. Thus,  12 it clearly reveals
that the tender is floated for execution of work on turnkey basis. It is not a
tender for procurement of PVC pipes from any manufacturer or supplier.
Therefore, various IPRs including IPR, 2007 and the Orissa MSME Development
Policy, 2009 have no application so far the work intended to be executed on
turnkey basis under Annexure-1 is concerned. Thus, the relief sought for in
both the writ petitions cannot be granted to the petitioners.
13\. So far question No.(iii) is concerned, since in a similar writ petition
being W.P.(C) No.3869 of 2010 (Orissa PVC Pipes Manufacturers' Association v.
State of Orissa and others) this Court dismissed the said writ petition on
29.10.2010 with reference to clause (7) of the MSME Development Policy, 2009,
in the present writ petition this Court cannot take a contrary decision
nullifying its earlier decision.
14\. Apart from above, the earlier judgment of this Court dated 29.10.2010
passed in W.P.(C) No.3869 of 2010 was not brought to the notice of this Court
while this Court disposed of the W.P.(C) No.18494 of 2009 on 3.3.2011 in Utkal
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association's case. Moreover, in Utkal
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association's case tender was floated for supply
of drugs and medical samples directly from the suppliers. But in the instant
case tender was not floated for direct purchase of PVC pipes. In the present
case, tender under Annexure-1 is floated for execution of work on turnkey
basis. There is no tender for purchase of PVC  13 pipes. Therefore, the
decision of this Court in Utkal Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association's
case is also not applicable and is of no help to the petitioners in the
instant case.
15\. The Allahabad High Court in the case of Rustom Khusro Sapurji Gandhi v.
Amrit Abhijat and others, AIR 2007 Allahabad 149 (FB) held as under :
> " ..... We have no doubt that legally once a decision has attained finality
> in favour of a party/litigant, no other co-ordinate Bench while hearing a
> Public Interest Litigation or a writ petition of other nature can issue any
> directions, which could have the effect of taking away the impact of the
> final decision without impleading the affected party, who has obtained the
> decision which has attained finality, or even after impleading such party.
> The reason is that a co-ordinate Bench cannot sit in appeal and pass a
> judgment or issue a direction taking away the impact of a decision, which
> has attained finality, as that would virtually mean a coordinate Bench
> sitting in appeal over the final decision of another Bench of the same
> strength."
16\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khoday Distilleries Ltd. and
another v. Registrar General, Supreme Court of India; (1996) 3 SCC 114 held
that in a case where substance of the challenge is to the correctness of the
decision on merits after it has become final, there could be no question of
invoking Art. 32 of the Constitution to claim reconsideration of the decision
on the basis of its effect in accordance with law.
17\. Therefore, in view of the above judicial pronouncement and otherwise also
the writ petitions are not maintainable.  14
18\. Before parting with the case, we feel it appropriate to observe that
undisputedly the petitioners are manufacturers of PVC pipes and fittings for
different diameters. P.V.C. pipes from 15 mm diameters to 150 mm diameters are
meant for general use including the household purpose. But PVC pipes from 160
mm to 250 diameters are mainly and exclusively required for Lift Irrigation
Project by the Orissa Lift Irrigation Corporation Ltd.-Opp. Party No.2.
Undisputedly, various Industrial Policies are floated by the Government to
support small scale industries and under the MSMED Act protection is also
given to micro small and medium enterprises. The MSMED Act was enacted with an
intention for facilitating the promotion, development and enhancing the
competitiveness of MSM Enterprises. Section 11 of the MSMED Act is as follows:
> "Procurement Preference Policy:- For facilitating promotion and development
> of Micro and Small enterprises, the Central Government or the State Govt.
> may, by order notify from time to time, preference policies in respect of
> procurement of goods and services, produced and provided by Micro and small
> enterprises by its Ministries or Departments, as the case may be, or its
> aided institutions and public sector enterprises."
19\. In the instant case, since tender under Annexure-1 is floated for
execution of the work on turnkey basis, the decision is left to the contractor
to procure PVC pipes from any manufacturer, supplier and not necessarily from
the petitioners who are EPM rate contract holders. At this juncture, it is
necessary to refer to the letter dated 16.8.2011 addressed to the Director,
E&PM, Principal Secretary  15 to Government in Water Resources Department for
favour of kind information which reads as follows :
> "1. Please find enclosed copy of letters received from Director of
> Industries, Orissa, Director, E&PM, Orissa, PVC Pipe Manufacturers'
> Association and Ganapati Pipes and Industries Pvt. Ltd.
> 2\. This is regarding tender call notice issued by Orissa Lift Irrigation
> Corporation Ltd., for PVC Casing Pipes on turnkey basis.
> 3\. Under this process there is no scope for the successful bidder to buy
> the PVC pipes from local MSMEs. The tender condition does not stipulate any
> such clause.
> 4\. It is understood that almost 70% of the tender value is of the PVC
> pipes, confirming to IS standards which is a rate contract item. As per the
> IPR, the State Government Departments and the Agencies under the control of
> State Government shall purchase the rate contract items from the rate
> contract holding Small Scale Industries (SSI) at the rate contract price
> without inviting tenders.
> 5\. Under these circumstances, you may kindly issue appropriate instructions
> to Orissa Lift Irrigation Corporation to cancel the tender and advise them
> to place order on the rate contract firms of Orissa. As an alternative a
> stipulation may be incorporated in the tender asking the successful bidder
> to purchase pipes from local rate contract holders.
> Grateful for early action.

20\. Needless to say that State and its instrumentalities should not exercise
or resort to unfettered, and uncontrolled discretion at the cost of the public
interest and public policy. While dealing with the public whether by giving
job or entering into contracts or licence or any form of State largesse, the
State or its instrumentality should not adopt a decision making process to
arrive at a decision which will frustrate the beneficial schemes and
enactments floated/made by the State.
21\. Therefore, whenever the State or its instrumentality goes for execution
of any contract on turnkey basis they must see that a stipulation may be
incorporated in the tender and contract asking the successful bidder to
purchase materials necessary for execution of work contract from local rate
contract holders having ISI mark so that the interest of SSI Units and M.S.
enterprises is protected.
22\. With the aforesaid observation, the writ petitions are dismissed. No
order as to cost.

2\. Mr. R.K. Rath, learned Senior Advocate and Mr. S.P. Mishra, learned Senior
Advocate appearing for the petitioners in both the cases challenge the action
interest and public policy. While dealing with the public whether by giving
job or entering into contracts or licence or any form of State largesse, the
State or its instrumentality should not adopt a decision making process to
arrive at a decision which will frustrate the beneficial schemes and
enactments floated/made by the State.
21\. Therefore, whenever the State or its instrumentality goes for execution
of any contract on turnkey basis they must see that a stipulation may be
incorporated in the tender and contract asking the successful bidder to
purchase materials necessary for execution of work contract from local rate
contract holders having ISI mark so that the interest of SSI Units and M.S.
enterprises is protected.
22\. With the aforesaid observation, the writ petitions are dismissed. No
order as to cost.
