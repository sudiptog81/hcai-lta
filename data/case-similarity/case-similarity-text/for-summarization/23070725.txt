    BOARD OF CONTROL FOR CRICKET IN
    INDIA & ANOTHER                                          ...     Appellants
                                               Versus
    PRASAR BHARATI BROADCASTING
    CORPORATION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER ...                             Respondents
                                               WITH
    WP(C) No.8458/2007
    BOARD OF CONTROL FOR CRICKET
    IN INDIA AND ANOTHER                                     ...     Petitioners
                                               versus
    PRASAR BHARATI, BROADCASTING CORPORATION
    OF INDIA AND ANOTHER             ... Respondents
                                               AND
59\. As a result of the foregoing discussion, the interplay between the
provisions of Section 3 of the Sports Act and Section 8 of the CTN Act have to
be read in such a manner that the shared live broadcasting signal, which
Prasar Bharati receives from ESPN / STAR, should not be placed in the channels
of Doordarshan which are to be compulsorily carried by the cable operators
under Section 8 of the CTN Act. We do not agree with the view taken by the
learned single Judge in PW(C) 7655/2007, which forms the subject matter of LPA
No.1327/2007, that carrying sports in a designated Doordarshan channel is a
matter of policy. In our view, it is a matter of administration. But, even if
we regard it as a matter of policy, such policy cannot override the statutory
provisions contained in Section 3 of the Sports Act in the manner which we
have interpreted. The appeal as well as WP(C) 8458/2007 are allowed to the
extent that the live broadcasting signal shared by ESPN / STAR by virtue of
Section 3 of the Sports Act with Prasar LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 &
9610/07 Page 51 of 52 Bharati, shall not be carried in the designated
Doordarshan channels under the must carry obligation cast by Section 8 of the
                                               AND
    WP(C) 9610/2007

BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J.
1\. This group of matters comprises of one appeal (LPA No.1327/2007) and two
writ petitions [WP(C) 8458/2007 and WP(C) 9610/2007]. As common issues arise,
these matters are being disposed of by this common judgment.
2\. LPA 1327/2007 is an appeal preferred by the Board of Control for Cricket
in India (BCCI) and Nimbus Communications Limited. During the pendency of the
appeal, appellant Numbers 3 and 4 were also added being ESPN Software India
Pvt. Ltd and Star India Pvt. Ltd. Star India Pvt. Ltd, on the termination of
the agreement by the BCCI and Nimbus, entered into a LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 2 of 52 Media Rights Agreement with BCCI with effect
from April 2012 which would continue upto 31.03.2018. ESPN Software India Pvt.
Ltd is responsible for the distribution of the sports channels, including
ESPN, STAR Sports, STAR Cricket, STAR Sports 2, STAR Cricket HD and ESPN HD.
Because of the events taking place during the pendency of the appeal, ESPN
Software India Pvt. Ltd and Star India Pvt. Ltd have been added as appellant
Nos. 3 & 4\.
3\. The said appeal (LPA No.1327/2007) is directed against a learned single
Judge‟s judgment dated 05.11.2007 in WP(C) 7655/2007. The writ petition had
been filed by the appellant Nos. 1 and 2, namely, BCCI and Nimbus. By virtue
of the impugned judgment dated 05.11.2007, the said writ petition was
dismissed. In that writ petition, BCCI and Nimbus had sought a direction to be
issued to respondent Nos. 1 & 2 (Prasar Bharati Broadcasting Corporation and
Union of India) to encrypt Doordarshan‟s Satellite Transportation Feed of live
broadcasting signals of cricket matches organized by BCCI to the Doordarshan
Kendras and transmission towers throughout India for subsequent broadcasts on
Doordarshan‟s terrestrial networks. A declaratory writ was also sought for
declaring that no person other than Prasar Bharati had the right to transmit,
relay or offer for exhibition, the live broadcasting signals of sports events
shown by Prasar Bharati under the Sports Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory
Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Act, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as „the Sports
Act‟). A declaration was also sought that no cable television network, Direct-
to- Home (DTH) Network, multi-system network or local cable operator could LPA
1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 3 of 52 broadcast such sports events
without a licence from the content owners. Finally, a direction was also
sought against the respondent No.1 for notifying that the Doordarshan signals
relayed live in respect of the sports event, including cricket matches
notified under the Sports Act, should be carried on cable television networks,
DTH Broadcasting networks, Multi- System Cable Networks, etc. pursuant to
Section 8 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995 (hereinafter
referred to as „the CTN Act‟).
4\. The learned single Judge, by virtue of the judgment dated 05.11.2007,
rejected each of the prayers and, as aforesaid, dismissed the said WP(C)
7655/2007. The learned single Judge analysed the various provisions of the
Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 (hereinafter
referred to as „the Prasar Bharati Act‟), the CTN Act, the Sports Act and the
Guidelines for Downlinking of TV Channels issued on 11.11.2005 as also the
Guidelines for Uplinking from India issued on 02.12.2005 and concluded that
Parliament had consciously chosen not to prescribe encryption for transmission
of the feed received by Doordarshan to its Kendras. The learned single Judge,
with regard to the notification issued under Section 8 of the CTN Act, held
that carrying of sporting events in the designated Doordarshan Channels was a
matter of policy with which the court could not interfere. He, however,
observed that if non-encryption resulted in the violation of any copyrights,
which the appellants held as content owners, they were free to seek redressal.
The learned single Judge, however, refrained from giving any opinion as to
whether the non- encryption of Doordarshan‟s Satellite Transportation Feed of
Live LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 4 of 52 Broadcasting
Signals of cricket matches to Doordarshan Kendras and transmission towers for
subsequent broadcasting on Doordarshan‟s terrestrial networks, resulted in any
violation of the copyrights of the appellants. In view of the above, as
mentioned earlier, the learned single Judge dismissed the said writ petition.
5\. Aggrieved by the said order and / or judgment, the appellants BCCI and
Nimbus filed the said LPA (1327/2007). As pointed out above, subsequently,
because of the intervening events, ESPN Software India Pvt. Limited and Star
India Pvt. Ltd have been added as appellants 3 and 4.
6\. WP(C) 8458/2007 was initially filed by BCCI and Nimbus. Subsequently, as
in the case of LPA No.1327/2007, ESPN Software India Pvt. Ltd and Star India
Pvt. Ltd have been added as petitioner numbers 3 and
4\. In WP(C) 8458/2007, the petitioners referred to above, have sought the
striking down of Section 3 of the Sports Act insofar as it relates to cricket
test matches. There is also a prayer for striking down the notification dated
13.09.2000 issued by Prasar Bharati Broadcasting Corporation (Respondent No.1)
(hereinafter referred to as „Prasar Bharati‟) under the CTN Act, inter alia,
mandating that DD1 (National Channel) and DD (News Channel) be carried
compulsorily by cable operators. The striking down of the order dated
29.05.2007 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting was also sought. By virtue of the said order, LPA 1327/07 & WPC
Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 5 of 52 clause 7.9 was added to the Schedule to
the Licence Agreement for DTH services. Clause 7.9 was to read as under:-
> "The licencee shall carry or include in his DTH services the TV Channels
> which have been notified for mandatory and compulsory carriage as per the
> provisions of Section 8 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act,
> 1995 as amended, failing which the licensor shall be at liberty to take
> action as per clause 20.1 of this agreement."
7\. In WP(C) 8458/2007, it was further prayed that Notification dated
03.07.2007 issued by the Central Government and the Notification dated
19.10.2007 issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting be struck
down. By virtue of the notification dated 03.10.2007, the Central Government,
in purported exercise of the powers conferred under Section 2(1)(s) of the
Sports Act, notified the following sporting events in respect of cricket to be
of national importance:-
> (1) All official one-day and Twenty-20 matches played by the Indian Men‟s
> cricket team and such test matches as are considered to be of high public
> interest by the Central Government;
> (2) Semi-finals and Finals of Men‟s World Cup and International Cricket
> Council Championship Trophies;
8\. The notification dated 19.10.2007 issued by the Ministry of Information
and Broadcasting once again invoked the powers under Section 2(1)(s) of the
Sports Act, thereby notifying the India-Pak Test series of LPA 1327/07 & WPC
Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 6 of 52 cricket to be played in November-December
2007 as a sporting event of national importance. The other prayers in the said
WP(C) 8458/2007 related to interim orders.
9\. WP(C) 9610/2007 has been filed by one Ravi Dev Gupta claiming to be the
President of Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat, a body registered under the
Societies Registration Act, 1860. It is said that the said body raises various
issues relating to consumers. The writ petition is in the nature of a Public
Interest Litigation (PIL). In WP(C) 9610/2007, a declaration has been sought
that a portion of the notification dated 03.10.2007, to which we have referred
to above, is ultra vires the Sports Act and also Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. According to the petitioner, the offending portion of
the said notification is - "such test matches as are considered to be of high
public interest by the Central Government". A prayer has also been made for
commanding the respondents (Union of India and Prasar Bharati) to live
telecast the feed from the content holders of all test matches being played by
the Indian Men‟s Cricket Team with any other test match playing country
recognized by ICC. A further prayer has also been made to direct the live
telecast of test matches being played between India and Australia with effect
from 26.12.2007. In essence, this writ petition seeks that all test matches
being played by the Indian Men‟s Cricket Team with any other test match
playing country should be mandatorily telecast live from the feed provided by
the content holder. The petitioner has even challenged the discretion of the
Central Government to specify as to which test matches are to be considered of
high public interest. We may add that, initially, WP(C) LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 7 of 52 9610/2007 was filed against only two
respondents - Union of India and Prasar Bharati. However, subsequently, BCCI
and Taj Television Limited were also added as respondents.
10\. Before we set out the rival contentions of the parties, it would be
appropriate to refer to the provisions of the various Acts and Rules. The
Prasar Bharati Act came into operation on 15.09.1997. And, by virtue of
Section 3 thereof, Prasar Bharati was established as a corporation. Its
functions and powers were spelt out in Section 12 thereof. Section 12(1)
provides that "subject to the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act, it shall
be the primary duty of Prasar Bharati to organize and conduct 'public
broadcasting services' to inform, educate and entertain the public and to
ensure a balanced development of broadcasting on radio and television".
Section 12(2)(e) clearly stipulated that "Prasar Bharati shall, inter alia, be
guided by the objective of providing adequate coverage to sports and games so
as to encourage healthy competition and the spirit of sportsmanship". Section
12(3) stipulates the steps which Prasar Bharati may take for realizing the
objectives spelt out in Section 12(2). Section 12(3)(a) enables Prasar Bharati
to take steps to ensure that broadcasting is conducted as a public service to
provide and produce programmes. Section 12(3)(c) enables Prasar Bharati to
negotiate for purchase of or, otherwise acquire programmes and rights or
privileges in respect of respondents and other events, films, serials,
occasions, meetings, functions or incidents of public interest for
broadcasting and to establish procedures for the allocation of such
programmes, rights or privileges to the services.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 8 of 52
11\. From these provisions, it is clear that Prasar Bharati has the primary
duty to organise and conduct public broadcasting service with the object of
informing, educating and entertaining the public and to ensure a balanced
development of broadcasting on radio and television. One of its objectives is
to provide adequate coverage on sports and games so as to encourage healthy
competition and the spirit of sportsmanship. In order to realize this goal,
the Prasar Bharati has been empowered to negotiate for purchase, or otherwise
acquire programmes and rights or privileges, inter alia, in respect of sports.
12\. The next set of provisions relates to the CTN Act. The preamble to the
CTN Act indicates that it is an Act "to regulate the operation of cable
television networks in the country and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto". Section 3 of the CTN Act stipulates that no person shall
operate a cable television network unless he is registered as a cable operator
under the Act. The expression "cable operator" has been defined in Section
2(aiii) as follows:-
> "2. Definitions."- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires -
> xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (aiii) "cable operator" means any person who
> provides cable service through a cable television network or otherwise
> controls or is responsible for the management and operation of a cable LPA
> 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 9 of 52 television network and
> fulfils the prescribed eligibility criteria and conditions."
The above definition was introduced with retrospective effect from 25.10.2011
and earlier the expression "cable operator" was defined under Section 2(aa).
However, the said amendment is not a matter of much concern insofar as the
present group of cases is concerned.
13\. The most important and material provision of the CTN Act, insofar as we
are concerned, is Section 8 thereof. This has also undergone an amendment by
virtue of Act 21 of 2011 with retrospective effect from 25.10.2011. Though the
amendment has been brought about after the decision of the learned single
Judge in WP(C) 7655/2007, it will not alter the position insofar as the cases
before us are concerned. We are, therefore, referring to the provisions of
Section 8 of the CTN Act as they stand today. Section 8 reads as under:-
> "8. Compulsory transmission of certain channels.- (1) The Central Government
> may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify the names of
> Doordarshan channels or the channels operated by or on behalf of Parliament,
> to be mandatorily carried by the cable operators in their cable service and
> the manner of reception and re-transmission of such channels.
> Provided that in areas where digital addressable system has not been
> introduced in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section
> 4A, the notification as regards the prime band is concerned shall be limited
> to the carriage of two Doordarshan terrestrial channels and one regional
> language LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 10 of 52 channel of
> the State in which the network of the cable operator is located.
> (2) The channels referred to in sub-section (1) shall be re- transmitted
> without any deletion or alteration of any programme transmitted on such
> channels.
> (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-section (1), any notification
> issued by the Central Government or the Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting
> Corporation of India) in pursuance of the provisions of sub-section (1),
> prior to the 25th day of October, 2011 shall continue to remain in force
> till such notifications are rescinded or amended, as the case may be."
14\. A plain reading of Section 8(1) makes it clear that the Central
Government is empowered to specify the names of Doordarshan channels or the
channels operated by or on behalf of the Parliament, by a notification in the
Official Gazette, to be mandatorily carried by the cable operators in their
cable service and also specify the manner of reception and retransmission of
such channels. The proviso makes it clear that where the digital addressable
systems have not been introduced in place of the earlier addressable systems,
the notification with regard to the prime band would be limited to the
carriage of two Doordarshan Terrestrial Channels and one regional language
channel of the State in which the network of the cable operator is located. It
is also made clear by virtue of Section 8(3) that notwithstanding the
provisions of sub-Section (1), any notification issued by the Central
Government or Prasar Bharati in pursuance of the provisions of sub-Section (1)
prior to 25.10.2011 (the date from which the amendment took effect), shall
continue to remain in force till such notifications are rescinded or amended,
as the case may be. All that Section 8 does is to permit the LPA 1327/07 & WPC
Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 11 of 52 Central Government to specify the
Doordarshan channels or the channels operated by or on behalf of the
Parliament to be mandatorily carried by the cable operators. The earlier
notifications issued under Section 8, including the notification dated
13.09.2000 to which we have alluded above, required the carrying of DD1
(National Channel) and DD (News Channel) and one regional language channel by
the cable operators.
15\. The next set of provisions, which need our attention, is to be found in
the Sports Act. The preamble to the Sports Act indicates that it is an Act "to
provide access to the largest number of listeners and viewers, on a free to
air basis of sporting events of national importance through mandatory sharing
of sports broadcasting signals with Prasar Bharati and for matters connected
therewith or incidental thereto. Section 3 of the Sports Act is the most
important Section for our purposes and it reads as under:-
> "3. Mandatory sharing of certain sports signals. - (l) No content rights
> owner or holder and no television or radio broadcasting service provider
> shall carry a live television broadcast on any cable or Direct-to-Home
> network or radio commentary broadcast in India of sporting events of
> national importance, unless it simultaneously shares the live broadcasting
> signal, without its advertisements, with the Prasar Bharati to enable them
> to re-transmit the same on its terrestrial networks and Direct-to-Home
> networks in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be
> specified.
> (2) The terms and conditions under sub-section (1) shall also provide that
> the advertisement revenue sharing between the content rights owner or holder
> and the Prasar Bharati shall be in the ratio of not less than 75:25 in case
> of television coverage and 50:50 in case of radio coverage.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 12 of 52
> (3) The Central Government may specify a percentage of the revenue received
> by the Prasar Bharati under sub-section (2), which shall be utilised by the
> Prasar Bharati for broadcasting other sporting events."
16\. We note that Section 3 uses several expressions, such as "cable network",
"Direct-to-Home network," "sporting events of national importance" and
"terrestrial networks". In order to understand these expressions, it would be
necessary to see the definitions of "Direct-to-Home (DTH) Broadcasting
Service", "sporting events of national importance" and "terrestrial television
service" as provided in Section 2(1)(j), (s) and (t) which are set out
hereinbelow:-
> "2. Definitions.- (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-
> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
> (j) "Direct-to-Home (DTH) broadcasting service" means a service for multi-
> channel distribution of programmes direct to a subscriber‟s premises without
> passing through an intermediary such as a cable operator by up linking to a
> satellite system;
> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
> (s) "sporting events of national importance" means such national or
> international sporting events; held in India or abroad, as may be notified
> by the Central Government in the Official Gazette to be of national
> importance;
> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page
> 13 of 52
> (t) "terrestrial television service" means a television broadcasting service
> provided over the air by using a land-based transmitter and directly
> received through receiver sets by the public."
17\. We may also refer to Section 5 of the Sports Act which reads as under:-
> "5. Power of the Central Government to issue Guidelines.- The Central
> Government shall take all such measures, as it deems fit or expedient, by
> way of issuing Guidelines for mandatory sharing of broadcasting signals with
> Prasar Bharati relating to sporting events of national importance:
> Provided that the Guidelines issued before the promulgation of the Sports
> Broadcasting Signals (Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Ordinance, 2007
> (Ord. 4 of 2007), shall be deemed to have been issued validly under the
> provisions of this section."
18\. A reference also needs to be made to the Sports Broadcasting Signals
(Mandatory Sharing with Prasar Bharati) Rules 2007 (hereinafter referred to as
„the Sports Rules‟) and, in particular to Rule 3(7) which reads as under:-
> "3. Sharing of Sports Broadcasting Signals with Prasar Bharati.-
> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx (7) The Prasar Bharati shall have the right to
> retransmit the signals on its terrestrial and Direct-to-Home networks
> including the AM and FM Channels of the All India Radio."
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 14 of 52
19\. From the above provisions of the Sports Act and Sports Rules, it appears
that no content rights owner or holder and no television broadcasting service
provider can carry a live television broadcast on any cable or DTH network or
radio commentary broadcast in India of sporting events of national importance
unless it simultaneously shares the live broadcasting signal, without its
advertisements, with Prasar Bharati "to enable them to re-transmit the same on
its terrestrial networks and DTH networks" in such manner and on such terms
and conditions as may be specified. It is also pertinent to note that Section
3(2) indicates that the terms and conditions referred to in Section 3(1) shall
also provide that the advertisement revenue sharing between the content rights
owner or holder and the Prasar Bharati would be in the ratio of not less than
75:25 in the case of television coverage. This means that if the shared
content is re- transmitted by Prasar Bharati on its terrestrial networks and
DTH network and it earns advertisement revenue from the same, such revenue
shall be shared with the content rights owner / holder and Prasar Bharati in
the ratio not less than 75:25 in the case of television coverage.
20\. Mr Sudhir Chandra, senior advocate and Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior
advocate argued on behalf of ESPN Software India Pvt. Ltd and Star India Pvt.
Limited, respectively, in these matters. Mr Amit Sibal advanced arguments on
behalf of BCCI and Mr Paras Kuhad, Additional Solicitor General of India,
appeared on behalf of Prasar Bharati and Union of India.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 15 of 52
21\. Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that the issue at hand related to the
interplay between the provisions of Section 3 of the Sports Act and Section 8
of the CTN Act. He submitted that Section 3 of the Sports Act required a
content rights owner to mandatorily share simultaneously the live broadcasting
signal of sporting events of national importance, without advertisements, with
Prasar Bharati to enable Prasar Bharati to re-transmit the same on Prasar
Bharati‟s terrestrial networks and DTH networks. He submitted that the
mandatory sharing of the live broadcasting signals was only for the purposes
of enabling Prasar Bharati to re-transmit the said signals on Prasar Bharati‟s
terrestrial networks and Prasar Bharati‟s DTH Networks and did not extend to
cable operators. This is so, because cable operators cannot be regarded as
part of Prasar Bharati‟s terrestrial networks or Prasar Bharati‟s DTH
Networks. He submitted that while the provisions of Section 3 are clearly
mandatory, the provisions of Section 8 of the CTN Act are not compulsory on
the Central Government. Referring to Section 8 of the CTN Act, Mr Sudhir
Chandra submitted that it stipulates that the Central Government "may", by
notification in the Official Gazette, specify the names of Doordarshan
channels or the channels operated by or on behalf of Parliament, to be
mandatorily carried by the cable operators in their cable service and the
manner of reception and re-transmission of such channels. He submitted that,
while it was compulsory for the cable operators to carry the specified
Doordarshan channels and channels operated by or on behalf of Parliament, it
was not compulsory on the Central Government, inasmuch as the Central
Government could choose which channels were to be mandatorily carried by the
cable operators. It was further submitted that LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07
& 9610/07 Page 16 of 52 Section 8 of the CTN Act was separate and distinct
from Section 3 of the Sports Act. There was no obligation cast under Section 8
of the CTN Act to violate Section 3 of the Sports Act. He submitted that ESPN
/ STAR do not have any objection, nor can they have, for showing the live
telecast of the cricket matches on the terrestrial networks or DTH networks of
Prasar Bharati. His objection is that the live feed cannot be shared with
private cable operators. He referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case
of State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v. Vishnu Prasad Sharma and Others: AIR
1966 SC 1593. In that decision, with reference to the Land Acquisition Act
1894, the Supreme Court observed as under:-
> " ... As the Act is an expropriatory Act, that interpretation of it should
> be accepted which puts the least burden on the expropriated owner".
22\. Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that Section 3 of the Sports Act was also an
expropriatory legislation and it should be so interpreted as to cast the least
burden on the expropriated owner, which, in the present case was the content
rights owner, namely, ESPN / STAR. A reference was also made by Mr Sudhir
Chandra to the Supreme Court decision in the case of Devinder Singh and Others
v. State of Punjab and Others: AIR 2008 SC 261, wherein once again, with
reference to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, which was an expropriatory
legislation, the Supreme Court held as under:-
"41. ... expropriatory legislation, as is well-known, must be strictly
construed. ..."
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 17 of 52
23\. It was, therefore, contended by Mr Sudhir Chandra that Section 3 of the
Sports Act should be construed strictly and in a manner which casts the least
burden on the expropriated owner. It was, therefore, submitted that the
simultaneous live broadcasting signal, which was mandatorily to be shared with
Prasar Bharati, could only be utilized by Prasar Bharati for re- transmitting
the feed on its own terrestrial networks and its own DTH networks and not
through the network of cable operators by employing the route of Section 8 of
CTN Act. Section 8 of the CTN Act, could not be read as being destructive of
Section 3 of the Sports Act.
24\. It was further submitted by Mr Sudhir Chandra that there is no doubt that
there was public interest in the sharing of the live broadcasting signal with
regard to cricket matches of national importance over the terrestrial and DTH
networks of Prasar Bharati, but this cannot be extended to cover cable
operators. Normally, cable operators would have had to take a licence from
ESPN / STAR, but because DD1 and DD (News Channel) are compulsorily required
to be shown on cable by virtue of Section 8 of the CTN Act, if the live feed
is broadcast on these channels, the cable operators would not and do not need
to take a licence from ESPN / STAR as their viewers would be able to see the
cricket matches, in any event.
25\. A reference was made to the Supreme Court decision in the case of State
of Rajasthan and Others v. Aanjaney Organic Herbal Pvt. Limited:
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 18 of 52
2012 (10) SCC 283, wherein the Supreme Court recognized the well-settled
principle that (para 12):-
"... a thing which cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly over-
reaching the statutory restriction."
26\. Dr Abhishek Singhvi submitted that Star India Pvt. Ltd was the owner of
the rights and ESPN Software India Pvt. Ltd was the broadcaster. The rights
had been purchased from BCCI in every form for a huge sum of Rs 3851 crores
for the period April 2012 to March 2018. Section 3 of the Sports Act was aimed
at people, who did not have access through the private platform, but had
access to the terrestrial and DTH network of Doordarshan. He further submitted
that, as per the TRAI Consultation Paper 5 of 2013, only 4.29% of the viewers
do not have access to cable / private platform. He submitted that the private
platform / cable operators, in any, event, charge a fee / bouquet charges and
the consumers / subscribers are not getting their television content free.
27\. Dr Singhvi further submitted that by placing the live broadcasting signal
in the two Doordarshan channels, which have to be compulsorily carried by the
cable operators under Section 8 of the CTN Act, ESPN / STAR are hit on two
counts. First of all, they lose their subscription money and, secondly, they
lose out on the advertisement revenue. The end result of this scheme is that
it benefits the cable operators at the cost of ESPN / STAR. Dr Singhvi
submitted that when there is an expropriation for LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 19 of 52 purpose „X‟, the same must be used for purpose
„X‟ only. Meaning thereby that when the expropriation by virtue of Section 3
of the Sports Act is for re- transmission of the live broadcasting signals on
Prasar Bharati‟s terrestrial networks and Prasar Bharati‟s DTH networks, then
it must be used for that purpose only and cannot be used for extending the
expropriation to cover re- transmission through cable operators. A reference
was made to the Supreme Court decision in the case of Rajasthan State Road
Transport Corporation and Others v. Zakir Hussain: 2005 (7) SCC 447, wherein
the Supreme Court held as under:-
> "33. ... it is settled law that where an Act creates an obligation and
> enforces the performance in a specified manner, the performance cannot be
> enforced in any other manner."
28\. A reference was also made to Royal Orchid Hotels Limited and Another v.
G. Jayarama Reddy and Others: 2011 (10) SCC 608 which was also a decision in
the context of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Supreme Court observed as
under :-
> "38. ... the courts have repeatedly held that in exercise of its power of
> eminent domain, the state can compulsorily acquire land of the private
> persons, but this proposition cannot be overstretched to legitimize a
> patently illegal and fraudulent exercise undertaken for depriving the land
> owners of their constitutional right to property with a view to favour
> private persons. ..."
29\. It was submitted that ESPN / STAR‟s rights had been mandatorily acquired
under Section 3 of the Sports Act for the specific purpose of re-
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 20 of 52
transmitting the same on Prasar Bharati‟s terrestrial and DTH networks. But,
it has directly resulted in benefiting cable operators at the cost of ESPN /
STAR. According to Dr Singhvi, this has resulted in a subscription loss of Rs
970 crores and a loss of advertising revenue to the extent of Rs 245 crores
since 2007.
30\. Dr Singhvi further submitted that the Sports Act was a specific Act and
compared to the CTN Act, it was a later Act. He submitted that the power under
the CTN Act could not be used in derogation of the Sports Act. He referred to
the preamble of the Sports Act which, as pointed out earlier in this judgment,
indicated that it was an Act to provide access to the largest number of
listeners and viewers, "on a free to air basis" of sporting events of national
importance through mandatory sharing of sports broadcast signals with Prasar
Bharati and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. A reference
was made to the Lok Sabha debates and, particularly to the discussion held on
08.03.2007 at the time of introduction of the Bill, which was the precursor,
which later matured into the Sports Act. The Minister of Parliamentary Affairs
and Minister of Information and Broadcasting in his speech stated as under:-
> "There were two things to be taken into account while this issue came before
> us. Firstly, the uplinking of a game from India to outside, and, secondly,
> downlinking a game from outside to India. There was a guideline duly
> approved by the Cabinet that: "Please do share live feed to Doordarshan to
> support those viewers who do not have any cable network." Indian population
> in the remote areas want to watch their popular LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
> 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 21 of 52 games, but they are always deprived for not
> having wider support to the games ..."
> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx "As you know, the terrestrial network belong
> to Prasar Bharati, and it has the widest coverage so far as the common
> people are concerned, whom we call aam admi within the villages. They were
> crying that in spite of the Government guidelines, they could not watch the
> game."
31\. In this backdrop, Dr Singhvi submitted that the respondents cannot be
permitted to carry the live broadcasting signals of cricket matches of
national importance in Prasar Bharati‟s channels, which are to be compulsorily
carried by the cable operators by virtue of Section 8 of the CTN Act.
32\. Mr Amit Sibal, appearing on behalf of the BCCI, submitted that the manner
in which the respondents have operated the provisions of Section 8 of the CTN
Act, grants an illegitimate benefit to Doordarshan and cable operators at the
cost of BCCI. He submitted that BCCI survives on media rights and not on gate
receipts. If the media rights are whittled, ultimately, the sport of cricket
would suffer. Mr Sibal referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case of
Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India and
Others v. Cricket Association of Bengal and Others: 1995 (2) SCC 161, where
BCCI has been recognized as LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 22
of 52 a sports organizer as distinct from a business organization. The Supreme
Court observed as under:-
> "75. It can hardly be denied that sport is an expression of self. In an
> athletic or individual event, the individual expresses himself through his
> individual feat. In a team event such as cricket, football, hockey etc.,
> there is both individual and collective expression. It may be true that what
> is protected by Article 19(1)(a) is an expression of thought and feeling and
> not of the physical or intellectual process or skill. It is also true that a
> person desiring to telecast sports events when he is not himself a
> participant in the game, does not seek to exercise his right of self
> expression. However, the right to freedom of speech and expression also
> includes the right to educate, to inform and to entertain and also the right
> to be educated, informed and entertained. The former is the right of the
> telecaster and the latter of the viewers. The right to telecast sporting
> event will therefore also include the right to educate and inform the
> present and the prospective sportsmen interested in the particular game and
> also to inform and entertain the lovers of the game. Hence, when a
> telecaster desires to telecast a sporting event, it is incorrect to say that
> the free speech element is absent from his right. The degree of the element
> will depend upon the character of the telecaster who claims the right. An
> organiser such as the BCCI or CAB in the present case which are indisputably
> devoted to the promotion of the game of cricket, cannot be placed in the
> same scale as the business organisations whose only intention is to make as
> large a profit as can be made by telecasting the game. Whereas it can be
> said that there is hardly any free speech element in the right to telecast
> when it is asserted by the latter, it will be a warped and cussed view to
> take when the former claim the same right, and contend that in claiming the
> right to telecast the cricket LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page
> 23 of 52 matches organised by them, they are asserting the right to make
> business out of it. The sporting organisations such as BCCI / CAB which are
> interested in promoting the sport or sports are under an obligation to

> their duty to do so. The promotion of sports also includes its
> popularization through all legitimate means. For this purpose, they are duty
> bound to select the best means and methods to reach the maximum number of
> listeners and viewers. Since at present, radio and TV are the most
> efficacious methods, thanks to the technological development, the sports
> organisations like BCCI / CAB will be neglecting their duty in not exploring
> the said media and in not employing the best means available to them to
> popularise the game. That while pursuing their objective of popularising the

> earn some revenue, will not convert either them into commercial
> organisations or the right claimed by them to explore the said means, into a
> commercial right or interest. It must further be remembered that sporting

> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
> 81\. It is unnecessary to repeat what we have stated while dealing with the
> first contention earlier, with regard to the character of BCCI / CAB, the
> nature of and the purpose for which the right to access to telecast is
> claimed by them. As pointed out is not possible to hold that what the

> One wishes that such a contention was not advanced."
> (Underlining added)
> 33\. It was further contended by Mr Sibal that in the preamble of the 2007
> Act, the very important words, "on a free to air basis" cannot be ignored

> Sports Act was to provide access to the largest number of viewers, "on a

> thereof.
34\. Mr Kuhad, the learned Additional Solicitor General of India, appearing on
behalf of Prasar Bharati and the Union of India submitted that broadcasting
has always been a State monopoly and has two elements. The first being the
programme content and the second being the aspect of broadcasting itself
which, in itself has three further elements of uplinking, downlinking and
distribution. He submitted that airways operate in different frequencies. Some
are reserved for the police and defence, etc. and some are reserved for
television etc. A range of frequencies is known as a spectrum. He referred to
the Supreme Court decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union
of India: 2012 (3) SCC 1 to contend that the 2G Spectrum was regarded as a
national resource. He submitted that approximately 155 million households all
over India are connected to television. Out of these, 95 million households
are connected through cable. 55 million households are within the reach of DTH
networks. Only about 4.6 million households are connected via the terrestrial
networks of Prasar Bharati. He submitted that ESPN / STAR wants that free
broadcasting should be limited to these 4.6 million terrestrial connections.
The learned ASG made the following five propositions:-
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 27 of 52
> (1) Due to its nature, the exercise of medium‟s rights has tremendous impact
> and implications on a citizen‟s right to know and receive information
> encompassed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India and,
> therefore, it is the primary duty of the State to regulate it in public
> interest;
> (2) Since broadcasting is an activity, which is based on the utilization of
> natural resources, it brings within its character, the public trust doctrine
> which entails that a natural resource cannot be used for maximization of
> profits of private entities, but should be used for the maximization of
> public interest. Consequently, broadcasting is subject to public trust
> obligations and regulations;
> (3) A citizen being a member of society, enjoys cultural rights which extend
> to his / her right to access of cultural content;
> (4) The spectrum is a scarce resource and the community has an inalienable
> right to utilize that natural resource so as to secure access to the content
> flowing through the spectrum;
> (5) Broadcasting, because of its importance, has throughout the world been
> held by States as a monopoly. By virtue of the Indian Telegraph Act 1885
> read with the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, the State, in India,
> continues to enjoy the right to maintain this monopoly. Thus, the state has
> absolute freedom to regulate the grant of licences to LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
> 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 28 of 52 broadcast with reference to such conditions
> as are in consonance with public interest.
35\. With regard to public trust doctrine, it was submitted that modern
industrial and post-industrial corporations control such a large extent of
economic and social activities that they have a wide and pervasive impact on
the lives of most people. It was further submitted that the public right to
use the natural resources cannot be permitted to be impacted by private
agreement. Reliance was placed on the Supreme Court decision in Reliance
Natural Resources Ltd v. Reliance Industries Ltd: 2010 (7) SCC 1 (para
151). A reference was also made to paragraph 75 of the Supreme Court decision
in the 2G Spectrum case [Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Others v.
Union of India and Others: 2012 (3) SCC 1], wherein the Supreme Court observed
as under:-
> "75. The State is empowered to distribute natural resources. However, as
> they constitute public property/national asset, while distributing natural
> resources, the State is bound to act in consonance with the principles of
> equality and public trust and ensure that no action is taken which may be
> detrimental to public interest. Like any other State action,
> constitutionalism must be reflected at every stage of the distribution of
> natural resources. In Article 39(b) of the Constitution it has been provided
> that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community
> should be so distributed so as to best sub-serve the common good, but no
> comprehensive legislation has been enacted to generally define natural
> resources and a framework for their protection. of course, environment laws
> enacted by Parliament and State legislatures LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07
> & 9610/07 Page 29 of 52 deal with specific natural resources, i.e., Forest,
> Air, Water, Costal Zones, etc."
> (Underlining added)
> 36\. A reference was made to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in
> Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. et al. v. Federal Communications et al.:
512 US 622 (1994). The question before the Supreme Court pertained to Sections
4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act 1992\.
Those provisions required cable television systems to devote a portion of
their channels to the transmission of local broadcast television stations. The
question was whether such provisions abridged the freedom of speech or of the
press in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. It was noted
in the said decision that in contrast to commercial broadcast stations, which
transmit signals at no charge to viewers and generate revenues by selling time
to advertisers, cable systems charge subscribers a monthly fee for the right
to receive cable programming and rely to a lesser extent on advertising. An
argument was raised that the must carry regulations were content based and the
object behind those provisions was to promote speech of a favoured content.
This argument was repelled by the US Supreme Court. It was observed that the
overriding objective behind enacting the must carry provisions was not to
favour programming of a particular subject matter, view point or format, but
rather to preserve access to free television programming for the 40 per cent
of Americans without cable. The said decision was cited by the learned ASG in
order to draw a parallel with the similar must carry obligation cast by LPA
1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 30 of 52 Section 8 of the CTN Act
insofar as the two Doordarshan channels were concerned.
37\. A reference was made to an article - "Indian DTH Industry: A Strategic
Analysis" - by Dheeraj Girhotra, which was published in March 2012 in the
International Journal of Marketing, Financial Services and Management
Research. This was cited in support of the submission that there was rapid
growth of the DTH networks in India and that the people were switching over
from terrestrial to DTH or cable networks.
38\. Mr Kuhad made a reference to the European Union Directive - Television
Without Frontiers, which was adopted in 1989 and amended in 1997\. Article
3(a)(1) of the European Union Directive was referred to and the same reads as
under:-
> "Each Member State may take measures in accordance with Community law to
> ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an
> exclusive basis events which are regarded by that Member State as being of
> major importance for society in such a way as to deprive a substantial
> proportion of the public in that Member State of the possibility of
> following such events via live coverage or deferred coverage on free
> television. If it does so, the Member State concerned shall draw up a list
> of designated events, national or non- national, which it considers to be of
> major importance for society."
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 31 of 52
39\. On the basis of the above extract, it was contended that the objective of
providing live coverage on free television was to enable the substantial
proportion of the public to follow events of major importance to society.
Similarly, the position in India is that sporting events of the national
importance are to be accessible to major sections of society on a free basis.
40\. Mr Kuhad then referred to Broadcasting laws of sporting events in
Australia. He submitted that during investigations into the possible social,
economic and technical ramifications of the introduction of cable and
subscription television to Australia in 1982, free-to-air broadcasters had
argued that siphoning of programmes would be an inevitable consequence of a
pay television environment and that it would have considerable social costs
for audiences. It was submitted that after weighing the findings of these
investigations, the Government of Australia decided to impose an anti-
siphoning regime on pay television which conferred power to introduce an anti-
siphoning list and to specify events that should be televised free to the
public. It was contended that siphoning refers to the practice used by the pay
television broadcasters by which they appropriate, or „siphon off‟ certain
events that have been traditionally shown on free-to-air television so that
viewers who do not subscribe to their services are unable to view those
events. It was contended that in Australia, the regime was put in place
inasmuch as it was found to be in public interest for all the people to be
able to see important events that reflect Australia‟s national identity and
that public interest was imperfectly served if important sporting events were
to migrate permanently to pay television. It is for this reason that
governments LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 32 of 52 impose
licence conditions and regulations on free-to-air broadcasters which oblige
those broadcasters to act in the public interest. It was further submitted by
Mr Kuhad that the must carry obligations, such as those to be found in Section
8 of the CTN Act, is not specific to India and is an international phenomenon.
It is essential to effectuate the public rights to access television which
provides the public with information as regards events of national importance,
including the sporting events.
41\. Referring to the Supreme Court decision in Novartis AG v. Union of India
& Others: 2013 (6) SCC 1, it was submitted that the Supreme Court had, in the
said decision, observed that the best way to understand a law is to know the
reason for it. The Supreme Court observed as under:-
> "25. It is easy to know why Section 5 was deleted but to understand the
> import of the amendments in Clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) and the
> amendments in Section 3 it is necessary to find out the concerns of
> Parliament, based on the history of the patent law in the country, when it
> made such basic changes in the Patents Act. What were the issues the
> legislature was trying to address? What was the mischief Parliament wanted
> to check and what were the objects it intended to achieve through these
> amendments ?
> 26\. The best way to understand a law is to know the reason for it. In Utkal
> Contractors and Joinery Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Orissa and Ors.:
> (1987) 3 SCC 279, Justice Chinnappa Reddy, speaking for the Court, said:
> „9. ... A statute is best understood if we know the reason for it. The
> reason for a statute is the safest guide to its interpretation. The words of
> a statute take their colour from the reason for it. How do we discover the
> reason for LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 33 of 52 a statute?
> There are external and internal aids. The external aids are statement of
> Objects and Reasons when the Bill is presented to Parliament, the reports of
> committees which preceded the Bill and the reports of Parliamentary
> Committees. Occasional excursions into the debates of Parliament are
> permitted. Internal aids are the preamble, the scheme and the provisions of
> the Act. Having discovered the reason for the statute and so having set the
> sail to the wind, the interpreter may proceed ahead."
> (Emphasis added)
> 27\. Again in Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and
> Investment Co. Ltd. and Ors.: (1987) 1 SCC 424 Justice Reddy said:
> "33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the
> bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture,
> context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are
> important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual
> interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we
> know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read,
> first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by
> phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its
> enactment, with the glasses of the statute- maker, provided by such context,
> its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and
> appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses
> provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a
> whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word
> is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No
> part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation.
> Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything

42\. A reference was also made to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
Sports Act which reads as under:-
> "Objects and Reasons The distribution of broadcasting signals of sporting
> events of public interest in India is characterized by a few dominant

43\. On the basis of the above, it was submitted that the object was to ensure
that the citizens right to be informed freely, truthfully and objectively was
fully protected and that the Prasar Bharati does not stray from the objective
of ensuring adequate coverage to the country‟s diverse culture and of catering
to the various sections of the society. This was in consonance of the citizens
fundamental rights enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution to
receive information. Broadcasting represented a means for securing this
constitutional goal. A reference was made to Section 12(2)(b) of the Prasar
Bharati Act which spelt out the objective of safeguarding the citizen‟s right
to be informed freely, truthfully and objectively on all matters of public
interest, national or international, and of presenting a fair and balanced
flow of information, including contrasting views without advocating any
opinion or ideology of its own. A reference was also made to Section 12(2)(e)
of the Prasar Bharati Act to emphasise that one of the objectives of Prasar
Bharati was to provide adequate coverage to sports and games so as to
encourage healthy competition and the spirit of sportsmanship. Section
12(2)(n) was referred to inasmuch as it emphasizes the objective of Prasar
Bharati of providing a comprehensive broadcast coverage through the choice of
appropriate technology and the best utilization of the broadcast frequencies
available and ensuring high quality reception. A reference was also made to
Section 12(3)(a). All these provisions, according to the learned ASG,
indicated that the rights of LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 37
of 52 citizens to receive information are of vital importance and whenever
there is a conflict, the rights of private broadcasters have to give way to
the rights of citizens.
44\. With reference to Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting v.
Cricket Association of Bengal (supra), Mr Kuhad submitted that Article 19
(1)(a) of the Constitution was a two-fold right. It entailed a right to
express as also a right to receive information / to be informed. He submitted
that media, including the television, is the mechanism to effectuate this
right. He further submitted that the rights of citizens were sacrosanct and
that the right of the citizens as viewers and listeners is paramount and not
the rights of the broadcasters. He submitted that the Sports Act was enacted
to effectuate these constitutional rights of the citizens. Furthermore, the
expression appearing in Section 3 \- "to enable them to retransmit the same on
its terrestrial networks" - was aimed at stipulating that the said live
broadcasting signal could be carried only over free-to-air channels and could
not be exploited or re-sold for commercial purposes. This was in line with the
must carry obligations stipulated under Section 8 of the CTN Act of 1995
whereunder, inter alia, two Doordarshan channels have to be carried by the
cable operators. He also emphasized that DTH operators since 2006, were also
complying with the must carry obligations by virtue of an amendment in their
licence conditions referred to earlier in this judgment. Consequently, it was
submitted that there was no conflict between the provisions of Section 3 of
the Sports Act and Section 8 of the CTN Act.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 38 of 52
45\. On the basis of all these submissions, Mr Kuhad submitted that the appeal
as well as the writ petitions were liable to be dismissed.
46\. By way of the rejoinder, Dr Singhvi reiterated that Prasar Bharati can
only re-transmit the live broadcasting signals on its own terrestrial networks
or DTH networks as stipulated in Section 3 of the Sports Act. It cannot
further be re-transmitted through any private cable or DTH networks. He
submitted that broadcasting in India was defined into two platforms, one being
the Prasar Bharati Platform and the other being the non-Prasar Bharati
platform. The simultaneous sharing of the live broadcasting signal as
stipulated under Section 3 of the Sports Act is to enable Prasar Bharati to
re- transmit the same on its networks, that is, on the Prasar Bharati
platform. Prasar Bharati cannot re-transmit the said live broadcasting signals
through a private network as that would entail broadcasting through a non-
Prasar Bharati platform.
47\. Dr Singhvi further submitted that the arguments of Mr Kuhad with regard
to the spectrum were irrelevant. He submitted that this case has nothing to do
with the spectrum. The question here is only with regard to the content. He
submitted that the CTN Act must be read in the context of Section 3 of the
Sports Act and that limits the scope to the terrestrial and DTH networks of
Prasar Bharati. It was further submitted by Dr Singhvi that the Sports Act was
an expropriatory legislation and Section 3 thereof is LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos.
8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 39 of 52 in the nature of compulsory acquisition of the
content owners property for the purposes of re-transmission on Prasar
Bharati‟s terrestrial and DTH networks. On the other hand, Section 8 of the
CTN Act is an exception to the Interconnect Regulations 2004 which provides
that a broadcaster of television channel cannot insist on any distribution
platform to carry its channel whereas every broadcaster of TV channels is
obliged to provide its signal to every distribution platform, on a non
discriminatory basis. He reiterated that Section 3 of the Sports Act was a
later special law dealing with compulsory acquisition of content, whereas
Section 8 of the CTN Act was an earlier general law dealing with the cable
television network. Therefore, Section 8 needed to be interpreted in such a
way that it did not take away anything from Section 3 of the Sports Act. He
further submitted that Prasar Bharati had no power to share any third party
content de hors Section 3 of the Sports Act. Thus, when Prasar Bharati cannot
directly share any content under Section 8 of the CTN Act, it also has no
authority to indirectly acquire content under Section 8 of the CTN Act. It
also has no authority to indirectly acquire content under Section 3 of the
Sports Act and then voluntarily share the same under Section 8 of the CTN Act.
He further emphasized that any Doordarshan channel, which is carried by a
private platform under Section 8 of the CTN Act, is not free to the viewers.
He referred to Section 4A of the CTN Act to indicate that it provides that the
cable operator was entitled to charge a Basic Tier Fee from the subscriber for
providing free-to-air channels at a tariff specified by the Tariff Order. The
applicable Tariff Order dated 21.07.2010 specified that a cable operator could
charge Rs 150/- as the Basic Tier Fee for providing access even for LPA
1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 40 of 52 free-to-air channels. This
fee would be chargeable to a subscriber even if he / she did not avail any pay
channels and only subscribes to free-to-air channels, including the
Doordarshan channels. Thus, the compulsory carrying of the Doordarshan
channels under Section 8 of the CTN Act does not mean that they would be free
for the subscriber of a cable connection. It was, therefore, contended that
the Doordarshan channels would be truly free to the consumers only when they
are accessed through Prasar Bharati‟s terrestrial and DTH networks.
48\. Finally, it was submitted that the object and purpose of Section 3 of the
Sports Act was to make available the telecast of the sporting events of
national importance to such subscribers who had no access to such events.
These were those subscribers, who had no cable or DTH connection and only had
a Doordarshan‟s terrestrial or DTH connection which was free in the hands of
the subscribers. By carrying the shared signals on channels, which are
compulsorily carried on private cables and DTH platforms, Prasar Bharati is
making available the shared signals on platforms where they are already
available and is thereby offering the content to subscribers in direct
competition to the broadcaster, who is the owner of that content. It was
submitted that Section 3 of the Sports Act is not about creating of a
competing entity but about availability of live broadcast signals to those
subscribers, who had no access. It was, therefore, contended that the live
broadcast signals, which were mandatorily to be shared under Section 3 of the
Sports Act ought not to be permitted to be carried by cable operators.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 41 of 52
49\. Mr Sudhir Chandra, in rejoinder, reiterated his opening arguments. He
also submitted that the content rights owner had two rights under the
Copyrights Act, 1957. But, we need not go into that as aspect of the matter as
we are concerned only with the interplay between Section 3 of the Sports Act
and Section 8 of the CTN Act in the backdrop of the constitutional rights of
the citizens. He reiterated that the case was not about spectrum, but about
content. Furthermore, the limitation with regard to sharing was clearly spelt
out in Section 3 of the Sports Act itself and the same was limited to the re-
transmission of the live broadcasting signals on Prasar Bharati‟s terrestrial
networks and DTH networks. He further submitted that it is an administrative
act on the part of Prasar Bharati to carry a particular content on a
particular channel. There is no compulsion on Prasar Bharati to carry the
shared live broadcasting signal on a channel which has been notified under
Section 8 of the CTN Act. He also referred to paragraphs 6 and 79 of the
Supreme Court decision in the case of Secretary, Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting v. Cricket Association of Bengal (supra) which read as under:-
> "6. The telecasting is of three types, (a) terrestrial, (b) cable and (c)
> satellite. In the first case, the signal is generated by the camera
> stationed at the spot of the event, and the signal is then sent to the

> approach."
50\. Mr Sibal, appearing on behalf of the BCCI, reiterated his opening
arguments.
51\. There is no quarrel with the proposition advanced by the learned ASG that
a citizen has not only a right to expression, but also a right to receive
information. If, in any manner, this right to receive information is
curtailed, LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 44 of 52 the centre
can always step in to protect the same. It is for this reason that by virtue
of Section 3 of the Sports Act, content owners in respect of sporting events
of national importance are mandatorily required to simultaneously share the
live broadcasting signal of sporting events of national importance with Prasar
Bharati to enable them to re-transmit the same on its terrestrial networks and
DTH networks. At the point of time when the CTN Act came into being, Prasar
Bharati, through the medium of Doordarshan, had the widest coverage insofar as
television networks were concerned. Cable operators had recently entered into
the field. And, by virtue of Section 8, they were compulsorily required to
carry DD1 and DD (News channels). The idea behind that was that programming of
national importance should be carried to the maximum number of persons. There
is also no dispute with the proposition that a public right cannot be changed
by a private agreement, but, in the present case, it is not a private
agreement that is in question. But, a provision of the statute, namely,
Section 3 of the Sports Act.
52\. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the ESPN / STAR and BCCI are,
in our view, correct in submitting that Section 3 is an expropriatory
provision and that the same has to be construed strictly and in such a manner
that it places the least burden on the expropriated owner. If one were to
interpret Section 3 in this manner, it would be evident that the object of
simultaneous sharing of the live broadcasting signal with Prasar Bharati is
only to enable them (Prasar Bharati) to re-transmit the same on its
terrestrial networks and DTH networks. Strictly speaking, these networks have
to be those of Prasar Bharati and not of private players, such as the LPA
1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 45 of 52 cable network operators.
Section 2(1) of the Sports Act does give an indication, when it defines
"terrestrial television service" that a terrestrial network carries signals
over the air using land based transmitters which are directly received through
receiver sets by the public. It is obvious that the expression "terrestrial
networks" used in Section 3 of the Sports Act must be read in this context. It
does not involve the carrying of the signals through a cable network. In the
same fashion, the meaning of DTH networks can be discerned from the definition
given to "DTH broadcasting service" in Section 2(j) of the Sports Act. Read in
this manner, DTH networks would entail multi-channel distribution of
programmes directly to the subscribers‟ premises without passing through an
intermediary, such as a cable operator by uplinking to a satellite. In other
words, DTH network also does not entail the signals passing through a cable
operator. Thus, in either eventuality, that is, in the case of a terrestrial
network or a DTH network, the intervention of a cable operator is specifically
ruled out.
53\. This being the case, when we strictly interpret the provisions of Section
3 of the Sports Act, it becomes clear that the simultaneously shared live
broadcasting signal can only be re-transmitted by Prasar Bharati without the
intervention of a cable operator. In other words, such a shared live
broadcasting signal cannot be carried through a cable operator. This
limitation is not by way of a private treaty, but by way of a statutory
provision. It is not as if public interest is being given a go-by for the sake
of private interest.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 46 of 52
54\. There is logic and reason behind interpreting Section 3 of the said Act
in the manner suggested on behalf of ESPN / STAR and BCCI and, as indicated
above. The logic being discernible from the very object and purpose of the
Sports Act. The object and purpose of the Sports Act is to provide access to
the largest number of the viewers, on a free-to-air basis on sporting events
of national importance through mandatory sharing of sports broadcasting
channels with Prasar Bharati. There is merit in what Dr Singhvi submitted that
the purpose and object behind Section 3 of the Sports Act is not to re-
transmit the live broadcasting signals in such a manner so as to reach those
consumers / subscribers, who, in any event, are connected by cable. It is
essentially directed towards those citizens who do not have access to cable
television and only have access to the terrestrial and DTH networks of Prasar
Bharati.
55\. We also agree with the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing
on behalf of ESPN / STAR that the issue raised in the present matters is not
with regard to the spectrum, but with regard to the content. ESPN / STAR has
paid huge sum of money (Rs 3851 crores) to BCCI to purchase the content rights
for the period April 2012 to March 2018. It has purchased those rights from
BCCI which has been recognized as an organizer of the Sports (Cricket) and
BCCI has also been recognized as being fuelled by the motive to promote the
game of cricket rather than for pure business gain. The learned counsel for
the BCCI had also submitted that the BCCI derives its substantial revenue from
media rights and not from gate receipts. It is these revenues, which are spent
for the development of LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 47 of 52
sports and sporting facilities relating to cricket all over India. If these
revenues are affected, it is ultimately the sport of cricket which would
suffer. Therefore, there has to be protection of the value of the content
rights without, of course, impinging on the public interest rights of
citizens. We may point out that by virtue of Section 12(3)(c) of the Prasar
Bharati Act, Prasar Bharati is empowered to negotiate for purchase of, or
otherwise acquire, programmes and rights or privileges in respect of sports
and other events, films, serials, occasions, meetings, functions or incidents
of public interest for broadcasting and to establish procedures for the
allocation of such programmes, rights or privileges to the services.
Accordingly, it was open for Prasar Bharati to have also negotiated for the
purchase of the content rights in respect of the sporting events of national
importance, including cricket matches. If that had been the case, Prasar
Bharati would have been free to direct the cable operators to carry the live
broadcasting signals of cricket matches on cable networks. That would be so
because the content rights would belong to Prasar bharati. But, by virtue of
Section 3 of the Sports Act, although Prasar Bharati has not paid for it, the
live broadcasting has to be shared by the content rights owner with Prasar
Bharati, compulsorily. It is in the nature of a compulsory exaction. But, it
must be read with the limitation prescribed in the Section itself and, that
is, to enable Prasar Bharati to re-transmit the same on its terrestrial
networks and DTH networks. It cannot expand this manner of acquisition to such
an extent as to virtually become the content rights owner itself.
LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 48 of 52
56\. To be clear, the following diagram gives the manner in which the whole
system operates:-
> BCCI Rights ESPN / STAR [„Limited‟ encrypted] SATELLITE e e Own Channels
> Shared With ESPN Star Star Star Star Cricket ESPN Sports Cricket Sports 2 HD
> HD DD un-e SATELLITE DTH Cable Operators DD Kendras un-e (Terrestrial
> Networks) Homes Homes Homes LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 49
> of 52
57\. BCCI is the content rights owner. It has sold these rights to ESPN /
STAR, which, in turn, sends the live feed in an encrypted form to its
satellites. From the said satellite, the feed is sent to its own channels
(ESPN / STAR Sports, STAR Cricket, STAR Sports 2, STAR Cricket HD and ESPN HD)
for distribution either through their own DTH networks or through cable
operators. In either eventuality, they are subscribed services. Alongwith
signals sent through their own distribution channels, ESPN / STAR shares the
signals with Prasar Bharati, which is sent to Prasar Bharati in an encrypted
form. Prasar Bharati re-transmits the signals in an encrypted form to its
satellite, which, then streams that signal to three different networks. The
three networks being the DTH network of Prasar Bharati, the DD Kendras
(terrestrial networks) and private cable operators through the must carry
obligation stipulated under Section 8 of the CTN Act. Thus, cable operators
have access to the broadcast of the sporting events through two different
channels. One through the channels of ESPN / STAR and the other through the
channels of Doordarshan. While, the former is to be paid for, the latter is
free.
58\. From the above, it is evident that what ESPN / STAR and BCCI are
objecting to is not the transmission of the signals through the DTH and
terrestrial networks of Prasar Bharati, but the free transmission of the
signals by Prasar Bharati through cable operators. This, according to ESPN /
STAR, has hit them in two ways. The first being by reduced advertisement
revenue and the second being by reduced subscription revenue. Those homes,
which were connected via cable networks would have paid for LPA 1327/07 & WPC
Nos. 8458/07 & 9610/07 Page 50 of 52 receiving the live broadcast signals had
Prasar Bharati through Doordarshan not provided the same free of cost to the
cable operators. Although there is an argument that by virtue of Section 3(2)
of the Sports Act, the advertisement revenue received by Doordarshan in
respect of the shared content was also to be shared in the ratio of not less
than 75:25, it still does not cater to the loss of subscription revenue.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the advertisement revenue, which
ESPN / STAR would have made on its own, would not be matched by Prasar Bharati
and, therefore, the provision of Section 3(2) of the said Act was no
consolation for providing the feed free to the cable operators.
59\. As a result of the foregoing discussion, the interplay between the
provisions of Section 3 of the Sports Act and Section 8 of the CTN Act have to
be read in such a manner that the shared live broadcasting signal, which
Prasar Bharati receives from ESPN / STAR, should not be placed in the channels
of Doordarshan which are to be compulsorily carried by the cable operators
under Section 8 of the CTN Act. We do not agree with the view taken by the
learned single Judge in PW(C) 7655/2007, which forms the subject matter of LPA
No.1327/2007, that carrying sports in a designated Doordarshan channel is a
matter of policy. In our view, it is a matter of administration. But, even if
we regard it as a matter of policy, such policy cannot override the statutory
provisions contained in Section 3 of the Sports Act in the manner which we
have interpreted. The appeal as well as WP(C) 8458/2007 are allowed to the
extent that the live broadcasting signal shared by ESPN / STAR by virtue of
Section 3 of the Sports Act with Prasar LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 &
9610/07 Page 51 of 52 Bharati, shall not be carried in the designated
Doordarshan channels under the must carry obligation cast by Section 8 of the
CTN Act on cable operators. This shall operate prospectively. WP(C) 9610/2007
is dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own costs.

59\. As a result of the foregoing discussion, the interplay between the
provisions of Section 3 of the Sports Act and Section 8 of the CTN Act have to
be read in such a manner that the shared live broadcasting signal, which
Prasar Bharati receives from ESPN / STAR, should not be placed in the channels
of Doordarshan which are to be compulsorily carried by the cable operators
under Section 8 of the CTN Act. We do not agree with the view taken by the
learned single Judge in PW(C) 7655/2007, which forms the subject matter of LPA
No.1327/2007, that carrying sports in a designated Doordarshan channel is a
matter of policy. In our view, it is a matter of administration. But, even if
we regard it as a matter of policy, such policy cannot override the statutory
provisions contained in Section 3 of the Sports Act in the manner which we
have interpreted. The appeal as well as WP(C) 8458/2007 are allowed to the
extent that the live broadcasting signal shared by ESPN / STAR by virtue of
Section 3 of the Sports Act with Prasar LPA 1327/07 & WPC Nos. 8458/07 &
9610/07 Page 51 of 52 Bharati, shall not be carried in the designated
Doordarshan channels under the must carry obligation cast by Section 8 of the
