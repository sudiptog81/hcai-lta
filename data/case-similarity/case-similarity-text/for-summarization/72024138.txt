No. 60/2/14 Page No.2/3 The State vs Depender Mehta client with the commission
of any of the offences.
4 After hearing both sides and going through the entire material placed before
me, I find myself in concurrence with the observations of the Ld. Trial Court
that merely because the accused/respondent was arrested on the basis of
disclosure of co­accused and there is no document in respect of which any
forgery as alleged by the prosecution has been done by the accused, charge
cannot be framed for any of the offences against the accused. Therefore, I
find no illegality and infirmity in the impugned order warranting any
interference of this court in exercise of its revisional powers and
jurisdiction. Therefore, revision petition is dismissed being devoid of any
merits. 5 TCR be sent back to the concerned court alongwith copy of this
order. 6 Revision file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

     The State vs Depender Mehta
Additional PP against the impugned order dated 22.1.2013 passed by Sh. Sameer
Bajpai the Ld. ACMM­1, Dwarka, New Delhi whereby the accused was discharged by
the court of learned ACMM­1, Dwarka for the offences alleged to have been
committed by him on the ground that there was no direct or indirect evidence
available on record to link him with any of the offences as he was arrested in
this case merely on the basis of disclosure statement made by co­accused.
2 Ld. Addl. PP for the petitioner/State has vehemently argued that while
passing the impugned order, the Ld. ACMM had completely ignored the statements
of the witnesses recorded by the IO during investigation under section 161
Cr.P.C and from the perusal of the same, there was sufficient material on
record to have framed the charges against the respondent herein. 3 Ld. Defence
Counsel on the other hand has countered these submissions of the Ld. Addl. PP
for the petitioner on the ground that in the given set of facts, the
allegations against the accused are not related to providing of a fake visa to
the co­accused but though the visa and passports were stated to be genuine.
However, as per the allegations, visa was obtained on the basis of forged
documents and by fraudulent means, hence it is not a case solely based on oral
testimony rather it is a case which purely rests on the documentary evidence
and as such no documentary evidence is available on record to connect his CR
