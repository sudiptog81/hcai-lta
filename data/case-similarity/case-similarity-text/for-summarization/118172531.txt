                                              ORDER
Per Shri A.T.Varkey, JM This appeal preferred by the revenue is against the
order of the Ld. CIT(A)-1, Kolkata dated 29.12.2017 for AY 2014-15.
2\. Ground nos. 1 and 2 of the appeal of revenue is against the action of Ld.
CIT(A) in deleting the disallowance on account of trading purchases of
Rs.79,55,08,653/- as unexplained expenditure u/s. 69C of the Income-tax Act,
1961 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") and also deleting the disallowance
on account of trading sales of Rs.79,95,09,650/- as unexplained cash credit
u/s. 68 of the Act.
3\. Briefly stated facts of the case as observed by AO are that the trading
purchase for Rs.79,55,08,653/- from M/s. Hanuman Trading Co. ,M/s. KRVL Fabcom
Pvt Ltd and M/s. Top ITW was unpaid in full. The trading sales of
Rs.79,95,09,650 to M/s MSP Metallics Ltd. was also not received. The assessee
was asked to furnish all the bills, road challans with the evidence of routes
of transport. The AO took note of the following deficiencies. That only ledger
account of purchase and sales were furnished. No documents in support of these
inter-stale purchases and sales (as apparent from ledger accounts) was
furnished that  2 ITA No. 491/Kol/2018 M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY-
2014-15 would evidence movement of the goods by mode (description) of
transport, cleared through various government check-posts. No sales tax record
was available since the alleged goods were allegedly not subject to sales tax.
No actual payments were made or received for the alleged trade. In absence of
these documents, the AO was of the opinion that the trade shown in the books
was sham and bogus. Therefore, the sum of Rs.79,95,09,650 credited in the
books of the assessee as sale was treated as cash credit u/s 68 ; and the
expenditure of Rs.79,55,08,653 shown in the books of the books as unexplained
investment u/s 69C of the Act. Aggrieved, assessee preferred an appeal before
the Ld. CIT(A) who after analysing the case in details partly allowed the
assessee's grounds of appeal by directing that the AO to adopt the gross
profit ratio of 0.70% without allowing the deduction of other expenses claimed
by the assessee, since this being the first year of business operations and
there being no past history of comparing gross profit ratios. Aggrieved,
revenue is before us.
4\. We have heard rival submissions and gone through the facts and
circumstances of the case. We note that the assessee has returned a loss of
Rs.5,36,63,653/- for the year under consideration. The AO noted that the
assessee had shown to have traded by purchasing goods worth Rs.79,55,08,653/-
from three corporate parties and in turn had claimed to have sold it to M/s.
MSP Metalicks Ltd. (M/s. MML) for Rs.79,95,09,650/-. When the AO asked the
assessee to produce evidence to substantiate the purchases and sales,
according to AO, the assessee only furnished ledger accounts of purchases and
sales. However, according to AO the assessee failed to furnish all the bills,
road challans with the evidence of route of transport and evidence to show
that the goods were cleared through various government check posts; and
moreover according to AO, the assessee failed to produce any sales tax records
of the goods which was traded by the assessee on the plea that the goods were
agricultural products; and the AO taking note that no actual payments were
made or received for the alleged trade, so he concluded that the trade shown
in the books was sham and bogus and, therefore, the AO added the sum of
Rs.79,55,08,653/- shown as expenditure for purchase of goods as unexplained
investment u/s. 69C of the Act as well as the sum of Rs.79,95,09,650/-
credited in the books of the assessee as sales was  3 ITA No. 491/Kol/2018
M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY- 2014-15 treated as cash credit u/s. 68 of the
Act. On appeal, the Ld. CIT(A) taking note that the assessee's books were
audited by professional Chartered Accountant and the AO has not found any
fault/defect in the books of account or the accounting standard notified u/s.
145(2) of the Act, has not rejected the books as envisaged u/s. 145(3) of the
Act. The Ld. CIT(A) was of the opinion that the entire purchase and sales
could not be added. According to the Ld. CIT(A), only the income embedded in
the sales could be taxed and, therefore, he made an addition of 0.20% thereby
making an addition of gross profit at 0.70% and directed deletion of both the
additions made on account of purchase and sales figures. The Revenue has
assailed the action of Ld. CIT(A). We note that the assessee had explained to
the AO that the goods in question were exempt from sales tax being
agricultural implements/equipments for which no sales tax is leviable,
therefore, incurring of sales tax does not arise. It was also brought to the
notice of the AO that the entire sale transaction took place inside the State
only and not outside the state, so question of the goods passing through the
check posts does not arise. It was noted by the Ld. CIT(A) that the AO has not
rejected the books of account which have been audited by professional
Chartered Accountant. The AO has no where given a finding that the assessee
has not regularly followed the method of accounting as mandated u/s. 145(1) of
the Act. It is also not the case of the AO that the assessee has not computed
the income in accordance with the accounting standard notified u/s. 145(2) of
the Act which are the condition for invoking section 145(3) of the Act. The AO
has not found any fault about the correctness and completeness of the books of
account maintained by the assessee. It is noted that the breakup of the
business income earned by the assessee is as under:
4
ITA No. 491/Kol/2018 M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY- 2014-15
5\. The computation of income which is placed at page 8 of the paper book made
by the assessee in its return of income is as under:
6\. Thus, from a perusal of the aforesaid chart it can be seen that the AO has
accepted the gross profit of Rs.39,99,457/- (Rs.79,95,08,110 -
Rs.79,55,08,653) as declared by the assessee from the trading. From a perusal
of page 3 of the assessment order, the computation made by the AO for
determining the assessed income of the assessee started with the loss declared
by the assessee to the tune of Rs.5,36,63,653/-. Thus, we note that the AO has
accepted the gross profit from trading of goods at Rs.39,99,457/- which is
gross profit percentage of 0.50% on trading account. Thus, the action of the
AO on one hand doubting the purchases and sales of the very same goods on
which the assessee got profit of Rs.39,99,457/- has been accepted by the
action of the AO which is evident from page 3 of the assessment order. We also
note that the figures of purchase and sales has also been taken from the books
of account of the assessee only. However, the AO has disbelieved them on the
specious plea that the road challans, sales tax documents were not produced
etc. which the assessee has already explained. We note that the AO has not
made any enquiry whatsoever to find out the identity, creditworthiness and
genuineness of M/s. MML which had purchased the goods from the assessee. We
note that M/s. MML's documents which are placed from pages 28 to 70 of the
paper book reveals that it is a manufacturing company which manufactures steel
in its Integrated Steel Plant at Jhadsugda (Odisha). We note that M/s. MML is
a regular income tax assessee and its PAN is AACCA5907D and has been assessed
u/s. 143(3) of the Act for the assessment year under  5 ITA No. 491/Kol/2018
M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY- 2014-15 consideration i.e. AY 2014-15 vide
order dated 30.12.2016 by ACIT, C.C 3(2), Kolkata wherein the purchases made
by the company i.e. M/s. MML from the assessee has been accepted by the
department as genuine and also the corresponding sales made by it to the other
parties. It was also brought to our notice that the jurisdiction of M/s. MML
has been decentralized to DCIT, Circle-3(1) who is the same AO of the
assessee. We note that the confirmation of accounts received from M/s. MML
confirming the sales transactions are placed at page 28 to 34 of the paper
book. From the financials of M/s. MML, we note that the total revenue from
operation of the company ie. trading operations are Rs.37,797.89 lakhs (P&L
account placed at page 52 and schedule 15 of Balance Sheet placed at page 64
of the paper book. Corresponding to the above sales, it is noted that M/s. MML
has made purchases of Rs.38,561.10 lakhs which includes the purchase of
agricultural equipments from the assessee company (P&L Account page 52 and
schedule 18 of Balance Sheet page 65 of paper book) from which we note that at
Sl. No. 5, the assessee's name i.e. M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd. an amount of
Rs.79,95,08,110/- is reflected; and as per P& L Account and schedule 18 of
Balance sheet which is a purchase from 27 parties comes to
Rs.3,85,61,10,119/-. Thus, from the aforesaid documents, the sales made by the
assessee cannot be doubted since the AO for the assessment year under
consideration of M/s. MML (ACIT, CC-3(2), Kolkata) has accepted the purchases
made from the assessee. In such a scenario and for the reasons given by the
Ld. CIT(A) which we fully concur, we confirm the action of the Ld. CIT(A) in
deleting the additions made by the AO on account of sales of agricultural
equipments by assessee and M/s. MML to the tune of Rs.,79,95,08,110/- .
7\. Coming to the purchases made by the assessee from three parties which we
will examine as under:
a) M/s. KRVLFabcom Pvt. Ltd. - The documents relating to M/s. KRVL Fabcom Pvt.
Ltd. is found placed at pages 82 to 85, 95-96 and 108 to 117 of the paper
book. The ledger account showing the details of purchase made by the assessee
are placed at page 82 to 85 of the paper book. Confirmation account received
from M/s. KRVL Fabcom Pvt. Ltd. confirming purchase transactions are even
placed at pages 95 to 96 of the paper book. The Balance Sheet is found placed
at pages 108 to 117 of the paper book. From the  6 ITA No. 491/Kol/2018 M/s.
Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY- 2014-15 financials of the company it is seen that
the total revenue from the operation is Rs.33,08,15,855/- (P&L Account page
no. 110 and schedule 11 of Balance Sheet placed at page 115 of the paper
book). Corresponding to the above sales M/s. KRVL Fabcom Pvt. Pvt. Ltd. has
made purchase of Rs.32,95,08,300/- (P&L Account placed at page 110 and
schedule 12 of Balance sheet palced at page 115 of the paper book). It is
noted that the entire sale made by M/s. KRVL Fabcom Pvt. Ltd. to the assessee
is disclosed at its income tax return. The PAN of M/s. KRVL Fabcom Pvt. Ltd.
is AAECK0101D. ITR acknowledgment is placed at page 108 of the paper book and
assessed by ITO, Wd-4(4), Kolkata.
b) Coming to M/s. Hanuman Trading Co. (Proprietress Smt. Manju Devi), PAN is
AIZPD8239E is assessed under ITO, Wd-25(1) Kolkata, filed the ITR
Acknowledgment found placed at page 103 of the paper book. Balance Sheet is
found at pages 104 to 107 of the paper book. Ledgers found placed at pages 86
to 90 of paper book. Confirmation of accounts placed at pages 92 to 94 of
paper book. It is also noted from the financials that the total sales of the
concern is Rs.44,40,13,573/- (P&L Account found at page 105 of paper book).
Corresponding to the above sales, the concern has made a purchase of
Rs.45,40,23,753/- (P&L Account placed at pages 105 of paper book.)
c) Coming next to the purchase made from M/s. V. S. Industries (proprietor
M/s. Vijhay Kr. Ladhania). The PAN is AAUPL9613L who is assessed under ITO,
Wd-43(2), Kolkata. The ledger account showing the details of purchase made by
assessee are placed at page 81 of the paper book. The confirmation of account
received from M/s. V. S. Industries confirming the purchase transactions are
placed at page 91 of the paper book. The Balance Sheet of the concern is
placed at pages 97 to 102 of the paper book. From a perusal of the financial
it is seen that the total sales of the concern is Rs.32,40,78,420/- (P&L
Account placed at page 99 of the paper book). Corresponding to the above
sales, the concern has made a purchase of Rs.30,34,07,135/-.
8\. Thus, we note that the additions have been made by the AO doubting the
purchases without making any enquiries was an arbitrary action in the light of
the identity from whom purchase of goods were made were furnished before the
AO and no action/enquiry was  7 ITA No. 491/Kol/2018 M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt.
Ltd., AY- 2014-15 conducted by the AO which action of the AO cannot be
countenanced. We note that the assessee had duly maintained the books of
account which were audited wherein the quantitative details of the stock was
provided. We agree with the Ld. Ld. CIT(A) that since the assessee was engaged
in trading activities, there could be no sale without actual purchase of
material. So, in such a scenario, the profit element embedded in the purchase
transaction to factorize for the profit earned by assessee would be only
sufficient in the light of the fact that the assessee is not in appeal against
the action of the Ld. CIT(A) which has increased the gross profit from 0.50%
to 0.70%. So, without rejecting the books of account which are audited, the
AO's action of adding the entire purchase and sale recorded in the books
cannot be sustained and, therefore, it was rightly deleted by the Ld. CIT(A).
Since the assessee is not in appeal, the action of the Ld. CIT(A) in
increasing the profit element embedded in the purchase and sale transaction by
which he has factorized for the profit earned by the assessee to 0.70% is
confirmed. Therefore, this ground of appeal of revenue is dismissed.
9\. Ground no. 3 of revenue's appeal is against the action of Ld. CIT(A) in
deleting the addition of Rs.30,59,380/- u/s. 14A of the Act. Briefly stated
facts as observed by the AO are that the assessee had investment in unquoted
share which are capable of yielding exempt income. The Ld. AR claimed no
expenditure had been incurred for earning the exempt income. According to AO,
in spite of this claim the provisions of section 14A applies in this case as
provided in sub clause (3) of the said section. The AO noted that in the
profit & loss account, expenditures on various heads were debited to arrive at
the taxable income of the assessee which included Rs.76,18,750/- paid as
interest. For the purpose of computing the total income under Chapter IV of
the Act, deduction is not allowed in respect of expenditure incurred by the
assessee in relation to income which does not form part of total income under
the Act. Since the AO was not satisfied with the claim made by the assessee
that no expenditure had been incurred in relation to income from dividend, and
since the assessee had incurred expenditure which is not directly attributable
to any particular income or receipt, he determined the amount of disallowance
of expenditure being Rs.30,59,380/- as per section 14A read with Rule 8D (i)
and (ii) of the I.
8
ITA No. 491/Kol/2018 M/s. Anup Enclave Pvt. Ltd., AY- 2014-15 T. Rules, 1962.
Aggrieved, assessee preferred an appeal before the Ld. CIT(A) who directed the
AO to delete the disallowance of Rs.30,59,380/-. Aggrieved, revenue is before
us.
10\. We have heard rival submissions and gone through the facts and
circumstances of the case. At the outset, it has been brought to our notice
that assessee has not earned any dividend income. Since the assessee has not
earned any dividend income, the invokation of section 14A read with Rule 8D of
the Rules was not warranted in the case of the assessee. For this proposition,
we rely on the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Chem
Investments Ltd. Vs. CIT 378 ITR 33 (Del.) wherein it was held that there
being no exempt income earned by the assessee, no disallowance u/s. 14A to be
made. Therefore, we uphold the action of the Ld. CIT(A) in deleting the
addition of Rs.30,59,380/- made by the AO applying sec. 14 A read with Rule 8D
of the Rules. Therefore, revenue's ground of appeal is dismissed.
11\. In the result, the appeal of revenue is dismissed.

Per Shri A.T.Varkey, JM This appeal preferred by the revenue is against the
order of the Ld. CIT(A)-1, Kolkata dated 29.12.2017 for AY 2014-15.
2\. Ground nos. 1 and 2 of the appeal of revenue is against the action of Ld.
CIT(A) in deleting the disallowance on account of trading purchases of
Rs.79,55,08,653/- as unexplained expenditure u/s. 69C of the Income-tax Act,

transport, cleared through various government check-posts. No sales tax record
was available since the alleged goods were allegedly not subject to sales tax.
No actual payments were made or received for the alleged trade. In absence of
these documents, the AO was of the opinion that the trade shown in the books
was sham and bogus. Therefore, the sum of Rs.79,95,09,650 credited in the
books of the assessee as sale was treated as cash credit u/s 68 ; and the
expenditure of Rs.79,55,08,653 shown in the books of the books as unexplained

the Ld. CIT(A) who after analysing the case in details partly allowed the
assessee's grounds of appeal by directing that the AO to adopt the gross
profit ratio of 0.70% without allowing the deduction of other expenses claimed
being no exempt income earned by the assessee, no disallowance u/s. 14A to be
made. Therefore, we uphold the action of the Ld. CIT(A) in deleting the
