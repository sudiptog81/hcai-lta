from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in

in India, the income of the business deemed under this clause to accrue or
arise in India shall be only such part of the income as is reasonably

will not be sufficient to make the non- resident liable to tax, if the sole
function of the agency is to purchase goods for export. 6 Where shares in
Indian companies are allotted in consideration for the machinery and plant,
the income embedded in the payments would be received in India as the shares

Where a foreign agent of Indian exporter operates in his own country and no
part of his income arises in India and his commission is usually remitted
directly to him and is not received by him or on his behalf in India, the
agent is not liable to income- tax in India on the commission. A non- resident
will not be liable to tax in India, on any income attributable to operations
confined to purchase of goods in India for export even though the nonresident
has an office or agency in India for this purpose. Where a non- resident
allows an Indian customer facilities of extended credit for payment there
would be no assessment merely for this reason provided that the contracts to
sell were made outside India and the sales were made on a principal to

of a non- resident which cannot reasonably be attributed to operations carried

the income embedded in the payments would be received in India as the shares
in the Indian companies are located in India and would accordingly attract
liability to income- tax as income received in India.
