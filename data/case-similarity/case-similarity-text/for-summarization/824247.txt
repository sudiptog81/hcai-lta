and not a letter of resignation. On receipt of the said information, the
petitioner company by a communication dated 29.03.2010 had terminated the
service of the petitioner and passed the following order:
"I refer to my letter dated 22nd March 2010 and the subsequent discussion
between yourself, Mr.Harimaran and me on 27th March 2010. As you still
maintain that you have not resigned, the company is hereby exercising its
option to terminate your services effective 29th March 2010 under clause 7 of
your employment letter dated 1st June 2009.
You will be paid 1 month's salary in lieu of notice period as contractually
stipulated and any other amounts that may be due to you. Kindly collect your
Full and Final settlement at a mutually convenient time along with your
personal effects."
32\. Therefore, it is too late in the day for the petitioner to contend that
there was no termination so as to enable the authority to entertain the
appeal. Under the aforesaid circumstances, both the writ petitions are
misconceived and bereft of any legal reasons. Hence, both the writ petitions

The petitioner has filed W.P.No.1217 of 2011, challenging an order of the
second respondent Appellate Authority under the Tamil Nadu Shops and
Establishments Act (for short TNSE Act),1947 in TSE-No.II/IA-1/2010 dated
28.10.2010. In the second writ petition, the prayer is for a writ in the
nature of prohibition, directing the second respondent from proceeding further
with the appeal filed under Section 41(2) of the TNSE Act.
2\. The facts leading to the filing of the two writ petitions were as
follows:-
The first respondent herein filed an appeal under Section 41(2) of the TNSE
Act, challenging an order of termination dated 29.03.2010 issued by the
petitioner and sought for setting aside the same with consequential direction
to reinstate him with continuity of service and other benefits. He also
further sought for payment of Rs.1,38,316/- which included salary for the
month of April, Bonus, LTC, Earned Leave etc. Since the appeal was filed with
a delay of 110 days, he had filed an application under proviso to Rule 9(2) of
the TNSE Rules, 1948 together with supporting affidavit.
3\. In the affidavit filed in support of the condone delay petition, the first
respondent had stated that since his aged parents were unwell and were taking
medical treatment including surgery, he had to attend his aged parents and
hence, he could not immediately file the appeal and prayed for the condonation
of delay. In the said application for condoning delay, notice was ordered to
the petitioner with Diary No.II/1A-1/2010.
4\. Instead of giving reply to the averments made in the affidavit filed in
support of the condone delay petition, the petitioner through its General
Manager filed an interim counter affidavit contending that the business run by
them was carrying on back office service falling under the definition of I.T.
Enabled Services. The provisions of I.T.Policy of State of Tamil Nadu will
apply to them. The State Government vide G.O.(D).No.338, Labour and Employment
Department, dated 24.05.2000 had exempted the software industries in Tamil
Nadu from the provisions of the TNSE Act. Likewise, by G.O.Ms.No.543,
Development dated 10.02.1950, the Government had exempted all persons employed
in any kind of work in factories and governed by Factories Act from all
provisions of the Act. The I.T.Policy of the State Government, 2002 exempted
application of the provisions of TNSE Act to I.T. Companies and I.T.Enabled
Companies. It was further stated that since the first respondent was employed
in a managerial capacity, he cannot invoke the provisions of the TNSE Act.
5\. The first respondent had filed a reply affidavit dated 07.10.2010 giving
reasons for the delay in filing the appeal.
6\. The second respondent Appellate Authority held that he did not want to go
into the jurisdictional issue but will strictly deal with the condonation
delay application. He found that there was sufficient cause which disabled the
first respondent from moving the authority. Therefore, after considering the
merits of the allegations made by the first respondent, he condoned the the
delay and directed the main appeal to be posted for further hearing on
17.11.2010. Challenging the order dated 28.10.2010 condoning the delay, the
first writ petition was filed.
7\. The second writ petition was filed to issue a writ in the nature of
prohibition to the second respondent from hearing the appeal. Since according
to the petitioner, he totally lacks jurisdiction to deal with the same.
8\. In both the writ petitions, notice was directed to be issued to the
respondents on 22.01.2011. Pending the notice, an interim stay was also
granted.
9\. On notice from this Court, the first respondent had filed a counter
affidavit dated 14.02.2011. This Court is not inclined to interfere with an
order passed to condone the delay in filing the appeal especially, when the
delay is only 110 days. The authority had exercised his discretion to condone
the delay. The petitioner cannot said to be put on any prejudice. The TNSE Act
provides for a remedy for an employee working in an establishment covered by
the Act to challenge an order of termination before the Appellate Authority
and it is a valuable right.
10\. In this context, it is necessary to refer to a judgment of the Supreme
Court in N. Balakrishnan v. M.Krishnamurthy reported in (1998) 7 SCC 123. In
paragraph 9 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court has held that the
condonation of delay is a matter of discretion of the Court. The Limitation
Act do not limit the discretion and the length of delay is not a matter to be
taken into account and acceptability of the explanation is the only criteria.
Once the Court accepts the explanation as sufficient, it is the result of
positive exercise of discretion. Normally, the superior court should not
disturb such findings. Therefore, this Court do not think that W.P.No.1217 of
2011 is a fit case to be entertained especially, when the authority had
rightly condoned the delay. It is for the petitioner to file appropriate
written statement on merits to contest the appeal filed by the first
respondent.
11\. However, Mr.S.R.Rajagopal, learned counsel for the petitioner strenuously
contended that since the second respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain
the appeal, the writ in the nature of prohibition is maintainable and this
Court must consider the objections raised by him regarding want of
jurisdiction on the part of the second respondent to entertain the Shops Act
appeal.
12\. Before dealing with the merits of the contentions raised by the learned
counsel for the petitioner, it is necessary to refer to two judgments of the
Supreme Court which limits the power of this Court to issue a writ in the
nature of prohibition.
13\. The Supreme Court in Isha Beevi v. Tax Recovery Officer reported in
(1976) 1 SCC 70 has held that in order to substantiate their right to obtain a
writ of prohibition from a High Court, the applicant has to demonstrate total
absence of jurisdiction to proceed on the part of the officer or authority
complaint against.
14\. Subsequently, the Supreme court in Thirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and
another v. Thallappaka Ananthacharyulu reported in (2003) 8 SCC 134 has held
that in the absence of very cogent or strong reasons, a writ in the nature of
prohibition cannot be issued and it will be an improper exercise. The very
court in which the case is pending itself has the power to decide its own
jurisdiction. Therefore, there is no reason why the petitioner cannot raise
the jurisdictional issue before the second respondent authority and invite
findings on those issues and if it is adverse to the petitioner, reserve their
rights to challenge after a final order is passed by the authority concerned.
15\. Mr.S.R.Rajagopal, learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the
second respondent Appellate Authority is a lay person and his position cannot
be equated to a Court. It is too much for them to deal with the issues raised.
His argument cannot be accepted as the second respondent has been given a
quasi judicial power and all the issues that are raised before him, he is
bound to answer. Even otherwise, if he has any doubt regarding the application
of TNSE Act, he can always raise this issue and invite authoritative findings
from the Commissioner of Labour in terms of Section 51 of the TNSE Act. But
notwithstanding these directions, the learned counsel for the petitioner
argued on the question of applicability of the Act to the petitioner company.
16\. It is necessary to extract the following stand of the first respondent as
set out in paragraph 4 of the counter affidavit:
"The petitioner is a Shared Service Centre (SSC) and is in charge of rendering
accounting and financial transactions processing services remotely (off-shore)
relating to businesses of the Parent company. Petitioner is a fully owned
subsidiary of the Parent Company and is a centralized accounting unit for the
businesses of the Parent Company. In other words it is a Captive BPO service
provider operating under the overall policy frame work and directions of the
Parent Company. By the nature of its business activities i.e. rendering data
processing/ back end accounting and financial transactions services relating
to commercial/ trading transactions of the Parent Company, the petitioner is
an 'Establishment' and an 'Employer' under Sections 2(6) and 2(5) respectively
of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishment Act, 1947."
17\. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the first
respondent was employed in the position of Management and therefore, he cannot
be a person employed within the meaning of Section 2(12) of the TNSE Act.
Since under Section 4(1)(a) of the TNSE Act, persons employed in any
establishment in a position of Management are exempted from the provisions of
the Act. However, this argument betrays the ignorance of the petitioner.
18\. Under Section 5 of the TNSE Act, the State Government has power to notify
even in respect of exempted person the provisions of Act. Pursuant to the
exercise of its power, the State Government had issued the following
notification as early as 05.10.1966. The notification reads as follows:-
Application of provisions of Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act to
certain class of persons.
[G.O.Ms.No.4074, Industries, Labour and Housing (Labour), 5th October, 1966]
II-I No.4489 of 1966 .--In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5 of
the Madras Shops and Establishments Act, 1947 (Madras Act XXXVI of 1947), the
Governor of Madras hereby applies all the provisions of the said Act to the
class of persons mentioned in clause (a) of Sub  section (1) of Section 4."
19\. In this context, it is necessary to refer to the the judgment of this
Court in Oriental Bank of Commerce, Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour, Madras
reported in [1982 (1) L.L.N.446], wherein a learned Judge of this Court
(S.Padmanabhan,J.); after considering S.4(1)(c) of the Shops Act and after
referring to a notification issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu pursuant to
the power conferred under S.5 of the Act, has made the following observation:
"...the provisions of the Act (Shops Act) are applicable to persons employed
in any shop in a position of management...
This was not disputed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. In these
circumstances, it must necessarily follow that the third respondents being a
person employed within the meaning of S.2(12) of the Act would be entitled to
maintain an appeal under S.41(2) of the (Shops) Act.".
20\. In L.Subbian v. Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Coimbatore reported in
[1993 (1) L.L.N.875], Srinivasan,J. (as he then was) has held that, in Para 4,
at page 876 as follows:
"...Section 4(1)(a) of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Act provides
that nothing contained in the Act shall apply only to the persons employed in
any establishment in a position of management. But S.5 thereof empowers the
Government to issue a notification applying all or any of the provisions of
the Act to any class of persons or establishments mentioned in S.4 of the Act,
other than those mentioned in Cls.(c) and (f) of Sub-sec (1). Thus, with
regard to S.4(1)(a) of the Act, the Government is entitled to issue a
notification to the effect that the Act will apply to persons covered by the
said sub-section. The Government has issued a notification G.O.Ms.No.4074,
Industries Labour and Housing (Labour), dated 5 October 1966, by exercising
the powers conferred under S.5 of the Act, applying all the provisions of the
Act to the clause of persons mentioned in Cl(a) of Sub-sec (I) of S.4. Thus,
the Act applied to all persons who are employed in any establishment in a
position of management. Hence, the Act will apply to the petitioner also,
though he is employed as a supervisor, in a position of management. Hence, the
first respondent is clearly wrong in dismissing the appeal of the petitioner
on that ground."
21\. Subsequently, in Management of Madras Atomic Power Project Employees
Consumers Co-operative Stores, Ltd., Kalpakkam (represented by its Special
Officer) v.Deputy Commissioner of Labour,Madras and another reported in
2000(3) L.L.N.1007, P.Sathasivam, J. (as he then was) in paragraph 7 held as
follow:-
"7. ...As per S.4(1)(a), a person employed in any establishment in a position
of management cannot seek assistance under the provisions of the Shops Act.
However, the State Government is competent to include any establishment within
the purview of the Shops Act by way of notification in the Gazette. Even as
early as on 5 October 1966 the Government have issued a notification stating
that all the provisions of the Shops Act apply to the class of persons
mentioned in Cl.(a) of Sub-sec(1) of S.4 of the Act. ...It is not clear that
even persons employed in the position of management are also covered by the
provisions of the Shops Act."
22\. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner that the first respondent
being employed in the position of Management and therefore, exempted from the
purview of the Act cannot be countenanced by this Court.
23\. The other contention that the factories coming within the definition of
Section 2(n) of the Factories Act, 1948 are exempted from the purview of the
Shops Act is concerned, it is necessary to refer the said notification which
is as follows:-
"Grant of exemption to Software Industries in Tamil Nadu [G.O.(Ms.)No.316,
Labour and Employment (C), 24th December, 2004] No.II(2)/LE/1102(b)/2004 In
exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 of the Tamil Nadu Shops and
Establishments Act, 1947 (Tamil Nadu Act XXXVI of 1947) and in supersession of
the Labour and Employment notification No.II(2)/LE/ 550/2000 dated the 24th
April, 2000, published at page 261 of Part II  Sec.2 of the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette dated the 24th May, 2000, the Governor of Tamil Nadu hereby
exempts the Software Industries in Tamil Nadu from the provisions of Chapters
II and III of the said Act from the date of publication of this Notification
in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, subject to the following conditions:-
(1) The exemption shall be cancelled, if any genuine complaints are received
from the employees.
(2) The name board of the establishments shall be exhibited in Tamil in the
manner prescribed in rule 15 of the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishments Rules,
1948."
24\. As can be seen from the above notification, software industries were
exempted only from the application of Chapters II and III dealing with opening
and closing hours, daily and weekly hours spread over on holidays. In so far
as the provision relating to appeal under Section 41(2) of the TNSE Act is
provided under Chapter VII, which has not been exempted in respect of those
industries. The very fact that the State Government has exempted only Chapter
II and III of the TNSE Act, it goes without saying that other provisions will
automatically apply to the software industries. Even the earlier notification
G.O.(D).No.338 Labour and Employment, Department dated 24.04.2000 had only
exempted Chapter II of the TNSE Act. In respect of the software industries by
the new notification, Chapter III has been added for the grant of exemption.
25\. Even if it is the case of the petitioners that their factory comes within
the meaning of the Factories Act so as to enable an exemption in terms of the
notification in G.O.Ms.No.543, Development dated 10.02.1950, the said issue is
no longer res integra.
26\. It must be noted that the Factories Act itself had undergone an amendment
by Central Act 20 of 1987. The definition of the term 'Factory" as found in
Section 2(m) of the Factories Act, though comprehensive to include all
manufacturing process carried on in an establishment with or without power,
the Explanation II added to the said Act by the amendment with effect from
01.12.1987 exempts Electricity Data Processing Unit from the purview of the
Act.
27\. Explanation II reads as follows:-
"For the purposes of this clause the mere fact that an Electronic Data
Processing Unit or a computer Unit is installed in any premises or part
thereof shall not be construed to make it a factory if no manufacturing
process is being carried on in such premises or part thereof".
28\. A similar question came up before this court with reference to the
application of Chapter V-B of the I.D.Act in relation to a software company,
while the definition under Section 25-L of the I.D.Act defined Industrial
Establishment so as to have Chapter V-B applicable to the establishment
included factory as defined under Section 2(m) of the Factories Act. But
however, after relying upon Explanation II extracted above, the Division Bench
of this Court vide judgment in Seelan Raj, R. and 14 others v. The Presiding
Officer, I Additional Labour Court and 3 others reported in 1997 (II) CTC 317,
noted that the Factories Act are not applicable to the Software companies.
Therefore, even assuming without admitting that the petitioner establishment
can come within the definition of the term 'Factory' since software companies
are exempted from the term 'Factory' and not governed by the provisions of the
Factories Act, the application of G.O.Ms.No.543, Development dated 10.02.1950
also does not arise.
29\. The petitioner thereafter made a feeble attempt to refer to the so called
I.T.Policy of Tamil Nadu made in G.O.Ms.N.15 Information Technology
Department, dated 22.05.2003 and G.O.Ms.No.18 Information Technology
Department, dated 05.11.2004 and G.O.Ms.No.11 Information Technology
Department, dated 25.10.2005 for contending that the State Government has
exempted application of TNSE Act to the I.T.industry.
30\. A perusal of the three Government Orders found enclosed in the second
typed set filed by the petitioner shows there was no such policy evolved by
the State Government. On the other hand, all the three Government Orders has
merely stated that it referred only to the earlier exemption given by the
State Government exempting the software companies from the application of
Chapters II and III of the TNSE Act as well as the Self-Certification method
in declaring that they are maintaining all the statutory forms prescribed
under the Act.
31\. Lastly, the learned counsel made a desperate contention that the
petitioner was not terminated from service. He had sent an email on 01.03.2010
resigning from service and therefore, it would not amount to termination by
the company. On the other hand, the petitioner sent a representation dated
23.03.2010 stating that his email dated 01.03.2010 was only an offer to resign
and not a letter of resignation. On receipt of the said information, the
petitioner company by a communication dated 29.03.2010 had terminated the
service of the petitioner and passed the following order:
"I refer to my letter dated 22nd March 2010 and the subsequent discussion
between yourself, Mr.Harimaran and me on 27th March 2010. As you still
maintain that you have not resigned, the company is hereby exercising its
option to terminate your services effective 29th March 2010 under clause 7 of
your employment letter dated 1st June 2009.
You will be paid 1 month's salary in lieu of notice period as contractually
stipulated and any other amounts that may be due to you. Kindly collect your
Full and Final settlement at a mutually convenient time along with your
personal effects."
32\. Therefore, it is too late in the day for the petitioner to contend that
there was no termination so as to enable the authority to entertain the
appeal. Under the aforesaid circumstances, both the writ petitions are
misconceived and bereft of any legal reasons. Hence, both the writ petitions
will stand dismissed with a cost of Rs.10,000/- payable to the counsel for the
first respondent. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.

nature of prohibition, directing the second respondent from proceeding further
with the appeal filed under Section 41(2) of the TNSE Act.
2\. The facts leading to the filing of the two writ petitions were as
follows:-
The first respondent herein filed an appeal under Section 41(2) of the TNSE
Act, challenging an order of termination dated 29.03.2010 issued by the
petitioner and sought for setting aside the same with consequential direction
to reinstate him with continuity of service and other benefits. He also
further sought for payment of Rs.1,38,316/- which included salary for the
month of April, Bonus, LTC, Earned Leave etc. Since the appeal was filed with
and not a letter of resignation. On receipt of the said information, the
petitioner company by a communication dated 29.03.2010 had terminated the
service of the petitioner and passed the following order:
"I refer to my letter dated 22nd March 2010 and the subsequent discussion
between yourself, Mr.Harimaran and me on 27th March 2010. As you still
maintain that you have not resigned, the company is hereby exercising its
option to terminate your services effective 29th March 2010 under clause 7 of
your employment letter dated 1st June 2009.
You will be paid 1 month's salary in lieu of notice period as contractually
stipulated and any other amounts that may be due to you. Kindly collect your
Full and Final settlement at a mutually convenient time along with your
personal effects."
32\. Therefore, it is too late in the day for the petitioner to contend that
there was no termination so as to enable the authority to entertain the
appeal. Under the aforesaid circumstances, both the writ petitions are
misconceived and bereft of any legal reasons. Hence, both the writ petitions
