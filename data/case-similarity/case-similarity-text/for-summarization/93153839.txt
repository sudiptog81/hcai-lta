                                         ORDER
PER SHRI PAVAN KUMAR GADALE, JM :
The assessee has filed an appeal against the order passed under Section 143(3)
r.w.s. 144C(13) of Income Tax Act, 1961 in pursuance to the Directions of
Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) Order Dt.13.11.2015.
2\. The learned Authorised Representative at the time of hearing filed revised
and modified grounds of appeal and submitted that Ground Nos.1 & 2 are general
2 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 in nature and is not pressing Ground Nos.3, 7, 8 &
9 and made endorsement. Whereas the Ground No.12 is consequential and the
effective grounds of appeal are Ground Nos.4, 5, 6, 10 & 11 which are
mentioned hereunder :-
3\. The Brief facts of the case are that the assessee is engaged in the
business of medical transcription and is a subsidiary of Acusis Holding Co.
Ltd. British Virgin Islands which is a wholly subsidiary of Acusis LLC, USA
and the company registered as a private company engaged in medical
transcription services to Acusis LLC and is remunerated on cost + 15% mark up.
The assessee filed Return of Income for the Assessment Year 2011-12 with
income at NIL after claiming  3 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 deduction under
Section 10A of the Act of Rs.88,25,084. Subsequently, the case was selected
for scrutiny and a Notice under Section 143(2) and 142(1) were issued. The
Assessing Officer on perusal of the financial statements found that the
assessee has claimed deduction under Section 10A whereas the Assessing Officer
found that the claim is excessive and restricted the claim of Rs.3,81,78,684.
Since the assessee company has international transactions, the matter was
referred to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) with prior approval of the
Commissioner of Income Tax and the TPO dealt on the financial profile of the
assessee with operating profit on operating cost at para 3 as under :
                     Operating Revenues              25,93,15,082/-
                     Operating Expenses              22,23,59,708/-
                     Operating (Profit) / Loss       3,69,55,374/-
                     Op. Profit on cost %               16.61%
The assessee has international transactions of providing medical transcription
of Rs.25,93,15,082. The assessee has submitted the documents required under
Rule 92D along with actual reports and copies whereas the assessee has
selected 14 comparables in respect of IT Enabled Services and TNMM is
considered as Most Appropriate Method (MAM) whereas the TPO has rejected the
TP Study and applied filter and finally selected comparables and rejected
assessee's comparables at page 7 para 6 as under :
4
IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 The TPO discussed the analysis of comparables
selected in pages 8 to 14 and finally dealt on the economics and computed
Arm's Length Price (ALP) at  5 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 Rs.2,73,57,054.
Further, the Draft assessment order was passed on 16.2.2015 under Section
143(3) r.w.s. 92CA of the Act determined the total income after ALP at
Rs.2,79,97,454 against the draft assessment order, the assessee filed
objections with the DRP, whereas the DRP after considering the submissions of
the assessee, has granted relief in respect of comparables and final
assessment order was passed. Aggrieved by the order, the assessee has filed an
appeal with the Tribunal.
4\. At the time of hearing, the learned Authorised Representative submitted
the chart in respect of exclusion of the comparables i.e. Accentia
Technologies Ltd. and ICRA Online Ltd., since the DRP has confirmed the action
of the TPO. The ld. AR submitted that 6 comparables are to be included and
relied on the judicial decisions of EMC Software and Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. and
Finastra Software Solutions for the same Assessment Year 2011-12. Similarly,
the learned Authorised Representative prayed for inclusion of comparables of
E4E Healthcare Business Services Pvt. Ltd., Cosmic Global Limited, Informed
Technologies India Limited, Microgenetic Systems Ltd., Calibre Point Business
Solutions Limited and R. Systems International Limited. The contention of ld.
AR on the issue of inclusion of comparables covered in assessee's own case
where 6 comparables are included for the Assessment Years 2009-10, 2010-11 and
2012-13 and supported with the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High  6 IT(TP)A
No.169/Bang/2016 Court. On the other issues with respect to Working Capital
Adjustment and Foreign Exchange fluctuation, the assessee could not able to
submit the details and prayed for restoring to the file of TPO and ld. DR
supported the orders of lower authorities.
5\. We heard the rival contentions and perused the material on record. On the
first disputed issue on the exclusion of two comparables, the learned
Authorised Representative filed chart. We find -
(i) Accentia Technologies Ltd. turn over is Rs.106.90 Crores and the
functioning of the company is engaged in packaging its services into software
productions that are developed in-house with no bifurcations. The company also
invested in the development of EMR Software and SaaS Model, and marketed inUSA
retaining of the workforce across all its delivery centres. The company in the
previous year expansion by acquiring stake in Strategic Tangent Corporation
and Alpine Technologies Inc having expertise in software development and
Remodel Business Plan with the adoption of EMR based clinical practice and has
opened up avenues for an integrated end-to-end SaaS model and also involved in
product development of a wide range like Insta Kare, Insta PMS, Insta EMR, etc
further software with host of other BPO services provides a competitive edge
solely on medical transcription services and Segment Information of the
company is reported only on one segment namely "Healthcare  7 IT(TP)A
No.169/Bang/2016 receivable Management", but whereas the company is also
working on other segments such as SaaS, Product Development etc and there is
no proper disclosure. Further the company considers its services are in the
nature of KPO rather than BPO Services and Intangibles in the nature of
goodwills, Brands and IPRs which constitute 46.68% of the total value of fixed
assets excluding capital work in progress and the company recognizes the
revenue on completion of services, the assessee follows mercantile system of
accounting and relied on co-ordinate Bench decision in IT(TP)A
No.273/Bang/2016 for Asst. Year 2011-12 Dt.25.4.2018 in the case of EMS
Software Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. at page13 at paras 29 to 31 as under :
" 29. As far as the cross-objection of the Assessee is concerned, in ground
1.6 the assessee has sought exclusion of Accentia Technology Ltd., from the
final list of comparables, after the order of the DRP. The ground on which the
assessee seeks exclusion of this company is that this company is engaged in
providing high end services in the nature of knowledge processing out
sourcing. According to the Assessee it was engaged in back office services
which are only supportive and cannot be compared with services performed by
Accentia Technology Ltd. Besides the above, this company is also stated to
have income from coding which is substantial. The ld counsel for the assessee
placed reliance on the decision of the ITAT Bangalore Bench in the case of M/s
Swiss Re Shared Services India Pvt. Ltd., Vs. ACIT in IT(TP)A No.380/Bang/2016
order dated 8/7/2016 for assessment year 2011-12. Our attention was drawn to
the order of the paras 9 to 20 of the order of the Tribunal, wherein the
Tribunal has considered comparability of this company in the ITES segment and
has held as follows:-
09\. Adverting to Accentia Technologies Ltd, Ld. AR submitted that the said
company had inorganic growth during the relevant previous year due to creation
of a US based localised front-end company. As per the Ld. AR, Accentia
Technologies Ltd, was doing outsourcing work as well as coding. Coding work
fell within the realm of software development only. According to the Ld. AR,
medical transcription earnings of Accentia Technologies Ltd, comprised of
preparation of customised notes of patients, record keeping of patients,
insurance verification of patients, appointment scheduling of patients,
providing accessible practice management system, providing EMR systems
including EMR coding, billing, bill payment management system, adhoc reporting
etc., As per the Ld.AR, said company catered to the health care industry and
their products were customised and not similar to what assessee was doing. As
per the Ld. AR the work done by Accentia Technologies Ltd, required skilled
knowledge and advanced analytics. Ld. AR submitted that during the relevant
previous year, the said company had invested in  8 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
another company which had an expertise in EMR Software and Saas. In any case,
as per the Ld. AR, segmental results of Accentia was not available in between
various segments like MT billing collection and coding. When segmental results
were not available, as per the Ld. AR it was not proper to consider Accentia
Technologies Ltd, as a good comparable. Reliance was also placed on decision
of Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Equant Solutions India P. Ltd v.
DCIT [ITA.1202/Del/2015, dt.21.01.2016] and that of coordinate bench in the
case of Amba Research (India) P. Ltd, v. DCIT [IT(TP)A.286/Bang/2015,
dt.09.03.2016]. As per the Ld. AR though the above decisions were for A. Y.
2010-11, Accentia Technologies Ltd, was doing the very same activities during
the relevant previous year also. Hence according to him these decisions could
be taken as a precedence for excluding the said company from the list of
comparables.
10\. Per contra, Ld. DR submitted that 80% of the revenue of Accentia
Technologies Ltd, were from medical transcription, which fell within ITES
only. As per the Ld. DR, actual activities of the assessee compared favourable
with Accentia Technologies Ltd. When 80% of the income was from ITES services,
as per the Ld. DR further segmentation was not required. As for the reliance
placed on the decisions of Delhi Bench in the case of Equant Solutions India
P. Ltd, (supra) and coordinate bench in the case of Amba Research India P. Ltd
(supra), Ld. DR submitted that these were for A. Y. 2010-11 and there was a
clear finding by the Tribunal that results of Accentia Technologies Ltd, were
skewed because of acquisition of a business during that year and also due to
inorganic growth.
11\. In reply Ld. AR submitted that even within the same ITES segment
differentiation could be made based on high-end and lowend services. Relying
on judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions P.
Ltd v. CIT [ITA.102/2015, dt.10.08.2015], Ld. AR submitted that there could be
high-end and low-end services which may not be comparable. As per Ld. AR in
the case of assessee, it was doing low-end BPO services in the field of
insurance and could not be compared with a high-end service provider in the
medical field.
12\. We have perused the orders and heard the rival contentions. Twentieth
annual report of Acentia Technologies Ltd, for financial year 2010-11 has been
filed at paper book page 491 to 568. In the part captioned 'Management
discussion and Analysis', the company mentioned its medical transcription
business being moved from a low-end category to a high-end category.
Management of the said company had decided to acquire necessary skills
inorganically so that it could do medical coding and provide end to end
services in HRCM. In what is called by the said company as EMR method, it
captured and stored all demographic and clinical data in data base format
rather than keeping physical reports as done in orthodox medical transcription
methods. That M/s. Accentia Technologies Ltd, was providing integrated end to
end software services and remodelling its own business is clear from page 25
of its annual report which is reproduced hereunder :
13\. Type of work done by the said company has been explained in detail at
pages 24 and 25 of annual report. This is reproduced hereunder :
9
IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
17\. Thus the functions which were done by Accentia Technologies Ltd, and the
functions which were rendered by the assessee were entirely different. We
cannot say that the type of services done by the assessee was of a level as
sophisticated as the one which was being provided by Accentia Technologies
Ltd. In the case of Rampgreen Solutions P. Ltd (supra), Hon'ble Delhi High
Court mentioned as under at para 31 of its order, which reads as under :
31\. In the present case, the Tribunal noted that Vishal and eClerx were both
engaged in rendering ITeS. The Tribunal held that, "once a service falls under
the category of ITeS, then there is no sub-classification of segment". Thus,
according to the Tribunal, no differentiation could be made between the
entities rendering ITeS. We find it difficult to accept this view as it is
contrary to the ftc1amentat rationale of determining ALP by comparing
controlled transactions/entities with similar uncontrolled
transactions/entities. ITeS encompasses a wide spectrum of services that use
Information Technology based delivery. Such services could include rendering
highly technical services by qualified technical personnel. involving advanced
skills and knowledge, such as engineering, design and support. While, on the
other end of the spectrum ITeS would also include voice-based call centers
that render routine customer support for their clients. Clearly,
characteristics of the service rendered would be dissimilar. Further, both
service providers cannot be considered to be functionally similar. Their
business environment would be entirely different, the demand and supply for
the services would be different, the assets and capital employed would differ,
the competence required to operate the two services would be different. Each
of the aforesaid factors would have a material bearing on the profitability of
the two entities. Treating the said entities to be comparables only for the
reason that they use Information Technology for the delivery of their
services, would, in our opinion, be erroneous.
18\. Thus when characteristics of services rendered were dissimilar and the
competence required to operate the services were different, it will not be
correct to compare the results of two companies.
19\. In the case of Amba Research India P. Ltd (supra), this Tribunal had
directed exclusion of Accentia Technologies Ltd, for comparison purposes.
Assessee in the said case was providing ITES services to its holding company
at British Virgin Islands. Observation of the Tribunal at para 8 of the order
dt.09.03.2016, is reproduced hereunder :
08\. We have perused the orders and heard the rival contentions. No doubt
Accentia Technologies Ltd, formed a part of the list of comparables considered
by the assessee in its TP study. However assessee had objected to its
inclusion citing functional dissimilarity before the AO as well as the DRP.
Question regarding comparability of Accentia Technologies in the ITE segment
for A. Y. 2010-11 had come up before this Tribunal in the case of Novo Nordisk
India P. Ltd (supra). It was held as under at paras 31 and 32 of the order
dt.30.07.2015 :
31\. We deal with the comparable companies which the Assessee seeks exclusion.
1. Accentia Technology Ltd., 2. Infosys BPO Ltd. The comparability of these
company with a ITES company was considered by this Tribunal in the case of
Paraxel International (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and the Tribunal held as
follows on the comparability of the aforesaid companies with a company
providing ITES in the following manner:-
"10. In grounds No.4 to 6, the assessee has challenged the comparables
selected by the TPO for the purpose of TP analysis and as submitted by the
learned counsel or the assessee, the assessee is  10 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
objecting to the selection of only the following five comparables, out of the
twelve companies selected as comparables -
Sl. No. Company Name
1\. Accentia Technologies Limited Technology
2\. Cosmic Global Ltd.
3\. Eclerx Services Ltd.
4\. Genesys International Ltd.
5\. Infosys B P O Ltd.
11\. We have heard the arguments of both the sides on the issue of
inclusion/exclusion of the above five companies as comparables and also
perused the relevant material on record including the various decisions of the
coordinate benches of the Tribunal cited by the learned counsel for the
assessee.
Accentia Technologies Limited
12\. As regards the selection of Accentia Technologies Limited as comparable,
the learned counsel for the assessee has relied on the decisions of this
Tribunal in the cases of Capital IQ Information Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. V/s.
Addl./Dy. Commissioner of Income-tax, Circle 1(2), Hyderabad and vice versa
(ITA No.124 and 170/Hyd/2014 dated 31.7.2014); Excellence Data Research Pvt.
Ltd., Hyderabad V/s. ITO Ward 2(1), Hyderabad (ITA No.159/Hyd/2014 dated
31.7.2014); and Hyundai Motors India Engineering P. Ltd., Hyderabad V/s. DCIT,
Circle 2(2), Hyderabad (ITA NHo.255/Hyd/2014 dated 31.7.2014), wherein M/s.
Accentia Technologies Limited(Seg) was excluded by the Tribunal from the list
of comparables on the ground that it was a case of mergers and acquisition,
and the company was also found to be functionally different. The relevant
observations of the Tribunal as recorded in para 19.2 of the order passed in
the case of Excellence Data Research Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad (supra), being
relevant in this case, are reproduced below- "19.2 We have considered the
rival contentions and noticed that this company operates in a different
business strategy of acquiring companies for inorganic growth as its strategy.
In earlier years on the reason of acquisition of various companies, being an
extraordinary event which had an impact on the profit, this company was
excluded. As submitted by the learned counsel, this year also, the acquisition
of some companies by that company may have impact on the profit. Considering
the profit margins of the company and insufficient segmental data, we are of
IT(TP)A No.146/Bang/2015 Page 42 of 52 the opinion that this company cannot be
selected as a comparable. Moreover, this is also not a comparable in the case
of M/s. Mercer Consulting (India) P. Ltd. (supra), which indicates that the
TPO therein has excluded it at the outset. In view of this, we direct the
Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude this comparable, from the list of comparables
selected."
13\. As pointed out by the learned counsel for the assessee, there was
acquisition of a company by M/s. Accentia Technologies Limited during the
relevant year, and the said company, therefore, cannot be considered as
comparable due to this extraordinary event which occurred in the relevant year
as rightly held by the Tribunal inter alia in the case of Excellence Data
Research P. Ltd. (supra). Although the learned Departmental Representative has
sought to contend that the acquisition of a company by M/s. Accentia
Technologies Ltd. took place at the fag end of the year under consideration,
the learned counsel for the assessee has pointed out that the process of
acquisition had started on 15.5.2008 itself, i.e. in the earlier part of the
year under consideration. We,  11 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 therefore, follow
the decision of the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of
Excellence Data Research Services Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and direct the AO/TPO to
exclude the Accentia Technologies Limited from the list of comparables.
........
Infosys BPO
20\. As regards selection of Infosys BPO as a comparable company, the learned
counsel for the assessee has contended that the said company cannot be taken
as comparable because of its uncomparable size of operations. He has contended
that the turnover of the said company was many times higher than that of the
assessee during the year under consideration. Although the Learned
Departmental Representative has contended that the size of operations does not
matter as far as selection of comparables is concerned especially in the
sector of IT Enabled services, it is observed that similar issue has been
decided by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT V/s. Agnity
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (219 Taxman 26) holding that huge turnover companies
like Infosys and Wipro cannot be considered as comparables with smaller
companies like the assessee in the present case. Respectfully following the
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Agnity Technologies P.
Ltd. (supra), we direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude Infosys BPO from
the list of comparables."
32\. As far as Accentia Technology Ltd., is concerned, even during the
previous year relevant to AY 2010-11, there was amalgamation of Ascent
Infoserve Private Limited with Accentia Technology Ltd., and consequent
thereto the assets and liabilities and accumulated reserves and the financial
results for the year ended 31st March, 2010, of the amalgamating company were
incorporated in the amgalamated company. As far as Infosys BPO Ltd., is
concerned, the observations made by the Tribunal in the decision referred in
the earlier paragraph will hold good for the present AY 2010-11 also.
Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal referred to above, we
direct that the aforesaid 2 companies be excluded from the list of comparable
companies for the purpose of computing arithmetic mean for comparability
purpose. The TPO is directed to give effect accordingly.
Even after exclusion of Accentia Technologies Ltd, along with the exclusion of
four comparable companies directed by DRP, there will be four companies left
in the list of comparables which, in our opinion, cannot be considered as too
small a sample for an effective TP study. In the circumstances, we direct
exclusion of Accentia Technologies Ltd also from the list of comparables.
Ordered accordingly.
20\. No doubt the said decision was for A. Y. 2010-11, but the conditions
which prevailed in the said previous year more or less existed in the impugned
assessment year also. Considering all these aspects, we are therefore of the
opinion that Accentia Technologies Ltd, was not a good comparable for the
purpose of ALP study of the assessee.
30\. The learned DR brought to our notice the decision of the DRP at Para-25
of its order on the comparability of this company. He brought to our notice
that this company was found comparable in ITES segment with the Assessee in
Assessee's own case for AY 2007-08 in IT (TP) A.No.973/Bang/2010. The learned
DR submitted that the functional profile of this company and the Assessee was
held to be same by the Tribunal in the aforesaid decision.  12
IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
31\. We have given a careful consideration to the rival submission. It is true
that the Tribunal found this company to be comparable with the Assessee in AY
2007-08. But the decision of the Tribunal referred to by the learned DR in the
case of Swiss Re Shared Services (supra) relates to AY 2010-11. The tribunal
has given elaborate reasons for exclusion of this company as a comparable
company and concluded at Paragraph 17 of its order that this company was not
comparable with a low end or mid end service provider in ITES as it was in
high end service provider in ITES. In view of the above decision of the
Tribunal, we are of the view that Accentia Technology Ltd., should be excluded
from the final list of comparable companies. The AO is directed to compute the
ALP after excluding Accentia Technology Ltd., from the list of comparables
that remains after the order of the DRP."
(ii) Icra Online Limited : The company is having turnover of Rs.15.67 Crores
and has three business segments namely, Information Services, Software
Services and Outsourced Services and the TPO has considered the 'Outsourced
Services' segment as comparable. Further the Annual Report of the company does
not provide any description as to the nature of the services contained in the
segment and the outsourcing segment of the company contains KPO services.
Further functionally different as the company is engaged in provision of high
end KPO services. Further margin error occurred due to the unallocated
depreciation amount which was not considered by the learned TPO and relied on
decision of Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in ITA No.1821/Mum/2016 for Asst.
Year 2011-12 Dt.3.5.2019 at page 10 paras 5.1 to 5.4 as under :
" 5.1 The TPO included ICRA Online Ltd. (Seg) (in short 'ICRA')on the ground
that it is engaged in data processing and data mining and accordingly it is
providing similar services (ITeS). The DRP upholds the order of the TPO, which
is followed by the AO.
5.2 The Ld. counsels of the assessee submit that as per the annual report, the
company has following three business segments:
(i) Information Services,
(ii) Software Services and
(iii) Outsource Services  13 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 It is further stated
that the TPO has considered the operations of the 'Outsourced Services'
segment as comparable to the operations of the appellant. The Ld. counsels
argue that the annual report of the company does not provide any description
as to the nature of the services contained in the segment. However, a
reference may be drawn to the annual report of ICRA Ltd., the holding company
of ICRA from where it can be seen that the outsourced segment of the company
relates to KPO and online software services.
The Ld. counsels further submit that the ITAT in appellant's own case for AY
2010-11 has followed the Tribunal discussion in the case of Tesco Hindustan
Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT (ITA No. 191/Bang/2015) to reject the company
functionally not comparable to the appellant i.e. companies not engaged in
providing ITeS (BPO Services). In this regard, reliance is placed by them on
the following orders of the Tribunal :
(i) M/s Sitel Operating Corporation India Pvt. Ltd. (since amalgamated with
Sitel India Pvt. Ltd.) v. ITO (ITA No. 598/Bang/2015 & ITA No. 452/Bang/2015)
dated 25 April 2018 [AY 2010-11]
(ii) M/s Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT(IT(TP)A No.
191/Bang/2015) dated 25 January 2017 [AY 2010-11]
(iii) Outsource Partners International v. DCIT (IT(TP)A No. 337/Bang/2015) [AY
2010-11]. 5.3 On the other hand, the Ld. DR submits that ICRA is engaged in
data processing and data mining and accordingly it is engaged in providing
similar services (ITeS). Thus it is stated that the inclusion of the above
company by the TPO/AO in the list of final comparables be confirmed. 5.4 We
have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant materials on record.
The reasons for our decisions are given below.
The TPO has considered the operations of the 'Outsourced Services' segment of
ICRA as comparable to the operations of the appellant. However, we find that
the annual report of the company does not provide any description as to the
nature of the services contained in this segment. As per page 532 of the P/B,
a reference may be made to the annual report of ICRA Ltd., the holding company
of ICRA from where it can be seen that the outsourced segment of the company
relates to KPO and online software services. Also page 8 of the annual report
of ICRA Ltd. delineates the business of ICRA stating that the company is
engaged in providing KPO and online software services. As per the description
at page 532 of the P/B, the knowledge process outsourcing division provides
financial and analytical services and support to clients in the area of data
extraction, aggregation, electronic conversion of financial statements,
validation and analysis, accounting and finance, research and analytics. Thus
the appellant in the instant case performs routine ITeS comprising of
contact/call centre services and hence is a routine BPO service provider and
cannot be compared to a company providing KPO services such as ICRA.
Also we find that the TPO has wrongly computed the margin of the company as
33.54% instead of the correct margin 22.32%, because the TPO has excluded
foreign exchange income and other receipts  14 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
(allocated basis revenue in each segment), whereas, the same is to be added
for information service, outsource service and software service to arrive at
the correct margin. In assessee's own case for AY 2010-11, the ITAT 'A' Bench
Bangalore has followed the Tribunal discussion in the case of Tesco Hindustan
Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to reject the companies functionally not
comparable to the appellant i.e. companies not engaged in providing ITeS (BPO)
service. In the case of Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd. (supra), ICRA
has been held to be non- comparable to an ITeS service provider.
Accordingly, following the decision of Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) and the observations in the Tribunal decision in appellant's own
case for AY 2010-11, we reject ICRA Online as a comparable."
Considering the decision of EMC Software and Services (India) Pvt. Ltd.
discussed the Accenture Technologies Ltd. cannot be considered as comparable
with assessee company in ITES. We direct the TPO to exclude the comparable for
determining ALP. Similarly ICRA Online Limited is directed to be excluded for
determining ALP based on the decision of Tribunal in Sitel India Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
DCIT (supra).
6\. On the second issue of inclusion of comparables, the ld. AR submitted that
6 companies are to be included which are as under :-
(i) E4E Healthcare Business Services Pvt. Ltd. turnover is Rs.61.32 Crores and
is engaged in providing healthcare outsourcing services. The TPO had retained
the company as a comparable and the appellant has not raised any objections
against the same before TPO or DRP. The DRP suo moto rejected this comparable
due to inconsistency in accounting of Bad debts and provision for bad debts
debited to the P&L and does not represent inconsistency in overall accounting
policies. Further loss due to bad debts can only be reasonably  15 IT(TP)A
No.169/Bang/2016 estimated, however it could occur due to various unexpected
factors leading to difference in quantum of write off/provisions. This is
neither a qualitative filter nor a functional criterion in order to reject a
comparable which is functionally comparable to the appellant and TPO has
considered in assessee's own case for Asst. Year 2012-13 at Page 15 para 8.5
as under :
(ii) Cosmic Global Limited is having turnover of Rs.6.25 Crores and
functionally comparable as the company earns revenue from medical
transcription, translation and BPO services. The TPO had retained the company
as a comparable and the assessee had not raised any objections against the
same before TPO or  16 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 DRP. But the DRP suo moto
rejected the comparable by assuming translation charges to be in the nature of
outsourcing charges. However, this accounts only 44% of cost indicating that
the company is not purely operating on the alleged outsourcing model and also
employee cost is 39% of total cost and transactions are not outsourced and was
included by the TPO in assessee's own case for Asst. Year 2009-10 & 2010-11 at
TPO order pages 14 & 15 para 10 as under :
17
IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016
(iii) Informed Technologies India Limited is having turnover of Rs.1.75 Crores
and functionally comparable as the company is engaged in rendering BPO
services. But the TPO and the DRP had rejected the company stating that rental
income is more than the operating income. The TPO has not given finding or
instances of functional dissimilarity and the TPO has no reservations. Rental
income is non-operating in nature and the mere fact of the non-operating
income being higher than the operating income does not render the company as
non- comparable and it is forming a part of the final set of comparables
conducted by the learned TPO in assessee's own case in AY 2009-10, 2010-11 and
2012-13 and TPO Chart referred above for Asst. Year 2012-13.
(iv) Microgenetic Systems Limited is having turnover of Rs.1.28 Crores and
functionally comparable as the company is involved in the provision of Medical
18 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 transcription charges. Whereas the TPO rejected
the company due to non- availability of data in the public database and also
the DRP rejected the company stating that expense to the extent of 23% of
total cost has been incurred in outsourcing of the medical transcription
activity. Further the company has significant employee costs. This indicates
that the company is not purely in outsourcing model and operate primarily
through its own employees. The TPO has not cited any instances of functional
dissimilarity and the DRP has made assumptions regarding the total expenses,
without giving regards to the assessee's contentions on functional
comparability and was conducted by TPO as comparable to the Asst. Year
2012-13. TPO order for Asst. Year 2012-13 referred above.
(iv) Caliber Point Business Solutions Limited is having turnover of Rs.79.07
Crores and functionally comparable and is engaged in comparable services and
has segmental information. The TPO and the DRP rejected this company on the
basis of different financial year ending. Though the company had different
financial year ending, it was operating during the said period and
(v) R Systems International Limited is having turnover of Rs.20.21 Crores. And
functionally comparable and is engaged in comparable activities of BPO
services and has segmental information. The TPO and the DRP rejected this
company on the basis of different financial year ending. The company even
though having different financial year ending, were operating during the same
19 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 period of time. The learned counsel for the
assessee supported with judicial decision and we find DRP has dealt at page 5
para 6 (a) as under :
And similarly R. Systems International Ltd., DRP dealt at page 7 para 6(e) as
under :
20
IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 We considering the directions and order of DRP and
TPO, we are not inclined to include above two comparables and dismiss the
assessee's ground of appeal. Accordingly, we direct the A.O/TPO to include
aforesaid 4 companies i.e. (1) E4E Healthcare Business Services Pvt. Ltd. (2)
Cosmic Global Limited (3) Informed  21 IT(TP)A No.169/Bang/2016 Technologies
India Ltd. and (4) Microgenetic Systems Limited in the list of comparables for
determining the ALP.
7\. The ld. AR argued on the Working Capital Adjustment and the Foreign
Exchange Gain/Loss, we found in the course of hearing, no details were filed
in respect of Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss and the DRP referred at para 8 of
order where the assessee has failed to submit the details. As prayed by the
ld. AR, we restore these disputed issues to the file of TPO with a direction
to consider the claim of assessee and the assessee shall submit the details in
respect of foreign exchange fluctuation. Similarly, the adjustment benefit of
+/- 5% was not considered by the TPO in his order and the same has to be
allowed and we order accordingly.
8\. In the result, the assessee's appeal is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
