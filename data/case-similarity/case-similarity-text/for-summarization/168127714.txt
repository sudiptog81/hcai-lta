                               1
       IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU
           DATED THIS THE 20TH DAY OF DECEMBER, 2016
                            BEFORE
              THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B. VEERAPPA

    BETWEEN:

    AGED ABOUT 62 YEARS,
                                            ... PETITIONER
and hence it requires an enquiry. Therefore the learned Chief Judge rightly
held that there is no substance in the contentions of the respondents for
dismissal of the HRC Petition by invoking Order-7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC.
Accordingly, the learned Chief Judge has dismissed the application. The
reasons assigned and  44 the conclusion arrived at by the Court below are just
and proper.
28\. For the reasons stated above, the point raised in the writ petition has
to be answered in favour of the petitioner/landlord (present respondent)
holding that the trial Court is justified in dismissing the application filed
by the respondents under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) r/w Section 151 of CPC. The
respondents (present petitioners) have not made out any ground to interfere
with the impugned order passed by the trial court at this stage exercising the
powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. However it is made clear that any
observations made by the trial Court as well as this Court while deciding the
application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of Code of  45 Civil
                                            ... PETITIONER

                                           ... RESPONDENT
    (BY SRI SRIVATSA, SENIOR COUNSEL FOR
    SRI SOMNATH H.S., ADVOCATE FOR C/R )
                                  2
         THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLE 227
    OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO QUASH THE
    ORDER DATED 28.10.2016 PASSED BY THE LEARNED
    CHIEF JUDGE, COURT OF SMALL CAUSES, BANGALORE IN
    H.R.C. NO.63/2016 VIDE ANNEXURE-F AND FURTHER TO
    ALLOW THE INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION FILED UNDER
    ORDER VII RULE 11(a) & (d) OF THE CPC.
        THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
    RESERVED    FOR   ORDERS,   COMING  ON   FOR
    PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT
    MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                            ORDER
This Writ Petition is filed by the Respondent Nos.3 and 4 (before the trial
Court) against the order dated 28th October 2016 passed by the learned Chief
Judge, Court of Small Causes, Bangalore in HRC No.63/2016 dismissing the
Interlocutory Application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) &
(d) read with Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('CPC' for short).
2\. Parties are referred to as per their ranking in the HRC Petition.
3\. Petitioner/landlord filed HRC No.63/2016 praying to pass an order of
eviction directing the respondents to vacate and hand over the vacant
possession of the schedule premises on the ground that the original tenant not
being in  3 occupation of the leased premises and on the ground of persons in
occupation having failed to prove that they are bonafide tenants under the
provisions of Section 27(b)(ii), 27(d)(i)(ii) and 27(p) of the Karnataka Rent
Act, 1999.
4\. It is the case of the petitioner - Ramachandrasa before the trial Court
that he is the landlord and Respondent No.1 was the tenant in respect of shop
premises presently bearing Shop No.1, Ground Floor, Maruthi Plaza Block-'C',
U.M. Lane, Chickpet, Bangalore, morefuly described in the schedule to the HRC
Petition. The Petitioner and the 1st respondent have entered into the
registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985 and the 1st respondent was inducted as a
tenant under the petitioner and was put in possession of the schedule
premises. The 1st respondent is a partnership firm which is represented by the
2nd respondent who was the actual and original partner of the 1st respondent -
firm. In the said registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985, the 1st respondent
was specifically restrained from sub-letting the schedule premises to any  4
third parties without the consent of the petitioner in writing and also
restrained the 1st respondent from selling the on- going concern i.e., the 1st
respondent firm under the name and style "M/s Mahendra Watch Company" without
the written consent of the petitioner. The 2nd respondent who is the actual
and original partner of the 1st respondent firm has not been in occupation and
possession of the schedule premises from the last three years without any
reasonable cause and none of the family members of the 2nd respondent is in
the occupation and possession of the schedule premises. He further contended
that Respondent Nos.3 and 4 who are strangers with regard to the tenancy of
the 1st respondent in respect of the schedule premises are unlawfully
occupying the schedule premises and there is total and complete absence of
Respondent Nos.1 and 2 who are the original tenants in the schedule premises
and only the name board of the 1st respondent was put in the schedule
premises. The Respondent Nos.3 and 4 without  5 any authority are occupying
the schedule premises and they are not tenants in the schedule premises and
they do not have or possess any valid tenancy right over the schedule
premises. The petitioner further contended that Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have
sub-let the schedule premises to Respondent Nos.3 and 4 and they sold the on-
going concern i.e., the 1st respondent firm under the name and style of "M/s
Mahendra Watch Company" to Respondent Nos.3 and 4, which is in violation of
terms and conditions of the registered sale deed dated 22.2.1985. Respondent
Nos.1 and 2 have committed the breach with regard to terms and conditions in
the registered sale deed dated 22.2.1985 and therefore the tenancy of the 1st
respondent is liable to be terminated. It is further contended that the
schedule premises is leased by the petitioner to the 1st respondent only,
which is a partnership firm by virtue of the registered lease deed dated
22.2.1985. Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are strangers and they do not  6 have any
right whatsoever in nature with regard to the tenancy of the 1st respondent in
respect of the schedule premises. Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are illegally holding
the schedule premises under Respondent Nos.1 and 2 in violation of terms and
conditions of the registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985. Therefore petitioner
filed the present HRC Petition for eviction as sought for.
5\. Respondent Nos.1,3 & 4 filed the written statement denying the plaint
averments. They contended that the 1st respondent is a partnership firm and
Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are the present partners of the said firm. Respondent
Nos.3 and 4 are brothers and both are sons of Sri Mohanlal D. Jain and they
together constitute Hindu Undivided Family. The 1st respondent is a
partnership firm and it is carrying on business since last four decades. Sri
Mohanlal D. Jain was carrying on business alongwith Shanthilal, Mahendra Kumar
and Ashish Kumar in partnership. In the  7 course of time, Shanthi lal and
Mohan lal retired and Ashish Kumar & Atul Kumar are carrying on business of
electronic goods. It is further contended that the petitioner has taken the
premises on long lease from Srimad Jagadguru Madhavacharya Moola
Mahasamsthane, Uttaradi Math in the year 1983 for a long lease of 55 years and
at that time, the respondents were already tenants of Shop No.26. After taking
the premises on lease, the petitioner got the old premises demolished and
constructed new building in the name and style "Maruti Plaza" consisting of
Basement Floor, Ground Floor, First Floor and Second Floor. Each floor has
shops ranging from 48 to 55 shops. While delivering the shop to the old
tenants, the area was reduced to 50% of the original area. Thus the
respondents got shop measuring 95 square feet and they entered into registered
lease agreement with the petitioner on 22.2.1985. As per the said agreement,
advance of Rs.500/- was paid by the respondents and rent was fixed at  8
Rs.85/- per month and was entitled to enjoy and occupy the premises for whole
of the lease period of 53 years. The respondents further contended that the
petitioner has demanded enhanced rents from all the tenants in occupation
including the respondent - firm. The respondent firm agreed for reasonable
amount. But the demand of the petitioner was unreasonable. Therefore he filed
the false and frivolous petition. Under the lease deed executed, the
respondent firm has to pay monthly rents of Rs.485/- per month. But the demand
of the petitioner is Rs.3,000/-. The respondent firm agreed to enhance the
rents by 100%. There are 11 tenants in the Maruthi Plaza. As on today, there
are many shops lying vacant, which has been evicted from the tenants by filing
frivolous petitions. The petitioner is the owner of three more shopping
complexes within the 200 meters of schedule complex, by name Maruti Tower,
Maruti Arcade and Raghavendra Complex. The petition is not in accordance  9
with the scheme of Karnataka Rent Act, 1999 and the petitioner has not come to
the Court with clean hands and has submitted falsehood in the pleadings and as
such he is playing fraud on the Court. The registered sale deed is for a
period of 53 years, which expires in the year 2038. Therefore the petition for
eviction filed by the petitioner is not maintainable and the Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Even after the expiry of the lease
period, the respondents have right to continue as tenants in the schedule shop
premises, as per the registered lease deed, under the principal lessor/owner
of the property. Thus the tenancy rights of the respondents are in perpetuity
and therefore the petition is liable to be rejected. It is further contended
that the petitioner has no cause of action etc. On these grounds, the
respondents sought for dismissal of the HRC petition.
10
6\. During the pendency of the said petition, respondents filed an application
under Order 7 Rule 11(a) &
(d) r/w Section 151 of CPC to dismiss the petition on the ground that the
petition does not disclose the cause of action; it is barred by time; the
petitioner has played fraud on the Court suppressing the material fact that
the respondents are lessees under the registered lease deed and the period
expires in the year 2038. The respondents reiterating the averments made in
the written statement contended that lease period has not yet expired. The
petitioner has no right to file eviction petition on frivolous grounds and
plead according to the whims and fancies to bring the matter within the
purview of Karnataka Rent Act, 1999\. The petitioner has played fraud on the
Court by not pleading that registered lease deed has been executed in favour
of the respondents and the lease period is yet to expire. According to the
respondents, the HRC Court has no jurisdiction to decide the matter.
11
7\. The petitioner/landlord has filed objections to the said application
denying the averments made in the application and contended that the
petitioner who is the senior citizen, aged about 86 years has approached the
Court with the present HRC petition with utmost honesty and with clean hands.
The allegations made in the application and the affidavit of Mr. Atul M. Jain
are denied as false, frivolous and vexatious. The Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are
utter strangers to the 1st respondent as well as the petitioner and the
present application is filed only with an intention to drag on and protract
the proceedings. It is further stated that in paragraph-19 of the petition,
the petitioner has clearly stated the cause of action for filing the present
petition by producing document Nos.1 to 29 alongwith the petition. Further,
the petitioner has made disclosure of each and every material facts in the
present case. The documents produced by the petitioner also make primafacie
case in favour of the petitioner and the  12 allegations made by Respondent
Nos.3 and 4 that the petitioner has played fraud on the Court by suppressing
the facts is a defamatory statement. It is further contended that the petition
filed by the petitioner under the provisions of Section 27(b)(ii),
27(d)(i)(ii) and 27(p) of the Karnataka Rent Act, 1999 alleging that the
respondents violated the terms and conditions of the lease deed dated
22.2.1985. The entire case of the petitioner is that the respondents have
violated terms and conditions of the lease deed dated 22.2.1985. Hence the
petitioner has terminated the tenancy of the 1st respondent in respect of the
petition schedule premises by issuing notice and HRC Petition is not barred by
law as alleged. The petitioner has made a strong case against the respondents
for eviction of respondents from the petition schedule premises and prays for
dismissal of the application.
13
8\. After considering the application and the objections filed by both the
parties, the learned Judge of Court of Small Causes by the impugned order
dated 28.10.2016 has dismissed the application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a)
&
(d) r/w Section 151 of CPC on the ground that without holding an enquiry, the
Court cannot come to the conclusion as to whether Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are
strangers or partners and hence it requires an enquiry. Being aggrieved, the
respondent Nos.3 and 4 filed the present writ petition.
9\. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties to the lis.
10\. Sri Paras Jain, learned advocate for the petitioner herein while
reiterating the averments made in the written statement as well as in the
application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC contended that in view
of the registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985, the lease was for 53  14 years
and therefore HRC petition is not maintainable and the Small Causes Court has
no jurisdiction to decide the Petition. The petitioner/landlord has suppressed
the material facts about the registered lease deed in paragraph- 4 of the
plaint and there is no cause of action for the petitioner and HRC Petition is
barred by law. Therefore he sought to set aside the impugned order by allowing
the writ petition. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel for the
petitioner has relied upon the following Judgments:
1\. (2005)3 SCC 422 {MANGAL PRASAD TAMOLI (DEAD) BY LRS. .vs. NARVADESHWAR
MISHRA (DEAD) BY LRS. AND OTHERS}
2\. (1994)1 SCC 1 (S.P. CHENGALVARAYA NAIDU (DEAD) BY LRS. .vs. JAGANNATH
(DEAD) BY LRS. AND OTEHRS)
3\. (2005)7 SCC 605 (BHAURAODAGDU PARALKAR .vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND
OTHERS)
4\. (1998)2 SCC 70 (I.T.C. LIMITED .vs. DEBTS RECOVERY APPELATE TRIBUNAL AND
OTEHRS)
5\. AIR 1977 SC 2421 (T. ARIVANDANDAM .vs. T.V. SATYAPAL AND ANOTEHR)  15
6\. (2006)3 SCC 100 {MAYAR (H.K.) LIMITED AND OTHERS .VS. OWENRS & PARTIES,
VESSEL M.V. FORTUNE EXPRESS AND OTEHRS}
11\. Per contra, Sri Srivatsa, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent
herein sought to justify the impugned order passed by the trial court and
strenuously contended that paragraph-19 of the lease deed clearly depicts that
the Lessee shall not sub-let the schedule premises without the consent of the
Lessor. Admittedly Respondent Nos.3 and 4, who are sub-tenants of Respondent
Nos.1 and 2 have been in possession and occupation of the premises. Therefore
the petition filed by the landlord under Section 27(b)(ii) of the Karnataka
Rent Act, 1999 for eviction is maintainable. He further contended that in the
application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) r/w section 151 of CPC, the
prayer is to dismiss the petition and not to reject the plaint. Therefore the
very application is not maintainable. He further contended  16 that in
paragraph-2 of the affidavit filed in support of the application under Order 7
Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC, it is stated that the lease deed having not expired,
the petition is barred by law and in paragraph-3 of the affidavit, it is
stated that the petitioner/landlord has no right to file eviction petition on
frivolous grounds and play fraud on the Court by not pleading that registered
lease deed has been executed in favour of the respondents and the lease period
yet to expire. He further contended that when the lease deed produced as per
Document No.4 alongwith the plaint, there is no question of suppression of
facts. Insofar as the contention of the petitioner herein that the Court has
no jurisdiction to decide the matter, learned counsel for the respondent
herein submits that the Court cannot dismiss the petition and at the most, it
can return the plaint for presentation of the same before the proper Court. He
further contended that in paragraph-19 of the plaint, it is specifically
stated that the cause of action for the present  17 petition arose on
18.2.2016. He further contended that the plaint can be rejected only on the
basis of the plaint averments and not on the basis of the averments made in
the written statement or in the application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC
and the plaint is not barred by any law. In support of his submission, learned
counsel for the respondent sought to rely on the following judgments:
1\. (2012)8 SCC 706 {CHURCH OF CHRIST CHARITABLE TRUST AND EDUCATIONAL
CHARITABLE SOCIETY REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRMAN .vs. PONNIAMMAN EDUCATIONAL
TRUST REPRESENTED BY ITS CHAIRPERSON/MANAGING TRUSTEE)
2\. AIR 2007 Patna 1 (KAPILDEO PRASAD AND ANOTHER .vs. RAMANAND PRASAD AND
OTHERS}
3\. AIR 1970 All (FB) {JAGAN NATH PRASAD AND OTHERS .vs. SHRIMATI CHANDRAWATI
AND ANOTEHR} (paragraphs 5 and 6)
12\. In view of the aforesaid rival contentions urged by the learned counsel
for the parties, the only point that arises for consideration in the present
writ petition is:  18
> "Whether the impugned order passed by the trial Court dismissing the
> application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) r/w Section 151 of CPC
> calls for any interference by this Court in the facts and circumstances of
> the present case ?"
13\. It is an undisputed fact that the respondent herein who is the petitioner
before the trial Court filed the petition for eviction under the provisions of
Section 27(b)(ii), 27(d)(i)(ii) and 27(p) of the Karnataka Rent Act, 1999
contending that the petitioner/landlord is a long term lease holder of the
entire immovable property bearing Municipal New No.22 to 33, situated at
Uttaradi Mutt Lane, Chickpet, Bangalore having obtained lease for a period of
55 years by virtue of the registered lease deed dated 2.2.1983. In terms of
the said registered lease deed, the petitioner/landlord was authorized and
empowered to sub- lease any or all portion of the said property. The
petitioner
\- M.V. Ramachandrasa is a landlord and the 1st respondent is a tenant under
him in respect of the shop premises  19 presently bearing No.1, Ground Floor,
Maruthi Plaza Block- 'C', U.M. Lane, Chickpet, Bangalore. The
petitioner/landlord and the 1st respondent at the inception of the tenancy
have entered into a registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985 as per Document No.4
and the 1st respondent was put in possession of the same. As per Clause-19 of
the registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985, the 1st respondent was specifically
restrained from sub-letting the schedule premises to any third parties without
the consent of the petitioner/landlord. It is further case of the
petitioner/landlord that Respondent Nos.3 and 4 who are strangers with regard
to the tenancy of the 1st respondent are illegally and unlawfully occupying
the schedule premises in utter violation of the terms of the lease deed and
have no right whatsoever nature with regard to the tenancy of the 1st
respondent. Therefore petitioner - M.V. Ramachandrasa filed the petition for
eviction on the ground of bonafide use and occupation.
20
14\. In the written statement, the respondents have denied the entire plaint
averments and contended that Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are also partners of the
1st respondent and therefore they are not strangers or sub- tenants as
alleged. Further, the petition filed by the petitioner/landlord is not
maintainable in view of the lease deed dated 22.2.1985 executed by the
petitioner/landlord in favour of the 1st respondent for a period of 53 years
and Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the HRC Petition.
15\. In view of the above pleadings of the parties, it is clear that there is
a dispute with regard to the relationship of landlord and tenant between the
petitioner and Respondent Nos.3 and 4. According to the petitioner/landlord,
Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are sub- tenants of Respondent No.1 and same is in
violation of clause-19 of the lease deed dated 22.2.1985. According to the
respondents, Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are the partners  21 of the 1st
respondent. There is a dispute between the parties and therefore it has to be
adjudicated after full fledged trial. It is the case of the respondents in the
application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) that the petitioner/landlord
has suppressed the material fact that the respondents are lessees under the
registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985 and further there is no cause of action
and the HRC petition is liable to be dismissed as barred by time. It is also
not in dispute that the lease deed is produced by the petitioner/landlord
along with the plaint as Document No.4. The entire document was before the
Court. When the lease deed is referred in the plaint and the document is
produced, suppression as alleged by the respondents cannot be accepted.
16\. If the Court has no jurisdiction as contended by the respondents and the
petition filed is outside the jurisdiction on account of change in law, the
22 petitioner/landlord should not be non-suited for no fault of him, but the
proper course to be followed is to have recourse to Order 7 Rules 10 and 10A
of CPC to return the plaint for presentation of the same before the proper
Court. My view is fortified by the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of R.S.D.V. FINANCE CO. PVT. LTD. .vs. SHREE VALLABH GLASS WORKS LTD.
reported in (1993)2 SCC 130 wherein it is held as under:
> 7\. We have heard Learned counsel for the parties and have perused the
> record. In our view the Learned Division Bench was wrong in holding that in
> the facts and circumstances of this case the Bombay High Court had no
> jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The amount of Rs. 10,00,000 itself was
> paid by a cheque dated 5.7.1983 drawn on the Canara Bank and the said amount
> was deposited in the bank account of the defendant at the Bank of Baroda,
> Nariman Point, Bombay. On 11.7.1983 the defendant issued a deposit receipt
> and the said deposit receipt contained an endorsement of  23 'Subject to

> also not in dispute that the amount of Rs. 10,00,000 along with interest was

> 2,00,000 each drawn on Bank of Baroda, Nariman Point, Bombay dated 23rd,
> 24th, 25th, 29th and 30th November, 1983 respectively. It is also an

> our opinion was clearly wrong in holding that the suit was not based on the

> to Anand jurisdiction'.
The entire reading of the plaint clearly shows that the suit was based not
only on the basis of the deposit receipt of Rs. 10,00,000 but also on the
basis of the five post dated cheques. Even if there was any doubt in the mind
of the Division Bench, the Learned counsel for the plaintiff had made a
request for allowing him to amend the plaint but such request was wrongly
refused by the Learned Division Bench. The Division Bench was totally wrong in
passing an order of dismissal of suit itself when it had arrived to the
conclusion that the Bombay Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The only
course to be adopted in such circumstances was to return the plaint for
presentation to the proper court and not to dismiss the suit. It may be
further noted that the Learned Single Judge trying the suit had recorded a
finding that the Bombay Court had jurisdiction to entertain and decide the
suit. Sub- sec.(1) of Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that
no objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed by any appellate or
revisional Court unless such objection was  25 taken in the Court of first
instance at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues
are settled at or before such settlement and unless there has been consequent
failure of justice. The above provision clearly lays down that such objection
as to the place of suing shall be allowed by the appellate or revisional court
subject to the following conditions :-
> (i) That such objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the
> earliest possible opportunity;
> (ii) in all cases where issues are settled then at or before such settlement
> of issues;
> (iii) there has been a consequent failure of justice.
8\. In the present case though the first two conditions are satisfied but the
third condition of failure of justice is not fulfilled. As already mentioned
above there was no dispute regarding the merits of the claim. The defendant
has admitted the deposit of Rs. 10,00,000 by the plaintiff, as well as the
issuing of the five cheques. We are thus clearly of the view that  26 there is
no failure of justice to the defendant by decreeing of the suit by the Learned
Single Judge of the Bombay High Court, on the contrary it would be totally
unjust and failure of justice to the plaintiff in case such objection relating
to jurisdiction is to be maintained as allowed by the Division Bench of the
High Court in its appellate jurisdiction.
17\. It is also not in dispute that the plaint can be rejected only on the
basis of the averments made in the plaint and not on the basis of the
averments made in the written statement or in the application filed under
Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of SALEEM BHAI .vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA reported in AIR
2003 SC 759 wherein the Apex Court has held as under:
9\. A perusal of Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C.
makes it clear that the relevant facts which need to be looked into for
deciding an application  27 thereunder are the averments in the plaint. The
trial court can exercise the power under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. at any stage
of the suit-before registering the plaint or after issuing summons to the
defendant at any time before the conclusion of the trial. For the purposes of
deciding an application under clauses (a) and (d) of Rule 11 of Order VII
C.P.C. the averments in the plaint are germane; the pleas taken by the
defendant in the written statement would be wholly irrelevant at that stage,
therefore, a direction to file the written statement without deciding the
application under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. cannot but be procedural
irregularity touching the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court. The
order, therefore, suffers from non- exercising of the jurisdiction vested in
the court as well as procedural irregularity. The High Court, however, did not
advert to these aspects.
10\. We are, therefore, of the view that for the afore-mentioned reasons, the
common order under challenge is liable to be set aside and we, accordingly, do
so. We remit the cases to the  28 trial court for deciding the application
under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. on the basis of the averments in the plaint,
after affording an opportunity of being heard to the parties in accordance
with law.
18\. Admittedly, the respondents have not made out a case to reject or dismiss
the plaint on the basis of the plaint averments, exercising the powers under
Order 7 Rules 11(a) and (d) of CPC. It is also not in dispute that in the
present case, the petitioner/landlord has produced the registered lease deed
dated 22.2.1985 as Document No.4 alongwith the plaint. Once the document is
part and parcel of the plaint and though its terms are not set out in the
plaint, but referred to in the plaint, the said document gets incorporated by
reference in the plaint. My view is fortified by the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CHURCH OF CHRIST CHARITABLE TRUST EDUCTIONAL
CHARITABLE SOCIETY .vs. PONNIAMMAN EDUCATIONAL  29 TRUST reported in (2012)8
SCC 706 wherein the Apex Court has held as under:
> 18\. In the light of the controversy, we have gone through all the averments
> in the plaint. In paragraph 4 of the plaint, it is alleged that the 2nd

19\. It is an undisputed fact that according to the petitioner/landlord, he
has produced the registered lease deed dated 22.2.1985 as Document No.4
alongwith the plaint, but according to the respondents, the
petitioner/landlord has suppressed the fact that the lease was for a period of
53 years by playing fraud on the Court. The said controversy has to be decided
at the time of final adjudication of the dispute between the parties and
cannot be decided at the threshold while disposing of an application filed
under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC for rejection of the plaint. In this connection,
it is useful to refer the decision of the Patna High Court in the case of
KAPILDEO PRASAD & ANOTHER .vs. RAMANAND PRASAD & OTHERS reported in AIR 2007
Patna 1 wherein it is observed as under:
31
7\. Now coming to the first ground raised in support of the application that
by concealing material particulars, the plaintiffs have committed fraud which
disentitles them to any relief and, accordingly, the plaint should be
rejected. I am afraid, the principle has been argued beyond its obvious
application. The principle that "fraud vitiates all" cannot be extended to
rejection of a plaint. Fraud is a question of fact to be established in course
of trial. What is stated in the written statement is merely the defence of the
defendant which has to be proved in accordance with law and received in
evidence. It is then that those facts can be taken note of and acted upon.
Moreover, a reference to the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of S.P.
Chengalvaraya Naidu AIR 1994 SC 853 (supra), as referred to by Shri S.S.
Dwivedi, and those line of cases would show that in all those cases, some
benefit had accrued to the party by practising fraud. The Courts, using the
said principle, cancelled, the benefit accrued. In the present case, it cannot
be said that any benefit has yet accrued to the plaintiffs even if it  32 be
assumed that the plaintiffs intended to commit a fraud. The principle is
unexceptionable but has no application to the facts of the present case. I am
aware of the principle of suppressio veri suggestio falsi but that principle
also applies when the end result has to be considered in a trial or in a
proceeding. Here, the Court is requested to use the said principle to throw
out the plaint at the very threshold. In my opinion, those principles cannot
be applied at this stage of the proceeding.
20\. The averments made Paragraph- 19 of the plaint clearly depicts that the
cause of action arose on 18.2.2016. Therefore the contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioner herein that the plaint does not disclose the cause
of action cannot be accepted. There is a clear distinction between a case
where the plaint does not disclose the cause of action and where after trial,
the Court comes to the conclusion that there is no cause of action in the HRC
Petition. Admittedly, in the present case at paragraph-19  33 of the plaint it
is clearly mentioned that the cause of action arose on 18.2.2016. It is for
the respondent to show that there was no cause of action as on 18.2.2016 after
full fledged trial between the parties. My view is fortified by the Full Bench
decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of JAGAN NATH PRASAD AND
OTHERS .vs. SHRIMATI CHANDRAWATI AND ANOTEHR reported in AIR 1970 All 309 (FB)
wherein it is held as under:
> 5\. Undoubtedly an appeal is a projection of the suit and the suit can still
> be said to be pending decision in this second appeal. It has been argued on
> behalf of the appellants that Clause (a) of Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C.,
> inter alia, provides that "the plaint shall be rejected ..... where it does
> not disclose a cause of action".
This is a mandatory provision of law which goes to the root of the matter and
the Court has no option but to reject the plaint where there is total want of
cause of action, as is alleged to be the position in this case. Therefore, it
is urged that there was no valid plaint or suit in the  34 present case before
the Court below and, therefore, no decree could have legally been passed on
the basis of such a plaint, which did not disclose any cause of action and had
to be rejected.
6\. Initially I was impressed by the above argument and was inclined to accept
the same but on closer scrutiny I find that there is a clear distinction
between a case where the plaint itself does not disclose any cause of action
and a case in which, after the parties have produced oral and documentary
evidence, the Court, on consideration of the entire material on record, comes
to the conclusion that there was no cause of action for the suit. In the
latter case, obviously, the plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII, Rule
11, C.P.C. The instant one is a case where on the face of the plaint it could
not be said that it did not disclose any cause of action. It was after the
entire evidence had been led and documents produced in the case considered
that the trial Court came to the conclusion that in point of fact and law it
had not been proved that the tenant had committed any  35 default in payment
of arrears of rent within the statutory period, so as to expose him to the
penalty of eviction from the accommodation, on the ground of his alleged
default in payment of rent, after the receipt of the notice of demand. The
above argument of the appellants, though plausible, has no substance and has
to be rejected, because it is a case where it was ultimately proved that there
was no cause of action for the suit and not a case where the plaint itself did
not disclose a cause of action.
21\. As already stated above, the plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11
only on the basis of the plaint averments. Admittedly, the respondents have
not made out any ground to reject the plaint on the basis of the plaint
averments. Admittedly in the present application filed by the respondents
under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) read with Section 151 of CPC, respondents did
not sought for rejection of plaint, but sought to dismiss the petition.
Whether the petitioner/landlord has suppressed the fact  36 that the lease was
for 53 years; whether he has played fraud on the Court; and whether there is
any cause of action, have to be adjudicated between the parties only after
full fledged trial and cannot be rejected at the threshold in view of the
averments made in the written statement as well as in the application filed by
the respondent under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC. On that ground alone,
the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
22\. Learned counsel for the petitioner herein relied on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of BHAURAO DAGDU PARALKAR .vs. STATE OF
MAHARASHTRA AND OTHERS reported in (2005)7 SCC 605. That case was decided
following the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.P.
CHENGALVARAYA NAIDU .vs. JAGANNATH reported in (1994)1 SCC 1. The said case
was decided on merits of the case with regard to the fraud and suppression of
facts by  37 the petitioner therein and not while considering the provisions
of Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC. If ultimately the respondents are able to
prove the fraud and the suppression of facts by the petitioner/landlord, it is
for the Court to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. Therefore the
said Judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
23\. Learned counsel for the petitioner herein has also referred the Judgment
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ITC LIMITED .vs. DEBTS RECOVERY
APELLATE TRIBUNAL AND OTHERS reported in (1998)2 SCC 70 wherein the Apex Court
held that the plaint can be rejected only on the ground that no valid cause of
action has been shown and while considering the application under Order-7
Rule-11 of CPC to find out whether the plaint did not disclose the cause of
action, the Court should not look into anything else except the plaint.
Admittedly in the present  38 case, at paragraph-19 of the plaint, the
petitioner/landlord has mentioned that the cause of action arose on 18.2.2016.
Therefore the Court cannot look into any other material including the written
statement while considering the application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) &
(d) of CPC except the plaint avernments. The dictum laid down in the above
case will not in any way helpful to the petitioner herein in the present writ
petition.
24\. Learned counsel for the petitioner herein has also referred the decision
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of MANGAL PRASAD TAMOLI (DEAD) BY
L.Rs. .vs. NARVADESHWAR MISHRA (DEAD) BY L.RS. AND OTHERS reported in (2005)3
SCC 422 wherein the Apex Court has held that in the absence of a special
condition entitling the mortgagor to redeem during the term for which the
mortgage is created, the right of redemption can only arise on the expiration
of the specified period; If a suit for redemption is filed prematurely, it is
not open to the Court  39 to continue with the suit on the ground that the
plaintiff has agreed not to take possession before the due date. Admittedly in
the present case though in terms of the lease deed, 53 years would expire in
the year 2038, the fact remains that according to the petitioner/landlord,
clause-19 of the lease deed is violated. Therefore it has to be adjudicated by
the trial Court as to whether the lessee has violated the terms of the lease
or not. The case referred to by the learned counsel was with regard to the
mortgage. The facts of the said case have no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
25\. Learned counsel for the petitioner herein has also relied upon the
Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T. ARIVANDANAM .vs. T.V.
SATYAPAL AND ANOTHER reported in AIR 1977 SC 2421. The said decision pertains
to rejection of the plaint for false and vexatious claim. In the said case, it
is held that if on a meaningful  40 reading of the plaint, it is manifestly
vexatious and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue,
the trial Court should exercise its power under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC taking
care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled; The trial Courts
should insist imperatively on examining the party at the first hearing so that
bogus litigation can be shot down at the earliest stage. Admittedly, in the
present case, by reading of the plaint, it is not manifestly vexatious and
meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue. In the present
case, it is not disputed the relationship of landlord and tenant between the
petitioner and Respondent Nos.1 and 2 and the dispute is only with regard to
the relationship of petitioner and Respondent Nos.3 and 4. The relationship
and the right to sue under Section 27(b)(ii), 27(d)(iii) and 27(p) of the
Karnataka Rent Act, 1999 is not disputed. Ultimately, the matter has to be
adjudicated by the trial Court after full fledged trial. Therefore the
judgment relied  41 upon by the learned counsel has no application to the
facts and circumstances of the present case.
.
26\. Learned counsel for the petitioner herein has also relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of MAYAR (H.K.) LTD. AND
OTHERS .vs. OWNERS & PARTNERS, VESSEL M.V. FORTUNE EXPRESS AND OTHERS reported
in (2006)3 SCC 100. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with
rejection of plaint for suppression of material facts when permissible and
manner in which such power to be exercised and burden of proof on defendant to
obtain rejection of plaint on such ground etc., Such rejection is permissible
only if the suppressed fact is material, in the sense that had it not been
suppressed, it would have had an effect on the merits of the case, whatever
view the Court may have taken. To obtain such rejection, the defendant must
show that plaintiff could not possibly succeed on the basis of the pleadings
and in the  42 circumstances of the case, given the suppression of the facts.
Admittedly in the present case allegation of suppression of material facts has
been denied by the petitioner/landlord and contended that he has produced the
very lease deed alongwith the plaint as Document No.4. Question of suppressing
the document does not arise. When the document is before this Court, the
contents of the entire document have to be looked into. There is a dispute
between the parties and the same has to be adjudicated after full fledged
trial. Therefore the said judgment is not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case to reject the plaint without any
adjudication.
27\. The trial Court considering the entire material on record, recorded a
finding that it is important to note that when the petitioner/landlord
contends that Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have sublet the premises in favour of
Respondent Nos.3 and 4 and when the respondents denied that Respondent Nos.3
and 4 are sub-tenants and on the  43 other hand they are also partners of the
1st respondent firm, the same requires enquiry and the Court has to see
whether there is a cause of action or not in the petition. The contention of
the petitioner/landlord is that the lease period is till 2038 and in violation
of the terms and conditions of the lease, Respondent Nos.3 and 4 were
inducted, who are strangers and this aspect also requires trial. Having taken
note of the same, the learned Chief Judge was of the considered opinion that
without holding enquiry, the Court cannot come to the conclusion as to whether
Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are strangers or partners of the 1st respondent firm
and hence it requires an enquiry. Therefore the learned Chief Judge rightly
held that there is no substance in the contentions of the respondents for
dismissal of the HRC Petition by invoking Order-7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of CPC.
Accordingly, the learned Chief Judge has dismissed the application. The
reasons assigned and  44 the conclusion arrived at by the Court below are just
and proper.
28\. For the reasons stated above, the point raised in the writ petition has
to be answered in favour of the petitioner/landlord (present respondent)
holding that the trial Court is justified in dismissing the application filed
by the respondents under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) r/w Section 151 of CPC. The
respondents (present petitioners) have not made out any ground to interfere
with the impugned order passed by the trial court at this stage exercising the
powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. However it is made clear that any
observations made by the trial Court as well as this Court while deciding the
application filed under Order 7 Rule 11(a) & (d) of Code of  45 Civil
Procedure, 1908 shall not influence the learned trial Judge while deciding the
HRC Petition on merits.
