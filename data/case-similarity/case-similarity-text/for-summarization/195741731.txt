                               REASONS
         The Sub Inspector of Police, Upparapet Police Station,
    Bangalore has filed this charge sheet against the accused
    Nos.1 to 3 for the offences punishable under section 51(a), (b)
    and 63 of Copyright Act.
         2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on
    26-8-2013 in Sancos Shop and Laloo Trading Company shop
    situated    at   Saritha   Complex,   K.G.road,    Gandhinagar,
    Bangalore within the limits of Upparapet Police Station the
    accused No.1 being the owner of Sancos Shop and accused
    No.3 being the worker in the said shop and accused No.2
    being the owner of Laloo Trading Company were found in
    possession and selling of counterfeit purse and caps in the
    name of Locasto brand over which IPR vigilance (India) Ltd.,
    Group of Companies had copyright without there being any
    authorisation or written consent from the copyright holder and
    thereby infringed the copyright and further were selling the
    same to the general public as if the said products are supplied
    by copyright holder company and cheated the copyright holder
    company as well as general public and committed aforesaid
    offences.
          3. The accused Nos.1 to 3 are on bail. On receipt of
    chargesheet, this court took cognizance of the offences and
     3                                                C.C.No.21684/2013.
    furnished the copies of the prosecution papers to the accused
    persons. After hearing on charges, this court framed the
    charge for the offences punishable under section 63 of
    Copyright Act and section 420 of IPC for which the accused
    persons pleaded not guilty, and claims to be tried.
         4.   The prosecution in order to prove its case got
    examined only one witness as P.W.1 and got marked only one
    document at Exs.P.1. Since, C.Ws.1, 3 to 6 did not turn up
    before this court, by rejecting the prayer of Sr.APP, this court
    dropped the examination of said witnesses.
         5. Since, there is no incriminating evidence against the
    accused Nos.1 to 3, their statement under Sec.313 of Cr.P.C.,
    is dispensed with.
         6. I have heard the arguments on both sides.
         7. The prosecution to prove the guilt against accused
    Nos.1 to 3 has examined only one witness by name Manohar.
    P.W.1 Manohar is the independent seizure mahazar witness.
    Inspite of giving sufficient opportunities the prosecution has
    not examined other witnesses on record. The testimony of
    P.W.1 indicating that on 26-8-2013 the PSI of Upparapet
    Police Station took him to Laloo Trading Company shops at
    Balepete. In the said shop they found six spurious purse and
    fifty spurious caps in the name of Locasto brand. The PSI of
     4                                              C.C.No.21684/2013.
    his police station seized the same by preparing the seizure
    mahazar. His evidence further indicating that the police have
    not prepared any mahazar in his presence and not seized any
    material objects. He identified the accused No.1 as the person
    who was present in the above-referred shop on the date of
    raid.   The PSI has conducted the seizer and brought to the
    police station.   His signature was obtained to the seizure
    mahazar in the police station but no mahazar was prepared
    and no spurious products are seized in his presence. P.W.1
    has identified the spurious caps and purse as M.Os-1 and 2.
    Since P.W.1 has not supported the case of the prosecution, the
    learned Sr.APP., treated this witness as hostile and further
    cross examined him.       In the cross examination P.W.1 has
    denied the suggestion that on 26-8-2013 the Upparapet police
    visited the shop of accused No.1, prepared the mahazar on the
    spot itself and obtained his signature. However, he admitted
    the suggestion that the accused No.2 Mansoor was present in
    the said shop.    Further he denied the suggestion that the
    police prepared the seizer mahazar in the above referred two
    shops and obtained his signature.      However, he voluntary
    stated that he affixed his one signature on the spot and
    another in the police station. In my opinion, the testimony of
    P.W.1 is not trustworthy to believe. In my further opinion, in
    order to believe the testimony of P.W.1 corroboration by other
    witnesses is necessary.
     5                                                    C.C.No.21684/2013.
         8.   As   stated    above,   inspite   of    giving   sufficient
    opportunities, the      prosecution has     not   examined      other
    witnesses on record. In a case like this, the offences has to be
    proved in a circumstantial evidence by way of proving the
    seizure mahazar of seized spurious products in the name of
    Locasto brand over which I.P.R vigilance (India) Ltd., company
    had copyright. Further the prosecution has to prove that the
    seized products are spurious, the accused Nos.1 and 2 are the
    owners of Sancos shop and Laloo Trading Company shops
    respectively. Further the prosecution has to prove that I.P.R
    vigilance (India) Ltd., Group of Company had copyright over
    the brand Locasto.      In the instant case the prosecution to
    prove the seizure mahazar has examined only one witness but
    the evidence of said witness is not trust worthy to believe. As
    stated above, at the repetition of cost, inspite of giving
    sufficient opportunities the prosecution has not examined
    other witnesses on record. Therefore, the prosecution has
    failed to prove seizure mahazar as per Ex.P.1 beyond all
    reasonable doubt.
         9. Further the prosecution has not examined any
    witnesses, has not got marked any documents to prove that
    the seized products are spurious and I.P.R vigilance (India)
    Ltd., Group of Companies had copyright over the brand
    Locasto and further the accused Nos.1 and 2 are the owners of
    above referred shops. Therefore, having regard to the evidence
     6                                                     C.C.No.21684/2013.
    on record, I am of the considered opinion that the prosecution
    has failed to prove guilt against accused Nos.1 to 3 beyond all
    reasonable doubt. In the result, I proceed to pass the
    following:
                                      ORDER
This court did not found guilt of accused Nos.1 to 3 for the offences
punishable U/s. 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 and section 420 of IPC.
