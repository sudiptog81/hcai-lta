4\. As regards the assessees appeal, we find that disputed services are Air
Travel Agents service, Business Support service, Chartered Accountant service,
Manpower Recruitment service. The Honble Bombay High Court in the case of
Coca Cola India Pvt. Ltd. vs. CCE, Pune: 2009 (15) S.T.R. 657 (Bom.) as also
in the case of CCE vs. Ultratech Cement reported as 2010 (260) E.L.T. 369
(Bom.) has held that the definition of input services is very wide and would
take into its ambit the services used directly or indirectly for rendering of
output services. There are various decisions which hold that Air Travel Agents
services procured in connection with the business trips of the employees of
the company have to be treated as essential input services. Reference can be
made to the Tribunals decision in the case of Heartland Bangalore
Transcription Ser. P. Ltd. vs. CST, Bangalore: 2011 (21) STR 430 (Tri.-Bang.).
Similarly in respect of Chartered Accountant services, the same decision of
the Tribunal holds the said services to be cenvatable services. Similarly
Manpower Recruitment services have been held to be cenvatable. As such, we
find no justifiable reason to deny the refund of the credit of service tax

HON'BLE SMT. ARCHANA WADHWA, JUDICIAL MEMBER HON'BLE SHRI ASHOK KUMAR ARYA,
TECHNICAL MEMBER Final Order No. 21587-21588 / 2015 Per : ARCHANA WADHWA Both
the appeals one filed by the appellant and the other filed by Revenue are
being disposed of by a common order as they arise out of the same impugned
order passed by the Commissioner (A).
2\. After hearing both the sides, we find that the appellant claimed refund of
input service credit utilized for their output service of Management
Consultancy Service to M/s. NEA Development Corporation, Delaware, USA. The
said refund claim of Rs.21.70 lakhs approximately was rejected by the original
adjudicating authority on the ground that their output services cannot be
considered to be export of services. However, on appeal against the said
order, the Commissioner (A) accepted the assessees stand that the services
rendered to a foreign company to find out prospective enterprises in India
seeking overseas investments are required to be considered as export of
service, in the light of the majority decision of the Tribunal in the case of
Microsoft (I) (P) Ltd. vs. CST: 2014 (36) S.T.R. 766 (Tri.-Del.). He
accordingly allowed the refund claim on Management or Business Consultancy
services; Rent-a-Cab services, Telephone services by treating the same as
cenvatable input services. However in respect of refund of credit of duty-paid
on Air Travel Agents service, Business Support service, Chartered Accountant
service, Manpower Recruitment service, he observed that they are not
something which are unavoidably required to run its business and rejected the
claim.
3\. Revenue is in appeal against that part of the impugned order of
Commissioner (A) by which he has accepted the appellants stand to hold the
output services as export of services. We find that the said issue is no
more res integra and stands settled by the majority decision of the Tribunal
in the case of Microsoft Corporation (I) P. Ltd., as referred supra. Reference
can be made to another majority decision of the Tribunal in the case of Paul
Merchants Ltd. vs. CCE, Chandigarh reported as 2013 (29) S.T.R. 257
(Tri.-Del.) as also in the case of Gap International Sourcing (India) Pvt.
Ltd. vs. Commissioner: 2014-TIOL-465-CESTAT-DEL. As such we find no merits in
the Revenues contention and accordingly reject their appeal.
4\. As regards the assessees appeal, we find that disputed services are Air
Travel Agents service, Business Support service, Chartered Accountant service,
Manpower Recruitment service. The Honble Bombay High Court in the case of
Coca Cola India Pvt. Ltd. vs. CCE, Pune: 2009 (15) S.T.R. 657 (Bom.) as also
in the case of CCE vs. Ultratech Cement reported as 2010 (260) E.L.T. 369
(Bom.) has held that the definition of input services is very wide and would
take into its ambit the services used directly or indirectly for rendering of
output services. There are various decisions which hold that Air Travel Agents
services procured in connection with the business trips of the employees of
the company have to be treated as essential input services. Reference can be
made to the Tribunals decision in the case of Heartland Bangalore
Transcription Ser. P. Ltd. vs. CST, Bangalore: 2011 (21) STR 430 (Tri.-Bang.).
Similarly in respect of Chartered Accountant services, the same decision of
the Tribunal holds the said services to be cenvatable services. Similarly
Manpower Recruitment services have been held to be cenvatable. As such, we
find no justifiable reason to deny the refund of the credit of service tax
paid on the said disputed service. Accordingly, the assessees appeal is
allowed. Both the appeals are disposed of in above manner.
