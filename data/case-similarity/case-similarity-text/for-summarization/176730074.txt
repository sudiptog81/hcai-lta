                                    आदेश    /    ORDER
    PER D. KARUNAKARA RAO, AM :
There are 3 appeals under consideration against the orders/directions of the
AO/TPO/DRP for the A.Y. 2010-11.
2\. In the Revenue's appeal, three grounds are raised and all the three
grounds revolve around the issue relating to the Transfer Pricing Adjustments
and questions the relief granted by the DRP to the assessee. Grounds of appeal
raised by the Revenue are extracted as under :
> "1. The DRP erred to exclude FCS Software Ltd. from the list of comparable
> companies, when Delhi ITAT has held in the case of Navisite India (P) to be
> a software company.
> 2\. The DRP erred by accepting assessee's contention that comparables
> selected by it after conducting TP study should be considered when Rule
> 10D(4) maintains that documents and information should exists latest by the
> 'specified date' specified in s.92F94, i.e. the due date for filing the ROI.
> 3\. The DRP erred to exclude Eclerx Services Limited from the list of
> comparable as it is KPO company, when CBDTs Circular No.890 (E) dated
> 26-09-2000 clearly mentions that KPO services are also information
> technology enabled products of services."
3\. Similarly, in the assessee's appeal, the assessee raised 4 grounds, which
has many sub-grounds, questioning the Transfer Pricing Adjustment amounting to
Rs.69,68,175/- confirmed by the DRP. All the grounds raised by the assessee
are extracted as under :
> "On the facts and circumstances of the case, and in law :
> 1\. The Ld Assessing Officer ('AO') pursuant to the directions of the Ld.
> Dispute Resolution Panel ('DRP') erred in rejecting the benchmarking
> approach adopted/contemporaneous documentation maintained by the appellant
> and thereby making a transfer pricing adjustment of Rs. 69,68,175 to the
> income of the appellant by holding that the international transactions
> pertaining to provision of customer support back office services ("ITES
> Services') to the associated enterprise ('AE') are not at arm's length under
> the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act').
> 2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. AO/DRP erred
> in modifying the benchmarking analysis, as conducted by the appellant using
> Transactional Net Margin Method ('TNMM') for benchmarking its international
> 3 ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> transactions pertaining to provision of ITES services to the AE, and thereby
> modifying the set of comparables. In doing so, the Ld AO/DRP specifically
> erred in:
> a) conducting selective fresh analysis (without sharing the fresh search
> workings with the assessee) resulting in cherry picking of comparables which
> contradicts with the principles of conducting search (for comparables) in a
> scientific manner;
> b) disregarding the fresh search provided by the assessee (on a without
> prejudice basis) using the data for FY 2009-10, whereas the Ld. AO/TPO had
> himself conducted a fresh search/ analysis.
> c) including companies which are not functionally comparable to the ITES
> services rendered by the appellant in final set of comparables (identified
> based on the fresh search/analysis conducted by the Ld TPO).
> d) rejecting companies functionally similar to that of the appellant's
> business operations from final set of comparables (and also identified based
> on the fresh search conducted by the appellant on a without prejudice
> basis).
> 3\. The Ld. DRP / AO erred in considering the single year data for the
> comparables i.e. data for FY 2009-10 only and disregarding multiple year
> data which was considered by the appellant in accordance with the provisions
> of Rule 10B(4) of the Income-tax Rule, 1962 ("Rules").
> 4\. The Ld. DRP / AO erred in not allowing an adjustment for the difference
> between the level of risk borne/assets employed by the comparables and the
> appellant as provided by the appellant, without providing any cogent
> reasons, and disregarding the provisions of Rules 10B (3) read with Rule 10C
> of the Rules. In doing so, the Ld DRP / AO erred by:
> i. Failing to capture that the appellant is a routine captive service
> provider as against the comparable companies selected by the Ld.TPO which
> include entrepreneurial companies and hence an adjustment is necessary.
> ii. Disregarding the provisions of Rule 10B(3) read with Rule 10C of the
> Rules.
> The above grounds are without prejudice to each other."
4\. Further, bringing our attention to the Cross Objection, i.e.
C.O.No.38/PUN/2015 filed by the assessee, Ld. AR for the assessee submitted
that the said Cross Objections becomes an academic issue once the grounds
raised by the Revenue are adjudicated in favour of the assessee, Ld. AR opines
that the issues raised by the Revenue are of covered nature by the order of
the Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the earlier A.Y. 2009-10.
Therefore, we shall now take up the Revenue's appeal to examine the claim of
covered nature of the issues relating to the Transfer Pricing Adjustment.  4
ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
ITA No.572/PUN/2015 (By Revenue) :
5\. Ground No.1 of the Revenue relates to the correctness of the exclusion of
FCS Software Ltd. as a comparable against the decision of the TPO who
considered the same as a good comparable.
6\. Ld. DR relied on the order of the AO and also on the order of the Delhi
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Navisite India Pvt. Ltd., which is
actually referred in the Ground No.1 of Revenue's appeal. In connection with
the exclusion of M/s. Eclerx Services Ltd. (a KPO sompany), Ld. DR for the
Revenue also relied on the circular of the CBDT for the proposition that the
KPO services of Eclerx Services Ltd. are functionally comparable to the ITeS
of the assessee.
7\. In this regard, the case of the AO and the TPO is that FCS Software Ltd.
being a Software Developer the same constitutes a good comparable. However,
the DRP found that the said company earned 42% of Revenue from Software
Services and 37% of Revenue earned from Education and 21% of the Revenue is
earned from Infrastructure Management. With the said 42% of the Revenue from
Software Services, the same does not constitute a good comparable and
therefore the DRP directed the AO/TPO to exclude the same from the list of
comparables for benchmarking the international transactions of the assessee.
8\. In connection with the said direction of the DRP, Ld. AR for the assessee
submitted before us that the FCS Software Ltd. with 42% of the total Revenue
from the Software Services cannot be considered as a good comparable in case
of benchmarking of transactions by a Software company. Bringing our attention
to the order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for the A.Y. 2008- 09 vide
ITA No.2546/PUN/2012, Ld. AR for the assessee submitted that said comparable
was considered as a good comparable by the TPO/AO. In this  5 ITA Nos.352,
572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
year, the TPO considered the filter of 75% of the total receipts from the
Software Services. On finding that the total receipts are below the said
benchmark, the Tribunal decided the case in faovur of the assessee and
considered the fact that FCS Software Ltd. does not qualify the said filter of
75%. Copy of the said order is placed in the paper book at page 873 of the
Legal compendium. On similar ground, the Tribunal excluded the said company
while adjudicating another Software company named TIBCO Software (India) Pvt.
Ltd. in ITA No.2536/PUN/2012 for the A.Y. 2008-09 (placed in the paper book at
pages 14 to 16 and 65 of the Legal compendium).
9\. On hearing both the parties on this issue, we find that FCS Software Ltd.
was not considered as a good comparable when it comes to FAR (Functions Assets
and Risks Analysis) test as well as the Revenue segment of the Software
Services earned by the said company. For the sake of completeness, we extract
the relevant paragraphs from the order of the Tribunal in the assessee's own
case (supra) and the same read as under :
> "12. Both sides heard. The assessee has assailed inclusion of FCS Software
> Solution Ltd. in final set of comparables primarily on ground that the
> company is functionally different, fails to qualify filter of 75% income
> from software development services and has abnormally high profits. We find
> that the issue regarding exclusion/inclusion of FCS Software Solutions Ltd.
> has been considered by the Co-ordinate Bench of Tribunal in the case of
> TIBCO Software India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra).
> The ld. Counsel has given a comparative analysis as to how the activities of
> the assessee and TIBCO Software India Pvt. Ltd. are at par with each other.
> The ld. DR has not disputed the same. In the case of TIBCO Software India
> Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) the Tribunal has
> excluded FCS Software Solutions Ltd. by observing as under :
> "23. We have carefully considered the rival submissions. In fact, the TPO
> has reproduced in para 15.7 the written submissions of the assessee on this
> aspect. The first plea raised by the assessee was that income earned by the
> said concern from rendering of application support services and
> infrastructure management services, which constitute 11% and 15%
> respectively of the total revenue, are in the nature of IT enabled services
> and not linked to the software development services. On this basis, it was
> sought to be pointed out that if the aforesaid income streams are excluded
> from the segment of software development services, then the income from
> software development services segment falls below 75% of the total income.
> The TPO had applied a filter to exclude such concerns from the list of  6
> ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> comparables, wherein the income from software development services was less
> than 75% of the total income. In fact, in the discussion made by the TPO in
> response to assessee's aforesaid assertions, there is no denial to the same.
> Though the TPO goes on to rely on the CBDT‟s Circular dated 26.09.2000
> (supra), but that is in relation to the activity of E-learning and Digital
> Consulting being carried out by the assessee. The segment of E-learning and
> Digital Consulting is a different segment. In any case, assessee's plea
> based on the nature of services on account of application support services
> segment and infrastructure management services segment have not been
> rebutted by the TPO. Therefore, we are inclined to hold that the application
> support services and infrastructure management services, which constitute
> 11% and 15% respectively of the total income, are IT enabled services and
> not linked to the software development services.
> 24\. Moreover, the assessee had referred to the following extract from the
> Annual Report of the said concern in relation to the E-learning and Digital
> Consulting before the TPO to say that it is in the nature of IT enabled
> services:-
> "E-learning and Digital Consulting Services:
> US corporations look at E-learning of web / CD based training programs as
> one of the ways to achieve organizational growth and improved business
> performance. E-learning helps employees, vendors, and dealers of a company
> to better their performance and deal with fast- changing environments.
> E-learning makes training highly efficient, by making it available anytime,
> anywhere and reduces total cost of training. E-learning is used to train
> employees, customers and service technicians on product knowledge, concepts,
> strategies, risk and finance, compliance and technology."
> 25\. Ostensibly, the aforesaid services involve setting up of support
> centres and remote maintenance, which have been duly categorized as ITES by
> the CBDT‟s Circular dated 26.09.2000 itself, which has been reproduced by
> the TPO in the impugned order. Therefore, even the said segment is not to be
> included as part of the software development services, as asserted by the
> assessee. Once the segment of application support and infrastructure
> management services are removed along with the exclusion of E-learning and
> Digital consulting segment, then the income of the said concern from
> software development services falls below 75% of its total income and
> therefore, it deserves to be excluded even on the basis of the filter
> applied by the TPO. Thus, on this aspect, assessee succeeds."
13\. Reliance has also been placed by the assessee on the decision of Barclays
Technology Centre Vs. ACIT (supra) to contend that FCS Software Solutions Ltd.
has abnormally high profit margin. The Co-ordinate Bench of Tribunal while
excluding FCS Software Solutions Ltd. in the said case has held as under :
> "28. We have carefully considered the rival submissions. The argument of the
> assessee in order to exclude FCS Software Solutions Ltd. from the final set
> of comparables is based on twin grounds. Firstly, it is contended that the
> said concern has declared an abnormally high profit margin of 57.02% for the
> financial year under consideration; and, secondly, that the margins of the
> said concern widely fluctuate in over the years. In the context of the
> exclusion of abnormal profit making concerns, the following discussion made
> by the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Maersk Global Centrea
> (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is worthy of notice:
7
> ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> "In generality, we are of the view that the answer to this question will
> depend on the facts and circumstances of each case inasmuch as potential
> comparable earning abnormally high profit margin should trigger further
> investigation in order to establish whether it can be taken as comparable or
> not. Such investigation should be to ascertain as to whether earning of high
> profit reflects a normal business condition or whether it is the result of
> some abnormal conditions prevailing in the relevant year. The profit margin
> earned by such entity in the immediately preceding year/s may also be taken
> into consideration to find out whether the high profit margin represents the
> normal business trend. The FAR analysis in such case may be reviewed to
> ensure that the potential comparable earning high profit satisfies the
> comparability conditions. If it is found on such investigation that the high
> margin profit making company does not satisfy the comparability analysis and
> or the high profit margin earned by it does not reflect the normal business
> condition, we are of the view that the high profit margin making entity
> should not be included in the list of comparable for the purpose of
> determining the arm's length price of an international transaction.
> Otherwise, the entity satisfying the comparability analysis with its high
> profit margin reflecting normal business condition should not be rejected
> solely on the basis of such abnormal high profit margin."
29\. The aforesaid discussion of the Special Bench reveals that a concern
which has earned abnormally high profit margin cannot be excluded from the
list of comparables straightaway without making appropriate investigations.
As per the Special Bench, it would be appropriate to ascertain as to whether
the high profit margin declared by the concern reflects a normal business
phenomenon or it has resulted because of certain abnormal conditions
prevailing in a particular year. As per the Special Bench, in order to carry
out the aforesaid analysis, the profit margins earned by such concern in the
proximate preceding and succeeding years should also be taken into
consideration so as to establish whether the high profit margins reflect a
normal business trend or otherwise. In this background of the matter, we find
that in the case of FCS Software Solutions Ltd., the margins for the two
preceding financial years are 14.75% and 19.94%, whereas in the financial year
succeeding to the year under consideration, the margin is 37.07%; and, the
margin declared for the year under consideration is 57.02%. At the time of
hearing, the Ld. Representative pointed out that in the financial year 2007-08
relevant to the assessment year under consideration the said concern's
revenues from the software activity was Rs.86.73 crores as against Rs.143.43
crores in immediately preceding year. On the contrary the expenditure incurred
on development of software for the year under consideration stood at Rs.30.44
crores as against Rs.104.35 crores in the immediately preceding year. It is
pointed out that the ratio of software development expenditure to total income
has fallen drastically from 72.75% to 35.10%, which shows that the current
year has witnessed abnormal events. All the aforesaid factual aspects of the
matter have not been disputed by the Revenue before us. From the aforesaid
analysis, it is clear that the operating margins of the said concern do not
reflect a consistent trend over the years, and in any case, the current year‟s
operations in comparison to the earlier years are quite abnormal. Considering
the entirety of circumstances, in our view, the financial results declared by
the said concern do not reflect a normal business trend and therefore in our
view the said concern is liable to be excluded from the final set of
comparables. We hold so."  8

10\. In this year under consideration too, the modified filter of the TPO qua
the percentage of total receipts out of the IT Services, the assessee recorded
42%. The same is below the filter set by the TPO for benchmarking. Considering
the above settled nature of the issue, we are of the opinion that the
direction given by the DRP in excluding the FCS Software Ltd. as a good
comparable is fair and reasonable and it does not call for any interference.
Accordingly, Ground No.1 raised by the Revenue is dismissed.
11\. Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue relates to rejection of assessee's
claim for fresh search of comparables. Bringing our attention to the direction
of the DRP, it is the submission of the assessee that the ground is mis-
conceived by the Revenue as the same is raised by the assessee in its appeal
vide Ground No.2(b) of the grounds of appeal of the assessee. Considering the
same, after hearing both the parties, we dismiss the same as mis-conceived.
12\. Ground No.2 raised by the Revenue relates to exclusion of Eclerx Services
Ltd. from the list of comparables. The AO and the TPO considered the same as a
good comparable despite the fact that the said company is engaged in KPO
services. Without disputing the same is a KPO company, it is the case of the
Revenue that the KPO services are akin to the IT Software services of the
assessee company and relied heavily on the CBDT Circular No.890 (E) dated
26-09-2000. Relying on the said circular, Revenue reasons that the KPO
services constitutes Information Technology Services and therefore, the same
constitutes a good comparable. Revenue is aggrieved against the direction of
9 ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
Ltd.
the DRP who directed for exclusion of the same for the reasons given in their
direction at para 25 of the order of the DRP dated 28-12-2014.
13\. Before the DRP, assessee reasoned that the KPO (Knowledge, Process and
Outsourcing) services are neither the IT Software services nor the ITES
services. For this proposition, assessee relied on various decisions. Further,
it is the case of the assessee that the said circular of CBDT is not up-to-
date in view of the subsequent stand of the CBDT on this issue. Bringing our
attention to the copy of the CBDT Safe Harbour Rules dated 18-09-2013 (Page
324 of the paper book), Ld. AR for the assessee demonstrated that the fact of
CBDT distinguishing the KPO services from the BPO services while fixing
different Safe Harbour margins for the different services. Thus, the Ld. AR
for the assessee demolished the TPO's view on the similarity of BPP services
with that of KPO services. Referring to the order of the DRP, Ld. AR for the
assessee submitted that the DRP gave the relief to the assessee as per the
discussion given in Pages 46 to 49 of the order. Aggrieved with the same, the
Revenue is in appeal with Ground No.3.
14\. Bringing our attention to the said Safe Harbour Rules notified by the
CBDT dated 18-09-2013, copy of which is placed at page No.324 and 325 of the
paper book filed in connection with the Stay proceedings, Ld. AR for the
assessee submitted that the KPO services are not categorized under the ITES
services. The fact of excluding M/s.Eclerx Services Ltd. was also demonstrated
by filing a copy of the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case
of Rampgreen Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Vs. CIT reported in TS-387-HC-2015 (Del.)-TP
(pages 108, 109 and 121 of the paper book). The said judgment is categorical
in stating that the KPO services cannot be compared to an entity, which is
engaged in the function of rendering Voice Call services which are
contemplates to be the lower end of the ITES services. The KPO services are
considered  10 ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software
(India) Pvt. Ltd.
advance skills representing higher end of ITES in terms of value addition.
Relevant written submissions submitted by the Ld. AR for the assessee are
extracted as under :
> "At Stay PB 314-317, is the respondent's submission before the TPO.
> The Ld. TPO has discussed about the said comparable at Appeal PB 102-103 and
> 105.

15\. Further, bringing our attention to the decision of Coordinate Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of Cummins Turbo Technologies Ltd. Vs. DCIT and vice
versa in ITA Nos. 593 and 438/PUN/2015 order dated 28-12-2016, Ld. AR for the
assessee demonstrated that the said company M/s.Eclerx Services Ltd. was
excluded as the same is not functionally found comparable with that of the
company which is engaged in Software services like the present assessee.
16\. Finally, bringing our attention to the order of the Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the A.Y. 2009-10 in ITA No.336/PUN2014 order dated
31-10-2014 (page 155 of the paper book), Ld. AR for the assessee submitted
that the Pune Bench has rejected the said company Eclerx Services Ltd. as a
good comparable as the same is engaged in KPO services only which are not
functionally comparable to that of the assessee.
17\. Ld. DR for the Revenue relied heavily on the order of the AO and the CBDT
Circular No.890 (E) dated 20-09-2000.
12
ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
18\. We heard both the parties on the issue of exclusion of Eclerx Services
Ltd. from the list of comparables as the same constitutes KPO services. The
case of the AO and the TPO is that the company with KPO services is comparable
to that of the assessee which is a Software Developers. Revenue relies heavily
on the CBDT Circular No.890 (E) dated 20-09-2000. Per Contra, the case of the
assessee is another CBDT Notification issued in 2013 in connection with the
publishing of Safe Harbour Rules defines clearly the KPO services from that of
BPO services/ITES services.
19\. On hearing both the parties, we find the arguments of the Ld. AR for the
assessee requires to be accepted. Further, we examined the order of the
Tribunal in ITA No.336/PN/2014 order dated 31-10-2014 in the assessee's own
case for the A.Y. 2009-10. The said company Eclerx Services Ltd. is found
excluded by the Tribunal as the same is engaged in KPO services which is found
to be not comparable functionally with that of the assessee's functions of
Software services/ITES services. We find from the said CBDT Notification dated
18-09-2013 that the KPO services command Safe Harbour range of 25% whereas IT
Enabled Services is only 20%. The said differentiation supports the assessee's
argument that the KPO services are not identical to the IT Enabled Services.
We proceed to extract the finding given by the Tribunal on this issue and the
same reads as under :
> "48. The next objection of the assessee was that with regard to inclusion of
> Eclerx Services Ltd. which admittedly was engaged in providing KPO services
> i.e. Knowledge Process Outsourcing, whereas the assessee was engaged in BPO
> services. The Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Maersk Global
> Centres (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) vide order dated 21.08.2014 had excluded
> the said company as a comparable while determining the margins under ITES
> segments. The Special Bench of the Tribunal vide paras 82 and 83 at pages 73
> and 74 of the order, had observed as under:-
> "keeping in view the nature of services rendered by M/s eClerx Services Pvt.
> Ltd. and its functional profile, we are of the view that this company is
> also mainly engaged in providing high-end services involving specialized
> knowledge and domain expertise in the field and the same  13 ITA Nos.352,
> 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> cannot be compared with the assessee company which is mainly engaged in
> providing low-end services to the group concerns."
> 49\. Following the same parity of reasoning, we direct the TPO to exclude
> M/s. Eclerx Services Ltd. as comparable."
20\. Thus, it is a settled issue in favour of the assessee by the decision of
the Coordinate Bench in the assessee's own case (supra). There are other
judgments in favour of the assessee. The CBDT's Notification dated 18-09- 2013
strengthens the case of the assessee in its favour. Considering the above
settled nature of the issue in the assessee's own case apart from many others,
we are of the opinion that the direction given by the DRP on this issue is
fair and reasonable and it does not call for any interference. Accordingly,
Ground No.3 raised by the Revenue is dismissed.
21\. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is dismissed. C.O.
No.38/PUN/2015 (By Assessee) :
22\. It is the submission of the Ld. AR for the assessee that the cross
objection filed by the assessee in connection with the Revenue's appeal in ITA
No.572/PUN/2015 becomes academic once the Revenue appeal is dismissed on all
the grounds. We have adjudicated the appeal of the Revenue in the above
paragraphs and dismissed the appeal of the Revenue in its entirety.
Consequently, as stated by the Ld. AR for the assessee, we are of the opinion
that the objections raised by the assessee are required to be dismissed as
academic. Accordingly, the cross objections raised by the assessee is
dismissed.
23\. In the result, the cross objection filed by the assessee is dismissed.
14
ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
ITA No.352/PUN/2015 (By Assessee) :
24\. Before us at the outset, deviating from the specific grounds raised in
its appeal, Ld. AR for the assessee mentioned that the TP adjustments are
required to be deleted if three of the comparables which are considered by the
TPO while benchmarking the international transactions of ITES services
segment, are excluded. Naming the same, Ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted
that the AO/TPO included (a) Accentia Technologies Ltd. (2) Infosys BPO Ltd.
and (3) BNR Udyog Ltd. for arriving at Arithmetic Mean of the 11 comparables
of 25.35%. This is worked out against the assessee's Arithmetic Mean of 17.30%
(OP/TC). As per the assessee, the said 3 comparables are not to be considered
as good comparable for various reasons and therefore if the same are decided
accordingly the Arithmetic Mean of the assessee will be in the permitted range
of around 20%, which is within the range +/-5% qua that of the assessee. In
order to substantiate the same, the Ld. AR for the assessee went on arguing
about each of the 3 comparables to demonstrate that they are required to be
excluded from the said 11 comparables identified by the TPO. ACCENTIA
TECHNOLOGIES LTD. :
25\. Bringing our attention to the order of the TPO, Ld. AR for the assessee
submitted that with 41.35% revenue received from the Software services, the
said company cannot be considered as comparable. TPO rejected the said
contention of the assessee and the same is confirmed by the DRP and against
the assessee. The summary of the reasons provided by the DRP in rejecting the
contention of the assessee are as follows :
> "The company is offering BPO solutions in healthcare, financial and
> insurance sectors and is the first company to offer SaaS (Software as a
> service) model in healthcare receivable cycle management (HRCM) area.
> The company is a BPO and software as a service provider in healthcare
> industry.
15
> ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> Software designed for rendering the service and since the company is into
> HRCM, the billings and collection are from that area.
> Medical transcription is considered as a part of Safe Harbour Rules.
26\. Attending to the above referred reasoning given by the DRP, Ld. AR for
the assessee submitted the following written submission We proceed to extract
the same as under :
> "At Appeal PB-178 It was submitted that it renders medical transcription
> services, medical coding, medical billing, receivables management with
> respect to the Healthcare Receivables Cycle Management Sector. Further, the
> said company develops its own software products and owns intangibles in the
> form of Goodwill.
> Such software products are primarily the platforms required for rendering
> medical transcription services. The analysis demonstrated that Accentia owns
> such platforms and therefore would be distinguished from other medical
> transcription service providers. (Refer supplementary PB-467, 502, 505-508
> for relevant annual report extracts). Further at Supplementary PB-502, the
> annual report of the said company mentions on the Software as a Service
> (SaaS) model. It is evident from the above that the company is providing
> software solutions in the Healthcare Receivables Cycle Management sector and
> also that it has made acquisitions during the year to enhance its
> capabilities in SaaS. This clearly indicates that the company is into
> providing software services which is different to the services provided by
> the Appellant. Further at Supplementary PB - 547, the annual report of the
> company specifies software as generic principal product / service of the
> company along with services. The Ld DRP at Stay PB 56 also confirms that the
> company also rendering software services.
> Further, at Additional Supplementary PB 744, the website of the company
> clearly mentions of the software products that Accentia has developed for
> rendering healthcare services.
> Further, at Supplementary PB 467, 480, 516-518, the annual report of the
> said company mentions that it has diversified its business into rendering
> high end services like KPO and LPO which is functionally different from that
> of the appellant's business. The same is also evidenced from the fact that
> the company has dedicated management personnel leading the LPO services.
> At Supplementary PB-501, 503 and 504, mentions about acquisition of IQ Group
> of Companies which are engaged in the area of software product development
> and IT infrastructure solutions.
> At Supplementary PB 542 the company in its annual report mentions that it
> has made certain acquisitions in earlier years the effect of which has been
> given to financial statements in the current year. The company also mentions
> that because of the acquisitions, the financials are not comparable to
> earlier years, which evidences the fact that peculiar economic circumstances
> have affected its margins for the year.
> At Supplementary PB-536, in its annual report mentions that the company has
> developed / acquired significant Intellectual property rights ('IPRs') and
> the same is also evident from the Annual Report for the FY 09-10.
16
> ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> The Ld DRP has not rebutted the above contentions of the appellant in its
> directions.
> The appellant has placed reliance on the Hon. Pune Tribunal decision in the
> appellant's own case for AY 2009-10 (ITA No. 336/PN/2014) (Refer Legal
> Compendium Pages- 154 & 155) wherein it was held that the company was
> engaged in developing software products, extraordinary events on account of
> acquisitions and amalgamations and hence, warrants for rejection. Similarly,
> the Hon'ble Pune Tribunal in appellant's case for AY 2008-09 (ITA No.
> 2546/PUN/2012) has rejected Accentia on similar reasons. (Refer Legal
> Compendium Pages - 882 and 883) Reliance is also placed on the following
> case laws where the said company was rejected on account of functional
> dissimilarity.
> BNY Mellon International Operations (India) Pvt Ltd (ITA No. 23/PN/2014)
> (Legal Compendium Pages - 673 to 674) Maersk Global Service Centres (India)
> Pvt Ltd (ITA No. 2594/Mum/2014) (Legal Compendium Pages - 693 & 694) The
> Appellant further wishes to place reliance on ruling of Hon'ble Pune
> Tribunal decision in case of Aptara Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (ITA 259/PN/2015)
> for AY 2010-11 and Cummins Turbo Technologies Ltd (ITA 593/PUN/2015) for AY
> 2010-11 wherein Accentia was rejected because of extra-ordinary events
> during the year due to which the company is not comparable to the entities
> engaged in ITeS services. (Legal Compendium Pages - 894 to 896, 922 to 924 &
> 942 to 943) Given the above, the said company has a different functional
> profile/ revenue model compared to the appellant and has peculiar economic
> circumstances during the year. Hence this company is not comparable to the
> appellant's IT Enabled Services segment, and should be rejected.
27\. On hearing both the parties and perusing the said written submissions of
the assessee, amongst many arguments, we find that Accentia Technologies Ltd.
was not found to be a good comparable by the Tribunal in the assessee's own
case for the A.Y. 2008-09 and 2009-10 vide ITA No.336/PUN/2014 and ITA
No.2546/PUN/2012 respectively. For the sake of completeness, we proceed to
extract the relevant paragraphs from Page 154 and 155 and 882 and 883 of the
legal compendium :
> Extract from ITA No.336/PUN/2014 :
> "47. The next objection of the learned Authorized Representative for the
> assessee was with regard to the inclusion of M/s. Accentia Technologies Ltd.
> which admittedly was engaged in developing its own software products and was

> the year under consideration had made certain acquisitions which in turn
> affected the margins of the year of the acquisition. We find that Hyderabad

> Ltd.
> Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Capital IQ Information Systems (India)
> Pvt. Ltd. (supra) had rejected Accentia Technologies Ltd. for having extra-

> company had different functional profile as compared to the assessee, which
> in turn explained the abnormally high profit margins earned by the said
> company as compared to the assessee.Accordingly, we accept the plea of the
> assessee and hold that the said company is not to be used as comparable in
> ITES segments of the assessee."
> Extract from ITA No.2546/PUN/2012 :
> "26. Both sides heard. We find that the Co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal in
> assessee's own case in ITA No. 336/PN/2014 (supra) has excluded Accentia
> Technologies Ltd. from the list of comparables by observing as under :
> "47. The next objection of the learned Authorized Representative for the

> 27\. Further, on perusal of annual report of Accentia Technologies Ltd. for

> the decision of Co-ordinate Bench of Tribunal, Accentia Technologies Ltd.
> cannot be considered as good comparable. Therefore, the same is directed to
> be excluded from the final list of comparables."
28\. Considering the above stated position, we are of the view that the said
company is held to be not a good comparable and there is no change in facts in
this year also. There are extraordinary events exist in this year under
consideration as well. In our opinion, the Ld. DRP is not privy to the said
orders of the Tribunal as the Tribunal passed these orders subsequently  18
ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
posterior to the order of the DRP. Therefore, we are of the view that the
directions given by the DRP on this issue are required to be amended
accordingly.
INFOSYS BPO LTD. :
29\. The case of the assessee on this comparable include that the said company
constitutes a Giant company and deals with variety of functions and integrated
services. Considering the high brand value and the skill of operations the
said Infosys BPO Ltd. cannot be considered as comparable to the case of the
assessee. Referring to the various decisions including that of the assessee in
its own case for the A.Y. 2009-10 as well as in the case of Aegis Ltd. in ITA
No.7694/Mum/2014 for A.Y. 2010-11 the Tribunal held that on same grounds
Infosys BPO Ltd. does not constitute a good comparable. Relevant written
submissions in this regard are extracted as under :
> "In this regard, the appellant wishes place reliance on the following Hon.
> Pune Tribunal rulings wherein the Hon. Tribunal has held that where a
> comparable was included by the appellant in the TP Study Report and not

> In case of Aegis Ltd. for AY 2010-11 (ITA No.7694/Mum/2014) (refer Legal

> Motors India Engineering Pvt. Ltd. [TS-59-ITAT-2014(HYD)-TP] (Refer Legal
> Compendium Pages- 850-851)"
30\. From the above stated position, we are of the view that the orders of the
Tribunal in the assessee's own case and others stated above are not available
to the DRP at the relevant point of time. With the turnover of Rs.1,126
crores, the said company Infosys BPO Ltd. cannot be considered as a good
comparable to that of the assessee which recorded only around Rs.11 crores of
turnover. Considering the same, we are of the opinion that Ld AR's arguments
for excluding Infosys BPO Ltd. as not a good comparable has to be accepted and
in favour of the assessee.

ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt. Ltd.
BNR UDYOG LTD. :
31\. Narrating the facts relating to BNR Udyog Ltd. as not a good comparable
as the RPT filter is not justified qua that of the assessee, Ld. AR for the
assessee drew our attention to the written submission filed by him. We proceed
to extract the same as under :
> "The following is the summary of the reasons provided by the Ld DRP for

21
> ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software (India) Pvt.
> Ltd.
> 32\. Ld. DR for the Revenue relied heavily on the orders of AO/TPO.
33\. The TPO adopted the RPT filter of 25% in this year against the 10% of the
earlier year. Whereas the RPT of the said comparable (BNR Udyog Ltd.) is in
the range of 739%. This comparable was not considered a good comparable in the
yester year too. Thus, it is the case of the assessee that such comparable is,
not a good comparable for benchmarking the international transactions of the
assessee. Therefore, the decision of the DRP silently approving the TPO's
decision is not sustainable.
34\. Considering the above written submissions and the reasoning of the Ld.
AR, we find that it is evident from the records that the TPO ruled out the
filter on the Related Party Transactions at 25% and excluded this company as a
good comparable in the earlier years. Ignoring the same, in the year under
consideration, in violation of the principles of consistency, the TPO
considered the same as a good comparable when the RPT of the said comparable
has exceeded substantially the filter set by the TPO during the benchmarking
exercise. Therefore, we are of the view that the said comparable should be
considered as a good comparable considering the consistent stand of the TPO
over the years in the assessee's own case. Accordingly, the direction of the
DRP on this issue is required to be reversed and in favour of the assessee.
35\. Thus, our finding with the direction of the DRP is required to be
reversed on the comparability of the companies, i.e. Accentia Technologies
Ltd., Infosys BPO Ltd, and BNR Udyog Ltd. for the reasons discussed above.
Considering the said conclusions on these comparables, we are of the opinion
that Ld. AR's argument that the adjudication of other issues raised by the
assessee in the grounds becomes an academic exercise is accepted. Further, the
other aspects  22 ITA Nos.352, 572/PUN/2015 and CO No.38/PUN/2015 PTC Software
(India) Pvt. Ltd.
raised by the assessee are dismissed as academic. Accordingly, the grounds
raised by the assessee are partly allowed.
36\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
37\. To sum up, ITA No.572/PUN/2015 filed by the Revenue and the Cross
Objection No.38/PUN/2015 filed by the assessee are dismissed. ITA
No.352/PUN/2015 filed by the assessee is partly allowed.
