                                         ORDER
Per Shri M. Balaganesh, AM:
These appeals of the assessee arise out of the proceedings for the Asst Years
2009-10 and 2010-11 of the Learned Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) dated
24.6.2015 and 31.12.2014 respectively in which directions are given to the
Learned AO u/s 144C(5) read with section 144C(8) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). As the issues involved in both the
appeals are identical in nature, they are taken up together and disposed off
by this common order for the sake of convenience.

ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 ITA No. 1051/Kol/2015 - Asst Year 2009-10
2\. The assessee had raised a preliminary ground objecting to the initiation
of reassessment proceedings . Hence the first question to be decided in this
appeal is as to whether the reassessment proceedings have been validly
initiated and framed as per law in the facts and circumstances of the case.
2.1. The brief facts of this issue is that the assessee company filed its
return of income on 29.9.2009 and received intimation u/s 143(1) of the Act on
13.10.2010. No notice u/s 143(2) of the Act was issued on the assessee
selecting the case for scrutiny. However, a reference was made by the ld AO to
ld TPO who passed an order proposing an adjustment of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- to
Arm's Length Price (ALP) determined by the assessee. Since no assessment
proceeding was pending at that time in order to give effect to the order of
the ld TPO, the ld AO reopened the assessment by issuing notice u/s 148 of the
Act. In the reassessment proceedings, no fresh reference was made to ld TPO
u/s 92CA(1) of the Act for determination of ALP in respect of international
transactions of the assessee. The reassessment was completed by making an
addition towards ALP to the tune of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- as made by the ld TPO
and disallowance u/s 40(a)(ia) of the Act to the tune of Rs. 27,575/-. The
assessee filed objections before the ld Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP)
objecting to the validity of reassessment and on merits. The ld DRP disposed
off the objections vide its proceedings u/s 144C(5) of the Act dated 24.6.2015
stating that the assessee is not an eligible assessee as defined u/s
144C(15)(b) of the Act and accordingly the jurisdiction of the ld DRP could
not be invoked. Aggrieved, the assessee is in appeal before us on various
grounds. The principal ground revolves around objecting to the validity of the
reassessment framed by the ld AO by making an adjustment to ALP based on order
of the ld TPO u/s 92CA(3) of the Act which was admittedly made vide illegal
reference to ld TPO before the initiation of reassessment proceedings when the
assessment proceedings were not pending by way of selecting the case for
scrutiny. Apart from this, the assessee also preferred appeal on merits of the
addition made towards adjustment to ALP, among others.
3
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 2.2. The ld AR filed a chart reflecting the list of dates and gists
explaining the chronology of events from the date of filing the return till
the date of passing of final assessment order by the ld AO pursuant to the
order of the ld DRP. The various arguments of ld AR are summarized below:-
(i) The return filed by the assessee was not selected for scrutiny by issuance
of notice u/s 143(2) of the Act. Hence it could be concluded that no
assessment proceeding was pending at that time.
(ii) Without the pendency of valid assessment proceeding, the ld AO made
reference to ld TPO u/s 92CA(1) of the Act for determination of ALP . The
assessee co-operated with the proceedings of ld TPO.
(iii) The ld TPO passed an order u/s 92CA(3) of the Act on 29.1.2013
suggesting an adjustment to ALP to the tune of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- .
(iv) Since no assessment proceedings were pending, the ld AO did not frame any
assessment for giving effect to the order of the ld TPO.
(v) Later the ld AO issued notice u/s 148 of the Act by reopening the
assessment for giving effect to the order of the ld TPO.
(vi) The assessee complied with the reassessment proceedings .
(vii) No fresh reference was made to ld TPO u/s 92CA(1) of the Act in the
reassessment proceedings for determination of ALP.
(viii) The ld AO just adopted the adjustment to ALP suggested by the ld TPO in
his order dated 29.1.2013 (which was done vide illegal reference) and made
addition to that extent in the reassessment proceedings completed on
15.9.2014.
(ix) The assessee preferred objections before the ld DRP against the said
draft order of the ld AO contending the illegal reference made to ld TPO when
no valid proceedings were pending and the ld AO adopting the said adjustment
to ALP suggested in the old order us/ 92CA(3) of the Act and also objected
that no fresh reference was made to ld TPO in the reassessment proceedings.
Accordingly the validity of reassessment and addition made thereon to this
extent was objected to by the assessee apart from the contesting the issue on
merits.
4
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11
(x) The ld DRP passed an order on 24.6.2015 stating that the assessee is not
an eligible assessee as defined in section 144C(15)(b) of the Act and
accordingly the ld DRP cannot assume jurisdiction and directed the ld AO to
proceed as per law.
(xi) The ld AR argued that the entire addition of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- made in
the reassessment based on ld TPO's order , which was passed vide illegal
reference, deserves to be deleted , for which he placed reliance on the
decision of the co-ordinate bench of this tribunal in the case of Bucyrus
India Pvt Ltd vs DCIT in ITA No. 616/Kol/2015 dated 15.10.2015.
(xii) The ld AR also argued that in the reassessment proceedings, no fresh
notice u/s 143(2) of the Act was issued by the ld AO. However, this ground was
withdrawn by the ld AR during the course of hearing before this tribunal, for
which necessary endorsement was also made by him in the papers submitted
before us.
(xiii) The ld AR argued that since no reference was made to ld TPO in the
reassessment proceedings for determination of ALP, the ld AO ought not to have
passed any draft assessment order on 15.9.2014 and instead should have passed
the final reassessment order as is done regularly. Hence the reassessment
order passed by him is void abinitio and bad in law.
(xiv) The final order passed by the ld AO dated 8.7.2015 is bad in law in as
much as the ld AO failed to comprehend the facts and circumstances of the case
and apply the ld DRP's order in the proper legal perspective.
(xv) The ld AR argued by placing reliance on the provisions of section 153(2)
of the Act that reference u/s 92CA of the Act could be made only during the
course of assessment or reassessment proceedings. He placed reliance on
Instruction No. 3 dated 20.5.2003 in this regard.
Based on the aforesaid legal arguments, he prayed for deletion of the addition
in the sum of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- made in the reassessment.
2.3. In response to this, the ld DR argued that there is no requirement of
pendency of scrutiny of assessment proceedings for making reference to ld TPO
. It is purely in the discretion of the ld AO to refer the case to ld TPO for
determination of ALP. The  5 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage
Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 reference was made to ld TPO after
obtaining prior approval from the ld CIT. It is an admitted fact that
assessment could not be framed by the assessee by making an addition suggested
in the sum of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- by the ld TPO in his order dated 29.1.2013, as
no scrutiny assessment proceedings were pending on that date. It is an
admitted fact that no notice u/s 143(2) of the Act was issued and served on
the assessee in the original proceedings. However, that does not debar the ld
AO to make reference to ld TPO for determination of ALP. He argued that
admittedly, the order passed u/s 92CA(3) of the Act vide reference made to
him, suggested an adjustment to ALP in the sum of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- which
would constitute information enabling the ld AO to have reason to believe that
income had escaped assessment. Accordingly, the ld AO reopened the assessment
by issuing notice u/s 148 of the Act. Since the order of ld TPO is already on
record, the ld AO thought it fit not to refer the case again to ld TPO for
doing the same work in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and to reach
finality in the same at the earliest. This earnest intention of the ld AO
cannot be doubted with. With regard to the reliance placed by the ld AR on the
CBDT Instruction No. 3 dated 20.5.2003, he argued that the said instruction
exclusively relates only to ld TPO's order and not related to selection of
case for scrutiny. He stated that the said circular was replaced subsequently
in the year 2016. The assessee had not objected to the illegal reference to ld
TPO as it is evident that the assessee had duly cooperated with the ld TPO
proceedings. The decision rendered by this tribunal in the case of Bucyrus
India Pvt Ltd supra in turn relied on decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court
in the case of CIT vs SAP Labs Pvt Ltd in ITA No. 842 of 2008 and ITA No. 339
of 2010 dated 25.8.2014. In the case before the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court,
there was no return pending and hence no reference to ld TPO could be made. It
did not deal with pendency of scrutiny proceedings.
2.4. We have heard the rival submissions. The facts stated hereinabove remain
undisputed are not reiterated herein for the sake of brevity. We find that the
entire issue is squarely covered by the decision of this tribunal in the case
of Bucyrus India Pvt Ltd vs ACIT in ITA No. 616/Kol/2015 dated 15.10.2015
wherein it was held as below:-
> "4. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available
> on record. We find that the whole scheme of assessment proceedings have to
> be looked  6 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd.
> AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 into for deciding the case before us. Normally when a
> return is filed by the assessee, it would either get completed u/s 143(1) of
> the Act by receiving intimation from the Assessing Officer. If the case is
> selected for scrutiny by issuance of notice u/s 143(2) of the Act within the
> prescribed time, then the assessment would get completed u/s 143(3) or 144
> of the Act. Hence it is well settled that when no scrutiny notice u/s 143(2)
> is served on the assessee, the assessment would deemed to be completed based
> on intimation u/s 143(1) of the Act, if served on the assessee, or the
> acknowledgement of return itself would be deemed to be the assessment order.
Hence practically the assessment gets completed at this stage itself in the
belief of the assessee unless otherwise reopened by issuing separate notice
u/s 148 of the Act. The reference to Learned TPO for determination of ALP of
international transactions have been spelt out in the statute u/s 92CA of the
Act. For the sake of convenience, the relevant provisions of section 92CA(1)
is reproduced hereunder:- 92CA - Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer (1)
Where any person, being the assessee, has entered into an international
transaction or specified domestic transaction in any previous year, and the
Assessing Officer considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, with
the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, refer the
computation of the arm's length price in relation to the said international
transaction of specified domestic transaction under section 92C to the
Transfer Pricing Officer.
4.1. In this regard, the relevant Instruction No. 3 of 2003 dated 20.5.2003
issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes requires consideration. For the
sake of convenience, the said Instruction No. 3 of 2003 dated 20.5.2003 para 2
is reproduced hereunder;-
" In order to make a reference to the TPO, the Assessing Officer has to
satisfy himself that the taxpayer has entered into an international
transaction with an associated enterprise. One of the sources from which the
factual information regarding international transaction can be gathered in
Form No. 3CEB filed with the return which is the nature of an accountant's
report containing basic details of an international transaction entered into
by the taxpayer during the year and the associated enterprise with which such
transaction is entered into, the nature of documents maintained and the method
followed. Thus, the primary details regarding such international transactions
would normally be available in the accountant's report. The Assessing Officer
can arrive at prima facie belief on the basis of these details whether a
reference is considered necessary. No detailed enquiries are needed at this
stage and the Assessing Officer should not embark upon scrutinizing the
correctness or otherwise of the price of the international transaction at this
stage. In the initial years of implementation of these provisions and pending
development of adequate data base, it would be appropriate if a small number
of cases are selected for scrutiny of transfer price and these are dealt with
effectively. The Central Board of Direct Taxes, therefore, have decided that
wherever the aggregate value of international transactions exceeds Rs 5
crores, the case should be picked up for scrutiny and reference under section
92CA be made to the TPO. If there are more than one international transaction
with an associated enterprise or there are transactions with more than one
associated enterprises the aggregate value of which exceeds Rs 5 crores, the
transactions should be referred to the TPO. Before making reference to the
TPO, the Assessing Officer has to seek approval of the Commissioner / Director
as contemplated under the Act. Under the provisions of section 92CA reference
is in relation to the international transaction. Hence all transactions have
to be explicitly mentioned in the letter of reference. Since the case will be
selected for scrutiny before making reference to the TPO, the Assessing
Officer may proceed to examine other aspects of the case during  7 ITA No.
599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11
pendency of assessment proceedings but await the report of the TPO on the
value of international transaction before making final assessment.
The threshold limit of Rs 5 crores will be reviewed depending upon the
workload of the TPOs.
The work relating to selection of cases for scrutiny and reference to TPO on
the above basis in respect of pending returns filed for the assessment year
2002-03 should be completed by June 30, 2003".
From the aforesaid Instruction No. 3 of 2003 issued by CBDT which is binding
on the officers of the income tax department, makes it crystal clear that a
reference u/s 92CA of the Act could be made to the TPO only when the case is
selected for scrutiny. In the instant case, the case is not selected for
scrutiny which fact is also conceded by the Learned DR, and hence the scrutiny
assessment proceedings per se had not commenced. Hence we hold that no case
was pending before the Learned AO while making reference to Learned TPO and
accordingly, the order passed by the Learned TPO on 28.1.2014 making an
adjustment of Rs. 7,51,20,484/- to ALP is declared void ab initio and illegal
and hence cannot be relied upon by the lower authorities.
4.2. We place reliance on the CBDT Circular No. 549 dated 31.10.1989 which
states that if an assessee, after furnishing the return of income does not
receive a notice u/s 143(2) from the department within the prescribed time, he
can take it that the return filed by him has become final and no scrutiny
proceedings are to be started in respect of that return. In the instant case,
at the time of issue of notice u/s 92CA of the Act (i.e reference to TPO), no
return was pending on the basis of which notice u/s 92CA could have been
issued. We place reliance on the decision of the coordinate bench decision of
Pune Tribunal in the case of Maximize Learning Private Limited vs ACIT in ITA
No. 2234/PN/2012 dated 2.2.2015 for Asst Year 2007-08, wherein it was held an
assessing officer could make reference to the TPO u/s 92CA of the Act only
after selecting the case for scrutiny assessment.
4.3. We also place reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court in the case of CIT vs M/s Sap Labs pvt Ltd in ITA No. 842 of 2008 and
ITA No. 339 of 2010 vide order dated 25.8.2014.
" In this case, the assessee filed its return of income for Asst Year 2002-03
on 31.10.2002. The same was processed u/s 143(1) of the Act. The assessee
received notices daed 1.4.2004 u/s 148 of the Act and 12.4.2004 u/s 92CA of
the Act from the TPO seeking details about the international transactions
entered into by the assessee with the group companies on a reference made by
the Assessing Authority. At the time of issue of notice u/s 92CA of the Act,
no valid return was pending on the basis of which notice u/s 92CA of the Act
could have been issued. Since no notice u/s 143(2) of the Act was issued
pursuant to filing of the original return, the assessment is deemed to have
become final. In reply to the notice issued u/s 148 of the Act, the assessee
filed a letter dated 21.4.2004 requesting the Assessing Authority to treat the
return filed on 31.10.2002 as return in compliance with the notice u/s 148 of
the Act. Infact the TPO on 20.1.2005 passed an order u/s 92CA of the Act
accepting the pricing of the Assessing Authority. However, the CIT invoking
his power u/s 263 of the Act initiated proceedings and set aside the order of
the Assessing Authority on the ground that it is erroneous and prejudicial to
the interest of the revenue. It is against that order, the assessee preferred
an appeal to the Tribunal.
The Tribunal has held that when two views are possible and when the TRP has
accepted valuation by the Assessing Authority determining the arm's length
price, the commissioner had no jurisdiction to interfere with the said order
u/s 263 of the Act and moreover on the day the reference was made by the
Assessing Authority, there was no return pending for  8 ITA No. 599, 1051 &
617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 consideration
and therefore, the Tribunal has set aside the order of the Commissioner. It is
against the said order, the revenue is before this Court.
From the aforesaid facts, it is clear that on the day the reference was made
by the Assessing Authority to the Transfer Pricing Authority, there was no
return pending for consideration by him and therefore, the very reference was
bad. Even otherwise, the said TPO did not find fault with the adjudication of
determining arm's length price by the Assessing Authority. In those
circumstances, the Commissioner committed an error in exercising his power u/s
263 of the Act and the Tribunal was justified in interfering with the said
order. Therefore, we do not see any merit in appeal no. 842 /2008.
Accordingly, it is dismissed.
Consequently, the impugned order which is the subject matter of ITA 339/2010
which is a consequential order is also dismissed."
5\. We find that the Learned AO having realized his mistake of not selecting
the case for scrutiny sought to remain silent after receiving the Learned
TPO's order dated 28.1.2014. We find that notice u/s 143(2) was also issued
and served on the assessee in the reassessment proceedings. We find that in
the reassessment proceedings, no fresh reference was made to the Learned TPO
u/s 92CA(1) of the Act by the Learned AO. We hold that the action of using the
old TPO order passed u/s 92CA(3) as an information for forming his opinion of
reason to believe that income has escaped assessment within the meaning of
section 147 of the Act also cannot be appreciated for reopening the
assessment. In this regard, we find that the case law relied on by the Learned
AR in the case of CWT vs Sona Properties reported in 327 ITR 592 (Bom)
rendered by Bombay High Court is well placed. In the said case, the Assessing
Officer had made a reference to the Departmental Valuation officer after the
end of the assessment proceedings. Their Lordships held that such a reference
could not have been made under the scheme of the Act because the assessment
proceedings had come to an end before the point of time when such a reference
was made, and as such the reference itself was legally invalid. The stand of
the revenue was that even if reference to the DVO is to be held to be invalid,
the DVO's report constituted information and as such it could be a good basis
for coming to the conclusion that wealth has escaped assessment. Rejecting
this plea, their Lordships observed that . " a report called by an authority
having no jurisdiction would be a nullity at law and consequently proceedings
based solely on such report considering the requirement of section 17 would be
illegal and will have to be quashed." In effect thus, it is held that when
reference itself is invalid, the report received as a result of the said
reference cannot constitute material for forming the belief that an income or
wealth tax has escaped assessment.
The order passed by the Learned TPO passed pursuant to an illegal reference
cannot be used in the reassessment proceedings by the Learned AO as both the
proceedings are separate and independent of one another.
In view of the above, we hold that the reassessment proceedings initiated
based on the TPO's order dated 28.1.2014 suggesting an adjustment of Rs.
7,51,20,484/- to ALP (which was based on an illegal reference ) by the Learned
AO is void ab initio and bad in law."
In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and respectfully following
the aforesaid decision, we hold that the reassessment proceedings initiated
based on the ld TPO's order dated 29.1.2013 suggesting an adjustment of Rs.
2,43,53,752/- to ALP was based  9 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage
Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 on illegal reference by the ld AO and
is accordingly void ab initio and bad in law. Hence the entire reassessment
proceedings initiated based on such illegal reference and illegal order of ld
TPO cannot be construed as information which would have live link to the
formation of belief to have reason to believe on the part of the ld AO that
income had escaped assessment within the meaning of section 147 of the Act.
Hence we hold that no addition in the sum of Rs. 2,43,53,752/- towards
adjustment to ALP could be made in the reassessment. Once this addition goes,
then the very root of the reassessment proceedings also vanishes and no other
addition could be made thereon. Accordingly, the entire reassessment
proceedings deserve to be quashed in the facts and circumstances of the case.
2.5 In view of our above conclusion, we allow the ground no. 1 raised by the
assessee by declaring that the reassessment order of the ld AO is bad in law
and void ab initio. In view of this decision, the adjudication of other
grounds becomes infructuous and hence no decision is given on the merits of
the additions and on other grounds raised by the assessee.
2.6. In the result, the appeal of the assessee in ITA NO. 1051/Kol/2015 for
the Asst Year 2009-10 is allowed.
ITA No. 599/Kol/2015 - Asst Year 2010-11 - Revenue Appeal
3\. At the outset, there was a delay of 16 days in filing the appeal before us
by the revenue. In view of the concession given by the ld AR for condoning the
same, the appeal of the revenue is hereby admitted and taken up for
adjudication.
3.1. The ld AR stated that the tax effect in the appeal of the revenue is less
than Rs 10 lacs and accordingly stated that the appeal of the revenue is not
maintainable. In this regard, he stated that the ld DRP gave relief to the
assessee with regard to the working capital adjustments to be carried out
while determining the ALP and accordingly the difference in disputed income
thereon is only Rs. 11,78,977/-, for which the tax effect  10 ITA No. 599,
1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 would
be less than Rs 10 lacs. He provided the workings for Rs. 11,78,977/- being
the difference in working capital adjustments. Placing reliance on CBDT
Circular No. 21/2015 dated 10.12.2015, he prayed that the appeal of the
revenue is not maintainable. In response to this, the ld DR fairly conceded to
the fact that the tax effect of disputed addition was less than Rs 10 lacs and
is squarely covered by the latest CBDT circular.
3.2. We have heard the rival submissions. We find that the following workings
were provided by the ld AR before us to prove that the tax effect on the
disputed addition is less than Rs. 10 lacs :-
> Computation of TP adjustment based on original TPO order dated 30.1.2014
> Operating Cost Rs. 10,81,62,982 ALP @ 40.34% Rs. 15,17,95,929 Less: Sales
> with Non -AE Rs. 2,61,49,487 Sales to AE (excluding reimbursement of
> expenses) Rs. 11,54,80,823 TP Adjustment Rs. 1,01,65,619 Computation of TP
> adjustment based on revised TPO order dated 23.2.2015 Operating Cost Rs.

> 11,54,80,823 TP Adjustment Rs. 89,86,642 Difference in Adjustment due to

ITA No. 617/Kol/2015 - Asst Year 2010-11 - Assessee Appeal
4\. The Ground No.1 raised in the appeal of the assessee is stated to be not
pressed by the ld AR. The same is reckoned as a statement from the Bar and
accordingly the same is dismissed as not pressed.
5\. The first issue to be decided in this appeal is as to whether the ld DRP
is justified in partially upholding the adjustment to ALP made by the ld TPO /
ld AO in the facts and circumstances of the case.
5.1. The brief facts of this issue is that the Labvantage Solutions Private
Limited (" LVS India" ) and Labvantage Solutions inc. ("LVS US" / "AE") are
group companies as both  12 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage
Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 are directly or indirectly held by TCG
Lifesciences Ltd. LVS US is a global solutions provider that helps companies
optimize their laboratory productivity, and leverage the latest information
management and communication technologies in order to effectively share
analytical data throughout their worldwide organizations. LVS US is engaged in
development, marketing of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)
Software , testing and customer configuration services, provision of local
sales and customers support services. The proprietary software is
conceptualized and owned by LVS US. LVS India is engaged in the development
and customization of LIMS for its AE. The software development and
customization work is sub-contracted by LVS US to the assessee. The assessee
vis a vis the group is involved in the execution of the software development
and coding of software service ("software services") outsourced to it by LVS
US. Further, LVS India, in the domestic sector, caters to the laboratory
requirements of process industries, pharmaceutical companies and contract
laboratory organizations. It has licensed LIMS product called 'Sapphire' to
the domestic customers and has undertaken customization of the software for
these customers according to their requirements. It was submitted that LVS
India is independently responsible for rendering services to the domestic
customers. LVS Inc. is not involved in any manner for provision of services to
domestic customers. Thus, LVS India is also engaged in selling software
licenses to customers for which it pays a royalty to LVS US.
5.2. The assessee had following international transactions with its AE during
the financial year 2009-10 relevant to Asst Year 2010-11 :-
    (i) Provision of software design & development services            Rs. 11,54,80,823
    (ii) Payment of Royalty to LVS US                                  Rs.    72,84,012
    (iii) Purchase of Software from LVS Inc.                           Rs.     3,10,709
    (iv) Recovery of Expenses from LVS Inc.                            Rs. 1,03,31,396
    (v) Recovery of Expenses from LVS Shanghai                         Rs. 34,56,746
    (vi) Reimbursement of Expenses to LVS Inc.                         Rs.         715
Out of the above, the international transactions referred to serial (i) and
(ii) alone are subject matter of appeal before us. The assessee used
Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as the Most Appropriate Method (MAM)
with a Profit Level Indicator (PLI) of Net Cost Plus (NCP) Margin .
13
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 5.3. The assessee has raised the following grounds before us in this
regard:-
> "2. Determination of effective profitability of the Appellant from the
> international transactions.
> 2.1. The learned AO, DRP and TPO erred on facts is not taking cognizance of
> the domestic segment of the Appellant.
> 2.2. Accordingly, the learned AO, DRP and TPO erred on facts in including
> the expenses incurred towards domestic segment as part of the cost base,
> while calculating the effective Net Cost Plus Mark up ('NCP') earned by the
> Appellant from the international transactions with its Associated
> Enterprises ('AEs') 2.3. The learned AO, DRP and TPO failed to take
> cognizance that the "Domestic segment" of the Appellant is deemed to be at
> arm's length, since the same includes revenue from third-party customers
> under uncontrolled circumstances.
> 3\. Erroneous disallowance of the Royalty payment 3.1 The learned AO, DRP
> and TPO erred in determining the arm's length price of the royalty paid at
> 'NIL' while determining the amount of adjustment.
> 3.2 The learned AO, DRP and TPO also erred in not appreciating the separate
> benchmarking analysis done by Appellant, by virtue of which such payment of
> royalty by the Appellant to its AEs was determined at arm's length.
> 3.3 The learned AO, DRP and TPO erred in not appreciating that the Appellant
> did not pay any price to its AE for purchase of software, licensed to third
> party customers. Further, the Appellant was also allowed a license free
> period, wherein, the entire revenues generated from such sale was retained
> by the Appellant. Also, the updates in relation to such software is provided
> free of cost by the AE to the Appellant.
> 3.4 The learned AO, DRP and TPO erred in not taking cognizance of the
> benefits derived by the Appellant on account of such royalty payments.
> 3.5 The learned AO, DRP and TPO erred in making double adjustments on
> account of royalty payments by determining the arm's length price of such
> royalty payments at 'NIL' and also including such royalty payouts as part of
> the cost base while determining the arm's length price for the software
> design & development services transaction.
> 4\. Determination of arm's length price by the AO, TPO and DRP On the facts
> and circumstances of the case, the learned AO, TPO and DRP erred in
> determining the arm's length price undertaken by the Appellant with respect
> to software design & development services without appreciating the
> contentions, arguments, evidences and data put forward by the Appellant
> during the course of the proceedings before them and in doing so have
> grossly 4.1 Erred on the facts and in law in conducting a fresh benchmarking
> analysis using non contemporaneous data and substituting the Appellant's
> analysis with fresh benchmarking analysis on his own conjectures and
> surmises. Thus the Appellant prays that the fresh benchmarking analysis
> conducted is liable to be quashed.

> ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
> 2010-11 4.2 Erred on the facts in rejecting the comparable companies arrived
> at in the Transfer Pricing Study without considering the functional and risk
> analysis of the Appellant and the comparable companies.
> 5\. Erroneous computation of adjustment amount by the TPO 5.1. The learned
> AO, DRP and TPO erred in computing the adjustment amount at 14,776,387 by
> erroneously including the following:
> (a) Cost of domestic segment
> (b) Payment of royalty.
> 6\. Initiation of penalty proceedings 6.1. The Appellant submits that based
> on the facts and the circumstances of the case, there was no basis for the
> AO to propose to initiate penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(c) of the
> Act."
During the course of hearing, the ld AR stated that he is not pressing the
Grounds 4.3 to 4.11 before us, which was also mentioned in his written
submissions filed before us. Accordingly, those grounds (i.e 4.3 to 4.11) are
dismissed as not pressed.
5.4. The assessee had used TNMM as the MAM with PLI of NCP margin and arrived
at a set of 15 comparable companies with NCP margin of 14.79% vis a vis 44.94%
of the assessee from its Export segment. The list of comparables selected by
the assessee are as follows:-

                                                            Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11
5.5. The ld TPO ignored the segmental computation furnished by the assessee
and revised the NCP margin of the assessee from 44.94% to 30.94% by
considering the overall NCP margin for LVS India. He determined the ALP of
companies at 40.34% by conducting a fresh benchmarking exercise by selecting 9
comparable companies. The list of comparables selected by the TPO is as
under:-
    Sl.    Name of the Company                                       NCP
    No.                                                              (%)
    1      Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd                              33.25
    2      Kuliza Technologies Pvt Ltd                               30.75
    3      Evoke Technologies Private Limited                        18.75
    4      C T I L Ltd                                               19.56
    5      Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged)                    88.25
    6      E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd                                 71.92
    7      Thirdware Solutions Ltd                                   33.36
    8      Thinksoft Global Services Ltd                             17.35
    9      Inteq Software Ltd                                        49.91
           AVERAGE                                                   40.34%
5.6. While computing the adjustment of software services for LVS India , the
ld TPO inter alia included the following:-
> (a) Domestic as well as the AE cost for the software segment as total cost
> (b) Royalty expenses paid by LVS India (though separate adjustment for the
> same has been done)
> (c) The ld TPO considered the NCP margin of 40.34% as ALP margin and
> (d) Consequently made TP adjustment of Rs. 1,57,27,755/-.
Apart from the above, the ld TPL also determined the ALP of Royalty paid at Rs
Nil and accordingly made an adjustment of Rs. 72,84,012/- separately for this
transaction.
16
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 5.7. The ld AO passed a draft assessment order pursuant to the order
of the ld TPO. The assessee preferred objections before the ld DRP against the
adjustments made to ALP by the ld AO / ld TPO who disposed off the objections
by giving the following directions :-
(a) Sustained adjustment made towards Royalty of Rs. 72,84,012/-.
(b) Allowed exclusion of recovery transaction amounting to Rs. 1,37,88,142/-
for determining the TP adjustment and thereby an upward adjustment in respect
of software services provided to AE was made at Rs. 74,92,375/-.
(c) Allowed working capital adjustment and therefore recalculated the ALP of
TPO's comparables at 39.25%.
5.8. Incorporating the ld DRP's directions, the ld AO made a revised
adjustment to ALP of Rs. 1,47,76,387/- as below:-
    Upward adjustment for software development
    Service (Sales to AE)                                  74,92,375
    Upward adjustment for royalty                          72,84,012
                                                        -------------------
                                                         1,47,76,387
                                                        -------------------
6\. The ld AR stated that the main dispute lies here is in the selection of
comparables. He prayed for exclusion of the following comparables chosen by
the ld TPO :-
(i) E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd ; (ii) Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) ;
and (iii) Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd E-Infochips Bangalore Limited The ld AR
argued that this company is functionally not comparable to the assessee. He
argued that as per the annual report of the said company, the business profile
of the company is ambiguous as to the exact nature of the software services.
Further, as per the segmental reporting, the company is also engaged in
providing IT enabled services and no segmental income break up is available
for the same. Thus it would not be correct to  17 ITA No. 599, 1051 &
617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 classify
E-Infochips as a software development company. The ld AR stated that the ld
TPO had obtained information u/s 133(6) of the Act wherein they had stated
that they are only in IT sector, whereas their annual report states that they
are in IT and IT enabled services. In case of this contradiction, the
information available in public domain (i.e the annual report) should be
considered. He also argued that the section 133(6) of the Act information was
never confronted on the assessee in the show cause notice. It came directly
only in the ld TPO's order.
He also stated that in the following judgements, this comparable i.e
E-Infochips has been held to be functionally not comparable :-
(a) Hyderabad Tribunal in the case of Pegasystems Worldwide India Pvt Ltd vs
ACIT in ITA No. 1758/Hyd/2014 dated 16.10.2015 for Asst Year 2010-11.
(b) Ahmedabad Tribunal in the case of Allscripts (India) Private Ltd vs DCIT
in ITA No. 771/Ahd/2014 dated 5.6.2015 for Asst Year 2009-10
(c) Delhi Tribunal in the case of Headstrong Services (India) Pvt Ltd vs DCIT
in ITA No. 714/Del/2015 dated 18.3.2016 for Asst Year 2010-11
(d) Hyderabad Tribunal in the case of AMD Research & Development Centre India

vs DCIT in ITA No. 336/Hyd/2015 dated 19.2.2016 for Asst Year 2010-11 Infinite
Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) The ld AR argued that this company is
functionally not comparable to the assessee and it is having a different
business model. The company is engaged in providing entire gamut of solutions
comprising of technical consulting, design and development of software,
maintenance, system integration, implementation, testing and infrastructure
management services. Further it is stated from the records that the revenue is
primarily driven from technical support and infrastructure management
services. Further, as per the Annual Report of 2009, at Page 1, it is stated
that the Holding Company M/s Infinite Computer Solutions (India) Limited
signed an agreement (Build, Operate and Transfer Model) with Fujitsu Services
Limited to set up Global Delivery Centers in India to provide offshore  18 ITA
No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 delivery capabilities to Fujitsu & Fujitsu's associated companies.
Infinite Data Systems commenced its operations on 1st January 2009 and as per
segment reporting disclosure, the company's operations predominantly relate to
providing software technical consultancy services to its sole customer Fujitsu
Services Limited. The ld AR argued that these facts have also been
acknowledged by the ld TPO at page 77 of his order. Also, it would be
worthwhile to note that Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd completed its three
years contract with Fujitsu, post which, the business was transferred to
Fujitsu and thus the company has been merged with its Holding Company -
Infinite Computer Solutions (India) ltd during the financial year 2011-12.
The ld AR argued that the assessee company is a service provider in area of
software development whereas the comparable company Infinite Data Systems Pvt
Ltd was created for purposes of transfer of business. The services and
business model of assessee company and comparable company is entirely
different. He also argued that there exist abnormal circumstances in the said
comparable. During the last 3 years, variations in margins earned shows an
abnormal circumstances leading to huge fluctuations and supernormal profit ,
the margin earned by Infinite is 88.25% which is abnormally high. Such
companies which are making more than twice the arithmetical mean margin as
computed by the ld TPO should not be considered as comparable. The ld AR
referred to page 591 of the Paper Book where the details of the fluctuation in
the revenue, profit and margins has been provided. Accordingly, he prayed for
rejection of this comparable.
Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd The ld AR argued that this company is
functionally not comparable to the assessee. He argued that the said company
is engaged in software consultancy services which is not similar to assessee
business. The assessee is engaged providing software development services,
payroll services and corporate training services. The company executes turnkey
solution to its clients including onsite need assessment, feasibility study
and consulting services and off site development of the projects. Further,
from the perusal of the annual report for the year ended 31.3.2010, that the
software development expenditure amounting to Rs. 1,47,08,428/- are at 54% of
total expenditure amounting to  19 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage
Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 Rs. 2,71,86,621/-. Further, the ld TPO
had also mentioned in page 64 of his order that Eforce India (P) Ltd is
selected by the assessee is engaged into software consultancy service and
accordingly the same is functionally not comparable. He argued that applying
the same logic, Spry Resources also is engaged into consultancy service and
hence the same should not be treated as comparable.
6.1. He prayed for inclusion of one of the comparable chosen by the assessee
viz Akshay Software Technologies Ltd. He stated that ld TPO rejected this
comparable on the ground that it is functionally not comparable as it provides
technical support for integration of SWIFT software to its clients of the user
of SWIFT in financial industry. The ld AR stated that Akshay Software is a
company engaged in software development activities. The income schedule as
disclosed in the annual report of the said comparable clearly demonstrates
that the company is engaged in software services. However, the USA based
subsidiary of the company i.e Akshay Software International Inc. (Akshay US)
is a registered partner of SWIFT selling SWIFT solutions and products as an
extended arm of SWIFT in North America. Thus the contention of the ld TPO / ld
AO is erroneous since it is clearly evident from the annual report of the
comparable company itself that it is engaged in rendering software development
services only. The ld AR also placed reliance on the decision of Delhi
Tribunal in the case of Qualcomm India Pvt Ltd vs ACIT in ITA No.
5239/Del/2010 dated 10.6.2013 wherein Akshay Software had been clearly held to
be functionally comparable .
6.2. He argued that with the aforesaid exclusions and inclusion of comparables
with the list of other comparables chosen by the ld TPO, the assessee's margin
would be clearly justified to be at ALP and hence no adjustment need to be
made in the facts and circumstances of the case.
6.3. With regard to disallowance of Royalty payment of Rs. 72,84,012/- is
concerned, he argued that during the relevant year under appeal, the assessee
had paid royalty to its AE on the license sales made by it to the third party
customers as well as on the maintenance revenue generated from such licenses
earlier sold to third party customers. He argued  20 ITA No. 599, 1051 &
617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 that since
such payment was integral to the operations of assessee, and in the nature of
operating expenses, such transaction was aggregated with the provision of
software design and development services transaction and benchmarked using
TNMM as the Most Appropriate Method. Thus, owing to closely linked and
integrated nature of said transaction, TNMM is the MAM for its evaluation. He
placed reliance on the following decisions in support of his contentions :-
> (a) Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs EKL Appliances Ltd
> reported in (2012) 24 taxmann.com 199 (Delhi)
> (b) Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile
> Communications India (P) Ltd vs CIT reported in (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del) (c
> ) Delhi Tribunal in the case of AWB India (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2014)
> 50 taxmann.com 323 (Delhi-Trib.) 6.3.1. The ld AR argued that the ld TPO

> he again disallowed complete royalty thereby leading to double addition. In
> this regard, he placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
> Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India (P) Ltd vs
> CIT reported supra - relevant page is page 1327 of the paper book vide para
> 101 of the judgement 6.3.2. He argued that the ld TPO cannot use segmental
> activity for royalty alone but use entity level benchmarking for software
> development activity.
6.3.3. He drew the attention to the relevant page of the ld TPO's order where
the issue of royalty has been discussed and argued that the ld TPO had simply
reproduced the guidelines and determined the ALP of Royalty as Rs Nil, without
understanding the nature of activities of the assessee and the purpose of
payment of royalty.
6.3.4. The ld AR argued that the ld TPO has to apply any one of the 5 methods
prescribed in the statute for determination of ALP. In this regard, he placed
reliance on the decision of the Delhi Tribunal in the case of AWB India (P)
Ltd vs DCIT reported supra.
21
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 6.3.5. The ld AR drew the attention of the order of the ld DRP wherein
the assessee had explained the benefits derived by it through increased
turnover from the financial years 2004-05 to 2009-10 as below:-
    Year       Revenue      derived   Additional                           Benefit                Benefit % (on
               from Third party       benefit derived     Royalty                                 sales)

    2007-08    21,884,197             2,937,000           0                24,821,197             100%
    2008-09    16,050,097             6,007,496           7,133,376        14,924,217             68%
    2009-10    16,389,028             9173402             7,284,012        18,278,418             72%

The ld AR argued that the above table would prove that the assessee had
derived benefits of around 90% in terms of additional revenue and minimal / no
cost by virtue of paying royalty to its AE. He further argued that it would
not have derived such revenues from third party customers if LVS Inc. had not
granted such license to assessee. He further argued that under comparable
circumstances, no third party would have given such license free of cost or
allowed assessee to retain majority share of the revenue. He argued that there
has been increase in the revenues and profitability post addition of this
software sales and maintenance revenue. The details of the same are as below:-
              Financial Year      Revenues                  Profit before Tax
              2006-07             10,68,45,669              (94,71,976)
              2007-08             12,48,44,081              1,63,12,532
              2008-09             13,03,45,542              2,21,06,636
              2009-10             14,16,86,146              2,80,93,792
He argued that while this is so, the observation of the ld DRP, that the
assessee had not been able to establish how the payment of royalty to its AE
had improved its domestic sales, is without any basis. The long term benefits
derived by the assessee out of the royalty payments has been proved beyond
doubt by the increase in revenues and profitability of the assessee .
22
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 6.3.6. He argued that what is effectively carried out by the assessee
is only trading in software as far as this transaction is concerned. The
assessee bought software from its AE and sold it locally to third party
customers and 40% of it is given to the AE as Royalty. The fact that no
royalty was paid by the assessee for the first four years is in view of the
fact that it could get waiver from its AE for non payment of royalty. This
royalty admittedly is paid pursuant to the Royalty agreement entered into with
AE and which was also placed before the lower authorities.
6.3.7. The ld AR argued that without prejudice to the aforesaid arguments,
assessee had also conducted the benchmarking analysis for the payment of
royalty / license fees paid by third parties (licensee) to the licensor for
sub licensing of software. The average royalty / license fees details from the
benchmarking analysis is given below:-
    Sl. No.   Licensor                           Licensee                                 Royalty      Rate
                                                                                          %

    5.        Open Solutions Inc. (OSL)          BISYS, Inc.                              30.00

Accordingly he argued that the payment of 40% royalty by the assessee to its
AE is lower than the arithmetic mean of the royalty pay outs by the
comparables. Accordingly, it was argued that the payment of royalty is at
Arm's Length.
7\. The ld DR filed written submissions wherein he had stated that the CBDT
Circular No. 12 & 14 do not put any restrictions on the ld TPO. On the
contrary , both the circulars clearly state that if the ld TPO finds that the
data used by the taxpayer was not reliable or correct, then he can re-
determine the ALP. Hence the ld TPO rejecting the Transfer Pricing report of
the assessee and conducting a fresh search to determine the ALP cannot be
faulted with.
23
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 7.1. With regard to comparable sought to be excluded by the ld AR i.e
E-Infochips Bangalore Limited, on the basis of dispute on the exact nature of
services in which such comparable was engaged, the ld DR argued that the ld
TPO had obtained information u/s 133(6) of the Act wherein the said party had
replied about their nature of services which had to be considered as a direct
and authentic information. With regard to the argument of the ld AR that this
information sought u/s 133(6) of the Act was not shared with the assessee , he
stated that this argument was never advanced by the assessee before the lower
authorities and hence the same is to be rejected. Hence it has been rightly
chosen by the ld TPO as a comparable.
7.2. With regard to second and comparables sought to be excluded i.e Infinite
Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) and Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd, and inclusion
of one comparable i.e Akshay Software Technologies Ltd, he placed reliance on
the order of the ld TPO and accordingly stated that the same had been rightly
chosen as comparables by the ld TPO and rightly rejected by the ld TPO from
the comparables respectively.
7.3. With regard to payment of royalty, he argued that the fact as to whether
there was double addition was made due to entity level benchmarking may be
directed to be verified to the file of the ld AO.
8\. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials available on
record including the paper books filed by the assessee. There is no dispute on
the application of TNMM as the MAM with PLI of Net Cost Plus Margin. The
controversy that revolves around us is only on the selection of comparables.
First we shall address the dispute on account of Upward Adjustment in respect
of sales to AE in the sum of Rs. 74,92,375/-. The assessee chose 15
comparables to justify its transactions with AE to be at Arm's Length. The ld
TPO rejected 13 out of 15 comparables of the assessee and included several new
comparables and made upward adjustments to ALP. The ld DRP did not give any
relief to the assessee on the selection of comparables chosen by the ld TPO.
We find that the ld DRP had given relief only on the exclusion of recovery
transactions of Rs. 1,37,88,142/- for determining the TP adjustment and
granted relief on working  24 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage
Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 capital adjustment and therefore re-
calculated the Arm's length margin of ld TPO's comparables at 39.25%. We find
that the ld AR before us agreed to go by the comparables chosen by the ld TPO
in his order with the following exceptions :- Prayed for exclusions of
(i) E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd ; (ii) Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) ;
and (iii) Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd 8.1. We find that apart from this, the
ld AR had prayed for inclusion of one comparable chosen by the assessee i.e
Akshay Software Technologies Ltd in the list of comparables chosen by the ld
TPO. We find that the ld AR stated that if the aforesaid three exclusions and
one inclusion is carried out to the list of comparbles chosen by the ld TPO,
then the margin arrived in such arithmetical mean would be lesser than the
margins declared by the assessee and hence there would be no necessity to
dispute the other comparables of the ld TPO and consequently no adjustment to
ALP in this regard is required to be made. Hence the questions for our
consideration would be as follows:-
(a) Whether the assessee is justified in seeking for exclusions of three
comparables chosen by the ld TPO viz (i) E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd ; (ii)
Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) ; and (iii) Spry Resources India Pvt
Ltd , in the facts and circumstances of the case.
(b) Whether the assessee is justified in seeking for inclusion of one
comparable i.e Akshay Software Technologies Ltd to the comparables chosen by
the ld TPO, in the facts and circumstances of the case.
8.2. Exclusion of E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd We find that this company had
reported NCP of 71.92% . It is not in dispute that the assessee is engaged in
software development. Hence comparable should also be in the companies engaged
in the similar sector. We find from the business profile of the said
comparable as evident from its annual report, that it is engaged in IT and IT
Enabled Services. Even as per segmental reporting, the company is also engaged
in providing IT enabled services and no segmental income break up is available
for the same. Thus it  25 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution
Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 would not be correct to classify E-Infochips as
a software development company. We find that the ld TPO had obtained
information from this company u/s 133(6) of the Act wherein the party had
stated that it is engaged only in IT sector. Admittedly, the information
obtained u/s 133(6) of the Act behind the back of the assessee and not even
confronted with the assessee and came to the knowledge of the assessee only in
the order u/s 92CA(3) of the Act. In these circumstances, we find lot of force
in the argument of the ld AR that the information available in the public
domain i.e the annual report, should be taken as correct. Moreover, we also
find that the annual report is being circulated to the larger sections of the
public in compliance with the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and Listed
Company regulations prescribed by SEBI. We also find that the co-ordinate
benches of various tribunals had held that this company should not be treated
as comparable. The recent decision of the Co-ordinate Bench of Hyderabad
Tribunal in the case of CNO IT Services (India) Private Limited vs DCIT in ITA
No. 336/Hyd/2015 dated 19.2.2016 for Asst Year 2010-11 had held as under:-
6\. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the impugned orders
of the lower authorities and other material on record. As noted hereinabove,
the only grievance of the assessee in this appeal is against the inclusion of
the following companies in the list of comparables, for the purposes of
determining the Arm's Length Price.
(a) E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd
(b) Kals Information Systems Ltd
(c) Tata Elxsi Ltd (Seg) Admittedly, comparable nature of the above three
companies in similar circumstances, has come up for consideration before this
Tribunal in the case of Pegasystems Worldwide India Pvt Ltd., Hyderabad (ITA
No. 1758/Hyd/2014 of the assessee & ITA No. 1936/Hyd/2014 of the Revenue for
the assessment year 2010-11 , wherein the Tribunal has accepted the objections
of the assessee in that case against the inclusion of the above three
companies, after discussing the same in para 8, para 10 and para 12 of its
order dated 16.10.2015, extracted below-
> E-Infochips Bangalore Ltd 8.3. After considering the rival contentions and
> perusing the annual reports placed on record, we are of the opinion that
> this company cannot be selected as comparable company for TP analysis. First
> of all, this company is engaged in both software development as well as
> ITES.
Assessee being only captive service provider, the above company cannot be
considered as comparable on functional basis. Not only that, as pointed out,
segmental information pertaining to the above company is not available. As
seen from the TP orders, documents placed on record, TPO relied on later
year's annual report in extracting the information. Variation in profitability
over the years alone cannot be a reason to exclude the company from
comparability analysis but as rightly pointed, the absence of segmental
information, how much profit earned was on the software development or ITES
cannot be examined. In the absence of clarity on operational  26 ITA No. 599,
1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 details
and comparable company having diversified activities, we are of the opinion
that this company cannot be chosen as a comparable company in Assessee's case
in this assessment year. We are also aware of the decision of the Co-ordinate
Bench given in earlier assessment year on the reason that segmental reporting
was not available. Be that as it may, since the said company is functionally
different from Assessee's activities and in the absence of segmental
information, we direct AO/TPO to exclude the above while working out the
comparability analysis. We uphold the plea of Assessee in this regard.
We also find that as stated earlier, the other decisions relied upon by the ld
AR also had held that this comparable is functionally not comparable. We deem
it fit and appropriate to consider the recent decision rendered in this
regard. In view of the aforesaid finding and judicial precedent relied upon,
we hold that the comparable chosen by ld TPO i.e E- Infochips Bangalore Ltd is
functionally not comparable with the assessee company.
8.3. Exclusion of Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged) We find that this
company had reported NCP of 88.25% . It is not in dispute that the assessee is
engaged in software development. Hence comparable should also be in the
companies engaged in the similar sector. We find that this company is having a
different business model and engaged in providing entire gamut of solutions
comprising of technical consulting, design and development of software,
maintenance, system integration, implementation, testing and infrastructure
management services. We find from the paper book that the revenue is primarily
derived from technical support and infrastructure management services. We find
that Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd commenced its operations on 1st January
2009 and as per segment reporting disclosure, the company's operations
predominantly relate to providing software technical consultancy services to
its sole customer Fujitsu Services Limited. Further, as per the Annual Report
of 2009, at Page 1, it is stated that the Holding Company M/s Infinite
Computer Solutions (India) Limited signed an agreement (Build, Operate and
Transfer - BOT Model) with Fujitsu Services Limited to set up Global Delivery
Centers in India to provide offshore delivery capabilities to Fujitsu &
Fujitsu's associated companies. We find that these facts have also been
acknowledged by the ld TPO at page 77 of his order. The ld AR stated that it
would be worthwhile to note that Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd completed its
three years contract with Fujitsu, post which, the business was transferred to
Fujitsu and thus the company has been merged with its Holding Company -
Infinite  27 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY
2009-10 & 2010-11 Computer Solutions (India) ltd during the financial year
2011-12. We are inclined to agree with the submissions of the ld AR that this
Comparable Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd was created for purposes of transfer
of business. Hence the nature of services and business model of assessee
company and comparable company are entirely different. Apart from this, we
also find that there exist abnormal circumstances in the said comparable.
During the last 3 years, variations in margins earned show an abnormal
circumstances leading to huge fluctuations and supernormal profit , the margin
earned by Infinite is 88.25% which is abnormally high. It was argued that such
companies which are making more than twice the arithmetical mean margin as
computed by the ld TPO should not be considered as comparable. The ld AR
referred to page 591 of the Paper Book where the details of the fluctuation in
the revenue, profit and margins has been provided. It is true that where
company in which extraordinary events had taken place during the year like
major acquisitions which had impact on profits of company, it could not be
selected as comparable to assessee engaged in software development. We place
reliance in this regard on the decision of Hyderabad Tribunal in the case of
Excellence Data Research (P) Ltd vs ACIT reported in ( 2016) 74 taxmann.com 13
(Hyd Trib) dated 12.9.2016 for Asst Year 2010-11 , wherein it was held that :-

> find that the DRP has directed the AO to consider whether the extra ordinary

In view of the aforesaid findings and judicial precedent relied upon, we hold
that the comparable chosen by ld TPO i.e Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd
(Merged) is functionally not comparable with the assessee company.
8.4. Exclusion of Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd We find that this company had
reported NCP of 33.25% . It is not in dispute that the assessee is engaged in
software development. Hence comparable should also be in the companies engaged
in the similar sector. We find that this company is engaged in software
consultancy services which is not similar to assessee business. We find that
the  29 ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY
2009-10 & 2010-11 ld TPO while rejecting the comparable chosen by the assessee
i.e Eforce India (P) Ltd, had mentioned in page 64 of his order that the said
comparable is engaged into software consultancy service and accordingly the
same is functionally not comparable with the assesse which is engaged in
software development. Hence the ld TPO had consciously decided to exclude
comparables engaged in software consultancy services. Hence on this ground, he
ought to have engaged this comparable also i.e Spry Resources Pvt Ltd also
which is engaged in software consultancy services. In view of this, we hold
that the comparable chosen by ld TPO i.e Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd is
functionally not comparable with the assessee company.
8.5. Inclusion of Akshay Software Technologies Ltd We find that this company
had reported NCP of 10.38% . It is not in dispute that the assessee is engaged
in software development. Hence comparable should also be in the companies
engaged in the similar sector. We find that the ld TPO had rejected this
comparable on the ground that it provides technical support for integration of
SWIFT software to its clients of the user of SWIFT in financial industry. We
find from the annual report of this comparable enclosed in the paper book,
that it is also engaged in software development activity which is quite
evident from the income schedule of the said comparable. We find that the USA
based subsidiary of the company i.e Akshay Software International Inc. (Akshay
US) is a registered partner of SWIFT selling SWIFT solutions and products as
an extended arm of SWIFT in North America. Thus the contention of the ld TPO /
ld AO is erroneous since it is clearly evident from the annual report of the
comparable company itself that it is engaged in rendering software development
activity only. We find that this comparable i.e Akshay Software Technologies
Ltd had been accepted as comparable in IT sector in the Co-ordinate Bench
decision of Delhi Tribunal in the case of Qualcomm India Pvt Ltd vs ACIT in
ITA No. 5239/Del/2010 dated 10.6.2013 , wherein it was held that :-
26\. On perusal of the order of the Ld. T.P.O. , we find that the Ld. T.P.O.
has rejected Akshay Software as a comparable to the assessee for determining
the assessee's ALP on the basis that the Akshay Software is functionally
different to the assessee. He has observed that Akshay Software is engaged in
SAP and remote infrastructure management software applications, as against
design work on embodied software, DSP an integrated circuit  30 ITA No. 599,
1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11
hardware design and systems and also for the reasons that sales of Akshay
Software is only Rs. 6.21 crores against sales of Rs. 125 crores to the
assessee. We, however, find that the Ld.T.P.O in the assessment year 2007-08
as it is clear from the TPO order for the said assessment year made available
at Page No-69 of the paper book volume 3 , has accepted that Akshay Software
is comparable in the light of identical functions. On perusal of profit and
loss account of the Akshay Software, we find that Schedule -12 of it shows
break up of the sales of the company as Rs. 4,97,88,191 towards exports of
Software services, Rs. 1,17,29,263/- towards domestic software services and
Rs. 6,30,000/- towards sale of product. Under these circumstances, we find
substance in the contention of the Ld. A.R. that Akshay Software should have
been accepted as comparable to bench mark the international transaction of the
assessee also because in the assessment year 2007-08, the Ld. T.P.O himself
has accepted the company as comparable. We accordingly direct the Ld. T.P.O to
accept Akshay Software as comparable to determine the Arms Length Price of the
assessee.
In view of the aforesaid findings and judicial precedent relied upon, we
direct the ld TPO to include the aforesaid comparable i.e Akshay Software
Technologies Ltd as functionally comparable with the assessee company.
8.6. Accordingly, we direct the ld TPO to exclude above three comparables i.e
(i) E- Infochips Bangalore Ltd ; (ii) Infinite Data Systems Pvt Ltd (Merged)
and (iii) Spry Resources India Pvt Ltd and also direct to include one
comparable i.e Akshay Software Technologies Ltd with the list of other
comparables chosen by the ld TPO and determine the ALP of the assessee and
accordingly decide whether any adjustment need to be made thereon, in
accordance with law. Accordingly, the grounds raised by the assessee in this
regard are allowed for statistical purposes.
9\. Determination of ALP for Royalty at Rs Nil We find that the assessee had
paid royalty of Rs. 72,84,012/- to its AE on the license sales made by it to
the third party customers as well as on the maintenance revenue generated from
such licenses earlier sold to third party customers. We find that the assessee
had carried out trading in software by purchasing the same from its AE and
selling it locally to third party customers. We find in the instant case, the
assessee had paid 40% of its local sales as royalty to its AE. This is duly
supported by a Royalty Agreement which is part of the records and was filed
before the lower authorities. We find that the assessee had not paid any
royalty to its AE for the first four years in view of specific waiver obtained
from its AE for the same. We find that this payment was  31 ITA No. 599, 1051
& 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11 integral to
the operations of assessee, and in the nature of operating expenses, such
transaction was aggregated with the provision of software design and
development services transaction and benchmarked using TNMM as the Most
Appropriate Method. We find that the table mentioned in the arguments of ld AR
hereinabove would prove that the assessee had derived benefits of around 90%
in terms of additional revenue and minimal / no cost by virtue of paying
royalty to its AE. Admittedly, LVS Inc had granted the license to the assessee
for which royalty payment has been made, pursuant to which the assessee was
able to derive such revenues from third party customers. Hence the argument of
the ld AR that under comparable circumstances, no third party would have given
such license free of cost or allowed assessee to retain majority share of the
revenue, is well founded and deserves to be accepted. It is true that there
has been increase in the revenues and profitability post addition of this
software sales and maintenance revenue as detailed hereinbelow:-
    Financial Year         Revenues                Profit before Tax
    2006-07                10,68,45,669            (94,71,976)
    2007-08                12,48,44,081            1,63,12,532
    2008-09                13,03,45,542            2,21,06,636
    2009-10                14,16,86,146            2,80,93,792
Hence the benefit derived by the assessee out of payment of royalty has been
duly established by the assessee beyond doubt. We also find that the revenues
had also increased periodically with corresponding increase in Profit before
tax year after year justifying the payment of royalty.
9.1. We find that the ld TPO without appreciating the fact of increased
revenues for the assessee, had determined the ALP for royalty payment to AE at
Rs Nil. We are not inclined to appreciate the action of the ld TPO in
determining the ALP for royalty payment at Rs Nil. We place reliance on the
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs EKL Appliances
Ltd reported in (2012) 24 taxmann.com 199 (Delhi), wherein it was held that :-
> 22\. Even Rule 10B(1)(a) does not authorise disallowance of any expenditure
> on the ground that it was not necessary or prudent for the assessee to have
> incurred the same or that in the view of the Revenue the expenditure was
> unremunerative or that in view of the continued losses suffered  32 ITA No.
> 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 & 2010-11
> by the assessee in his business, he could have fared better had he not
> incurred such expenditure. These are irrelevant considerations for the
> purpose of Rule 10B. Whether or not to enter into the transaction is for the
> assessee to decide. The quantum of expenditure can no doubt be examined by
> the TPO as per law but in judging the allowability thereof as business
> expenditure, he has no authority to disallow the entire expenditure or a
> part thereof on the ground that the assessee has suffered continuous losses.
> The financial health of assessee can never be a criterion to judge
> allowability of an expense; there is certainly no authority for that. What
> the TPO has done in the present case is to hold that the assessee ought not
> to have entered into the agreement to pay royalty/brand fee, because it has
> been suffering losses continuously. So long as the expenditure or payment
> has been demonstrated to have been incurred or laid out for the purposes of
> business, it is no concern of the TPO to disallow the same on any extraneous
> reasoning. As provided in the OECD guidelines, he is expected to examine the
> international transaction as he actually finds the same and then make
> suitable adjustment but a wholesale disallowance of the expenditure,
> particularly on the grounds which have been given by the TPO is not
> contemplated or authorised.
9.2. We also find that this issue has been addressed by yet another decision
of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs Cushman and Wakefield
(India) (P) Ltd reported in (2014) 46 taxmann.com 317 (Delhi) vide order dated
23.5.2014 , wherein it was held that the authority of ld TPO is to conduct a
transfer pricing analysis to determine ALP and not to determine whether there
is a service or not from which assessee benefits and therefore, the ld TPO
cannot determine ALP of payments made by assessee to its AE at Nil taking a
view that assessee did not derive any benefit from services rendered by AE.
9.3. Hence we hold that the assessee had duly satisfied the 'benefit test' out
of payment of royalty to its AE. On that count itself, the deduction of
royalty payment does not deserve to get disturbed.
9.4. We also find that the assessee had also conducted the benchmarking
analysis for the payment of royalty / license fees paid by third parties
(licensee) to the licensor for sub licensing of software. The same is also
reproduced in the order of the ld DRP wherein the arithmetical mean has been
arrived at 43.75% . We find that the revenue had not disturbed the
benchmarking analysis and the comparables chosen by the assessee in their
orders. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the assessee had paid
royalty @ 40%. Hence on this count also, the royalty paid by the assessee to
its AE is at ALP.
33
ITA No. 599, 1051 & 617/Kol/2015 Labvantage Solution Pvt. Ltd. AY 2009-10 &
2010-11 9.5. In view of our aforesaid findings, we hold that the ld TPO had
erred in determining the ALP of Royalty payments at Rs Nil and accordingly
direct the ld TPO to allow the deduction for payment of Royalty as the same is
also duly benchmarked by the assessee which were not disputed by the revenue
and we hold that royalty @ 40% paid by the assessee is at ALP. Accordingly,
the grounds raised by the assessee in this regard are allowed.
10\. In view of our aforesaid findings on the specific grounds raised on the
upward adjustment made to software development activity for exclusion of three
comparables and inclusion of one comparable and our finding on the
allowability of royalty payment, we are inclined to accept the arguments of
the ld AR that other grounds become academic in nature. Hence they are not
taken up for adjudication and accordingly treated as dismissed.
11\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 617/Kol/2015 for
Asst Year 2010- 11 is partly allowed for statistical purposes.
12\. To sum up, Appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 1051/Kol/2015 for the Asst
Year 2009-10 is allowed.
Appeal of the assessee in ITA No. 617 / Kol / 2015 for Asst Year 2010-11 is
partly allowed for statistical purposes ;
Appeal of the revenue in ITA No. 599/Kol/2015 for the Asst Year 2010-11 is
dismissed.

initiated and framed as per law in the facts and circumstances of the case.

return of income on 29.9.2009 and received intimation u/s 143(1) of the Act on
13.10.2010. No notice u/s 143(2) of the Act was issued on the assessee

Arm's Length Price (ALP) determined by the assessee. Since no assessment
dismissed.
