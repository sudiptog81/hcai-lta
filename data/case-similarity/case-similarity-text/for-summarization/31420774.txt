PER BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER Present appeal has been filed by assessee
against order dated 30/08/2018 passed by Ld.DCIT Circle 6 (1) (2), Bangalore
Page 2 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 for assessment year
2014-15 under section 143 (3) read with 144C (1) of the Act, on following
grounds of appeal:
Based on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, Swiss Re Global
Business Solutions India Private Limited [formerly known as "Swiss Re Shared
Services (India) Private Limited"] (hereinafter referred to as - Swiss Re
India" or the "Company" or the "Appellant"), respectfully craves leave to
prefer an appeal against the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Income
Tax, Circle - 6(1)(2) (hereinafter referred lo as learned Assessing Officer"
or the "learned AO"), dated 30 August 2018 for the Assessment Year (A 2014-15,
under section 143(3) read with section 144C(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
("the Act") in pursuance of the directions issued by Dispute Resolution Panel
(hereinafter referred to as the "Hon'ble '_I DRV). Bangalore dated 23 August
2018 under section 144C(5) of the Act inter-alia on the following grounds ácta
are without prejudice to each other:
That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law:
1\. Impugned order of Ld.AO pursuant to directions of Ld. DRP, erred in
assessing the total income at INR 32.6034,282, as against returned income of
INR 15,70,57,200;
2 Ld.AO DRP and TPO erred in making addition of INR 16,89,77,082 to total
income of Appellant on pretext that price charged was lower than arm's length
price determined for Information Technology Enabled Services ("ITeS") rendered
by Appellant to its AE(s), 3 Impugned final assessment order passed by Ld.AO
is invalid being not in conformity with section 144C (13) of the Act 4 L.d.AO
DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by not accepting economic analysis
undertaken by Appellant in accordance with the provisions of the Act read with
the Rules, and in conducting a fresh economic analysis for the determination
of the ALP in connection with the impugned international transaction and
holding that the Appellant's international transaction is not at arm's length;
5 Ld.AO DRIP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by determining arm's length
margin/ price using only FY 2013-14 data though same was not available to the
Appellant at the time of complying with transfer pr.ong documentation
requirements;
6\. Ld.AO DRP and TPO erred in rejecting certain comparable companies by
applying the following quantitative and qualitative filters:
a) for having different accounting year (i.e. companies having accounting year
other than March 31 or companies whose financial statements were for a period
other than 12 months);
b) using employee cost greater than 25% of the total revenues as a
comparability criterion;
c) with export sales less than 75% of total sales;
d) applying only the lower turnover filter of less than INR 1 crore as a
comparability criterion and not applying a higher threshold limit for turnover
filter;
Page 3 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16
7\. Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by exercising his powers
under section 133(6) of the Act to obtain information which was not available
in public domain and relying on the same for comparability purposes;
8\. Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by considering the
provision of services by Swiss Re India to its AEs to be in the nature of back
office support services and technical services i.e. KPO services (as compared
to the actual activity being in the nature of back office support services).
9\. Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by accepting/ rejecting
companies based on unreasonable comparability criteria
a) Ld.AO, DRP and IPO erred, in law and in facts, by accepting the following
companies that cannot 1ke considered as comparable to the Appellant in law and
fact on one or more grounds:
> i. Infosys BPO Limited ('Infosys BPO") ii. Microland Limited ("Microland")
> iii. Eclerx Services Limited ("Eclerx") iv. Crossdomain Solutions Private
> Limited (Crossdomain) v. MPS Limited ("MPS")
> b) Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, by rejecting the following comparable companies
> selected by the Appellant in its TP documentation even though the companies
> are functionally comparable to the Appellant:
> i. Allsec Technologies Limited ("Allsec') ii. Informed Technologies India
> Limited ("Informed Technologies") iii. Jindal Intellicom Private Limited
> ("Jindal Intellicom") iv. R Systems International Limited ("R Systems") v.
> Datamatics Financial Services Limited ("Datamatics")
> c) Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, by rejecting the following comparable companies
> that were a part of the search undertaken by Id. TPO even though such
> companies are functionally comparable to the Appellant.
> i. Harton Communications Limited ("Hartron")
> d) Ld.AO DRP and TPO erred, by rejecting ACE Software Exports Limited ("ACE
> Software") even though the company is functionally comparable to the
> Appellant, on ground that it was additionally proposed to be included by the
> Appellant during TP Assessment proceeding.
Although some of the companies were chosen/ not chosen as comparables in the
transfer pricing study, r :ase upon consideration of more details being
available in public domain or subsequent decisions ay of such companies if
found to be not comparable for any reasons, appellant craves leave to urge am
sane at the time of hearing.
10\. Without prejudice to and in addition to above Ld.AO, DRP and TPO should
have excluded Infosys BPO, Eclerx and MPS from comparison considering that
income was earned by these companies by different business model of sub-
contracting work and secondly, and equally important that these companies are
recognizing revenue on percentage of completion method requiring complex
details that are not available in public domain to enable fair comparison.
Such reasons though not  Page 4 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16
specifically raised are conspicuous from audited accounts verified as part of
TP and DRP proceedings.
11\. Ld.AO DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by wrongly computing
operating margins of some of comparable companies considered in the TP order;
12\. Ld.AO DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by not making suitable
adjustment to account for differences in working capital position of the
Appellant vis-à-vis the comparables;
13\. Ld.AO, DRP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, by not making suitable
adjustments on account of differences in the risk profile of the Appellant
vis-à-vis the comparables, while conducting comparability analysis;
14\. Ld.AO, DRIP and TPO erred, in law and in facts, in determining separate
transfer pricing adjustment on account of the interest on outstanding
receivables amounting to INR 4,35,335.
15\. Without prejudice to our ground of appeal no. 14 above, Ld.AO, DRIP and
TPO erred, in law and in facts, by not appreciating that the outstanding trade
receivables from its AE's arise from the provision of IT enabled services
transaction which is to be considered as closely linked to such transaction
and should not be tested separately from arm's length perspective.
16\. Without prejudice to our ground of appeal no. 14 above, Ld.AO, DRIP and
TPO erred, in law and in facts, by re-characterizing the outstanding
receivables as on 31 March 2014 as a loan transaction.
17\. Without prejudice to our ground of appeal no. 14 above, Ld.AO, DRP and
TPC have erred, in law and in facts, by not providing the basis for arriving
at the arm's length interest rate of Libor plus 300 basis point for computing
notional interest to be charged on the alleged delay in collection of
receivables.
18\. Ld.AO erred, in law and in facts, by wrongly levying interest of INR
3,40,37,289 under section 234B of the Income Tax Act, 1961; 19 Without
prejudice to our ground of appeal no. 18 above, LdAO erred, in law and in
facts, by computing the amount of interest of INR 3,40,37,289 incorrectly
under section 234B of the Income Tax Act, 1961; 20 Ld.AO has erred, in law and
in facts, in initiating penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act.
Appellant submits that each of above grounds is independent and without
prejudice to one another.
Appellant craves leave to add, alter, amend, vary, omit or substitute any of
the aforesaid grounds of appeal at y time before or at the time of hearing of
the appeal, so as to enable the Hon'ble Tribunal to decide on the appeal in
accordance with the law."

5\. For year under consideration assessee used TNMM as most appropriate method
and OP/OC as PLI for computing its margin at 12.87% for ITES segment. For
comparability analysis analysis, assessee used following filters which has
been commented by Ld.TPO as under:

6\. In TP study, assessee used comparable is considering weighted average
margin of data for 3 years. Assessee used data pertaining to financial years
2013-14 and 2012-13 to be included for calculating weighted average of price
as per Rule 10CA. It has been submitted that, as per proviso to Rule 10B(5) at
the time of assessment proceedings, current year data 'shall' be used if
available. It has been submitted that current year Tata was not available at
the time of preparation of transfer pricing documentation.
                Sl.No               Particulars                   Margin

                         Arithmetic Mean                          13.37%
8\. Assessee thus computed arithmetic mean at 13.37% and as assessee's net
margin was 12.3%, the transaction was held to be at arms length.
Page 8 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16
9\. Ld.TPO did not accept the economic analysis undertaken by assessee and
conducted fresh analysis. Ld.TPO was of the view that arms length of
international transaction of assessee must be compared with financial
information of comparables pertaining to financial year relevant to assessment
year under consideration which is in accordance with requirements under Rule
10 B (4) of income tax Rules. Ld.TPO thus, applied following filters and
rejected certain companies selected by assessee in TP study:
 Companies for which current year data was available;  Comparables having
different accounting year (other than March 31 or companies whose financial
statements were for a period other than 12 months);
 Companies having a turnover less than INR 1 crore;  Companies having
revenue from IT enabled services less than 75% of the total operating revenues
as a comparability criterion;  Companies having related party transactions
greater than 25% of the total revenues as a comparability criterion;
 Companies having export service income less than 75% of sales as a
comparability criterion;
 Companies with employee cost less than 25% of turnover were excluded; 
Companies that are functionally different from the Appellant.
10\. Assessee during the Transfer Pricing assessment proposed to additional
comparables being, Harton Communications Ltd and Tech Mahindra Business
Services Ltd., as additional companies, which were subsequently rejected by
Ld.TPO. Final list of comparables selected by Ld.TPO are as under:
Page 9 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16
11\. The margin computed by Ld.TPO was 37.79% and thereby proposing adjustment
being shortfall at Rs.19,13,14,563/- in respect of ITES segment.
12\. Ld.TPO also benchmarked delay in receipt of payment for receivables under
weighted average method using LIBOR +300 basis points in respect of payments
beyond the agreed credit period of 30 days that worked out to be 3.3758%.
13\. Transfer Pricing adjustment proposed by Ld.TPO is as under:
Page 10 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 Aggrieved by proposed adjustment,
assessee filed objections before DRP.
14\. The DRP after considering various submissions advanced by assessee
included Tech Mahindra Business Services Ltd., in final list of comparables
and directed the Ld.AO/TPO to rectify factual errors in margin computation.
15\. Ld.AO, upon receipt of DRP directions computed transfer pricing addition
at Rs.16,89,77,082/-.
Aggrieved by order passed by Ld. AO, assessee is in appeal before us now.
16\. Ld.AR submitted that Ground No.1-2,4 are general in nature and therefore
do not require adjudication
17\. Ld.AR submitted that various issues, and has challenged various
comparables for in appropriate inclusion/exclusion in alledged grounds. It has
been submitted by Ld.AR that assessee wish to press certain grounds as under:
 Ground 5,6 (a), (d)and 7, 10 are against certain filters applied by Ld.TPO,
for exclusion of certain comparables.  Ground.9 (a) (i)-(v), Ground 9 (c) for
inclusion of comparable.
 Ground.12 for not granting of suitable working capital adjustments; and 
Ground.14-17 being addition made on interest on receivables.
18\. It has been submitted by Ld.AR that in respect of other comparables and
grounds, liberty may be granted for being considered in an appropriate
situation.
Page 11 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16
19\. Ld.AR thus restricted his arguments only to relevant grounds mentioned
hereinabove.
Ground No. 5 and 6 (a):
20\. These grounds are raised by assessee against not accepting weighted
average margin considered by assessee in transfer pricing study for computing
arm's length margin in case of comparables.
20.1. Ld.AR submitted that data in respect of comparables was not available in
most of the cases for financial year relevant to assessment year under
consideration at the time of compiling TP documentations. It has been
submitted that assessee therefore used multiple year data, which should not
have been rejected by Ld.TPO.
20.2. On the contrary Ld.CIT DR submitted that, multiple year data could be
used only from assessment year 2015-16 and therefore Ld.TPO was right in
rejecting the transfer pricing analysis submitted by assessee. He submitted
that assessee though objected for rejection of average of multiple year data,
during Transfer Pricing assessment proceedings, the Ld.TPO had called upon
assessee to file its response in respect of use of single year data, as per
Rule 10B(4). He submitted that assessee in response to the notice, suggested
new comparables for relevant assessment years, and therefore no prejudice is
caused to assessee.
20.3. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. Various arguments were raised by both sides in support of
their contentions.
Page 12 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 20.4. It has been noted that Rule
10B(4) casts obligation on assessee to conduct comparability analysis using
data for relevant financial year. Proviso to Rule 10 B (4) would apply only in
a situation where, Tata relating to relevant financial year reveals facts
which could influence determining transfer price. Further rule 10 B (5) gives
an option of using either of the method with the proviso that at the time of
determination of arm's length price of international transaction during the
course of assessment proceedings for relevant assessment year in the even data
for relevant financial year is available, then such data should be used
irrespective of the fact that the data was not available at the time of
furnishing return of income for relevant year.
20.5. As we analyse transfer pricing assessment proceedings, it is noted that
at the time of assessment, data for relevant assessment year was available,
which was used by Ld.TPO, as against average of multiple year data used by
assessee transfer pricing document. This in our view is in accordance with the
rules specified.
We, therefore, do not find any infirmity in analysis carried out by Ld.TPO by
using relevant year data.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands dismissed.
21\. Ground 6(d) 21.1. Ld.AR submitted that authorities below applied lower
limit of turnover filter of Rs.1 crore and ignored applying an upper turnover
filter. It was submitted that, consistently revenue always took stand that
turnover is not a relevant filter in software industry. It has been contended
by revenue that in software  Page 13 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015
- 16 industry size has no influence on the margins earned by a comparable
company. What matters is a human capital. It was under these circumstances
that Ld.TPO applied only lower limit of turnover filter for excluding
companies having turnover less than Rs.1 crore.
21.2. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us.
We note that Ld.AO/TPO has applied filter of more than Rs.1 crore but did not
put an upper limit to the filter. This Tribunal in case of Genesis Integrating
Systems India Pvt Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2012) 53 SOT 159 and various other
decisions have held that, companies having turnover in excess of 200 crores
cannot be compared with companies having turnover less than Rs.200 crore. This
preposition has been accepted by Hon'ble Bombay High Court in case of CIT vs
Pentair Water Pvt.Ltd., by order dated 16/09/2015 in ITA No. 18/2015. Hon'ble
court upheld rejection of companies having turnover holding that turnover is a
relevant factor in considering comparability of companies.
21.3. The objection raised by Ld.CIT.DR by placing reliance upon decision of
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of Chris Capital (supra) has been dealt with
by this Tribunal in case of Autodesk India Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT in (2018) 96
taxmann.com 263 for assessment year 2005-06. This Tribunal reviewed gamut of
case laws to consider, whether companies having turnover should be regarded as
comparable with a company having turnover less than Rs.200 crore.
Page 14 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 21.4. Most of the decisions of this
Tribunal are in favour of opting for limit at lower-end of 1/10 and upper side
of 10 times of turnover of comparables under consideration of TP benchmarking.
Considering the fact that, present year under consideration is 2015-16,
turnover limit of companies for being tested under this filter should be lower
side turnover of 1/10 to turnover of 10 times would be appropriate. Thus, in
our view also, testing comparable with 10 times below and 10 times above the
turnover of the assessee, appears appropriate. Only restriction is that such
comparables also should be functionally comparable with assessee. In our view,
turnover filter would vary from company to company depending on functional
comparability.
21.5. This view originates from decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal
in case of ACIT Vs. M/s McAfee Software (India) Pvt. Ltd., reported in (2016)
68 taxmann.com 293. Relevant observation in this decision is as under :--
"8. Generally, a turnover filter is adopted to avoid selection of high end
companies (big companies) with that of 'minnows' in the similar line of
business. How to adopt the filter depends on each case. Say for example, in
the TP analysis of a company having 20 Crores receipts, a company with 2
Crores to 200 Crores can be stated to be within the range i.e., factor of ten
as upper and lower limits. In certain cases, the ITAT also accepted turnover
filter of 1 Crore to 200 Crores. But the range cannot be fixed, as the facts
may vary from case to case. Simply a comparable can not be excluded on upper
turnover limit when infact in number of cases Assessees do not raise any
objection on inclusion of companies with very small turnover. The 200 Crores
upper limit also cannot be considered in a case whose turnover is, say 300
Crores. Therefore, instead of a fixed 1cr - 200 Crore range, what one has to
consider is the turnover /receipts of Assessee and range of upper limit at ten
times and lower limit also ten times..i.e.,one tenth. Thus, for example the
range for a 300 Crores company can be from 30 Crores (1/10th) to 3000 Crores
(Ten times). Even this has some limitations."
Page 15 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 21.6. Thus, we are of the view that
for as assessee before us has turnover of Rs.98.25 crores so, turnover filter
of Rs.9 crores on lower side to Rs.980 crores on upper side, should be
considered provided the functional similarities stands satisfied. We note that
companies that have been pointed out by assessee is very large company that
has turnover more than Rs.1000 crores. Assessee has been categorised to be a
captive service provider having turnover of 98.25 crores. Further it is noted
that assessee do not own any intangibles whereas, the company alleged for
exclusion by assessee by applying turnover filter owns huge brand, holding
invaluable intangibles and are engaged in diversified activities. We therefore
are of opinion that turnover is a valid filter for assessing comparability.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed.
22\. Ground 9 (a) and 9 (c), Ground 10 A. Assessee is seeking exclusion of;
 Infosys BPO Ltd.
 Microland Ltd  Eclerx services Ltd  Crossdomain solutions Pvt.Ltd.
 MPS Ltd.
B. Assessee is seeking inclusion of;
 Harton communications Ltd 22.1. Before we undertake comparability analysis,
it is sine qua non to understand functions performed, assets employed and
risks assumed by assessee under this segment.

III. Assets employed:

    IV.    Characterisation:
    Based    on    the    above     FAR     analysis,   assessee     has   been
    characterised    to    be     operating    under    the   risk    mitigated
environment and does not carry significant entrepreneurial activities, nor
does it bears significant risk, associated with such activities. It is also
noted that assessee is remunerated on cost to cost basis for services rendered
to associated enterprises. A. Seeking exclusion of:
a) Infosys BPO Ltd.
Ld.AR submitted that this company was selected as comparable by Ld.TPO, though
was objected by assessee before authorities below. It has been submitted that
this comparable has been selected by Ld.TPO only for the reason that this
company is into sub contracting. It has been submitted that this comparable
has ownership of huge intangibles, has a brand value. Ld.AR submitted that
this company is functionally different with that of assessee as it provides
services in diversified activities in the area of analytics, legal process
outsourcing etc. It has been submitted that this company also provides
management services, consultancy and end to end outsourcing. It is also been
Page 18 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 submitted that this
company is one of the leading companies in ITES segment having huge turnover
of about Rs.2309 crores. On the contrary Ld. CIT DR placed reliance upon
orders passed by authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us. We note that this company is providing services in various areas of
sourcing and procurement, customer services, finance and accounting legal
process outsourcing, sales and fulfilment, analytics, business platforms,
business transformation services, human resource outsourcing and technology
solution optimisation. It is noted that this comparable also provides services
in financial services and insurance, manufacturing, energy utilities
communications and services and retail, consumer packaged foods, logistics and
life services. Further in the annual report it has been mentioned that this
comparable provides services that are different from routine back office
services. This noting itself makes this comparable not functionally similar
with that of assessee. Accordingly we direct this comparable to be excluded
from finalist.
b) Microland Ltd This company was selected by Ld.TPO despite various
objections raised by assessee. Ld.AR submitted that this comparable money is
functionally not similar with that of assessee, as it is involved in providing
cloud computing related services and provides high end ITES services. Ld.AR
also submitted that this company is engaged in infrastructure management
services also. Further it  Page 19 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 -
16 has been submitted that Ld.TPO considered this comparable at entity level
without looking into the segmental details. On the contrary, Ld.CIT.DR
submitted that, assessee has admitted before DRP in its submission that ITES
segment of this comparable should be considered. He thus submitted for the
comparable to be set aside to Ld.TPO for verification. We have perused
submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed before us.
Admittedly, it is observed that, this comparable has 2 segments, one being
infrastructure management service segment and IT enabled service segment. Both
DRP as well as Ld.TPO considered revenue generated by this comparable at
entity level, instead of considering segmental revenue under ITES service
segment. We therefore set aside this comparable back to Ld.AO/TPO with a
direction to consider this comparable having regards to the segmental revenue
generated under ITES segment in accordance with law. Needless to say that
proper opportunity of being heard to be provided to assessee.
Accordingly this comparable is set aside to Ld.AO/TPO.
c) Eclerx Services Ltd This comparable was selected by Ld.TPO by observing
that it is functionally similar with that of assessee. Ld.AR submitted that
this company provides digital marketing services to largest
Fortune/FT/Internet retailer 500 scale companies augmenting bandwidth to drive
greater quality control to that digital operations, data management and
analytical. It has also been submitted that there is no segmental details
available and this company reveals operating income only under only one
segment,  Page 20 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 which is data
analytics and process outsourcing services. It has been submitted by Ld.AR
that, services rendered by this company is in the nature of KPO and is one of
India's first publicly listed KPO company. It is also been submitted by Ld.AR
that this company is into sub contracting.
On the contrary, Ld.CIT.DR submitted that assessee had not argued regarding
sub contracting, before DRP or before Ld.TPO. We have perused submissions
advanced by both sides in light of records placed before us.
It is noted that this company is involved in high-end KPO services whereas
assessee is providing IT enabled services by rendering remote data processing
in the field of reinsurance. In our opinion functions performed by this
company is not similar to that of assessee even though assessee before us also
carries out certain services on contract basis. Ld.AR has placed reliance upon
decision of Hon'able Delhi High Court in case of Rampgreen Solutions Ltd.
vs.CIT, reported in [2015] 60 taxmann.com 355 Hon'ble court had held that once
a company falls into the category of high-end KPO, it cannot be functionally
comparable with a BPO service provider like that of assessee. Applying this
reissue in the present case, we direct Ld.AO to eliminate this comparable from
final list.
d) Crossdomain Solutions Pvt.Ltd.
Ld.AR submitted that this comparable was considered by Ld.TPO. It has been
submitted that Ld.TPO used information in under section 133 (6) which was not
made available to assessee. Ld. CIT DR submitted that the details collected
under 133 (6) was provided to assessee in soft copy for its comments.
Page 21 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 Ld.AR as rejoinder submitted that CD
was provided to assessee however the information was contrary to the details
available in public domain. He submitted that assessee had requested for cross
examination of the person who had provided the information under section 133
(6) that was denied by Ld. TPO. He thus submitted that due process of law has
not been followed by Ld.TPO.
Considering the arguments advanced by both sides, we are of opinion that the
comparable must be set aside to Ld.AO/TPO for reconsideration. Assessee has
filed various details before us showing functional dissimilarities whereas
Ld.TPO is said to have information from the comparable under section 133 (6).
It is also noted that Ld.TPO has not dealt with objections raised by assessee.
We direct Ld.AO/TPO to consider all objections raised by assessee in respect
of this company and to verify details in respect of this comparable in
accordance with law. Needless to say that assessee shall be granted proper
opportunity of being heard in accordance with law.
Accordingly this comparable is set aside to Ld.AO/TPO for edification.
e) MPS Ltd.
It was submitted that, assessee provided this additional comparable to Ld.TPO
during Transfer Pricing assessment proceedings. Ld.AR submitted that initially
Ld.TPO rejected this comparable on the ground that it fails service income to
sales being less than 75% filter. Subsequently Ld.TPO in the notice held this
comparable to be functionally similar to assessee and  Page 22 of 31 IT(TP)A
3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 passing all filters. Ld.AR submitted that this
comparable did not appear in the search process undertaken by Ld.TPO. It has
now been submitted by Ld.AR that this company holds huge inventory is part of
its business and only has one business segment of providing publishing
solutions i.e; typesetting and data digitization. Ld.AR placed reliance on
screenshots in respect of this company placed in paper book providing brief
facts and submissions at page 71.
On the contrary, Ld. CIT DR submitted that assessee has raised various issues
of exceptionally year of operations and acquisitions by this company during
the year under consideration which has not been considered by Ld.TPO. He thus
requested for this comparable to be set-aside to Ld.TPO for due verification
as this comparable is also into back-office support services like assessee.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us. It is noted that various objections raised by the Ld.AR before us
for exclusion of this comparable has not been considered by authorities below.
Under such circumstances it is necessary that proper verification in respect
of functions performed, assets owned and risk assumed by this comparable needs
to be verified for analysing comparability with that of assessee. Assessee is
directed to provide all relevant details/information regarding this comparable
to Ld.AO/TPO. Ld.AO/TPO shall then verify all details filed by assessee and
then decide upon the comparability based upon FAR analysis with assesssee.
Needless to say that, proper opportunity of being heard shall be granted to
assessee in accordance with law.
Page 23 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 Accordingly this comparable is set
aside to Ld.AO/TPO. B. Alleged for inclusion
a) Hartron Communications Ltd:
It has been submitted that, Ld.TPO/DRP rejected this comparable, as it was
persistent loss making company and has incurred losses in BPO segment in two
years, out of preceding 3 years. Ld.AR submitted that relevant segmental
detail only was to be considered, whereas, Ld.TPO considered revenue earned by
this comparable on entity level. It has been submitted that, this crucial
objection raised by assessee, has not been considered by authorities below. In
support of, Ld.AR placing reliance on decision of Pune Tribunal in case of
Yazaki India Pvt Ltd vs DCIT in ITA No.621/Pun/2014 for assessment year
2009-10 by order dated 11/07/2019.
On the contrary Ld.CIT.DR placed reliance on observations of authorities
below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
It is observed that this comparable has not been verified by Ld.AO/TPO having
regards to the submissions made by assessee. We therefore, direct Ld.AO/TPO to
verify this comparable in the light of observations by Pune Tribunal in case
of Yazaki India Pvt Ltd vs DCIT (supra). Needless to say that proper
opportunity of being heard must be granted to assessee in accordance with law.
Accordingly this comparable is set aside to Ld.AO/TPO. Ground No. 12:
It has been submitted that working capital adjustment was denied while
computing the margin on the ground that assessee  Page 24 of 31 IT(TP)A
3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 has not been able to demonstrate the
differences that had impacted the profit.
Various decisions of coordinate bench of this tribunal has time and again
directed authorities below to provide working capital adjustment in actuals
which is in accordance with rule 10 B (1)
(e) of the rules.
22.2. We therefore direct Ld.AO/TPO to recompute working capital adjustment in
actuals to the selected comparables to make them comparable with assessee.
Accordingly, this ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
23\. Ground No.14-17 alleged by assessee against adjustment of notional
interest on outstanding receivables. From TP study, it is observed that
payments to assessee are not contingent upon payment received by AEs from
their respective customers. Further Ld.AR submitted that working capital
adjustment undertaken by assessee includes the adjustment regarding the
receivables and thus receivables arising out of such transaction have already
been accounted for. Alternatively, he submitted that working capital subsumes
sundry creditors and therefore separate addition is not called for. 23.1.
Ld.TPO computed interest on outstanding receivables under weighted average
method using LIBOR + 300 basis points applicable for year under consideration
that worked out to 3.3758% on receivables that exceeded 30 days. It has been
argued by Ld.AR that authorities below disregarded business/commercial
arrangement between the assessee and its  Page 25 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018
A. Y : 2015 - 16 AE's, by holding outstanding receivables to be an independent
international transaction.
23.2. Ld.AR placed reliance on decision of Delhi Tribunal in Kusum Healthcare
Pvt.Ltd vs. ACIT reported in (2015) 62 Taxmann.com 79, deleted addition by
considering the above principle, and subsequently Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
Pr. CIT vs. Kusum Health Care Pvt. Ltd. (2017) 398 ITR 66 (Del), held that no
interest could have been charged as it cannot be considered as international
transaction. He also placed reliance upon decision of Delhi Tribunal in case
of Bechtel India vs DCIT reported in (2016) 66 taxman.com 6 which subsequently
upheld by Hon'able Delhi High Court vide order dated 21/07/16 in ITA No.
379/2016, also upheld by Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 21/07/17, in
CC No. 4956/2017.
23.3. It has been submitted by Ld.AR that outstanding receivables are closely
linked to main transaction and so the same cannot be considered as separate
international transaction. He also submitted that into company agreements
provides for extending credit period with mutual consent and it does not
provide any interest clause in case of delay. He also argued that the working
capital adjustment takes into account the factors related to delayed
receivables and no separate adjustment is required in such circumstances.
23.4. On the contrary Ld.CIT.DR submitted that interest on receivables is an
international transaction and Ld.TPO rightly determined its ALP. In support of
the contentions, he placed reliance on decision of Delhi Tribunal order in
Ameriprise India  Page 26 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 Pvt.
Ltd. vs. ACIT (2015- TII-347-ITAT-DEL-TP) wherein it is held that, interest on
receivables is an international transaction and the transfer pricing
adjustment is warranted. He stated that Finance Act, 2012 inserted Explanation
to Section 92B, with retrospective effect from 1.4.2002 and sub-clause (c) of
clause (i) of this Explanation provides that:
(i) the expression "international transaction" shall include--
> ...... (c) capital financing, including any type of long-term or short-term
> borrowing, lending or guarantee, purchase or sale of marketable securities
> or any type of advance, payments or deferred payment or receivable or any
> other debt arising during the course of business;....' .
23.5. Ld.CIT.DR submitted that expression 'debt arising during the course of
business' refers to trading debt arising from sale of goods or services
rendered in course of carrying on business. Once any debt arising during
course of business is an international transaction, he submitted that any
delay in realization of same needs to be considered within transfer pricing
adjustment, on account of interest income short charged or uncharged. It was
argued that insertion of Explanation with retrospective effect covers
assessment year under consideration and hence under/non-payment of interest by
AEs on debt arising during course of business becomes international
transactions, calling for computing its ALP. He referred to decision of Delhi
Tribunal in Ameriprise (supra), in which this issue has been discussed at
length and eventually interest on trade receivables has been held to be an
international transaction. Referring to discussion in said order, it was
stated that Hon'ble Delhi Bench in this case noted a decision of the  Page 27
of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the
case of CIT vs. Patni Computer Systems Ltd., (2013) 215 Taxmann 108 (Bom.),
which dealt with question of law:
> "(c) `Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Tribunal did not err in holding that the loss suffered by the assessee by
> allowing excess period of credit to the associated enterprises without
> charging an interest during such credit period would not amount to
> international transaction whereas section 92B(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961
> refers to any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income,
> losses or assets of such enterprises?"
23.6. Ld.CIT.DR submitted that, while answering above question, Hon'ble Bombay
High Court referred to amendment to section 92B by Finance Act, 2012 with
retrospective effect from 1.4.2002. Setting aside view taken by Tribunal,
Hon'ble Bombay High Court restored the issue to file of Tribunal for fresh
decision in light of legislative amendment. It was thus argued that non/under-
charging of interest on excess period of credit allowed to AEs for realization
of invoices, amounts to an international transaction and ALP of such
international transaction has to be determined by Ld.TPO. In so far as
charging of rate of interest is concerned, he relied on decision of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in CIT vs. Cotton Naturals (I) Pvt. Ltd (2015) 276
CTR 445 (Del) holding that currency in which such amount is to be re-paid,
determines rate of interest. He, therefore, concluded by summing up that
interest on outstanding trade receivables is an international transaction and
its ALP has been correctly determined.
23.7. We have perused the submissions advanced by both the sides in the light
of the records placed before us.
Page 28 of 31
IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y : 2015 - 16 This Bench referred to decision of
Special Bench of this Tribunal in case of Special Bench of ITAT in case of
Instrumentation Corpn. Ltd. v. Asstt. DIT in ITA No. 1548 and 1549 (Kol.) of
2009, dated 15-7-2016, held that outstanding sum of invoices is akin to loan
advanced by assessee to foreign AE., hence it is an international transaction
as per explanation to section 92 B of the Act. We also perused decision relied
upon by Ld.AR. In our considered opinion, these are factually distinguishable
and thus, we reject argument advanced by Ld.AR.
23.8. Alternatively, it has been argued that in TNMM, working capital
adjustment subsumes sundry creditors. In such situation computing interest on
outstanding receivables and lones and advances to associated enterprise would
amount to double taxation. Hon'ble Delhi Tribunal in case of Orange Business
Services India Solutions Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA No. 6570/Del/2016 vide its
order dated 15.2.2018 has observed that:
> "There may be a delay in collection of monies for supplies made, even beyond
> the agreed limit, due to a variety of factors which would have to be
> investigated on a case to case basis. Importantly, the impact this would
> have on the working capital of the assessee would have to be studied. It
> went on to hold that, there has to be a proper inquiry by the TPO by
> analysing the statistics over a period of time to discern a pattern which
> would indicate that vis-à-vis the receivables for the supplies made to an
> AE, the arrangement reflected an international transaction intended to
> benefit the AE in some way. Similar matter once again came up for
> consideration before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Avenue Asia Advisors
> Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT (2017) 398 ITR 120 (Del). Following the earlier decision
> in Kusum Healthcare (supra), it was observed that there are several factors
> which need to be considered before holding that every receivable is an
> international transaction and  Page 29 of 31 IT(TP)A 3181/Bang/2018 A. Y :
> 2015 - 16 it requires an assessment on the working capital of the assessee.
> Applying the decision in Kusum Health Care (supra), the Hon'ble High Court
> directed the TPO to study the impact of the receivables appearing in the
> accounts of the assessee; looking into the various factors as to the reasons
> why the same are shown as receivables and also as to whether the said
> transactions can be characterized as international transactions."
23.9. In view of the above, we deem it appropriate to set aside this issue to
Ld.AO/TPO for deciding it in conformity with the above referred judgment.
Needless to say, the assessee will be allowed a reasonable opportunity of
being heard in accordance with law.
Accordingly these ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
In the result, appeal filed by assessee stands partly allowed. Order
pronounced in open court on 21st May 2020.
