25\. Turning to section 65 of Copyright Act, 1957, mere possession of one
cassette player, does not make out a case within sec 65 of the Copyright Act.
It is nobody's case that even a single blank cassette was recovered from the
possession of accused, on which the accused could have recorded the infringed
songs. Not even a single cassette is produced to show that the said cassette
was recorded on the machine of the accused. Accordingly there is no material
on which the prosecution could claim that the cassette player was

    (i)                  Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:-
1\. Sole accused Ghanshyam was sent up for trial in this case with the
prosecution that he infringed certain audio cassettes of certain producers and
he was found in possession of 525 infringed audio cassettes of different Hindi
film songs. Those cassettes were even not containing mandatory particulars as
required u/s.52A of Copyright Act, 1957 and from the possession of accused,
one recording machine was also recovered.
2\. Briefly stated the facts of this case are that on 09.10.1997, the
investigating team comprising of SI Kundan Sharma, ASI Satish, Ct. Kallu Singh
alongwith representative of complainant company Kanwar Singh were in
investigation of some other case FIR no.538/97 and during investigation of
that case, a secret information was received against the present
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright Act,
1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 2 of 11 k accused. Investigation of said FIR
no.538/97 was entrusted to ASI Satish Kumar and, SI Kuldeep Sharma alongwith
Kanwar Singh, the representative of Indian Music Industry (IMI in short), and
Ct. Kallu Singh reached shop no.1786, Jahangir Puri, Delhi, where accused
Ghanshyam was physically present and on searching the shop, total 525
infringed audio cassettes of various Hindi film songs were recovered. One
recording machine was also recovered. All those audio cassettes were not
containing mandatory particulars as required u/s.52A of Copyright Act, 1957.
3\. Accordingly, the accused was chargesheeted for the offence u/s.63 and 68A
of copyright Act 1957 and my Ld. Predecessor Court on 15.12.2000 framed
charges for the said offences against the accused. Charges u/s.65 of Copyright
Act, 1957 was not framed and perhaps inadvertently. Thereafter, this Court
vide order dated 26.6.2009 framed additional charge u/s.65 of Copyright Act,
1957 against the accused.
4\. Accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and prosecution in support of
its case examined total seven witnesses namely PW1 Ct. Kallu Singh, PW2 Ajay
Gupta, PW3 S. Sidhore, PW4 HC JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR
NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 3
of 11 k Nepal Singh, PW5 Ramesh Chauhan, PW6 Kanwar Singh and PW7 P.K. Jain.
5\. Out of those seven witnesses, PW2 Ajay Gupta was a formal witness, who
proved assignment document regarding assignment of copyright of movies
'Kalia', 'Bombay' and 'Jaanbaaz' as Ex. PW2/A and PW2/B.
6\. PW3 S. Sidhore as Secretary General of IMI proved his authority letter in
favour of Kanwar Singh as Ex. PW3/B and the resolution as Ex. PW3/A.
7\. PW4 HC Nepal Singh was the Duty Officer, who proved the FIR and
endorsement on ruqqa as Ex. PW1/D and Ex. PW4/A respectively.
8\. PW5 Ramesh Chauhan deposed that on 15.12.1988, he let out the shop in
question to accused. Very interestingly this witness was not put a question by
the prosecution nor the witness stated as to whether on the date of incident,
the accused was still continuing as a tenant of the shop from where alleged
infringed articles were recovered.
9\. PW7 P.K. Jain again proved the copyright documents of JUDGMENT/STATE VS.
GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 /
Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 4 of 11 k movies 'Betaab, Kalia, Dilwale Dulhaniya
Le Jayenge, Didaar, Daud and Jaanbaaz' as Ex.PW7/A1 to PW7/A6.
10\. Besides the above mentioned five formal witnesses, the prosecution
examined PW6 Kanwal Singh, who was the AR of complainant company and on whose
complaint, this case was registered. But this witness was only partly examined
in chief on 30.5.2003 and thereafter this witness was not examined in chief
further. Accordingly, the testimony of this witness was never complete and the
testimony of this witness cannot be read in evidence against the accused.
11\. Similarly, PW1 Kallu Singh, who was a member of raiding party was
examined in chief on 29.3.2001 and his cross examination opportunity was
closed on that day. But subsequently vide order dated 03.8.2005, my Ld.
Predecessor recalled this witness for his cross examination, but after
03.8.2005 till 30.6.2009 i.e. for about four years, witness PW1 was not
tendered for cross examination to the accused by the prosecution. Accordingly,
technically even the testimony of PW1 JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR
NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 5
of 11 k cannot be read against the accused. Therefore there is no evidence of
recovery from the accused.
12\. Besides this, what creates doubt about the prosecution's case is that it
is claimed by the prosecution that the present recovery was effected pursuant
to a secret information received in FIR no.538/97 on 09.10.1997. Perusal of
record reveals that Ex. PW6/A is a complaint dated 25.9.1997 i.e. around ten
days prior to the alleged date of recovery shown by the prosecution. Either
this complaint is ante dated or the date of recovery is not true. The two
theories put forth by the prosecution that the recovery was effected on
09.10.1997 pursuant to the secret information in another FIR no.538/97 and,
the second theory that the present case was on the complaint of Kanwar Singh,
which is ten days prior to the date of recovery i.e. on 25.9.1997, cannot be
go simultaneously. Both these stands of the prosecution are mutually
destructive.
13\. Even otherwise strictly speaking, the offence of infringement not made
out in the present case for the simple reason that the necessary ingredients
of offence of infringement are not fulfilled in the present case. It is
nobody's JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of
Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 6 of 11 k case that the audio
cassettes which were allegedly recovered were displayed for sale/hire in the
shop of the accused nor it is the case of prosecution that the accused offered
them to sale or hire to anybody.
14\. So far as offence u/s.68A of Copyright, 1957, is concerned, the same is
not made out against the accused for the reason that it is nobody's case that
cinematograph films and sound recordings were published within the meaning of
section 3 of Copyright Act.
15\. Section 52A of Copyright Act, 1957 provides that no person shall publish
a sound recording in respect of any work unless particulars as mentioned in
Sub-section (1) Clause (a) i.e. name and address of the person who made the
sound recording; name and address of the owner of the copyright in such work;
and year of its first publication are displayed on the sound recording or any
container thereof.
16\. The necessary ingredient of section 52A of Copyright Act is publication
of a sound recording and when these particulars are lacking, a person shall be
guilty for 68A of Copyright Act.
17\. What is publication is defined in Section (3) of the Copyright Act, 1957
and it says, that for the purposes of this Act, "publication" means making a
work available to the public by issue of copies or by communicating the work
to the JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright
Act, 1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 7 of 11 k public.
18\. The word communication of a work to the public is defined in Section 2
(ff) of the Act which says that "Communication to the public" means making any
work available for being seen or hear or otherwise enjoyed by the public
directly or by any means of display or diffusion other than by issuing copies
of such work regardless of whether any member of the public actually sees,
hears, or otherwise enjoys the work so made available.
19\. In the present case, admittedly none of the VCD/CD allegedly recovered
from the possession of accused were published within the meaning of section 2
(ff) and section 3 of the Act. Nor accused is alleged to have issued any
copies thereof to the public.
20\. Coming to the offence u/s.63 of Copyright Act, 1957, the offence of
infringement is defined in section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and it is
punishable u/s.63 Copyright Act, 1957.
21\. Infringement is defined in Section 51 of Copyright Act and it states that
Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed when any person, without a
licence granted by the owner of the copyright or, by Registrar of Copyrights
does anything, the exclusive rights to do which is by the Act conferred upon
the owner of the copyright of the said Act. It further provides that copyright
shall be deemed to be infringed if any person makes for sale or hire, or sells
or lets for hire, or by way of trade displays or offers for sale or hire any
infringing JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of
Copyright Act, 1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 8 of 11 k copies of the work.
It also provides that when any person distributes for the purposes of trade
any infringing copies, it shall be deemed infringement. Admittedly, Clause (a)
Section 51 and sub clause (iii) and (iv) of Clause (b) of section 51 are not
applicable in this case.
22\. What are the exclusive rights of a copyright holder, is defined in
Section 14 (1) (d), in the case of cinematograph film, and it says that
copyright in a cinematograph film means, exclusive rights to make copy of film
including the photographs of an image; to sell or give on hire or offer for
sale or hire any copy of the film; and to communicate the film to the public.
Similarly, section 14 (1) (e) provides the exclusive rights given to a
copyright holder, in case of sound recording. Therefore in order to prove
infringement it was incumbent on the prosecution to show that accused did
anything, the exclusive rights to which vested with the copyright holder, or,
the prosecution ought to have proved that accused sold or gave on hire or by
way of trade displayed or offered for sale or hire the infringing copies.
23\. Section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 makes punishable an offence of
infringement when a person knowingly infringes the copyright in a work. The
word 'knowing infringes' is of great significance, which requires active mens
rea present.
24\. In the case of 1994 CRI. L. J. 2469 in the case of A. K.
Mukherjee v. State Hon'ble DELHI HIGH COURT held as follows;
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. GHANSHYAM/ FIR NO.539/97/U.S.63,65,68A of Copyright Act,
1957 / Acquitted/02.9.2009 /Page 9 of 11 k " 8. A bare perusal of the
provision would go to show that emphasis is on the words "knowingly
infringes.... the Copyrights in a work." These words clearly postulate a
knowledge on the part of the accused that he was infringing the Copyright in a
work. Mere possibility of his having known it would not suffice. There has to
be clear and conclusive proof of the requisite knowledge. Even the existence
of reasonable means of knowing would not be enough. In short thus the use of
the work "knowingly" in the provision results in requiring "mens rea in the
full sense" [See Prof. J.C. Smity, "The Guilty Mind in the Criminal Law" 1960
Law Quarterly Review Vo. 76,p. 79]. This in short being the legal requirement
under Section 63 of the Copy-right Board, evidence shall have to be led to
bring home the required guilty knowledge."
25\. Turning to section 65 of Copyright Act, 1957, mere possession of one
cassette player, does not make out a case within sec 65 of the Copyright Act.
It is nobody's case that even a single blank cassette was recovered from the
possession of accused, on which the accused could have recorded the infringed
songs. Not even a single cassette is produced to show that the said cassette
was recorded on the machine of the accused. Accordingly there is no material
on which the prosecution could claim that the cassette player was

infringement by the accused which is a necessary ingredients of section 65 of
the copyright Act 1957.
26\. Accordingly, in such circumstances, accused is acquitted to the charges.
Surety bond and personal bond of the accused stands cancelled. His surety is
discharged. Endorsement, if any on the documents stand cancelled. File is
consigned to Record Room.
