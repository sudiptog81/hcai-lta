ORDER P.G. Chacko, Member (J)
1\. The appellants are engaged in the manufacture of manual typewriters and
parts / spares/accessories thereof, plastic components and parts for vacuum
cleaners, etc. They have manufacturing units at Chennai and Hosur. During the
period January 1997 to March 1998, the Chennai Unit stock-transferred
components (rear cover / cord winder assembly) for vacuum cleaners to the
Hosur Unit on payment of duty based on assessable value determined by cost
construction method and these goods were used captively in the manufacture of
vacuum cleaners by the latter Unit. The Department, by investigations, found
that the Hosur Unit had sold the said goods in the spares market at a higher
rate in wholesale. On the basis of this finding, the Department took the view
that, in terms of Section 4(1)(a) of the Central Excise Act, the price at
which the Hosur Unit sold the goods in wholesale in the spares market should
be adopted for the assessable value of the goods stock-transferred to them
from the Chennai Unit. Accordingly, a show-cause notice was issued on
17.11.1998 demanding differential duty of Rs. 10,75,017/- from the appellants
clarification had earlier been conveyed vide Board's Circular No. 20/89, dated
26.6.1989, wherein it had been clarified that the credit of specified duty can
be utilized for payment of any one of the specified duties. It is only for
convenience that the duties are credited in the register under separate heads.
The facility to transfer the balance from the Special Excise Duty Head to the
Basic Excise Duty Head in the account maintained under Rule 57A may be allowed
on an application submitted by a manufacturer. While granting this permission,
Chief Accounts Officer may be kept suitably informed.
3\. The field formations may be informed accordingly.
4\. A suitable trade notice may be issued for information of the Trade.
5\. The receipt of this circular may please be acknowledged.
It appear from the records that the above claim of the assessee was not
considered by the lower authorities. Therefore, after holding that duty of Rs.
6,49,079/- is recoverable from the assessee without time bar, we set aside the
demand of duty of Rs. 2,29,133/- and direct the original authority to take a
fresh decision on the availability of SED credit on inputs for payment of BED
17.11.1998 demanding differential duty of Rs. 10,75,017/- from the appellants
[Chennai Unit] under the proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 11A of the Act.
The extended period of limitation prescribed under the proviso was invoked by
alleging that the noticee had deliberately suppressed the value available
under Section 4(1)(a) ibid, the price at which the goods were sold in
wholesale by the Hosur Unit. The show-cause notice also proposed penalties on
the party under Section 11AC of the Act and Rule 173Q of the Central Excise
Rules, 1944. Before the original authority, the assessee defended their
assessable value determination by cost construction method under Rule 6(b)(ii)
of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 1975 read with Section 4(1)(b) of the
Act, by submitting that any wholesale price was not ascertainable for the
goods. The authority rejected this contention after a perusal of the relevant
invoices produced by the assessee. It also found that the assessee had not
declared to the Department the value available under Section 4(1)(a), which
was held to be suppression of vital information with intent to evade payment
of duty. Therefore, the adjudicating authority determined the assessable value
of the goods on the basis of the price at which the Hosur Unit sold the goods
in wholesale in the spares market, and confirmed the differential duty against
the assessee by invoking the extended period of limitation under Section 11A
of the Act. It also imposed penalties on the assessee under Section 11AC and
Rule 173Q. Appeal No. 1067/99 is against this decision of the Commissioner,
2\. Heard both sides and considered their submissions. It was submitted by
learned consultant that a major part of the stock of goods transferred from
the appellant-Unit to the Hosur Unit was consumed captively in the manufacture
of vacuum cleaners by the latter Unit and removed on payment of appropriate
duty and that the rest of the goods received from the appellant-Unit was used
by the Hosur Unit for repairing old vacuum cleaners returned for the purpose
by their customers under the provisions of Rule 173H of the Central Excise
Rules, 1944. The consultant also submitted that the return of vacuum cleaners
by the customers to the Hosur Unit for repairs was duly intimated to the
Department in Form D-
3\. It was also claimed that the D-3 intimation was evidenced by endorsements
made on the relevant invoices issued by the Hosur Unit, Learned consultant
submitted that the value addition made by the Hosur Unit to the components
used for repairs of vacuum cleaners returned by their customers was adopted by
the Department for enhancing the assessable value of the components stock-
transferred by the appellant Unit. Such value addition, according to learned
consultant, was not contemplated under Section 4(1)(a) of the Central Excise
Act. Learned SDR pointed out that this argument of the consultant was without
any factual support. We must accept this submission of learned SDR inasmuch as
we have not found any evidence of the facts pleaded by the consultant. Four
invoices of the Hosur Unit were cited by the Commissioner in his order. A copy
of one of these invoices [No 9635175 dated 31.1.1997] is available on record
and we have perused the same. There is nothing in this invoice to indicate
that it was issued in connection with removal of repaired vacuum cleaners
after following the procedure [including D-3 intimation] under Rule 173H. In
answer to a query from the Bench, the consultant conceded that the other
relevant invoices also did not indicate that the transactions thereunder were
in terms of Rule 173H. We find that even the appellants did not choose to
plead anything, in this appeal, with reference to Rule 173H. The consultant,
along with his written submissions produced copies of a few correspondences
between his clients and the Department, but these also did not indicate that
the Hosur Unit was following Rule 173H procedure. In the circumstances, we
must repudiate the above arguments of the consultant based on facts not even
pleaded by his clients. Contextually, we must also observe that, where a
consultant or advocate ventures to alter the facts of the case pleaded by his
clients, in a desperate bid to win the case, he is acting in excess of his
brief. Learned consultant relied on the Tribunal's decision in Commissioner v.
Ashok Leyland in support of the cost construction method adopted for valuation
of the goods transferred by the appellant-Unit to the Hosur Unit. In the cited
case, it was held that assessable value of goods stock-transferred by one of
the manufacturing unit of the company to another unit of the same company was
liable to be determined by the cost construction method under Rule 6(b)(ii)
read with Section 4(1)(b) of the Central Excise Act. But we find that the
correctness of the view taken by the Tribunal in the said case was doubted by
the Supreme Court in Ashok Leyland v. Commissioner . Further, we note that, in
the case considered by the apex Court there was an ascertainable price at
which the goods were sold in the market and therefore it was held that there
was no question of application of Section 4(1)(b) and Rule 6 of the valuation
of the goods. In the present case, it is evident from the records that some of
the goods stock-transferred from the appellant-Unit to the Hosur Unit were
sold by the latter in the spares market at a higher price and therefore that
price would be the normal price under Section 4(1)(a) of the Central Excise
Act for the purpose of determination of the assessable vale of the stock-
transferred goods. Learned Commissioner has done the valuation correctly. The
challenge against the demand of duty fails on merits.
3\. Learned consultant submitted that the plea of limitation raised by the
appellants against the demand of duty was not appropriately considered by the
Commissioner. It was submitted that, as whatever differential duty paid by the
appellant-Unit would be available as Modvat credit to the sister unit, it was
not correct to allege that the appellant-Unit had intention to evade payment
of duty. In the revenue-neutral situation, the extended period of limitation
was not invocable. In this connection, learned consultant relied on the
following decisions of the Tribunal:
• Kitply Industries Ltd. v. CCE • PTC Industries Ltd. v. CCE • Deckon
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. CCE • Indian Aluminium Company Ltd. v. CCE 2006 (198)
ELT 67 He also claimed support from the Supreme Court's judgments in the cases
of Commissioner v. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Commissioner v. Narayan
Polyplast 2005 (179) ELT 20 (SC). We find that learned Commissioner invoked
the extended period of limitation for demanding duty from the appellants by
holding that they had suppressed vital information with the intention to evade
payment of duty. Apparently, the aspect of revenue neutrality was not
considered while recording, against the party, intention to evade payment of
duty. We are of the view that learned Commissioner has to consider this aspect
also. As the quantification of duty would depend on fresh decision on the
limitation issue, the question whether any penalty is imposable on the party
under Section 11AC and, if so, to what extent will also have to be determined
afresh by the Commissioner. We find that the impugned order does not mention
any reason for imposing a separate penalty of Rs. 1.00 lakh on the party under
Rule 173Q. On our own, we have not found any good reason for such a penalty
either. In the result, we sustain the demand of duty on merits and direct the
Commissioner to decide afresh as to whether the extended period of limitation
is invocable for recovering the duty, after giving the assessee a reasonable
opportunity of being heard on the limitation issue. It will also be upto the
Commissioner to take a fresh decision on the question whether any penalty
under Section 11AC is liable to be imposed on the assessee, depending on his
decision on invocability of the proviso to Section 11A(1) of the Act. However,
it will not be open to learned Commissioner to impose any penalty on the
assessee under Rule 173Q. Appeal No. E/ 1067/99 is disposed of in these terms.
4\. The remaining appeal is against a demand of duty of Rs. 8,78,212/- for the
period April 1998 to March 1999. It appears from the records that the original
authority had demanded differential duty of over Rs. 48.00 lakhs from the
assessee by finalizing provisional assessments for the period from the March
1994 to February 2000 and that the first appellate authority set aside a major
part of this demand and sustained demand of duty to the extent of Rs.
8,78,212/- only. It further appears that, out of this amount of duty demanded
by the appellate authority, duty of Rs. 6,49,079/- was demanded in the same
manner as duly was demanded by the Commissioner (Adjudication) for the prior
period (January 1997 to March 1998). Therefore, we have to sustain this demand
of duty for the reasons noted by us in respect of Appeal No. 1067/99. As it is
not in dispute that the assessments were provisional till finalization by the
original authority, there is no question of the demand of duty being barred by
limitation. A demand of duty to the tune of Rs. 2,29,133/-sustained by the
lower appellate authority for the period of dispute is by way of refusal of
permission to the assessee to avail Modvat credit of Special Excise Duty (SED)
for payment of Basic Excise Duty (BED). In the present appeal, the only
challenge pressed by learned consultant is against this refusal of permission
to the assessee for utilization of SED credit for payment of BED. Learned
consultant relied on Sub-rule (8) of Rule 57F (as amended by Notification No.
8/93-CE (NT) dated 2.11.93) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, which reads as
under:
(8) The credit of Special duty of excise paid on inputs on or prior to 28th
day of February, 1993 may be utilized towards payment of duty on final
products cleared subsequent to 28th day of February, 1993 but prior to 31st
day of March, 1994 for the manufacture of which such inputs were permitted to
be brought into the factory.
Learned SDR submitted that the above provision did not permit the assessee to
utilize the credit of SED paid on inputs for payment of BED on final product
removed after 31.3.1994. This objection was sought to be got over by learned
consultant by relying on Board's Circular No. 4/93 CX.8 dated 23.4.1993, which
reads as under:
Government of India Central Board of Excise & Customs New Delhi Subject:
Central Excise - Transfer of credit balance lying in RG 23A under one minor

2\. It is observed that Rule 57A and Notification 17/86-CE issued thereunder
provide for utilization of credit of any of the duties of excise paid on
inputs for the payment of any duty of excise leviable on final product. This
clarification had earlier been conveyed vide Board's Circular No. 20/89, dated

[Chennai Unit] under the proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 11A of the Act.
The extended period of limitation prescribed under the proviso was invoked by
alleging that the noticee had deliberately suppressed the value available
under Section 4(1)(a) ibid, the price at which the goods were sold in
wholesale by the Hosur Unit. The show-cause notice also proposed penalties on
the party under Section 11AC of the Act and Rule 173Q of the Central Excise
Rules, 1944. Before the original authority, the assessee defended their
assessable value determination by cost construction method under Rule 6(b)(ii)
of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 1975 read with Section 4(1)(b) of the
Act, by submitting that any wholesale price was not ascertainable for the
goods. The authority rejected this contention after a perusal of the relevant
invoices produced by the assessee. It also found that the assessee had not
declared to the Department the value available under Section 4(1)(a), which
was held to be suppression of vital information with intent to evade payment
