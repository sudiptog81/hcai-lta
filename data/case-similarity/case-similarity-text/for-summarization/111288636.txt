objections for the reason that revenue in its cross objection has raised an
objection that the appeal of the assessee is not maintainable on the ground
that the assessment has been framed by the Assessing Officer u/s 144 of the
Income Tax Act. Therefore, assessee in order to avoid any technical issues in
its appeal has raised following additional grounds in its cross objection:-

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Additional/ Modified objections:-
Cross objection No. 6:-
That the Learned Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (Ld. AO), Circle 13(1),
New Delhi has erred both on facts and, in law in determining income of the
Appellant at Rs. 8,38,33,37,197 /- as against the returned loss of Rs.
64,83,91,422 in an order of assessment dated February 21, 2014 framed u/s 144
read with section 144C (13) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) and the
assessment framed is apparently without jurisdiction as well as barred by
limitation.
Cross objection No. 7:-
That the various findings recorded by the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP in the impugned
orders are highly perverse and have been recorded with preconceived notions
and without considering the submissions/evidences/material produced on record
and hence, such findings are vitiated and deserve to be rejected and the
additions so made in the impugned assessment order deserve to be deleted.
Cross objection No. 8:-
That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the instant
case in making an addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- (as sum equivalent to $150
Million) by invoking section 69A of the Act purely on surmises, conjectures
and suspicion, failing to appreciate that under section 69A of the Act, the
burden lay upon him to establish that, Appellant had made an investment of
which it is an owner and has not been recorded by it in its books of accounts.
1.1 That the Ld. AO/Ld.DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the
instant case in making an addition of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 642,54,22,000/-
by invoking section 69A of the Act even without appreciating that the
aforesaid sum was not an unexplained sum of money as the said sum was a
capital contribution made by M/s Universal Studios International BV against
the subscription of share  8 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, capital and
had also duly been recorded in the books of accounts of the investee company
i.e. NDTV Networks International Holdings BV(NNIH).
1.2 That the findings of the Ld. AO that the Appellant had not complied with
the provisions of section 212 of Companies Act, as the prescribed documents
were not attached with the audited accounts is highly arbitrary and not in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and has been recorded by brushing
aside the order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which has exempted the
assessee to attach the details of the subsidiary companies with its balance
sheet.
1.3 That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP erred in applying the provisions of section 69A of
the Act by failing to appreciate that the transaction in question does not
pertain to the Appellant and the Appellant is not a party to the said
transaction.
Cross objection No. 9:-
That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the instant
case in making an addition of Rs. 2,54,75,00,000/- (as sum equivalent to $50
Million) by invoking provisions of section 68 of the Act purely on extraneous
or irrelevant consideration and in failing to appreciate that there was no
credits in the books of Appellant and as such section 68 of the Act had no
application.
9.1 That the Ld. AO/Ld DRP grossly erred in not appreciating that the borrower
of the loan namely NDTV Networks Plc, UK (NNPLC) is a separate assessee which
is liable to be taxed separately for its income and no addition is warranted
of the aforesaid loan transaction in the total income of the Appellant under
section 68 of the Act. Cross objection No. 10:-
Without prejudice to Cross objection No. 9 above, that the Ld. DRP exceeded
its jurisdiction while directing the Ld. AO to enhance the variations as a
result of further enquiry in respect of the loan transaction between the NDTV

M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Networks Plc. UK and NDTV Networks BV,
as such a direction is outside the purview of powers of the Ld. DRP in view of
section 144C(8) of the Act.
10.1 That the Ld. DRP failed to appreciate that being an appellate authority
in view of the amendment in Finance Act 2012, the Ld. DRP ought not to have
issued any directions for taxing any new source of income which is not
emanating from the impugned draft assessment order. Cross objection No. 11:-
That the Ld. DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the case in
directing the Ld. AO to record his reasons before invoking Rule 8D of the
Income Tax Rules (Rules), 1962, without appreciating that the provisions of
section 14A of the Act are not applicable to the facts of the instant case.
11.1 That the Ld. AO erred in making an addition of Rs. 78,40,990 by invoking
the provisions of section 14A of the Act read with Rule 8D of the Rules by
rejecting the claim of the Appellant that it has not incurred any expenditure
in respect of the investments from which the earnings are exempt under the
Act.
Cross objection No. 12:-
That on facts of the case and in law, the Ld. TPO/AO has erred in not
discharging their statutory onus to establish that any of the conditions
specified in clause (a) to (d) of Section 92C (3) of the Act have been
satisfied before disregarding the arm's length price determined by the
Appellant and proceeding to determine the arm's length price themselves.
Cross objection No. 13:-
That Ld. AO erred in enhancing the ALP by Rs. 74,63,229/- in respect of the
international transaction pertaining to provision of business support services
('BSS') to its associated enterprises (AE) by arbitrarily rejecting the  10
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, comparables adopted by the Appellant and by
selecting the comparables which were not comparables on the basis of FAR
(functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed).
13.1 That the Ld. TPO erred in inadvertently considering the amount of price
received for the impugned international transaction (BSS) as Rs 7,46,87,177
instead of Rs 7,52,77,881 while computing the adjustment thereby, resulting in
incorrect computation of the adjustment.
Cross objection No. 14:-
That the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO has grossly erred in making an addition of Rs.
4,35,02,400/- in respect of the alleged international transaction of provision
of Corporate Guarantee on the ground that the Appellant should have been
compensated for providing such alleged guarantee.
14.1 That the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO failed to appreciate that the Appellant did not
provide any corporate guarantee during the year but merely gave an undertaking
to provide guarantee for and on behalf of its AE and had not actually provided
any guarantee.
14.2 That the Ld. AO/Ld. TPO erred in computing the arm's length guarantee
commission rate erroneously based on flawed methodology and adjustments
(without prejudice to the Appellant's contention that it had not provided any
guarantee).
Cross objection No. 15:-
That on the facts of the case and in law, the Ld. AO has erred in levying
interest under 234B/D of the Act while completely disregarding the provisions
of the Act and the judicial precedence in this regard.

14\. Now we first come to the appeal of the assesse in ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
and test it whether it is maintainable or not.
15\. On the issue of maintainability of appeal, the ld AR commenced the
arguments that appeal of the assessee is maintainable. The ld authorized
representative of the assessee vehemently submitted that cross objection filed
by the Revenue in CO No. 303/Del/2014 in appeal of the assessee in ITA No.
1212/Del/2014, the Revenue has raised the issue that when the order of the ld
Assessing Officer is passed u/s 144 of the Income Tax Act, therefore, on
conjoint reading of section 253(1)(d) restricts the right of the assessee of
appeal before the tribunal. He further stated that according to the Revenue if
the assessment order is passed u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act pursuant to
the direction issued by the DRP then only the assessee has right to file an
appeal before the Tribunal. He vehemently opposed the above objection of the
revenue. He further stated that above stated Cross objection (CO) of the
assessee has been dismissed by the coordinate bench vide order dated
23.03.2017 refusing to condone the delay as it was delayed by 169 days. He
further submitted a copy of the letter dated 31.03.2013 issued by Deputy
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 13(1), New Delhi by the then assessing
officer to the assessee forwarding draft assessment order wherein, it has been
stated that draft assessment order is passed u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act
read with Section 144C of the Income Tax Act for AY 2009-10 in the case of the
assessee. Therefore, he submitted that draft assessment order is passed u/s
143(3) by the ld Assessing Officer and not u/s 144  12 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, as claimed by the Revenue therefore final assessment order canot
be passed u/s 144 of the act. He further referred to the draft assessment
order passed by ld Assessing Officer which is placed at page no. 355 of the
appeal set wherein, in heading at Sl No. 11 it is mentioned that impugned
draft order dated 31.03.2013 is passed u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of
the Act. He further referred to the heading of the order which also says that
draft assessment order is passed u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act.
He referred to the final assessment order placed at page No. 63 of the appeal
set to say that ld Assessing Officer has without any reason mentioned section
144 in the heading of the order. He therefore submitted that for all intent
and purposes the assessment order passed by the ld Assessing Officer is u/s
143(3) of the act and not u/s 144 of the act as claimed by the revenue.
16\. With respect to the claim of the Revenue that order has been passed by
the ld Assessing Officer u/s 144 of the Income Tax Act he referred to page No.
400 of the appeal set and referred page No. 46 of 51 of the draft assessment
order. His contention was that as the material information according to the ld
Assessing Officer pertaining to the subsidiaries companies of the assessee was
not furnished pursuant to summons issued in December 2010 and notice issued in
February 2013, the ld Assessing Officer has held that accounts of the assessee
are not maintained and prepared in accordance with the accounting standards
issued by the Central Govt. and are therefore, incomplete and incorrect.
Therefore, the Assessing Officer invoked provision of section 145(3) of the
Act read with section 209, 210, 211 and 212 of the Companies Act, 1956. He
further referred to page No. 47 of 51 of the draft assessment order where the
ld Assessing Officer invoked the provisions of section 145(3) of the act. He
further referred to page No. 48 of 51 to show that as according to the
Assessing Officer there was a breach of condition prescribed u/s 145(3) of the
Act and Assessing Officer was not satisfied about the correctness and
completeness of the account and as according to him the accounting standard
notified have not been followed by the assessee, ld Assessing Officer applied
provisions of section 145(3) and assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act. He
vehemently submitted that the ld Assessing Officer does not have any right to
invoke the provisions of section 145(3) at the first instance and further
merely because provisions of section 145(3)  13 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, are violated the ld Assessing Officer does not have right to
invoke the provisions of section 144 of the Act. He therefore first referred
to provision of section 145(3) of the Act to submit that the accounts of the
assessee are correct and complete. He further referred to the annual accounts
of the company to show that assessee has been granted an exemption by the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs for not including the annual account of the
subsidiaries of the company. He referred to page No.1746 to 1883 of the paper
book Vol No. V which is the Directors Report of the company dated 30/4/2009 to
show that assessee was exempted as it has been granted approval u/s 212(8) of
the Companies Act, 1956 for the financial year ended on 31.03.2009 waving the
publication of publishing of individual balance sheet etc of the subsidiaries
and other documents otherwise required to be attached with the account of the
company. He therefore, submitted that assessee has obtained permission
required by the law for not enclosing the relevant details of subsidiary
company and therefore, Assessing Officer cannot say that assessee has not
submitted the accounts of the subsidiaries and therefore the accounts of the
assessee are not incomplete. In the end, he submitted a note stating that
accounts of the assessee are complete and proper. Contents of his note are as
under:- "
> 1\. The captioned appeals and cross objection pertaining to AY 2009-10 are
> fixed for hearing on 03.07.2017 having been adjourned from 01.05.2017.
> 2\. That on 20.03.2017, the Hon'ble Tribunal was pleased to hear the cross

> Ltd, Vs.ACIT, said cross objection when it had held that the cross objection
> filed is not maintainable.
3\. It is further submitted that the ‗subject matter' of appeal in assessee's
appeal (ITA No. 1212/Del/2014) is as per grounds of appeal and for the sake of
brevity are not being extracted here. The assessee had also filed cross
objection No. 233/Del/2014 in an appeal filed by the revenue i.e. ITA No.
2658/Del/2014. The said cross objection was filed on 08.09.2014. The assessee
also filed additional grounds of cross objection (apart from the grounds of
cross objection in CO No. 233/2014) in the cross objection filed by the
asessee. The said ‗additional grounds' in CO No. 233/2014 were filed on
03.02.2016 and also filed modified ground No. 5 of cross objection on
24.05.2016.
4\. It is submitted that the perusal of the ground of appeal filed by the
assessee or filed by the revenue as also the grounds of cross objection filed
by the assessee does not pertain to any ground about the maintainability of
the appeal and on the ground that an assessment had been made u/s 144 of the
Act which is disputed by the assessee. Infact, such a ground of cross
objection was subject matter in the CO No. 313/Del/2014 filed by the revenue
and has been disposed off. Infact, ‗subject matter' of the appeal before the
Hon'ble Tribunal are contained in the grounds of appeal raised by the assessee
and in the cross objection filed by the assessee including additional grounds
and modified ground No. 5 of cross objection on 24.05.2016, as well as in the
grounds of appeal filed by the revenue.
5\. Sir(s), one of the contention which the revenue is raising, is not the
subject matter of appeals or of the cross objection, is about the
maintainability of the appeal filed by the assessee i.e. ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
and is on the ground that since the assessment has been framed u/s 144 of the
Income Tax Act, and no appeal has been provided u/s 253(1)(d) of the Act
(since the assessment has been  15 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, framed
u/s 144 of the Act and not u/s 143(3) of the Act), the said appeal is not
maintainable.
6\. However, in rebuttal it is submitted that the revenue is not invoking Rule
27 of the ITAT Rules nor any application has been filed by the revenue in that
regard. Further in the submissions made apart from justifying the contention
that a. Assessment has been made u/s 144 of the Act;
b. No appeal would lie before the Hon'ble Tribunal;
It has not been stated that in the absence of such a ground being subject
matter of appeal, how an adjudication can be sought from the Hon'ble Tribunal.
The submission of the assessee is that the Hon'ble Tribunal has to decide an
appeal and record its finding only on the subject matter of appeal. It is
undeniable fact that the Hon'ble Tribunal has entertained the appeal when it
has granted the stay u/s 254(2A) of the Act and revenue has not filed any writ
challenging the order on the ground that the appeal is not maintainable before
the Hon'ble Tribunal. In brief the submission is that:
a. That no appeal would lie before the Hon'ble Tribunal is a non issue;
b. It is a fait accompli i.e. appeal filed by the appeal is not maintainable;
c. The assessment has not been framed u/s 144 o the Act as has been contended
by the revenue instead an assessment framed u/s 143(3) of the Act.
Without prejudice to the aforesaid, and to support that the contention of the
revenue that assessment was framed u/s 144 of the Act is misconceived, it is
submitted as under:
16
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
> (a) The draft order of assessment dated 31.03.2013 was admittedly made u/s
> 143(3) read with section 144C of the IT Act as is specifically stated by the
> learned AO in the order and thus it is an admitted fact that the draft order
> of assessment was not made u/s 144 of the Act. In fact, there is no concept
> of framing the draft order of assessment u/s 144 of the Act.
(b) There is no finding or direction given by the learned DRP that the final
order of assessment be made u/s 144 of the Act. In respect thereof it is
submitted that the learned AO without jurisdiction, post receipt of the
directions of the learned DRP changed the title of the assessment order
labeling it to be passed u/s 144 r.w.s. 144C of the Act though there was no
such direction issued by the learned DRP.
(c) Further, no direction had been given by the learned CIT in the appeal
filed by the revenue, (who has directed the appeal to be filed before the
Hon'ble Tribunal against the directions of the learned DRP by the revenue) to
raise such ground, and thus it is submitted, it being not a subject matter of
appeal, cannot be held to be the subject matter of appeal before the Hon'ble
Bench and hence cannot be agitated or any finding can be given by the Hon'ble
Tribunal.
(d) The contention thus is that the submission of the revenue that no appeal
is maintainable since assessment has been made u/s 144 of the Act, is not the
subject matter of appeal since in none of the grounds of appeal raised by the
assessee or revenue such a ground of appeal emerge.
7\. It may be stated here that revenue in the written submission has however
contended that the appeal is not maintainable overlooking that such a ground
is not the subject matter of appeal. That the revenue has placed reliance on
Rule 27 of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Rules in support of its
contention that such a contention is  17 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
permissible to be raised. The assessee vehemently opposes such a contention on
the ground that it is impermissible to invoke Rule 27 Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal Rules, 1963. In support the assessee seeks to rely upon the judgment
of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case of Divine Infracon Pvt. Ltd.
(ITA No. 771/2015) decided by the Hon'ble High Court on 13.08.2015, wherein an
identical contention was raised before the High Court by the revenue and it
was held by the High Court that the Tribunal had erred to have permitted Rule
27 to be invoked as it was not the subject matter of appeal. The discussion
would be found in paragraphs 5 to 13 of the said judgment wherein it was held
that the Hon'ble Tribunal could only deal with the subject matter of appeal
and it would not be open to a respondent to travel outside the scope of the
subject matter of the appeal under the guise of invoking Rule 27. Aforesaid
submissions have been raised which are without prejudice to its submission
that the revenue's contention that assessment has been framed u/s 144 is
completely misconceived both factually and legally.
8\. It is submitted that neither the draft order of assessment reflect that
the draft order was framed u/s 144 of the Act nor it is submitted with respect
that there is a direction by the learned DRP to frame assessment u/s 144 of
the Income Tax Act. It is added here that had, the draft assessment been made
u/s 144 of the Act then it is obvious, as provided u/s 246A of the Act, the
only remedy available was to file an appeal before the learned CIT(A) and not
to have filed objection before the learned DRP u/s 144C(5) of the Act. In fact
it appears the learned AO on the strength of the observation made by him in
the draft order dated 31.03.2013 (see pages 48 - 49) is contending that the
draft of the order of assessment was made u/s 144 of the Act. The finding
recorded are as below:
18
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, ―In view of the same as stated
> hereinabove, the undersigned holds and declares that the provisions of
> section 145(3) of the IT Act, 1961 is applicable to the case of the assessee
> for the assessment year 2009-10 in respect of previous year 2008-09 and
> undersigned thereby and therefore assumes jurisdiction under section 144 of
> the IT Act, 1961 to determine the true and correct income of the assessee
> company.‖
9\. It is submitted that such a contention is completely misconceived. The
mere fact the learned AO had in the draft of the order declared that he is
invoking section 145(3) does not postulate that assessment was made u/s 144 of
the Act.
10\. It is submitted that the assessment u/s 144 of the Act could be made only
in the circumstances as provided u/s 144 of the Act. The provision of section
144 of the Act are extracted here below:
> Best judgment assessment.
> 144\. (1) If any person--
> (a) fails to make the return required under sub- section (1) of section 139
> and has not made a return or a revised return under sub-section (4) or sub-
> section (5) of that section, or
> (b) fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under sub-section
> (1) of section 142 or fails to comply with a direction issued under sub-
section (2A) of that section, or  19 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(c) having made a return, fails to comply with all the terms of a notice
issued under sub-section (2) of section 143, the Assessing Officer, after
taking into account all relevant material which the Assessing Officer has
gathered, shall, after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard, make
the assessment of the total income or loss to the best of his judgment and
determine the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such assessment :
Provided that such opportunity shall be given by the Assessing Officer by
serving a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a date and time
to be specified in the notice, why the assessment should not be completed to
the best of his judgment :
Provided further that it shall not be necessary to give such opportunity in a
case where a notice under sub-section (1) of section 142 has been issued prior
to the making of an assessment under this section.
(2) The provisions of this section as they stood immediately before their
amendment by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987 (4 of 1988), shall
apply to and in relation to any assessment for the assessment year commencing
on the 1st day of April, 1988, or any earlier assessment year and references
in this section to the other provisions of this Act shall be construed as
references to those provisions as for the time being in force and applicable
to the relevant assessment year.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
11\. In the instant case it is submitted that the assessee had neither failed
to make return nor it had failed to comply with all the terms of the notice
issued u/s 142(1) of the Act or having made the return, failed to comply with
all the terms of section 143(2) of the Act. There are no other circumstances
which permit the learned AO to frame assessment u/s 144 of the Act. In the
instant case, none of the aforesaid circumstances exists or can be shown to
have existed. Thus it is submitted the mere fact that the learned AO intended
to compute income u/s 145(3) does not made an order of assessment to be an
order u/s 144 of the Act. Section 145(3) reads as under:
> ―Where the Assessing Officer is not satisfied about the correctness or
> completeness of the accounts of the assessee, or where the method of
> accounting provided in sub-
> section (1),[or accounting standards as notified under sub-section (2), have
> not been regularly followed by the assessee], the Assessing Officer may make
> an assessment in the manner provided in section 144.‖
12\. It is further submitted that when the direction of the learned DRP dated
31.12.2013, is perused it would be seen that nowhere the learned DRP states
that the draft assessment order is an order to be read to be an order of
assessment made u/s 144 of the Act.
13\. The appellant further submits that by merely invoking the provision of
section 145(3) of the Act, an order cannot be said to be made u/s 144 of the
Act. All what section 145(3) of the Act provides is that, the AO may make an
assessment in the manner provided u/s 144 and not that assessment is made u/s
144, since the conditions making assessment  21 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, u/s 144 are entirely different. There is a distinction between
the manner of making assessment and completing assessment as provided u/s 144
of the Act, they are not identical in terms.
14\. It is submitted that in the instant case assessment has not been framed
u/s 144 of the Income Tax Act. Nor can be stated that merely because the
learned AO in the draft order of assessment has stated that he is computing
the income in the manner provided u/s 145(3) of the Act assessment has been
completed u/s 144 of the Act. There is a substantial difference in framing an
assessment u/s 144 of the Act and of computing income by invoking the
provisions of section 145(3) of the Act. In support the appellant seeks to
rely upon the judgment of the Nagpur High Court in the case of CIT vs.
BadridasRamrai Shop reported in 7 ITR 613, wherein their Lordships while
considering the provisions of section 13 (which is parimateria with section
145) had held that ―the only difference between the proviso to section 13 and
the provisions of section 23(4) (corresponding to section 144) is that the

Officer may determine‖. The proviso to section 13 gives the Income-tax Officer

(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 14.1 In view of the
aforesaid it is most respectfully submitted that the assertion of the counsel
for the revenue in the instant proceedings that the assessment was framed u/s
144 and as such no appeal lies is completely misconceived. It is reiterated
that assessment has not been framed as a conditions for framing assessment u/s
144 were not existent. Even otherwise even the draft order shows that draft of
the order of assessment was framed u/s 143(3) and not u/s 144 of the Income
Tax Act. Further it is submitted that the learned DRP had not issued any
direction to frame assessment u/s 144 of the Act.
14.2 In CIT vs. Standard Triumph Motor Co. Ltd., 119 ITR 573 (Mad.) (affirmed
by Supreme Court in 201 ITR 391), and CIT vs. Kerala Financial Corporation
Ltd., 155 ITR 246 (Ker.), CIT vs. MariappaGounder (P), 147 ITR 676 (Mad.)
affirmed by the Supreme Court in 232 ITR 2, it has been held that section
145(3) of the Act is a machinery section which does not qualify as charging
section of the Income Tax Act. It is thus submitted that contention of the
revenue is entirely misconceived. Since section 145(3) is not a charging
section but is a machinery provision, whereas section 144 is a charging
provision 14.3 In brief it is submitted that merely because the AO in his
draft order of assessment had stated that the provisions of section 145(3) of
the Act is applicable and therefore he assumes jurisdiction us/ 144 of the Act
to determine the true and correct income of the assessee company does not be
read to a concluded assessment was made u/s 144 of the Ac. Had the same been
an assessment made u/s 144 then it is obvious there could have been no
reference us/ 144C, could have been made to the DRP; whereas the AO while
forwarding the draft order has required the assessee either accept the order
or to file objection before the DRP. In such a situation now to turn around to
24 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, show that assessment was made u/s 144
of the Act is misleading contention.
15\. Lastly it is submitted that Gujarat High Court has held in CIT vs.
Purshottamdas T. Patel reported in 209 ITR 52, that the assessment is one
integrated process is completed only when total income is determine and
determination of tax is also made. In the instant case draft order of
assessment was framed on 31.03.2013; whereas notice of demand was issued only
on 21.02.2014; whereas the assessment has to be framed by 31.12.2013. Thus the
assessment made is apparently barred by limitation and is nonest in the eyes
of law. In fact it is submitted had this been the contention of the revenue
then obviously the assessment had been framed before 31.12.2013 and would have
been barred by limitation on that date.
16\. The appellant submits that the subject matter of the cross objection
which is now being raised by the revenue by invoking rule 27 of the ITAT
Rules, despite the fact that such a cross objection has been dismissed may be
on the ground that the delay in filing of the cross objection have not been
condoned, yet there is merger of such a ground raised in the cross objection.
In any case, it is submitted that rule 27 of the ITAT Rules is inapplicable in
the instant case as such a Rule can be invoked by the respondent only when no
appeal has been preferred by the respondent. For the sake of convenience Rule
27 is extracted hereinbelow:
> Respondent may support order on grounds decided against him.
> 27\. The respondent, though he may not have appealed, may support the order
> appealed against on any of the grounds decided against him.
It would be seen that aforesaid rule come to aid of a respondent who has not
preferred an appeal before the Tribunal and if any ground has been decided
against the respondent by the CIT(A), then in the appeal  25 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, of the appellant, he may support the order of
CIT(A) on any of the grounds decided against him. However such a rule has no
application where respondent has preferred an appeal. It is submitted that
since the respondent has preferred an appeal, as such, aforesaid rule cannot
be invoked.
17\. In para 5 of the written submissions of the revenue filed on 20.03.2017,
it has been contended by the revenue that the appellant has admitted the fact
that the assessment was completed under section 144 of the Act (since the same
has been stated in the relevant particulars of the Form 36B filed by the
appellant) is completely misconceived and erroneous. It is submitted that such
an averment is not only misconceived but is wholly fallacious. It is submitted
that since the appellant was required to state in Form 36B in column the
section quoted in the final assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer
(―AO‖) in pursuance to the directions of the Hon'ble DRP, the assessee had no
option but to state the section stated in the order. It is thus submitted that
there is no admission as has been alleged. However, it is denied that the
appellant had accepted the assessment being framed u/s 144 rws 144C(13) of the
Act and the same is evident from Ground number 1 specifically taken by the
appellant in appeal no. 1212/Del/2014 that the assessment so completed is
without jurisdiction and barred by limitation.
18\. Section 253(1)(d) of the Act, though states that the appeal can be filed
with the Hon'ble ITAT against the order passed by the AO under section 143(3)
in pursuance to the direction of DRP. Apparently, in the present case, the
draft assessment order was passed u/s 143(3) rws 144C of the Act and the same
is an admitted fact by the AO in para 2.1 and para 3 of the final assessment
order dated 21.02.2014. However, the AO without jurisdiction, post receipt of
the directions of DRP changed the title of the assessment order to 144 rws
144C though  26 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, there was no such
direction issued by the DRP. This itself shows that the action of the AO is
completely arbitrary and without jurisdiction. In support of the above,
reliance is placed on the judgement of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case
of WocoMotherson Advanced Rubber Technologies Limited80 taxmann.com 63. It is
submitted that in the said judgment, the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court has held
that the learned AO is duty bound to give effect to the directions of the
learned DRP. In the instant case, the learned AO acted without jurisdiction
when he went to change the filed of the order which is evidently an
afterthought. It is submitted that para 2.1 and in para 3, the AOhas held that
the draft order of assessment was made u/s 143(3) of the Act read with section
144C(1) of the Act and not that it was made u/s 144 of the Act.
19\. Without prejudice to the above, It is an admitted position that if an AO
intends to complete the assessment u/s 144 of the Act, he ought to issue the
final assessment order including the income determined and tax computed and
there is no need to propose an income and seek the directions of the DRP. The
provisions of section 144C of the Act have no application whatsoever which is
clearly spelt out by the provisions of section 246A of the Act. Thus, appeal
against the order u/s 144 would lie before the CIT(A).
20\. Assuming that the assessment was completed u/s 144 of the act, then in
that case the AO ought to have completed the assessment i.e. determined total
income and raised demand notice by 31.03.2013 itself rather than proposing to
make adjustment to the returned income as emphasized in the procedure laid
down u/s 144C of the Act. To support the the same, the appellant places
reliance on the judgement of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
Purushottamdas T. Patel 209 ITR 52.
27
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
21\. In para 7 of the said submission made by the revenue, the AO has admitted
that under the provisions of section 246A of the Act, appeal against both the
classes of assessment i.e. u/s 143(3) and 144 of the Act can be filed before
the CIT(A). However, he failed to appreciate that for filing an appeal, the AO
ought to have determined the total assessed income and demand and issued
notice u/s 156 of the Act. Otherwise, whatsoever appeal cannot be filed with
the CIT(A). It is undisputed that no demand notice was issued along with the
draft assessment order dated 31.03.2013 and which was issued on 21.02.2014.
Thus, the assessment in the present case is barred by limitation as held in
the case of Purushottam T Patel (Supra).
22\. Since in the present case, draft assessment order was issued u/s 143(3)
rws 144C of the Act, the AO himself directed the appellant to files its
objections before the DRP meaning thereby that the assessment was completed
u/s 143(3) and not 144 of the Act.
23\. From para 8 onwards of the said submission, the AO has contested that the
right to appeal is not an inherent right unless it is provided for in the
statute. The above proposition has no relevance on the facts stated above
since if an assessee does not have a right to appeal it could only be trite of
law in the peculiar facts of the present case wherein an assessment which is
draft assessment u/s 143(3) and subsequently changed to u/s 144 in a complete
biased, arbitrary and illegalmanner which renders the entire proceedings void-
ab -initio and illegal.
24\. It is also submitted that in the present case, provisions of section
145(3) were invoked which provides that the AO has liberty to complete the
assessment u/s 143(3) of the Act in the manner provided u/s 144 of the Act. In
other words, the assessment so made will still continue to be u/s 143(3) of
the Act only. It does not mean that the  28 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessment is completed u/s 144 of the Act. In support of the
same, reliance is placed on the judgment of Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the
case of Ponkunnam Traders (102 ITR 366).‖
17\. He therefore, submitted that merely invoking provisions of section 145(3)
does not allow the Assessing Officer to pass an order u/s 144 of the Income
Tax Act, 1961. He further referred to provisions of section 144 of the Act to
state that in clause (a) to
(c) of Section 144(1) covers four situations and failure of any of the
conditions is not established by the Revenue and therefore, the provisions of
section 144 cannot be invoked. He further, submitted that provisions of
section 145(3) or its failure does not give any right to the ld Assessing
Officer to pass an order u/s 144 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. He therefore
pressed upon that order actually passed by the ld Assessing Officer is order
u/s 143(3) of the Act.
18\. He further raised the arguments that assessment order is barred by
limitation he referred that as no notice of demand was issued along with the
draft assessment order it is not an order passed under the Income Tax Act,
1961 and therefore, the order is barred by limitation.
19\. Against this the ld DR submitted that though the cross objection of the
Revenue has been dismissed by the coordinate bench on technical grounds but
still the Revenue has right to submit that the appeal of the assessee is not
maintainable. He relied upon the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Post
Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Vs. A.P. Vasan and others
in (2003) 5 Supreme Court Cases 321. He referred to para No. 26 of the order
to state that despite the fact that revenue has not filed a counter appeal
they could nevertheless challenge the appeal of the assessee. On dismissal of
cross objection of the Revenue he submitted that there are several errors in
the order dated 23.03.2017 of the coordinate bench. He specifically referred
to submission dated 01.05.2017 of the AO. He has submitted that even if the CO
of the Revenue has been dismissed still Revenue can challenge the
maintainability of the appeal of the assessee.
20\. To show that impugned order in fact has been passed u/s 144 of the Act,
he refereed that in Form No. 36B filed by the assessee in Column No. 2 it has
been stated by the assessee itself that order is passed u/s 144 read with
Section  29 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 144C(13) of the Act. He
further referred to ground No. 1 of the appeal of the Revenue to show that
assessee is specifically objecting the assessment order dated 21.02.2014 which
is passed u/s 144 read with section 144C(13) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. He
therefore, submitted that now the assessee cannot say that the order has not
been passed u/s 144 of the Act. He therefore, vehemently contested that order
has been passed by the Assessing Officer u/s 144 of the Act which has been
mentioned in the draft order passed by the AO on 31.03.2013 and final order
was in fact passed u/s 144 of the Act. He further referred to the various
objections by the assessee before the ld Dispute Resolution Panel and stated
that in none of the objections assessee has challenged the action of the ld
Assessing Officer of assuming jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act. He therefore
contended that assessee cannot take now the plea that order is passed by AO
u/s 143(3) of the Act. He stated that what is not contested before the lower
authorities cannot be taken as ground of appeal by the assessee. Only recourse
available to the assessee was by filing an additional ground of appeal which
has not been done. He took us to all the objections of the assessee before the
ld DRP. His contention was that the order passed by the ld AO is without
jurisdiction or barred by limitation of time was not at all contested by
assessee before ld DRP despite quite a lengthy remand proceedings before the
ld DRP. He therefore, contested that now there is no reason to agitate this
issue before the Tribunal. He further referred to page No. 983 of the paper
book which is the „ statement of facts‟ submitted by the assessee before the
ld DRP. He referred to page No. 977, 978, 979, 980, 981 of the paper book to
show that assessee has given a false statement before the lower authorities
that assessee has been granted the permission to not to include the necessary
details as required by the provisions of section 212 of the Companies Act. He
submitted that in the Directors Report for FY 2008-09 which was signed by the
Chairman and Managing Director of the company on 30.04.2009 it is stated that
company has been granted approval u/s 212(8) of the Act to not to include the
balance sheets, profit and loss account of the subsidiaries. He submitted a
paper book consisting of 35 pages to demonstrate the above issue. He drew our
attention to the relevant extract of sections 209 to section 212 of the
Companies Act which deals with the books of account as well as the disclosure
required to be made by the assessee. He further  30 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, referred to the relevant extract of the annual accounts of the
company which is also available at page No. 983 of paper Book Vol-III of the
Assessee. He further referred to the date of signing of such report by the
Chairman of the company, Dr. Pranoy Roy on 30.04.2009. Then he took us to the
approval granted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to the assessee u/s
212(8) of the Companies Act at page No. 34 and 35 of his paper book. He has
drawn our attention that Ministry of Corporate Affairs has granted approval to
the company only on 03.07.2009 whereas, the Director‟s Report of the company
dated 30.04.2009 states that Ministry of Corporate Affairs has granted
approval to the company u/s 212(8) of the Companies Act. He vehemently
referred to both the dates and pointed out that there is a false statement by
the company in its Director‟s Report dated 30.04.2009 claiming that it already
has such an approval when it was not even applied for. He further stated that
despite there being such an approval even on 03.07.2009 does not exempt
company from disclosing the information to various regulatory and Govt.
authorities. He therefore, submitted that claim of the company falls flat as
on 30.04.2009 it did not have any exemption and further the exemption was not
with respect to disclosure to Govt. authorities. He vehemently stated that
annual accounts of the company create serious doubts as it is apparently
backdated. He further referred to page No. 989 of the paper book where there
is reference to schedule 29 of the financial statement of the company for the
year ended on 31.03.2009 which contains notes on accounts with respect to
shareholders agreement dated 23.05.2008. He stated that the impugned
disclosure did show that 26% effective indirect stake has been given in
another subsidiary company of the assessee. However, the real issue is about
the amount of investment that has been made in the NDTV Networks International
Holding BV was not disclosed. He referred to the page No. 992 of the paper
book of the assessee to show that many of the details were submitted by the
assessee only as additional evidence before the ld DRP. He therefore,
submitted that the accounts of the assessee were not complete and correct and
hence are unreliable.
21\. He further relied upon the decision of special bench in case of M/s. All
cargo Global Logistics Ltd vs. DCIT dated 21.05.2012 to support his contention
that only option available with the assessee is to raise the issue of the
order being without jurisdiction and barred by limitation is by way of raising
an additional ground of  31 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, appeal, if
at all the appeal of the assessee is maintainable, which is not the case
before the bench. He further submitted that assessee has not disclosed vital
information by not complying with provisions of section 212 of The Companies
Act, 1956 and therefore, ld DRP has upheld the piercing of the corporate veil
in case of the assessee. He further submitted that therefore the AO rejected
the books of account of the assessee applying provision of section 145(3) of
the act and has assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act which is correct and
in accordance with law on the facts and circumstances of the case. He
therefore submitted that now it is unchallenged by the assessee that order is
in fact passed u/s 144 of the Act.
22\. He further submitted that assessee has also not complied the condition of
notice u/s 142(1) as mentioned at page No. 47 and 48 of the draft assessment
order. He submitted that the AO issued notice u/s 142(1) on 22.02.2011 asking
the assessee to furnish the copies of the balance sheet etc which assessee
submitted without the balance sheet, profit and loss account, audit report and
Director‟s report of the subsidiaries. Therefore, there was no submission of
any of such documents with respect to subsidiary furnished by the assessee. He
further submitted that by notice u/s 142(1) dated 15.02.2013 ld AO also asked
the similar detail wherein the assessee submitted the information of
subsidiaries except in case of NDTV Network PLC though mentioned in the
covering letter. Even by letter dated 11.03.2013 the balance sheet and profit
and loss account of NDTV Network PLC along with Profit and Loss account was
submitted but the notes on account of that subsidiary was never submitted
before the ld AO during the assessment proceedings. He further stated that
copy of share subscription agreement dated 23.05.2008 and identity,
creditworthiness and genuineness of the investor as well as the copy of the
balance sheet etc of the investee company were never submitted before the AO.
He submitted that as many as eight different types of documents were submitted
by the assessee as additional evidence before the ld DRP. He submitted that
information regarding investors in 100 million US$ step up coupon convertible
bonds was also not submitted despite the fact that most of the investors are
from tax heaven jurisdiction. Regarding the claim of the assessee that order
is time barred, he submitted that order is within time and assessee could not
show that how the order is barred by limitation by placing definite time
lines.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
23\. He further submitted that the order titled as draft Assessment order is
passed invoking provision of section 144 of the Act because the assessee has
failed to comply with the notice issued u/s 142(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
and further by virtue of second proviso to section 144(1) where the notice
under sub-section 142(1) has been issued prior to the making of an assessment
u/s 144 of the Act, It is not necessary to give any opportunity of hearing to
the assessee by issuing a show- cause notice to the assessee that why the
assessment should not be made u/s 144 of the Act. He further referred to the
provisions of section 145(3) of the Act that where the Assessing Officer is
not satisfied about the correctness or completeness of the accounts of the
assessee then the AO may make an assessment in the manner provided u/s 144 of
the Act. He therefore submitted that when AO has rightly invoked the
provisions of section 145(3) and also stated that as assessee has not
satisfied him about the correctness and completeness of the account the
provisions of section 144 has rightly been invoked.
24\. He further submitted that provisions of section 144C does not refer to
any on the specific section whether section 143(3) or section 144 of the Act,
therefore, according to the facts and circumstances of the each case the AO
may pass order under any of the above two sections. He therefore, vehemently
contested that claim of the assessee that Assessment order has been framed u/s
143(3) is devoid of any merit.
25\. Based on the above argument he further referred to the provision of
section 253(1)(d) of the Act which provides that an order passed by the AO u/s
143(3), 147, 153A and 153C in pursuance of the directions of the Dispute
Resolution Panel can be subject to appeal before the Tribunal. He therefore
submitted that there is no mention of orders passed u/s 144 of the Act being
appealable before the Tribunal even though they are passed in pursuance of
direction of the Dispute resolution panel. He therefore submitted that present
appeal of the assessee lacks jurisdiction before the tribunal. In the end he
submitted a detailed note on this issue as under:-
> ―The respondent has jurisdiction over the appellant, in respect of which
> case bearing ITA No.1212/Del/2014, ITA No.2658/Del/2014 & Co.No.233/Del/2014

2\. Facts of the case are stated briefly to have an appreciation of factual
and legal issue involved in the order of the Assessing Officer (the AO) in
case of M/s NDTV for AY 2009-10 u/s 144 r.w.s. 144 C(13) of the Act dated
21.02.2014. The assessee company filed its return of income for AY 2009-10 on
30.09.2009 declaring loss of (-) Rs.64, 83, 91,422/-.
The return was processed u/s 143(1) of the Act. Later on, the case was
selected for scrutiny assessment by issue and service of notice u/s 143(2) on
19.08.2010 followed by issue of several notices u/s 142(1) of the Act. The AO
after receipt of the directions of the DRP finalized assessment u/s 144 r.w.s
144C (13) of the Act on 28.02.2014 in conformity with the directions of the
DRP by determining total taxable income of Rs. 838.33 crore.
3\. The assessee filed an appeal against the said the assessment order of the
AO u/s 144 r.w.s. 144C (13) of the Act before Hon'ble ITAT u/s 253(1)(d) of
Act, even when no appeal against the order passed by the AO under section 144
of the Act in pursuance to the direction of the DRP is provided u/s 253(1)(d)
of the Act.
4\. For sake of clarity, relevant provisions of clause (d) of sub-section (1)
of section 253 of the Act is reproduced as under:
―an order passed by an Assessing Officer under sub-section (3), of section 143
or section 147 [or section 153A or section 153C] in pursuance of the
directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel or an order passed under section
154 in respect of such order‖
5\. The fact of completion of assessment under section 144 of the Act is
admitted by the appellant which fact is evidenced by relevant particulars in
Form No 36B read with Rule 14 of the I.T.Rules, 1962 & verified by & on behalf
of the appellant on March 3, 2014. It is pertinent to point out that even in
the appeal bearing ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 filed by the assessee before the
Hon'ble ITAT on 04.03.2014, the  34 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessee
has not taken any ground against the assumption of jurisdiction by the AO u/s
144which was also confirmed by the DRP.
6\. A question would thus arise as to whether an appealto the Appellate
Tribunal is provided against an order of the AO passed u/s 144 read with
section 144C(13) u/s 253 of the Act?
Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 253 of the Act deals with the
appellate jurisdiction of the ITAT against orders passed by the AO in
pursuance of the directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel, which reads as
under:
―[(d)an order passed by an Assessing Officer under sub-section(3), of section
143 or section 147 [or section 153A or section 153C] in pursuance of the
directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel or an order passed under section
154 in respect of such order;]‖ It is evident from the provision of section
253 (1) (d) that no appeal is provided against the order made by the AO u/s
144 of the Act in pursuance to the directions of the DRP.
7\. As against this, when one looks at the provisions of section 246A of the
Act providing appeals before Commissioner (Appeals), it provides appeals
against both classes of assessments, that under section 143(3) as well under
section 144 when aggrieved against such orders.
8\. It is pertinent to mention here that there is no inherent right of appeal
given to an assessee and no right of appeal can be created by way of
implication. This view gets support from judgement of Punjab and Haryana High
Court in case of CIT v. RamlalMansukhRai (1970) 77 ITR 964 (P&H)1. If the
right of appeal is not given by the statute, no appeal will lie,as upheld in
following cases:
 Harihar v. CIT 9 ITR 2462  Bhagat v. CIT 4 ITC 333  35 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, A right of appeal is the creature of the
statute and an assessee has right of appeal only if there is a statutory
provision for it, as held in following cases :
>  CIT v. Ashok Engineering 194 ITR 645 (SC)4  CIT v. Mahaveer Prasad & Sons
> (1980) 125 ITR (165 Del)5  Caltex Oil v. CIT 202 ITR 375 (Bom)6
9\. Right of appeal is not a vested right. This proposition of law is so
deeply embedded in the common law system that there is no exception to the
general rule. Thus whereas the appeal is a creation of statute, the manner in
which such appellate proceedings are determined is also provided for under the
law.
a) In KondibaDagaduKadam v. SavitribaiSopanGujar&Ors., AIR 1999 SC 22137,
Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:-
> ―It has to be kept in mind that the right of appeal is neither a natural nor
> an inherent right attached to the litigation. Being a substantive statutory
> right it has to be regulated in accordance with law in force at the relevant
> time. The conditions mentioned in the section must be strictly fulfilled
> before an appeal can be maintained and no Court has the power to add to or
> enlarge those grounds. The appeal cannot be decided on merit on merely
> equitable grounds.‖
> b) Further, there can be no quarrel that the right of appeal/revision cannot
> be absolute and the legislature can impose conditions for maintaining the
> same. In Vijay Prakash D. Mehta &Jawahar D. Mehta v. Collector of Customs
> (Preventive), Bombay, AIR 1988 SC 2010 8, Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:-
> ―Right to appeal is neither an absolute right noran ingredient of natural
> justice, the principles of which must be followed in all  36 ITA No.
> 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
> Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, judicial or quasi-judicial adjudications. The
> right to appeal is a statutory right and it can be circumscribed by the
> conditions in the grant ..............The purpose of the Section is to act
> in terrorem to make the people comply with the provisions of law.‖
> c) A similar view has been reiterated by Hon'ble Apex Court in Anant Mills
> Co. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1975 SC 1234 9; and Shyam Kishore &Ors. v.
> Municipal Corporation of Delhi &Anr., AIR 1992 SC 227910\. A Constitution
> Bench of this court in Nandlal&Anr. v. State of Haryana, AIR 1980 SC 209711,
> held that the ―right of appeal is a creature of statute and there is no
> reason why the legislature, while granting the right, cannot impose
> conditions for the exercise of such right so long as the conditions are not
> so onerous as to amount to unreasonable restrictions rendering the right
> almost illusory‖.
> d) In Gujarat Agro Industries Co. Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of the City
> of Ahmedabad &Ors., (1999) 4 SCC 46812, Hon'ble Apex Court held that the
> right of appeal though statutory, can be conditional/qualified and such a
> law cannot be held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. An
> appeal cannot be filed unless so provided for under the statute and when a
> law authorises filing of an appeal, it can impose conditions as well.
Thus, it is evident from the above that the right to appeal is a creation of
Statute and it cannot be created by acquiescence of the parties or by the
order of the Court. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by mere acceptance,
acquiescence, consent or by any other means as it can be conferred only by the
legislature and conferring a Court or Authority with jurisdiction, is a
legislative function. Thus, being a substantive statutory right, it has to be
regulated in accordance with the law in force, ensuring full compliance of the
conditions mentioned in the provision that creates it. Therefore, the Court
has  37 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, no power to enlarge the scope
of those grounds mentioned in the statutory provisions.
10\. The rule of strict interpretation was very recently explained by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT v. Calcutta Knitwears [2014] 362 ITR 673
(SC)13 as the foremost principle in interpretation of fiscal statutes, so that
where the statute is clear and unambiguous, the literal interpretation has
necessarily to follow as decided in the context of third-party jurisdiction in
a search under section 158BD after review of both English and Indian
precedents, in Swedish Match AB v. SEBI [2004] 122 Comp Cas 83 (SC); CIT v.
Ajax Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v. Simpson [1917] 24 CLR 209 and
Grundy v. Pinniger [1852] 1 L J Ch. 405. Hardship or inconvenience cannot also
justify a different interpretation in view of the judicial restraint against
the plain meaning of language employed by the Legislature.
In PrakashNathKhanna v. CIT [2004] 9 SCC 686 14, Hon'ble Apex court explained
that the language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of the
legislative intent. The Legislature is presumed to have made no mistake. The
presumption is that it intended to say what it has been said. Assuming there
is a defect or an omission in the words used by the Legislature, the court
cannot correct or make up the deficiency. Where the legislative intent is
clear from the language, the court should give effect to it (Delhi Financial
Corporation v. Rajiv Anand [2004] 11 SCC 62515
11\. The power of ITAT to admit an appeal u/s 253 has invited judicial
scrutiny by various benches of the ITAT in following cases:
11.1 Hon'ble ITAT-cochin bench examining the scope of provision of section 253
in case of The Sub Registrar V DIT I.T.A. No. 212/coch/2013 & S.A.42/coch/2013
order dated 24.7.201316 has held as under :
―5. Now coming to the direction given by the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence) in clause 7 of the demand notice, no doubt, the Director of  38
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Income-tax (Intelligence) mentioned in the
demand notice that an appeal can be filed before this Tribunal under Part B of
Chapter XX of the Income-tax Act. It is well settled principles of law that
consent of a litigant party will not confer any jurisdiction on a judicial or
quasi judicial authority unless and until it is otherwise conferred by the
legislature. Therefore, the consent / direction of the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence) will not confer any jurisdiction on this Tribunal unless it is
provided for in the Income-tax Act by the Parliament. Hence, this Tribunal
could not entertain the appeal filed by the Sub Registrar, Meppayur-Kozhikode.
6\. Coming to the contention of the ld.DR that appeal is provided u/s 246A(q)
of the Act, no doubt, an order imposing penalty under Chapter XXI is
appealable before the CIT(A) under section 246A(q) of the Act. Admittedly,
section 271FA falls in Chapter XXI of the Income-tax Act. Therefore, one may
claim that an appeal is provided u/s 246A(q) of the Act. We are conscious that
the CIT(A) is equivalent in rank that of the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence), therefore, the appeal before CIT(A) may not be an effective
and efficious remedy available to the Sub Registrar, Meppayur-Kozhikode
against whom penalty was levied. However, this Tribunal being a quasi judicial
authority established under the Income-tax Act, cannot travel beyond the
provisions of section 253 of the Act. Therefore, merely because the remedy
available u/s 246A(q) of the Act may not be effective and efficious that alone
will not give any jurisdiction to this Tribunal to entertain this appeal.
7\. Further, we are of the considered opinion that when the provisions of
section 271FA was introduced in the statute ITA No. 212/Coch/2013 S.A.
No.42/Coch/2013 book by the Finance Act, 2004 with effect from 01-04-2005 the
consequential amendment to section 253 was omitted to be carried out. This
omission may be unintended. One may argue that an appeal is provided against
the order of penalty u/s 271 in 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(c) of the Act, therefore,
all branches of section 271 i.e. from 271A to 271G are included in section.
This argument may not be correct because section 271 is an  39 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, independent section and it has its own sub
sections. Sections 271A to 271G are not sub sections under section 271 and
they are independent sections by themselves. This is obvious from section
253(1)(a) and 253(1)(c) itself. The legislature has mentioned sections 271 and
271A separately in section 253(1)(a) and 253 (1)(c) of the Act. Therefore, the
legislature treated sections 271 and 271A as separate and independent
sections. In other words, sections 271A to 271G are independent and separate
sections and it is not part / branch of sections 271 of the Act. Therefore,
argument, if any, that section 271FA is part of section 271 is not correct.
This Tribunal is of the considered opinion that section 271FA is separate and
independent of section 271 and therefore, the reference of section 271 in
section 253(1)(a) or 253(1)(c) may not be included section 271FA. As already
observed, the omission to include section 271FA in section 253 may be
unintended. Therefore, it is open to the department to bring to the notice of
the concerned authority about the omission to provide appeal before the
Tribunal for making consequential amendment to section 253 of the Act in case
the department found that the omission is unintended.
8\. In view of the above discussion, the appeal of the Sub Registrar,
Meppayur-Kozhikode is dismissed as not maintainable before this Tribunal.
However, it is made clear that it is open to the Sub Registrar, Meppayur-
Kozhikode to challenge the order passed by the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence) levying penalty u/s 271FA of the Act before the appropriate
forum in a manner known to law.‖ 11.2. Hon'ble ITAT-Cochin in its later

5\. Now coming to the direction given by the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence) in clause 7 of the demand notice, no doubt, the Director of
Income-tax (Intelligence) mentioned in the demand notice that an appeal can be
filed before this Tribunal under Part B of Chapter XX of the Income-tax Act.
It is well settled principles of law that consent of a litigant party will not
confer any jurisdiction on a judicial or quasi judicial authority unless and
until it is otherwise conferred by the legislature. Therefore, the
consent/direction of the Director of Income-tax (Intelligence) will not confer
any jurisdiction on this Tribunal unless it is provided for in the Income-tax
Act by the Parliament. Hence, this Tribunal could not entertain the appeal
filed by the Sub Registrar, Meppayur-Kozhikode.
6\. Coming to the contention of the ld. DR that appeal is provided u/s 246A(q)
of the Act, no doubt, an order imposing penalty under Chapter XXI is
appealable before the CIT(A) under section 246A(q) of the Act. Admittedly,
section 271FA falls in Chapter XXI of the Income-tax Act. Therefore, one may
claim that an appeal is provided u/s 246A(q) of the Act. We are conscious that
the CIT(A) is equivalent in rank that of the Director of Income-tax
(Intelligence), therefore, the appeal before CIT(A) may not be an effective
and efficacious remedy available to the Sub Registrar, Meppayur-Kozhikode
against whom penalty was levied. However, this Tribunal being a quasi judicial
authority established under the Income-tax Act, cannot travel beyond the
provisions of section 253 of the Act. Therefore, merely because the  42 ITA

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, remedy available u/s 246A(q) of the Act may not
be effective and efficacious that alone will not give any jurisdiction to this
Tribunal to entertain this appeal.
7\. Further, we are of the considered opinion that when the provisions of
section 271FA was introduced in the statute book by the Finance Act, 2004 with
effect from 01-04-2005 the consequential amendment to section 253 was omitted
to be carried out. This omission may be unintended. One may argue that an
appeal is provided against the order of penalty u/s 271 in 253(1)(a) and
253(1)(c) of the Act, therefore, all branches of section 271 i.e. from 271A to
271G are included in section. This argument may not be correct because section
271 is an independent section and it has its own sub sections. Sections 271A
to 271G are not sub sections under section 271 and they are independent
sections by themselves. This is obvious from section 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(c)
itself. The legislature has mentioned sections 271 and 271A separately in
section 253(1)(a) and 253 (1)(c) of the Act. Therefore, the legislature
treated sections 271 and 271A as separate and independent sections. In other
words, sections 271A to 271G are independent and separate sections and it is
not part/branch of sections 271 of the Act. Therefore, argument, if any, that
section 271FA is part of section 271 is not correct. This Tribunal is of the
considered opinion that section 271FA is separate and independent of section
271 and therefore, the reference of section 271 in section 253(1)(a) or
253(1)(c) may not be included section 271FA. As already observed, the omission
to include section 271FA in section 253 may be unintended. Therefore, it is
open to the department to bring to the notice of the concerned authority about
the omission to provide appeal before the Tribunal for making consequential
amendment to section 253 of the Act in case the department found that the
omission is unintended.‖ 11.3. Hon'ble ITAT-Hyderabad bench examining

4.1 In the instant case, memorandum of appeal is filed pursuant to directions
given by the DRP. A statutory right to file an appeal is provided under sub-
section (2A) of section 253 which reads as under :
> "[(2A)] The Commissioner may, if he objects to any direction issued by the
> Dispute Resolution Panel under sub-section (5) of section 144C in respect of
> any objection filed on or after the 1st day of July, 2012, by the assessee
> under sub- section (2) of section 144C in pursuance of which the Assessing
> Officer has passed an order completing the assessment or reassessment,
> direct the Assessing Officer to appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against the
> order.]"
4.2 This sub-section (2A) was introduced by the Finance Act, 2012 w.e.f.
01.07.2012. While inserting sub- section (2A) in Section 253, the legislature
has taken care to insert sub-section (3A) also, which specifies that the
appeal shall be filed within 60 days of the date on which the order sought to
be appealed against is passed by the AO pursuant to the directions to the DRP
under sub-section (5) of section 144C. Not only that, sub-section (4) also was
amended by inserting sub-section (2A) in sub-section (4) for filing of cross-
objections. This indicates that the legislature has consciously not amended
sub-section (6). Therefore, the contention of the Ld. CIT/DR that it could be
an omission or mistake in not amending the sub-section (6) for the appeals
preferred to in sub-section (2A) cannot be accepted. Since the legislature
intentionally has not exempted appeals in sub-section (2A), it can be  45 ITA
No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, concluded that the Assessing Officer's appeal
to the Appellate Tribunal shall be accompanied by a fee as prescribed under
clauses (a) to (d) of the provisions. As AO has not taken any steps to pay the
fees, in spite of being intimated to him in the acknowledgment itself, we have
no option than to reject the memorandum of appeals preferred, as not
maintainable.
4.3 Ld. D.R. also pointed out that ITAT can accept a Memorandum of Appeal by
using its discretion. Rule 9 of the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 provides in
discretion to the ITAT. Rule 9(3) is as under :
> "The Tribunal may in its discretion, accept a Memorandum of Appeal which is
> not accompanied by all or any of the documents referred to in sub-rule (1)."
4.4 As can be seen from the above, if the memorandum of appeal is deficient in
its enclosures, as prescribed, then only the Tribunal can exercise its
discretion to accept the memorandum of appeal. In the present appeals, the
enclosures are not defective but the fee payable as per the statutory
provisions of section 253(6) was not paid. Since the Memo of Appeal is not
accompanied by the fee, as prescribed, we are of the opinion that there is no
discretion to the ITAT to accept Memorandum of Appeal filed, in violation of
the statutory provisions. ITAT being a quasi-judicial body under the I.T. Act,
it has to follow the statutory provisions as prescribed. Under analogous
circumstances, while dealing with an appeal filed by an assessee against the
order passed under section 271FA, the ITAT, Cochin Bench in the case of Sub-
Registrar Office, Meppayur - Kozhikode v. DIT (Intelligence) [2013] 37
taxmann.com 36/[2014] 64 SOT 10 (URO) observed that the Tribunal cannot travel
beyond the provisions of the Act and cannot admit an appeal even if the
opponent party gives consent permitting the appellant to file an appeal. In
otherwords, the consent of a litigant party would not confer jurisdiction on a
quasi judicial authority unless and until it is otherwise conferred under the
statute.‖  46 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 11.4. The Chennai bench of
ITAT examining scope of section 253 in case of Intimate Fashion (India) (P)
Ltd. (2013) 31 Taxmann.com 306 19 has held as under :
―7. The contention of the assessee before us is that as no direction was given
by the DRP and consequently provisions of section 144C(13) are not applicable
in the instant case and therefore, as per the provisions of section 144C(3),
the assessment order should have been passed on or before 31.3.2012 and in
view of this, the impugned order dated 15.6.2012 is barred by limitation.
8\. We find that the orders against which appeal can be preferred before the
Tribunal are provided in section 253 of the Act. Section 253(1)(d) reads as
under:
> "an order passed by an Assessing Officer under sub-section (3), of section
> 143 or section 147[or section 153A or section 153C] in pursuance of the
> directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel or an order passed under section
> 154 in respect of such order."
9\. A bare perusal of the provision shows that the order passed u/s 143(3) by
the Assessing Officer when such order is passed in pursuance of the directions
of the DRP only shall be appealable before the Tribunal and in case of an
order passed u/s 143(3) by the Assessing Officer which is not in pursuance to
the directions of the DRP, appeal shall not lie against such order directly
before the Tribunal.
10\. In the instant case, the contention of the A.R of the assessee is that
the impugned order passed u/s 143(3) by the Assessing Officer is not an order
which is passed in pursuance of the directions of the DRP. However, if the
above contention of the assessee is taken as correct then it implies that the
47 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessee is not entitled to file
directly appeal before the Tribunal in pursuance to such an order of the
Assessing Officer passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. We find that the DRP has
categorically stated that it has no jurisdiction to pass any direction in
pursuance to the belated objections filed by the assessee against the draft
order of the Assessing Officer and in fact, the Panel gave no direction in
respect of objections of the assessee. It is also observed that the DRP has
also not given any direction to pass the order as per the draft assessment
order. In the above circumstances, in our considered view, the instant appeal
is not covered by the provisions of section 253(1)(d) of the Act and the
instant appeal is not maintainable. We, therefore, decline to admit the
instant appeal and dismiss the same in limine.‖ 11.5. The Amritsar bench of
ITAT in case of Sub-Registrar, Nakoar v DIT (2012) Taxmann.com 22520 examining
identical issue of power of ITAT u/s 253 of the Act has held as under :
―6.1 From the above, it is clear that no power to entertain the appeals
against the order passed under s. 271FA, has been provided to the Tribunal.
Therefore, the appeals cannot be entertained by the Tribunal. On the other
hand, the powers have been given to the CIT(A) under s. 246A(l)(q), which
reads as under :
"246A(1)(q) : An assessee aggrieved by any of the following orders (whether
made before or after the appointed day) may appeal to the CIT(A) against :
(q)an order imposing a penalty under Chapter XXI."
6.2 In view of the clear provisions of s. 246A(l)(q) of the Act, an appeal
against the order passed under Chapter XXI can be preferred before the CIT(A).
The provisions of s. 271FA falls under the Chapter XXI of the Act. Thus, in
view of the clear and unambiguous provisions of the Act, these appeals cannot
be admitted by us, particularly, when, we have no jurisdiction under the law
to entertain such appeals. Consequently, we dismiss all the appeals, for want
of jurisdiction.‖  48 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.

Hon'ble ITAT-Delhi bench has also examined power of ITAT u/s 253 of the Act in
case of SIS live v ACIT(2016) 65 Taxmann.com10 21 as under:
―11. Now let us take stock of the legal position about the filing of appeal by
the Revenue against the assessment order passed pursuant to the direction
given by the DRP. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the institution
of the DRP came into being by means of insertion of section 144C by the
Finance (No. 2) Act, 2009 w.e.f. 1.4.2009. As per this section, an assessee
who is dissatisfied with a draft order can approach the DRP for necessary
relief. Such a relief can be allowed by giving direction under sub-section (5)
of this section. Sub-section (13) of section 144C provides that the AO is
obliged to pass a final assessment order in conformity with the direction
given by the DRP. This shows that the direction tendered by the DRP is binding
on the AO notwithstanding the AO's reservations on it. The Finance Act, 2012
inserted sub-section (2A) to section 253 w.e.f. 1.7.2012 providing that : 'The
Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may, if he objects to any direction
issued by the Dispute Resolution Panel under sub-section (5) of section 144C
in respect of any objection filed on or after the 1st day of July, 2012, by
the assessee under sub-section (2) of section 144C in pursuance of which the
Assessing Officer has passed an order completing the assessment or
reassessment, direct the Assessing Officer to appeal to the Appellate Tribunal
against the order.' This divulges that the AO was without any remedy to
challenge the unacceptable adverse direction given by the DRP, given effect to
in his own order, in respect of any objections filed before this cut-off date
of 1.7.2012. Now with this amendment, the Revenue has been given a liberty to
file appeal before the tribunal if the CIT objects to any direction issued by
the Dispute Resolution Panel, +that has been incorporated in the final
assessment order. The point to be underscored is that such a power of filing
appeal is restricted only to the cases where 'objection is to the direction of
the DRP' and not to the voluntary action of the AO/TPO himself. In other
words, if the AO/TPO has decided a point, which has been reversed by the DRP,
then an appeal  49 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, can be filed by the
Department against the assessment order on such point(s). The right to file an
appeal does not extend to a point decided either way by the AO/TPO himself,
which remains intact even after the direction given by the DRP.
12\. Similar is the position about filing a Cross objection by the Department,
which is covered under sub-section (4) of section 253. As per this provision
amended by the Finance Act, 2012,: 'The Assessing Officer ...., on receipt of
notice that an appeal against the order of .... the Assessing Officer in
pursuance of the directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel has been preferred
under sub-section (1) ..., may, notwithstanding that he may not have appealed
against such order or any part thereof; within thirty days of the receipt of
the notice, file a memorandum of cross-objections... against any part of the
order of the Assessing Officer (in pursuance of the directions of the Dispute
Resolution Panel).....'. It is manifest that the liberty to file cross
objection has been given to the AO u/s 253(4) of the Act only against that
part of the order of the Assessing Officer which is in pursuance of the
directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel. This provision does not encompass
a case of the AO filing cross objection against that part of the assessment
order which has not been disturbed by the DRP.‖ 11.7. A careful analysis of
above referred to legal jurisprudence on the issue has revealed that Hon'ble
ITAT examining scope of its power u/s 253 has laid down following principles:
(a) If an appeal is not covered by provisions of section 253 of the Act, the
appeal is not maintainable.
(b) The Tribunal being a quasi judicial authority established under the Income
Tax Act cannot travel beyond the provisions of section 253 of the Act.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(c) It is well settled principle of law that consent of a litigant party will
not confer any jurisdiction on a judicial or quasi judicial authority unless
and until it is otherwise conferred by the legislature.
(d) The Tribunal cannot travel beyond the provisions of the Act and cannot
admit an appeal even if the opponent party gives consent permitting the
appellant to file an appeal.
(e) Power of filing appeal against any direction issued by the Dispute
Resolution Panel to the ITAT is restricted to cases covered under provisions
of section 253(1)(d) and section 253 (2A) of the Act.
12\. Respectfully following the above referred to legal position that assessee
has right of appeal only if there is a statutory provision for it,it is
respectfully submitted that in this case, no appeal lies against the order of
the Assessing Officer passed u/s 144 read with section 144C (13) of the Act as
would be evident from a careful reading of clause (d) of sub-section (1) of
section 253 of the Act. Accordingly, it is prayed that appeal of the assessee
should not be entertained for adjudication and should be rejected on the
ground that no appeal is provided against the order passed by the Assessing
Officer in this case.
13\. To sum up: Following propositions are placed for kind consideration with
set of case laws on which reliance is placed in support thereof:

2\. Facts of the case are stated briefly to have an appreciation of factual
and legal issue involved in the order of the Assessing Officer (the AO) in
case of M/s NDTV for AY 2009-10 u/s 144 r.w.s. 144 C(13) of the Act dated
21.02.2014. The assessee company filed its return of income for AY 2009-10 on
30.09.2009 declaring loss of (-) Rs.64,83,91,422/-. The return was processed
u/s 143(1) of the Act. Later on, the case was selected for scrutiny assessment
by issue and service of notice u/s 143(2) on 19.08.2010 followed by issue of
several notices u/s 142(1) of the Act. During course of scrutiny assessment
proceedings, the  52 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessee
furnished partial information and did not comply with terms and conditions of
notices u/s 142(1) of the Act on certain issues. The assessee was also found
contravening provisions of section 145(2) of the Act. After considering
replies and arguments as filed on behalf of the assessee, a show cause notice
was issued to the assessee to show cause as why assessment should not be
completed u/s 144 of the Act. After giving opportunity of being heard and
considering objection/replies of the assessee, the AO assumed jurisdiction u/s
144 of the Act as evidenced from last paragraph on page 48 of the draft
assessment order. A draft assessment was issued on 31.03.2013 u/s 144/144C(1)
of the Act proposing taxable income of Rs. 641.08 crore as against declared
loss of Rs. 64.83 crore . (It is to clarify here that due to typographic
mistake on first page of the order, section 143(3)/144C(1) of the Act was
wrongly mentioned as against correct section 144/144C(1) of the Act.) The
assessee filed objection u/s 144C before Hon'ble Dispute Resolution Panel (the
DRP) against the proposal of the AO to finalize assessment at Rs. 641.08 crore
as against declared loss of Rs. 64.83 crore u/s 144 of the Act. The DRP heard
the assessee and examined additional evidences field by the assessee and
caused further enquiries to be made u/s 144C(7) by directing the AO to send
remand reports. The DRP, taking into account proposal of additions to income
in draft assessment order, submissions by the assessee, remand reports of the
AO and non-submission of the information by the assessee on certain points,
issued directions u/s 144C(5) of the Act to the AO on 31.12.2013. It is
pertinent to mention here the assessee did not challenge assumption of the
jurisdiction by the AO u/s 144 of the Act, however, it did take a ground
against rejection of books of A/c, which was not pressed before the DRP and
was rejected after scrutiny by the DRP and the DRP confirmed assumption of
jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act. The DRP gave categorical findings on the
issue under the title "Non-disclosure of vital information" in paras 5.3 to
5.5 of its directions, which are reproduced verbatim as  53 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, under:-
"Non-disclosure of vital information 5.3. According to AO, as per Section 212
of the Companies Act, 1956 as well as the Indian Accounting Standards 7, 12,
18, 19, 27, 28, 33 and 107, the transactions of the subsidiaries were to be
consolidated and disclosed in the audited accounts of the assessee since it is
the parent company of all the Netherland and UK based companies On being
asked, the assessee produced a conditional order dated 03.07.2009 of the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs which exempted from attaching the details of
subsidiaries with its balance sheet and other accounts in terms of provision
of sub-section 8 of Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956. The AO has pointed
out that even this order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was not fully
complied with The assessee is a listed company. The disclosure of accounts
prescribed by Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was not adhered to
in spite of the fact that the assessee has committed so to do under listing
agreement with Stock Exchange. The order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
was issued on 03.07.2009 whereas the audited accounts of the assessee was
finalised much before that. In any case, this order exempting the assessee was
not retrospectively operative. Therefore, the lapses or omissions of not
making full and true disclosure in the audited accounts of the assessee were
not condoned by the exemption order of Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
5.4. The AO had asked for details about these transactions through her letters
during the course of the assessment proceedings. The AO has mentioned that the
requisite information was not produced before ADIT Investigation, Unit-ll(2),
New Delhi nor produced before her during the course of assessment proceedings.
Therefore, the AO has come to the following conclusion (which is narrated on
Page 46 of the  54 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, draft assessment order):
"As the material information which was required under the law to be attached
with the balance sheet of the assessee company was neither attached nor being
provided pursuant to summons issued by the Department in December 2010 nor in
response to notice issued in February 2013, a reasonable belief was formed
that the accounts of the assessee are not maintained and prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Standards issued by the Central Government and
were therefore incomplete and incorrect based upon which the true and correct
income of the assessee liable to tax cannot be determined."
5.5. A show cause notice was issued by the AO to the assessee u/s 145(3) of
the IT Act r/w relevant sections of the Companies Act by stating 'why the
books of accounts should not be rejected' in accordance with Section 144 of
the IT Act and why the assessment should not be concluded under that section.
Further, the AO also contended that the assessee has also failed to comply
with the requirements of Income Tax Act as well. On Page 46 to 48 of the draft
assessment order, the AO has given reasons for rejection of the books of
accounts of the assessee and why best judgment assessment u/s 144 of the IT
Act is warranted in this case. The AO issued show cause notice to the assessee
before resorting to Section 144 of the IT Act."
(Emphasis supplied) Further, in para 5.13 of its directions, the DRP
categorically held as under:-
"5.13 Therefore, DRP is of the considered view that the corporate veil needs
to be pierced in this case as has rightly been done by the AO. The action of
the AO to that extent is upheld."

3\. The assessee filed an appeal against the said the assessment order of the
AO u/s 144 r.w.s. 144C (13) of the Act before Hon'ble ITAT u/s 253(l)(d) of
Act, even when no appeal against the order passed by the AO under section 144
of the Act in pursuance to the direction of the DRP is provided u/s 253(l)(d)
of the Act. For shake of clarity relevant provisions of clause (d) of sub-
section (1) of section 253 of the Act is reproduced as under:
"an order passed by an Assessing Officer under sub-section (3), of section 143
or section 147 [or section 153A or section 153C] in pursuance of the
directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel or an order passed under section
154 in respect of such order"
4\. In this case the AO assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act by taking into
account non-compliance of terms and conditions of the notice u/s 142(1) of the
as well as by rejecting books of A/c of the assessee u/s 145(3) of the Act. It
is pertinent to point out that even in the appeal bearing ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 filed by the assessee before the Hon'ble ITAT on 04.03.2014, the
assessee has not taken any ground against the assumption of jurisdiction by
the AO u/s 144 as also confirmed by the DRP. Thus, the assessee admits that
assumption of  56 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, jurisdiction u/s 144 by
the AO was correct on facts and in law.
Non-compliance to terms and conditions of notice u/s 142(1) of the Act
5\. It is evident from the finding of facts as recorded in the assessment
order that the assessee had not complied with terms and conditions of notice
u/s 142(1) as mentioned at page 47/48 of the draft assessment order. Details
of non-compliance of notice u/s 142(1) are noted in Annexure 'A' to this
submission. In view of above, provisions of clause
(c) of subsection 1 of section 144 are also applicable and proviso to section
144(1) cannot be invoked in this case.
Reasons for rejection of books of A/c under section 145(3) of the Act
6\. It is evident from findings recorded by the AO in the assessment order
that the assessee had not followed Indian Auditing Standards as notified by
Central Government under the Companies Act, 1956 as well as Accounting
Standards as notified u/s 145(2) of the Act while filing audited A/c of the
assessee company. In this regard, a reference may be made to page 46 to 50 of
the draft assessment order. The instances of non-compliance by the assessee
have been summarized as under:
(a) The assessee did not attach audited P&L A/c, balance sheet and annual
reports of its subsidiary companies along with audited account of the assessee
company as well as along with return of income for the year under
consideration.
(b) The assessee did not make disclosure in terms of paragraph 4 of Accounting
Standard notified u/s 145(2) of the Act. [Kindly refer No.
9949(F.No.l32/7195-TPL) dated 25.01.1996]
(c) Annual accounts did not follow following Indian Accounting Standards as
notified by the Central Government:

7\. In view of above facts, that the assessee did not follow Accounting
Standards as notified u/s 145(2), a show cause notice was issued u/s 145(3) to
the assessee to show cause as to why books of accounts of the assessee should
not be rejected and assessment of the company should not completed u/s 144 of
the Act.? In response to the notice, the assessee argued that it was exempted
u/s 212(8) of Indian Companies Act, 1956 to attach the details of annual
audited accounts of the subsidiary companies. The claim of the assessee cannot
be accepted for following reasons:
• It is evident from the paragraph 4 of accounting standard as notified u/s
145(2) of the Act that the assessee was required to make complete disclosure
of all the material items including information about all the material facts
including transactions governed by substance over form. For the sake of
clarity the relevant part of notified accounting standard are reproduced as
under:
"4. Accounting policies adopted by an assessee should be such so as to
represent a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business,
profession or vocation in the financial statements prepared and presented on
the basis of such accounting policies. For this purpose, the major
considerations governing the selection and application of accounting policies
are following,  58 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014

8\. Even though these subsidiary companies were paper companies located in UK,
Mauritius, Netherland, Sweden, etc. having no office, employee and known
business activities, financial transactions worth several hundreds of crores
were routed through these subsidiary companies for benefit of NDTV Ltd. and
its management. However, the assessee had seriously restricted the probe by
the AO into the issue of substance over form by withholding information about
the subsidiary companies.
9\. It is pertinent to mention here that accounting standard notified under
section 145(2) provide that the accounting treatment and presentation in
financial statement of transactions and events should be governed by their
substance and not merely by legal form. However, the assessee neither followed
the disclosure norms nor had disclosed audited A/c, balance sheet, profit &
loss A/c and annual report of subsidiary paper companies in the return of
Income of the NDTV Ltd.
10\. Sub-sections (3A), (3B) and (3C) in section 211 of Companies Act 1956
(w.e.f Oct. 31, 1998) stipulate the profit and loss account and the balance
sheet have to comply with accounting standards. For this purpose, the
expressions "Accounting standards" shall mean to be the standards of
accounting recommended by the Institute of Chartered Accountants as may be
prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with National Advisory
Committee on Accounting Standards constituted under section 210A of Companies
Act 1956. Thus, the Accounting Standards are prescribed by the Central
Government and Accounting standards are now mandatory qua the companies and
non-compliance with these standards would lead to violation of section 211 of
the Companies Act in as much as the annual accounts may then not be regarded
as presenting a "True and  60 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, fair view".
It is evident from the order of the AO that the assessee had not followed
several Auditing Standards as prescribed by the Central Government as
contemplated by section 2(33) of the Companies Act 1956\.
11\. Examining importance of Accounting Standards as notified by Central
Government under Companies Act 1956, Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of J.K.
Industries Ltd. and another Vs Union of India and others (2008) 297 ITR 176
(SC) has held as under:
"Under section 211(3A) Accounting Standards framed by the National Advisory
Committee on Accounting Standards constituted under section 210A are now made
mandatory. Every company has to comply with the said standards. Similarly,
under section 227(3)(d), every auditor has to certify whether the profit and
loss account and Similarly, balance sheet comply with accounting standard
referred to in section 211(3C). Similarly, under section 211(1) the company
accounts have to reflect a "true ad fair" view of the state of affairs.
Therefore, the object behind insistence on compliance with the A.S. and "True
and fair" accrual is the presentation of accounts in a manner which would
reflect the true income/profit. One has, therefore, to look at the entire
scheme of the Companies Act. In our view, the provisions of the Companies Act
together with the rule framed by the Central Government constitute a complete
scheme. Without the rules, the Companies Act cannot be implemented. The
impugned rules framed under section 642 are a legitimate aid to construction
of the Companies Act as contemporanea exposition. Many of the provisions of
the Companies Act, like computation of book profit, net profit etc. cannot be
put into operation without the rules."
The Importance of Accounting standard for implementation of provisions of
Income Tax has also been accepted by Hon'ble Apex Court and High Courts in
following cases:

12\. Provisions of section 145(3) provide that be AO may proceed under section
145(3) under any of the following circumstances:
(a) Where he is not satisfied about the erectness or completeness of the
accounts; or
(b) Where method of accounting cash or mercantile has not been regularly
followed by the assessee; or
(c) Accounting standards as notified by Central Government has not been
regularly followed by the assessee In this case, it is evident from discussion
in proceedings paragraphs that the assessee had not followed Accounting
Standards as notified by Central Government. Accordingly, the AO had correctly
rejected books of account u/s 145(3) of the Act.
Whether the AO was justified in framing assessment u/s 144 read with section
144C(13) of the Act 1961
13\. In a case where the provisions of section 145(3) are attracted, the AO is
entitled to make an assessment in the manner as provided in section
144\. Provisions of section 144 stipulate that the AO after taking into
account all the relevant material which AO has gathered shall, after giving
the assessee an "opportunity of being heard" make the assessment of the total
income or loss to the best judgement and determine the sum payable by the
assessee on the basis of such  62 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
assessment. The Proviso to section 144(1) further explaining term used
"opportunity of being heard" stipulates that such opportunity shall be given
by the AO by serving a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a
date and time to be specified in the notice, why the assessment should not be
completed to best judgement. It was further provided that provisions of
Proviso to section 144(1) shall not apply where a notice under sub-section (1)
of section 142 has been issued prior to the making of an assessment under this
section.
14\. In this case, the AO, after rejecting books of A/c u/s 145(3) and taking
note of non-compliance to terms and conditions of the notice u/s 142(1),
assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act. However, due to typographical mistake
on first page of draft order, section 143(3) read with section 144C was
written instead of correct section 144 read with section 144C(1). However this
rectifiable mistake was corrected as evident from directions of DRP u/s
144C(5) of the Act. (in this regard, paragraph 2.2.1 of the assessment order
may be referred to).
15\. It is evident from above discussion that the assessee had neither
complied with the terms and conditions of the notice u/s 142(1) nor had
followed accounting standards as notified by Central Government, accordingly,
the AO assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act and finalized assessment
proceeding u/s 144 read with section 144C of the Act. This leads to an
irresistible conclusion that the AO has assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 on two
counts - one, rejection of books of A/c 145(3) and second, non- compliance of
terms and condition of notice u/s 142(1) of the Act.
16\. For aforestated reasons, an argument that the assessment order should
have been passed u/s 143(3) instead of section 144 of the Act is not found
tenable. It is pertinent to mention here that assumption of jurisdiction under
section 144 of the Act in cases of non-compliance of  63 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
& 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, notices u/s 142(1) is clearly stipulated by clause (c) of
subsection 1 of section 144 of the Act and assumption of jurisdiction u/s 144
due to rejection of books of A/c u/s 145 (3) is provided under section 145(3)
of the Act by including wordings "...the Assessing Officer may make an
assessment in manner provided in section 144".
17\. Several Courts including Hon'ble Apex Court have approved assessment u/s
144 in cases where books of A/cs were rejected u/s 145(3) of the Act which may
be summarized as under:
    •      Kachwala Gems vs. JCIT, Jaipur 288 ITR 10 (SC)
    •      Bastiram Narayan Das vs. CIT (1994) 210 ITR 438 (Bom)
    •      GundaSubahiya vs. CIT (1939) 7 ITR 21 (Mad-FB)
    •      Amitabh Construction P. Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT (2011) 335 ITR 523 (Jhar)
For the reasons mentioned in above paragraph 4 to 17, it is concluded that the
AO was legally justified in passing assessment order u/s 144 read with section
144C(13) of the Act.
18\. Issue 1: Whether order of the AO u/s 144 r.w.s. 144C(13) is barred by
limitation • In this case, the assessee filed return of income on 30.09.2009
and later on a reference was made to Transfer Pricing Office u/s 92CA(1) of
the Act, accordingly, as per second Proviso to section 153(1) the time limit
to complete assessment was 31.03.2013. Since, in this case, the AO had
proposed variation in the return income of the assessee included variation in
the return of income as a consequence of the order of the TPO u/s 92CA(3) the
provisions of section 144C were applicable, accordingly, the AO frame a draft
assessment order on 30.03.2013 within time limit as stipulated in second
Proviso to section  64 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 153(1) and
further time limit to pass the order as stipulated u/s 144C was followed by
the AO. In view of these facts, it is incorrect to argue that last date of
passing final assessment order in this case was 31.03.2013 as against this in
this case last date to pass order in compliance to the direction of the DRP
was 28.02.2014 u/s 144C read with second Proviso to section 153(1) of the Act.
19\. Issue 2: Whether provisions of section 144C is not applicable to draft
order u/s 144 of the Act • The argument of the assessee that provisions of
section 144C are not applicable to the draft order u/s 144 is legally
incorrect statement. Clause(b) of sub-section (15) of section 144C stipulates
that provisions of section 144C are applicable to:
          -       All the cases of foreign company
          -      All the cases where variation in the income arise due to transfer
                 pricing additions
It is evident from provisions of section 144C of the Act that a proposed order
of assessment where variation in return of income of above referred to classes
of assessee known as eligible assessee are proposed are covered u/s 144C. The
proposed order of assessment may be u/s 143(3), 147 or section 144 of the Act.
The provisions of section 144C do not exclude proposed order of assessment u/s
144 of the Act as incorrectly argued by the AR of the assessee.
20\. Issue 3: Whether the draft assessment order and final order were u/s 144
of the Act • Facts of the case are stated briefly to have an appreciation of
factual and legal issue involved in the order of the Assessing  65 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Officer (the AO) in case of M/s NDTV for AY
2009-10 u/s 144 r.w.s. 144 C(13) of the Act dated 21.02.2014. The assessee
company filed its return of income for AY 2009- 10 on 30.09.2009declaring loss
of (-)Rs.64,83,91,422/-. The return was processed u/s 143(1) of the Act. Later
on, the case was selected for scrutiny assessment by issue and service of
notice u/s 143(2) on 19.08.2010 followed by issue of several notices u/s
142(1) of the Act. During course of scrutiny assessment proceedings, the
assessee furnished partial information and did not comply with terms and
conditions of notices u/s 142(1) of the Act on certain issues. The assessee
was also found contravening provisions of section 145(2) of the Act. After
considering replies and arguments as filed on behalf of the assessee, a show
cause notice was issued to the assessee to show cause as why assessment should
not be completed u/s 144 of the Act. After giving opportunity of being heard
and considering objection/replies of the assessee, the AO assumed jurisdiction
u/s 144 of the Act as evidenced from last paragraph on page 48 of the draft
assessment order. A draft assessment was issued on 31.03.2013 u/s 144/144C(1)
of the Act proposing taxable income of Rs. 641.08 crore as against declared
loss of Rs. 64.83 crore . (It is to clarify here that due to typographic
mistake on first page of the order, section 143(3)/144C(1) of the Act was
wrongly mentioned as against correct section 144/144C(1) of the Act.) The
assessee filed objection u/s 144C before Hon'ble Dispute Resolution Panel (the
DRP) against the proposal of the AO to finalize assessment at Rs. 641.08 crore
as against declared loss of Rs. 64.83 crore u/s 144 of the Act. The DRP heard
the assessee and examined additional evidences field by the assessee and
caused further enquiries to be made u/s 144C(7) by directing the AO to send
remand reports. The DRP, taking into account proposal of additions to income
in draft  66 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessment order, submissions
by the assessee, remand reports of the AO and non-submission of the
information by the assessee on certain points, issued directions u/s 144C(5)
of the Act to the AO on 31.12.2013. It is pertinent to mention here the
assessee did not challenge assumption of the jurisdiction by the AO u/s 144 of
the Act, however, it did take a ground against rejection of books of A/c,
which was not pressed before the DRP and was rejected after scrutiny by the
DRP and the DRP confirmed assumption of jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act. The
DRP gave categorical findings on the issue under the title "Non- disclosure of
vital information" in paras 5.3 to 5.5 of its directions, which are reproduced
verbatim as under:-
"Non-disclosure of vital information 5.3. According to AO, as per Section 212
of the Companies Act, 1956 as well as the Indian Accounting Standards
7,12,18,19, 27, 28, 33 and 107, the transactions of the subsidiaries were to
be consolidated and disclosed in the audited accounts of the assessee since it
is the parent company of all the Netherland and UK based companies. On being
asked, the assessee produced a conditional order dated 03.07.2009 of the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs which exempted from attaching the details of
subsidiaries with its balance sheet and other accounts in terms of provision
of sub-section 8 of Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956. The AO has pointed
out that even this order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was not fully
complied with. The assessee is a listed company. The disclosure of accounts
prescribed by Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was not adhered to
in spite of the fact that the assessee has committed so to do under listing
agreement with Stock Exchange. The order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
was issued on 03.07.2009 whereas the audited accounts of the assessee was
finalised much before that. In  67 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, any
case, this order exempting the assessee was not retrospectively operative.
Therefore, the lapses or omissions of not making full and true disclosure in
the audited accounts of the assessee were not condoned by the exemption order
of Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
5.4. The AO had asked for details about these transactions through her letters
during the course of the assessment proceedings. The AO has mentioned that the
requisite information was not produced before ADIT Investigation, Unit-ll(2),
New Delhi nor produced before her during the course of assessment proceedings.
Therefore, the AO has come to the following conclusion (which is narrated on
Page 46 of the draft assessment order):
> "As the material information which was required under the law to be attached
> with the balance sheet of the assessee company was neither attached nor
> being provided pursuant to summons issued by the Department in December 2010
> nor in response to notice issued in February 2013, a reasonable belief was
> formed that the accounts of the assessee are not maintained and prepared in
> accordance with the Accounting Standards issued by the Central Government
> and were therefore incomplete and incorrect based upon which the true and
> correct income of the assessee liable to tax cannot be determined."
5.5. A show cause notice was issued by the AO to the assessee u/s 145(3) of
the IT Act r/w relevant sections of the Companies Act by stating 'why the
books of accounts should not be rejected' in accordance with Section 144 of
the IT Act and why the assessment should not be concluded under that section.
Further, the AO also contended that the assessee has also failed to comply
with the requirements of Income Tax Act as well. On Page 46 to 48 of the draft
assessment order, the AO has given reasons for rejection of the books of
accounts of the assessee and why best judgment assessment u/s  68 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 144 of the IT Act is warranted in this case.
The AO issued show cause notice to the assessee before resorting to Section
144 of the IT Act."
> (Emphasis supplied) Further, in para 5.13 of its directions, the DRP
> categorically held asunder:-
> "5.13 Therefore, DRP is of the considered view that the corporate veil needs

> Corporate veil cannot be pierced without rejecting the account books of the

21\. Issue 4: Whether application of provision of section 145(3) will lead to
assessment u/s 144 of the Act • In a case where the provisions of section
145(3) are attracted, the AO is entitled to make an assessment in the manner
as provided in section
144\. Provisions of section 144 stipulate that the AO after taking into
account all the relevant material which AO has gathered shall, after giving
the assessee an "opportunity of being heard" make the assessment of the total
income or loss to the best judgement and determine the sum payable by the
assessee on the basis of such assessment. The Proviso to section 144(1)
further explaining term used "opportunity of being heard" stipulates that such
opportunity shall be given by the AO by serving a notice calling upon the
assessee to show cause, on a date and time to be specified in the notice, why
the assessment should not be completed to best judgement. It was further
provided that provisions of Proviso to section 144(1) shall not apply where a
notice under sub-section (1) of section 142 has been issued prior to the
making of an assessment under this section.
• In this case, the AO, after rejecting books of A/c u/s 145(3) and taking
note of non-compliance to terms and conditions of the notice u/s 142(1),
assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act as discussed in last paragraph on page
48 of the draft assessment order. However, due to typographical mistake on
first page of draft order, section 143(3) read with section 144C was written
instead of correct section 144 read with section 144C(1). However this
rectifiable mistake was corrected as evident from directions of DRP u/s
144C(5) of the Act. (in this regard, paragraph 2.2.1 of the assessment order
may be referred to).

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, • It is evident from above discussion that
the assessee had neither complied with the terms and conditions of the notice
u/s 142(1) nor had followed accounting standards as notified by Central
Government, accordingly, the AO assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act and
finalized assessment proceeding u/s 144 read with section 144C of the Act.
This leads to an irresistible conclusion that the AO has assumed jurisdiction
u/s 144 on two counts - one, rejection of books of A/c 145(3) and second, non-
compliance of terms and condition of notice u/s 142(1) of the Act.
• For aforestated reasons, an argument that the assessment order should have
been passed u/s 143(3) instead of section 144 of the Act is not found tenable.
It is pertinent to mention here that assumption of jurisdiction under section
144 of the Act in cases of non-compliance of notices u/s 142(1) is clearly
stipulated by clause (c) of subsection 1 of section 144 of the Act and
assumption of jurisdiction u/s 144 due to rejection of books of A/c u/s 145
(3) is provided under section 145(3) of the Act by including wordings "...the
Assessing Officer may make an assessment in manner provided in section 144".
• Several Courts including Hon'ble Apex Court have approved assessment u/s 144
in cases where books of A/cs were rejected u/s 145(3) of the Act which may be
summarized as under:
          •      Kachwala Gems vs. JCIT, Jaipur 288 ITR 10 (SC)

M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, passing assessment order u/s 144 read
with section 144C(13) of the Act.
Prayer:
21\. In view of above, it is humbly stated that appeal of the assessee company
against order of the AO u/s 144 r.w.s 144C (13) of the Act may be dismissed as
being beyond jurisdiction.
Annexure-A Note in the case of NDTV regarding non-compliance before the AO and
before the DRP
1\. Non-compliance of section 142(1) before the AO 1.1 During the assessment
proceedings for AY 2009-10, the AO issued notice u/s 142(1) on 22.02.2011,
wherein the assessee was required to furnish copies of Balance Sheet, Profit &
Loss account, Tax Audit Report with annexures by 28.02.2011. The word 'Balance
Sheet' is not defined in the Income Tax Act, 1961. As per the provisions of
section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956 as these stood at the relevant period,
the Balance Sheet of a holding company shall include copies of the balance
sheet, profit and loss account, report of Board of directors and report of
auditors, in respect of each of its subsidiaries. However, no such documents
in respect of any subsidiary was furnished by the assessee.
1.2 Vide notice u/s 142(1) dated 15.02.2013, the AO specifically required the
assessee to furnish Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss account, Audit Report, Notes
on accounts along with supporting annexures in respect of all subsidiaries of
the assessee. The information was sought by 22.02.2013. In response, vide
letter dated 27.02.2013, the assessee furnished information  72 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, regarding subsidiaries, but the information
regarding NDTV Networks Pic, UK (―NNPLC‖) was not enclosed, although it was
incorrectly written in the forwarding letter that information regarding NNPLC
was enclosed.
1.3 Vide further reply dated 11.03.2013, the assessee filed copies of Balance
Sheet and Profit & Loss account of NNPLC, but the ‗Notes on accounts', which
is the key to understanding the financials, was not furnished. The ‗Notes on
accounts' of NNPLC was not furnished by the assessee even till the completion
of the assessment proceedings.
1.4 The AO therefore issued show cause notice u/s 145(3) on 28.03.2013
specifically pointing out that the requisite information had not been
furnished by the assessee. In response, vide reply dated 28.03.2013 filed on
30.03.2013, the assessee stated that the information regarding subsidiaries
had not been filed earlier or attached with the Annual Report, because the
assessee had obtained exemption u/s 212(8) of the Companies Act, 1956. The
contention is not acceptable, because order u/s 212(8) was issued by the MCA
on 03.07.2009, whereas Annual Report was signed on 30.04.2009. Further, para
(v) of the exemption order mandates filing of such data to various regulatory
and government authorities as may be required by them.
1.5 Apart from the above, the following documents were not furnished by the
assessee during the assessment proceedings :-
> (i) Copy of Share Subscription Agreement dated 23.05.2008 between Universal

27\. The ld AR in rejoinder submitted that the assessee filed return of income
on 30.09.2009 and the Transfer Pricing Officer passed u/s 92CA(3) on
30.01.2013 and consequently draft assessment order was passed on 31.03.2013
wherein, the ld Assessing Officer himself has mentioned that order is passed
u/s 143(3) of the Act. He further referred to page No. 914 of the paper book,
which is Form NO. 35A of objections to the draft order before the ld DRP were
submitted to show that in the fifth column the details mentioned is that the
draft order is passed u/s 143(3) read with Section 144C of the Act. He
therefore submitted that as the draft order was not passed u/s 144 of the Act
there was no occasion to mention such section in that Form. With respect to
Form NO. 36B he submitted that as the assessment order is passed u/s 144 the
assessee does not have any option but to mention that section only. He
therefore vehemently stated that Revenue is misleading by quoting different
sections in the orders and now trying to argue that appeal is not
maintainable. He vehemently referred to the letter of the Assessing Officer
forwarding the draft assessment order. He further referred to the provisions
of section 144C of the Act to say that before the ld DRP only variations in
the income or loss returned can be challenged and as the objection was not
challengeable with respect to the order u/s  75 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 143(3) or section 144 as these are not variation to income
returned. He therefore submitted that there was no occasion for the assessee
to challenge and further there are no circumstances, which could entitle the
assessee to challenge the observation of the AO of invoking the provision of
section 144 before the ld DRP. He further submitted that assessee has
disclosed complete investment as per page No. 926 of the paper book in its
subsidiaries. Therefore, there was no circumstances exists to invoke the
provisions of section 145(3) of section 144 of the Act. He further stated that
annexure A of the submission of the ld DR with respect to the balance sheet
not including the balance sheets of the subsidiaries. He referred to the
decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in case of 39 ITR 202 specifically at
page No. 208 in Charan Das Haridas and Another Vs. CIT to state that the
assessee company and its subsidiary companies are different and it does not
change the position of income tax of assessee if the accounts of subsidiaries
are not available. He submitted that in the present case the ld Assessing
Officer should have looked into the income tax laws and not the Companies Act,
1956.
28\. He further referred with respect to the controversy in the dates of the
approval by the MCA i.e. 03.07.2009 and the date of the board of Director‟s
report dated 30.04.2009 he submitted that annual accounts were printed on
22.07.2009 and therefore, by that date the approval was available. Hence, he
submitted that allegations of the Revenue with respect to the dates is
incorrect and irrelevant for deciding whether the accounts are correct and
complete. He further submitted note dated 04.07.2017 to address the above
controversy as under:-
> 1\. That at the time of hearing, on 04.07.2017, the appellant had been
> directed to provide the copy of the minutes maintained under the Companies

> 2\. .That appellant at the outset respectfully submits that the pages 1746-
> 1859 of Paper Book  76 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
> 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Volume-V,

> a. Copy the index to the annual report (page 1746-1748);
b. Details of Board of Directors, Auditors, Compliance Officer, Company
Secretary, Performance indicators (Page 1749-1753);
c. Letter to shareholders dated 22.07.2009 (Pages 1754-1755);
d. Directors Report dated 30.04.2009 (Pages 1757-1764);
e. Corporate Governance Report dated 30.04.2009 (Pages 1765-
1778);
f. Management Analysis (Pages 1779-1790);
Auditors Report (Pages 1791-1793);
h. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account along with schedules
(Pages 1794-1823);
i. Consolidated Financial Statement of the appellant and subsidiaries duly
audited on 30.04.2009 (Pages 1825-1857);
3\. From the above, it is apparent that pages 1825 to 1857 are consolidated
financial statement of the appellant company. It is submitted that out of the
above, page 1825 is the Auditors Report to the Board of Directors dated
30.04.2009 on the Consolidated Financial Statement of the appellant Company
and its subsidiaries. In this report, it has been stated that "We have audited
the attached consolidated Balance Sheet of New Delhi Television Limited and
its subsidiaries as at March 31, 2009, the Consolidated Profit & Loss Account
for the year ended on that date annexed thereto...".
4\. In view thereof, there was no non compliance of section 212(8) of the
Companies Act, 1956.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
5\. Without prejudice, it is submitted that section 212(8) of the Companies
Act, 1956 is a procedural Section and in February, 2011, the Ministry of
Corporate affairs issued a general notification granting general exemption to
all the companies under section 212(8) of the Companies Act, 1956.
6\. Intact, in the instant case, the Board of Directors had having regard to
the procedural requirements, made an application on 08.05.2009, to the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs to grant an approval for waiving publication of
the individual financial statement of subsidiaries, which was also granted on
03.07.2009.
7\. Having regard to the above, the appellant respectfully submits that once
the Ministry of Corporate affairs has specific exemption in respect of the
publication of the individual financial statement of subsidiaries, after
considering the consolidated audited financial statement, no adverse inference
can be validly drawn vis a vis section 212(8) of the Companies Act, 1956 and
that too under the proceedings under the Income Tax Act, 1961. It is submitted
that Income Tax Act and Companies Act operate in different field and therefore
in view of the judgment of the Apex court in the cases of CharandasHaridas v.
CIT reported in 39 ITR 202, and Coca Cola Export Corporation vs. ITO reported
in 231 ITR 200, section 212(8) of the Companies Act has no application.
8\. It is also submitted that even the learned AO has found no defect
whatsoever in the consolidated financial statement of the appellant company.
In view of the above and the fact that exemption granted on 03.07.2009 was
available on the date of AGM held on 22.07.2009, it is most respectfully
submitted that the contention of the revenue to invoke section 145(3) of the
Act on the pretext of section 212(8) of the Companies Act has no valid
justification.
9\. It is also clarified that as the accounts of all the companies were  78
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, audited before 30.04.2009 and consolidated
accounts were also prepared, inadvertently in corporate governance report it
was stated that the Government of India has granted approval waiving the
publication of the financial statement of the subsidiaries. In the application
was made on 08.05.2009 and approval was also granted on 03.07.2009, as stated
aforesaid which is prior to the AGM and also the date of filing of the return
for the instant year and much prior to the draft of the proposed order of
assessment dated 31.03.2013.
10\. Further, as directed by the Hon'ble Bench, copy of the minutes maintained
under the Companies Act, 1956 shall be produced in original by tomorrow
morning.‖
29\. He further submitted that before the ld DRP the Revenue had several
occasions in remand as well as personal appearance but this objection was
never raised there that order is not u/s 143(3) but u/s 144 of the Act. He
therefore, submitted that in absence of any whisper by the Revenue now it
could not contest that order is passed u/s 144 of the Act. He further
submitted that decision of the coordinate bench in case of Allcargo Logistics
Ltd has no application to the fact of the present case. He further stated that
there is no evidence of non-compliance by the Assessing Officer as well as in
the draft order or in final order. Therefore, now Revenue cannot say that
there was noncompliance. He further stated that the draft order is passed u/s
143(3) of the Act by the AO otherwise there would have not been any reason to
file an objection before the ld DRP and had it been so assessee would have
approached the ld CIT(A).
30\. In the end he referred to his final written submission page no 192 to 197
of his written submission as under:-
> 41 GROUND NO. 1 OF GROUNDS OF APPEAL: THAT FURTHER MORE ASSESSMENT MADE IS
> WITHOUT JURISDICTION AS WELL AS BARRED BY LIMITATION 41.1 In this grounds of
> appeal, the appellant has challenged the validity of  79 ITA No.
> 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
> Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, instant assessment.
41.2 It is submitted that in this case a draft order dated 31.3.2013 was
framed which was titled as ―Draft Order u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of
the I.T. Act.‖ However in the remand report dated 11.12.2013 (pages 118 of
Appeal Set) the learned Assessing Officer had stated that in the draft
assessment order, the learned Assessing Officer has expressly invoked the
provisions of section 145(3) of the Act and assumed jurisdiction u/s 144 of
the Act by rejecting the books of accounts of the assessee and has given a
specific finding in this regard at pages: 48 and 49 of the said order(pages
1-62 of Appeal Set). He further submitted that while passing the draft order
on 31.3.2013, in the relevant column at the first page, the AO has mentioned
the order as passed u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act, which is
mistake apparent from record. In his submission, the correct words of the
order would be ―section 144 read with section 144C(1) of the I.T. Act' 1961‖.
41.3 It is thus submitted that the learned Assessing Officer had alleged in
his report at page 118 (para 2.2) that since the learned Assessing Officer had
expressly invoked the provisions of section 145(3) of the Act and rejected
books of account of the appellant company, the assessment had been made u/s
144 of the Act. It is submitted that if it is so, then the said order cannot
be regarded as any draft order under the Act. It is submitted that when an
assessment is made u/s 144 of the Act, the same is not subject to section 144C
of the Act since while framing an assessment u/s 144 of the Act, he had to
compute income to the best of his judgment and determine sum payable on the
basis of such assessment; whereas in order dated 31.3.2013 he had stated the
order to be draft order and no such sum was determined by him. There is a
conceptual difference between an order where an assessment has been made to
best of his judgment and a draft order 41.4 It is submitted that where a draft
assessment order is made sum of tax payable is not determined and therefore in
absence of any determination of tax, the draft order of assessment is not an
order u/s 144 of the Act. It is submitted that this is also evident from
provisions contained in section 145(3) of the Act, which read as under:
> ―(3) Where the Assessing Officer is not satisfied about the correctness or
> completeness of the accounts of the assessee, or where the method of
> accounting provided in sub-section (1) or accounting standards as notified
> under sub-section (2) , have not been regularly followed by the assessee,
> the Assessing Officer may make an assessment in the manner provided in
> section 144. ― [Emphasis supplied 41.5 It will be evident from the aforesaid
> statutory provisions that invocation of provisions contained in section
> 145(3) of the Act does not tantamount to an order of assessment u/s 144 of
> the Act. It only provides that assessment has to be made in the manner
> provided u/s  80 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
> (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 144 of the Act. The
> aforesaid submission is also supported by provisions contained in section
> 246A of the Act which reads as under:
> (1) Any assessee or any deductor aggrieved]15 by any of the following orders
> (whether made before or after the appointed day) may appeal to the
> Commissioner (Appeals) against -
> (a) an order passed by a Joint Commissioner under clause (ii) of sub-section
> (3) of section 115VP or an order against the assessee] where the assessee
> denies his liability to be assessed under this Act or an intimation under
> sub-section (1) or sub-section (1B) of [section 143 or sub-section (1) of
> section 200A, where the assessee or the deductor objects] to the making of
> adjustments, or any order of assessment [under sub-section (3) of section
> 143 [except an order passed in pursuance of directions of the Dispute
> Resolution Panel [or an order referred to in sub-section (12) of section
> 144BA][***] or section 144, to the income assessed, or to the amount of tax
> determined, or to the amount of loss computed, or to the status under which
> he is assessed‖ [Emphasis supplied] 41.6 In light of the above, the first
> submission of the appellant is that order dated 31.3.2013 was an order u/s
> 143(3) of the Act read with section 144C of the Act and was a draft order of
> assessment. The finding that the said order was an order u/s 144 of the Act
> is factually and legally misconceived and hence untenable.
41.7 Without prejudice for the sake of an argument assuming the said order was
an order u/s 144 of the Act, then the instant order dated 21.2.2014 is barred
by limitation and deserves to be quashed altogether. The appellant also seeks
to place reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
CIT vs. Purshottamdas T. Patel reported in 209 ITR 52 wherein it has been held
as under:
> ―In our opinion, this decision, far from helping the Revenue, goes against
> it. The Supreme Court has in terms stated that assessment is one integrated
> process involving not only the assessment of the total income but also the
> determination of the tax. It has further observed that the latter is as
> crucial as the former. Therefore, unless the total income is determined and
> the determination of tax is also done, it cannot be said that the process of
> assessment is complete. What section 153 requires is that the assessment
> should be completed within the prescribed time-limit. The words "Order of
> assessment" cannot be construed to mean assessment of total income only.
> Those words would mean an Order in writing whereby the total income of the
> assessee is assessed and the tax payable by him is determined. When an Order
> in writing in respect of both  81 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
> No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, these
> things is passed, it can be said that there is a complete Order of
> assessment. These two steps may be taken simultaneously or separately, but
> it cannot be gainsaid that both of them will have to be taken within the
> time prescribed by the Act. Admittedly, in this case the second step was not
> taken within the prescribed time. After determining the total income, the
> Income-tax Officer possibly left the matter to his subordinates for the
> purpose of calculating the tax payable by the assessee on the basis of the
> assessed total income. Even if we assume in favour of the Assessing Officer
> that he approved the said calculation when the papers were put before him
> for signing the demand notice, and that he signed the same, the fact remains
> that that step was taken by him after the prescribed period was over. The
> Tribunal was, therefore, right in holding that the assessment in this
> respect was time-barred." [Emphasis supplied]
31\. In view of this, he vehemently submitted that the claim of Revenue that
accounts of the assessee are incorrect and incomplete is grossly incorrect. He
therefore, stated that order cannot be passed u/s 144 of the Act but only can
be passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. He therefore, submitted that final order is
also wrongly titled as passed u/s 144 of the Act but in fact, it should have
been passed u/s 143(3) of the Act. He therefore submitted that merely wrong
mention of the section in the heading of the order is not relevant. He
submitted vehemently that appeal of the assessee is maintainable under the
provision of section 253(1)(d) of the Act.
32\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the orders
of the ld Assessing Officer i.e. draft assessment order as well as the final
order passed u/s 144 of the Act and the direction issued by the ld Dispute
Resolution Panel. The simple issue involved in this contest is that whether
the order passed by the ld Assessing Officer can be challenged by the assessee
before the coordinate bench or not. Admittedly, the assessee has preferred
reference to Dispute Resolution Panel u/s 144C of the Income Tax Act. The
provisions of section 144C relates to reference to Dispute Resolution Panel.
According to that section the ld Assessing Officer shall first forward a draft
of the proposed order of assessment to the eligible assessee which is defined
u/s 144C(15)(b) of the Act. In the present case, there is no dispute that the
assessee is an eligible assessee in terms of that section. The draft
assessment order is required to be passed if the Assessing Officer proposes to
82 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, make any variation in the income or
loss returned which are prejudicial to the interest of the eligible assessee,
Within 30 day of receipt of the draft order the assessee is entitled to filed
his acceptance of the variation to the AO or objection to such variation
before the ld DRP. If the assessee accepts the variation or ld DRP does not
receive such objection on the draft assessment order within 30 days of receipt
of draft assessment order, the AO shall complete the assessment on the basis
of draft order within one month from the end of the month in which the
acceptance is received or period of filing of objection expires. The ld DRP on
the objection shall issue the direction after considering the draft order,
objections of the assessee, evidences furnished by the assessee, report of
authorities, records of the draft order, evidence collected, and result of
enquires made. The ld DRP is further empowered to make or cause further
enquiry. Consequently, it may confirm, reduce, or enhance the variation
proposed in the draft order but it has no power to set aside any proposed
variation. Every direction issued by the ld DRP are binding to the Assessing
Officer subject to the provisions of right of appeal to the Assessing Officer
for some intermittent period before the tribunal. On receipt of the direction
of the ld DRP , AO shall complete the assessment within 1 month from the end
of the month of receipt of the direction without granting any further
opportunity of hearing to the assessee. On above analysis of the provision of
section 144C it is apparent that draft order is not required to be passed
either u/s 143(3) of the Act or u/s 144 of the Act. in the present case the
draft assessment order forwarded by the ld Assessing Officer to the assessee
vide letter dated 31.03.2013 bearing reference No. FNO.DCIT/
Cir-13(1)/2013-14/1827 mentioning that copy of the draft assessment order u/s
143(3) of the Income Tax Act read with section 144C of the Act is forwarded.
In the subject bearing also the ld AO has mentioned that draft assessment
order is u/s 143(3) of the Act. It is also an undisputed fact that draft
assessment order of the ld Assessing Officer passed on 31.03.2013 also
mentions in the heading at Sl. No. 11 section and sub-section under which the
assessment is as section 143(3) read with section 144C of the Income Tax Act,
1961. It is also undisputed fact that ld Assessing Officer has mentioned in
the heading also "draft order u/s 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act."
However such mentioning of the wrong section in the draft of the proposed
assessment order cannot render it as  83 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
"Draft assessment order u/s 143(3) of the act" when there is no such provision
in the statue. It is a settled proposition of law that mere mention of wrong
provision of the law when the power exercise is available even though under
the different provision is by itself not sufficient to invalidated the
exercise of that power. The Hon'ble High Court has laid down the above
principal in Collector of Central Excise Vs. Pradumna Steel Ltd (2003) 9 SCC
234. The above proposition has been reiterated in following subsequent
decisions in Mehboob Vs. Zahira and others 2015 (110) ALR 437, Jagnnath Vs.
State of UP and others 2011 (6) ADJ 89, Mehendra yadav Vs. Om Prakash and
another 2006 (65) ALR 560, Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Kay Kay Faimly Trust
(2005) 278 ITR 620 (Alld), Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Asha Family Trust
(2005) 148 Taxman 578(all), Eric John Singh Vs. The District magistrate and
others 1989 AWC 210 (all), Ram Chandra Misra Vs. State of UP 1982 (8) ACR 419
(all) and Govind Dass and others Vs. Prescribed Authority etc and another 1978
(4) ALR 753. In view of this we reject the contention of the ld AR that as the
Assessing Officer has mentioned reference to Section 143(3) while making draft
assessment order, so the draft order is not u/s 144 of the act but u/s 143(3)
of the act. Even the provisions of section 144C does not provide that draft
assessment order is required to be passed u/s 143(3) or u/s 144 of the Act.
According to us the draft assessment order is required to be passed u/s
144C(1) of the Act. it is further to be noted that it is not the „draft order‟
but it is draft of the proposed order of assessment. Therefore, there is no
requirement of mentioning any sections by the Assessing Officer except 144C(1)
in the draft of the proposed order of assessment. It is further required to be
noted that the draft of the proposed order of assessment is altogether
different from the assessment order as such draft does not include the notice
of demand but also does not have any enforceability of tax dues from the
assessee where as the assessment order has such ingredients and it is
accompanies with notice of demand u/s 156 of the act. According to us the
draft of the proposed assessment order is just like a statement of facts and
reasons formed by the assessing officer during the assessment proceedings
about the proposed additions etc for which assessee has right to go to higher
forum of three commissioners to show that proposed variation by the ld AO is
incorrect. It is an internal dispute resolution mechanism of revenue so that
unnecessary disputes  84 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, between
assessee and revenue do not arise. Further each and every observation and
variation in the income or loss return, which is prejudicial to the interest
of the assessee, is subject to objection against it by the assessee before the
DRP. Even assessee in the present case has challenged the application section
145 (3) of the act before the ld DRP which did not result in to any variation
to the income but may lead to such adjustment. Similarly assumption of
jurisdiction u/s 144 by the AO may also lead to the variation of income.
Therefore the contention of the ld AR is not digestible that such assumption
of jurisdiction u/s 144 cannot be challenged before DRP.
33\. It is important to note that the final assessment order passed by the ld
Assessing Officer has been made u/s 144 of the Act is the argument of the
Revenue whereas, the contention of the assessee is that order is passed u/s
143(3) of the Act. Therefore, it is necessary to look into why and how the
Assessing Officer has passed order u/s 144 of the Act and whether the
contention of the assessee is correct or not. Therefore , It is necessary to
go to the draft assessment order for the relevant reasons /observation of the
ld Assessing Officer. At page NO. 45 of 51 of the draft assessment order in
para NO. 6 the ld AO has dealt with this issue as under:-
"6. Unexplained Money Pursuant to receipt of information from various sources
including Hon'ble Members of Parliament and Ld. Members of Bar, it came to the
notice of the undersigned that the assessee company was issued summons u/s 131
of the IT Act, 1961 by ADIT(Inv.) Unit-II(2), New Delhi on 27.12.2010 to
furnish as under:-
(1) List of the subsidiaries of New Delhi Television Ltd. and their
subsidiaries along with details of their directors and books of accounts since
01.04.2006. (2) Details of shareholders and investors of these subsidiaries
with their names and complete address since 01.04.2006 and brief note on
nature of activities carried by each subsidiary.
(3) Details of loan given and taken fund raised and investment made by M/s New
Delhi Television Ltd. and its subsidiaries after 01.04.2006. In regard to  85
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.

sanction/intimation given/made to/by the relevant regulatory authority i.e.
RBI, FIPB(furnish a copy of it). (4) Details of shares sold and purchased by
M/s New Delhi Television Ltd. and its subsidiaries alongwith their amount
since 01.04.2006 with documentary evidence.
(5) PAN and IT Returns of these subsidiaries since 01.04.2006.
The assessee was directed to attend the office of the ADIT(Inv.) along with
the above called for information on 31.12.2010. On that date no information
was provided by the assessee and on behalf of M/s RRPR Holding Pvt. Ltd. a
request was made for adjournment which was allowed and case was adjourned for
17.01.2011. Similar request was made by the assessee company and case was
adjourned for 17.01.2011. However, on the next date also no information was
provided by the assessee.
It is seen that the assessee company is having at least 21 subsidiaries as
recorded by Ministry of Corporate Affairs OM No. 47/469/2009-CLIII dated
03.07.2009. However the documents as prescribed under section 212 of the
Indian companies Act, 1956 were not attached nor any recital in terms of sub-
section 6 of section 212 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 was made in the
Balance Sheet and Audited Accounts that was finalized and signed by the Board
of Directors of the assessee company on 30.04.2009 and also certified by the
auditors of the assessee company namely the Price Waterhouse . Thus it is
clear that the accounts of the assessee stood closed and finalized as on
30.04.2009 for the year ended on 31.03.2009.
It is further seen that the accounts of the assessee were not made and
submitted alongwith the Return of Income for the year ended 31.03.2009 as per
the Indian Accounting Standard 1 as issued by the Central Government in so
much as the necessary disclosures in terms of para 19 and para 20 were not
made and it was not possible to have if fair and reasonable  86 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessment about the financial activities of
the assessee company, more so its activities through its subsidiaries both in
India and abroad.
Similarly, it was found that the necessary disclosures in terms of Indian
Accounting Standard-24 as issued by the Central Government were also not
complied with. The requirements of Indian Accounting Standard-7, 12, 18, 19,
27, 28, 33 and 107 as issued by the Central Government were also found not to
be complied with.
The undersigned was in receipt of various complaints against the assessee
alleging large scale money laundering and resultant evasion of tax which could
not be verified because of non- compliance of the Indian Accounting Standard
as issued by the Central Government referred to hereinabove by the assessee,
the assessee was asked under the provisions of section 142(1) to furnish the
necessary details pursuant to which the assessee filed a letter dated
27.02.2013 and enclosed some of the details asked for. However, the details
related to M/s NDTV Network Plc was not enclosed though it was stated in the
letter to have been enclosed and provided.
As the material information which was required under the law to be attached
with the balance sheet of the assessee company was neither attached nor being
provided pursuant to summons issued by the Department in December 2010 nor in
response to notice issued in February 2013, a reasonable belief was formed
that the accounts of the assessee are not maintained and prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Standards issued by the Central Government and
were therefore incomplete and incorrect based upon which the true and correct
income of the assessee liable to tax cannot be determined.
In view of the above situation, a show cause notice was issued to the assessee
under section 145(3) of IT Act, 1961 r.w. Provisions of Sections 209,210,211
and 212 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 asking the assessee  87 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, to explain why the books of accounts of the
assessee not in accordance with the provisions of section 145(3) of the IT
Act, 1956 be rejected and assessment of the assessee company is completed in
accordance with the provisions of section 144 of the IT Act, 1961. The said
notice was served upon the assessee by fax on 29.03.2013 and in view of the
scheduled limitation on 31.03.2013 assessee was requested to submit its reply
by 30.03.2013.
The reply of the assessee was duly received on 30.03.2013 whereby it was
stated by the assessee that the assessee company was exempted to attach the
details of subsidiaries with its balance sheet and other accounts in terms of
the provisions of sub-section 8 of section 212 of the Indian Companies Act,
1956 and for the first time a copy of the said permission granted by Central
Government was furnished.
The order of Ministry of Corporate Affairs dated 03.07.2009 was a conditional
order and therefore the same was required to be disclosed in the accounts of
the assessee and a recital was required to be made by the assessee in its
accounts to the effect of the said order. However, no such disclosure was made
nor the conditions specified therein were complied with which said that the
consolidated financial statement will be made in strict compliance with the
accounting standard and listing agreement as prescribed by SEBI. As there was
no disclosure or a recital about the order dated 03.07.2009 of the Central
Government, it was not possible either for the undersigned or any other person
or authority to know about the exact affairs of the assessee which was
required to be known to determined its true and correct income liable to tax.
In any case the accounts of the assessee for the year ending 31.03.2009 i.e.
the P Y 2008-09 relevant for AY 2009-10 was finalized, approved on April 30,
2009 while the order of the Central Government being relied upon by the
assessee was issued only on 03.07.2009 which is not issued with  88 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, retrospective effect and which does not condone
or regularize the lapses or omissions of the earlier period.
On 30.04.2009 when the accounts of the assessee was finalized and approve by
the Board of Directors of the assessee, there was no exemption available to
the assessee not to comply with the requirements of sub-section 1 of section
212 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956. And therefore the accounts of the
assessee were required to be prepared and finalized disclosing all the details
prescribed under section 212(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The same
not having been done, the requirements of section 145(3) of the I T Act, 1961
are not complied with in so much as the accounts of the assessee were in
accordance with the accounting standards prescribed by the Central Government
as detailed hereinabove and therefore were neither correct nor complete.
The OM dated 03.07.2009 being relied upon by the assessee is of no help as it
could not have been relied upon by the assessee prior to its issuance which
was on or after 03.07.2009. As Central Government did not made the said OM
effective retrospectively, the omission of the assessee in so much as not
attaching the accounts of the subsidiaries and other prescribed reports with
its annual accounts that were finalized on 30.04.2009 renders the accounts of
the assessee to be incomplete and incorrect and contrary to the Indian
Accounting Standards-1, 7,12, 18, 19, 24, 27, 28, 33 and 107 as issued by the
Central Government from time to time and being in vogue during the relevant
accounting period and when the accounts of the assessee were finalized and
approved by the Board of Directors of the assessee company i.e. on 30.04.2009.
Vide its letter dated 30.03.2013 the assessee vide para 8 contended that
section 145(3) of the Act, talks about correctness or completeness of the
accounts of the assessee only and not of its subsidiary or affiliates and
therefore the provisions of section 145(3) were claimed to be applicable only
89 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, in cases where the accounts of the
assessee on stand alone were not complete and correct.
The contentions of the assessee is not maintainable as the provisions of
section 212(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 prescribed that accounts of
the subsidiaries as well as reports prescribed therein are to be attached with
accounts of the holding company and in the instant case the assessee being the
holding company, it was mandatory to attached the documents in respect of its
subsidiaries as prescribed in section 212(1) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956
and the same not having been done by the assessee, the accounts as prepared
and attached by the assessee with its return of income was neither complete
nor correct. The same was also in contravention and contrary to the accounting
standards as issued by the Central Government.
The OM dated 03.07.2009 was available to the assessee on or after 03.07.2009
only and not before that and therefore the accounts as prepared finalized and
approved by the Board of Directors of the company on 30.04.2009 had to be in
compliance of the provisions of section 212(1) of the Indian Companies Act,
1956 which has not been done. Further the said OM prescribed that accounts
were to be prepared in accordance with the accounting standards and the Indian
Accounting Standard 24 as issued by the Central Government prescribed for full
and complete disclosure of the related party information which was not done by
the assessee.
The Income Tax Act, 1961 is a self-contained code and is not subordinated to
the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The assessee was required to fulfill and
comply with the requirements of the IT Act, 1961 independent of the
requirements of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 .
In view of the breach of the conditions prescribed 145(3) of the IT Act, 1961
undersigned is not satisfied about the correctness and the completeness of the
accounts of the assessee and is of the considered view  90 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, that the accounts of the assessee as notified
by the Central Government has not been properly and completely followed by the
assessee.
In view of the same as stated hereinabove, the undersigned holds and declares
that the provisions of section 145(3) of the IT Act, 1961 is applicable to the
case of the assessee for the assessment year 2009-10 in respect of previous
year 2008-09 and undersigned thereby and therefore assumes jurisdiction under
section 144 of the IT Act, 1961 to determine the true and correct income of
the assessee company.
From the details submitted by the assessee on 30.03.2013, it is seen that the
assessee company alongwith four of its subsidiaries has receipt on through an
agreement dated 23.05.2008 has received an amount of Rs. 6,42,54,22,000/-
equivalent to US $ 150 Million in lieu of some indirect stake by the claimed
lender of the money but has not discharged its primary onus in terms of
section 68, 69A and other applicable provisions. Vide para 2 of the letter
dated 30.03.2013 of the assessee, it was admitted that no independent
valuation for determining the value of the shares of the subsidiaries of the
assessee was carried out or obtained by the assessee. The subscription price
was a negotiated price arrived between the parties based on proposed business
potential and business forecast and projections.
From the above it is more than clear that the money received by the assessee
through its subsidiaries was not as per the fair value of the shares proposed
to be transferred and the requirements of Indian Accounting Standard 18 as
also elsewhere which defines the fair value ―the amount for which an asset
could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing
parties in an arm's length transaction‖ has not been complied with and the
said transaction is merely colorable exercise to cover up the trail of money.
―  91 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, In view of the above, it is held that
assessee has failed to discharged its primary onus cast upon it and therefore
the entire amount received by the assessee through its subsidiaries and
through an agreement dated 23.05.2008 to which assessee is equally a party is
covered by the provisions of section 69A of the IT Act, 1961 .
The said amount of Rs. 6,42,54,22,000/- was received by M/s NDTV Networks
International Holdings BV ( a subsidiary of the assessee company) on account
of subscription to its shares by M/s Universal Studios International BV. As
per requirements of law and accounting standards discussed above, the said sum
should have been disclosed by the assessee. Whereas, the assessee has not
disclosed the true nature of transactions in its books of accounts / financial
statements . Moreover, it was only on 30/3/2013 i.e at the fag end of the
limitation period that the assessee stated that this amount was received by
its subsidiary company on account of subscription to shares by a foreign
company. It was done deliberately by the assessee so as to avoid further
scrutiny regarding the identity and creditworthiness of the share subscriber
and genuineness of the transactions.
The genuineness of this transaction shown as receipt of share capital becomes
all the more doubtful in view of the fact the assessee has itself admitted
that no independent valuation report was obtained for determining the value of
shares of its subsidiary company and that the subscription price was a
negotiated price arrived at between the parties . Subscription to the shares
of the subsidiary company of the assessee without determining any valuation
for the same and receiving such funds by a foreign party raises suspicion
regarding the true nature of the transactions. It is a well settled law that
it is the onus of the assessee to prove the identity and creditworthiness of
the share subscribers and genuineness of the transactions. Whereas in the
instant case, the assessee could not discharge the onus cast upon it to
satisfactorily prove the nature and source of the funds received by it.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, In view of the above, the assessee is found
to be the owner of the unexplained money for which it could not furnish any
satisfactory explanation. Therefore, the above said sum of Rs.
6,42,54,22,000/- is hereby held to be the income of the assessee from
undisclosed sources and the same is hereby added to the income of the
assessee.‖
34\. On reading of the above observation of the ld Assessing Officer it is
apparent that assessee company was having 21 subsidiaries, however, prescribed
particulars u/s 212 of the Companies Act 1956 of those companies were not
attached with the balance sheet of the a company. It is further observed by
the AO that accounts of the assessee were not complied by making necessary
disclosure in terms of accounting standard 24, 7, 12, 18, 19, 27, 28 and 33.
According to the Assessing Officer it was material information, which was
required under the law to be attached with the balance sheet of the assessee,
was not at all attached and therefore the accounts of the assessee are not
complete and correct. Notices were also issued to be assessee in February 2013
for compliance for submitting the balance sheet of its subsidiary companies.
Therefore the AO was of the view that accounts of the assessee were incomplete
and incorrect. Hence, he invoked the provisions of section 145(3) of the Act
due to non-compliance of provision of section 209, 210, 211 and 212 of the
Indian Companies Act, 1956. As the ld Assessing Officer has invoked the
provisions of section 145(3) of the Act as he is not satisfied about the
correctness and completeness of the accounts of the assessee, he is required
to make the assessment in the manner provided u/s 144 of the act. Before the
ld AO it was also contended by the assessee that non submission of the
requisite details of subsidiary or its affiliate companies has nothing to do
with the " Correctness and completeness of the accounts of the assessee and
therefore, the invocation of section 145(3) is incorrect. To examine this
aspect it is necessary to examine the provision of section 145(3) of the Act
which are as under:-
> ―145(3) Where the Assessing Officer is not satisfied about the correctness
> or completeness of the accounts of the assessee, or where the method of
> accounting provided in sub-section (1) has not been regularly followed by
> the  93 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
> 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessee, or income has not
> been computed in accordance with the standards notified under sub-section
> (2) the Assessing Officer may make an assessment in the manner provided in
> section 144.‖
35\. Therefore the statue has given a mandate to the assessing officer to pass
the order in manner provided u/s 144 of the act when requirement of section
145(3) is satisfied.
36\. Further with respect to the argument of the ld AR that while making an
assessment of the assessee the ld AO should look only at the provision of
Income tax act and should not be concerned about the violation or
irregularities in the other laws, we are not impressed in the facts of the
present case. It is the case of the company, which is statutorily required to
maintain its books of accounts and to prepare its profit and loss account in
the manner so provided in the Companies act. The Companies act provides that
bal lance sheet and profit and loss should be true and fair and must
necessarily disclose certain details. The Income tax Act also prescribes in
case of companies to prepare the annul accounts as per the provision of the
companies act 1956 . How important it is that can be ascertained by looking at
the provision of section 115 JB of the act. Therefore it is too naïve to say
that ld AO must shut his eyes in the case of the company if it does not
prepare its annual accounts in accordance with the provision of the companies
act. Wherever there is such requirement , the legislation on its own wisdom
has given different treatment/ concessions to such companies such as
electricity companies , NBFC , bank etc. The various authorities relied up on
by the ld AR also does not say so. Therefore, in case of the companies it is
mandatory to prepare their accounts in accordance with the provision of the
companies act unless exempted.
37\. The provision of section 212 of Companies Act 1956 provides with respect
to the disclosure of the particulars of the subsidiary are as under:-
> "212. (1) There shall be attached to the balance sheet of a holding company
> having a subsidiary or subsidiaries at the end of the financial year as at

year ends by more than six months.
(d) Where the financial year of a subsidiary is shorter in duration than that
of its holding company, references to the financial year of the subsidiary in
clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall be construed as references to two or more
financial years of the subsidiary the duration of which, in the aggregate, is
not less than the duration of the holding company s financial year.

(4) Clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (3) shall apply only to profits and

other purpose) be treated as aforesaid so far as they are profits or losses
for the period before the date on or as from which the shares were acquired by
the company or any of its subsidiaries, except that they may in a proper case
be so treated where
(a) the company is itself the subsidiary of another body corporate; and
(b) the shares were acquired from that body corporate or a subsidiary of it;
and for the purpose of determining whether any profits or losses are to be
treated as profits or losses for the said period, the profit or loss for any
financial year of the subsidiary may, if it is not practicable to apportion it
with  96 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:

(5) Where the financial year or years of a subsidiary referred to in sub-
section (2) do not coincide with the financial year of the holding company, a
statement containing information on the following matters shall also be
attached to the balance sheet of the holding company :

balance sheet of the holding company.
(7) The documents referred to in clauses (e), (f) and (g) of sub-section (1)
shall be signed by the persons by whom the balance sheet of the holding

56a (8) The Central Government may, on the application or with the consent of
the Board of directors of the company, direct that in relation to any
subsidiary,  97 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the provisions of this
section shall not apply, or shall apply only to such extent as may be
specified in the direction.
(9) If any such person as is referred to in sub-section (6) of section 209
fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with the provisions of this
section, he shall, in respect of each offence, be punishable with imprisonment
for a term  57 which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend
to [ten] thousand rupees, or with both :
Provided that in any proceedings against a person in respect of an offence  58
under this section, it shall be a defence to prove [***] that a competent and

that the provisions of this section are complied with, makes default in doing

a term  57 which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to
[ten] thousand rupees, or with both:
Provided that no person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for any such
offence unless it was committed wilfully.‖
38\. On reading of the above provision, it is apparent that the balance sheet
of the holding company i.e. the assessee, must have details of the subsidiary
as prescribed. The requirement of reconciling the financial year of the
subsidiary and holding company is also mandatory, further the profit and loss
account, report of the board of directors, and of auditors of those
subsidiaries are required to be prepared  98 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, according to the provisions of the companies Act, 1956. It is
also mandatory in case of foreign subsidiaries. Further, a statement is
required to be prepared of the holding company‟s interest in the subsidiary,
as well as other details shall be signed by the person by whom the balance
sheet of the company is required to be signed. The provision of sub-section 9
also prescribe a punishment with imprisonment up to 6 months along with the
fine or with the fine only for non-compliance of this section. In view of this
the importance of compliance with this provision of the companies act cannot
be undermined. Admittedly no such disclosure was made in the annual report of
the assessee.
39\. Further according to the provision of section 211 every balance sheet of
a company should be in a prescribed format containing the requisite details.
The profit and loss account of the company shall also give a true and fair
view of the profits of the company. Every profit and loss account and balance
sheet of the company shall comply with the accounting standards and if it does
not comply then it shall disclose the deviation from the accounting standards
and the reasons of such deviation. In view of the above provisions the
argument of the assessee that non-disclosure of the details of the subsidiary
in the annual accounts does not make them incomplete and incorrect. Admittedly
no such compliance was made by the assessee.
40\. Further, it is surprising to note that assessee has contended that it has
been granted exemption for making such disclosure as required u/s 212 of the
companies Act. To show this it was pointed out before us the relevant annual
accounts of the company for the year ended on 31.03.2009 wherein in the
Director‟s report placed at page No. 1757 to 1761 at page No. 13 of the
financial statement signed on 30.04.2009 by one Dr. Pranoy Roy, Chairman as
under:-
> "Financial Statements of the subsidiary companies. The Ministry of Corporate

> (Extracted from the Director‟s Report dated 30.04.2009 of assessee for the

41\. Now the ld Departmental Representative has submitted before us the copy
of approval obtained by the assessee u/s 212(8) of the companies Act 1956 for
the Financial year ended on 31.03.2009 from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
To our utter surprise the approval of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was
granted to assessee only on 3.07.2009 but in the Director‟s report dated
30.04.2009 Chairman of the company Dr. Pranoy Roy has disclosed to all the
regulatory authorities such as SEBI and stock exchanges that approval has
already been granted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. In fact the
application for such approval was made only on 8th May 2009. Further, the
above exemption was also subject to the following six conditions:-
"
> I. The company will present in the annual report the consolidated financial
> statement of it is subsidiaries duly audited by the statutory auditors.
II. The consolidated financial statement will be prepared in strict compliance
with the accounting standard and listing agreement as prescribed by SEBI III.
Following information in aggregate for each subsidiary should be disclosed in
one page of the consolidated balance sheet respectively- (a) capital (b)
reserves (c) total assets (d) total liabilities (e) details of investment
(exempt in case of investment in the subsidiaries (f) turnover (g) profit
before taxation (h) provision for taxation (i) profit after taxation (j)
proposed dividend IV. The holding company shall undertake in its annual report
that annual accounts of the subsidiary companies and the related detailed
information will be made available to the holding and subsidiary companies
investors seeking  100 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, such
information at any point of time. The annual accounts of the subsidiary
companies will also be kept for inspection by any investor in its head office
and that of the subsidiary companies concerned and a note to the above effect
will be included in the annual report to the holding company. V. The holding
as well as subsidiary companies in question will regularly file such data to
the various regulatory and government authorities as may be required by them.
VI. company will give Indian rupees equivalent of the figures given in foreign
currency appearing in the accounts of the subsidiary companies along with
exchange rate as on 31.03.2009."
42\. Even the condition No. II of the above permission was also not satisfied.
The condition No. V of the above permission also clearly states that holding
company i.e. assessee as well as its subsidiaries should regularly file such
data to various authorities and govt authorities as may be required by them.
Therefore, the above approval by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has not
authorized the company to not to submit the relevant details of its subsidiary
company to the ld Assessing Officer. Therefore, non-furnishing of such
information along with the requisite details of its subsidiaries and non-
compliance with the accounting standard, which is mandatorily to be followed
by the company, has definitely rendered the accounts of the assessee as
incorrect and incomplete. Therefore, we do not find any infirmity in the order
of the ld Assessing Officer in invoking the provisions of section 145(3) of
the Income Tax Act and then proceeded in making an assessment in the manner
provided u/s 144 of the Act.
43\. It is unfortunate that before making an application for exemption the
assessee has disclosed in its one of the most important statement i.e.
Director‟s report, the company has announced that it has been granted approval
even when there was no application was made to the concerned authority and
such a blatant violation of law involving the fiscal and corporate liability
of the assessee go unnoticed so far. However, the tribunal in the present case
except expressing anguish cannot cross the limits laid down by the law. It is
for other regulatory and supervisory agencies to get alarmed with such an act.
In view of these glaring facts we do not have any  101 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, hesitation to say that the conduct of the assessee shows that
assessee had never an intention to disclose the details of its subsidiary
companies and its financial transactions to its stakeholder and to regulatory
authorities including the Income tax Authorities. Our statement also gets
fortified by our other observations in this order.
44\. The provision of section 144 of the Act prescribes four conditions under
which the ld AO can make the best judgment assessment. The provisions are as
under:-
> ―BEST JUDGMENT ASSESSMENT Section 144 If any person--
> (a) fails to make the return required under sub-section(1) of section 139
> and has not made a return or a revised return under sub-section(4) or sub-
> section(5) of that section, or
> (b) fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under sub-
> section(1) of section 142, or fails to comply with a direction issued under
> sub-section(2A) of that section, or
> (c) having made a return, fails to comply with all the terms of a notice
> issued under sub-section(2) of section 143,the Assessing Officer, after
> taking into account all relevant material which the Assessing Officer has
> gathered, shall, after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard,
> make the assessment of the total income or loss to the best of his judgment
> and determine the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such
> assessment.
> Provided thatsuch opportunity shall be given by the Assessing Officer by
> serving a notice calling upon the assessee to show cause, on a date and time
> to be specified in the notice, why the assessment should not be completed to
> the best of his judgment:
> Provided further thatit shall not be necessary to give such opportunity in a
> case where a notice under sub-section(1) of section 142 has been issued
> prior to the making of an assessment under this section."
102
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
> 45\. It is undisputed fact that the assessee was issued the notice u/s
> 142(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on several occasions but the details were
> not complied with in full. The first such notice was issued on 22.02.2011
> wherein the assessee was required to furnish the copies of balance sheet,
> profit and loss account, tax audit report etc. Naturally Annual accounts did
> not contain the information with respect to the subsidiaries of the
> assessee. The subsequent second notice was also issued on 15.02.2013 wherein
> the assessee submitted the details in part. Further, the Assessing Officer
> required the assessee to furnish the complete details about the investment
> wherein, the assessee failed to submit before the ld AO such as share
> subscription agreement along with the share certificate issued, the evidence
> in support of identity and creditworthiness of the investor and genuineness
> of the transaction as well as the bank statements of the investor and
> investee company.
This is evident from the fact that some of the documents were filed before the
ld DRP as additional evidence. The noncompliance with the notice u/s 142(1) is
evident from the Vol-II and III of the paper book submitted by the assessee
running from page No. 379 to 741 , which are the additional evidences, filed
before the ld DRP. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the assessee has
failed to comply with all the terms of the notice issued u/s 142(1) of the Act
and therefore, the AO rightly assumed powers u/s 144 of the Act.
46\. According to provisions of section 144(1)(b) if the assessee fails to
comply with the all the terms of the notice issued u/s 142(1) then the ld
Assessing Officer after taking into account all revenant material which he has
gathered make the assessment of the total income or loss of the assessee to
the best of his judgment. In the case where the notice u/s 142(1) has been
issued to the assessee prior to the making of an assessment under the section,
no further opportunity is required to be given to the assessee. As during the
course of assessment proceeding the assessee has failed to comply with all the
term of the notice issued u/s 142(1) the Assessing Officer cannot be found at
fault for invoking the provisions of section 144 of the Act. Therefore , the
ld Assessing Officer not satisfied with the completeness and correctness of
the account of the assessee is duty bound to make an assessment in the manner
provided u/s 144 of the Act and further as the assessee has failed to  103 ITA
No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, comply with all the terms of the notice u/s
142(1) the assessment is correctly proposed to be made by the AO u/s 144 of
the Act.
47\. It is also pertinent to note that despite there being a finding in the
draft assessment order of assuming the jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act it was
not challenged by the assessee before the ld DRP. However the invocation
section 145(3) was challenged. On specific query by the bench on any objection
raised by the assessee on this aspect the assessee could not point out any
such objection raised before the ld DRP. Therefore, it is apparent that
assessee was not serious about assumption of jurisdiction by the ld AO u/s 144
of the Act in the draft assessment order till the revenue challenged the
maintainability of the appeal before us. Therefore, as the AO has assumed
jurisdiction u/s 144 of the Act in the draft assessment order, which is
unchallenged before the ld DRP , then the AO does not have any option other
than to pass a final assessment order u/s 144 of the Act. Even before us the
first ground of appeal , assessee admits that the order is passed u/s 144 of
the Act.
48\. Now it is required to be seen whether such an order passed u/s 144 of the
act pursuant to the direction of the ld DRP is an appealable order before the
tribunal. According to the provisions of section 253 of the Act the assessee
aggrieved by certain specified order is entitled to file an appeal to the
appellate tribunal against such order. The such specified order are as under:-
> "(a) an order passed by a Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) before the 1st day
> of October, 1998 or, as the case may be, a Commissioner (Appeals) under
> section 154, section 250, section 271, section 271A or section 272A; or
> (b) an order passed by an Assessing Officer under clause (c) of section

> (f) an order passed by the prescribed authority under sub-clause (vi) or
> sub- clause (via) of clause (23C) of section 10.‖
49\. The orders passed according to the clause (d) are an order passed by the
AO under section 3 of section 143 or section 147 or section 153A or section
153C in pursuance to the direction of the Dispute Resolution Panel or an order
passed u/s 154 with respect to such orders are appealable. According to us the
order passed u/s 144 of the Act pursuance to the direction of the Dispute
Resolution Panel does not find place as an appealable order before the
tribunal. It is also an accepted proposition of the law that unless the right
to appeal is provided under the statute to a specified authority such
authority are not authorized to entertain such appeal.
50\. In the income tax act two appellate authorities are specified who can
entertain appeals arising from the order of the Assessing Officer. The first
is the Commissioner of Income Tax (appeals) where the appealable orders before
him are prescribed u/s 246A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. According to section
246A(1)(a) the orders passed u/s 144 are appealable. Such fact has also been
accepted by the assessee in its written note submitted which has been
incorporated above in this order wherein in para No. 21 it is admitted by the
ld AR that order passed u/s 144 of the Act are appealable before the ld
CIT(A), however, he stated that for filing an appeal the AO ought to have
determined the total assessed income and demand of tax and further issued
notice of demand u/s 156 of the Act. He further stated that no notice of
demand was issued along with the draft assessment order dated  105 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 31.03.2013. According to us the ld AR did not
appreciate that it is the final assessment order which is passed u/s 144 of
the Act in pursuance to the direction of the ld DRP is showing computation of
total income as well as the computation of demand of tax and also accompanied
by the notice u/s 156 of the Act. Therefore, such assessment order is
appealable before the ld CIT(A). However, the ld AR is referring to the draft
assessment order only and naturally u/s 144C of the Act there is no provision
of issuing notice of demand. The notice of demand u/s 156 of the Act is
required to be issued only with the final order passed in pursuance of the
direction of ld Dispute Resolution Panel, which is not demined by the
assessee. Therefore, according to us the tribunal is not right appellate forum
where assessee should have filed such an appeal where the order is passed u/s
144 read with section 144C of the Act. Hence, according to us the appeal of
the assessee is not maintainable.
51\. In view of the above findings that appeal of the assessee is not
maintainable against the order passed u/s 144 of the Act we do not take into
cognizance the grounds of appeal filed by the assessee.
52\. In the result appeal of the assessee listed as ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 for
AY 2009-10 is dismissed as non-maintainable.
ITA No. 2658/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10 ( by revenue)
53\. The first ground of appeal is with respect to the disallowance of Rs.

> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, ―The reply of the assessee has been
> considered and is not found tenable.
> The assessee has relied upon the case of CIT Vs Living Media India Ltd
> (supra), which is clearly distinguishable from the facts in the present case
> of the assessee. The same are enumerated hereunder:-
In the case of Living Media, the assessee was a publisher of magazines like
India Today, Business Today etc., and was a principal on its own. It did not
carry out directions of any other agencies and was the ultimate authority to
publish the advertisements in its own magazines.- The space sold to its
advertising agency or directly through advertiser were direct and direct only
and no intermittent party or agency was involved. To be very clear it is
Living Media India Vs Advertising agency and that is the reason why Hon'ble
Court have held that the relationship is on a principal to principal-basis.
The assessee sells the space at a price through the agency/agents. The agents,
further, in turn sell it to the advertisers. The assessee sells such time slot
to the agents. The agents book the times slot to end user i.e. advertisers.
This is done on behalf of the media (which is catering to all segments of
public). Therefore, the relationship between the assessee and the agency is
that of principal and agent and not the principal - principal as stated by the
assessee. The contention of assessee that no services are said to be rendered
by the Agency for facilitating sale particularly because it is the Agency only
which is buying space from the media i.e. the assessee is also factually
incorrect. It is true that the services of the Agency (to get advertisements)
do not facilitate sale. But the services provided by the Agency definitely get
a substantial amount of revenue in the form of advertisement to the Assessee.
In turn the Agency is paid agency commission which is ubiquitously termed as
'commission' by the assessee, in its invoice as reproduced above.
It is a well settled proposition that a contract can exist with mutual consent
or with intent, where there only has to be an offer and an acceptance which is
107 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the case in the present matter.The
modus operandi explained by the assessee was that as per 'industry practice'
15% of gross amounts received/receivable by the assessee were withheld by the
Agency as its 'commission', as shown in the invoices also. However, the
assessee has claimed that it is 'discount or trade discount, which is being
retained by the agency and net payment is being made to the assessee.
The modus operandi of the assessee becomes clearer when we examine some of the
bills/vouchers of Agencies through which the advertisements were procured. The
examination of invoice of M/s TLG India Private Limited (Agency) raised by M/s
NDTV Ltd. reveals that Invoice Cum Challan was issued to M/s TLG India Private
Limited by NDTV Ltd. (assessee) wherein the client reference / caption was Jet
Airways (I) Limited, for advertisement in the different programmes of NDTV
Ltd. Invoice of gross amount of Rs. 28,75,600/- was raised; Agency Commission
was deducted of Rs.4,31,340/- and net amount of Rs.24,44,260/- + service tax,
education cess and secondary cess, was shown to be receivable from the client
through the Agency i.e. M/s TLG India Private Limited (Agency). The details
have already been reproduced in para above.
It is clear from the above invoice that the transaction is between assessee
and the ultimate client i.e. owner of Jet Airways (I) Limited through the
Agency i.e. TLG India Private Limited. The payment of gross amount' is
remitted by the ultimate client to the Agency, which, after deducting its 15%
commission, remits the net amount to assessee. In any case, the Agency is only
acting in the capacity of facilitator and providing services both to the
advertiser and as well as assessee. For these services, the Agency is being
remunerated at the specified rates i.e. 15% commission as mentioned in the
invoices. It is immaterial as to whether assessee makes payment to Agency as
Commission for services rendered or the Agency first withholds its due and
then remits the balance to assessee. The undeniable fact remains that the said
amount of 15% of gross amount is in effect a charge on the assessee  108 ITA
No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, and this fact cannot change simply because of
the financial arrangement between assessee and Agent as per their convenience,
further even the assesse has mentioned the said amount ascommission in its
invoices.
In fact, if the entire transaction is seen, then, at one end of the spectrum
is the controlling organization of the publications channels and at the other
end is the client/advertiser who pays for the advertisement. All persons
operating in between are actually performing services on behalf of both.
However, by no stretch of imagination can the Agency be described as a
'principal' because, as clear from the invoice (supra) it books advertisements
by order on behalf of the clients receives payment, as clear from the invoice
and remits the amount to NDTV Ltd. after deducting its commission. The invoice
of TLG India Private ltd.raised clearly categorizes the amount as
'Commission'. The payment on account of 'Commission' flows directly from the
nature of services rendered by the Agency and does not depend on case to case
basis as rates are fixed. Since, the said amount withheld by Agency actually
constitutes expenditure in the form of 'Commission' the assessee was obliged
to deduct tax at prescribed rates, more so because the Agency does not pay
from its own pocket but only remits amounts received from client to the
assessee.
The relationship between TLG India Private Limited (Agent) and that of
assessee is nothing but principal to agent because the ultimate principal is
the client who makes the payment to the advertiser i.e. assessee though the
agent. Hence the deduction of TDS on the gross amount of commission is
squarely applicable in the hands of assessee. Since it is not possible for the
Individual media company to procure advertisements regularly on its own it
utilizes the facilities/services of various Agents/Agencies who procure
advertisements on their behalf for telecast in the channels owned by the
assessee.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, It has been explained that the amounts
remitted are after deducting @ 15% of gross amount received by Agency. Thus it
is clear that for these services, Agencies are remunerated @ 15% of gross
amount as is clear from the billing, the only difference1 is that instead of
reflecting a gross amount in its books (e.g. Rs. 28,75,600/- in the sample
voucher of TLG India Private Limited, then deducting commission of
Rs.4,31,340/- @ 15% of gross amount of Rs. 28,75,600/- the assessee is
directly booking net amount of Rs. 24,44,260/- in its books of accounts.
However, this is'only a financial arrangement arrived at between assessee and
the agent and it cannot be denied that expense has been incurred by the
assessee, the only difference being that it is not in the form of direct
payment to Agent, but rather in indirect form e. the Agent withholds amounts
due to it and remits the balance to the assessee. This in no way takes away
from the expenditure incurred by the assessee as the remuneration in the form
of commission/discount received by the agent flows from the payments received
by it.
From the above discussion it is amply clear that the assessee was fastened
with expenses of commission which instead of being borne by it by way of
actual payment has been withheld by the Agency before remitting net amount to
the assessee and can be termed as Constructive receipt in the hands of the
Agency in the form of 'Agency Commission', the nomenclature that is used in
assessee's own vouchers (supra) and as a constructive payment in the hands of
the assessee.
As is clear, assessee is trying to term the said expense as trade discount. In
this context, it is stated that in order that any rebate in price is termed as
Discount, it is necessary that the dealings between two transacting parties
are on principal to principal basis. The assessee company, which sells time
slot for advertisement has paid to several business parties who work as
'agents' for booking Advertisement from certain other parties (3 rd parties.).
In this process, the Advertising Agencies (Agents) are receiving commission
from the assessee company for the services rendered by hem by way of booking

M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Advertisements from the
advertisers/public for the assessee. By no stretch of imagination, can this
amount received be called as 'Discount' as it is consideration for the
services rendered to the 3 rd parties. This is amply clear even from the
nomenclature as appearing in the assessee's vouchers.
From a plain reading of Section 194H of the IT Act, it is evident that the
commission and brokerage as per Section 194H fall within the purview of
inclusive definition per section 194H and work of agency is squarely covered
in it irrespective of the nomenclature. The discount as claimed by the
assessee is nothing but commission and is very much within the ambit of
section 194H of the IT Act.
Section 194H reads as follows:
'Any person, not being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, who is
responsible for paying, on or after the 1st day of June, 2001, to a resident,
any income by way of commission (not being insurance commission referred to in
section 194D) or brokerage, shall, at the time of credit of such income to the
account of the payee or at the time of payment of such income in cash or by
the issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier,
deduct income-tax thereon at the rate of five percent.
Provided that no deduction shall be made under this section in a case where
the amount of such income or. as the case may be, the aggregate of the amounts
of such income credited or paid or likely to be credited or paid during the
financial year to the account of. or to, the payee .does not exceed two
thousand five hundred rupees.
Provided further that an individual or a Hindu undivided family, whose total
sales, gross receipts or turnover from the business or profession carried on
by him exceed the monetary limits under clause (a) or clause (b) of section
111 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 44AB during the financial year
immediately preceding the financial year in which such commission or brokerage
is credited or paid, shall be liable to deduct income-tax under this section.
Explanation - For the purpose of this section,-
(i) "Commission or brokerage" includes any payment received or receivable,
directly or indirectly, by a person acting on behalf of another person for
services rendered (not being professional services)or for any services in the
course of buying or selling of goods or in relation to any transaction
relating to any asset, valuable article or thing, not being securities:
(it) The expression "professional services" means services rendered by a
person in the course of carrying on a legal, medical, engineering or
architectural profession or the profession or the profession of accountancy or
technical consultancy or interior decoration or such other profession as is
notified by the Board for the purpose of section 44AA;
(iii) The expression "securities" shall have the. meaning assigned to it in
clause (h) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts (regulation) Act, 1956 (42
of 1956);
(iv) Where any income is credited to any account, whether called "Suspense
account" or by any other name, in the books of account of the person liable to
pay such income, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such income to
the account of the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply
accordingly.' In support of Revenue's contention that the relationship between
the assesse company and its agents is that of principal and agent, reliance is
placed on CBDT Circular No 619 dated 4.12.1991. Relevant portion is reproduced
hereunder :-

3xxx 4xxx 5xxx A question may arise whether there would be deduction of tax at
source under section 194H where commission or brokerage is retained by the
consignee/agent and not remitted to the consignor/principal while remitting
the sale consideration. It may be clarified that since the retention of
commission by the consignee/agent amounts to constructive payment of the same
to him by the consignor/principal, deduction of tax at source is requested to
be made from the amount of commission. Therefore, the consignor/principal will
have to deposit the tax deductible on the amount of commission income to the
credit of the Central Government, within the prescribed time, as explained in
the succeeding paragraphs.' A plain reading of CBDT Circular 619 clearly
establishes the fact that in the cases where commission or brokerage is
retained by the consignee/agent and not remitted to the consignor/principal
while remitting the sale consideration, deduction of tax at source u/s 194H is
clearly applicable. It has been further clarified in the said CBDT Circular
that since the retention of commission by the consignee/agent amounts to
constructive payment of the same to him by the consignor/principal, deduction
of tax at source is required to be made from the amount of commission. Thus,
the assessee was obliged to deduct tax at source the payment to agents or
amount withheld by agents.

Nos. 27 and 62 of 2009 has, vide its order dated 20.11.2009 discussed a
similar issue at length and has held as under :-
"Section 194h of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 - Deduction of tax at source
Commission or brokerage etc. Assessee was a fully owned Government of India
undertaking engaged in telecast of news, various sports, entertainment, cinema
and other programmes- Advertisement income was its major source of revenue
Agents appointed by it canvassed advertisement on its behalf and advertisement
charges recovered from customers were in accordance with tariff prescribed by

charges remitted by advertising agencies- Whether  114 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &

Ltd, Vs.ACIT, commission paid by assessee would be subject to tax deduction at
source under section 194H\- Held, yes.
The Hon'ble Court also held that Advertisement charges collected by agents are
for respondent and agents are allowed to retain 15 per cent of the commission
by the respondent only to avoid the hassle of deposit of full amount and
repayment of 15 percent thereof towards commission. Since permission given to
agents is to withhold 15 per cent out of advertisement is nothing but a
payment made to agents in advance by Doordarshan before remittance of net
advertising charges to them by the agents. We are therefore of the view that
permission granted by Doordarshan under the agreement to the agencies to
retain 15 per cent of the commission amount to payment of commission by them
to agents which is subject to deduction of tax at source under section 194H of
the Act. It is clear from section 194H that payment includes credit of such
sum to the account of the payee or at the time of payment of such income in
cash or by the issue of cheque or draft or by any other mode. When the
respondent receives 85 percent of the advertising charges from the advertising
agency concerned.Doordarshan account full amount as received from the customer
for whom advertisement was undertaken, crediting 85 per cent received in their
account and simultaneously crediting 15 per cent in the account of the
advertising agency. Irrespective of the pattern of account maintained by the
respondent, what happens when the agent pay85 per cent of the advertisement
charges collected from the customer is that the agent simultaneously gets paid
commission of 15 per cent which he is free to appropriate as his income. TDS
on the commission charges of 15 per has to be paid by the respondent to the
income tax department with reference to the date on which 85 per cent of the
advertisement charges are received from the agent. In fact, it is only to
comply with the provision, clause 2(e) extracted above is incorporated in the
agreement wherein it is stated that agent will pay to the Doordarshan through
DD or cheque the TDS amount payable on the commission retained by agents which
we have already found as payment of commission by the respondent to the
agent."

Commission under Explanation (i) to Section 194H of the Act is defined in an
inclusive manner. Commission under the definition includes payment received or
receivable, directly or indirectly, by a person acting on behalf of another
person for services rendered (not being professional services) or for any
service in the course of buying or selling of goods or in relation to any
transaction relating to any asset, valuable article or thing (not being

to another person for which the person rendering service either receives or is
entitled to receive, directly or indirectly, payment from that another person
to whom the service is rendered.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Therefore, the first question that needs to
be answered is whether there is a principal-agent relationship between the
assessee-airline and the travel agent?
For this purpose it would be profitable to look to the definition of an agent
in Section 182 of the Contracts Act. Section 182 of the Contract Act reads as
follows :-
An agent is a person employed to do any act of another or to represent another
in dealings with third persons. The person for whom said act is done, or who
is so represented is called the principal.' It is clear from the definition
that an agency comes into existence where one person is vested with the
authority or capacity to create a legal relationship between person referred
to as a principal and an outside third party. Therefore, the basic and
essential requisites of an agency ordinarily would be that:
(i) The agent makes the principal answerable to third persons whereby the
principal can sue third parties directly and renders himself, that is, the
principal, liable to be sued directly by the third parties;
(ii) The person who purports to enter into a transaction on behalf of the
principal would have the power to create, modify or terminate contractual
relationship between his principal, that is, the person whom he represents,
and the third parties;
(iii) An agent, though bound by instructions given by him by the principal
does not work under the direct control and supervision of the principal. The
agent thus uses his own discretion to act on behalf of the principal subject
to the limits to his authority prescribed by the principal.
(iv) There is no necessity of a formal contract of agency, it can be implied
which could arise from the act of parties or situations in which parties are
put.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, It is also the case of Revenue the
essential ingredient of principal to agent as defined in Section 182 of
Contract Act are all present in the case of the assessee, which is enumerated
hereunder :-
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINCIPAL AND AGENT

principal.
The transactions entered into by the assesse clearly establishes the fact that
the agencies act on behalf of the assesse whereby a legal relationship is
established between the assesse and the third party (advertisers). Thus, the
agents, by entering into such a legal relationship on behalf of the principal,
118 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, that is the assesse, by issuing
receipts of advertisement material and the date on which the advertisement is
to be telecast, the agent makes the assesse liable to a legal action by the
advertisers i.e. the third party. Further relying upon to the decision of
Hon'ble High court of Delhi in the lead case of CIT Vs Singapore Airlines
(Supra), The Hon'ble Court held that ‗the word discout is normally used to
describe a deduction from the full amount or value of something, especially a
price (see Black's Law Dictionary VIIth Edition page 477) whereas a commission
is defined in Explanation (1) to Section 194H as any payment received or
receivable, directly or indirectly by an agent for services rendered acting on
behalf of the assesse, is defined in explanation (1) to section 194H as any
payment received or receivable , directly or indirectly by an agent for
services rendered acting on behalf of the assessee.
In view of the fact, relying upon the decision of Hon'ble High Court: is
concluded that the payment retained by the agent is inextricably linked to the
advertisement to be published by the assessee, it cannot but lead to a that
the payment retained by the agents is a commission within the meaning 194H of
the Act. This is especially so, as indicated above, at no point in time
obtains proprietary rights to the advertisement, it is clearly not a case of
disc case since there is no value or price paid by the assessee on which the a
deduction. The price or value is received by the assessee company through the
medium of the agent from the advertisers which is also one of the facets of
services offered by the agents. The price or value of the advertisement to be
published in the media received from the advertisers by the agents for and on
behaif of the assesse is held in trust. Thus, the money retained _by the
assessee is commission within the meaning of Section 194H of the Act and in no
stretch of imagination this can be termed as ‗trade discount'. To say that the
revenue is seeking to cast the liability on the assessee tax when there is no
evidence of income received by the agent is factually an incorrect submission.
It should be remembered that what is relevant is whether the Section 194H
casts on the assessee to deduct tax at source. Once an obligation is cast, it
is for the assessee to retrieve the necessary  119 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, information from the agent who works for the assessee and put
itself in a position to deduct tax on the actual income received by the agent
from the advertisers/third parties.
Further reliance is placed on the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in
the case of CIT vs Idea Cellular Ltd., in !TA No 145 of 2009 with ITA No 784
of 2009 dated 19.2.2010. Though the issue involved related to mobile phone -
pre paid/post paid, but there are certain facts which are common/relevant to
the case of the assessee. The issue 'whether the transaction in question
between the assessee and the agents amounted to contract of sale (thereby
constituting relationship of principal and principal) or it amounted to
contract of agency (thereby resulting in principal and agent) relationship has
been discussed in detail. The important issues culled out of the said decision
of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi are :-
(a)The expression 'commission' or 'brokerage' was not given in statutory
definition under the Act, one had to take into account the expression as
judicially defined.
(b)Two provisions which would be relevant for determining the issue and to
decide the real nature of transaction between the parties are Section 4 of the
Sale of goods Act and Section 182 of the Indian Contract Act. Section 4 of the
Sale of Goods Act defines 'sale', where discounts are dealt with. Section 182
of the Indian Contract Act, on the other hand, defines an agent, which
definition becomes important to consider as to whether the relationship
between the assessee and the agents is that of principal and agent, where
commission are dealt with.
(c) Commission is prima facie the payment made to an agent for agency work,
usuallyaccording to a sale, it may be on advalorem scale, but not necessarily
on ad valorem scale. It is the most general word that can be used to describe
the remuneration paid to an agent for an agency work other than a salary.
(d) Again, a commission is the recompense of reward of an agent, factor,
broker or bailee, when the same is calculated as a percentage on the amount of
his transaction or on the profit to the principal.
120
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(e) Commission generally denotes the compensation which an agent receives on
Sales.
(f) Commission is compensation paid to another for services rendered in the
handling of another's business or property and based proportionately upon the
amount or value thereof.
(g) The Hon'ble Court in the above cited case has given a passing remarks,
that if the principal is asked to deduct tax at source in respect of
commissions paid to their agents, it does not affect the principals. The
concerned agent can always file their income tax returns and claim the credit
for the payments already made on their behalf by theassessee. On the other
hand, such a provision serves public purpose inasmuch as viz.,such
distributors who would be otherwise liable to pay tax, but are evading the
tax, would come under the Income Tax Act. This is only a passing remarks,
which justifies the incorporation of such a provision like putting obligation
on the payer to deduct the tax at source and the view we have taken subserves
this rationale behind such a provision as well.
Applying the said ratio to the present case, it is seen that in the instant
matter too, the amount withheld by the Agent is in the nature of a recompense
that is calculated as a percentage of the amount of transaction i.e. @ 15% of
gross amount in the present case.
Further reliance is also placed in the case of ACIT VsBhartt Cellular Ltd.,
ITAT Kolkata Bench in ITA Ncs. 1678 & 1679/KoI/2005 dated 4.4.2006, whereby
the Hon'ble Tribunal held that there exists relationship of principal and
agent where the agent acts on behalf of the principal and executes and sells
the products of the principal.
The Hon'ble High Court of Calcutta in the above cited case has upheld the
order of ITAT and has further held that 'we conclude thus that there has been
indirect payment by the assessee to the franchisee of the commission and the
same is attractable under section 194H of the Act.
121
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, In the Guidance Note on Terms used in
Financial Statements published by ICAI, the expression 'Commission on sales'
includes sales payable to the consignee/third person and it should not be
deducted from the figure of turnover. Therefore, the assessee should have
recognized its revenue at gross value instead of net of commissions allowed to
agents. There are three rungs starting from the advertiser, then comes the
agent, finally is the assessee .
The assessee has also contended that disallowance of the amounts not shown in
the profit and loss or not claimed or not debited as an expenditure cannot be
eligible for disallowance u/s 40(a)(ia). In this context, the provisions of
Section 40 are elaborated hereunder :-
'Section 40 \- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 30 to 38,
the following amounts shall not be deducted in computing the income chargeable
under the head 'profits and gains of business or profession }-(a) in the case
of any assessee-
(ia) any interest, commission or brokerage, rent,on which tax is deductible at
sourceunder Chapter XVII-B and such tax has not been deducted or, after
deduction has not been paid or before the due date specified in sub section
(1) of section 139 ' The question that remains is that only when the expenses
are claimed as a deduction, only then the related amount would be disallowed
on account of non-compliance of the provisions.
From the invoice raised, as per method of accounting guidance note of ICAI,
the assessee is supposed to credit the gross amount of Rs.28,75,000/- in the
receipt side and debit Rs.4,31,340/- under the head agency commission in the
profit and loss account. The net effect would be offering income of
Rs.24,44,260/- in P&L a/c. Instead, the assessee has straight away credited
the net amount on Rs. 24,44,260/- in the receipts side. What has missed is
that the expenditure of Rs 4,31,340/- which is supposed to be routed through
122 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, profit and loss account is shadowed
and omitted to be debited in the net income but it does not mean that the said
expenses have not been incurred. The provisions of Sec 40 as discussed supra
contain the expression 'following amounts shall not be deducted in computing
the income chargeable under the head ...'. The word 'deducted' in the section
is not followed by the word in 'profit and loss account'. The intent of
Legislature is very clear that even if the gross amount is 'deducted' by any
sum, which is not shown directly in the P&L a/c, net effect will be same and
carries the same meaning as if it has been routed through profit and loss
account. Let us see this in a mathematical manner. Suppose the Gross receipt
of an assessee is say Rs 100/-, he expended a sum of Rs 20/-related to earning
of such grqss amount, and offers balance Rs 80/- as net profit in the books of
accounts. It bears only one meaning that (a) Total. Receipts from such venture
is Rs 100/- (b) Expenses involved are Rs 20 and (c) Net profit offered for
taxation is Rs 80/-. There is no second alternative left in this scenario.
What has to be seen is whether any expenditure has been 'deducted' from the
total receipts. Even if the said expenditure is not appearing in the profit
and loss account, it does not mean that the assessee has not expended any sum.
In the case of the assessee, the important question is not whether the said
expense has been routed through P&L a/c or not routed through P&L a/c. The
question is that the gross amount is 'reduced' by sums as given in the Tax
Invoice issued to agents and the net amount is offered for taxation. It does
not mean that no expenses have been claimed as expenditure. In this case
whether any expenditure is 'deducted' or not. The answer is, yes, expenditure
is 'deducted'.
Since agency commission of Rs.4,31,340/- is deducted from the gross receipts,
it will have the same meaning as if such sum is 'deducted in computing the
income chargeable under the head profits and gains of business' as per the
provisions of Section 40. Since TDS has not been deducted as provided under
Chapter XVII-B, the provisions of sub section
(a)(ia) of Section 40 of the Act are clearly attracted.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Reliance is placed in the case of CIT
VsLN.Dalmia, 207 ITR 89, and in the case of CIT VsDurgadass More 82 ITR 540
(Supreme Court), the hon'ble Apex Court has held that 'a little probing was
sufficient in the present case to show that apparent was not real. The taxing
authorities were not required to put on blinkers while looking at the
documents produced before them. They were entitled to look into surrounding
circumstances to find out the reality of recitals made in the documents.' If
Corporate veil is lifted one can see the real picture and modus operandi of
the business activities carried out by the assessee. As per reply dt.
07.03.2013, the assessee has submitted details of quantum of advertisement
revenue generated to advertising agencies, which amounts to Rs.
235,41,66,296/-, which is net of commission paid to the agencies @15%. The
assessee was asked to furnish gross amount charged during the year under
consideration but no details have been furnished by assessee. Therefore
considering the 15% commission paid by the assessee, as per assessee's letter
dated 07.03.2013, on a revenue of Rs. 235,41,66,296/- the grossed up revenue
comes to Rs.276,96,07,407/- and commission on the gross revenue @15% comes to
Rs.41,54,41,111/- which has been paid by the assessee.
In view of the facts as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs it is clear that
the transactions (on which discount as claimed by the assessee) was not paid
on principal to principal basis but was in the nature of principal- agents for
the services rendered to 3rd parties, and by no stretch of imagination can be
termed as discount and the assessee has itself in its invoices categories the
said amount as commission. Therefore, the discount (as claimed by assessee)
paid by the assessee is nothing but agency commission liable for deduction of
TDS either in section 194H or 194J or both. However, it has not deducted the
TDS at all on such amount. Therefore Rs 41,54,41,111/- is disallowed u/s
40a(ia) of the Income Tax Act., 1961 and added to the income of the assessee.
In this context, the assessee may plead that no amount of Commission has
actually been paid to the Act. However, as discussed in the preceding paras
the amounts withheld by the Agencies in the form of  124 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
& 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television

the said amounts having been netted from the receivable of the assessee
construe constructive payment or constructive debit in the accounts of the
assessee as amplified in CBDT Circular No. 619 also (discussed supra).
Accordingly, an amount of Rs. 41,54,41,111/- is disallowed and added back to
the total income of the assessee. I am satisfied that the assessee has
furnished inaccurate particulars of its income and has concealed its correct
income on this issue, therefore, penalty proceeding U/s 271(1)(c) of I, Tax

56\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and also perused the
facts of the case as well as the decision of the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court. We
are convinced with the argument of the ld AR that the issue is squarely
covered by the decision of Hon‟ble jurisdictional high court. The ld DR could
not controvert that how this issue is not squarely covered in favour of the
assessee and he also could not show us any other judicial precedent so as to
persuade us to disagree with the views of the ld DRP. Further merely because
the revenue has filed an SLP before the hon‟ble Supreme Court against the
decision of Delhi High Court cannot be a reason for sustaining the
disallowance. In view of this we do not find any infirmity in the direction of
the ld DRP in directing the ld Assessing Officer to delete the disallowance
commission paid amounting to Rs. 415441111/-. In the result the ground No. 1
of the appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
57\. The second ground of appeal is against the deletion of disallowance of
Rs.
78123855/- on account of transmission and up linking charges paid by the
assessee to Intelsat Corporation USA without deduction of tax at source.
During the course of assessment proceedings it was found by the ld AO that
assessee has made payment of transmission and up linking charges of Rs.
145251704/- and out of which a sum of Rs. 78123855/- was paid to M/s. Intelsat
Corporation USA. The ld Assessing Officer was of the view that above is deemed
income of the recipient u/s 9(1) of the Act and therefore, the assessee was
liable to deduct tax at source on such payment. Hence, he disallowed the above
sum holding as under:-
> "4. Transmission and uplinking Charges In the P & L Account the assessee had
> debited Rs.14,52,51,704/- under the head Transmission and Uplinking Charges.
> In the notes to account the assessee has furnished the details of

The assessee in its reply dt. 11.03.2013 and 22.03.2013, submitted that the
payment has been made to a foreign company and in view of the decision of  127

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Hon'ble ITAT Delhi, in DCIT vs. PanAmSat
International System Inc. 103 TTJ 861 (Del), it is not obliged to deducts TDS.
The relevant para of reply dt. 11.03.2013 and 22.03.2013 are reproduced as
under: Relpy dated 11.3.2013 (filed on 22.03.2013) We have been show-caused as
to why disallowance be not be made in respect of transmission and uplinking
charges for the non-deduction of TDS u/s 40(1)(ia) paid to Intelsat? Please
note that we have already given the details of transmission and uplinking
charges to your honour vide our submission dated 11th March'2013. We reiterate
that the provisions of TDS/withholding taxes were fully complied with. The
payments were made after obtaining the requisite certificates from the
Chartered Accountant as defined in the explanation to section 288B of the
Income Tax Act'1961. Copies of Form 15CA/CB issued by an independent chartered
accountant were also placed before you.
We respectfully submit that there should not be any disallowance on account of
non-deduction of TDS/withholding taxes from the payments made to Intelsat
Corporation, we are giving below a brief note on the same:
During the year under consideration, the assessee Company booked the expense
of Rs. 7,81,23,855/- on account of transponder services received from M/s
Intelsat Corporation (Intelsat) in terms of its agreement for the use of
satellite (transponder capacity).
Before we proceed to our specific submission and a fact of the case, we here-
in-below submits the nature of transaction entered between the assessee
Company and Intelsat Corporation to understand its taxability and application
of provisions of section 195 of the Act.
The assessee Company is engaged in the business of broadcasting, operating a
TV channel. The assessee Company video-graphs events that takes place as and
when they happen in the form of programs and by using transmission and up-
linking facilities, it sends signals to a satellite that is  128 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, hovering in space. The signals sent to the
satellite are decoded and down- linked over the area covered by the satellite.
A transponder is a part of the satellite which receives such signals from the
earth stations and re-transmits the same back to the earth with or without
amplifying them.
The assessee Company entered into an arrangement with Intelsat Corporation, a
Company incorporated in and resident of USA for using such transponder
capacity, to make the signals available to the cable operators, who in turn
beam the signals to the viewers in their homes.
The above services are like standard facility used for transmission of
programs by various media companies. The assessee Company makes use of such
facility during the year provided by the Intelsat Corporation.
The assessee Company most respectfully submits the following points for
favourable consideration on merits:
The payments in question made to Intelsat Corporation are not a ―Royalty‖
within the provisions of Act as they exist during the year in question. (A
retrospective amendment is made in Section 9(1)(vi) by the Finance Act 2012 to
include consideration paid for the use or right to use of transmission by
satellite within the ambit of the definition of ―Royalty‖) Even after the
above amendment in the Income Tax Act, 1961, there is no change in definition
of the tern ‗Royalty‖ under the DTAA between the India- USA. Therefore, even
today the payments in question could not be taxed as ―Royalty‖ in the hands of
recipient in view of the favourable position on this issue in relevant DTAA.
These payments were made after obtaining the requisite certificates from the
Chartered Accountant (‗CA') who certified that the above sums were not
chargeable to tax in India, as it constituted business income under Article 7
of  129 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the DTAA and in the absence of
Permanent Establishment (‗PE'), same could not be liable to tax in India.
Intelsat Corporation is a non-resident company incorporated under the laws of
USA and is a tax resident of USA and, therefore, the provisions of DTAA
entered between India and USA are applicable on Intelsat which are more
beneficial to Intelsat.
For the year in question, the revenue of transmission and up-linking
facilities in the hands of Intelsat Corporation were already held not taxable
by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide order dated 28/9/2012.
The issue whether the recipient of such charges is liable to tax in India is
also settled by the Jurisdictional High Court in the case of Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co. Ltd. vs. DIT, (332 ITR 340) in favour of the taxpayer.
Similarly, such charges were also held not liable to tax in India in view of
Article 12(3) of DTAA entered between India and USA in the case of DCIT vs.
PanAmSat International System Inc (103 TTJ 861) (Del).
In view of the facts and the legal position stated above, it is clear that the
assessee Company had no liability to deduct tax on such payments under section
195 of the Act which provides that any person would liable to deduct tax if
the payments made to non-resident are chargeable to tax. When it has already
been held be the jurisdictional High Court/Tribunal that such sum is not
taxable in India in the recipient, no liability could be fastened on the payer
to deduct on such sum. Thus, the disallowance of above sum by invoking the
provisions of section 40(a)(i) of the Act will be arbitrary and unwarranted.
The legal view prevailing at the time of previous year 2008-09 was that such
payments were not chargeable to tax in India under section 9(1)(vi) read with
section 195 of the Act. Therefore the assessee Company was correct in law in
not deducting tax at source on such payments at that point of time. The  130
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, case of the assessee Company is also
supported from the fact that Intelsat Corporation was held not liable to tax
in India by the Jurisdictional High Court.
Without prejudice to above submissions on merit and in alternate, the assessee
Company most respectfully submits that on the facts of the case the
disallowance under section 40(a)(i) of the Act is unwarranted as the above
provisions are applicable only in a situation where the expenses remain
unpaid/payable as on 31st March of the previous year and no taxes have been
deducted/deposited on the same, are not applicable in the present case. To
support the above, reliance is placed on the decision in the case of Merilyn
Shipping & Transports Vs Addl. CIT, 146 ITJ 1, ITAT (Vishakhapatnam) wherein
it has been held that section 40a(ia) of the Act can be invoked only to
disallow expenditure of the nature referred to therein which is shown as
payable as on the date of balance sheet.
It is admitted fact in present case that the above amount were paid during the
year in the foreign currency as disclosed in the Audited Accounts of the year
in question Therefore, the provision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act could not
be invoked in view of the decision in the case of Merilyn Shipping &
Transports (supra) as no expenses remained as payable as on March 31, 2009\.
Thus, in alternate on this account also no addition is warranted.
The submission of assessee was duly considered and are not acceptable. The
payments made under the head Transmission and uplinking charges are covered
under the definition of royalty as define in section 9 of the I. T. Act. The
provisions of the section 9 which defines the term royalty are reproduced as
under:
Section 9 Income deemed to accrue or arise in India.
(1) The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India....
131
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(vi) income by way of royalty payable by-
(a) The Government; or
(b) A person who is a resident, except where the royalty is payable in respect
of any right,property or information used or services utilised for the
purposes of a business or profession carried on by such person outside India
or for the purposes of making or earning any income from any source outside
India; or....
(c) Provided that nothing contained in this clause shall apply in relation to
so much of the income by way of royalty as consists of lump sum consideration
for the transfer outside India of, or the imparting of information outside
India in respect of , any data, documentation, drawing or specification
relating to any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process s
or trade mark or similar property, if such income is payable in pursuance of
an agreement made before the 1 st day of April, 1976, and the agreement is
approved by the Central Government.
87a. Explanation 6 - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that
the expression "process" includes and shall be deemed to have always included
transmission by satellite (including up-linking, amplification, conversion for
downlinking of any signal), cable, optic fibre or by any other similar
technology, whether or not such process is secret...
(87a. Inserted by the Finance Act, 2012, w.r.e.f. 1-6-1976. The provisions of
section 9(1)(vi) regarding income by way of royalty were very clear and
specific. The word "process" included the Transmission and uplinking charges
however, looking to the disputes  132 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, in
the various courts and contrary judgments in this regard, a clarification /
amendment has been inserted by the Finance Act, 2012 (with retrospective
effect from 01.06.1976) which clearly says that the "process" includes and
shall be deemed to have always included transmission by satellite (including
up-linking, amplification, conversion for down-linking of any signal). In view
of the present status of the legislation the Transmission and uplinking
charges paid by the assessee without deducting any TDS would invite the
consequences of provisions of section 40(a)(i).
The assessee argument that no technical knowledge has been made available to
it therefore it is not covered in the included services. The submission of the
assessee is acceptable to the extent that no technical knowledge has been made
available. However, for royalty the requirement of make available of technical
knowledge is not required under the DTAA. It is only in the case of fee for
technical services/include services. Therefore the clause regarding make
available in the DTAA will not help the assesse in any way, from the liability
of deducting TDS on Transmission and Uplinking charges The decision of Hon'ble
ITAT Delhi in the case of PANM international system is also not applicable
because the payment of transmission and uplinking charges has now been covered
under the definition of royalty through amendment in Finance Act,2012. In the
case of PANM International system the issue examined by the Hon'ble ITAT was
regarding making technical knowledge available for the TV Channels. Where in
the case under consideration the uplinking and transmission charges are being
taken as royalty as defined u/s 9(1)(Vi).
The above definition clearly indicates that transmission and uplinking charges
are covered under the definition or royalty (process) and it has been
categorically introduce by the finance 2012 that process includes  133 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, and shall be deemed to have always included
transmission by satellite (including up-linking , amplification, conversion
for down-linkiong of any signal). Since the transmission and uplinking charges
are covered under the definition of royalty as define under the provision of
section 9 therefore any payment made in respect of royalty to a person who is
not resident in India , will also be a income deemed or accrue or arising in
India. As the expense of transmission and uplinking charges of
Rs.7,81,23,855/- to M/s Intelsat corporation is a deemed income which has
arisen in India therefore, the assesse was liable to deduct TDS on this
payment, under the provision of section 195 therefore, this payment of
transmission and uplinking charges to M/s Intelsat Corporation is not
allowable under the provisions of section 4 (a)(i). I am satisfied that the
assesse has furnished inaccurate particulars of its income and has concealed
its correct income on this issue, therefore, penalty proceedings u/s 271
(1)(C) of I.Tax Act have been separately been initiated.‖
58\. Aggrieved by the draft order of the ld Assessing Officer assessee
preferred objection before the ld DRP who vide para No. 7 of its direction
directed the AO to delete the above disallowance as under:-
> 6\. Disallowance of transmission and up-linking charges u/s 40(a)(i)
> amounting to Rs. 7.81.23.855/-
> Assessee had paid the above amount to Intelsat Corporation, a company

59\. Before us the ld DR relied upon the draft assessment order whereas the ld
AR vehemently submitted that the issue is squarely covered by the decision of
Hon‟ble Delhi High Court in case of Intelsat Corporation dated 28.09.2012. He
therefore stated that there is no error in the order of the ld DRP.
60\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and also perused the
facts of the case as well as the decision of the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court. We
are convinced with the argument of the ld AR that the issue is squarely
covered by the decision of Hon‟ble jurisdictional high court. The ld DR could
not controvert that how this issue is not squarely covered in favour of the
assessee and he also could not show us any other judicial precedent so as to
persuade us to disagree with the views of the ld DRP. Further merely because
the revenue has filed an SLP before the hon‟ble Supreme Court against the
decision of Delhi High Court cannot be a reason for sustaining the
disallowance. In view of this we do not find any infirmity in the direction of
the ld DRP in directing the ld Assessing Officer to delete the disallowance
transmission and up linking charges paid to Intelsat Corporation USA of Rs.
78123855/- In the result the ground No. 2 of the appeal of the Revenue is
dismissed.
61\. Ground No. 3 of the appeal of the Revenue is against direction of the ld
DRP to delete the disallowance of Rs. 8245612/- on account of software
expenses. During the year the assessee has incurred expenditure of
Rs.32435619/- on software expenses and claimed the same as revenue
expenditure. The ld Assessing Officer was of the view that it is capital in
nature and therefore depreciation @60% thereon is allowable and not the whole
expenditure. After considering the submission of the assessee ld Assessing
Officer held that computer software expenses to the extent of Rs. 20614030/-
shown by the assessee is disallowable as it is capital expenditure. Therefore
he allow depreciation @60% on Rs. 20614030/- amounting to Rs. 12368618/- and
thus disallowed a sum of Rs. 8245612/-. The Assessing Officer was  135 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, of the view that assessee has purchased
accounting software and its upgradation and also on software such as google
earth, pro Microsoft server calls are purchased which gives the assessee an
advantage of enduring nature. The assessee aggrieved with the order of the ld
Assessing Officer preferred objection before the ld DRP who directed the ld
Assessing Officer delete the above disallowance vide para No. 8 of its order
as under:-
> ―8. Disallowance of software expenses amounting to Rs. 82,45,612/-
> Theassessee regularly purchases softwares which are used for its programming
> purposes. TheAO has treated itas capital expenditure. This issue was
> litigated in the earlier years and Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals) has
> made the following observation on the same issue for the AY 2007-08 which
> Isreproduced below:
> ―From the submission of the appellant it is clear that the appellant has
> capitalized certain software purchases on its own. The ‗up-gradation of

> However, on going through the details, it is noticed that these software

> treated as disposed off.‖
62\. The ld DR relied upon the order of the ld Assessing Officer whereas the
ld AR relied upon the orders of the ld DRP.
63\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The assessee has been
allowed the identical claim in earlier years by the ldCIT(A) and based on that
decision the ld DRP was also of the view that the above expenditure incurred
by the assessee is revenue in nature. The ld DR could not controvert that why
the order of the ld DRP is erroneous. In view of this we do not find any
infirmity in the direction issued by the ldDRP. In the result we confirm the
direction of the DRP. In view of this ground No. 3 of the appeal of the
revenue is dismissed.
64\. In the result ITA No. 2658/Del/2014 filed by the Revenue is dismissed.
CO No. 233/Del/2014 in ITA No 2658/Del/2014 ( By Assessee)
65\. The ground No. 1 of the cross objection filed by the assessee the
assessee has stated that the appeal filed by the assessee is barred by
limitation and therefore could not be entertained and liable to be dismissed.
However, during the course of hearing no arguments were advanced by the ld AR
to show that the appeal of the Revenue is barred by limitation. In view of
absence of any argument on the same we dismiss ground No. 1 of the CO of the
assessee.
66\. Ground No. 2, 3 and 4 of the CO of the assessee are against ground No. 1
to 3 of the appeal of the Revenue. As we have already dismissed all the above
three grounds of the appeal of the revenue, therefore ground Nos. 2 to 4 of
the cross objection are also deserves to be dismissed. In view of this we
dismiss ground No. 2 to 4 of the cross objection filed by the assessee.
67\. The ground No. 5 of the cross objection of the assessee was modified by
the letter dated 11.05.2016 as under:-
> ―Modified Objection  Cross Objection No. 5 That in view of the decision of
> the Hon'ble Tribunal dated December 20, 2013 in appellant's own case on the
> allowability of ESOP expenditure for AY 2006-
137
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 07, the ld AO ought to have allowed
> the ESOP expenditure of Rs. 33835748/-
> in the year under consideration in accordance with the aforesaid decision as
> against Rs. 125271933/- claimed in AY 2006-07, Rs. 212841993/- claimed in AY
> 2007-08 and Rs. 178656690/- claimed in AY 2008-09 and further, ought to have
> excluded the reversal of ESOP expenditure offered to tax amounting to Rs.
> 8331150/- in the computation of income in the year under consideration.‖
68\. In the above ground of appeal assessee is submitting that ESOP
expenditure has already been allowed to it in AY 2006-07, AY 2008-09, however
during this year assessee has credited a sum of Rs. 8331150/- which is
required to be reversed for this year. Such reversal is also required to be
excluded from the income chargeable to tax of the assessee. The ld AR
submitted the same plea and ld DR stated that it may be dealt with in
accordance with the law by the ld Assessing Officer, as requisite facts are
not available at present.
69\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the
objection of the assessee. It is stated that ESOP expenditure has already been
allowed in AY 2006- 07 of Rs. 33835748/- whereas the assessee claimed it in
three different years. The coordinate bench for AY 2006-07 has already dealt
with this issue in favour of the assessee. With respect to the reversal of Rs.
8331150/- in the current year as stated by the ld AR it has been credited to
the profit and loss account but has not been adjusted in the computation of
total income. Therefore, according to him the sum of Rs. 8331150/- has already
been charged to tax twice. Though the above ground was not raised before the
ld DRP as well as before the ld AO, in the interest of justice we set aside
this ground of cross objection back to the file of ld Assessing Officer to
deal it in accordance with the law.
70\. In the result cross objection No. 5 is allowed with above direction.
71\. Now we come to the prayer of the assessee for the grant of permission to
raise additional cross objection as under:-
1\. The hearing in the aforesaid cross-objection No. 233/del/2014 filed by the
assessee- appellant is fixed for hearing on 30th July 2015. Along with the
138 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, aforesaid cross-objection seven more
connected matters have been fixed. In respect of all the eight matters, the
assessee has filed six paper books as well as its detailed written submissions
filed before the Hon'ble separately in order to expedite hearing in appeals.
2\. Out of the eight matters as aforesaid, four of the matters i.e. two
appeals,(one by the assessee ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 and another by the revenue
ITA No. 2658/D/2014 and two cross objections, (one by the assessee Cross
Objection No. 233/D/2014 and another by the revenue (Cross Objection No.
313/D/2014 pertains to the assessment year 2009-2010) In respect of the cross
- objection No. 233/del/2014 the assessee cross -objector prays that, it be
kindly permitted to raise following additional cross - objection which have
been set out in para 8 here below and are such grounds of cross objections,
which have been raised by the assessee-appellant on its appeal No.
1212/Del/2014. It is submitted that, such grounds of additional cross -
objections have been raised only because in the C.O. by the revenue (which are
highly belated) that the appeal filed by the assessee be held not maintainable
as according to the A.O. an assessment has been made u/s 144 of the Act. The
assessee-appellant though is disputing the contention of the revenue, yet as
advised to it and by of abundant- precaution is praying by this application
that, it be permitted to raise such grounds as additional grounds of cross-
objection.
3\. Remaining four matters pertains to two assessment year i.e. AY 2007-08 and
2008-09 which are tabulate hereunder:
Filed by Assessment Year Assessee Revenue ITA No. ITA No. 2007-08 2851/
DEL/2013 2752/DEL/2013 2008-09 3865/ DEL/2014 3996/DEL/2014
4\. All the additions which have been raised as grounds of additional cross-
objections were made in the assessment order in pursuant to the directions of
Hon'ble DRP under section 144C(5) of the Act and as stated above, the assessee
had already filed an appeal in ITA No. 1212/Del/2014, raising of all grounds
in its ground of appeal.
139
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
5\. The revenue however in the Cross Objection filed and arising from the
appeal No. 1212/Del/2014, has since raised one objection that, the said appeal
of the assesee is not maintainable on the ground that the assessment has been
framed by the AOunder section 144 of the Act, the assessee in order to avoid,
avoidable controversy is seeking permission to raise all such grounds as
additional ground of cross objection in the appeal filed by the revenue i.e.
ITA No. 2658/De/2014.
6\. The assessee thus without prejudice to its contention that, appeal filed
by the assesee bearing ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 is maintainable, respectfully
prays that, it be permitted to raise such ground as additional grounds of
cross - objection.
Additional/ Modified objections:-
Cross objection No. 6:-
That the Learned Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (Ld. AO), Circle 13(1),
New Delhi has erred both on facts and, in law in determining income of the
Appellant at Rs. 8,38,33,37,197 /- as against the returned loss of Rs.
64,83,91,422 in an order of assessment dated February 21, 2014 framed u/s 144
read with section 144C (13) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) and the
assessment framed is apparently without jurisdiction as well as barred by
limitation.
Cross objection No. 7:-
That the various findings recorded by the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP in the impugned

assessment order deserve to be deleted.
Cross objection No. 8:-
That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the instant
case in making an addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- (as sum equivalent to $150
Million) by invoking section 69A of the Act purely on surmises, conjectures
and suspicion, failing to appreciate that under section 69A of the Act, the
burden lay upon him to establish that, Appellant had made an investment of
which it is an owner and has not been recorded by it in its books of accounts.
1.4 That the Ld. AO/Ld.DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the
instant case in making an addition of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 642,54,22,000/-
by invoking section 69A of the Act even without appreciating that the
aforesaid sum was not an unexplained sum of money as the said sum was a
capital contribution made by M/s Universal Studios International BV against
the subscription of share capital and had also duly been recorded in the books
of accounts of the investee company i.e. NDTV Networks International Holdings
BV(NNIH).
1.5 That the findings of the Ld. AO that the Appellant had not complied with
the provisions of section 212 of Companies Act, as the prescribed documents
were not attached with the audited accounts is highly arbitrary and not in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and has been recorded by brushing
aside the order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which has exempted the
assessee to attach the details of the subsidiary companies with its balance
sheet.
1.6 That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP erred in applying the provisions of section 69A of
the Act by failing to appreciate that the transaction in question  141 ITA No.

Cross objection No. 9:-
That the Ld. AO/Ld. DRP has grossly erred in law and on facts of the instant
case in making an addition of Rs. 2,54,75,00,000/- (as sum equivalent to $50
Million) by invoking provisions of section 68 of the Act purely on extraneous
or irrelevant consideration and in failing to appreciate that there was no
credits in the books of Appellant and as such section 68 of the Act had no
application.
9.2 That the Ld. AO/Ld DRP grossly erred in not appreciating that the borrower
of the loan namely NDTV Networks Plc, UK (NNPLC) is a separate assessee which
is liable to be taxed separately for its income and no addition is warranted
of the aforesaid loan transaction in the total income of the Appellant under
section 68 of the Act.
Cross objection No. 10:-
Without prejudice to Cross objection No. 9 above, that the Ld. DRP exceeded
its jurisdiction while directing the Ld. AO to enhance the variations as a
result of further enquiry in respect of the loan transaction between the NDTV
Networks Plc. UK and NDTV Networks BV, as such a direction is outside the
purview of powers of the Ld. DRP in view of section 144C(8) of the Act.
10.2 That the Ld. DRP failed to appreciate that being an appellate authority
in view of the amendment in Finance Act 2012, the Ld. DRP ought not to have
issued any directions for taxing any new source of income which is not
emanating from the impugned draft assessment order.

rejecting the claim of the Appellant that it has not incurred any expenditure
in respect of the investments from which the earnings are exempt under the
Act.
Cross objection No. 12:-
That on facts of the case and in law, the Ld. TPO/AO has erred in not
discharging their statutory onus to establish that any of the conditions
specified in clause (a) to (d) of Section 92C (3) of the Act have been
satisfied before disregarding the arm's length price determined by the
Appellant and proceeding to determine the arm's length price themselves.
Cross objection No. 13:-
That Ld. AO erred in enhancing the ALP by Rs. 74,63,229/- in respect of the
international transaction pertaining to provision of business support services

comparables adopted by the Appellant and by selecting the comparables which
were not comparables on the basis of FAR (functions performed, assets employed

13.2 That the Ld. TPO erred in inadvertently considering the amount of price
received for the impugned international transaction (BSS) as Rs 7,46,87,177

incorrect computation of the adjustment.

72\. The ld AR vehemently submitted that assessee has out of the sheer
apprehension has raised this additional grounds of cross objections because of
the reason that revenue is contending that the appeal filed by the assessee is
not maintainable as the assessment has been framed u/s 144 of the Act. Though
the assessee seriously disputed it and maintains that contention of the
Revenue is incorrect but still out of abundant caution has raised additional
grounds of cross objection in this appeal. It was further submitted that it
could not be raised earlier as they were already raised in the appeal of the
assessee in ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 and the contention of the revenue about the
non-maintainability of the appeal of the assessee has arisen during the course
of hearing of this appeal. He otherwise submitted that all the grounds raised
by the assessee are legal grounds and facts are already available on record,
as the coordinate bench has heard them completely in the appeal of the
assessee. Therefore, no fresh facts are required to be examined. He therefore,
pleaded that these additional grounds of cross objection are required to be
dealt with on merits and hence, may be admitted.
73\. The ld Standing Counsel for the Revenue vehemently objected about the
admission of the additional grounds stating that it amounts to a back door
entry to the assessee  145 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, when revenue
is contending that original appeal filed by the assessee is not maintainable.
He, therefore, vehemently objected the prayer of the additional cross
objection of the assessee.
74\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and noted the
additional grounds of the cross objection raised by the assessee. In fact all
these additional grounds of CO are with respect to the original grounds taken
by the assessee in its appeal. At the time of hearing of the appeal of the
assessee we have heard all these grounds of appeal on merits for the sake of
completeness because if the appeal of the assessee survives on the issue of
maintainability then the appeal would have been required to be heard once
again which would have caused great hardship to both the parties. Therefore,
we have heard the appeal of the assessee on all the grounds including the
ground of maintainability. While deciding the appeal of the assessee we have
held that as the order passed by the ld Assessing Officer is u/s 144 of the
Income Tax Act against which the appeal of the assessee is not maintainable.
The assessee has raised the similar grounds now in this cross objection. It is
undisputed that all these issues has arisen out of the order of the ld Dispute
Resolution Panel and ld Assessing Officer. The assessee has also given reasons
that why it could not be raised earlier. Further, the grounds raised could not
be raised by the assessee for bonafide reason. In view of this in the interest
of justice we admit additional grounds of cross objection raised by the
assessee and deal with them on merit.
75\. The ground No. 6 and 7 of the CO are against the challenge to the
assessment framed as well as general averments against the finding recorded by
the ld AO as well as the ld DRP. On these grounds no specific arguments were
raised by the assessee therefore, we dismiss both of them clarifying that the
order is without jurisdiction and barred by limitation has already been
considered by us while deciding the appeal of the assessee. In no uncertain
terms we have held that ld Assessing Officer is correct in passing order u/s
144 of the Act after invoking provisions of section 145(3) coupled with
noncompliance by the assessee to various notices issued u/s 142(1) of the Act.
In view of this ground Nos 6 and 7 of the CO are dismissed.
76\. Now we come to the ground No. 8 of the cross objection wherein the
assessee challenges an addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- which is equivalent 150
million US$  146 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, made by the ld AO
invoking the provisions of section 69A of the Income Tax Act. The main issue
with respect to the addition is that assessee has a subsidiary namely NDTV
Networks International Holdings BV (Investee Company) ( herein after referred
to as „NNIH‟) formed in Netherland on 10.04.2008 has received a sum of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- on account of subscription of its shares by one company namely
M/s. Universal Studios International BV (Investor Company)( hereinafter
referred to as „USBV") which was incorporated with limited liability having
its corporate seat in Amsterdam. Investor company is also wholly owned
subsidiary of CA Holding CV legally seated in Amsterdam, Netherland. The
issued share capital of the investor company is comprising of 2680 shares of
Euro 453.78 each held by NBCU Dutch holding (Bermuda) Ltd acting in its
capacity as General Managing Partner of CA Holding CV, Bermuda. The ld
Assessing Officer was of the view that the assessee has not discharged its
primary onus in terms of section 68, 69A and other applicable provisions.
Furthermore, there was no independent valuation for determining the value of
the shares of the subsidiaries of the assessee was carried out and it was the
claim of the assessee that the subscription price was arrived at on the basis
of negotiation between the parties based on proposed potential and business
forecast and projections. Therefore, ld Assessing Officer was of the view that
the money received by the assessee through its subsidiary on account of this
investment by other company is not as per the fair value of the shares and
vide agreement dated 23.05.2008 of which assessee is a party therefore, the
above transaction is covered by the provisions of section 69A of the Income
Tax Act. The ld AO further held that assessee submitted only at the fag end of
the assessment proceedings that the sum was received by its subsidiary
deliberately so as to avoid further scrutiny with regard to identity and
creditworthiness of the sale subscriber and genuineness of the transaction.
The ld Assessing Officer was further of the opinion that the transaction of
the share capital is more doubtful in view of the admitted fact by the
assessee that the share issue price are not supported by any valuation report.
Therefore, he made an addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- to the total income of
the assessee. Assessee being aggrieved with the order of the ld Assessing
Officer preferred objection before the ld Dispute Resolution Panel. The ld
Dispute Resolution Panel vide para No. 5 of the direction held as under:-
147
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10

> crores is the focal point of this controversy.
The AO has mentioned that she was in receipt of information from various
sources including Hon'ble Members of Parliament and Ld. Members of Bar.
Further, the Investigation Wing of the Income Tax Department had also issued
summons u/s 131 to the assessee to obtain information. During the course of
the draft assessment proceedings, AO has issued enquiry letters calling for
the details of the information about the assessee and Itssubsidiary companies.
Assessee had filed additional evidence before the DRP. The same was sent to
the AO for examination and report. DRP had also sent the material received
from certain sources during the course of the DRP hearing to the AO for remand
report.
Complex structure of subsidiaries and transactions 5.1 The assessee is the
parent company of its subsidiaries located in different parts of the world.
The share holding pattern of the group entities relevant to the present
proceedings was submitted by the assessee during the course of the hearing
which is placed in the diagram below. Assessee holds 100% shares in NDTV
Networks BV, Netherlands. Further, the step down subsidiary of NDTV Networks
BV, Netherlands holds 68% of shares of NNIH Netherlands. The next step down
subsidiary NDTV BV, Netherlands has 90% share holding from NNIH Netherlands
and 10% share holding from NDTV India Ltd. (i.e. assessee). NDTV BV,
Netherlands holds 92% of shares of NDTV Networks Pic, UK and remaining 8% of
its share is held under ESOP scheme. This UK company i.e. NDTV Networks Pic,
UK has 80%- 100% shares in four different media entities located in India,
namely,  148 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NDTV Labs, NDTV Imagine, NDTV
Lifestyle and NDTV Convergence. Further, NDTV India Ltd. and NDTV Networks
Pic, UK have floated a company called Emerging Markets BV, a Netherlands based
company in which they have 50% shares each. NGEN is an entity in India which
has 50% equity coming from NDTV Networks Pic, UK and Emerging Markets BV,
Netherlands. This complex share holding structure is simplified through the
diagram.
Remarks : Prior to subscription of shares of NNIH by Universal Studios,
indirect shareholding of NDTV in NDTV Networks Pic was 92% {(100% * 100% * 90%
* 92%) + (10% * 92%)}. Subsequently, post acquisition of 31.4% stake in NNIH
by Universal Studios BV, the indirect shareholding of NDTV in NDTV Networks
Pic was 66% [(100% * 68.6% * 90% * 92%) + (10% * 92%)]  149 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 5.2 NBC Universal Inc. is an incorporated
entity in United States of America. This company has a 100% subsidiary called
Universal Studios BV, Netherlands. The transaction which is the subject matter
of this dispute is related to the acquisition of shares of NDTV Network Pic.,
UK (NNPLc) by Universal Studios BV, Netherlands indirectly by subscribing to
the shares of NNIH Netherlands. This transaction took place during the course
of the Financial Year i.e. 2008-09 which is relevant to the present assessment
year i.e. 2009-10. The shares were sold for INR 642 croresand were bought back
by NDTV Networks BV, Netherlands for INR 58 crores in the next financial year.
The starting point of the enquiry and all other subsequent proceedings are
revolving around this transaction.
Non disclosure of vital information 5.3 According to AO, as per Section 212 of
the Companies Act, 1956 as well as the Indian Accounting Standards 7, 12, 18,
19, 27, 28, 33 and 107, the transactions of the subsidiaries were to be
consolidated and disclosed in the audited accounts of the assessee since it is
the parent company of all the Netherland and UK based companies. On being
asked, the assessee produced a conditional order dated 03.07.2009 of the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs which exempted from attaching the details of
subsidiaries with its balance sheet and other accounts in terms of provision
of sub-section 8 of Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956. The AO has pointed
out that even this order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was not fully
complied with. The assessee is a listed company. The disclosure of accounts
prescribed by Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was not adhered to
in spite of the fact that the assessee has committed so to do under listing
agreement with Stock Exchange. The order of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
was issued on 03.07.2009 whereas the audited accounts of the assessee was
finalised much before that. In any case, this order exempting the assessee was
not retrospectively operative. Therefore, the lapses or omissions of not
making full and true disclosure in the audited accounts of the assessee were
not condoned by the exemption order of Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 5.4 The AO had asked for details about
these transactions through her letters during the course of the assessment
proceedings. The AO has mentioned that the requisite information was not
produced before ADIT Investigation, Unit-ll(2), New Delhi nor produced before
her during the course of assessment proceedings. Therefore, the AO has come to
the following conclusion (which is narrated on Page 46 of the draft assessment
order):
"As the material information which was required under the law to be attached
with the balance sheet of the assessee company was neither attached nor being
provided pursuant to summons issued by the Department in December 2010 nor in
response to notice issued inFebruary 2013, a reasonable belief was formed that
the accounts of the assessee are not maintained and prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Standards issued by the Central Government and were
therefore incomplete and incorrect based upon which the true and correct
income of the assessee liable to tax cannot be determined."
5.5 A show cause notice was issued by the AO to the assessee u/s 145(3) of the
IT Act r/w relevant sections of the Companies Act by stating 'why the books of
accounts should not be rejected' in accordance with Section 144 of the IT Act
and why the assessment should not be concluded under that section. Further,
the AO also contended that the assessee has also failed to comply with the
requirements of Income Tax Act as well. On Page 46 to 48 of the draft
assessment order, the AO has given reasons for rejection of the books of
accounts of the assessee and why best judgment assessment u/s 144 of the IT
Act is warranted in this case. The AO issued show cause notice to the assessee
before resorting to Section 144 of the IT Act. 5.6 The AO examined the selling
of shares of NDTV Networks Pic, UK and buying back of the same within a short
span. Neither the buyer nor the seller had done any valuation of the shares
from an independent valuer. The price of the shares was claimed to have been
negotiated by the buyer and the  151 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
seller based on the proposed business potential and business forecast and
projections. The AO has come to the following conclusion which is reproduced
for the sake of convenience:
"In view of the above, it is held that assessee has failed to discharged its
primary onus cast upon it and therefore the entire amount received by the
assessee through its subsidiaries and through an agreement dated 23.05.2008 to
which assessee is equally a party is covered by the provisions of section 69A
of the IT Act, 1961.
The said amount of Rs. 6,42,54,22,000/- was received by M/s NDTV Networks
International Floldings BV (a subsidiary of the assessee company) on account
of subscription to its shares by M/s Universal Studios International BV. As
per requirements of law and accounting standards discussed above, the said sum
should have been disclosed by the assessee. Whereas, the assessee has not
disclosed the true nature of transactions in its books of accounts /financial
statements . Moreover, it was only on 30/3/2013 i.e at the fag end of the
limitation period that the assessee stated that this amount was received by
its subsidiary company on account of subscription to shares by a foreign
company. It was done deliberately by the assessee so as to avoid further
scrutiny regarding the identity and creditworthiness of the share subscriber
and genuineness of the transactions.
The genuineness of this transaction shown as receipt of share capital becomes
all the more doubtful In view of the fact the assessee has itself admitted
that no independent valuation report wasobtained for determining the value of
shares of its subsidiary company and that the subscription price was
anegotiated price arrived at between the parties. Subscription to the shores
of the subsidiary company of the assessee without determining any valuation
forthe same and receiving such funds by a foreign party raises suspicion
regarding the true nature of the transactions.
152
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, It is a well settled law that it is the
onus of the assessee to prove the identity and creditworthiness of the share
subscribers and genuineness of the transactions. Whereas in the instant case,
the assessee could not discharge the onus cast upon it to satisfactorily prove
the nature and source of the funds received by it.
In view of the above, the assessee is found to be the owner of the unexplained
money for which it could not furnish any satisfactory explanation.
Therefore, the above said sum of Rs. 6,42,54,22,000/- is hereby held to be the
income of the assessee from undisclosed sources and the same is hereby added
to the income of the assessee."
5.7 The AO in his remand report dated 13.12.2013 has illuminated the
transaction involved in this dispute.
1) Neither NNIH nor NNPLC were having any business activities. NNIH was a
holding company and NNPLC was incorporated to promote the interest of NNIH and
other group companies.
2) NNPLC did not have any business activity nor any fixed assets and there was
no rent paid. Apart from incorporation in the United Kingdom (UK), NNPLC had
no presence in UK.
3) The address of NNPLC in UK was that of a company secretary dealing with its
tax matters.
4) Directors of NNPLC were Indian and the ultimate owner of this company is
assessee itself. The step down subsidiaries of the assessee and the share
holding structure make it very clear that the assessee is in control of all
its subsidiaries. (See the diagram above)
5) The authorized share capital of NNPLC was only about Rs. 46 lakhs.
6) NNPLC had declared a loss of Rs. 8.67 crores for the year ending
31.03.2009.
7) The shares of NNIH was not valued by an independent valuer at the time of
transaction.
8) The value of the share of NNIH at the relevant time of transaction was $ 1
per  153 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, share i.e. around Rs. 40 to
Rs. 50 approximately. These shares were sold/ subscribed at the rate of Rs.
7015.05 per share to Universal Studios BV Netherland.
9) These very shares were bought back by one of the step up subsidiaries of
NNIH (the step down subsidiary of the assessee) (see the diagram above)
namely, NDTV Networks BV, Netherlands for Rs. 634.17 per share in the
financial year 2009-10.
10) The effect of the above transaction was money introduced in the books of
subsidiaries of the assessee and booking of loss in the hand of Universal
Studios BVNetherland. By selling the shares in the very next year NBC
Universal Inc. has booked a loss of Rs. 584.46 crores and assessee has
introduced Rs. 642.54 crores.
11) As the assessee is the ultimate parent company having controlling stakes
in all its subsidiaries, it is the assessee's dictates which mattered, this is
also evidenced by the share subscription agreement dated 23.05.2008.
12) The AO in his remand report in Para 2.3.11.1 has concluded by stating that
"This subscription of shares of the assessee's group company, having face
value of Rs. 40-45 per share (equivalent to one $ in INR) by NBCU @ Rs.
7,015.05 per share and its subsequent sale back to the assessee's another
group company @ Rs. 634.17 per share, is therefore a sham transaction and it
is a fit case, which requires the lifting of the corporate veil."
13) The AO stated that the arrangement had neither commercial purpose nor any
economic substance but was only for tax evasion. The AO concluded that it is
sham, colourable or bogus transaction with the pretence of corporate and
commercial trading.
5.8 Based on the above material, the AO concluded that the money so received
by the assessee is received through a sham transaction. The corporate veil
should be lifted. The assessee is in the control of money through its
controlling stakes in the subsidiaries. The real ownership of the money was
with the assessee. The money is not recorded in the books of the assessee.
Therefore, this money should be added u/s 69A of the IT Act in the  154 ITA
No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, hands of the assessee.
Assessee'sdefence 5.9 The assessee has contended through its submissions and
oral arguments before the DRP that the transactions are genuine and the
parties to the transactions are real and their creditworthiness is beyond
doubt. The AO cannot make an addition on mere suspicion. The conditions u/s
69A are not fulfilled to make any such addition. The detailed submissions of
the assessee are summarized in the following paragraphs.
1) India has a tax treaty with Netherlands. Netherlands is a well governed tax
jurisdiction. The subsidiaries of the assessee are located in Netherlands for
the purpose of business.
2) Universal Studios BV is a subsidiary of NBC Universal USA which is in turn
owned by GE Corporation USA. GE Corporation is one of the world renowned
corporations which has well established internal governance. It is a listed
company in US. It has a huge and deep pocket to invest in ventures across the
globe. This group has invested into the shares of NNIH Netherlands. The
creditworthiness of this group who has bought/ invested into the shares of
thesubsidiary company cannot be doubted.
3) The assessee also filed annual reports of NBC Universal for FY 2008 to 2010
filed before the SecuritiesExchange Commission USA. Further, a copy of the
annual report of GE Corporation, copy ofbank account of NNIH in ING Bank
Netherlands, copy of the auditedaccount of NNIH were produced before the AO to
establish the genuineness of the transaction. The holding structure of the NBC
Universal is public available document. The transaction was recorded in the
books of all the concerned parties.
4) The transaction was through banking channels.
5) Notes to the accounts forming part of the audited accounts of the assessee
for the FY 2008-09 in Schedule 21B clearly mentions about the transaction in
item no. 20 regarding the share holders agreement between  155 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NDTV group companies with NBC Universal Inc and
its affiliate Universal Studios International BV for subscription of 26% of
effective interest stake in NNPLC for an amount of USD 150 million. Further,
the notes to accounts which is part of the audited account of the assessee in
Schedule 21B(3) clearly mentions about the transaction in the year 2009-10
about the buyback of Universal Studios International BV's 26% indirect holding
in NDTV Network Pic for a consideration of Rs. 58.8 crores: Assessee retained
majority stake in NDTV Networks Plc.
6) Notarized confirmation letter was filed before the DRP on 23.12.2013
wherein a confirmation letter of one Mr. IJ Broadband was filed about this
transaction.
7) The negotiated price of shares was based on the future projections. The
representative of the assessee explained that during the period when the
transaction took place, the Indian economy was booming. The assessee, being in
the creative field of television broadcasting, was in a position to 'sell the
dream' to a prospective investor. However, 'the dream' went bust subsequently.
Therefore, the investor sold back the investment to the assessee at a reduced
price. This was a perfectly legal and normal investment from all angles.
Investor takes huge risks and accordingly makes huge gains or huge losses.
This is part of the business. The investor being a group company of GE had
many such ventures succeeding or failing in a particular year. USD 150 million
is not a big sum to a corporation which has turnover of billions of USDs in a
year. Therefore, there is no need to suspect the transaction.
8) Ownership of the money was certainly not with NDTV India Ltd. i.e. assessee
because this was with NNIH, Netherlands. Therefore, the first limb of Section
69A is not fulfilled. It was certainly not 'recordable' in the books of the
assessee since this was recorded in the books of the subsidiary. India
recognizes independent entity approach. Therefore, the subsidiary in the  156
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Netherland was an independent entity. In
view of this, the assessee was not expected to record the transaction of its
subsidiary in its books of accounts. The bank account of the subsidiary
company was given to the AO. The source of money is from a well known group of
companies in the US. The money has come through the banking channels. Assessee
has made all efforts to explain the source of money to the best of its
abilities. There is a full disclosure on the part of the assessee. Therefore,
AO cannot make any addition only on the basis of suspicion. There is no
evidence to back the theory of money laundering.
9) Assessee relied on the following judgments to strengthen its claim apart
from relying on Agreement for Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of
Fiscal Evasion with Netherlands:
a) G.V. Films Ltd. vs. S. Priyadarshan and Anr. (C.S. No. 454 of 2005, O.A.
Nos. 543 and 2302 of 2005 and W.P.M.P. No. 19093 of 2005 and W.P. No. 17576 of
2005)
b) Vodafone International Holdings B.V. vs. Union of India and Anr. (Civil
Appeal No. 733 of 2012 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 26529 of 2010))
c) CIT vs. K.T.M.S. Mahamood (Tax Case No. 1117 of 1984)
d) Chuharmal vs. CIT, M.P. (Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 1863 of 1986)
Consideration of the DRP 5.10 DRP has considered all the material available
with it, the draft assessment order and the remand reports of the AO. Before
proceeding further, it will be of use to put the entire controversy in global
perspective. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
G20 countries are running a project known as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(BEPS). The website of OECD - http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps.htm (accessed on
24.12.2013) has the following on this issue :

At the request of G20 Finance Ministers, in July 2013 the OECD launched an
Action PTan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), identifying 15
specific actions needed in order to equip governments with the domestic and
international instruments to address this challenge. The plan recognises the
importance of addressing the borderless digital economy, and will develop a
new set of standards to prevent double non-taxation. This will require closer
international co-operation, greater transparency, data and reporting
requirements. To ensure that the actions can be implemented quickly, a
multilateral instrument to amend bilateral tax treaties will be developed.
This Action Plan was fully endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors at their July 2013 meeting in Moscow as well as the G20 heads
of state at their meetingIn Saint-Petersburg in September 2013. The actions
outlined in the plan are aimed to be deliveredwithin the coming 18 to 24
months. For the first time ever in tax matters, non- OECD/G20countries are
involved on an equal footing.
Taxation is at the core of countries' sovereignty, but in recent years,
multinational companies have avoided taxation in their home countries by
pushing activities abroad to low or no tax jurisdictions. The G20 asked OECD
to address this growing problem by creating this action plan to address base

identifies a series of domestic and international actions to address the

The introduction to Action Plan On Base Erosion And Profit Shifting document
has the following statement which is pertinent in this case which is
reproduced for the ease of reference.
―These developments have opened up opportunities for MNEs to greatly minimize
their tax burden. This has led to a tense situation in which citizens have
become more sensitive to tax fairness issues. It has become a critical issue
for all parties:
■ Governments are harmed. Many governments have to cope with less revenue and
a higher cost to ensure compliance. Moreover, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(BEPS) undermines the integrity of the tax system, as the public, the media
and some taxpayers deem reported low corporate taxes to be unfair. In
developing countries, the lack of tax revenue leads to critical under-funding
of public investment that could help promote economic growth. Overall resource
allocation, affected by tax-motivated behavior, is not optimal.
■ Individual tax pavers are harmed. When tax rules permit businesses to reduce
their tax burden by shifting their income away from jurisdictions where income
producing activities are conducted, other taxpayers in that jurisdiction bear
a greater share of the burden.
■ Businesses are harmed. MNEs may face significant reputational risk if their
effective tax rate is viewed as being too low. At the same time, different
businesses may assess such risk differently, and failing to take advantage of
legal opportunities to reduce an enterprise's tax burden can put it at a
competitive disadvantage. Similarly, corporations that operate only in
domestic markets, including family-owned businesses or new  159 ITA No.

or reduce tax. Fair competition is harmed by the distortions induced by BEPS."
India is a signatory and part of G20 Project.
5.11 The above references are important and pertinent in this case. Two
conglomerates are involved in this transaction. One is the assessee- NDTV
India Ltd. and its subsidiaries. The second is GE Group of Companies. As is
well known, NDTV has its operation mainly in India and the proposed venture of
NDTV Labs etc. (please see the diagram above) were also located in India. It
is not possible to fathom out the intention of the assessee or the
businessrationale to float the companies in Netherlands to indulge in such
complex and layered transactions. This is the precise kind of holding
structures which are the subject matter of BEPS project.
5.12 The decision of the Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of McDowell and Co. Ltd. v. CTO (1985) 3 SCC 230 is squarely
applicable to this case. Further, even the judgment in the case of Vodafone
International Holdings BV vs. Union of India (345 ITR 1) has held as follows:
"67. Similarly, if an actual controlling Non-Resident Enterprise (NRE) makes
anindirect transfer through "abuse of organisation form/legal form and without
reasonable business purpose" which results in tax avoidance or avoidance of
withholding tax, then the Revenue may disregard the form of the arrangement or
the impugned action through use of Non-Resident Holding Company, re-
characterize the equity transfer according to its economic substance and
impose the tax on the actual controlling Non-Resident Enterprise. Thus,
whether a transaction is used principally as a colourable device for the
distribution of earnings, profits and gains, is determined by a review of all
the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is in the above
cases that the principle of lifting the corporate veil or the doctrine of  160
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, substance over form or the concept of
beneficial ownership or the concept of alter ego arises. There are many
circumstances, apart from the one given above, where separate existence of
different companies, that are part of the same group, will be totally or
partly ignored as a device or a conduit (in the pejorative sense).
68\. The common law jurisdictions do invariably impose taxation against a
corporation based on the legal principle that the corporation is "a person"
that is separate from its members. It is the decision of the House of Lords in
Salomon v. Salomon (1897) A.C. 22 that opened the door to the formation of a
corporate group. If a "one man" corporation could be incorporated, then it
would follow that one corporation could be a subsidiary of another. This legal
principle is the basis of Holding Structures. It is a common practice in
international law, which is the basis of international taxation, for foreign
investors to invest in Indian companies through an interposed foreign holding
or operating company, such as Cayman Islands or Mauritius based company for
both tax and business purposes. In doing so, foreign investors are able to
avoid the lengthy approval and registration processes required for a direct
transfer (i.e., without a foreign holding or operating company) of an equity
interest in a foreign invested Indian company. However, taxation of such
Holding Structures very often gives rise to issues such as double taxation,
tax deferrals and tax avoidance. In this case, we are concerned with the
concept of GAAR. In this case, we are not concerned with treatyshopping but
with the anti-avoidance rules. The concept of GAAR is not new to India since
India already has a judicial anti-avoidance rule, like some other
jurisdictions. Lack of clarity and absenceof appropriate provisions in the
statute and/or in the treaty regarding the circumstancesIn which judicial
anti-avoidance rules would apply has generated litigation inIndia.
HoldingStructures are recognized in corporate as well as tax laws. Special
PurposeVehicles (SPVs) and Holding Companies have a place in legal structures
in India, be it in company law, takeover code under SEBI or even under the
income tax law. When it comes  161 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, to
taxation of a Holding Structure, at the threshold, the burden is on the
Revenue to allege and establish abuse, in the sense of tax avoidance in the
creation and/or use of such structure(s). In the application of a judicial
anti- avoidance rule, the Revenue may invoke the "substance over form"
principle or "piercing the corporate veil" test only after it is able to
establish on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the
transaction that the impugned transaction is a sham or tax avoidant. To give
an example, if a structure is used for circular trading or round tripping or
to pay bribes then such transactions, though having a legal form, should be
discarded by applying the test of fiscal nullity. Similarly, in a case where
the Revenue finds that in a Holding Structure an entity which has no
commercial/ business substance has been interposed only to avoid tax then in
such cases applying the test of fiscal nullity it would be open to the Revenue
to discard such inter- positioning of that entity. However, this has to be
done at the threshold. In this connection, we may reiterate the "look at"
principle enunciated in Ramsay (supra) in which it was held that the Revenue
or the Court must look at a document or a transaction in a context to which it
properly belongs to. It is the task of the Revenue/Court to ascertain the
legal nature of the transaction and while doing so it has to look at the
entire transaction as a whole and not to adopt a dissecting approach. The
Revenue cannot start with the question as to whether the impugned transaction
is a tax deferment/saving device but that it should apply the "look at" test
to ascertain its true legal nature [See Craven v. White (supra) which further
observed that genuine strategic tax planning has not been abandoned by any
decision of the English Courts till date]. Applying the above tests, we are of
the view that every strategic foreign direct investment coming to India, as an
investment destination, should be seen in a holistic manner. While doing so,
the Revenue/ Courts should keep in mind the following factors: the concept of
participation in investment, the duration of time during which the Holding
Structure exists: the period of business operations in India: the generation
of taxable revenues in India: the timing of the exit: the continuity of
business on such exit."

2.3.10.2 Further, vide letter dated 24.10.2013, the assessee has filed copies
of submissions claimed to have been filed during the assessment proceedings,
copy of Ld. CIT(A)'s order for AY 2007-08 in the case and copies of some
notices issued by the AO.
2.3.10.3 No confirmation from NBCU regarding the transaction has been filed at
163 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, all. Had it been a normal business
transaction, it would be necessary for the assessee to file confirmation from
NBCU, which would be subject to verification by the AO, by calling upon the
assessee to file an affidavit from NBCU or to produce the authorized
representative of NBCU to confirm the assertions. However, no such
confirmation has been filed by the assessee and therefore, it cannot be said
that the onus has been discharged by the assessee even in the context of
section 68 or section 69A of the Act, as sought to be justified by the
assessee in its letter dated 29.11.2013.
2.3.10.4 However, the fact remains that the transaction of subscription of
shares of NNIH by NBCU is not a normal transaction and lacks commercial
purpose or economic substance in view of the facts as discussed in para 2.3.9
above. Hence, not only the assessee has failed to discharge its onus u/s 68 /
69A as claimed by the assessee, but also in the present case, the facts of the
case cast a serious shadow on the genuineness of the impugned transaction,
which has neither any commercial purpose nor any economic substance.
2.3.11 The assessee has also contended that regarding the subscription rate,
share premium forms part of share capital and is to be decided by the Board of
Directors. It is contended that there is no bar in law regarding the amount of
premium that a company can charge. However,it remains to be a part of the
share capital only. It is further contended that the channels of NDTV had a
huge potential for growth and hence, it formed direct and indirect
subsidiaries abroad to attract foreign investment, one of which is NNPLC. It
is also contended by theassessee that the investments of NNPLC in various
companies of entertainment verticalsalready existed much before the share
subscription and all those invested companies were functional. On this basis,
it was claimed that the amount of share premium charged was genuine.
164
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.3.11.1 On this issue, it is observed that
the factual matrix of the case reveals that 915948 shares of NNIH having face
value of Rs. 50 approx, per share were purported to be subscribed by NBCU @
Rs. 7015.05 per share. Although it is correct that in appropriate
circumstances, a company can always decide the amount to be charged as share
premium and there is no bar in law, which prohibits the company from doing so,
yet in the present case, mere assertion regarding the right to charge the
desired share premium does not absolve the assessee, when it is established
that there is no commercial purpose or economic substance to the transaction
for NBCU. The explanation that NNPLC was already holding investments in
running entertainment verticals is of no value, when it is observed that NNPLC
was making losses and during the relevant year, NNPLC had made a loss of Rs.
8.34 crores app. and the book value of its share was in the negative. What
economic substance or commercial purpose could be there for NBCU in
subscribing shares of a company, whose shares have a face value of only Rs.
40-45 per share, which would result in acquiring 26% effective indirect stake
in NNPLC, which is only an investment company, has no business of its own,
having recently formed, does not have any proven performance record, whose
shares have a negative book value and which was actually liquidated within 3 %
years of the transaction,(the duration of time during which the Holding
Structure exists- factor as in Vodafone case} Needless to say, any investment,
not to say an investment of Rs. 642.54 crores, would be made only with a view
to earn profits, because that is the only commercial purpose or the economic
substance. It is also pertinent to reiterate that no independent valuation was
ever carried out by the group companies or by the NBCU and the issue rate as
well as the repurchase rate are claimed to be solely based on estimates and
business projections. Hence, there could not be any commercial purpose or the
economic substance for NBCU to invest Rs. 642.54 crores in NNIH and barely a
year later, to sell the said equity back to NDTV group company for merely Rs.
58.08 crores.(the timing of the exit- factor as in Vodafone case}77)e only
purpose apparent from the transaction is to create a loss of Rs. 584.46 crores
for NBCU and to bring the taxable income of the assessee amounting to Rs.
642.54 crores, earned from undisclosed sources, into  165 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the books of accounts of the assessee through
its subsidiaries. This subscription of shares, of the assessee's group
company, having face value of Rs. 40-45 per share by NBCU @ Rs. 7,015.05 per
share and its subsequent sale back to the assessee's another group company @
Rs. 634.17 per share, is therefore a sham transaction and it is a fit case,
which requires the lifting of the corporate veil.
2.3.11.2 It is settled law that if an arrangement has no commercial purpose or
economic substance and its purpose is merely to evade tax and to constitute
sham, colourable or bogus transactions with the pretence of corporate and
commercial trading, then in such circumstances, it is not only possible but
necessary to lift the corporate veil. Once we lift the corporate veil in the
context of the impugned transaction in the present case, the clear facts
emerging regarding the transaction reveal that the transaction isengineered to
result in claim of loss to NBCU and corresponding routing of the assessee's
own undisclosed money through its subsidiary.
2.3.12 Regarding the NNPLC's accounts being signed in India and its directors
being India, it was contended that this was factually incorrect. The accounts
of NNPLC placed on record were stated to be those which were used for the
purpose of consolidation of financial statements of NDTV group as a whole to
comply with the provisions of the Companies Act. The assessee further claimed
that this office had received information from HMRC, UK through the Treaty
provisions, whereby the existence of NNPLC was confirmed.
2.3.12.1 On this issue, it is observed that the assessee was the ultimate
parent company and the issue of shares and subsequent repurchase as above by
its group companies was not without its directions. Rather, the assessee was
itself a party to the agreement and thus, it was the assessee, which dictated
terms as to the transaction. The position of the group company NNIH or NNPLC
was no more than an agent of the assessee. Regarding the money amounting to
Rs. 642.54 crores also, it was the assessee, which was in ultimate control of
the money. As discussed above, the facts only necessitate lifting of corporate
veil in the case, as the assessee cannot be permitted to hide behind the
corporate veil  166 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.

the impugned colourable device engineered to result in tax evasion.
2.3.13 Reliance in this regard was also placed by the assessee on the
following case laws :-
> (i) CIT vs Sofia Finance Ltd. 205 ITR 98
> (ii) CIT vs Divine Leasing & Finance Ltd. 207 ITR 38
> (iii) CIT vs Allahabad Bank Ltd. 73 ITR 745

> of the cited cases, there is any finding of buyback of shares at a nominal
> price or that of being a colorable device in place, resulting in tax
> evasion.
2.3.14 Lastly, the assessee also stated that the Hon'ble DRP's directions were
limited to objections with respect to additions made under section 69A of the
Act and were to examine the additional evidence filed by the assessee vide
applications dated 29.04.2013 and 24.10.2013, but the queries raised by this
office regarding the transaction of NNIFI were stated by the assessee as not
arising from the said directions. The assessee also suggested that this office
was changing its opinion to make fishing and roving enquiries to tax the
aforesaid sum on one pretext or the other.
2.3.15 Regarding the above, it is observed that the assessee's contention is
factually Incorrect. It Is Incorrect to suggest that the Hon'ble DRP's
directions were limited to objections with respect toadditions made under
section 69A of the Act and were to examine the additionalevidence filed by the
assessee vide applications dated 29.04.2013 and 24.10.2013. As stated in para
2.1.4 above, the Hon'ble DRP remanded the matter regarding proposed addition
of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- u/s 69A with directions to ascertain the taxability of
this sum for AY 2009-10. Hence, the assessee's contention, being based on a
factual inaccuracy, is not acceptable.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.3.16 In view of the above, it is
submitted that it is necessary to lift the corporate veil in the case and to
assess the transaction in view of its real purport.
2.3.17 In its further reply dated 10.12.2013, the assessee has reiterated its
earlier contentions, which are repetitive in nature and have already been
addressed in the earlier part of this report. The assessee has further
discussed the ingredients of section 69A and has contended that these are not
present in its case.
2.3.16.1 In respect of the assessee's above contentions, it is observed that
upon lifting the corporate veil, which is both permissible and necessary in
the case, it is clearly visible that the assessee is the ultimate parent
company and the issue of shares and subsequent repurchase as above by your
group companies was under the dictates of the assessee, which as per agreement
also, was also a party to the transaction. Accordingly, the assessee was in
ultimate control of the money. The real ownership of money was with the
assessee. Hence, the addition u/s 69A is correctly made by the AO in the draft
assessment order. The condition for applicability of section 69A is not that
the money should be in actual possession or control of the assessee. Rather,
the condition is that the assessee should be the owner of the money, which is
fulfilled in the present case.
2.1.16.2 The second condition of section 69A is that the money is not recorded
in the books of accounts of the assessee. In the present case, it is
undisputed that the money is not recorded in the assessee's account books.
2.1.16.3 The third condition is that the explanation offered by the assessee
about the nature and source of money is not satisfactory. As elaborately
discussed in the above paras of this report, the explanation given by the
assessee about the nature and source of this money is neither satisfactory nor
tenable.

view of the above facts and circumstances of the case, involving the round
tripping involving such huge variations in the rates without any basis or

necessitates the piercing of corporate veil. It is therefore submitted that

2.3.18.1 As discussed above, the receipt of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- represents the
assessee's own taxable income earned by it from undisclosed sources and the
same is taxable u/s 69A and the AO has correctly proposed the addition on this
account in the draft assessment order. However, without prejudice to the
above, it is submitted that the transaction also results in arising of income
from capital gains in the hands of the assessee.
2.3.18.2 At the cost of repetition, it is stated that during the year under
consideration, the assesse New Delhi Television Ltd. (NDTV), along with four
of its subsidiaries namely NDTV BV, NDTV Networks BV (NNBV), NDTV Networks
International Holdings BV (NNIH) and NDTV Networks Pic (NNPLC), had entered
into an agreement dated 23.05.2008 with NBC Universal Inc. (NBC) and Universal
Studios International BV (USBV). As a result, an amount of Rs. 642,54,22,000/-
(US $150 million) was received during the year by NNIH. The amount was
received on account of subscription of 915,498 shares into NDTV Networks
International Holdings BV equivalent to 26% effective indirect stake in NDTV
Networks Pic. 2.3.18.3 The corporate structure used for the transaction is as
under  169 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NNPLC 2.3.18.4 From the above,
it is clear that NDTV had a 56.80% stake in its indirect subsidiary NNPLC,
915,498 shares (26% equity) of which was reduced on account of referred
transaction with NBC and USBV as stated above. As per the provisions of the
Income Tax Act, 1961rthe Act"), the transaction attracts tax on resultant
capital gains in the hands of NDTV.
2.3.18.5 NDTV Is a tax resident of India and section 5 of the Act provides
that its global Income It taxable In India. Under section 45 of the Act, gain
arising from transfer of a capital Quit It chargeable to tax under the head
'Income from Capital Gains'. Capital asset has been defined by section 2(14)
as being property of any kind held by the assessee andExplanation of section
2(14) provides that property includes the rights of management and control, or
any rights whatsoever, in a company by virtue of shareholding in the company.
2.3.18.6 Prior to the referred transaction, NDTV was having 56.80% stake in
NNPLC. As such, it was having the rights of participation, management and
control in the NNPLC to that extent, which was the property of NDTV and was
also a capital asset of NDTV within the meaning of section 2(14) of the Act.
Vide agreement dated  170 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 23.05.2008,
this capital asset owned by NDTV was transferred to NBC and USBV, because by
disposing of 26% equity in NNPLC, the stated stake, and consequently, the
corresponding rights of participation, management and control owned by NDTV in
NNPLC are extinguished to that extent. As such, the gains rising to NDTV as a
result of this transfer of capital asset were chargeable to tax under section
45 of the Act.
2.3.18.7 As such, vide letter dated 11.11.2013, the assessee was asked to
explain the issue. In response, vide reply dated 26.11.2013, the assessee
contended that it was a case of fresh issue of shares and there was no
transfer of property within the meaning of section 2(47) of the Act. It was
further contended that mere transfer will not trigger capital gains tax unless
it results in accrual of consideration. However, it is observed that as
explained above, the transaction has resulted in transfer of interest in
equity as defined in section 2(14) of the Act. Further, the assessee was
itself a party to the transaction and was therefore instrumental in dictating
the terms of the agreement. Although the consideration is claimed to have been
credited in the account books of NNIH, yet in reality, the owner of the money
is the assessee only.
2.3.18.8 In view of the above, it is submitted that without prejudice to the
submissions that the impugned amount is taxable u/s 69A in the assessee's
hands, it is submitted that the said amount is otherwise also taxable u/s 45
of the Act."

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(i) NDTV through its (i) NDTV has stated in its Annual Report that 2009-10
subsidiary NDTV NDTV through its subsidiary NDTV Networks BV Networks BV,
repurchased 26 percent repurchased 26 indirect stake held by NBC Universal
Inc., in percent indirect stake its subsidiary NDTV Networks Pic. Though held
by NBCU in the shares purportedly subscribed, not NNPLC. purchased, by NBCU
were those of NNIH and

NNIH, yet it can be seen that the emphasis is Million Step up on NNPLC and
there is no reference to NNIH or Coupon Convertible NDTV BV.
Bonds issued by it earlier. It is further pertinent to mention that the
repurchase, occurring barely after 18 months, was for about Rs. 58 crores only
as against the 'purchase' for Rs. 642.54 crores. There is no rationale in this
transaction - no commercial purpose or economic substance, other than to
create a loss of Rs. 584 crores for NBCU and introduction of own unaccounted
money for NDTV.
(ii) The final transaction before the liquidation of NNPLC was the purported
repurchase of Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds. However, the price of the
coupons reflected at Rs. 399 crores as on 31.03.2008 and at Rs. 509.50 crores
as on 31.03.2009 (the difference of Rs. 110.50 crores stated to be on account
of currency fluctuation) would further escalate at the time of repurchase and
when NNPLC had a capital of Rs. 40 lacs only and investment in loss making
companies, then it remains to be verified as to how NDTV / NNPLCdischarged its
liability towards the principal andinterest payable to the investors on the
said repurchase.
{the generation of taxable revenues in India -
factor as in Vodafone case} 2.1.19 From the above, the inevitable conclusion
is that NNPLC was a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created by NDTV, which acted
as agent of NDTV for the  174 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, purposes of
NDTV and was liquidated as soon as it had outlived the purpose of its
creation,{the continuity of business on such exit- factor as in Vodafone case}
2.1.20 In the case of Adams vs Cape Industries Pic [(1990) 2 WLR 6578], it was
held that one of the three circumstances in which the corporate veil may be
lifted would be in a situation, where the subsidiary is an agent of the
company. In the present case, the situation is the same and the business
affairs of the holding company NDTV and the subsidiary NNPLC are so
intertwined that it is not only permissible but necessary to lift the
corporate veil. The intertwining is evident from the fact that NNPLC carried
out only two major transactions during its existence - the 1st transaction was
to raise USD 100 million through Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds, which was
possible only due to undertaking for corporate guarantee offered by NDTV and
NDTV was a party to the Agreement along with NNPLC and the 2 nd transaction
was the indirect transfer of 26% of its stake to NBCU by way of subscription
in equity of parent company NNIH, in which again, NDTV was a party to the
Agreement along with NNPLC. In both transactions, it was NTYDV which dictated
the terms and in neither of the two transactions, NNPLC acted independently.
Under these circumstances, it is evident that NNPLC is a mere fagade entity on
behalf of NDTV ; and without prejudice to this, NNPLC is beyond doubt an agent
of NDTV.
2.1.21 As such, it is a fit case, in which corporate veil needs to be lifted
and once the veil is lifted, with regard to the present proceedings for AY
2009-10, it can be observed as under :-
                         (i)     NDTV     through    NNPLC      has     introduced       its   own
                                 unaccounted      income     from     undisclosed         sources
amounting to Rs. 642.54 crores in the garb of equity subscription. Detailed
report regarding taxability of this sum has already been submitted to the
Hon'ble DRP vide letter no. 1794 dated 11.12.2013.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NDTV through NNPLC has enhanced the
liability on account of Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds by Rs. 110.50 crores
in the Balance Sheet of NNPLC from Rs. 399 crores to Rs. 509.50 crores, which
is stated to be on account of currency translation. Further, NDTV has
Introduced unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores from NDTV BV in the
books of NNPLC. The tax implications of this issue are the subject matter of
the present report, which necessitated the lifting of corporate veil first, as
discussed in the preceding paras of this report* [Bold and underlined lines In
flower brackets are added by the DRP] 5.16 DRP has carefullyconsidered entire
gamut of transaction and is of the opinion that the structure of
holding/subsidiary companies and the transaction as narrated above,without any
commercial substance, do warrant lifting the corporate veil to identify the
true nature of the transaction. Though AO in his remand report has said that
the money has not been recorded in the books of assessee, after lifting the
corporate veil, the DRP finds that in this case a sum of Rs. 642,54,22,000/-
has been found credited in the books of assessee/ its subsidiary for the
previous year (FY 2008-09) under consideration. Though the assessee has sought
to explain the above amount through the lengthy and circuitous transactions,
the commercial substance/ economic rationale for such transaction has not been
satisfactorily explained. Assessee's theory of having sold a "Dream" to the
investor has not been substantiated by any credible evidence as no details
have been filed whatsoever for the so called business projections and the
basis for computation of the sale price of the share at the astronomical price
of Rs. 7,015/- which is 159 times of its face value of Rs. 45/-. Needless to
mention that the subject company whose shares were sold was incurring huge
losses and there was hardly any worthwhile business to justify the above sale
price. Interestingly, the assessee/ subsidiaries have again repurchased the
same share in the very next financial year at the price of Rs. 634.17 per
share totallingRs. 58 crores. Here also no details/ justification has been
given by the assessee as to how the above buy back price was fixed by the
assessee when the so called  176 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, "Dream"
went bust, as being claimed by assessee. What was the justification for the
assessee to buy back the shares of nearly defunct and own subsidiary company
at a value which was more than 12 times of the face value. The totality of the
transaction clearly lead to the inescapable conclusion that the entire
transaction of sale & subsequent buy back of shares was a "sham" transaction
entered into by the assessee with the sole motive of introducing Rs.
642,54,22,000/- in its books and providing loss of Rs. 584.46 crores to
Universal Studios BV Netherlands.
5.16.1. In view of the facts and finding as mentioned above and taking the
totality of the picture into consideration, it is held that assessee has
brought an amount of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- being unexplained money in to its
books through its subsidiary NDTV Networks BV Netherlands. It is pertinent to
mention that, as per the admission of the assessee the above subsidiary has
been subsequently liquidated, which shows that the same was floated only to
create a front for introducing the above amount.
5.16.2. The DRP has considered the addition proposed by the AO and finds the
addition is fully justified in view of facts mentioned above. The DRP is of
the considered opinion that the facts of the case fits for making addition u/s
68 of the IT Act as unexplained cash credit. Even addition u/s 69A as proposed
by the AO is also justified, as after lifting the corporate veil, the assessee
is found owner/ controller of the money under reference.
5.17. AO has brought to the notice of the DRP through his letter dated
20.08.2013 forwarded by the Addl. CIT,Range-13, New Delhi that an amount of
Rs. 365.25 crores was raised by the assessee company which needed further
examination. The relevant part of the letter of the AO is as under:
> "10. Another issue involved in the case is that during the year, the
> assessee company, through its guarantees, raised an amount of Rs.
177
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10

> the identity of the payers, the creditworthiness of the payers and the
> genuineness of the transactions."
5.18. Accordingly, the AO was directed to examine this issue and send a remand
report. The remand report was given to the assessee who strongly objected to
the proposed addition made by the AO in the remand report. The remand report
dated 11.12.2013 and the summary of the oral argument of the AO dated
26.12.2013 are reproduced below:
> Extract of remand report dated 11.12.2013 "2.4 Tax implication of unsecured

> subsidiary NDTV Network Pic ("NNPLC") and the tax implication thereof.
2.4.2 Vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated 11.11.2013, the assessee was
asked to explain on the issue as under :-
> "2.3 During the year, the assessee company, through its guarantees, raised

2.4.3 In response, vide letter dated 26.11.2013, the assessee contended that
during the year under consideration, there was an increase of Rs. 110.50
crores in the amount of unsecured loans in the Balance Sheet of NNPLC, which
represented  178 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, an increase due to
currency fluctuation. The assessee further stated that during the previous AY
2008-09, it had raised loans amounting to Rs. 399 crores by way of Step Up
Coupon Bonds and the enquiry regarding the source and genuineness thereof had
already been completed during the course of assessment proceedings for AY
2008-09. It was claimed that complete evidence regarding the same had been
filed before the AO during the said assessment proceedings and the AO had also
obtained information from HMRC through FT & TR. Vide further reply dated
29.11.2013, the assessee also filed copy of exchange rates for the relevant
period. 2.4.4 Vide this office's letter dated 05.12.2013, the assessee was
confronted as under :-
"2.2 Regarding the raising ofRs. 365.25 crores as unsecured loans 2.2.1

other relevant details claimed to have been filed during the course of the
assessment proceedings for AY 2008-09.

2.2.4 In this regard, please also refer to letter filed by you on 29.11.2013,
wherein you have stated that the increase of Rs. 110.50 crores in the Step Up
Coupon Bonds is merely the reinstatement of foreign currency liability. In
this regard, please furnish the relevant copies of accounts along with
complete book entries made in Journal, Ledger, etc. in respect of the said

2.2.2 Vide this office letter dated 05.12.2013, the assessee was informed that
no such documents were found in the aissessment record for AY 2008-09. The
assessee vide letter dated 09.12.2013 stated that it was again filing copy of
the submission dated 08.02.2012 filed in the course of assessment of AY
2008-09 before AO, which consisted of the complete list of the subscribers to
bonds, subscription agreement and other relevant details and documents
enclosed as Annexure B. Copies of submissions dated 28.05.2012,  182 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 31.05.2012, 11.06.2012 and 20.07.2012 stated to
have been filed before the then AO and copies of submissions dated 18.02.2011,
03.03.2011, 08.03.2011, 29.03.2011 and 30.03.2011 stated to have been filed
before the Investigation Officer and DIT were also claimed to have been
enclosed as Annexure C1-C5.
2.2.3 However, perusal of the documents enclosed by the assessee reveals that
inresponse to requisition to prove the identity of the investors, their
creditworthiness and genuineness of the transactions, the assessee has filed
merely a list titled 'The Initial Investors", listing out 8 entities, many of
them from Cayman Islands and furnishing of such list does not discharge the
assessee of its onus to prove the identity and creditworthiness of the
entities or the genuineness of the transactions.
2.2.4 It is pertinent to mention that even though the original amounts on
account of these bonds are claimed to have been received last year and not in
the financial year relevant to AY 2009-10, yet when the original amount itself
is not proved to be on account of genuine transaction, any escalation in the
same whether due to currency translation or otherwise must necessarily meet
the same fate. Hence, the amount of Rs. 110.50 crores, being enhancement
during the year, in the original liability from unproved source, is proposed
to be added to the assessee's taxable income forAY 2009-10.
2.3 Regarding introduction of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores
from NDTV BV in the books ofNNPLC 2.3.1 During the year under consideration,
NDTV through NNPLC has raised unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores as
mentioned in the relevant Schedule to Balance Sheet as on 31.03.2009. When
asked vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated 11.11.2013, the assessee
replied that the unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores hadbeen raised
from NNPLC's intermediate holding company NDTV Networks BV and the relevant

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.3.2 Vide letter dated 05.12.2013, it was
intimated to the assessee that on perusal of assessment record for AY 2008-09,
no such documents were found. Accordingly, the assessee was given an
opportunity to now file these documents, which were being claimed to have been
filed by it earlier. The assessee was also intimated that it had not
discharged the onus cast upon it in respect of the above transactions of
raising unsecured loans. 2.3.3 In response, the assesse filed reply dated
09.12.2013 stating that with respect to the unsecured loans amounting to Rs.
254.75 crores, the source thereof was loan form NDTV Networks BV and the
amount was duly disclosed in the books of NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV and the
copies of the financials statements of both the above subsidiaries were filed
before the Ld. AO during the course of assessment vide submission dated
27.02.2013 & 11.03.2013. The copies of the said submissions were claimed to be
duly enclosed as Annexure El & E2 of the reply dated 09.12.2013.
2.3.4 I have perused the assessee's letters dated 27.02.2013 (running into 10
pages)&11.03.2013 (running into 2 pages) marked as Annexure El and Annexure E2
respectively. At the outset, it is submitted that there is no reference to the
impugned issue of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores raised during
the year. The contents of the referred letters address certain queries raised
by the AO and query regarding unsecured loans is not one of such queries. The
bare letters are not even supported by any Annexures mentioned ion the said
letters.
2.3.5 Under the circumstances, when the attached annexure-less letters do not
contain any reference to query regarding unsecured loans nor attempt to
address such query, therefore, filing of such letters does not serve any
purpose. 2.3.6 It is pertinent to mention that during the course of hearing
before the Hon'bleDRP on 23.12.2013,the assessee has filed a reply on the
issue. It has been stated by the assessee that theImpugned unsecured loan has
been raised pursuant to Loan Agreement dated 10,11.2008betweenUniversal
Studios International BV, NDTV, NNPLC and NDTV NetworksBV. Confirmationfrom
Universal Studios International BV is also stated to be attached,However,  184
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, perusal ofthe attached confirmation reveals
that although there is a ffltntlOnregarding the bank accountof Universal
Studios International BV, namely BNP Paribas and copy of bank certificate
Isstated to have been attached, yet no bank certificate has been actually
attached.
2.3.7 In view of the above, it is submitted that the assessee cannot be said
to havedischarged its onus of proving the identity of the lender,
creditworthiness of the lender and the genuineness of the transaction. Even
the copies of documents, wherever furnished by the assessee, are photocopies,
not subject to any verification or enquiries. It is pertinent to place on
record that any specific issues can be proved only by specific evidence and
not on the strength of claimed reputation or volume of business of the lender.
Hence, the assessee has not been able to prove the source of addition in
unsecured loans and the same is proposed to be added to the assessee's taxable
income." 5.22. DRP has carefully considered this issue. Out of Rs. 365.25
crores representing unsecured loan, under reference, an amount of Rs. 110.5
crores is due to the restatement of the original amount pertaining to a
transaction happened in the FY 2007-08 which was the subject matter of
assessment for the AY 2008-09. It appears from the report that there was no
disallowance made on the amount in the first place in the AY 2008-09.
Therefore, to disallow Rs. 110.5 crores on account of reinstatement of the
amount is not called for as rightly mentioned by the AO in his remand report
dated 11.12.2013. (quoted in the earlier paragraph no. 5.18 on Page no. 22
onwards) 5.23. The AO has examined the said agreement and in his response
dated 26.12.2013 has clearly brought out that even after the production of the
copy of the agreement assessee has not discharged its onus of explaining the
genuineness of the transaction. From a bare reading of the so called agreement
copy by the DRP, it is found that the above loan is advanced without any
interest, the reason for which has not been explained. The amount involved is
quite a large sum of money. Further, as per this document, the interest free
credit facility was to be granted on the basis of a duly completed utilization
request, where as no such utilization request or basis fpr seeking the above
credit facility has been produced by the assessee before the AO or before the
DRP. We are therefore in agreement with the  185 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, AO's finding that the onus of proving the genuineness of the
loan transaction has not been discharged by the assessee. The AO is,
therefore, directed to make addition of Rs. 254.75 crores."
77\. Based on the above direction of the ld DRP, the ld Assessing Officer held
that transaction involved in the receipt of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- by the
assessee‟s company during the year is a sham transaction through which the
assessee has introduced its own unaccounted money and therefore, it represents
the unexplained money owned by the assessee regarding the nature and source of
which the assessee has not been able to offer satisfactory explanation, hence,
the ld AO made the addition u/s 69A of the Act of Rs. 6425422000/-. Therefore,
the assessee being aggrieved has preferred the ground in cross objection.
78\. The ld AR vehemently contested the addition. He referred to page No. 1 to
104 of the paper book, wherein, a shareholders agreement was entered into on
23.05.2008 between seven parties was placed. He submitted that this agreement
shows the fact that NBC Universal Inc., Universal Studios International BV,
New Delhi Television Ltd, BDTV BV, NDTV Networks BV, NDTV Networks
International Holding BV and NDTV Networks PLC has entered into an agreement
for the purpose of regulating the affairs of company i.e. NDTV networks
International Holding BV, NDTV PLC and other group companies and the NBC
Universal Inc. wishes to expand its presence in India. He submitted that NDTV
Network International Holdings BV at that time was holding almost 90% of the
share capital of NDTV BV who in turn holds 92% of issued share capital of NDTV
PLC. By this agreement it was agreed that the Universal Studios International
BV which subscribes for share in the NDTV Network International Holding BV
pursuant to the further shares subscription agreement of the even date. He
further referred to share subscription agreement dated 23.05.2008 which his

agreement dated 23.05.2008 entered into between NDTV Networks International

was mentioned in Clause NO. 4 that subscription share consideration of US$ 150

therefore, such sum cannot be the income of the assessee holding company. He

show the confirmation of the investor company. He also referred to page No.
670 to 673 of the paper book to show the share issue deed evidencing that the
shares were issued to the investor company on receipt of share capital of US$
150 million. He further referred to page No. 674 to show the bank certificate
from BNP PARIBAS from which account a sum of US$150 million was transferred to
the account of the investee company. He further referred to page NO. 722 to
725 of the paper book which is a Apostled company of confirmation from the
investor dated 11.12.2013. He further referred to page No. 676 to 718 wherein,
the annual report of Universal Studios International BV for 2008 was submitted
. He referred to the fact that the investor company has invested in the
investee company. He specifically referred to page No. 692 to 693 of the paper
book to show that investor company has acquired 31.4% participating interest
in the investee company. He further submitted that investor is a part of
General Electric (GE) group company, which is one of the largest global
business conglomerate whose identity and creditworthiness could not have been
doubted. He referred to the balance sheet of GE for 2009 annual report for
this purpose. He further referred to Form No. 10K of the United States

submitted that original investment was made for US$150 million in May 2008 and
it was subsequently off loaded in November 2009 at a loss of US$118 million.
He further referred to agreement dated 14.10.2009 which is agreement for sale

Inc. Group.
79\. After making above submission the ld AR referred to the profile of the
NBC Group downloaded from Wikipedia to state that investor company is a very
large group of highest repute which was founded in 1926 and therefore
allegation against such a group is unfounded. He further submitted that all

RAISED BY THE SUBSIDIARY OF THE APPELLANT COMPANY AND, BROUGHT TO TAX BY
HOLDING THE SAME TO UNEXPLAINED MONEY U/S 69A OF THE ACT 26.1 The crux of the
dispute in the present case is, whether the learned A.O.
was correct in holding that the amount received by way of subscription of
shares by NDTV Networks International Holdings BV of the subsidiary is
assessee's own money and the transaction of issue of shares by assessee's
subsidiary to M/s Universal Studios International BV is a sham transactions

duly established in terms of the judgment of Apex Court in the case of CIT v
Lovely Exports (P) Ltd reported in 319 ITR 5 (St.) 26.2 It is submitted at the
outset that the said share subscription was received by the assessee's
subsidiary company namely NDTV Networks International Holdings BV and not by

company of the said investor is NBC Universal Inc., a company incorporated in
USA and thus to hold the transaction as a sham transaction and the money
invested was the money of the assessee is merely an allegation and, is
unsupported by any evidence. In fact all what the assessee wants to submit is
that, the transaction was not a sham transaction and the allegation that money
belonged to assessee is contrary to material on record and unsubstantiated

section 69A of the Act has no application as the same is duly recorded in the
books of the investee company when the investment was made and thus on neither
of the grounds, the addition is tenable. 26.6 In light of the above back

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the A.O. and the DRP that the transaction is
sham is merely a matter of conjecture, surmises and is based on illogical
conclusion which it is submitted is unilateral. It is submitted, though it may
be permissible for tax authorities to draw inference yet such inference had to
be drawn based on material and not on mere ipsi-dixit.
27 In the instant case, it is submitted that, the findings of the authorities
that the `transaction is sham is based on a finding that the structure of the
assessee company is complex (see para 5.1 page 3 of Appeal Set). It is
respectfully submitted that, appellant had not been able to comprehend the
basis for such finding and conclusion. It is apparent that the basis for such
an allegation is that, it has large number of companies, who are its
subsidiaries. It is submitted firstly, that out of twenty one subsidiaries, 10
companies are incorporated under Companies Act 1956 in India and the remaining
11 companies are incorporated outside India under the respective laws of such
companies. The fact that, there are large numbers of subsidiary company does
not by itself make the structure of the company to be complex. Thus the
foundation on which the revenue has proceeded to hold the transaction to be
sham is entirely misconceived and misplaced 27.1 It further appears that in so
far as the some of the companies which are incorporated outside India are
concerned, it has been alleged that, (i) such companies did not carry on any
business or (ii) they were incorporated for a short duration. However, it is
submitted that the fact, they did not carry on any business or that they
existed only for a short duration cannot be regarded as any valid basis unless
until it could have been established that, such a company was either not
incorporated in law or was a dummy concern of the appellant company. In any
case, admittedly the shareholder of in M/s NDTV Networks International
Holdings BV was M/s NDTV Networks BV, who had acquired all the shares of in
M/s NDTV Networks International Holdings BV. It is submitted that M/s NDTV
Networks BV, is a company incorporated on 9.1.2008 in Netherland. It is
submitted that, it is also on record that the said company is an investment
company. It is also undisputed fact that there has been no finding or adverse
observation made by the assessing authority that either under the Income Tax
Act or any other Act that such company was dummy or non-existing company. In
view of the aforesaid it is submitted the observation/ finding by the
authorities in their respective orders i.e. directions of the DRP and the
assessment order impugned before the Bench that the transaction was sham, is
based on speculation, surmises and conjectures.
27.2 It is submitted that it is well accepted that a subsidiary and its
holding company are distinct and separate entities. They are subject to income
tax on the profits derived by them on standalone basis, irrespective of their
actual independence and regardless of whether the profits are reserved and
distributed to shareholders/participants. It is well settled law that holding
and its subsidiary are totally separate and distinct taxpayers. In the present
case, it is an undisputed fact and admitted by  193 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the Ld. AO/DRP that the NBC Universal Inc, (a leading and an
independent Group and the Joint Venture of the GE group) through its group
company, Universal Studios International BV, subscribed to new shares
amounting to USD 150 Mn (Rs. 642.54 crores) in a NDTV Group Company namely
NDTV Networks International Holdings BV (NNIH) (a company incorporated as per
the laws of Netherlands and resident of that country) on May 23, 2008. Thus,
it is most respectfully submitted that the action of the Ld. AO in making said
addition in the hands of the Appellant company (ultimate holding company) and
the action of the Hon'ble DRP in confirming said addition is devoid any merit
and has no legal basis.
27.3 In order to come over from well settled legal position of distinct and
separate entities of corporate personality, both AO and DRP had made ingenious
attempt to invoke the doctrine of lifting of corporate veil on misconceived
grounds. It well settled in legal jurisprudence that the corporate veil could
be lifted in the case of fraud or sham or any device designated to defeat the
interest of shareholders, investors and contractual parties. No doubt, the
revenue is entitled to invoke the lifting of corporate veil if the facts so
warranted, but the onus is on Revenue to establish the dominant object of the
transaction and how the said transaction resulted into evasion or avoidance of
tax. It is most respectfully submitted that the revenue on the facts of the
case failed to bring any material on record which could establish that the
transaction of subscription of shares would result in any form of tax evasion
or avoidance by the assessee company or its subsidiary. It is well settled law
that the share capital is in the nature of capital receipt and could not be
brought to tax in the hands of the recipient company. In the case of CIT vs.
Stellar Investment Ltd. reported in 192 ITR 287 (Delhi) Hon'ble Delhi High
Court has held that if the shareholders are identified and it is established
that they have invested money in the purchase of shares then the amount
received by the company would be regarded as a capital receipt. The above
decision is also approved by the Apex Court in CIT vs. Stellar Investment Ltd.
reported in 251 ITR 263(SC) and CIT vs. Lovely Exports Pvt. Ltd. reported in
319 ITR 6 (St.). Further, the above ratio is also approved by Full Bench of
Delhi High in the case of CIT vs Sophia Finance Ltd reported in 205 ITR 98
(Del)(FB).
27.4 It is submitted that the aforesaid judgment of the Apex Court has been
also followed in the following judicial pronouncements:
i) 356 ITR 65 (MP) CIT vs. Peoples General Hospital Ltd. ―It is not the case
of any of the parties that M/s Alliance Industries Limited, Sharjah is a bogus
company or a non-existent company and the amount which was subscribed by the
said Company by way of share subscription was in fact the money of the
respondent assessee. In the present case, the assessee had established the
identity of investor who had provided the share subscription and it was
established that the transaction was genuine though as per contention of the
respondent the creditworthiness of the creditor was also  194 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, established. In the present case, in the light
of the judgment of Lovely Exports (P.) Ltd.'s (supra) we have to see only in
respect of the establishment of the identity of the investor. The Delhi High
Court also in Divine Leasing & Finance Ltd.'s case (supra), considering the
similar question held that the assessee Company having received subscriptions
to the public/rights issue through banking channels and furnished complete
details of the shareholders, no addition could be made under section 68 in the
absence of any positive material or evidence to indicate that the shareholders
were benamidars or fictitious persons or that any part of the share capital
represented company's own income from undisclosed sources. The similar view
has been taken by the other High Courts.
17\. As the Apex Court has considered the law in Lovely Exports (P.) Ltd.'s
case (supra) and in view of law laid down by the Apex Court, we find that the
substantial questions framed in these appeals do not arise for our
consideration. Accordingly, all these appeals are dismissed with no order as
to costs.‖ [Emphasis supplied]\
ii) 294 ITR 661 (Mad) CIT vs. Electro Polychem Ltd.
iii) 166 Taxman 7 (All) Jaya Securities Ltd. vs. ACIT

viii) 45 taxmann.com 204 (All) CIT vs. Vacment Packaging (India) (P) Ltd It is
submitted that on the basis of the aforesaid Apex Court judgement, the Hon'ble
MP High Court has further held that the settled rule of law is that where an
investor being a foreign company (not taxable in India) makes an investment by
acquiring shares, no addition could legally be made. It has been further held
that the aforesaid judgement of the Hon'ble Apex court is binding authority
under Article 141 of the constitution of India.
27.5 In view of the above, it is submitted that it absolutely cannot be a case
of lifting the corporate veil as the transaction in question could not be
termed as fraud or sham or device designated to avoid tax liability,
especially when the assesee beyond any suspicion established and discharged
its onus to prove the identity and creditworthiness of the share subscriber
and to prove the nature and the source of the funds by way of additional
evidence filed with applications dated April 29, 2013,October 24, 2013 and
December 23, 2013 with the Hon'ble DRP. In any case, mere complex structure of
subsidiaries and the business of the assesee's subsidiaries in India would not
justify lifting of the corporate veil 27.6 In regard to reliance of the Ld.
AO/DRP on stray observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Vodafone's Case (supra), it is submitted that the complete reading of the
above decision gives an  195 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, impression
that an attempt to lift the corporate veil is available to the Revenue in
certain circumstances only if they first establish that the transaction so
entered is a device to avoid taxes by interposing the subsidiaries and hiding
the true nature of the transaction. In other words, in order to lift corporate
veil, it needs to be establish beyond doubt that the transaction in question
is taxable in the charging section of the Income Tax Act and the taxes were
avoided by the group by interposing the subsidiaries. It is further submitted
that the assumption and action of the Ld. AO/DRP of lifting the corporate veil
in respect of the foreign subsidiaries which are incorporated and governed by
the laws of their respective countries and had treaty protection is complete
defiance of the decision in the case of UOI vs. Azadi Bachao Andolan reported
in 263 ITR 706 wherein it has been held as under:
> ―The decision of the Chancery Division in F.G. Films Ltd., In re 53 (1) WLR
> 483 was pressed into service as an example of the mask of corporate entity
> being lifted and account be taken of what lies behind in order to prevent
> ‗fraud'. This decision only emphasises the doctrine of piercing the veil of
> incorporation. There is no doubt that, where necessary, the Courts are
> empowered to lift the veil of incorporation while applying the domestic law.
> In the situation where the terms of the DTAC have been made applicable by
> reason of section 90 of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, even if they derogate from
> the provisions of the Income-tax Act, it is not possible to say that this
> principle of lifting the veil of incorporation should be applied by the
> court.‖ 27.7 The DRP in its directions (pages 11-12 of Appeal Set) has
> referred to para 68 of judgment of Apex Court in the case of Vodafone
> International Holdings BV vs. UOI reported in 341 ITR 1 27.8 At the outset
> it is submitted that the aforesaid observations of the Apex Court have
> absolutely no application to the facts of the instant case. In the said
> case, the issue involved was whether the transaction of sale of shares
> outside India was a bonafide transaction and, if the answer to the question
> was affirmative, whether the assessee would be liable to tax in India in
> respect of the transfer of shares under the head ‗capital gains'.
27.9 It is submitted that the issue involved however in the instant appeal as
to whether the assessee is liable to be assessed in respect of the amount
received on issue of shares by its subsidiary to another unrelated company M/s
Universal Studios International BV, who has made investment in acquiring the
shares and has so admitted to have made investment. It is thus submitted that
the issue involved in the two cases are different.
27.10 However, without prejudice thereto, to the above submissions it was held
by the Apex Court in the said case that, if the transaction is between two
independent companies, the ‗look at' theory is to be applied instead of ‗look
through theory. It is thus submitted that look at theory had to be followed in
respect of instant transaction of investment  196 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, and acquisition of shares between independent and unrelated
legal entities. It is submitted that the efforts of the authorities to hold
the transaction to be ‗sham' is based on their appreciation which is not only
unsupported by evidence but by following the ‗look through' theory. 27.11
Further, there is no basis to lift the corporate veil. The Apex Court in the
aforesaid judgment itself, has held that the same could be done only if the
purpose of creation of NDTV Network International Holding BV was tax
avoidance. In the instant case, it is submitted that, even assuming that the
shares were acquired by Universal Studios International BV, the same cannot be
said by any sense of understanding it was with a purpose of tax avoidance. It
is submitted that the fact that shares had been acquired by Universal Studios
International BV when it paid consideration cannot be disputed. It is
submitted that Universal Studios International BV has not merely confirmed the
investment but has also established source of funding of investment thus
whether such shares were acquired of assessee company or of subsidiary cannot
be any ground to enable the revenue to lift the corporate veil.
27.12 The only basis to allege that the transaction is ‗sham' is issuance of
share at astronomical price and repurchase at a lower rate. However, in the
process, the revenue is overlooking the, same could make no difference. To
clarify the same, it is submitted that, had the shares been issued by the
appellant company instead of subsidiary, could it have made any difference in
law, since is either of the two cases, there was no tax implication much less
avoidance. Thus, the basic threshold condition being non existing the effort
of the authorities to lift the veil is totally beyond jurisdiction.
27.13 It further observed that, while doing so, the revenue/courts should keep
in mind the following factors:
                    The concept of participation investment;
                    The duration of time during which the holding structure exists;
                    The period of business operations in India;
                    The generation of taxable revenue in India;
                    The timing of the exit;
                    The continuity of business on such exit.
27.14 It thus held that, in short the onus will be on the revenue to identify
the scheme and its dominant purpose. The corporate business purpose of a
transaction is evidence of the fact that the impugned transaction is not
undertaken as a colorable or artificial device. The stronger the evidence of a
device, the stronger the corporate business purpose must exist to overcome the
evidence of a device 27.15 It is submitted that the said observations had been
made by Apex Court in the context of taxability of capital gain or business
income and not in the context of any investment when is made by an
identifiable identity. The court has held that, substance over form and
piercing the corporate veil are permissible only after it is able to establish
that impugned transaction is a ‗sham' or ‗tax avoidance'. It gave  197 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, illustrations i.e. corporation has been
structured for circular trading or round tripping or to give bribes. It is
submitted that there is no basis to allege that there is either any circular
trading or round tripping or even giving bribes.
27.16 One of the basis which led the learned DRP to hold that the transaction
is sham is based on the assumption that shares were issued by NDTV Network
International BV‖, to ―Universal Studio International BV‖ at a premium of Rs.
7,015/- per share and repurchased at Rs. 159/- per share though face value was
of RS. 45/- per share. In fact in so doing it has been overlooked that what
was acquired by the investor company was 31.4% stake is NDTV Network
International Holding BV and not merely the share as such. Further, by
acquiring 31.4% of the share in the said company, what was indirectly acquired
was 26% in M/s NDTV Networks Plc, a UK company and thus, the fact that face
value was Rs. 45/- is a wholly irrelevant factor. Be that as it may, it was a
commercial transaction and it was a prudence of the investor to determine the
value of such shares. In any case and without prejudice, the shares of USD 20
Million were issued to Fuse+Media LP, wherein they required 5% equity in the
company M/s NDTV Network Plc. Now when it had issued 26% even on that basis,
it would be USD 105 million as against investment of USD 150 million. Further,
again convertible bonds were issued for conversion into equity shares after 5
years, when 20% of the holding was to the allotted to the bond holder namely.
These bonds were issued for 100 million, and thus transaction was a genuine
transaction. In any case, it is a commercial decision and the same has no
consequence. Further, it is submitted that, when the shareholder who had
acquired the share felt that, it is commercially unviable for it to remain
invested it sold the same and as such so far raising of capital is concerned,
the same is an irrelevant consideration. 28 Without prejudice to the
allegation that M/s NDTV Networks International Holdings BV being a group
company came into existence for a short period and did not carry on any
business as alleged, the same by itself is not any ground or, basis to hold
that the transaction of the subscription of shares by M/s Universal Studios
International BV, is a sham transaction. It is submitted from the submissions
made above, it is apparent that M/s Universal Studios International BV, the
shareholder was a subsidiary of NBC Universal Inc. and was group company of GE
Group one of the largest company in the world. Thus where the funds have come
through banking channels from an well- established entity, the assumption and
presumption of the authorities that the transaction is sham and the amount
received by the subsidiary of the assessee was the assessee's own money is a
matter which cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny. It has been not shown
that either no funds came or it was the assessee's own funds by leading
positive material. The conclusion is based on frivolous, unsubstantiated
allegation that, it was assessee's own money. 28.1 It is submitted that the
basis on which A.O. has proceeded to make addition u/s 69A of the Income Tax
Act is that, investment is not  198 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, recorded
in the books of accounts; whereas it has been held by the authorities that the
investment is duly recorded in the books of the assessee's subsidiary M/s NDTV
Networks International Holdings BV and therefore by no logic it could be held
that provisions of section 69A of the Act are applicable. It is added here
that the learned DRP in its order has held that the addition is to be made u/s
69A of the Act. It has also held that, addition is to be made u/s 68 of the
Act. This finding itself shows contradiction in terms. Even assuming for an
argument that section 68 of the Act has been invoked, and has been invoked
then the fact remains that there is a credit in the books of the assessee
subsidiary, the source of which is well established that the funds have been
received through banking channel and has been confirmed by the shareholder who
had acquired the shares 28.2 It is submitted that the learned Assessing
Officer could not have proceeded to draw unilateral opinion without even
either calling upon the assessee itself or having examined the investors by
making or independent enquiry to hold that the source is not explained or
transaction is sham. It is submitted, that in the course of proceedings before
the learned Assessing Officer no effort has been made by the revenue to call
upon the assessee to produce the investor shareholder to satisfy the
commercial or business prudency of the investor who make investment by
acquiring shares at high premium. It is neither rule of law nor a rule of
prudence that merely because a person seeks to make investment by acquiring
assets at a higher premium holds the transaction to be sham, unless and until,
the same is demonstrated by the tangible evidence. It is the alleger who has
to establish the fact by leading positive evidence in support of his
allegation that, apparent is real unless proved to be contrary. In the instant
case, apparent is that there is a company incorporated under the laws of
Netherlands and that it had made investment in assessee's subsidiary and had
made the payment through its accounts which is duly reflected in its final
account and that it has been further confirmed by it and also its holding
company as also reflected such investment in their final balance sheet. 28.3
It is submitted that the charging of premium on fresh issue of shares is based
on the business potential of the group which mainly consists of the
entertainment vertical of the business. It is settled in law that the share
premium received on the issue of shares has to be included in the paid up
capital irrespective of whether the share premium has been maintained in a
separate account apart from the reserve as held in the case of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs Allahabad Bank Ltd. reported in 73 ITR
745. Drawing support from this decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is
submitted share premium being a capital receipt; the same cannot be taxed as a
revenue receipt under section 68/69A of the Act. A detailed note on the
formation of subsidiaries, their activities and the basis of valuation of USD
150 Mn. is separately enclosed as Annexure 2 of this Synopsis, though it is
specific averment of the appellant that it would not be material in order to
invoke the provisions of section 68 or 69A of the Act.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 28.4 It is submitted the other factor which
has made basis by the revenue is that, such shares were offloaded by the said
company at a lower premium is also misconceived, as would be evident from
Annexure 2 to this Synopsis.
28.5 It is submitted that in the judgment of the High Court in the case of CIT
vs. Divine Leasing & Finance Ltd. reported in 299 ITR 268 (Del) which has been
upheld by the Apex Court in the case of CIT vs. Lovely Exports Pvt. Ltd.
reported in 319 ITR 5 (ST), it was held that where there was an investment by
way of share capital, no addition can be made in the hands of investee
company. The only requirement is to establish the identification of the
shareholder. In this case, it is submitted there is no whisper or suggestion
that, assessee had failed to establish the existence of the said company. On
the contrary, it is an admitted fact that the said company exists and was a
group company of NBCU, which is one of the largest media entertainment company
and is a part of GE company. There is no allegation by any of the companies
that, they did not make investment. The question that whether they made
investment at a higher value or at a lower value is wholly irrelevant and an
extraneous consideration. The observation was made that the appellant has
failed to establish the price of the shares which is 159 times of the face
value. The appellant had placed on record necessary evidence to establish that
the value of the share of the appellant company was 138 times, which was
stated in the stock exchange. This submission has been made because the
revenue has made an attempt to lift the veil of the corporate entity and if it
be so, then obviously it is the value of the share of the said company that
has to be considered.
28.6 In any case and without prejudice, what was the value of the share of the
said company and at what rate the shareholder company acquired the share is
totally irrelevant consideration and cannot be made any ground whatsoever to
hold that, it is an unaccounted income of the assessee so as to invoke section
69A of the Act, which had absolutely no application.
28.7 On the facts of the present case, it is an admitted and undisputed fact
that the transaction in question is subscription of the share capital in a
foreign subsidiary of the assesee company by the Investor which in the normal
charging provisions of the Act is not chargeable to tax. Thus, there is no
basis to lift the corporate veil. It is further submitted that the addition in
the present case was sustained by invoking the provisions of section 68 and
69A of the Act which in itself are complete and deeming provisions, therefore,
the ingredients of said sections need to be construed strictly, and there is
no scope to bring the fiction and assumption of lifting a corporate veil to
hold the holding company liable to be taxed in that sections. In other words
and without admitting, it is submitted that no addition could be made in the
hands of assessee company being a holding company of the company whose share
capital was introduced under section 68 or 69A of the Act in the grab of
lifting of corporate veil.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 29 The assessee further submits that in the
report of the learned Assessing Officer as has been extracted at page 140 it
has been alleged that the transactions ―involves round tripping‖. 29.1 It is
not known on what basis it has been alleged that, ―it involves round
tripping‖. Further, it has stated that there are huge variations in the rates,
which it is submitted is of no consequence at all.The appellant seeks to place
reliance on the following judgments:
i) 350 ITR 220 (All) CIT vs. Jay Dee Securities and Finance Ltd.
ii) 91 DTR 217 (All) CIT vs. Misra Preservers (P) Ltd. 29.2 At this juncture,
the appellant submits the finding of the learned Assessing Officer in the
remand report was that the transactions involved round tripping (page 140 of
the Appeal Set). However, the learned DRP finding that such an observation is
unsubstantiated has held in its direction (page 146 of the Appeal Set) that
―though the assessee has sought to explain the above amount through the
lengthy and circuitous transactions, the commercial substance/economic
rationale for such transaction has not been satisfactorily explained. 29.3 The
appellant most respectfully submits that the aforesaid observations of the
learned DRP are not merely flimsy and vague but are in disregard of the fact
that explanation tendered could not be by any stretch of logic or imagination
or the transaction was circuitous or otherwise lacking commercial
substance/economic rationale. On the contrary, the appellant company had
established that such a transaction of issue of shares by its subsidiary was a
genuine transaction. It was submitted that M/s. Universal Studios
International BV, an independent company incorporated in Netherlands had under
a shareholder agreement acquired 26% stake in NDTV PLC UK at an aggregate
consideration. It is respectfully submitted that the learned DRP has
completely ignored and overlooked the fact that the assessee company or its
subsidiary had no role to play and the decision of investment was of an
independent company. The learned DRP has failed to appreciate that the said
company is subsidiary of GE group, one of the largest companies of the world.
It is thus submitted that the finding of the learned DRP that assessee had
sought to explain the share capital receipt of Rs. 642.54 crores through
lengthy and circuitous transactions and commercial substance/economic
rationale for which have not been satisfactorily explained lacks credence or
any merit.
29.4 It is submitted that there is no basis to allege that explanation was
either lengthy or transactions were circuitous. It is submitted that in what
manner, the explanation was either lengthy or the transactions was circuitous
lies only in one's imagination. No basis or any material has been led by the
learned DRP to conclude and hold that explanation of the assessee in respect
of the share capital received by its subsidiary from a global company was
lengthy and furthermore, such a transaction was circuitous transaction. In
such circumstances, the opinion of the learned DRP is based on hypothetical
assumptions, theoretical considerations and imaginative suppositions and hence
in  201 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the respectful submission of
the appellant, absolutely and entirely arbitrary, unjustified and untenable.
29.5 It is further submitted that the observation of the learned DRP that
appellant has not been able to satisfactorily explain the commercial substance
and rational for such transactions, is also misconceived, misplaced and
overlooks the factual matrix. It is submitted that there is no basis to hold
that there was either no commercial substance or economic rationale for such
transactions. It is not known on what basis, the learned DRP has proceeded to
allege and assume that either the commercial substance or economic rationale
for transactions has not been satisfactorily explained by the appellant. The
directions of the learned DRP are highly vague and unsubstantiated. It was for
the learned DRP to establish and not allege on subjective suppositions that
the transaction lacks commercial substance or economic rationale. The learned
DRP has failed to comprehend that there is exists, no material to arrive at
such a finding or conclusion. Infact, there had been no examination of the
parent company or investor company or even books of accounts to suggest that
explanation of the appellant overlooks commercial substance. On the contrary,
the assessee received valid consideration after due negotiation when it issued
shares to the investor company. It is a matter of record that such issue of
shares was based on valuations, which had been accepted by other investors and
are not in dispute in the instant appeal and thus, the entire approach of the
learned DRP to direct the learned Assessing Officer to make the addition is
based on unsound principles and complete misconception of facts and
circumstances of the case of the appellant company.
29.6 Further, even the observation that economic rationale has not been
explained is also vague but is contrary to fact that the assessee has received
an amount which is not an astronomical price. It is submitted that face value
of Rs. 45/- is the face value of the investee company namely M/s. NDTV
Networks International Holding and is an irrelevant consideration. It is
submitted that the investment was made by the investor namely M/s. Universal
Studio International VV to acquire 26% indirect stake in M/s. NDTV Networks
PLC UK. It is submitted that valuation of Rs. 7115/- per share is not an
astronomical price as entire 26% stake had been subscribed by the investor
company by making an investment to the tune of 150 million US Dollar which
gives an enterprise valuation of 500 million US Dollar. It is submitted and as
stated above, this enterprise valuation is supported by preceding investments
made in NDTV Networks PLC UK in the preceding years whereby 5% stake had been
allotted to an independent investor for a sum of 20 million US Dollar giving
an enterprise value of 400 million US Dollar. Later, preference shares had
also been allotted for 100 million US Dollar by NDTV Networks PLC UK. It is
thus submitted that observation of the learned DRP overlooks the fundamental
facts and proceeds on surmiseful assumptions to direct the learned Assessing
Officer to make an addition on willy nilly basis and mere ipsi dixit which
202 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, is not a valid basis to make an
addition 30 It is submitted that the conclusion that transaction lacks
economic substance and commercial purpose is a matter of mere figment of
imagination as the learned Assessing Officer of the assessee company cannot
hold that it lacks economic substance or commercial purpose without even
calling upon the investor, who had made investment to hold so.
30.1 It is submitted that while subscribing to the shares in the subsidiary,
the investor/capital contributor namely (USBV) had agreed to the business plan
which is the part of the shareholder agreement dated May 23, 2008\. The
amounts so received on subscription of capital were utilized in accordance
with said plan, and there is no dispute on the same and had been confirmed by
the investor in writing. Therefore, the allegation that the amount so received
consists of premium would be misconceived and devoid of any merit and is
merely based on suspicion and conjectures which could not be any basis for
making an addition.
30.2 Be that it may so, it is well settled in the business world that the
share premium is to be decided by the Board of Directors and there is no
prohibition under the law so far as the amount of premium is concerned which a
company could charge from its subscribers. It is well within the right of the
issuer and subscriber to negotiate the price for the contribution of capital
and the manner in which it had to be classified. The said fact has also been
accepted by the Ld. AO in his remand report at Para No. 2.3.11.1. Thus, the
issue whether the shares could be issued on premium or not cannot be a test to
determine the characterization of the transaction in the present case. 30.3 To
support that the issuance of share premium without having valuation done have
no consequence, the Applicant placed its reliance on the ruling of the Mumbai
Tribunal in the case of M/s. Green Infra Ltd vs ITO reported n 159 TTJ 728
wherein the newly incorporated company issued shares of Rs. 10 at share
premium of Rs. 490, though it had yet to start its business. The relevant
extracts of the above case are as under:-
> ―....During the course of the assessment proceedings, the AO sought details
> and information u/s. 133(6) of the Act from the subscribers to the share
> capital and share premium account. The necessary details and explanations
> were received and were duly placed on record. After considering the entire
> submissions and the documents filed by the assessee in response to the
> specific queries raised by the AO, the AO was of the firm belief that the
> premium charged on allotment of shares is not justified. The AO was of the
> opinion that these funds were introduced by the assessee through share
> holders under the guise of the premium. The AO further observed that the
> company had a paid up share capital of Rs. 5,00,000/- on the date of
> incorporation. The certificate of registration issued by the  203 ITA No.
> 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New

> was prepared and submitted to the subscribers on 14.4.2008. There are no
> reserves and surplus as on these dates available with the company. The Book
> value per share of the company is at Rs. 10/- per share could not justify
> charging of any premium on shares.
The AO further observed that the assessee does not have any hidden assets in
the form of patents, copy rights, intellectual property rights or even
investments etc belonging to the company based on which the assessee would be
likely to substantially enhance its profits, which may have a bearing on the
premium to be charged on allotment of the fresh shares In the above facts, the
Hon'ble Tribunal has held as under:-
> ―....No doubt a non-est company or a zero balance company asking for a share
> premium of Rs. 490/- per share defies all commercial prudence but at the
> same time we cannot ignore the fact that it is a prerogative of the Board of
> Directors of a company to decide the premium amount and it is the wisdom of
> the share holders whether they want to subscribe to such a heavy premium.
The Revenue authorities cannot question the charging of such of huge premium
without any bar from any legislated law of the land. Details of subscribers
were before the Revenue authorities.....‖ Reliance is also placed on the
judgment of Jurisdictional High Court in case of CIT vs. Empire Buildtech (P)
Ltd. reported in 43 taxmann.com 269 has held as under:
> ―3. The facts in brief are that the assessee filed its income tax return for
> the year 2006-07. It is a matter of record that the assessee was
> incorporated on 20.10.2005 and commenced business thereafter.
The assessee had reported receipt of share capital to the tune of Rs. 11
lakhs; it sold them at 1000% premium and claimed to have received Rs. 1.1
crores on that count. During the enquiry made at the time of assessment
proceedings, the AO required the assessee to furnish various particulars which
have been set out in pages 21-23 of the paper book and contained in about 10
columns. He also proceeded to make further enquiry to that end and issued
notices under Section 133 (6) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the individuals
and entities who had applied as shareholders directly. This yielded certain
information. 28 of the 39 investors responded to  204 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the queries. Out of the balance of 11, 2 of them did not receive
the notice and 9 received the notices and apparently had responded. Based on
the materials on record, the AO framed the assessment adding the entire amount
under Section 68. The assessee claiming to be aggrieved approached the
Commissioner (Appeals) and successfully argued that once the identity of the
investors had been disclosed, it had discharged the burden imposed upon it by
law and that the amount could not be added back under Section 68. The
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) directed the deletion of Rs. 1.10 crores
holding that since these individuals had responded and furnished the
particulars elicited, the AO should not have added the amount as income.
Almost similar approach was adopted in respect of the other 11 investors on
the reasoning that the assessee did all that was required of it under the law
by disclosing the identity of investors. The ITAT confirmed the order of the
CIT (A). The Revenue, therefore, is in appeal before us.
7\. In Lovely Exports (supra), the Supreme Court emphasized that the initial
burden is upon the assessee to show as to the genuineness of the identity of
the individuals or entities which seek to subscribe to the share capital. Once
the relevant facts are furnished, the onus, stated the Supreme Court, shifts
to the Revenue. In the present case, what this Court is to determine,
therefore, is whether the burden had been fully discharged and whether the AO
recorded its conclusion on the basis of the material on record. The AO in its
order has produced the tabular statement describing the number of shares
subscribed by the investors, the amounts paid by them, the individuals who
paid the amount towards such capital and the gross income reported by each of
such investors to the Revenue. A look at that chart - the contents of which
have nowhere been disputed - would show that the investors had by and large
reported amounts far less as compared to the sums invested by them, towards
share capital.
Furthermore, the AO had during the course of the assessment issued notices
under Section 133 (6) to the investors - 28 of them responded; 2 did not
receive the notice and 9 of them received the notices and responded, but did
not submit any confirmation. While entertaining this appeal on 12.11.2013, the
Court had issued notice restricting to the addition of Rs.
31,94,000/-, i.e., so far as it pertained to 11 subscribers/investors whose
particulars could not be  205 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, verified and
who did not respond to the notices issued by the AO.
8\. Having regard to the circumstances, particularly, the fact that these
investors not only did not submit any confirmation and had concededly reported
far less income than the amounts invested, this Court is of the opinion that
the assessee could not under the circumstances be said to have discharged the
burden which was upon it in the first instance in view of the law declared in
Lovely Exports (supra) matter. It is not sufficient for the assessee to merely
disclose the addresses or identities of the individuals concerned. The other
way of looking at the matter is that having given the addresses, the inability
of the noticees who are approached by the AO to afford any reasonable
explanation as to how they got the amounts given the nature of their income
which was disproportionally less than what they subscribed as share capital
would also amount to the Revenue having discharged the onus if at all which
fell upon it. This Court also notices that the assessee in this case was
incorporated barely few months before the commencement of the assessment year,
and there is no further information, or anything to indicate why its mark up
of the share premium thousand folds in respect of the shares which were of the
face value of Rs. 10 lakhs was justified.
9\. In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the
Revenue's appeal has to be partly allowed.
10\. The impugned order is accordingly set aside to the extent it deleted the
addition of Rs. 31,94,000/-. The said amount is directed to be restored and
added back to the assessee's income under Section 68.
11\. The appeal is partly allowed to the above extent.‖ The said judgment
support the submission of the appellant where a shareholder confirms the
investment made in acquisition of shares despite the fact that shares were
issued on premium, no addition is sustainable. However, it held that, the
addition wherein shareholders did not confirm acquisition of shares then the
circumstances that shares were issued at premium was regarded as a an addition
basis to sustain the addition.
30.4 Thus, it would be incorrect to allege that NNIH could not charge a
premium especially when it had already made huge investments at the beginning
of the year in its subsidiary who holds the operating subsidiaries companies.
30.5 Your Honours attention is also drawn to the amendment made by the Finance
Act, 2012, wherein the legislature had inserted section  206 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 56(2)(vii)(b) of the Act, wherein they have
intended to tax the amount of share premium received in excess of the Fair
Market Value of the shares as ―Income from Other Sources‖. The said provision
(as amended) is not applicable to the Applicant Company as NDTV is a company
in which public is substantially interested. Therefore, no adverse inference
could have been drawn in the facts of the present case in respect of charging
premium. It is also important to note that the said provision is not
applicable in the case of the investor being a foreign company investing in
share capital of an Indian company at a premium. Further, it is a fact that
both investor and investee companies are non-resident companiesand the
provisions of the domestic law would have no application whatsoever.
30.6 Secondly, both AO/DRP had alleged that subsequently in a short period of
time said share capital was repurchased at a much lesser price which resulted
into capital loss in the hands of the investor (USBV) which rendered entire
transaction sham as it had no commercial and economic substance. It is
submitted that the said allegation is completely misconceived and devoid of
any merits on account of the following reasons:
i) The subsequent event of repurchase would not be material to determine the
nature of the original transaction specially when the provisions of section 68
and 69A of the Act were invoked. On the contrary, the reliance on the same
proved that original transaction of subscription of shares is beyond any
suspicion and ingredients of section 68 and 69A of the Act to tax the original
transaction do not survive. In other words, the fact that the investments were
repurchased subsequently shows that the original transaction is neither a
tainted or illegal which warranted the lifting of corporate veil or would be
held ‗cash credits' under section 68 of the Act or ‗unexplained money' under
section 69A of the Act in the hands of the assessee company.
ii) As far as the losses in the hands of the investor (USBV) on account of
subsequent repurchase is concerned, the same is also irrelevant as it is not
the case of the Revenue that such losses have benefited the assesee or its
group companies in any manner. On the contrary, presuming but not admitting
that the losses so incurred by the investor (USBV) are not genuine in that
case also the appropriate recourse would be non allowance of such losses, if
it is claimed in the hands of the investor (USBV) and in no manner could make
the ―good money‖ as ―bad money‖ received on subscription of shares under
section 68 or 69A of the Act in the hands of assessee or its group companies.
30.7 Having said so, the decision of USBV/NBCU to exit from the company M/s
NNIH was based on the fact that entertainment business in India was based on
the reasons that the business of NDTV Imagine Group has suffered huge losses
and to revive the same the fresh equity infusion was required. It is a fact
that the entire business of NDTV Imagine Group was later on sold by NNPLC at a
total consideration of  207 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, USD
7,34,85,427 to Turner Asia Pacific Ventures after due negotiation which
included consideration to be paid to minority stakeholder amounting to USD
66,73,551 . The disclosure to that effect was also made (below the note on re-
purchase of stake from USBV) in the Annual Report of the Group for FY 2009-10
which read as under:-
> ―...The Company and NDTV Networks Plc, on 8 December 2009, entered into an
> agreement with Turner Asia Pacific Ventures, Inc. ("TAPV") for the sale of

30.9 In view of the above, it is submitted that the addition was merely based
on surmises and conjectures which is impermissible and in complete disregard
to the facts of the case. It is further submitted that the revenue on
subjective opinion which is based on surmises and conjectures applied the
doctrine of lifting of corporate veil and therefore, the addition deserves to
be deleted in the hands of hands of the assesee company on this ground alone
in view of the following decisions:
i) 26 ITR 775 (SC) Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. vs. CIT ―As regards the second
contention, we are in entire agreement with the learned Solicitor-General when
he says that the Income- tax Officer is not fettered by technical rules of
evidence and pleadings, and that he is entitled to act on material which may
not be accepted as evidence in a court of law, but there the agreement ends;
because it is equally clear that in making the  208 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessment under sub-section (3) of Section 23 of the Act, the
Income-tax Officer is not entitled to make a pure guess and make an assessment
without reference to any evidence or any material at all. There must be
something more than bare suspicion to support the assessment under Section
23(3).‖
ii) 37 ITR 271 (SC) Umacharan Shaw & Bros. vs. CIT ―...Taking into
consideration the entire circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that
there was no material on which the Income-tax Officer could come to the
conclusion that the firm was not genuine. There are many surmises and
conjectures, and the conclusion is the result of suspicion which cannot take
the place of proof in these matters.‖ 31 The assessee also seeks to refer to
page 12 (Directions of DRP), wherein in para 5.12, the DRP has recorded its
finding and has stated that the duration of time during which the holding
structure exists: the period of business operations in India; the generation
of taxable revenues in India, the timing of the exit; the continuity of
business on such exit‖ is a relevant consideration.
31.1 The aforesaid observations were in the context of determination of
capital gain and not for the purpose of business profit and had nothing to do
with the issue related to the instant case. It is submitted that, no such
additions has either been proposed by the A.O. nor has even been directed to
be made by the learned DRP.
31.2 Further the appellant also does not dispute the proposition of law that
while computing assessee's income what is taxable in law is the entire income
earned anywhere in India and in fact such is not a issue. The issue involved
is limited and i.e. whether the amount received by way of share subscription
by the assessee subsidiary in Netherland could be regarded as assessee's
income u/s 69A of the Act, despite the fact as stated above.
32 It is submitted that, there can be no opinion other than what has been held
by Apex Court in the case of CIT vs. Lovely Exports Pvt. Ltd. reported in 319
ITR 5 (St) that where an assessee identifies the shareholder he discharges his
obligation. In this case no shares were issued by the assessee and shares
issued by the assessee's subsidiary which were duly identified by the
subsidiary to have been contributed by the shareholder, who not only existed
but has substantial financial background.
33 In such circumstances, the submission of the appellant is that the
following findings of the authorities:
           i)      That ―transaction‖ is sham;
           ii)     That corporate veil is to be lifted;
           iii)    That share capital received is assessee's own money;
           iv)     That no investment has been made by the investor i.e. M/s
Universal Studios International BV, is totally untenable in law and is based
on flimsy consideration.
33.1 Having said so, the applicant further submits as under to state the
correct facts and affairs of its subsidiaries which have not been  209 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, considered and appreciated by the Ld. AO/DRP
which shows that the transaction in question is genuine and provisions of
section 68 or 69A of the Act are not applicable on the facts of the case and
no addition could be made in the hands of assessee company by invoking these
sections.
i) That the Company had complied with all Accounting Standards in accordance
with provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 while preparing the accounts for
the year under consideration and the Ld. AO is factually and legally incorrect
in alleging that there is non-compliance of Accounting Standards.
ii) That the Company had disclosed the true nature of above transaction in its
consolidated books of accounts / financial statements which is clearly evident
from the disclosures made in the notes of accounts and had even explained the
objective and rationale of the said transaction in the Annual Report for the
year under consideration. Therefore, the Ld. AO is factually incorrect and
wrong in stating that the applicant had failed to disclose the true nature of
the above transaction.
iii) The AO had alleged that the applicant company failed to prove the
identity and creditworthiness of the share subscriber and also failed to
satisfactorily prove the nature and the source of the funds. In respect of the
above allegations, though the applicant had discharged its primary onus to
prove the identity and creditworthiness of the share subscriber and to prove
the nature and the source of the funds, yet in order to substantiate the above
filed additional evidences vide its letters dated April 29, 2013October 24,
2013 and December 23, 2013 with the Hon'ble DRP and and the same were
forwarded to the Ld. AO in the course of the remand proceedings. The applicant
adduced the evidences tabulated above in its various applications which the
Hon'ble DRP and learned AO failed to appreciate the same in accordance with
law.
33.2 The aforesaid evidences filed clearly substantiate that transaction in
question is genuine and done in accordance with law and could not be alleged
or rejected on mere suspicion and vague allegations. The assessee most
respectfully submits that said evidences and explanations could not be
rejected by merely stating that evidences have no evidentiary value in light
of the suspicious, imaginary and irrelevant grounds, especially when the
evidences and explanations of the assessee shows and prove beyond doubt that
the receipt in the hands of NNIH is not of a nature of an income. It is a
settled principle in law that the Revenue could not ―convert good proof‖ into
―no proof‖ or otherwise act unreasonably and arbitrary which it seemed to have
acted without commenting and stating the specific reasons and grounds that why
such evidences have no evidentiary value. The Applicant fervently believes
that the evidences so filed is good enough proof to support that the
transaction is genuine and driven with objective of business needs, and there
is no reason whatsoever to cast doubts on imaginary, vague and misconceived
facts.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 33.3 It is also submitted that under law
the burden of proof is on Assessee to prove the genuineness of the
transaction, however, the review of the judicial dicta on this issue reveals
that the initial burden is upon the assessee to explain the nature and source
of the share application money received by the assessee, and once it has been
discharged the onus on revenue to prove that the same is not correct or false.
In the event, the revenue fails to discharge such onus in the absence of any
cogent material on record or any evidences, the explanation and evidences
adduced by the assessee ought to accepted, and no adverse inference could be
drawn.
In order to discharge this burden, the assessee is required to prove:
           i)       Identity of shareholder;
           ii)      Credit worthiness of shareholders.; and
           iii)     Genuineness of transaction
    34     Apart from the above the applicant submits that invoking of provisions
of section 68 and 69A of the Act on the same amount, itself shows complete non
application of mind by the Ld. AO/DRP. The applicant is saying so as the
provisions of section 68 and 69A of the Act are parallel to each other, and
basic ingredients of these two sections are opposite to each other as stated
below:
Section 68 of the Act Section 69A of the Act Conditions for applicability of
Conditions for applicability section 68 of the Act:- of section 68 of the
Act:-
                          The existence of the              assessee is found
                           books maintained by the            to be owner of any

                                                              jewellery or other
                          A credit entry in the              valuable    article;
                           books of account                   and
                                                             Such         money,
                                                              bullion, jewellery or
                                                              valuable     articleis
                                                              not recorded in the
                                                              books of account, if
                                                              any, maintained by
                                                              the assessee for
                                                              any     source      of
                                                              income
34.1 From the above highlighted portion above, it is clear that if the there
is a credit entry in the books of accounts which is not satisfactorily
explained that would be covered in section 68 of the Act. On the other hand,
if the person is found to be the owner of any money, bullion, jewellery or
other valuable article which is not recorded in the books of accounts, in that
case the provisions of section 69A of the Act is  211 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, applicable. Thus, it is submitted that the provisions of section
68 and 69A of the Act run opposite to each other, and therefore, the addition,
if any (though not admitted) could be made in either of the sections and not
in both. It is also submitted that once the assesee proved the genuineness of
the transaction within the parameters of section 68 of the Act, then no
addition could be made for the same amount under section 69A of the Act as the
basic ingredients of section 69A of the Act that said money, bullion,
jewellery or other valuable article is not recorded in the books of accounts
would not be satisfied because of the overriding finding that it is recorded
in the books of accounts of the assessee.
34.2 Be that it may so, the applicant submits that the provisions of section
69A of the Act could not be invoked in the present case in addition to what
has already been submitted above.
34.3 It is further submitted and reiterated that the ingredients of section
69A of the Act are not present in the facts of the case and the addition is
not legally sustainable on this ground in view of the submission made here-
in-below:
The Applicant submits that the deeming part of section 69A of the Act, dealing
with unexplained money etc. comes into play only if the following two
conditions are fulfilled:
1) The assessee is found to be owner of any money, bullion, jewellery or other
valuable article; and
2) Such money, bullion, jewellery or valuable article is not recorded in the
books of account, if any, maintained by the assessee for any source of income.
34.4 The applicant most respectfully submits that both the ingredients i.e.
the assessee is the owner of money and such money not been recorded in the
books of the assessee are not fulfilled in the present case.
34.5 It is well settled law that the deeming provisions need to be construed
strictly, and there is no room for construction of the said provisions on the
basis of fiction, assumption or surmises by alleging that since assessee was
an ultimate parent company, therefore, the assessee company was in ultimate
control of the said money.
34.6 In this regard, it is submitted that in the impugned assessment order as
well as on the basis of the material on record it had been admitted and is an
undisputed fact that the amount in question was the money received by the
subsidiary of the Applicant company who would be treated as the owner of such
money.
34.7 In addition to above, the acceptance of the Ld. DRP/AO in their
respective orders that the share capital was subsequently re-purchased by the
another subsidiary assessee of company from the erstwhile investor later on
also shows and support that at no point of time the assesee or its any
subsidiary was the owner of the said share capital. On the contrary, it is
proven by the material on record and admission by the Ld. AO/DRP that
investment was made by the group company of General Electric namely USBV,
thus, leaving no doubt that provisions of  212 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, section 69A of the Act could not be invoked in the facts of the
case. 34.8 A company is a separate legal person and the fact that all its
shares are owned by one person or by its parent company has nothing to do with
its separate legal existence. If the owned company is wound up, the
liquidator, and not the parent company, would get hold of the assets of the
subsidiary and the assets of the subsidiary would in no circumstance be held
to be those of the parent. Even though a subsidiary company may normally
comply with the request of the parent company, it is not a mere puppet of the
parent. The distinction is between having power and having a persuasive
position. Thus, the inferences drawn by the Ld. AO/DRP on surmises and
conjectures in this regard are not correct in light of the well settled
jurisprudence and principles settled by the various courts which are
summarised here-in- below:-
            i)       AIR 1951 SC 41 Charanjit Lal Chowdhury vs. UOI
            ii)      AIR 1955 SC 74 Bacha F. Guzdar vs. CIT
            iii)     131 ITR 445 (MP) Maharani Ushadevi vs. CIT
            iv)         AIR 1982 SC 697 Western Coalfields Ltd vs. Special Area
            Development Authority
            v)       AIR 1988 SC 1370 LIC of India vs. Escorts Ltd.
The Hon'ble Court's had summarised the position of law in this regard as
under:-
i) A shareholder's interest in a company is represented by his shareholding,
which is immovable property with all the attributes thereof.
ii) A company as a juristic person is distinct from its shareholders. It is
the company which owns the property, not the shareholders.
iii) The rights of shareholders are such as are delineated under the
provisions of the Companies Act. A shareholder while having no rights of
ownership in the assets of the company has a voice in administering the
affairs of the company and would be entitled, as provided by the Articles of
Association, to dividends, distribution out of the profits of the company.
34.9 The above principles find resonance in several other decisions including
RC Cooper vs. Union of India reported in ((1970) 2 SCC 298 (the Bank
nationalization case) where the Court reiterated the principle that a company
registered under the Companies Act is a legal person, separate and distinct
from its individual members; its property is not the property of the
shareholders who have merely an interest in the company arising under the
Articles of Association, measured by a sum of money for the purpose of
liability and for sharing the profit; and that where companies are
incorporated for a lawful purpose their properties are owned by them and there
is no reason for even taxation purposes that their property should be treated
as belonging to the shareholders. 34.10 34.10 The above proposition of law has
been accepted and approved in Vodafone's case parent company is involved in
giving principal guidance to group companies by providing general policy
guidelines to group subsidiaries. However, the fact that a parent company
exercises  213 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, shareholder's influence
on its subsidiaries does not generally imply that the subsidiaries are to be
deemed residents of the State in which the parent company resides. In other
words, the Supreme Court recognises the separate existence of the holding
company and its subsidiary companies for tax purposes.
34.11 The second condition which needs to be satisfied cumulatively with the
first condition is ―the said money has not been recorded in the books of
account of the assessee‖. It is a fact that the money in question is duly
recorded in the books of NNIH, therefore, this condition is also not satisfied
in the present case. Therefore, the provisions of section 69A of the Act have
no application in the present case.
34.12 The applicant further submits that the intention of the legislature
behind section 69A of the Act is to tax the money not recorded in the books of
accounts of the assessee though the assessee is the owner of such money. Such
provisions would normally get invoked in cases where in the assessee is found
to be owner of money and valuable article which he failed to record in its
books. However, it could not be invoked in a situation where the money has
been duly reported and had been recorded in the correct books of accounts
which in fact had been admitted by the revenue when they invoked the
provisions of section 68 of the Act as stated above.
34.13 Thus, it is submitted that the deeming fiction of 69A of the Act that
the person is an owner of said unexplained money could not be invoked in the
facts of the present case. Similarly, the question of not recording the above
transaction in the books of the Applicant company would not arise at all and
on the contrary it is submitted with full conviction, that the transaction is
genuine and a bonafide transaction and had duly been recorded in the books of
NNIH. Therefore, there is no question that the said money be treated as
unexplained money in the hands of the assessee under section 69A of the Act.
34.14 The applicant most respectfully further submits that the Applicant had
duly discharged its onus as required under the law. Further, it is well
settled law that mere allegations that the transaction in question is sham on
surmises and conjectures would be not be justified in the eyes of law. The
Applicant had explained the transaction in question in a detailed manner and
had also filed the confirmation letter of USBV as additional evidences which
is already placed on record wherein the buyers identity, creditworthiness and
source of making an investment is confirmed and authenticated and also
corroborated by the Financial Statements of USBV and NBCU.
34.15 In light of the confirmation received from the party who had invested in
NNIH, its identity and credit worthiness had been duly established.
Accordingly, we submit that the assertions of the Ld. AO that the documents do
not have any evidentiary value is not correct in law and is totally devoid of
any merit as it is well settled law that mere suspicion on the transaction
could not be a basis of making an addition. In support of the above, the
applicant company placed its reliance in the case of Dhakeswari Cotton Mills
Ltd. v. CIT reported in 26 ITR 775  214 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(SC)andUmacharan Shaw & Bros. v CIT reported in 37 ITR 271. 34.16 For your
Honours ready reference, the Applicant here-in-below again explains the nature
and source of said money in order to appreciate the facts here-in-again to
make the case of the applicant beyond suspicion and doubt:
34.17 During the year, NDTV as a Group entered into a strategic long term
partnership with NBC Universal, Inc. (NBCU) for NDTV's Networks business. The
Group has raised US$ 150 million from NBCU for an effective stake of 26% in
NDTV Networks Plc. The NDTV - NBCU strategic partnership was a coming together
of two leading professional organizations with similar ethics and goals with a
promise to be a major force in the media scene in India and beyond.
34.18 NBCU as a strategic partner infused the fresh capital on issuance of new
shares. Thus, it is evident that nature of the said transaction is infusion of
the share capital which is evident and supported by the Share Subscription and
Shareholder Agreement dated May 23, 2008. The legal sanctity of the said
documents could not be displaced on surmises and conjectures as alleged in the
impugned assessment order.
34.19 In respect of the identity of NBCU and USBV, it has already been
submitted that NBCU, now a part of Comcast Corporation (GE Venture), is one of
the world's leading media and entertainment companies in the development,
production, and marketing of entertainment, news, and information to a global
audience. NBC Universal owns and operates a valuable portfolio of news and
entertainment television networks, a premier motion picture company,
significant television production operations, a leading television stations
group, world-renowned theme parks, and a suite of leading Internet- based
businesses.
34.20 In so far as even the credit worthiness of the investor could not have
been suspected since the revenues from operations of past calendar years alone
far exceeded the amount of contribution made by way of share capital of USD
150 million. It may be stated that the revenues for the preceding calendar
years as evident from the balance sheet are as under.
                                 Calendar Year                Revenue (Millions
                                                                   USD)
                                     2007                           1676
                                     2008                           2062
Similarly, the investor in the above two years holds the Tangible and
Financial Assets investments in various companies as under:-

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Infact, even as a group of the shareholder
(NBCU) the revenues from operations of past three calendar years are as under.
                              Calendar Year               Revenue (In USD, in
                                                                 millions)
                                   2008                           16802
                                   2009                           15085
                                   2010                           16590
34.21 Thus, it is submitted with full conviction that the transaction is
genuine and a bonafide transaction and had duly been recorded in the books of
NNIH. Therefore, there is no question that the said money be treated as
unexplained money in the hands of the applicant under section 69A of the Act.
Even the Revenue had not brought any material on record which could displace
or controvert the above submission/evidences of the assessee which is
necessary and desirable in order to make an addition under section 68 or 69A
of the Act.
34.22 It is submitted that, on the survey of the order of assessment which has
resulted into a finding the said transaction pertaining to the receipt by the
subsidiary which has been as sham, it is submitted that the same is based on
complete conjectures and surmises without bringing any material. It is well
settled rule of law that apparent is real unless is proved to be contrary. The
learned A.O. in order to arrived at the aforesaid conclusion has firstly at
pages 119 to 120 extracted assessee's reply in response to his notice dated
11.11.2013 and thereafter again at the same page (Pages 120 -123) as extracted
the submissions of the assessee dated 27.11.2013 (pages of 1164 to 1169 paper
book- Volume IV) while dealing with the submissions of the assessee in para
2.3.9 (page 124) he has stated that ―it is undisputed fact that 915948 shares
of NNIH i.e. NDTV Network International Holding BV, were having a face value
of around $1 per share, equivalent to Rs. 40 to 50/- per share approx. at the
relevant time and that the rate at which the shares were subscribed comes to
Rs. 7015.05 per share.‖ 34.23 He has further stated that, it is an undisputed
fact that, ―no independent valuation at all was ever carried out by the group
companies or by the NBCU i.e. Investor company and the issue rate as well as
was the repurchase rate are claimed to be solely based on estimates and
business projections.‖ He has further stated that, it is an undisputed fact
that, during the immediately succeeding F.Y. 2009-10, relevant to A.Y.
2010-11, the very same shares were bought back by NDTV BV, a subsidiary of
NDTV, for Rs. 58.08 crores @ Rs. 634.17 per share. On the aforesaid basis he
called upon the assessee, why such transaction may not be proposed to be
treated as sham and the amount be not proposed to be added as its taxable
income. It is thus apparent, the fundamental basis for making the addition as
has been stated by the learned DCIT in his order at page 124 para 2.3.9 was
that the shares were subscribed by the group companies or by the NBCU @
7015.05 per share and the same shares were bought back by NDTV BV @ Rs. 634.17
per share; whereas the face value of such shares was Rs. 40/-

> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, to 45/- per share.
34.24 A finding to hold a transaction as sham cannot be reached, merely
because on giving such a finding a higher revenue can be generated. Infact,
something more than, the mere yielding of revenue is required is necessary and
by establishing that the purported transaction was merely a paper transaction
and was neither intended to be acted nor in fact it was acted and was a mere
paper transaction, as against a transaction where such a transaction had
factually been undertaken not on papers but has also been implemented in
letter and spirit too. Further it has to be established that the parties to
the transactions had motives to avoid tax whereas in the instant case it has
not been shown that either the assessee had any motive to reduce its tax
liability nor has been shown the shareholder a totally unconnected company had
in any manner reduced their tax liability. The burden to establish the
transaction is from being on revenue, could not be stated to have been
discharged without establishing that the funds by which the shares are
subscribed come from the assessee. It is submitted that this in the absence of
any material, the funds flowed from the assessee's subsidiary or from the
assessee, such a finding that the transaction is sham is on a result of an
arbitrary approach, and is based on mere hypothetical assumptions.
34.25 In response to the aforesaid suspicion of the learned A.O. the assessee
vide its submissions dated 29.11.2013 (pages 1170-1183 of Paper Book)
submitted that, the A.O. in the draft assessment order had proposed the
addition by invoking section 69A of the Act and the assessee discharged its
primary onus which lay upon it, that section 69A of the Act is inapplicable by
its submissions dated 29.04.2013 and 24.10.2013 filed with DRP containing
additional evidences 34.26 The assessee further submitted that, it had also
discharged its onus u/s 68 of the Act, which was sought to be invoked by the
A.O. when it had filed necessary evidence establishing the identity of the
payer i.e. subscriber of the shares, the creditworthiness of the shareholder
and the genuineness of the transaction. The aforesaid transaction was carried
out through banking channels, which was duly recorded in the books of
accounts.
34.27 The learned A.O. thereafter at page 125 in para 2.3.10.1 has recorded
that, the additional evidence furnished by the assessee in response to his
notice establishing the genuineness of the transaction the identity of the
payer i.e. the subscriber of the shares, creditworthiness has discharged when
it had furnished the following evidences:
(i) Copy of Share Subscription Agreement dated 23.05.2008 and Share
Certificate.
(ii) Copies of Annual Reports of NBCU for FYs. 2008 to 2010 filed before
Securities Exchange Commission, US.
(iii) Copy of Annual Report of NDTV for F.Y. 2009-10.
(iv) Copy of Annual Report of GE.
(v) Copy of Form 10K filed by the Comcast Corporation before US Securities and

(vi) Copy of bank account of NNIH in ING Bank, Netherlands.
(vii) Copy of Audited Accounts of NNIH.
34.28 It is submitted that, despite the aforesaid evidence the learned A.O. in
his order at page 125, para 2.3.10.3 has observed that, ―no confirmation from
NBCU regarding the transaction has been filed at all.‖ It is respectfully
submitted that, the aforesaid observation of the learned A.O. has factually
incorrect as it would be seen from page 722-725 of Paper Book-III that the
assessee had furnished a confirmation from NBCU regarding the transaction. It
is pertinent to be stated here that, at page 125 the learned A.O. has observed
as under:
> ―No confirmation from NBCU regarding the transaction has been filed at all.
> Had it been a normal business transaction, it would be necessary for the
> assessee to file confirmation from NBCU, which would be subject to

> 34.29 It is thus absolutely clear that, the learned A.O. had proceeded on an

> regarding the transaction. It is further be noted that, he himself admitted
> that, had it been a normal business transaction such confirmation would have

> substance in view of the facts and discussed in para 2.3.9, (page 124) i.e.
> the issue of the shares at normally high price which was unsupported by any
> valuation and repurchase of the same in the succeeding year for a lower sum
> then admitted it was the issued.
34.30 The appellant submits that, the assumption of the learned A.O. that the
shares were issued by the assessee's subsidiary at an abnormally high price
and then repurchased the same at a lower rate without there being any
valuation made both at the time of purchase and sale, it is respectfully
submitted is highly misconceived. At the first instance, it is submitted the
same is absolutely no test in the eyes of law as the Apex  218 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Court has held in the case of CIT vs. Lovely
Exports Ltd (Supra). that, when a subscription is received by the company from
its shareholder, the amount of share subscription cannot be assessed in the
hands of the company so long it establishes the identity of the shareholder.
In the instant case, it is respectfully submitted that, the learned A.O. has
failed to comprehend that, under Article 141 of the Constitution of India, he
is bound by the said judgment and any further probe is highly unwarranted and
is beyond jurisdiction. The Apex Court has nowhere held that, where shares
have been subscribed at a higher value than the face value, in such cases, an
amount received by the company by way of share subscription can be added to
the income of the company so long it establishes the identity. In the instant
case, it is neither an allegation nor is the finding that the subscriber of
the shares has not established the identity or even the shareholder has denied
to have subscribed the shares.
34.31 It appears to the appellant the aforesaid conclusion, if it is not a
afterthought is based on such material, which has been brought on record by
Shri S. K. Srivastava and has been taken on record by the learned DRP. It is
submitted that Shri S. K. Srivastava an Ex IRS, is the person, who is acting
adversely against persons in general and keeps on feeding his imaginative
ideas before the authorities in order to harass them. The appellant at this
stage is making no further submission but to only add that, it has no
difficulty, if such material which has been brought on record by Shri S.K.
Srivastava is even taken on record for purpose of determination of issued by
Hon'ble Tribunal but only with one prayer that the issue be examined
dispassionately and, not be influenced by his inferences, as had been stated
by him and noted by DRP, as its own findings. In other words, the submission
is that such material, which is general to the issue, be examined
dispassionately but not as Shri S. K. Srivastava, desired to do so 35 To
highlight the aforesaid submission, the appellant seeks to refer straightway
to page 125 of the Appeal Set where the learned Assessing Officer has made an
attempt to justify his conclusion that transaction in sham by observing that
no confirmation has been filed for the transaction at all. He further admits
that had it been a normal business transaction then it would be necessary for
the assessee to file confirmation from NBCU, which would be subject to
verification by the AO, by calling upon the assessee to file an affidavit from
NBCU or to produce the authorized representative of NBCU to confirm the
assertions. It is submitted that the aforesaid finding is not only factually
incorrect but is clear attempt on part of learned Assessing Officer to support
his arbitrary conclusion by disregarding evidence, which is considered
necessary and filed by assessee (pages 668-669 of Paper Book-II). It is thus
submitted at the first instance the order is a vitiated order, as it is
repeated at the risk of repetition that the learned Assessing Officer framed
the assessment with predetermined mind having a focus and mission to make the
addition and for that purpose  219 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, he has
to necessary record the transaction to be ―sham‖ or ―not genuine‖ 35.1 What a
―genuine‖ or ―ingenuine‖ is not a matter of mere discretion but has to be
arrived at a consideration of all such evidence, which are relevant to the
determination. In the instant case despite AO's own finding, he ignored such a
foundational evidence, which in his opinion would have clinched the issue. At
this stage, there was so done, as he had a fear in his mind, he will face the
wrath of Shri S. K. Srivastava. Infact Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case
of P. K. Misra Ex. IRS and CIT had made an adverse inference based against the
role of Shri S. K. Srivastava.
35.2 Apart from the above, a finding to hold a transaction as ―sham‖ cannot be
reached, merely because on giving such a finding a higher revenue can be
generated. Infact, something more than, the mere yielding of revenue is
required is necessary and by establishing that the purported transaction was
merely a paper transaction and was neither intended to be acted nor in fact it
was acted and was a mere paper transaction, as against a transaction where
such a transaction had factually been undertaken not on papers but has also
been implemented in letter and spirit too. Further it has to be established
that the parties to the transactions had motive to avoid tax; whereas in the
instant case it has not been shown that either the assessee had any motive to
reduce its tax liability nor has been shown that the shareholder a totally
unconnected company had in any manner reduced their tax liability. The burden
to establish the transaction is ―sham‖ is on revenue, which could not be
stated to have been discharged without establishing that the funds by which
the shares are subscribed came from the assessee. It is submitted that in the
absence of any material, the funds flowed from the assessee's subsidiary or
from the assessee, such a finding that the transaction is ―sham‖ is a result
of an arbitrary approach, and is based on mere hypothetical assumptions.
35.3 It is further submitted that the finding of the DRP is that the issue of
shares and subscription made by the shareholder is a sham transaction. It is
submitted that, merely because the DRP has concluded the transaction to be
sham by itself is insufficient to hold the transaction which has in reality
been undertaken to be a sham on the ground that the investor at the time of
making subscription did not have any material to satisfy itself that the value
of shares subscribed by it represented the value of shares or that
subsequently after a period of about 18 months, said shares had to be
transferred by the shareholder at a price which was far lower than the value
at which it had subscribed the shares. It is submitted that a transaction can
be held to be a sham transaction which was not intended to be operative, and
was merely a cloak to conceal a different transaction. Reliance is placed on
the following judicial pronouncements:
i) 49 ITR 165 (SC) Kalwa Devadattam and Two Others vs. UOI
ii) 149 TTJ 537 (Cal) ADIT vs Maersk Line UK Ltd
iii) 356 ITR 25 (Kar) Bhoruka Engg. Industries Ltd. vs DCIT  220 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 35.4 It is also added here that a shares
transaction connotes a transaction as a ‗non-genuine' transaction. A
transaction can be said to be ‗non- genuine' which not entered by the parties
to the transaction or if the same is entered but is merely a paper transaction
and, same represents a façade without any initiation to enter into such a
transaction. Further the expression ‗sham' has not been defined under the Act.
To determine, whether transaction is ‗sham' a ‗non-genuine' the same has
judicially been examined is various decisions: Diplock L.J. in Snook vs.
London and West Riding Investment reported in 1967 2Q.B. 786 has held that, ―
I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done, or
documents executed by the parties to the ‗sham' which are intended by them to
give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the
parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights
and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create‖. Further Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Seksaria Sons Pvt. Ltd. reported in
138 ITR 419 at page 424 has held that a transaction without substance can be
regarded as ‗sham'. But a transaction brought in existence for ulterior
purpose does not necessarily become a sham transaction. The Apex Court in the
case of Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. reported in 31 ITR 28 had held that, to
establish the transaction to be sham, the relevant consideration is whether
such a transaction in fact did or did not take place in reality. In otherwords
a transaction can be held to be a sham transaction which was not intended to
be operative and was merely a cloak to conceal a different transaction. A list
of few more cases on this issue are stated in Annexure ―B‖ to this synopsis

No unexpressed intentions of a "shammer" affect the rights of a party whom he
deceived 35.5 In the instant case, by no stretch of imagination, it can be
alleged that the assessee's subsidiary did not issue the shares or the
subscriber to the share capital which acquired 26.% indirect stake in NNPLC
did not make any investment in the subsidiary of appellant 35.6 It is
submitted there is no denying of the fact that such subscriber contributed the
consideration from its own funds and it was duly recorded in their books of
accounts. There is no evidence in rebuttal which has been brought on record to
establish that any such consideration which was contributed by the share
capital came from the sources of the appellant company. Thus the sources of
consideration for acquiring the shares came from the resources of the
investors and appellant's subsidiary or appellant had at no stage contributed
the said sum. The allegation of the revenue is based on assumption, and no
evidence has been brought on record to show the value of said shares was
otherwise, than at which it had been acquired. It is submitted the value of
the said shares at which the shareholder had agreed to make investment was not
a price at which it had been acquired. Even assuming it was so, even then too,
the transaction cannot be regarded as sham so long it is duly confirmed by the
shareholder who has contributed towards the share capital. It is submitted
that the revenue does not have license to hold each and every transaction to
be sham as the same according to it lacks logic. It is submitted that the
burden of proving that a transaction is sham or that the person in whose name
the property stands is not the real owner but is only a sham, is on the taxing
authorities. The presumption is in favour of good faith and non-

35.7 It is well settled rule of law that the prudency and commercial decision
can alone be taken by a business men and It is also a settled law that it is
the prerogative of the businessman to organize its affairs in a manner best
suited to it and the revenue authority cannot step into the shoes of the
businessman and it is not for the revenue to attack a transaction on the
ground that the same was imprudent and thereafter to record the finding that
the same was sham. Attention in this regard is invited to the following
decisions:
i) 53 ITR 140 (SC) CIT vs. Malayalam Plantations Ltd.

35.8 It is submitted that the learned Assessing Officer in the order of
assessment has stated that, no confirmation from NBCU was filed and had the
same was filed it is obvious as he states he could have made an enquiry to
verify after calling upon the assessee to furnish their affidavit, the purpose
to making the investment. 35.40 It is submitted that, on both the aforesaid
grounds, the revenue is factually incorrect. Firstly, the evidence was
furnished before the DRP only when it was called upon to do so that the value
of the shares was based on commercial consideration and was arrived at on the
basis of proper  223 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, working.
This submission was placed before the learned DRP Likewise the A.O.'s finding
that the assessee had not furnished the certificate/confirmation from M/s NBCU
is also contrary to the material on record. In any case and without prejudice,
to hold the transaction to be sham, the test would be applied that the
transaction should not be a facade. However, where the parties to the
agreement accept that such a transaction has been entered into, there can be
no justification to call the same as facade.
36 In view of the aforesaid, the addition made of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- may
kindly be deleted.
85\. Against this, the ld DR referred to the structure of the various entities
of the group and referred to the date when they are formed and when they are
struck off/ merged/ liquidated. He specifically referred to the corporate
structure of the assessee. He submitted that the assessee formed a 100%
subsidiary in the name of NDTV Network BV, Netherland on 09.01.2008 and it
went into liquidation on 25.03.2011. Another subsidiary company in the name of
NDTV Network International Holding, Netherlands was formed on 10.04.2008,
wherein, 68.6% holding was of NDTV Network BV and 31.4% holding was of
Universal Studios International BV. This company was merged with another
entity NDTV Network BV on 01.04.2009. In this company the amount of US$150
million (Rs.642 crores) were received for 31.4% stake. Further, on 28.12.2006
NDTV BV, Netherland was formed and subsequently, on 15.10.2010 it was merged
with NDTV Network BV. The NDTV BV, Netherland was holding 92% of equity in
NDTV Network PLc UK which was formed on 30.11.2006 and liquidated on
28.03.2011. This company was holding shares of various operating companies in
India such as NDTV Labs, NDTV Imagine, NDTV Lifestyle, NDTV Convergence and
NGEN and emerging markets BV. From the above facts, it was submitted that
first subsidiary company was formed 09.01.2008 and second company was formed
on 10.04.2008 and both the companies either were liquidated or merged with
another entity within a very short span of time after receipt of Rs. 642
crores as share capital. He further submitted that after the merger of the
subsidiaries with another companies immediately within a short span of time
the amalgamated company was also liquidated. He further submitted that
shareholders agreement, share subscription agreement and share purchase
agreement entered into by the assessee coupled with the above creation of the
224 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, subsidiaries and their liquidation and
merger along with the money trail shows that the transaction is sham.
86\. He further submitted that confirmation was filed by the assessee only in
December 2013 when there was no time limit available for verification by the
Assessing Officer. He further submitted that assessee has stalled the whole
process of examining the evidences by not furnishing the evidences which are
required. He referred to the agreement of sale and purchase of share to show
that a company who has invested US$150 million has made no valuation at the
time of investment, no due diligence but within a very short time has exited
by selling those shares at US$12 million by incurring huge loss of US$138
million. He further submitted that the investment was made on this date
23.05.2008 and sold on this date 14.10.2009. He therefore, stated that above
structure and the transactions were created in such a manner that it does not
catch eye of the Revenue. He submitted that the whole series of events of
forming of the subsidiaries and their merger or liquidation is done for the
sole purpose of evading tax on Rs. 642 crores.
87\. To substantiate his argument he submitted that trail of the money
received by the subsidiary company also shows that shareholder of the investor
company is by NBCU Dutch holding (Bermuda Ltd). He therefore, submitted that
the claim of the assessee that the money is invested by well-known group of
highest repute is just eyewash. He further submitted that Rs. 642 crores was
received by NDTV Networks International Holdings BV on account of securities
premium from the Universal Studios International BV and a sum of Rs. 643
crores was paid by that company as dividend. Therefore, whatever sum was
received by that company was paid as dividend to NDTV Group Company i.e.NDTV
Networks BV the holding company of NDTV Networks International Holdings BV who
is just holding 68% shares of that company. He referred to page No. 663 of the
paper book of the assessee. He therefore submitted that immediately on receipt
of the money of Rs. 642 crores byNDTV Networks International Holdings BV the
money was siphoned out by way of dividend. He further referred to the balance
sheet of NDTV BV which is also placed at page No. 764 of the paper book to
show that from that money the NDTV Network BV invested a sum of Rs. 450 crores
as an investment in NDTV Mauritius Media Ltd and also in NDTV Networks
International Holdings BV. Therefore, he submitted that  225 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, complete train of Rs. 642 crores received by
the one of the subsidiary has found its way from that subsidiary company to
the parent assessee or its 100% subsidiary. He therefore, submitted that there
is a complete trail of the money which has been proved by the revenue beyond
doubt to show that assessee is the owner of the sum of Rs. 642 crores. He then
referred to the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in case of Vodaphone
International Vs. Union of India and another 341 ITR 1 and specifically para
No. 67 and 68 of that judgment to show that corporate veil has rightly been
lifted by the ld Assessing Officer and the share capital issued in the books
of one of the companies is correctly re-characterized as income of the
assessee. He justified the order of the lower authorities to show that
beneficiary of the above whole transaction through series of subsidiaries is
the assessee. He further relied upon the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in
34 ITR 807 and 53 ITR 623 to say that Revenue need not locate the exact
source. On that basis, he submitted that income has been correctly taxed in
the hands of the assessee.
88\. Ld DR also filed an application dated 05.07.2017 for admission of
additional evidence in the form of I. show-cause notice dated 15.06.2016
issued u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act for the same Assessment Year and II.
application dated 13.05.2016 filed by the assessee for compounding of
contraventions under FEMA 1999.
The application for admission of the additional evidences raised the following
contentions:-
> 1\. That against the returned income declaring loss of Rs. 64,83,91,422/-
> for AY 2009-10 filed by the assessee on 30.09.2009, draft assessment order
> was passed by the AO on 31.03.2013 under section 144 after detailed
> discussion in the order, however, in column 11 of the table at 1st page of
> the order, due to typographical mistake, it was typed as 143(3)/144C(1) and
> the income of the assessee was proposed to be assessed at ₹641,08,11,990/-
> as against loss of ₹64,83,91,422/- declared by the assessee in its return of
> income.
226
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
2\. The assessee filed objections before the Dispute Resolution Panel (―DRP‖)
and the DRP issued directions dated 31.12.2013 under section 144C(5) of the
Act and deleted addition on account of disallowance of Rs. 41,54,41,111/-
proposed under Section 40(a)(ia) out of commission paid, addition of Rs.
7,81,23,855/- on account of disallowance under Section 40(a)(i) proposed out
of transmission & uplinking charges and addition of Rs. 82,45,612/- on account
of disallowance of software expenses. Further, the DRP directed the AO to re-
compute the amount of transfer pricing adjustment, which led to revision of
addition from Rs. 12,41,29,846/- to Rs. 5,09,65,629/-.
3\. The DRP confirmed the addition of Rs. 78,40,990/- proposed by the AO on
account of disallowance under Section 14A. The DRP also confirmed the addition
of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- under Section 69A proposed by the AO on account of
unexplained money. Further, the DRP enhanced the income of the assessee by
another Rs. 254.75 crore under Section 68 of the Act on account of unexplained
credit.
4\. The AO passed final assessment order under Section 144/144C(13) on
21.02.2014 and assessed the income of the assessee at Rs. 838,33,37,197/- as
against loss of Rs. (-) 64,83,91,422/- declared by the assessee in its return
of income.
5\. Against the final assessment order passed on 21.02.2014, the assessee has
filed appeal-bearing ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 and the Revenue has also filed
appeal bearing ITA No. 2658/Del/2014, which are pending before the Hon'ble
Tribunal.
6\. The Revenue humbly prays that after the passing of final assessment order
on 21.02.2014, during the penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act,
certain facts have come to light which have a vital bearing in  227 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the matter. These are explained in detail in
the show cause notice dated 15.06.2016 issued u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, copy
of which has already been filed with the Tribunal by the assessee while
praying for stay of penalty proceedings and wherein the Hon'ble Tribunal vide
order dated 16.09.2016 in SA No. 376/Del/2016 (in ITA No. 1212/Del/2014) has
directed the revenue not to pass final penalty order.
7\. That information has been gathered during the penalty proceedings that the
assessee had applied for compounding of contraventions admittedly made by it
in respect of the provisions of FEMA 1999 while introducing funds through the
corporate structure created by it. Certain admissions have been made by the
assessee in the said compounding applications, which are relevant to the
matter before the Hon'ble Tribunal.
8\. That the above documents are sought to be filed as additional evidence
before the Hon'ble Tribunal, as the same have a vital bearing for adjudication
of matter before the Hon'ble Tribunal.
9\. That the documents sought to be filed could not be filed earlier, because
it is the case of revenue that this Hon'ble Tribunal does not have the
jurisdiction to entertain the assessee's appeal and hence, filing of
application for additional evidence could be construed as admission of
jurisdiction of the Hon'ble Tribunal with respect to the assesse's appeal.
10\. In view of the above, it is humbly prayed that the said documents may
kindly be permitted to be filed as additional evidence.‖
89\. The contention of the revenue for the admission of the additional grounds
was that after passing the final assessment order on 21.02.2014 u/s 144 of the
Act the  228 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, penalty proceedings u/s
271(1)(c) of the Act were initiated and during the penalty proceedings certain
vital facts have come to the knowledge of the revenue which have direct
bearing on the issue involved in this appeal. He submitted that the documents
were sought to be filed now could not be filed earlier because the revenue
strongly believed that appeal of the assessee is not maintainable. However,
when the bench has decided to proceeded with the merits of the issue , then
these additional evidences are required to be looked into as they go to the
root of the matter. He referred to the several clauses of the show cause
notice dated 15.06.2016 to show that various email exchanges between various
persons should be looked into to show that it is complete and full proof case
of tax fraud. He further submitted that during the course of penalty
proceedings it is proved that money is routed back into NDTV(assessee) through
complex cobweb of sham and shell subsidiaries floated abroad which were
created for the sole purposes of this specific financial transaction of money
from one party to the assessee without any obligation of repayment by
assessee. He further submitted that during the penalty proceedings the
statement of Shri KVL Narayan Rao was recorded who is the director of the
company on 23.07.2015 as well as of Mr. Sanjay Dutt on 09.07.2015 where it is
found that assessee has entered into bringing back money invested into
subsidiaries through Bermuda Route in India. He further submitted that
application for compounding of offence under FEMA also shows that while
investing of such money the assessee has used ingenuine methods and violated
the provisions of that Act. He therefore submitted that in fact penalty
proceedings are closely linked and are arising from the assessment
proceedings, therefore, the evidences requested to be admitted as additional
evidence.
90\. The ld AR vehemently objected to the application of admission of
additional evidences which was raised by written submission filed on
06.07.2017 as under:-
> 1\. That on 5th of July' 2017 revenue has filed a paper book containing 80

(MCO 399)
iv) Application dated 13.5.2016 by NDTV for 66 - 80 compounding of
contraventions under FEMA1999 2 It is submitted that, Rule 29 of the ITAT
Rules' 1962 when is read closely, it would be seen that the Rule has
negatively been worded and mandates that, ITAT shall not admit additional
evidence and thus, neither parties can lead additional evidence. However, it
further provides i.e. the second that, additional evidence be admitted if ITAT
requires any document to be produced. In the instant case, it is submitted the
aforesaid evidence as tendered as has been ‗required' to be produced by the
Hon'ble Tribunal. The only other requirement is ―for any substantial cause‖ if
the said ―substantial cause‖ is read with operative provision, then such
evidence can only be admitted when no opportunity has been granted to the
assessee. Thus it is only where an assessee complains that there has been lack
of opportunity such evidence can be either produced or is admitted and not
otherwise. Under the Rules the revenue is not permitted to adduce any fresh
evidence. In fact the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court in the case of CIT vs. Rao
Raja Hanumant Singh reported in 252 ITR 528 had held that even before the
CIT(A), the AO has not been empowered to lead fresh evidence. Further it is
submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mahavir Singh vs.
Naresh Chander reported in AIR 2001 SC 134, a copy of which is enclosed
herewith, while examining the provisions of Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC, which is
para-materia with Rule 29 of ITAT Rules, had exceeded in it jurisdiction of
additional evidence, the  230 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, appellate
proceedings. A copy of the judgment is annexed and is being separately
explained to state the scope of Rule 29 of the powers of the appellate court.
2.1 Apart there from, it is submitted that the additional evidence as
aforesaid is being sought to be ‗adduced' after the assessee's counsel had
concluded his arguments/submissions in respect of the ground Nos. 2 & 3\. It
is submitted if revenue considered to adduce any additional evidence, it
should have sought the liberty' to produce such evidence before the
commencement of hearing and not after the opening submissions were concluded.
The appellant further submits that in fact such evidence is still to be
examined and adjudicated upon by the appropriate authority and thus such
evidence as is alleged to be evidence is not one which deserves to be
considered. The aforesaid submissions are being made which are without
prejudice to the fact that no adverse inference is warranted to be drawn
against the appellant and such evidence has no adverse effect at all. The
appellant however seeks to furnish and place on record copy of its reply
furnished in response to show cause notice dated 15.06.2016 along with
annexures. (Annexure ‗A') 2.2 It is also submitted that, under Rule 27 of
Order 41, production of additional evidence, whether oral or documentary is
permitted only under three circumstances which are: Where (i) the trial Court
had refused to admit the evidence though it ought to have been admitted, (ii)
the evidence was not available to the party despite exercise of due diligence,
and (iii) the appellate court required the additional evidence so as to enable
it to pronounce better judgment or for any other substantial cause or like
nature.[Deverapu Narasimharao vs. Yerrabothula Peda Venkaiah, 1992 (2) ALT
513, 529 (DB)}.
3 It is further submitted that contents of para 1 of the application are
incorrect. It is submitted that there is no material to show that in column 11
at page 1 of the draft order dated 31.3.2013, it was typographically typed as
143(3)/144C instead as 144 of the Act. In fact it is contrary to the  231 ITA

of a compendium of documents filed on 03.07.2017) 3.1 On the contrary reading
of the draft order of assessment, would show that the said draft order was
prepared u/s 143(3) of the Act. It is submitted that jurisdiction to frame
order u/s 144 of the Act was confined to compute income in view of section
145(3) of the Act which too was based on misconception. The detailed
submissions made are at pages 193 - 197 and further in the compendium of
documents filed on 03.07.2017 at pages 69 - 80, a copy which was separately
furnished. The appellant had referred to the judgment of Privy Council in 6
ITR 414 in the case of KhemChand Ram Das.
4 The contents of paras 2 to 5 of the application are factual and therefore
need no rebuttal with the submission that in para 4, it is incorrectly stated
that the assessment has been framed u/s 144 read with section 144C(13) as the
draft was prepared u/s 143(3) and there was no direction by DRP to frame
assessment u/s 144 of the Act. Indeed it is submitted that the conditions
under which assessment u/s 144 could be made were absent and lacking.
5 The contents of paras 6 to 11 are disputed and it is submitted and it is
well settled law that penalty proceedings and assessment proceedings are
separate independent proceedings. In fact, the revenue has filed a writ
petition before the High Court in this very case, where the stand of the
revenue is that the proceedings are separate and independent. Reliance is
placed on the following judgments:
i) 83 ITR 369, 376 (SC) CIT vs. Khoday Eswarsa
ii) 123 ITR 457 (SC) Anantharam Veerasinghaiah vs. CIT
iii) 190 Taxman 157 (Del) CIT v. Arctic Investment (P) Ltd
iv) 145 Taxman 530 (Del) CIT v. Globe Sales Corporation
v) 219 ITR 267 (Del) CIT v. J. K. Synthetics Limited

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 5.1 In view of the above any alleged evidence
which had not been tested as yet even by the AO and allegedly gathered in the
penalty proceedings does not warrant admission under Rule 29 of the Rules.
5.2 It is submitted that mere fact that during independent stay proceedings a
prayer was made to stay the penalty proceedings does not automatically warrant
that the show cause notice as placed on record in the stay proceedings forms
part of the instant proceedings.
5.3 It has been admitted that stay proceedings stood concluded vide order
dated 16.9.2016 in SA No. 376/D/2016. Thus in absence of satisfaction of Rule
29 of the Rules the said evidence does not warrant any admission.
5.4 Likewise application for compounding of offence under FEMA' 1999 also is a
fresh evidence, for which no substantial cause is shown and, its reliance is
contrary to the principles laid out in the cases of Charandas Haridas v. CIT
reported in 39 ITR 202 (SC) and Coca-Cola Export Corpn. vs. ITO reported in
231 ITR 200 (SC) 6 It is therefore respectfully submitted that, since
additional evidence furnished was not available when the assessment had been
framed, the same may kindly not be taken on record.
7 Without prejudice even otherwise it is submitted that none of the evidence
warrant a different view in the matter. It is submitted none of the evidences
placed on record show that appellant either is the ―owner‖ of money or the
share subscription/capital account transaction between two independent
existing genuine entities through banking channels which is duly disclosed is
not a ―genuine‖ transaction.
8 Likewise compounding under FEMA further establishes the genuineness of
transaction and not otherwise.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 9 It is thus submitted that looking from
any angle no addition is warranted of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- u/s 69A of the Act
and, also the additional evidence as furnished does not warrant admission
under Rule 29 of the ITAT Rules.‖
91\. The ld AR further submitted that Revenue does not have any authority for
adducing any fresh evidence. He relied upon the decision of Hon‟ble Rajasthan
High Court in CIT Vs. Rao Raja Hanuat Singh 252 ITR 528 and the decision of
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Mahavir Singh Vs. Naresh Chander AIR 2001 SC 134.
He further objected that after conclusion of the argument by assessee the
revenue cannot make request for admission of additional evidence. It should
have been made only before commencement of the hearing. He further submitted
that show cause notice is based on the statement of Mr. Sanjay Dutt who was
not granted cross examination by the AO and therefore it cannot be said to be
an evidence at all. It was further submitted that proceeding for compounding
of offence under FEMA is a fresh evidence for which no substantial cause shown
for its admission.
92\. He further stated that even otherwise the none of the evidence warrant a
different view in the matter for the simple reason that none of the evidences
placed on record for admission as additional evidence shows that assessee is
the owner of the money. It was further stated that no evidence has been placed
before the bench to show that the transactions are ingenuine. In view of this,
he vehemently objected the application for additional evidence of the Revenue.
93\. In response ld DR first submitted that there is, no Rule that revenue
cannot make an application for additional evidences. He placed reliance on the
decision of the Delhi Bench in UOPLLC Vs. Additional Director of Income Tax
108 ITD 186 to show that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case
the Revenue can adduce additional evidence. He submitted that looking to the
facts of the assessee the additional evidence must be admitted. He further
submitted that order of the coordinate bench in SA NO. 376/Del/2016 in the
appeal of the assessee has granted the interim injunction for passing of the
penalty order. He submitted that tribunal while granting the stay has
exercised its power as it is related to the proceedings  234 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, relating to the appeal. He submitted that
assessee while seeking the stay has itself stated that the penalty proceedings
are relating to the appeal therefore, it cannot be said that show cause notice
issued cannot be admitted as additional evidence. With respect to the cross
examination of the witness he referred to the para No. 8 of the stay order
against passing of the penalty order and submitted that till the order in the
appeal of the assessee tribunal has not allowed to confront the assessee with
result of enquiries conducted with the sole purpose of multiplicity of the
proceedings. Therefore, the stage of cross-examination of Mr. Sanjay Dutt has
not arisen. He further submitted that Shri K V L Narayn Rao is the director of
the company who has signed the appeals and also given the statement then there
is no provision for examination of self. He is acting on behalf of the
company. By saying that assessee wants to cross-examine its own director who
is at helm of all the proceedings of income tax , assessee is making a mockery
of judicial process. The assessee has also accepted the above stay order and
now therefore, cannot question the directions of the tribunal. It was further
submitted that revenue is ready to grant the opportunity of cross-examination
to the assessee of any of the persons whose statement including the director
of the company were recorded as soon as the appeals in quantum proceedings are
decided. Regarding the request for admission at the time of commencement of
argument he submitted that though it cannot be a rule and neither there is a
law but still the above additional evidences are submitted in response to the
arguments of the counsel of the assessee. He further submitted that the
arguments are not concluded yet and hopefully assessee has full chance to
rebut those evidences in the rejoinder. He further referred to Rule 29 of the
ITAT Rules to state that there is no bar in adducing the additional evidences
by the Revenue.
94\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The rule 29 of the
ITAT Rules provides that Production of additional evidence before the
Tribunal.
29\. The parties to the appeal shall not be entitled to produce additional
evidence either oral or documentary before the Tribunal, but if the Tribunal
requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined or any
affidavit to be filed to enable it to pass orders or for any other substantial
cause, or , if the income-tax authorities have decided the case without giving
sufficient opportunity to the assessee to adduce evidence either on points
specified by them or not specified by them, the Tribunal, for  235 ITA No.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, reasons to be recorded, may allow such document
to be produced or witness to be examined or affidavit to be filed or may allow
such evidence to be adduced.] According to that parties to the appeal shall
not be entitled to produce additional evidence either oral or documentary
before the tribunal, but if the tribunal requires any document to be produced
or witness to be examined or any affidavit to be filed to enable it to pass
orders or for any other substantial cause or if the income tax authorities
have decided the case without giving sufficient opportunity to the assessee to
adduce evidence either on points specified by them or otherwise, the tribunal
for reasons to be recorded may allow such evidence to be adduced. On reading
of Rule 29 we do not find any bar against application for admission of
additional evidence by revenue if there is substantial cause. The above view
has further been considered in the decision of coordinate bench in 108 ITD 186
considering the decision of Mahavir Singh Vs. Naresh Chandra of Hon‟ble
Supreme Court and decision of Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court in case of CIT Vs.
Rao Raja Hanumat Singh relied upon by the ld AR. The Coordinate bench has held
as under :-
> "9. In connection with the main issue relating to PE, the Department has

> 13\. Referring to rule 27 of Order 41 of CPC, the learned counsel for the
> assessee submitted that as per the said Rule, which is absolutely pari
> materia to Rule 29 of the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963, the production of
> additional evidence is permitted only under the following three
> circumstances :--
(a)Where the trial court had refused to admit the evidence though it ought to
have been admitted;
(b)Where the evidence was not available to the party despite exercise of due
diligence; and
(c)Where the appellate court required the additional evidence so as to enable
it to pronounce better judgment or for any other substantial cause of like
nature. He contended that none of the aforesaid conditions, however, is
satisfied in the present case so as to warrant the admission of additional
evidence even under Rule 27 of Order 41 of CPC much less under Rule 29 of the
Appellate Tribunal Rules which specifically prohibits the revenue from
producing such additional evidence.
14\. The learned counsel for the assessee also argued that the discretion
given to the appellate authority i.e., Tribunal to allow the production of
additional evidence is strictly circumscribed by the limitations specified in
the aforesaid Rule and the said Rule is not intended to enable a party to
patch up the weak points of his case as held in the case of Muneswari v. Jugal
Mohini AIR 1952 (Cal.) 368 and in the case of N. Kamalam v. Ayyasamy [2001] 7
SCC 503 at page 514. He also relied on the decision of Hon‟ble Punjab &
Haryana High  237 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Court in the case of Gram
Panchayat, Kanehi, Tehsil & District Gurgaon v. Ram Kumar [2001] (2) Punj. LR
186 to contend that the additional evidence in an appellate court cannot be
produced by a party as a matter of right and the essentials of Order 41, Rule
27 have to be satisfied.
15\. The learned counsel for the assessee submitted that there was no evidence
available on record before the Assessing Officer to support the adverse
findings recorded in the order of assessment to the effect that assessee has
an agency PE in India and the additional evidence now being sought to be
produced by the revenue seeks to patch up this weak part of the case attempted
to be made out by the Assessing Officer. He contended that it is thus a clear
attempt being made by the revenue to get the assessment set aside to be made
de novo by seeking the admission of additional evidence and thereby it fill up
the omission by having a second innings which is not permissible as held by
ITAT in the case of Asstt. CIT v. Anima Investment Ltd. [2000] 73 ITD 125
(Delhi)(TM).
16\. The learned counsel for the assessee emphasized that none of the
authorities cited by the learned DR supports the contention of the Department
that it is entitled to lead additional evidence before the Tribunal. On the
other hand, the statement giving details of the various decisions of High
Courts as well as the Tribunal placed at page Nos. 28 and 29 clearly shows
that in none of the cases, the additional evidence sought to be produced by
the Department was admitted by the Tribunal and even such a request made by
the assessee also was not acceded to in some cases. He submitted that even the
assessee has not been able to find any case decided wherein an application has
been made by the revenue under rule 29 of the Appellate Tribunal Rules and the
Tribunal, on an interpretation of Rule 29, has held that the revenue is
entitled to produce additional evidence before it. He contended that this
position clearly supports the stand of the assessee that under rule 29 of the
Appellate Tribunal Rules, there is a complete bar for the revenue to adduce
any additional evidence and its application made for admission of the
additional evidence, therefore, is liable to be rejected.
17\. In support of his aforesaid contentions raised while strongly opposing
the application moved by the Department for admis- sion of additional
evidence, the learned counsel for the assessee has also cited the following
case laws :--
(i) Syed Abdul Khader v. Rami Reddy AIR 1979 SC 553.
(ii) Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Lala Panchan AIR 1965 SC 1008.
(iii) Gurudev Singh v. Mehnga Ram [1997] 6 SCC 507.

18\. The learned CIT-DR contended that the Tribunal may refuse to admit
additional evidence raised before it by any of the parties only if the said
evidence lead to investigation into fresh facts or the same was within the
knowledge of the party and could have been produced earlier. He also contended
that the additional evidence being sought to be produced by the revenue in the
present case, however, does not lead to investigation into fresh facts and the
same having been come to the knowledge and possession of the Department only
during the course of survey carried out at the liaison office of the assessee
as well as at the office of UOPIPL on 10-3-2006, it could not have been
produced earlier before the authorities below. In support of this contention,
he placed reliance on the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of
Manji Dana v. CIT [1966] 60 ITR 582. He also cited the decision of Hon‟ble
Madras High Court in the case of Anaikar Trades & Estates (P.) Ltd. v. CIT
[1990] 186 ITR 3132 wherein certain affidavits given by the five purchasers
affirming receipt of excess consideration than shown in the documents were
sought to be filed by the revenue as additional evidence to support its case
that the provisions of section 52(2) were applicable and the Tribunal admitted
the same and restored the matter to the AAC observing that in order to decide
the question of applicability of section 52(2) which was the subject-matter of
appeal before it, it would be necessary in the interest of justice to consider
the said affidavits. On appeal preferred by the assessee against the order of
the Tribunal, Hon‟ble Madras High Court held that the Tribunal had discretion
to allow production of additional evidence under rule 29 of the Appellate
Tribunal Rules, 1963 if the same was found to be required to enable it to pass
orders or for any other substantial cause.
19\. The learned CIT-DR submitted that there are various cases decided by the
different High Courts wherein the additional evidence sought to be filed by
the revenue was allowed to be admitted before the Tribunal and the same,
therefore, clearly shows that there is no merit in the contention raised by
the learned counsel for the assessee that there is a complete bar for the
Department to even seek the admission of additional evidence. In this regard,
he cited the decision of Hon‟ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Smt. Urmila
Ratilal v. CIT [1982] 136 ITR 7971 wherein it was held after examine the issue
of admission of additional evidence under rule 29 of the Appellate Tribunal
Rules, 1963 that the ITAT was within its jurisdiction in allowing revenue to
produce additional evidence, subject however to the condition, that an
opportunity should be given to the assessee to explain or rebut the said
evidence. He also cited the decision of Hon‟ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in
the case of CIT v. Saligram Prem Nath [1989] 179 ITR 239 2, wherein it was
held that the Tribunal is vested with requisite authority and jurisdiction to
admit additional evidence and material in order to do substantial justice
between the parties. He submitted that to the similar effect are the decisions
of Hon‟ble Delhi High Court in the case of R. Dalmia v. CIT [1978] 113 ITR 522
and that of Hon‟ble Bombay High Court in the case of Smt. Suhasinibai Goenka
v. CIT [1995] 216 ITR 518 3 which fully support the application moved by the
revenue for admission of additional evidence.

20\. Reliance was also placed by the learned CIT-DR on the decision of Hon‟ble
Calcutta High Court in the case of ITO v. B.N. Bhattacharya [1978] 112 ITR 423
wherein it was held that appel- late courts have power to allow additional
evidence not only if they require such evidence "to enable it to pronounce
judgment" but also for "any other substantial cause". Further reliance was
also placed on the decision of Hon‟ble Madras High Court in the case of R.S.S.
Shanmugam Pillai & Sons v. CIT [1974] 95 ITR 109, wherein it was held that if
the Tribunal finds that the documents filed are quite relevant for the purpose
of deciding the issue before it, it would be well within its powers to admit
the evidence, consider the same or remit the matter to the lower authorities.
The learned CIT-DR contended that the additional evidence being sought to be
produced by the Department in the present case was not available for
production before the lower authorities for the reason that the same was
recovered during the course of survey carried on subsequently on 10-3-2006 and
the same, therefore, deserves to be admitted accepting the application filed
under rule 29 of Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 as held by Hon‟ble Kerala High
Court in the case of Asstt. CIT v. Gautam Investments (P.) Ltd. [2001] 250 ITR
3241 .
21\. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the relevant
material on record in the light of various case laws cited at the bar. In the
present case, the application moved by the Department under rule 29 for
admission of additional evidence comprising documents found during the course
of survey car- ried out subsequently at the assessee‟s premises has been
strongly opposed by the learned counsel for the assessee. First of all, his
contention is that as per Rule 29 of Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 there is a
complete bar for the revenue to furnish any additional evidence unless it is
so required by the Tribunal. In effect, his argument is that only if the
Tribunal requires any additional evidence for the purpose of disposing of an
appeal before it, it can direct the Department to furnish the same available
in its possession and it is not permissible to the revenue to move any
application suo motu under Rule 29 seeking admission of additional evidence.
In support of this contention, he has cited six cases decided by the various
High Courts and five cases decided by the Tribunal as enumerated at page Nos.
28 and 29 of his Paper Book-IV wherein the issue relating to admission of
additional evidence was considered and decided. As rightly pointed out by him,
out of these eleven cases, there were only two cases wherein the revenue had
moved an application under Rule 29 for admission of additional evidence and in
both these cases reported as CIT v. Rao Raja Hanut Singh [2001] 252 ITR 528 1
(Raj.) and CIT v. Smt. Kamal C. Mahboobbani [1995] 214 ITR 15 2 (Bom.), the
Department was not allowed to produce the additional evidence and its
applications for admission thereof were rejected. However, a perusal of
decisions rendered by the Hon‟ble High Courts in both these cases shows that
it was nowhere laid down that there is a complete bar for the revenue to seek
admission of additional evidence as sought to be contended by the learned
counsel for the assessee before us.
22\. For instance, in the case of Rao Raja Hanut Singh (supra), the assessee
was a renowned international polo player and a distinguished sportsman. He
frequently used to visit Britain especially during the polo session and had
bank accounts in Britain throughout the relevant period. He received certain
240 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, payments in the said bank accounts
from companies and the said amounts had been utilized by him for meeting his
expenses. The assessee claimed that the amounts so deposited in his bank
accounts were not any consideration on remuneration but only for reimbursement
of expenditure incurred by him in UK. This claim of the assessee, however, was
negated by the Assessing Officer and entire deposits were included by him in
the taxable income of the assessee. On appeal, the Appellate Asstt.
Commissioner, however, deleted the said additions. The revenue appealed to the
Tribunal and moved an application for permission to produce additional
evidence to prove that the deposits made by the companies in the bank accounts
of the assessee were in the nature of commission paid to him and not by way of
reimbursement of expenses as claimed by him. The Tribunal found that there was
no necessity of fresh evidence and accordingly, declined to admit the fresh
evidence sought to be produced by the revenue. Aggrieved by the order of the
Tribunal, the revenue preferred a reference application before the Hon‟ble
Rajasthan High Court which was rejected by their Lordships holding that the
discretion to admit the additional evidence was that of the Tribunal as
circumscribed by Rule 29 of the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 and the
Tribunal having exercised the said jurisdiction in accordance with the said
rule, no question of law arose from its order. In this context, Hon‟ble
Rajasthan High Court referred to the relevant Rule 29 of the Appellate
Tribunal Rules, 1963 and observed on page 535 of the report that the second
limb of the condition of Rule 29 is if the income-tax authorities have decided
the case without giving sufficient opportunity to the assessee to adduce
evidence either on points specified by them or not specified by them. It was
observed by the Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court that a case before it was not a
case where the assessee had raised any grievance that the assessing authority
has decided the case without giving sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence
on any specified or unspecified points and, therefore, this limb of the
conditions obviously was not invoked at all. These observations of the Hon‟ble
Rajasthan High Court clearly indicate that insofar as the second limb of the
conditions specified in Rule 29 relating to "deciding the case without giving
sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence" is concerned, the assessee and
assessee alone can be permitted to adduce additional evidence simply because
the situation as contemplated in this condition can cause prejudice only to
the assessee. Insofar as the first condition in the Rule 29, viz., "if the
Tribunal requires the additional evidence to enable it to pass orders or for
any other substantial cause" is concerned, Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court,
however, noticed on page 535 of the report that this expression is often used
in the Statute in clothing the appellate courts or Tribunals with powers to
allow "parties" to lead additional evidence provided the same enables it to
pass orders or for any substantial cause. It is pertinent to note here the
expression used by the Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court in this context is
"parties" which includes the Department also in its capacity as appellant or
respondent.
23\. Similarly, in the case of Smt. Kamal C. Mabhoobbani (supra) cited by the
learned counsel for the assessee, the facts involved were that the assessee
was an individual who declared of having 21 high denomination notes of Rs.
1,000 each totalling to Rs. 21,000. Her contention of having withdrawn the
equivalent amounts of lower denomination notes from her bank account and  241
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, kept the same at home before converting
into high denomi- nation notes through a family friend was not found
acceptable by the Assessing Officer on scrutiny of her passbook. He, there-
fore, treated the amount of Rs. 21,000 as income of the assessee from
undisclosed sources and added the same to her total income. On appeal, this
addition, however, was deleted by the AAC accepting the stand of the assessee.
This relief given by the AAC to the assessee was challenged by the revenue in
an appeal before the Tribunal and additional evidence in the form of a letter
dated 3-4-1979 was sought to be produced by it by way of additional evidence
before the Tribunal. The Tribunal, however, did not admit the said additional
evidence mainly on the ground that it required investigation of facts and
proceeded to uphold the order of the AAC. Aggrieved by the refusal of the
Tribunal to admit the additional evidence sought to be produced by it, the
revenue filed a reference application before the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court and
considering that the additional evidence sought to be produced by the revenue
was not found to be required by the Tribunal to pass the orders, no fault was
found by their Lordships with the order of the Tribunal refusing to admit the
additional evidence sought to be produced by the revenue. It was observed by
the Hon‟ble Bombay High Court that although the parties to appeal are not
entitled to produce additional evidence before the Tribunal, it has been given
a power to require any document to be produced or any witness to be examined
to enable it to pass order or for any other sufficient cause as per Rule 29 of
the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963.
24\. It is thus clear that none of the decisions cited by the learned counsel
for the assessee lays down a proposition that there is a complete bar for the
revenue to adduce any additional evidence before the Tribunal under Rule 29 of
the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 as sought to be canvassed by him while
opposing the application moved by the revenue for admission of additional
evidence in the present case.
25\. Before us, the learned counsel for the assessee has submitted that he has
not been able to find any case wherein an application moved by the revenue
under Rule 29 has been accepted by the Tribunal allowing it to produce the
additional evidence on inter-pretation of Rule 29. He has also submitted that
none of the authorities cited by the learned CIT-DR supports the contention of
the Department that it is entitled to lead additional evidence before the
Tribunal. On perusal of the decisions cited by the learned CIT-DR, we,
however, find it difficult to accept these submissions of the learned counsel
for the assessee. For instance, in the case of Anaikar Trades & Estates (P.)
Ltd. (supra) cited by learned CIT-DR, the assessee had sold several plots of
land to various parties and the value of properties shown in the docu- ments
of sale was Rs. 2,58,338. The Valuation Officer of the Department estimated
the market value of the property sold at Rs. 4,17,000 and adopting the said
value under section 52(2), the difference of Rs. 2,76,066 (Rs. 4,17,000 - Rs.
1,40,934 as the cost of acquisition of the properties) was brought to tax by
him as capital gains. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held
that it was not established that anything more than the disclosed
consideration had been received by the assessee and accord- ingly, he directed
the ITO to recompute the capital gain taking the sale consideration at Rs.
2,58,338. On appeal to the Tribunal by the Department, it was contended that
the provisions of section  242 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 52(2) were
clearly applicable and reliance in support of this contention was placed on
certain affidavits given by the concerned purchasers affirming therein on oath
that the sale consideration received by them was actually more than what was
shown in the document. The said affidavits were sought to be produced by the
revenue as additional evidence before the Tribunal which was objected by the
assessee on the ground that the said affidavits were available at the time of
assessment proceedings and also at the time of consideration of appeal by the
Appellate Assistant Commissioner and still the revenue did not make use of
that material. The Tribunal, however, took the view that in order to decide
the question of the applicability of section 52(2) of the Act which was the
subject-matter of appeal before it, it would be necessary in the interest of
justice to consider these affidavits and in that view, directed the
restoration of the matter before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner after
allowing the revenue to produce the said affidavits as additional evidence.
The matter was carried before the Hon‟ble Madras High Court and their
Lordships upheld the action of the Tribunal in admitting the additional
evidence filed by the revenue observing that under Rule 29 of the Appellate
Tribunal Rules, if the Tribunal required any document to be produced or
affidavit to be filed to enable it to pass order or for any other substantial
cause, it may allow the document to be produced or the affidavits to be filed.
It was also held by the Hon‟ble Madras High Court that this power conferred
upon the Tribunal under Rule 29 was properly exercised by it in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
26\. Similarly, in the case of R. Dalmia (supra) cited by the learned DR, the
assessee was in control of a number of companies in particular "JT". The ITO
held certain cash credits appearing in the name of the JT as unexplained and
treated the same as the income of the assessee. When the matter went in second
appeal, the learned counsel for the revenue sought the permission of the
Tribunal to place on record the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of
JT for the relevant periods as additional evidence which was vehemently
opposed by the counsel for the assessee. The Tribunal was of the opinion that
the additional evidence sought to be adduced by the revenue was relevant to
the points at issue and would be of assistance to it in deciding the appeal.
The objection of the counsel for the assessee, therefore, was overruled by the
Tribunal and the additional evidence produced by the revenue was admitted. At
the same time, the Tribunal thought that it was only fair that the assessee
should be given an opportunity to explain the additional evidence and the AAC,
therefore, was directed by the Tribunal for giving the assessee to offer his
explanation on the additional evidence and also to lead any further evidence
which he may wish to produce to rebut the said additional evidence. This
action of the Tribunal in admitting the additional evidence comprising balance
sheets and profit & loss accounts of JT was challenged by the assessee before
the Hon‟ble High Court submitting that the Tribunal was in error in admitting
the said additional evidence at the time of hearing of the appeal. This
submission made on behalf of the assessee, however, was found to be devoid of
foundation by the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court observing that whether to admit the
additional evidence or not was in the discretion of the Tribunal and no
prejudice was caused to the assessee because the matter was remitted to the
AAC for affording an opportunity to the assessee to explain the said
additional evidence as well as for recording such further evidence as the
assessee might wish to offer.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
27\. Even in the case of B.N. Bhattacharya (supra) cited by the learned CIT-
DR, the production of the record of the process server by the Department at
the first time before the Hon‟ble Calcutta High Court during the course of
hearing was strongly objected by the counsel for the assessee contending that
such additional evidence could not be relied upon or should not be allowed to
be relied upon in view of the provisions of Order 41, Rule 27 of the CPC.
Relying on the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of K.
Venkataramiah v. A. Seetharama Reddy AIR 1963 SC 1526, it was, however, held
by the Hon‟ble Calcutta High Court that under Rule 27(1) of Order 41 of the
CPC, the appellate court has the power to allow additional evidence not only
if it requires such an evidence "to enable it to pronounce judgment" but also
for "any other substantial cause". Explaining further, it was also observed by
the Hon‟ble Calcutta High Court that there might well be cases where even
though the Court found that it was able to pronounce judgment on the state of
record as it was and so it could not strictly say that it required additional
evidence to enable it to pronounce judgment, it still considered that in the
interest of justice something which remained obscure should be filled up so
that it could pronounce the judgment in a more satisfactory manner, such a
case would be one for allowing additional evidence for any other substantial
cause under Rule 27(1)(b) of Order 41 of the Code. To the similar effect is
the decision of Hon‟ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of Saligram
Prem Nath (supra) cited by the learned CIT- DR wherein it was held that a
Tribunal is vested with the requisite authority and jurisdiction to admit
additional evidence and material in order to do substantial justice between
the parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal was directed by Hon‟ble Punjab &
Haryana High Court to decide the matter afresh by taking into account the
material placed on record by the revenue after affording an opportunity to the
assessee to rebut it if necessary by adducing additional evidence. It was also
clarified by their Lordships that it would be open to the Tribunal either to
deal with the matter itself or to remand the case for this purpose to the ITO.
28\. The decision of Hon‟ble Kerala High Court in the case of Midas Rubber
(P.) Ltd. v. CIT [1998] 232 ITR 8241 also supports the case of the revenue
that it can move an application for admission of additional evidence before
the Tribunal. In the said case, additional evidence comprising of work sheets
showing calculation of surtax was filed by the Department and admitting the
same, the issue relating to change of previous year under the Income-tax Act
was decided by the Tribunal against the assessee relying thereon. When this
decision of the Tribunal was challenged by the assessee, Hon‟ble Kerala High
Court upheld the action of the Tribunal in admitting the additional evidence
filed by the Department. However, keeping in view the facts of the case, it
was held by the Hon‟ble Kerala High Court that while deciding the appeal of
the assessee, proper procedure was not followed by the Tribunal in the sense
that the matter should have been remanded by it to the Assessing Officer.
29\. Keeping in view the aforesaid decisions of various High Courts cited by
the learned CIT-DR which were decided after taking into consideration Rule 29
of the Appellate Tribunal Rules, we find it difficult to accept the contention
of the learned counsel for the assessee that there is a complete bar for the
revenue to produce any additional evidence suo motu and it can be permit- ted
to do so only if the Tribunal requires such evidence and accordingly directs
the Department to produce the same. In our opinion, the first limb of
condition  244 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, stipulated in rule 29
clearly permits both the parties to the appeal to produce additional evidence
and seek the leave of the Tribunal for admission thereof making out a case
that the same shall enable it to pass orders or for any substantial cause and
if the Tribunal is satisfied that the additional evidence so produced is
required to enable it to pass orders or for any other substantial cause, it
can allow the parties including the revenue to produce such additional
evidence exercising its discretion in terms of the said Rule.
30\. It is a settled position that production of additional evidence at the
appellate stage is not a matter of right to litigating public and allowing of
production of additional evidence is in the discretion of the Tribunal. The
said discretion however, is to be exercised judicially and not arbitarily. As
held by Hon‟ble M.P. High Court in the case of CIT v. Kum. Satya Setia [1983]
143 ITR 486 1, it is within the discretion of the appellate authority to allow
production of additional evidence if the said authority requires any document
to enable it to pass orders or for any other substantial cause. The Tribunal
is the final fact-finding body under the scheme of the Income-tax Act and
powers, therefore, have necessarily to be exercised by it for deciding the
questions of fact. While exercising its powers, if the Tribunal is of the
opinion that additional evidence is material in the interest of justice for
deciding a particular issue, its discretion cannot be interfered with unless
it has been exercised on non-existing or imaginary grounds. In the case of
Mahavir Singh (supra ) cited by the learned counsel for the assessee, it was
held that section 107 of CPC enables an appellate court to take additional
evidence or to require such other evidence to be taken subject to such
conditions and limitations as are prescribed under Order 41 of Rule 27 of CPC.
It was also held that the parties are not entitled, as of right, to the
admission of such evidence and the matter is entirely in the discretion of the
court which is of course to be exercised judicially and sparingly. It was
observed that Order 41, Rule 27 of CPC envisages certain circumstances when
additional evidence can be adduced and one of such circumstances is where the
appellate court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be
examined to enable it to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial
cause. It was also clarified that the expression "to enable it to pronounce
judgment" contemplates a situation when the appellate court finds itself
unable to pronounce judgment owing to a lacuna or defect in the evidence as it
stands. In this context, it was further clarified that the ability to
pronounce a judgment is to be understood as the ability to pronounce a
judgment satisfactory to the mind of court delivering it. This position was
reiterated again by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Syed Abdul Khader
v. Rami Reddy AIR 1979 SC 553 cited by the learned counsel for the assessee.
In the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Lala Panchan AIR
1965 SC 1008 cited by the learned counsel for the assessee, it was observed by
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court that the power to admit additional evidence does not
entitle the appellate court to let in fresh evidence only for the purpose of
pronouncing judgment in a particular way and it is only for removing a lacuna
in the evidence that the appellate court is empowered to admit additional
evidence. In the case of Arjan Singh v. Kartar Singh AIR 1951 SC 193, it was
held that the discretion given to the appellate court by Order 41, Rule 27 of
CPC to receive and admit additional evidence is not an arbitrary one but is a
judicial one circumscribed by the limitations specified in that Rule. It was
also held that the legitimate occasion for the application of the said Rule is
245 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, when on examining the evidence as it
stands some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent. To the similar effect
is another decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of Natha Singh v.
Financial Commissioner, Taxation AIR 1976 SC 1053.
31\. As per rule 29 of the Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963, the Tribunal has
the power to allow additional evidence not only if it requires such evidence
"to enable it to pronounce judgment" but also "for any other substantial
cause". There may be cases where even though the Tribunal finds that it is
able to pronounce judgment on the state of record as it is and so it cannot
strictly say that it requires additional evidence to enable it to pronounce
judgment, it still considers that in the interest of justice, something which
remains obscure, should be filled up so that it can pronounce the judgment in
a more satisfactory manner. Such requirement of the Tribunal is likely to
arise ordinarily when some inherent lacuna or defect becomes apparent upon its
appreciation of the evidence. The power of the Tribunal to admit additional
evidence in support of the claim in appeal is discretionary and no fetters can
be imposed on the exercise of such power. However, as held by Hon‟ble
Allahabad High Court in the case of Ram Prasad Sharma v. CIT [1979] 119 ITR
8671 and by the Hon‟ble Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of A.K. Babu
Khan v. CWT [1976] 102 ITR 756, it is not an arbitrary power but it is a
judicial one circumscribed by the limitations given in Rule 29 of the
Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963. The conditions precedent for the exercise of
power under Rule 29 must, therefore, be found to have been established.
However, where there is no lack of evidence but yet the plea in support of
admitting the evidence is so decisive and of clinching value with reference to
the points at issue, it is open to the Tribunal to invoke its power of
allowing additional evidence to render substantial justice and not to deprive
the party of such justice on technical grounds. Further, as held by Hon‟ble
Bombay High Court in the case of Velji Deoraj & Co. v. CIT [1968] 68 ITR 708,
when the evidence was available to the party at the initial stage and had not
been produced by him, the mere fact that evidence sought to be produced is
vital and important does not provide a substantial cause to allow its
admission at the appellate stage. The admissibility of additional evidence
depends on whether or not the Tribunal requires it to enable it to pass orders
or for any other substantial cause and not to enable the assessee or the
Department to tender fresh evidence to support a new point or to make out a
new case. In the case of N. Kamalam (supra) it was held that the provisions of
Rule 27, of Order 41 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 are not designed to help
parties to patch up weak points and make up for omissions earlier made.
32\. In the case of Smt. Girijamma v. Kamala Engg. Works AIR 2000 Kar. 239, it
was held that when there was a failure on the part of the applicant to produce
the documentary evidence during trial in spite of having knowledge as to its
existence, he could not be permitted to adduce the same as additional evidence
in appeal. This position has been reiterated in the case of Mandala Madhava
Rao v. Mandala Yodagiri AIR 2001 AP 407 wherein it was held that additional
evidence can be adduced, inter alia, where the party seeking to produce
additional evidence establishes that notwithstanding the exercise of due
diligence, such evidence was not within their knowledge or could not after the
exercise of due diligence be produced by him at the time when the decree  246
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, appealed against was passed and the
appellate court requires the said evidence to be produced to enable it to
pronounce the judgment. Similarly, in the case of Ram Kumar (supra) cited by
the learned counsel for the assessee, it was held by the Hon‟ble Punjab &
Haryana High Court that additional evidence cannot be claimed as a matter of
right in the appellate court and it has to be shown by the litigants that the
proposed additional evidence was not in their power or possession or was not
in their knowledge.
33\. It is also well-settled that once additional evidence is taken into
consideration, it has to be read as part of the record and before drawing any
inference on the basis of contents of that document admitted as additional
evidence, an opportunity has to be given to the other side to explain or rebut
the same. As held by Hon‟ble Madras High Court in the case of R.S.S. Shanmugam
Pillai & Sons (supra), if the Tribunal finds that the documents filed are
quite relevant and for the purpose of deciding the issue before it, it would
be well within its powers to admit the evidence, consider the same on merits
or remit the matter to the lower authorities for examining the same. In the
case of Smt. Urmila Ratilal ( supra), Hon‟ble Gujarat High Court has held that
when the additional evidence filed by the revenue was admitted by the Tribunal
overruling the objection raised by the assessee, interest of justice demanded
that the assessee was given an opportunity to explain or rebut the additional
evidence before relying on the same. In the case of Charbhai Biri Works v.
Asstt. CIT [2003] 87 ITD 189 cited by the learned counsel for the assessee, it
was held by Pune Bench of ITAT in its Third Member decision that when the
documents which were not available before the Assessing Officer were produced
before the Tribunal for the first time and the same were admitted as
additional evidence being material and relevant for adjudicating the matter,
the issue was required to be restored to the file of the Assessing Officer to
verify correctness and authenticity of such documents and to adjudicate the
matter afresh after providing adequate opportunity to the assessee of being
heard.
34\. Keeping in view the legal position as regards the matter of admission of
additional evidence by the appellate authority as emanating from the various
judicial pronouncements discussed above, we can now endeavour to examine the
various documents being sought to be filed by the revenue in the present case
as additional evidence by appreciating and ascertaining their relevancy as
well as requirement to adjudicate upon the issue in dispute in the present
appeal or for any other substantial cause in terms of Rule 29 of the Appellate
Tribunal Rules, 1963.
The above evidences were not in possession of revenue at the time of passing
of the original order or before ld DRP but have been collected during the
course of penalty proceedings and also after filing of the appeal by the
assessee. In fact the additional evidences are two statements of different
persons one of them is the director of the company and second is also of the
close associate of the assessee. The close associates of the assessee have
produced certain copies of emails where he is one of the recipient of such
mails along with others. In fact the mails  247 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, are already available with the assessee as senior officers
including chairman is recipient of those mails and has actively communicated
through those mails. Hence they were in facts in possession of assessee since
the mails are exchanged. Furthermore, regarding not making the prayer at the
time of the commencement of the hearing we do not find that such an argument
is at all relevant, as the assessee will get ample opportunity to rebut those
evidences. Further with respect to the utility of those evidence in deciding
the issue before us we are of the opinion that revenue has challenged that
copy of the agreement dated 23.05.2008 filed during the course of assessment
proceedings is not a reliable evidence as same was not signed by the actual
parent of the company. It was further submitted that the revenue has further
found that the agreement does not have any evidentiary value, as it was
neither apostle certified or were signed by any of the parties on each page.
it is further found by the revenue that parent company of Universal Studios
International BV which invested US$150 million in the subsidiary company of
the assessee and it was stated by the assessee NBC Universal Inc. , USA was
its parent company which was found to be incorrect as 100% share of investor
company were held by NBCU Dutch Holding Bermuda Ltd as a general managing
partner of CA holding CB Bermuda. Even this company was not a party to any of
the agreement placed before the lower authorities. Furthermore, the revenue
has found that money introduced as share application money and securities
premium is transferred to NDTV (assessee) in the form of dividend. It was
further found by revenue that various emails between the group of persons
completely show the modus operandi employed by the assessee for rerouting the
money through complex cobweb of sham subsidiaries abroad. It is further
alleged that various subsidiaries formed by the assessee for a limited period
were in the nature of „shell companies‟ and which lacks substances in those
jurisdiction. As the issue involved in the present ground before us relates on
these aspects of agreements and formation of various structure by the assessee
and the financial train of investment made by investor company and subsequent
shown to the assessee group companies at a phenomenal loss without any
justifiable reason. All these evidences go to rot of the matter. If we do not
admit these evidence which are so vital that they clearly speaks about the
mind of the persons to achieve ultimate objective and what is to be disclosed
selectively to whom and in  248 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, what matter
so the user of such communication is not able to reach at the intent and
purposes of the transaction. Therefore, there is just cause for admission of
these additional evidences for deciding the issue. Regarding the issue of
cross- examination of Mr. Sanjay Dutt we fully agree that no cross-examination
was granted to the assessee and therefore, it cannot be used against the
assessee. However, with respect to the various mails referred by the ld AO in
the show cause notice replied by the assessee vide letter submitted on
02.11.2016. As per page No. 32 of the reply of the assessee 8 emails exchange
were recorded and assessee has not denied the existence of such mail. The
assessee has merely requested the ld AO to verify the authenticity and
genuineness of such mail. In view of this these email exchanges are not denied
or said to be fraudulent by the assessee their evidentiary values cannot be
discarded. The correspondence in those mails clearly throws light on the state
of arrangements made by the assessee and further corroborated by the various
evidences produced by the assessee in its paper book submitted before us. With
respect to the statement of Mr. Narayan Rao , who is the director of the
company, filing the appeals before his under his signature for the company and
who is part of the complete transaction as one of the main executors we donot
find it necessary that unless the cross examinination is granted to assessee
of Mr. Narayan Rao it cannot be used. Further the compounding of offences
under FEMA is a statutory record only of submission before other statutory
authorities. In view of this we are of opinion that the application for the
admission of the additional evidence of the Revenue deserves to be accepted
and for the reasons recorded by us as above we are of the opinion that those
evidences are required to be admitted for the substantial cause of
adjudication on the merits of the addition. Therefore, the application of the
revenue for admission of additional evidence succeeds.
95\. The ld AR in rejoinder to the argument of the ld DR on ground of addition
of Rs.
6425422000/- is as under:-
1\. Ground Nos. 3 to 3.3 of Grounds of Appeal relate to addition made of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- representing share capital raised by NDTV Networks

as ―investee company‖) and brought to tax as income of the appellant company
u/s 69A of the Act.
1.1 The learned Assessing Officer in pursuance to directions of Dispute
Resolution Panel (―DRP‖) has made the aforesaid addition by holding (pages
148-149 of Appeal Set) as under:
―8.14 In view of the above detailed facts and circumstances of the case and in
compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble DRP as reproduced above, it is
held that the transaction involving the receipt of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- by the
assessee's subsidiary company during the year is a ―sham‖ transaction, through
which the assesee has introduced its own unaccounted money and the same
therefore represents the unexplained money owned by the assessee, regarding
the nature and source of which the assessee has not been able to offer
satisfactory explanation. The amount of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- is hence added to the assessee taxable income u/s 69A of the
Act.‖ 2 The learned counsel for the revenue in support of the aforesaid
addition has conceded that he neither disputes the identity of the investor
company, namely Universal Studios International BV (hereinafter referred to as
―USBV‖ or alternatively as ―investor company‖) and nor the creditworthiness of
the investor company.
2.1 He however submitted that he only disputes the genuineness of the
transaction of investment made by the investor company into the investee
company so as to contend that the said sum is assessable as income in the
hands of the appellant company.

contention is misconceived both on facts and in law.
2.3 It is well settled law that subscription to ―share capital‖ is in the
nature of ―capital receipt‖ and could not be brought to tax even in the hands
of the investee company, much less in the hands of appellant company. Reliance

2.4 Moreover, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT v. Kamdhenu
Steel and Alloys Ltd. reported in 361 ITR 220 at page 227 has held as under
―The genuineness of the transaction is to be demonstrated by showing that the
assessee had, in fact, received money from the said shareholder and it came
from the coffers from that very shareholder. The Division Bench held that when
the money is received by cheque and is transmitted through banking or other
indisputable channels, genuineness of transaction would be proved.

2.5 It is undisputed that share subscription was received from the investor
company through banking channels and thus the aforesaid contention disputing
the genuineness of investment by way of share subscription lacks valid
justification.
2.6 It is submitted from the evidence on record, it is apparent that M/s
Universal Studios International BV, the shareholder was an associate of NBC
Universal Inc. which is a group company of GE Group one of the largest company
in the world. (see page 684 of PB Vol. II). Thus where the funds have came
through banking channels from an well established entity, the assumption and
presumption of the authorities that the transaction is sham and the amount
received by the subsidiary of the assessee was the assessee's own money is a
matter, which it is submitted cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny. It
has been not been shown that either no funds came as reflected in the bank
account of investee company or it was the assessee's own funds by leading
positive material. The conclusion is based on frivolous, unsubstantiated
allegation that, it was assessee's own money and without leading any tangible
material. Contention has been raised only on the basis of suspicion and
without any material.
2.7 It is emphasized that there is no material much less any valid evidence
either emerging from orders of authorities below or even from the contentions
of the learned counsel for the revenue to show that appellant is the ―owner‖
of the sums received as share subscription by the NDTV Networks International
Holdings BV (―NNIH‖) from USBV, an independent investor company.

New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.8 It is thus respectfully submitted that
mere allegation based on an erroneous assumption that the transaction is ―non
genuine‖ does not imply statutorily or even otherwise that appellant is
―owner‖ of money received as share subscription by the subsidiary of the
appellant company and, therefore the addition u/s 69A of the Act is perse
without jurisdiction.
3 The revenue instead of discharging the aforesaid burden u/s 69A of the Act
to show that appellant is ―owner‖ of money by leading any valid evidence has
attempted to side track the aforesaid issue by essentially making two fold
submissions:
a) That there is no burden on the revenue to locate the source of income and
reliance has been placed on two judgments of Apex Court in the case of A.
Govindarajulu Mudaliar v. CIT reported in 34 ITR 807 and CIT v. M. Ganapathi
Mudaliar reported in 53 ITR 623;
b) That since the structure is complex and the subscription is at a huge
premium (which is not explained through any valuation) and there has been
winding up of the structure in short duration and, ultimately since the flow
of money is to appellant company establishes that transaction is ―sham‖ and,
thus not a genuine transaction;
4 It is submitted that none of the aforesaid contention even remotely lead to
an in-escapable conclusion that assessee is the ―owner‖ of money received as
share subscription by NNIH through banking channel from USBVso as to invoke
section 69A of the Act.
4.1 The appellant seeks to emphasize here at the risk of repetition (though
not disputed) that burden u/s 69 A of the Act is on revenue to show that
capital received by an independent subsidiary company from an independent  253

appellant company, which burden in the respectful submission remains
undischarged, when no evidence has been placed on record, other than
rhetorical submissions based upon arbitrary inferences from no tangible
material.

4.3 It is submitted that the learned Assessing Officer has not made any
adverse observations with regard to the documentary evidence led by the
appellant company. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT vs. M/s
Kamdhenu Steel and Alloys Ltd. reported in 361 ITR 220 has held that, no
addition can be made by disbelieving the material placed by assessee, as he
could have used coercive powers available to him. Reliance is also placed on
the judgment of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in the case of Nathu Ram Prem
Chand v. CIT reported in 49 ITR 561 and EMC Machine Works v. CIT reported in
49 ITR 650 wherein it has been held that, burden is on the Assessing Officer
to enforce the attendance of the creditors. Likewise Hon'ble Delhi High  256
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Court in the case of CIT vs. Jitin Gupta
decided on 03.03.2009 has held that once necessary evidence has been placed on
record and the learned Assessing Officer has not led any material to the
contrary; no adverse inference can be drawn. Also in the case of CIT vs.
Genesis Commet (P) Ltd reported in 163 Taxman 482 (Del) it has been held that,
an officer, if he was not inclined to believe the material placed by assessee
he could have used coercive powers available to him 4.4 It is thus submitted
that revenue is blowing ―hot‖ and ―cold‖. It is submitted that having accepted
the genuineness of the documents tabulated in para 4.2 above, including the
agreements contention that further enquiries could not be made on account of
delay in filing of apposilited confirmation is an afterthought. It is
submitted at no stage either during the proceedings before passing the draft
order or in the remand proceedings before DRP, the revenue attempted to make
any enquiries and thus in absence of enquiries; adverse inference drawn is
highly untenable.
4.5 It was contended at the time of hearing that in the course of assessment
proceedings before the draft was prepared on 31.03.2013 the assessee had filed
no confirmation from the investee company. The contention is based by
overlooking the fact that there was no investment was made by the investee
company with the assessee and the AO had made no enquiry whatsoever on the
contrary before the ADIT, as submitted the due details as required were
furnished and as such there arose no occasion to furnish any such
confirmation. The assessee however on 24.10.2013 furnished the confirmation
before the DRP, a copy whereof was forwarded by DRP and in the report dated
11.12.2013, the AO never stated that such a confirmation is to be ignored as
the same was not apostilled. However the assessee by way of abundant
precaution considered appropriate to have the confirmation apostilled and as
such was furnished. The submission  257 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
made by the learned counsel is not only an afterthought but is an attempt to
wriggle out from the submissions made by the assessee that the revenue did not
dispute the confirmation. In fact as stated above all such documents which
were not also apostillised are also not disputed. Further the bank account of
the investee company which reflect the remittances is sufficient to establish
the confirmation supported by audited accounts, no other confirmation in fact
is required.
5 Furthermore it is submitted the aforesaid two contentions stated in para 3
are neither here and nor there. It is submitted that it is not any or every
assertion is a material. There has to be relevant material to establish
ownership and further to establish the explanation furnished is
unsatisfactory. What is supported by evidence cannot be regarded as no
evidence or not sufficient material.
6 Taking up the former contention, it is submitted that, both the judgments of
Apex Court in the case of A. Govindarajulu Mudaliar v. CIT reported in 34 ITR
807 and CIT v. M. Ganapathi Mudaliar reported in 53 ITR 623 have no
application to the facts of the appellant company.
6.1 It is well-settled that judgment is a proposition what it actually decides
and, not what logically or remotely can be deduced therefrom as has been held
in the following cases:

the setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington
v. British Railways Board [1972] 2 WLR 537 (HL). Circumstantial flexibility,
one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between
conclusions in two cases.‖
iii) 198 ITR 297 (SC) CIT v. Sun Engineering Works P. Ltd.
6.2 It is submitted that in the case of A. Govindarajulu Mudaliar v. CIT
reported in 34 ITR 807 (SC) there was a credit in the accounts of the assessee
in the books of the firm in which assessee was a partner. The AO rejected the
explanation regarding the credits in the account of the assessee in the books
of the firm. It was thus held that said credits are income of the assessee. It
is submitted in the instant case it is undisputed that there is no credit in
the name of the appellant in the books of NNIH. The credit in the books of
NNIH is to account of USBV and therefore even assuming that explanation is not
found satisfactorily (though wholly disputed) it does not lead to any
conclusion that assessee is the owner of the money received as share
subscription by NNIH from USBV. It is thus submitted that the aforesaid
judgment has no application to the facts of the case of the appellant company.
6.3 As regards the judgment of Apex Court in the case of M. Ganapathi Mudaliar
reported in 53 ITR 623, the revenue has relied on the following observation in
the judgment:
> ―Once it is held that 86,500 dollars was the income of the assessee, it was
> not necessary for the revenue to locate its exact source. On this material,
> we cannot say that there is no evidence in support of the finding of the
> Tribunal.‖  259 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
> (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 6.4 It will be apparent
> that in the above judgment it was found as a matter of fact that it was
> ―income‖ of the assessee and therefore the revenue was not required to
> locate the exact source of such income. However, there is no such evidence
> to show that share subscription by USBV of NNIH is income of the assessee
> and on that ground alone, the reliance placed on the above judgment is breft
> of any merit. Furthermore even otherwise it will be noted that in the said
> judgment, the real controversy between assessee and revenue was on the issue
> whether the sum of 87,500 dollars, which was credited to one Ayyaru in the
> assessee's account on January 7, 1946, was Ayyaru's money, which had been
> borrowed by the assessee or whether the entry was fictitious and the money
> really belonged to the assessee himself. However, in the instant case, there
> is no credit in the books of accounts of the assessee and thus even
> factually speaking, the said judgment has no application.
6.5 In view of the above it is submitted that in absence of any evidence to
show that the money came from coffers of the assessee instead of coffers of
the shareholder so as to allege that assessee is the ―owner‖ the addition made
is factually and legally misconceived.
7 Now taking up the latter contention it will be seen that the revenue has
referred to the following three agreements:
i) Share subscription agreement dated 23.5.2008(pages 107-222 of Paper Book-I)
ii) Share holder agreement dated 23.5.2008(pages 10-104 of Paper Book-I)
iii) Agreement dated 14.10.2009 for the sale and purchase of shares in NDTV BV
between Universal Studios International B.V., NBC Universal, INC, NDTV
Networks B.V., NDTV BV., NDT Networks PLC and NDTV (pages 1239-1263 of Paper

2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 7.1 It is submitted that on
the basis of the aforesaid agreements the learned counsel has contended that
it is not a case of pure and simple purchase and sale of shares, as claimed by
the appellants but is a device created by which in a short duration, funds
received as a share capital has been received by the appellant (instead of
funds received as a share capital by M/s NDTV Networks International
Holdings). The aforesaid allegation it is submitted is totally disputed which
lacks any substance to hold that the fund received were the sums owned by the
assessee to be taxed u/s 69A of the Act.
7.2 The Hon'ble Bench during the course of hearing directed the assessee to
file a copy of the memorandum of agreement dated 22.1.2008 entered between
USBV, NBCU and NDTV Networks B.V. It was also directed to clarify that whether
such MOU has been placed on record by the appellant company.
7.3 It is submitted that the copy of the MOU had been on record during the
course of assessment proceedings for assessment year 2008-09 in pursuance to
the direction of the learned Assessing Officer. A copy of MOU dated 22.1.2008
alognwith the reply is enclosed at pages 5-20 of PB Volume-VIII. It may be
stated here that no adverse inference had ever been drawn on the basis of the
aforesaid MOU in order of assessment dated 03.08.2012 u/s 143(3) of the Act.
7.4 The assessee also hastens to add here that there was no direction ever to
produce the aforesaid MOU by any of the authorities below during the
assessment/DRP proceedings and thus the contention of the learned counsel the
same is not on record is firstly factually incorrect and secondly is
misconceived as there is nothing in the MOU which is adversely considered.
7.5 Apart from the above it is also stated that the Hon'ble Bench sought
copies of list of documents Annexure as Annexure I (page 215 of Paper Book) to
the share subscription agreement. The copies of the  261 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014

ix) 16.11.2009 253-256 8 Apart from the above, the learned counsel for the
revenue has stated that a reading of the aforesaid agreements shows that there
was complete due diligence made by NBCU but the valuation as part of the
aforesaid due diligence has not been shared by the assessee. It is submitted
that it is obvious that such a due diligence as was got done by NBCU is to be
with NBCU and not with the assessee and as such  264 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, their contention the same has not been shared, overlooks the
fact that assessee being not a privy to such a document could not be in
possession thereof. In any case it is submi9tted the same is inconsequential.
In fact the assessee had obtained valuation in respect of its enterprise value
which had been valued at 526 million USD in November, 2006. (Copy of
furnished) It is added here that in fact on the basis of same report
investments were made in May 2007 and March 2007 by Institutional Bond holders
and FUSE Plus Media who had made investment of USD 100 million and USD 20
million respectively for proposed equity stake of 20% to 30%. Further, the
investor (NBCU) and NDTV Group had agreed for business projection under the
shareholders agreements itself which is titled as Annexure - 1, (Business
plan) (Pg. 73 - 93 of PB) 8.1 He further contended that shares have been
issued at an exorbitant premium though the company was incorporated only in
April' 2008 and thereafter also wound up in April' 2009.
9 It is submitted that charging of premium on fresh issue of shares is based
on the business potential of the group which mainly consists of the
entertainment vertical of the business. It is settled in law that share
premium received on the issue of shares has to be included in the paid up
capital irrespective of whether the share premium has been maintained in a
separate account apart from the reserve as held in the case of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs Allahabad Bank Ltd. reported in 73 ITR
745. A detailed note on the formation of subsidiaries, their activities and
the basis of valuation of USD 150 Mn. is separately enclosed as Annexures I
and 2 of Note 1 already on record, though it is specific averment of the
appellant that it would not be material in order to invoke the provisions of
section 69A of the Act.
9.1 To support that the issuance of share premium without having valuation
done has no consequence, the appellant placed its reliance on the ruling of
the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of M/s. Green Infra Ltd  265 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, v ITO reported in 159 TTJ 728 wherein the newly
incorporated company issued shares of Rs. 10 at share premium of Rs. 490,
though it had yet to start its business. The aforesaid decision has been
affirmed by the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT v.
Green Infra Ltd. reported in 392 ITR 1.
9.2 Also Hyderabad Tribunal, in ITA No 1775/HYD/2014 in Hariom Concast & Steel
(P) Ltd vs ITO, vide judgment dated 05.10.2016 has held that:
> ―8. The other case law relied on by assessee is also on the issue that share
> premium cannot be brought to tax invoking the provisions of Section 68,
> unless there is a link with either quid pro quo transaction or investing by
> assessee-company in their accounts so as to receive it back as share
> capital. No such, evidence was brought on record. On the given facts of the

> hold that this amount can be brought to tax invoking the provisions of

> in dispute. What AO disputed was the amount of premium. Moreover, if the
> amounts are doubted from those companies, the amount of share capital at
> Rs.10 was not doubted.
> Only amount of premium was doubted. Therefore the companies' transactions

> Reliance is also placed on the judgment of Jurisdictional High Court in case
> of CIT vs. Empire Buildtech (P) Ltd. reported in 366 ITR 110.
> 9.4 The appellant also submits that the amendment made by the Finance Act,
> 2012, wherein the legislature had inserted section 56(2)(vii)(b) of the Act,
> wherein they have intended to tax the amount of share premium received in
> excess of the Fair Market Value of the shares as ―Income from Other

> non-resident companies and the provisions of the domestic law would have no
> application whatsoever.
10 The learned counsel for the revenue also contended that subsequently in a
short period of time said share capital was repurchased at a much lesser price
which resulted into capital loss in the hands of the investor (USBV) which
rendered entire transaction sham as it had no commercial and economic
substance.
10.1 It is submitted that the said allegation is completely misconceived and
devoid of any merits on account of the following reasons:
267
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
> i) The subsequent event of repurchase would not be material to determine the
> nature of the original transaction specially when the provisions of section
> 69A of the Act are invoked. On the contrary, the reliance on the same proves
> that original transaction of subscription of shares is beyond any suspicion
> and ingredients of section 69A of the Act to tax the original transaction do
> not survive. In other words, the fact that the investments were repurchased
> subsequently shows that the original transaction is neither tainted or
> illegal which warranted the lifting of corporate veil or invocation of under
> section 69A of the Act in the hands of the assessee company. Reliance is
> placed on the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of CIT v.
> Five Vision Promoters (P) Ltd. reported in 380 ITR
> 289\.
ii) As far as the losses in the hands of the investor (USBV) on account of
subsequent repurchase is concerned, the same is also irrelevant as it is not
the case of the revenue that such losses have benefited the assesee or its
group companies in any manner. On the contrary, presuming but not admitting
that the losses so incurred by the investor (USBV) are not genuine in that
case also the appropriate recourse would be non allowance of such losses, if
it is claimed in the hands of the investor (USBV) and in no manner could make
the ―good money‖ as ―bad money‖ received on subscription of shares.
10.2 It is also submitted that the decision of USBV/NBCU to exit from the
company M/s NNIH was based on the fact that entertainment business in India
was based on the reasons that the business of NDTV Imagine Group has suffered
huge losses and to revive the same the fresh equity infusion was required. It
is a fact that the entire business of NDTV Imagine Group was later on sold by
NNPLC at a total consideration of USD 7,34,85,427 to Turner Asia Pacific
Ventures after due negotiation which included consideration to be paid to
minority  268 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, stakeholder amounting to USD
66,73,551 . The disclosure to that effect was also made (below the note on re-
purchase of stake from USBV) in the Annual Report of the Group for FY 2009-10
which read as under:-
> ―...The Company and NDTV Networks Plc, on 8 December 2009, entered into an
> agreement with Turner Asia Pacific Ventures, Inc. ("TAPV") for the sale of
> controlling stake in Turner General Entertainment Networks India Limited
> (Formerly NDTV Imagine Limited - "NDTV Imagine").
> Pursuant to the said agreement, NDTV Networks Plc, on 23 February 2010
> ("Closing Date"), transferred to TAPV 12,638,592 shares representing 85.68%
> of the issued and paid up equity share capital of NDTV Imagine on the
> Closing date resulting in a decrease of NDTV networks Plc's stake in NDTV
> Imagine from 90.68% to 5% for a cash consideration aggregating to US$ 73.48

11 The learned counsel for the revenue has referred to para 68 of judgment of
Apex Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings BV vs. UOI reported
in 341 ITR 1.
269
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 11.1 It is submitted that the observations
of the Apex Court in paras 67 and 68 has absolutely no application to the
facts of the instant case. In the said case, the issue involved was whether
the transaction of sale of shares outside India was a bonafide transaction
and, if the answer to the question was affirmative, whether the assessee would
be liable to tax in India in respect of the transfer of shares under the head
‗capital gains'.
11.2 It is submitted that the issue involved however in the instant appeal as
to whether the assessee is liable to be assessed in respect of the amount
received on issue of shares by its subsidiary to another unrelated company M/s
Universal Studios International BV, who has made investment in acquiring the
shares and has so admitted to have made investment. It is thus submitted that
the issue involved in the two cases are different.
11.3 It was held by the Apex Court in the said case that, if the transaction
is between two independent companies, the ‗look at' theory is to be applied
instead of ‗look through theory. It is thus submitted that look at theory had
to be followed in respect of instant transaction of investment and acquisition
of shares between independent and unrelated legal entities. It is submitted
that the efforts of the authorities to hold the transaction to be ‗sham' is
based on their appreciation which is not only unsupported by evidence but
following the look through' theory.
11.4 It is added here that a complete reading of the above judgments would
only shows that in order to lift corporate veil, it needs to established
beyond doubt that the transaction in question is taxable in the charging
section of the Act and the taxes were avoided by the group by interposing the
subsidiaries; which has not been done and, can be neither established.
270
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 11.5 It is further submitted that the
assumption and action of the revenue of lifting the corporate veil in respect
of the foreign subsidiaries which are incorporated and governed by the laws of
their respective countries and had treaty protection is in complete defiance
of the decision in the case of UOI vs. Azadi Bachao Andolan reported in 263
ITR 706.
12 Further even the contention as to lifting of corporate veil the same is
also not tenable.. It is submitted that the fact that shares had been acquired
by Universal Studios International BV when it paid consideration cannot be
disputed. It is submitted that Universal Studios International BV has not
merely confirmed the investment but has also established source of funding of
investment thus whether such shares were acquired of assessee company or of
subsidiary cannot be any ground to enable the revenue to lift the corporate
veil.
12.1 The appellant most respectfully submits that the contention of learned
counsel for revenue are flimsy and vague and also in disregard of explanation
tendered by the appellant company. The appellant company has established that
transaction of issue of shares by its subsidiary was a genuine transaction. It
was submitted that M/s. Universal Studios International BV, an independent
company incorporated in Netherlands had under a shareholder agreement acquired
26% stake in NDTV PLC UK at an aggregate consideration. It is respectfully
submitted that the revenue has completely ignored and overlooked the fact that
the assessee company or its subsidiary had no role to play and the decision of
investment was of an independent company. The revenue has failed to appreciate
that the said company is subsidiary of GE group, one of the largest companies
of the world. It is thus submitted that the of the revenue that contention of
the learned counsel of the assessee had sought to explain the share capital
receipt  271 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, of Rs. 642.54 crores through
lengthy and circuitous transactions and commercial substance/economic
rationale for which have not been satisfactorily explained lacks credence or
any merit.
13 It is well settled rule of law that the prudency and commercial decision
can alone be taken by a business men and It is also a settled law that it is
the prerogative of the businessman to organize its affairs in a manner best
suited to it and the revenue authority cannot step into the shoes of the
businessman and it is not for the revenue to attack a transaction on the
ground that the same was imprudent and thereafter to record the finding that
the same was sham. Attention in this regard is invited to the following
decisions:
         i)     288 ITR 1 (SC) S.A. Builders Ltd. vs. CIT
         ii)    345 ITR 421 (Del) CIT vs. EKL Appliances Ltd
14 In nutshell, the appellant's submission is that revenue overlooks
fundamental evidence furnished by appellant company. In the present case, it
is an undisputed fact and admitted by the AO/DRP that NBC Universal Inc, (a
leading and an independent Group and the Joint Venture of the GE group)
through its group company, Universal Studios International BV, subscribed to
new shares amounting to USD 150 Mn (Rs. 642.54 crores) in a NDTV Group Company
namely NDTV Networks International Holdings BV (NNIH) (a company incorporated
as per the laws of Netherlands and resident of that country) on May 23, 2008\.
It is also undisputed that investee had issued shares to USBV, a subsidiary of
NBCU, a world-wide-known company, engaged in entertainment business, which had
duly confirmed the transaction of acquisition of 31.4% stake in the investee
company. It is also quite true that, by so doing, it acquired indirect 26%
stake in NDTV Networks, PLC, UK (hereinafter referred to as ―NNPLC‖); however,
no interest whatsoever had been acquired directly or indirectly in the  272
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, appellant company. It has not been shown by
any material whatsoever that USBV had not acquired the shares or paid the said
sum to NNIH without any consideration.
15 It is thus submitted that the fact that claim that group companies either
allegedly did not carry on any business or that they existed only for a short
duration cannot be regarded as any valid basis unless until it could have been
established that, such companies were either not incorporated in law or was a
dummy concern of the appellant company. In any case, admittedly the
shareholder of M/s NDTV Networks International Holdings BV was M/s NDTV
Networks BV, who had acquired all the shares of M/s NDTV Networks
International Holdings BV. It is submitted that M/s NDTV Networks BV, is a
company incorporated on 9.1.2008 in Netherland. It is submitted that, it is
also on record that the said company is an investment company. It is also
undisputed fact that there has been no finding or adverse observation that
either under the Income Tax Act or any other Act that such company was dummy
or non-existing company.
16 It is also submitted that it is well accepted that a subsidiary and its
holding company are distinct and separate entities. They are subject to income
tax on the profits derived by them on standalone basis, irrespective of their
actual independence and regardless of whether the profits are reserved and
distributed to shareholders/participants. It is well settled law that holding
and its subsidiary are totally separate and distinct taxpayers.
17 The appellant also seeks to add that the assessment for NDTV for AY 2010-11
was completed after due enquiries including enquiries through FT & TR from
Netherland tax authority and no adverse inference was drawn with respect to

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
6\. The facts of the case regarding the addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/- are
that during the year under consideration, New Delhi Television Ltd. (NDTV),
along with four of its subsidiaries namely NDTV BV, NDTV Networks BV (NNBV),
NDTV Networks International Holdings BV (NNIH) and NDTV Networks Plc (NNPLC),
had entered into an agreement dated 23.05.2008 with NBC Universal Inc. (NBC)
and Universal Studios International BV (USBV). As a result, an amount of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- (US $150 million) was received during the year by NNIH. The
amount was received on account of subscription of 915,498 shares into NDTV
Networks International Holdings BV equivalent to 26% effective indirect stake
in NDTV Networks Plc.
7\. It is further noticed that taking into account the consideration of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- for 915,498 shares, the sale value per share thus comes to Rs.
7,015.05 per share. The face value of share of NNIH at the relevant time was
around $ 1 per share, i.e. equivalent to Rs. 45/- to Rs. 50/- per share
approx.
8\. The above sale value was despite the fact that neither NNIH nor NNPLC were
having any business activities. NNIH was a holding company and NNPLC was
incorporated to promote the interests of NNIH and other group companies. NNPLC
did not have any business activities. It had no fixed assets and there was no
rent paid. NNPLC did not even have any employee in UK and the only employee in
NNPLC was Mr. Vikramaditya Chandra, who was designated as CEO of this company.
However, Mr. Chandra was also based in India only. Apart from incorporation in
UK, NNPLC had no presence in UK. The address of NNPLC in UK was that of the
Company Secretary dealing with its tax matters. Most of the Directors of NNPLC
were Indians and the audit report of NNPLC was signed at Gurgaon in India. The
authorized share capital of NNPLC was only about Rs. 47 lacs. NNPLC had
declared loss of Rs. 8.67 crores for the year ending 31.03.2009. The
subscription of a  276 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, share of the
value around Rs. 50/- per share by USBV was @ Rs. 7,015/- per share, i.e. 140
times of the face value.
9\. It is also pertinent to record that before purchasing the subscription,
NBCU did not even obtain any independent valuation from a third party. Vide
reply dated 30.03.2013, NDTV has admitted and confirmed that no independent
valuation report for determining the value of shares of NNIH was obtained. The
subscription price is stated to be ―a negotiated price arrived between the
parties based on proposed business potential and business forecast and
projections‖. Since no prudent businessman will purchase the shares of a paper
company at a price, which was more than 140 times of the face value without
any credible valuation, the transaction was held as a part of scheme of
routing own fund of the assessee company in the assessment order.
10\. It was observed during the assessment proceedings that subsequently,
during the immediately succeeding FY 2009-10, the very same shares were bought
back by NDTV BV for Rs. 58.08 crores @ Rs. 634.17 per share. If the
transactions were not sham, how could the same shares having face value of Rs.
50/- per share approx. be issued @ Rs. 7015.05 per share and further bought
back @ Rs. 634.17 per share. That also is claimed in a situation when the
issue of shares and the repurchase of shares are by an entity and its
immediate subsidiary respectively. The transaction resulted in a claim of loss
amounting to Rs. 584.45 crores for USBV and simultaneously resulted in an
introduction of undisclosed income of Rs. 642.54 crores in the books of
accounts of the NDTV group. As already recorded, no independent valuation was
ever carried out by the group companies or by the USBV and the issue rate as
well as the repurchase rate are claimed to be solely based on estimates and
business projections. It is pertinent to mention that although the agreement
dated 23.05.2008 stipulated a 5 Year Business Plan, which involved annual
review and the 1st annual review was scheduled to be carried  277 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, out before the end of financial year 2009-10 on
31.03.2010. However, even before the 1st annual review could take place, the
shares were allegedly bought back by NDTV Networks BV without any review of
progress of business plan and without any valuation carried out by either
party. These facts made it evident during the assessment proceedings that the
transaction was not genuine.
11\. The whole transaction thus had no commercial purpose or economic
substance and its purpose was merely to evade tax and to constitute sham,
colorable or bogus transactions with the pretense of corporate and commercial
trading and in such circumstances, the corporate veil was therefore pierced
while making the assessment of the assessee company. Once the corporate veil
was lifted in the context of the impugned transaction in the present case, the
clear facts emerging regarding the transaction revealed that the transaction
was engineered to result in claim of loss to USBV and corresponding routing of
the assessee's own undisclosed money through its subsidiary. This finding has
been confirmed by the DRP.
12\. While confirming the above findings, the DRP has specifically observed
that the impugned transaction was sham and engineered to bring unexplained
money of Rs. 642.54 crore by way of routing through a complex corporate
structure, which lacked any commercial substance. The observations of the DRP
in this regard are reproduced below :
> ―5.16 DRP has carefully considered the entire gamut of transaction and is of
> the opinion that the structure of holding/ subsidiary companies and the
> transaction as narrated above, without any commercial substance, do warrant
> lifting the corporate veil to identify the true nature of the transaction.
> Though AO in his remand report has said that the money has not been recorded
> in the books of assessee, after lifting the corporate veil, the DRP finds
> that in this case a sum of Rs.
278
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 642,54,22,000/- has been found credited in
the books of assessee/ its subsidiary for the previous year (FY 2008-09) under
consideration. Though the assessee has sought to explain the above amount
through the lengthy and circuitous transactions, the commercial substance/
economic rationale for such transaction has not been satisfactorily explained.
Assessee's theory of having sold a "Dream" to the investor has not been
substantiated by any credible evidence as no details have been filed
whatsoever for the so called business projections and the basis for
computation of the sale price of the share at the astronomical price of Rs.
7,015/- which is 159 times of its face value of Rs. 45/-. Needless to mention
that the subject company whose shares were sold was incurring huge losses and
there was hardly any worthwhile business to justify the above sale price.
Interestingly, the assessee/ subsidiaries have again repurchased the same
share in the very next financial year at the price of Rs. 634.17 per share
totalling Rs. 58 crores. Here also no details/ justification has been given by
the assessee as to how the above buy back price was fixed by the assessee when
the so called "Dream" went bust, as being claimed by assessee. What was the
justification for the assessee to buy back the shares of nearly defunct and
own subsidiary company at a value which was more than 12 times of the face
value. The totality of the transaction clearly lead to the inescapable
conclusion that the entire transaction of sale & subsequent buy back of shares
was a "sham" transaction entered into by the assessee with the sole motive of
introducing Rs. 642,54,22,000/- in its books and providing loss of Rs. 584.46
crores to Universal Studios BV Netherlands.
5.16.1. In view of the facts and finding as mentioned above and taking the
totality of the picture into consideration, it  279 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, is held that assessee has brought an amount of Rs.
642,54,22,000/- being unexplained money in to its books through its subsidiary
NDTV Networks BV Netherlands. It is pertinent to mention that, as per the
admission of the assessee the above subsidiary has been subsequently
liquidated, which shows that the same was floated only to create a front for
introducing the above amount.‖ [Emphasis supplied]
13\. From the above, it is evident that there is a finding arrived at in the
assessment order regarding creation of a façade in the nature of complex
corporate structure and routing of money through sham transactions using this
structure and this finding has been confirmed by the DRP as narrated above.
Findings during the course of penalty proceedings
14\. Copy of agreement dated 23.05.2008 filed during the course of assessment
proceedings was not reliable evidence 14.1 During the assessment proceedings
for AY 2009-10, the assessee company filed copy of agreement dated 23.05.2008
in respect of alleged transaction of subscription by USBV in the shares of
NNIH, however, this document had no evidentiary value. It was a photo copy,
which was neither apostle certified nor was signed by any of the parties on
each page nor it was signed by all the parties even on the same page. Further,
the impugned agreement was not even signed by CA Holding CV, Bermuda, which
was the actual parent company of USBV. Even the terms and conditions of the
agreement were not complied with, because the agreement dated 23.05.2008
stipulated a 5 Year Business Plan, which involved annual review and the 1 st
annual review was scheduled to be carried out before the end of financial  280
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, year 2009-10 on 31.03.2010. However, even
before the 1st annual review could take place, the shares were allegedly
bought back by NDTV Networks BV without any review of progress of business
plan and without any valuation carried out by either party. The celerity with
which the shares were bought back without waiting for even the 1st review
makes it evident that the agreement was not genuine and there was no intention
to comply with the said agreement.
15\. Parent company of USBV is in Bermuda and not in USA 15.1 It is pertinent
to mention that NDTV had represented throughout before the AO, the DRP and the
ITAT that NBC Universal Inc., USA (―NBCU‖) is the parent company of Universal
Studios International BV (―USBV‖), which invested US $ 150 million (INR
642,54,22,000) in subscription of shares of NDTV Networks International
Holdings BV (―NNIH‖). However, this is found to be factually incorrect. The
correct position is that 100% of shares of USBV were held by NBCU Dutch
Holding (Bermuda) Limited, which was holding them in its capacity as General
Managing Partner of CA Holding CV, Bermuda. It is pertinent to point out that
the parent company in Bermuda was not even a party to the agreement for
subscription of shares of NNIH by USBV.
15.2 Perusal of Annual Report of Universal Studios International BV for the
year 2008 reveals that the parent company of USBV is NBCU Dutch Holding
(Bermuda) Limited, which is holding the shares of USBV acting in its capacity
as General Managing Partner of CA Holding CV Bermuda. The Annual Report
mentions as under :-
―The authorised share capital amounts to EUR 2,268,900 (2007: EUR 2,268,900)
and consists of 5,000 shares (2007: 5,000 shares) of EUR 453.78 each.

All shares are held by NBCU Dutch Holding (Bermuda) Limited acting in its
capacity as General Managing Partner of CA Holding CV, Bermuda.‖ [Emphasis
supplied]
16\. Money introduced as share application money and securities premium
transferred to NDTV in the form of dividend 16.1 NNIH was also a shell company
100% owned by NDTV. It had no assets, employee, business or commercial
activities. The only asset was the direct ownership of shell company NDTV
Networks BV and indirect ownership of another shell company NNPLC. The entire
capital of NNIH was a mere Rs. 12 lacs invested by NDTV. Inspite of this, NNIH
was able to issue fresh shares of the value of Rs. 6 lacs and was able to sell
those fresh shares of Rs. 6 lacs value at an astronomical share premium of Rs.
642.48 crores received from USBV, the subsidiary of an entity based in tax
haven jurisdiction Bermuda. In another surprise move, immediately after
receipt of money ostensibly in lieu of fresh shares, NNIH declared dividend
out of its securities premium account terming it as ‗freely distributable
reserves' and distributed dividend amounting to Rs. 643.35 crore to NDTV
Networks BV, which was 68.60% shareholder, whereas no dividend was distributed
to USBV, which was 31.40% shareholder and which had brought the entire money
of Rs. 642.54 crore into NNIH.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 16.2 In this regard, it is pertinent to
mention that the statement of Mr. KVL Narayan Rao, Director of the assessee
company and the then Group CEO, was recorded on oath u/s 131 of the Act on
23.07.2015, copy of which is enclosed. In this statement, in response to
question no. 3, when asked about the rationale of incorporation of plethora of
foreign subsidiaries, he admitted that the foreign subsidiaries were
incorporated to circumvent the restriction imposed by Indian regulations,
which confined the foreign direct investment in news channel companies to a
maximum of 26%. No other rationale could be provided by him for creation of
these many foreign subsidiaries, all like NNPLC without any commercial
activities and without any employee or assets, except stating that it was on
the advice of experts and for efficiencies. The explanation given by Mr. Rao
regarding the objective of defeating the bar of 26% in news channels is not
plausible, because the terms of agreement and subsequent events reveal that
the fund of USD 150 million was introduced in companies connected with
entertainment channels and no fund was introduced in any news channel company.
Now if the fund was to be introduced in non-news companies only (like NDTV
Imagine Limited, in which 100% FDI was permissible), then there was no bar in
bringing the fund directly through FDI into India. This shows the inherent
fallacy of the argument raised by Mr. Rao and also exhibits the lack of any
commercial purpose or economic substance behind creation of cobweb of foreign
subsidiaries. Even otherwise, regulations restricting FDI cannot be flouted by
taking recourse to a well-planned scheme for both routing of money and
circumventing the FDI regulations. It is a settled proposition of law that
what cannot be done directly, is not permissible to be done obliquely, meaning
thereby, whatever is prohibited by law to be done, cannot legally be effected
by an indirect and circuitous contrivance.
16.3 Further, Mr. Rao also admitted in replies to question no. 13, 15 and 16
that no valuation was ever carried out in respect of value of shares of NNIH,
neither at the time of alleged subscription by UCBV nor at the time of buyback
283 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, by NDTV Networks BV. The alleged
purpose of the impugned transaction of introduction of funds of USD 150
million by USBV in NNIH was stated to be acquisition of effective indirect
stake of 26% in NNPLC. As discussed in para 8 above, NNPLC was a paper company
having no worth. In his statement, Mr. Rao fairly admitted in response to
question no. 13 that NNPLC got a value of USD 400 million, when ComVentures
(now Fuse+ Capital) invested USD 20 million for 5% stake in NNPLC. It is thus
clear that even the value ascribed to NNPLC was not based on any real worth,
rather, it was a mathematical value, and the transaction of infusion of USD 20
million in NNPLC was an instrument for creating such artificial value. By
infusion of USD 20 million corresponding to 5% of shares of NNPLC,
mathematically taking the multiplier of 20, the value of NNPLC was
artificially put at USD 400 million, apparently in order to make a ground for
larger infusion of funds, as actually happened subsequently. However, this
does not go to create the actual value in NNPLC. This has already been so held
in the TPO's order and the reassessment order for AY 2007-08.
16.4 It is pertinent to mention that during the penalty proceedings, statement
of Mr. Sanjay Dutt, Director, M/s. Quantum Securities Private Limited was
recorded on oath u/s 131 of the Act on 09.07.2015. Copy of his statement is
enclosed. Mr. Sanjay Dutt is the person, who along with Mr. Sanjay Jain was
hired as Financial Consultants/Advisors for the impugned corporate
structuring. His credibility is established from his statement that he had
family relations with Dr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy for over 30 years
and he studied with Mr. Vikramaditya Chandra, Group CEO in Doon School during
the period 1977-1980 and he along with his family and associate companies held
shares of NDTV ranging from 100 to 17,00,000 in number at various times and in
FY 2006-07, such shareholding was of the value of more than Rs. 70 crore and
that he was approached by Dr. Prannoy Roy for the task of corporate
structuring. He also stated that he was part of core group led by Mr. Vikram
Chandra, in active consultation with PWC and  284 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, KPMG, which also included the Roys and Mr. Rao and this group
was referred to as ‗Nines'.
16.5 Mr. Dutt has stated that he along with Mr. Sanjay Jain quit when he
became aware that the real purpose was to route the money without any
intention of paying taxes and in violation of the various legal provisions. In
support of his averments, he has also furnished copies of emails, as described
in his statement also, which are reproduced below :-

As a consequence of this successful closing of the partnership with NBCU
group, the parent company NDTV Ltd and it's wholly owned subsidiaries now have
access to funds of US $150 mn which gives it the flexibility to use for any
opportunities in the future including acquisitions, expansion in the news
space, or in the beyond-news space as and when they arise.‖
(vii) Mail dated 22.05.2008 at 05:30 PM from Mrs. Radhika Roy to Mr. KVL
Narayan Rao, Dr. Prannoy Roy & others :
―Subject: RE: Press Announcements - Final ? Dear Narayan,  288 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, But this doesn't really address prannoy's
concerns arising from our earlier communication and it would be a pity to miss
this opportunity to correct any misconceptions. Just to remind you prannoy's
four points below:
"1. Everyone thought the money was to be put into Networks ... As a result we
got no shareholder value for the Rs 600 crs in NDTV
2\. It's very important to state that the money is not in Networks ...But in
NDTV ... As this affects the valuation analysts give to the deal... And it's a
big boost if they know it's not in Networks and it is in NDTV ... I know we
can't say stake sale (which it is not anyway)... But we do need to clarify
that the money is not in Networks‖ [Emphasis supplied] 16.6 From the above, it
is evident that even on 22.05.2008, i.e. a day in advance of the date of
alleged agreement, it was clear to all that the money introduced through USBV
was not at all an investment to be made by USBV, rather, it was a façade
created to introduce the money amounting to Rs. 600 crore in NDTV by showing
it as investment, immediately converting it to dividend, distributing dividend
to NDTV subsidiary only to the exclusion of the other shareholder and then to
route it in a circuitous manner through a cobweb of foreign subsidiaries till
it finally reached NDTV. The valuation for the subsequent buyback by NDTV
group for Rs. 58 crore in October, 2009 was also evidently based on an
adjusted figure of Rs. 42.54 crore (received over and above Rs. 600 crore)
after giving the effect of forex fluctuation, etc. 16.7 Thus, the real nature
of transaction was actively and deliberately concealed under a thorough,
methodical and calculated planned strategy.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
17\. Money is routed back into NDTV through complex cobweb of sham
subsidiaries abroad 17.1 Pursuant to INR 643.35 crore transferred by NNIH to
NDTV Networks BV in the form of dividend, NDTV Networks BV further transferred
money as under :-
> Trail 1  Out of Rs. 643.35 crore received, NDTV Networks BV invested INR
> 389 crore in NDTV (Mauritius) Media Limited, a 100% subsidiary of NDTV 
> NDTV (Mauritius) Media Limited invested Rs. 387.59 crore in NDTV Studios
> Limited on 29.09.2008 [NDTV (Mauritius) Media Limited merged in NDTV One
> Holdings Limited, Mauritius on 30.09.2011]  NDTV Studios Limited merged in
> NDTV w.e.f. 01.04.2010 Trail 2  Out of Rs. 643.35 crore received, NDTV

> Limited on 30.09.2011  NDTV One Holdings Limited merged in NDTV on
> 02.11.2012 Conscious, deliberate and well planned attempt to conceal
> particulars of income
18\. From the above, it is evident that the funds amounting to USD 150
million, which was the assessee company's own unexplained money, were
introduced in NNIH through USBV under a pre-meditated and well planned
strategy, taking all factors into account so that the real transaction is not
detected by the tax authorities. The mail dated 21.05.2008 written by Mr.
Vivek Mehra (PWC) to Dr. Prannoy Roy is an unambiguous advice to Dr. Roy  290
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, to conceal the true import of the
transaction and not to mention that NDTV was receiving the 150 million as
dividend or otherwise. It is interesting to observe that even before the
inception of shareholding of USBV in NNIH on 23.05.2008, the payment of
dividend exclusively to NDTV was fixed. Another mail dated 22.05.2008 written
by Mr. Vivek Mehra (PWC) to Dr. Prannoy Roy honestly cautions Dr. Roy that the
problem could become worse if NDTV gave a handle to the tax authorities.
18.1 It is pertinent to mention that all agreements, whether pertaining to
alleged subscription of stake by USBV in NNIH or alleged buyback by NDTV
Networks BV, are invariably signed by NDTV itself. As the other companies
signing the agreement are mere paper companies and only the assessee company
is a real company, therefore, it is clear that the actual party is the
assessee company only and the paper companies are only namesakes.
18.2 This proves it beyond doubt that the transaction, which was a colorable
device as explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of McDowell & Co.
Ltd. V. CTO [154 ITR 148 (SC)], was a conscious, deliberate and pre- meditated
attempt aimed at tax evasion to conceal the assessee company's own unexplained
income. The assessee company was always aware of the untrue façade to be
created through this sham transaction and was also aware that the true facts
could be discovered by the tax authorities. Being so aware, the assessee
company deliberately and under the expert advice of PWC chose to conceal the
true facts.
19\. Facts concealed by the assessee 19.1 It is observed that the assessee
company has concealed the following facts :-
> (i) It has been concealed that the parent company of USBV was CA Holding CV
> Bermuda. There is not even a single reference to the Bermuda parent in the
> impugned agreement dated  291 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
> 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 23.05.2008
> entered into between the complete chain of parent and all intervening
> subsidiaries on the one hand and NBCU and USBV on the other hand.
(ii) It has been concealed that immediately after introduction of money
amounting to Rs. 642.54 crore in NNIH, NNIH declared and paid dividend of Rs.
643.35 crore and this dividend was entirely paid to NDTV Networks BV, in
exclusion of the other shareholder USBV, which had brought in the entire money
of Rs. 642.54 crore as share premium. Instead, the assessee company created a
façade of investment by USBV though knowing fully well that money was to be
introduced in the form of dividend exclusive to NDTV group.
(iii) It has been concealed that the actual ownership and control over the
money amounting to Rs. 642,54,22,000/- was always with the assessee company
only, which introduced this money by creating complex cobweb of sham
subsidiaries in Netherlands and UK and later routed this money through sham
subsidiaries in Mauritius until the money was ultimately ploughed back into
the assessee company in India.
(iv) It is observed that not only during the assessment proceedings but in the
present penalty proceedings also, the assessee company has continued to
conceal the true facts. This is apparent from the statement of Mr. KVL Narayan
Rao, Director as discussed in para 16.2 above, wherein Mr. Rao has given the
rationale for creation of foreign subsidiaries as being the restriction
imposed in FDI in news channel companies, whereas actually the funds
introduced through foreign subsidiaries were meant for non-news companies
only, which could be  292 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, accomplished
through obtaining direct FDI into these companies in India.
19.2 Furnishing of inaccurate particulars by the assessee
(i) The assessee company has furnished documents, which had no evidentiary
value, because the agreement dated 23.05.2008 is not signed by all the parties
on the same page, the copy of agreement given is not apostle certified and the
Bermuda parent of USBV is not even a party to this agreement.
20\. Conclusion 20.1 In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case,
which involve active, deliberate and planned concealment and misrepresentation
of facts, this is a fit case, which merit levy of penalty @ 200% of the tax
sought to be evaded. Accordingly, you are requested to show cause as to why
penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act read with Explanation 1 thereof may not be
imposed upon the company for concealment of the particulars of its income in
respect of the impugned addition of Rs. 642,54,22,000/-.
20.2 Similarly, regarding the other three additions as mentioned in para 4
above, you are requested to show cause as to why penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the
Act read with Explanation 1 thereof @ 100% may not be imposed upon the company
for concealment of the particulars of its income in respect of these
additions.
21\. Quantum of penalty 21.1 In accordance with the above, the quantum of
proposed penalty in the case of the assessee company will be as under :-

97\. The ld DR referred in detail the various issues raised in the penalty
proceedings wherein the statement of the Director of the company was recorded.
98\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The short issue
involved in this ground is that by agreement dated 23.05.2008 titled as
agreement for the subscription of shares in NDTV Networks International B.V.
by Universal Studios International B.V. it was agreed that a sum of US$150
million would be a consideration for purchase of shares. Accordingly, 915498
shares were subscribed and therefore, the price per share as Rs. 7015.05
shares. The above subscription money was received by NDTV Networks
International Holdings B.V. Subsequently, vide agreement dated 14.10.2009
Titled as agreement for the sale and purchase of shares in NDTV BV between
Universal Studios International BV as the seller and  294 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NDTV Networks BV as the purchaser of the shares
of NDTV BV. According to that agreement it was stated that seller has
subscribed for the sale of shares pursuant to subscription agreement dated
23.05.2008 and now the seller wishes to sell and the purchaser wishes to
purchase the sale shares. The consideration of shares was US$12527250 whose
approximate valuation is Rs. 634.17 per share. Therefore, the shares which
were purchased by Universal Studios International BV on 23.05.2008 for US$150
million (Rs. 6,42,54,22,000/-) were being sold on 14.10.2009 for US$ 12527250
(RS. 58.08 crores). Meaning thereby, that the shares were purchased by the
investor on 23.05.2008 @ Rs. 7015.05 per share were sold on 14.10.2009 @Rs.
634.17 per share. During the course of assessment proceedings it was submitted
that determination of the price for the purchase of share on 23.05.2008 was an
agreed price between the two parties and therefore there was no valuation
report. However, in the agreement dated 23.05.2008 for the subscription of
share clause No.6 provided for an option to the investor for exit. According
to clause 6.2 of that agreement at the time of exist the fair market value of
the share was required to be determined according to clause No. 6.8. However,
clause No. 6.8 was only referring to the methodology of the appointment. It
was explained by assessee that consideration at the time of exist was also the
price requested by the seller of US$25 million, which was bifurcated into
12527250 with respect to the shares and balance 12472750 with respect to the
receivable. Therefore the total consideration for shares and receivable was
US$25 million. To understand the above transaction it is necessary to note the
structure of the subsidiary companies formed by the assessee for above
transactions.
99\. The assessee an Indian resident company formed on 09.01.2008 its 100%
subsidiary in Netherland in the name of NDTV Networks BV (NNBV). On 10.04.2008
the assessee where the investor is Universal Studios International BV
(USBV)formed another company in the name of NDTV Network International
Holdings BV (NNIH) in Netherland. In NNIH the 68.6 % holding was of NNBV and
31.4% holding was of USBV of Netherland. The assessee has another company in
the name of NDTV BV in the Netherland, which was formed on 28.12.2006 wherein
10% share holding was with NDTV assessee, and 90% holding was of NNIH. The
assessee another company which was formed on 30.11.2006 in the name of NDTV
295 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Network PLC, UK wherein 90% share
holding was owned by NDTV BV and balance 8 percent were held by others as ESOP
etc. The NDTV Network PLc was having different share holding in five operating
companies in India. The above structure can be pictorially presented as under:
NDTV (Assessee) India NBC Universal 100% Inc 100% NDTV Network BV,
Netherlands(NNBV) 09-01-2008 10% 50% 25-03-2011-Liquidation 68.6% Emerging

Convergence 13-12-2006 21-05-2006 13-12-2006 13-12-2006 NGEN 29-08-2006 India
100\. From the above corporate structure it is apparent that assessee is in
India whereas NNBV, NNIH, and NDTV BV are in Netherland Jurisdiction and NDTV
Network PLc  296 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014
(AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, In UK . The NNBV was
liquated on 25.03.2011, NNIH was merged with NDTV BV on 01.04.2009, NDTV BV
was merged with NNBV on 15.10.2010 and NNBV was liquidated on 25.03.2011. from
the above structure. It is apparent that three companies in the Netherland
Jurisdiction were formed by the assessee and all of them were liquated on
25.03.2011. Therefore, the appellant structure is that two companies were
formed in Netherland on 09.01.2008 and 10.04.2008 and by 25.03.2011 all the
three companies in the Netherland jurisdiction were liquated after merger and
liquidation.
101\. After understanding the above structure it is also relevant to note that
a sum of Rs.
2642.24 crores (US$150 million) were received by NNIH by share subscription
agreement dated 23.05.2008 for 31.4 % stake bifurcating the above
consideration of share capital of Rs. 6 lakhs and share premium of Rs. 642.54
cores. As subsequently, the NNIH in which the money was received was merged
with NDTV BV. Therefore it is apparent at the time of repurchase of the shares
i.e. 14.10.2009 when share purchase agreement was executed NNIH not in
existence but was merged with NDTV BV. Therefore, on the date of agreement of
the sale and purchase i.e. 14.10.2009 NNIH is not in existence as it is merged
with NDTV BV and therefore the shares of NDTV BV (amalgamated company) were
repurchased by NNBV. Apparently at that time the shareholders of NDTV BV were
NNBV and USBV. Therefore, NNBV purchased from USBV on 14.10.2009 shares for
Rs. 58 crores which were acquired by USBV on 23.05.2008 by making subscription
in NNIH. To substantiate the transaction the assessee submitted the copies of
the agreement such as shareholders agreement and share subscription agreement
dated 23.05.2008. Copies of the bank account of the investor company i.e.
USBV, the annual accounts of the investee company i.e. NNIH, the confirmation
letter from USBV, annual report of USBV to substantiate the above transaction.
The assessee also stated that the parent company of USBV is NBC Universal Inc.
and NBC Universal is a part of GE Group (General Electric) which is as
submitted by the assessee was one of the largest global business group and
hence it was claimed by the assessee that identity and creditworthiness of the
transaction was proved.
102\. However, the case of the revenue is that the above transaction entered
into by the assessee through creating a complex structure of cobweb of
subsidiaries and  297 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, routing the
money in India or under the ownership of the assessee is sham and ingenuine
transaction. The revenue has also alleged that subsidiaries created in the
Netherland Jurisdiction are mere paper companies, does not have any substance
and the investor company has source of funds from Bermuda which is also one of
the questionable jurisdiction. Based on the above findings recorded in the
draft assessment order, in the order of the ld DRP and the final assessment
order which resulted into the addition of Rs. 6425422000/-.
103\. Now firstly we need to examine what the company in which money is
invested is engaged in to, purposes of its formation, its activities, and its
life span and jurisdiction. We come to the financial affairs of NDTV Networks
International Holding BV (NNIH), the investee company, from the audited
accounts produced before us at page No. 652 to 665 of the paper book. The
above company was formed in Netherland Jurisdiction on 10.04.2008 and
subsequently, it was merged with another group company i.e. NDTV BV on
01.04.2009. Therefore, this company remains in existence for less than a year
and the accounts available for the audit were from 10.04.2008 to 31.03.2009.
the accounts were audited on 30.04.2009. According to the profit and loss
account of the company it earned only interest on fixed deposits of Rs. 13.33
lakhs and has an expenditure of operation and administration of Rs. 6.77
lakhs. As per profit and loss statement It has earned loss before taxes of Rs.
54.35 lakhs. The company has issued 2915498 equity shares of the face value of
Euro 0.01 each fully paid amounting to Rs. 18.40 lakhs. During the year it
earned premium of Rs. 642, 54,22,169. The share holding pattern of the company
was that 20 lakhs shares were held by NDTV Networks BV and 915498 shares were
held by USBV. Therefore, investment of NDTV Network BV in the company for 20
lakhs shares was Rs. 12.62 lakhs which is part of the issued share capital and
the USBV has invested Rs. 577000/- in equity capital and a premium of Rs.
6425422169/-. Therefore, the person who was holding 68.6 % has just invested
Rs. 12.62 lakhs and the entity who has acquired 31.4% stake has invested Rs.
642.54 crores in securities premium and Rs. 5.77 lakhs in the equity of the
company. The company in its notes to accounts in schedule 6B has mentioned
that this company was incorporated on 10.04.2008 by NDTV Network BV to create
the  298 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, corporate structure for the
global media and non-news media related business. The balance sheet was
prepared on 30.04.2009 for the period ended on 10.04.2008 to 31.03.2009 as the
company was merged on 01.04.2009. Admittedly as per the balance sheet as well
as the profit and loss account there were no business activity. There was no
explanation from the assessee for what kind of activity this company was doing
and for what reason the Netherland Jurisdiction was selected. Furthermore, in
Schedule-II to the annual accounts in the securities premium accounts of Rs.
642,54,22,169/- in the same year dividend was paid out of that security
premium amounting to Rs. 643,35,00,000/-. Therefore, the company which did not
have any business and did not have any worth but because of the share premium
collected has declared the dividend more than the security premium received by
it. It is interesting to note that at the end of the first accounting period
the company went into negative net worth having share capital of Rs. 18,40,227
and negative reserve of Rs. 38,88,870 resulting into negative net worth of Rs.
20.48 lakhs. Generally it is understood that whenever a dividend is declared
it goes to the entire share holders of the company and in the present company
as stated above 68% is held by NDTV Network BV and 31% is held by USBV.
However, looking at the note No. 7 of schedule 6B of the Act wherein it is
mentioned that during the year the company has declared dividend out of its
reserve amounting to US$150 million (Rs. 643,35,00,000/-) to NDTV Network BV
the holding company only. Meaning thereby that to the entity which has
invested Rs. 643 crores and acquired 31.4% of the equity was not paid dividend
of single rupee and from that investors sources of money the investee company
paid dividend to the company which has just invested Rs. 12 lakhs was paid
dividend of Rs. 643.35 crores in the first year of its investment. That to
when the company does not have any revenue stream. The only activity this
company has carried out is evident from note No. 5 of schedule 6B wherein it
is mentioned that during the year the company has invested in NDTV BV being
100% subsidiary of NDTV by subscribing 8820 shares of Euro 100 each equivalent
to 90% of the post issue paid up capital of NDTV BV. The value of such
investment is Rs. 56562660/- and to finance this acquisition is apparently the
company does not have money a loan of Rs. 6,00,33,600/- obtained from the NDTV
Network BV the holding company. Therefore, for making an investment in the
step  299 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, down subsidiary this company
borrowed money from its holding company. On analysis of the financial
statement of the NNIH it is apparent that this company does not have any
substance but was merely created for the purpose of issue of above shares of
Rs. 642 crores from USBV and taking away the dividend from it to the
assessee‟s group company which is 100 % owned by the assessee. Looking to the
Board of Directors of the company it is apparent that most of the directors of
assessee are the directors in this company. It is apparent that anybody
appointed from the side of investor USBV were just merely puppet directors
otherwise, they would not have allowed assessee‟s group company to be paid
dividend of such a magnitude of Rs. 643 crores to a shareholder holding 68%
without getting a single penny for 31% shareholder. It is also not clear that
how the dividend was not paid to USBV when there is a share issue deed. There
is no plausible explanation from the assessee on this issue. It creates a
suspicion that whether for all understanding the share holding of the NDTV BV
and USBV are having similar rights or not. From the conduct it appears that
they are not. Further the valuation exercise of the shares of the company was
stated to be not done, as it is a mutually agreed price based on business
potential. No such evidences were led before lower authorities or even before
us to show that whether there is any cash flow stream available, whether there
is any IPR existing with the investee company which has such a huge valuation.
There is no iota of evidences led before us. On the issue of the premium of
the shares assessee has merely done the lip services. Further it is also
stated that due diligence is not to be done by the assessee or its group
company but it is the requirement of the investor. When the assessee is ready
to produce investor before the bench but is not in a position to enquire from
the investor about any due diligence process at the time of investment, term
sheets, etc, the mere assertion of the assessee of production of investor
before us is also a hollow legal argument without any substance. Further the
ld AR has also produced the minutes of the board of directors of the company
NDTV Network PLC to show that the board of directors of the company includes
the two representatives of the NBCU group and they were actively participated
in the business decision of the company .For this the relevant minutes were
produced in paper book no VIII at page no 203 to 256 of the paper book. It is
fact that in meeting of the board of directors of NNPLC Mr. Pete  300 ITA No.

directors of that company. Subsequent to that Mrs. Roma Khanna attended the
meeting on 25 th August 2008 and in that meeting there were no strategic
decision were taken and also the annual accounts for the March 2008 were
approved. Naturally in that NBCCU has no role to play. Subsequently, on
7.11.2008 in meeting at London Mr. Pete and Mrs. Roma Khanna both attended
where the presentations were made by the board Chairman and no role is played
by those Directors. Further, in the minutes dated 27.06.2009 both the
directors attended in New Delhi and there was discussion about the funding
requirement of loan from NBCU and where it was decided to discuss a short term
loan of US$10 million to NDTV Imagine Ltd and intercompany investment were
only discussed. On the meeting held on 09.07.2009 there is no details where
and when it was held (Page No. 243). However, in those meeting further
discussion was with respect to share swap only where NBCU directors were to
revert back. The meeting held on 22.09.2009 once again there is no mention
where and when the meeting was held. Where also the funding proposal were
discussed of various verticals. In that meeting in Sl No. 26 NBCU say that it
has repeated offer to exit the business for US$25 million a sum which includes
repayment of 12.5 million$ loan and no liability of the bonds or the business.
NBCU said it was still happy to exit. Therefore, from the above board meeting
it is apparent that on 22.09.2009 the NBCU expressed its desire to exit and it
was repeated offer. Meaning thereby that NBCU wanted to exit quite earlier. It
is also not known that when originally the NBCU expressed its desire to exit.
In this in the same board meeting Mr. Pete Smith suggested that the board of
company should seek independent advice with respect to their role in view of
the difficult financial situation of the company. Because of these events it
is apparent that the board of directors of NBCU was also not interested in
being on the Board of this company. On reading of the minutes it is apparent
that there was no interest of those directors in the business of NDTV Group.
It is also apparent from the minutes that none of the directors objected to
the distribution of dividend by NNIH. The NNIH did not have any representation
in the board of that company where the decision to distribute the dividend was
taken. No rationale were produced before us for distribution of the dividend
by producing the board meeting of NNIH to exhibit the business consideration
behind declaration of dividend of Rs. 643 crores only to  301 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, NDTV Group subsidiary and not also to USBV was
holding 31% share in that company. The rationale behind formation of this
company in Netherland jurisdiction was also not placed before us despite the
DRP and ld Assessing Officer has challenged the substance of the transaction.
Netherland jurisdiction did not have any tax on the distribution of dividend
at that particular time and also there is no need of establishing the
substance in that jurisdiction. In view of this looking at the whole of the
transaction the Netherland jurisdiction was one of the best jurisdiction
internationally available to the assessee to bring somebody as a partner with
finance and to take away the funds from that company in one of its
subsidiaries and then to route it in its own books. However, we are not
concerned what are the reasons for transferring money from the original payer
through USBV to the assessee group companies and ultimately to the assessee
and it is for others to look into, our mandate is restricted to test the
chargeability of the above sum in the hands of the assessee as contended by
the Revenue. on the basis of above facts we do not reach at a conclusion
different from the decision of the ld AO and ld DRP that the investee company
did not have any substance and it is merely a ploy adopted for transferring
money from one entity to another entity which is the assessee only.
104\. Now we look at the profile of the investor company, USBV which are
placed at page No. 676 to 718 of the paper book wherein the annual accounts of
the company as on 31.12.2008 signed on 25.06.2010 were placed. This company is
wholly owned subsidiary of CA holding CV legally seated in Amsterdam,
Netherland. It belongs NBCU group which is owned 80% by General Electric
company and 20% by Vivendi. This company has participating interest in more
than 45 companies ranging from 100% to 95 % and having other participating
interest in seven companies. On looking at the shareholder equity statement of
this company it is mentioned that all shares of this company are held by NBCU
Dutch holding (Bermuda )Ltd acting in its capacity as general managing partner
of CA Holding CV Bermuda. The annual accounts were published on 10/6/2010, by
which date NNIH was already merged with NDTV BV , for such an investment there
was only a statement that there was a significant acquisition concerns an
indirect minority interest of a subsidiary company of New Delhi Television
Limited . It was further stated that this USD 150 Million investment provides
immediate access to the Indian television market. In the  302 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, whole of the report there was no reference
about the payments of dividend by NNIH but not received by this company USBV
despite being such a huge investor. Even USBV was also formed in Netherlands
jurisdiction. Further it incurs this year the loss in diminution of
participation investments of 17470 thousands USD as loss from group companies.
Therefore it is apparent that this company is mainly an investment company
formed in Netherlands as its tangible fixed assets are very low compared to
its financial assets of investments. Further, its group investments are very
rare in Netherlands but its participating interest investments are mostly in
Netherlands in non-group companies. One must take a clue that an investor who
has invested Rs 643 Crores is not aware about the merger of the investee
company and not caring about the dividend income how serious that investor is.
Further, within a short span of time of signing the board reports this company
is making an offer to sell its stake in that company for substantially lower
sum. There is no mention in the company‟s report about the activities for
exploring the access to Indian television market and there is no such
information coming from the assesse about the joint business plan which was
devised and executed. Therefore it is apparent that statements made in the
Report of board of director were just eyewash. In any way because of our
finding at the time of examining the profile of the investee company it
becomes apparent that investor is no more interested about the fate of its
investment.
105\. It is vehemently claimed by the assessee that investor in NNIH is GE
group.
However on looking at the structure of the investments in this company its
part of NBCU group of which 80 % stake is held by the GE group. There is no
reference of the amount invested in the USBV by GE group for making
investments in USBV. No details has been placed by the assessee before us or
before lower authorities except stating that the investor company is part of
GE group and that group has made investment in this company which is in turn
invested in NNIH. There is no reference about the participation of that group
in the affairs of the investing company. Therefore in absence of complete
structure of investment including the control by the directorship it cannot be
established that investor in the company is GE group. In any case credibility
and genuineness of the investments cannot be solely determined by the showing
names but only by showing the substances of  303 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the transactions. Because of our finding while examining the
profile of the investee company and investor company. It is apparent that
transaction entered into by the parties lack substance and therefore, whoever
is the party and howsoever credible it is, heavier burden is cast on them to
explain the purpose and rationale of so-called investment. In view of this we
are not swayed by the profile of the investor. It is also not an ingredient to
test the chargeability of otherwise of a receipt.
106\. Now we come to various agreements entered in to by the various entities
for the investments in NNIH and exiting from those investments .

                            business. Therefore,
                            the real fact that
                            emerges is that it is the
                            financial   transaction
                            which was the only
                            important aspect of
                            these agreements.
107\. The parties have entered into several agreements having plethora of
conditions, however, on looking into the conduct of the party it clearly
emerges to our mind that these agreements were merely created/ executed for
executing the financial transaction. The form of the transaction on reading of
the agreement shows that two groups coming together for development of the
business but the substance of the transaction is to pass money from one group
to another group by creating complex holding subsidiary structure, lengthy and
complex agreement which were never acted upon. The investment decision by the
investor was taken without any valuation report, due diligence report i.e.
financial and legal both, and the exit decision was also taken by investor
without getting its assets fairly valued. It is really unbelievable in the
corporate world that an investor behaves in that manner. It can only happen in
case the investor is not concerned with what happens with the money he invests
but only interested in completing preconceived financial transaction. It may
be possible that it may benefit both the investor as well as the investee.
However, in the present case it is certain and evident that it has definitely
benefited the investee company i.e. the subsidiary of assessee. In the present
corporate world and complex business environment courts cannot shut their eyes
and close their ears by accepting the complex cobweb of structures for tax
avoidance devices adopted like this. The time has come when the judicial
officers must understand the real intent behind various forms created by
assessee in different jurisdictions across the globe for such a dubious
financial transaction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Vodaphone
International Holdings BV Vs. Union of India 341 ITR 1 in para No. 67 and 68
has discussed the international tax aspect of holding structure as under:-

65\. In the thirteenth century, Pope Innocent IV espoused the theory of the
legal fiction by saying that corporate bodies could not be ex-communicated
because they only exist in abstract. This enunciation is the foundation of the
separate entity principle.
66\. The approach of both the corporate and tax laws, particularly in the
matter of corporate taxation, generally is founded on the abovementioned
separate entity principle, i.e., treat a company as a separate person. The
Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, in the matter of corporate taxation, is founded
on the principle of the independence of companies and other entities subject
to Income-tax. Companies and other entities are viewed as a separate person.
The Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, in the matter of corporate taxation, is
founded on the principle of the independence of companies and other entities
subject to Income-tax. Companies and other entities are viewed as economic
entities with legal independence vis-a-vis their shareholders/ participants.
It is fairly well accepted that a subsidiary and its parent are totally
distinct taxpayers. Consequently, the entities subject to Income-tax are taxed
on profits derived by them on standalone basis, irrespective of their actual
degree of economic independence and regardless of whether profits are reserved
or distributed to the shareholders/participants. Furthermore,
shareholders/participants, that are subject to (personal or corporate) Income-
tax, are generally taxed on profits derived in consideration of their
shareholding/participations, such as capital gains. Nowadays, it is fairly
well settled that for tax treaty purposes a subsidiary and its parent are also
totally separate and distinct taxpayers.
67\. It is generally accepted that the group parent company is involved in
giving principal guidance to group companies by providing general policy
guidelines to group subsidiaries. However, the fact that a parent company
exercises shareholder's influence on its subsidiaries does not generally imply
that the subsidiaries are to be deemed residents of the State in which the
309 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, parent company resides. Further, if a
company is a parent company, that company's executive director(s) should lead
the group and the company's shareholder's influence will generally be employed
to that end. This obviously implies a restriction on the autonomy of the
subsidiary's executive directors. Such a restriction, which is the inevitable
consequences of any group structure, is generally accepted, both in corporate
and tax laws. However, where the subsidiary's executive directors' competences
are transferred to other persons/bodies or where the subsidiary's executive
directors' decision making has become fully subordinate to the holding company
with the consequence that the subsidiary's executive directors are no more
than puppets then the turning point in respect of the subsidiary's place of
residence comes about. Similarly, if an actual controlling nonresident
enterprise (NRE) makes an indirect transfer through "abuse of organisation
form/legal form and without reasonable business purpose" which results in tax
avoidance or avoidance of withholding tax, then the Revenue may disregard the
form of the arrangement or the impugned action through use of non-resident
holding company, re- characterise the equity transfer according to its
economic substance and impose the tax on the actual controlling non-resident
enterprise. Thus, whether a transaction is used principally as a colourable
device for the distribution of earnings, profits and gains, is determined by a
review of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is
in the above cases that the principle of lifting the corporate veil or the
doctrine of substance over form or the concept of beneficial ownership or the
concept of alter ego arises. There are many circumstances, apart from the one
given above, where separate existence of different companies, that are part of
the same group, will be totally or partly ignored as a device or a conduit (in
the pejorative sense).
68\. The common law jurisdictions do invariably impose taxation against a
corporation based on the legal principle that the corporation is "a person"
that is separate from its members. It is the decision of the House of Lords in
Salomon v. A. Salomon and Co. Ltd. [1897] AC 22 that opened the door to  310
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the formation of a corporate group. If a
"one man" corporation could be incorporated, then it would follow that one
corporation could be a subsidiary of another. This legal principle is the
basis of holding structures. It is a common practice in international law,
which is the basis of international taxation, for foreign investors to invest
in Indian companies through an interposed foreign holding or operating
company, such as Cayman Islands or Mauritius based company for both tax and
business purposes. In doing so, foreign investors are able to avoid the
lengthy approval and registration processes required for a direct transfer
(i.e., without a foreign holding or operating company) of an equity interest
in a foreign invested Indian company. However, taxation of such holding
structures very often gives rise to issues such as double taxation, tax
deferrals and tax avoidance. In this case, we are concerned with the concept
of GAAR. In this case, we are not concerned with treaty-shopping but with the
anti-avoidance rules. The concept of GAAR is not new to India since India
already has a judicial antiavoidance rule, like some other jurisdictions. Lack
of clarity and absence of appropriate provisions in the statute and/or in the
treaty regarding the circumstances in which judicial anti-avoidance rules
would apply has generated litigation in India. Holding structures are
recognised in corporate as well as tax laws. Special purpose vehicles (SPVs)
and holding companies have a place in legal structures in India, be it in
company law, takeover code under the SEBI or even under the Income-tax law.
When it comes to taxation of a holding structure, at the threshold, the burden
is on the Revenue to allege and establish abuse, in the sense of tax avoidance
in the creation and/or use of such structure(s). In the application of a
judicial antiavoidance rule, the Revenue may invoke the "substance over form"
principle or "piercing the corporate veil" test only after it is able to
establish on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the
transaction that the impugned transaction is a sham or tax avoidant. To give
an example, if a structure is used for circular trading or round tripping or
to pay bribes then such transactions, though having a legal form, should be
discarded by applying the test of fiscal nullity. Similarly, in a case where
the Revenue finds that in a holding structure  311 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, an entity which has no commercial/business substance has been
interposed only to avoid tax then in such cases applying the test of fiscal
nullity it would be open to the Revenue to discard such inter-positioning of
that entity. However, this has to be done at the threshold. In this
connection, we may reiterate the "look at" principle enunciated in Ramsay
(supra) in which it was held that the Revenue or the court must look at a
document or a transaction in a context to which it properly belongs to. It is
the task of the Revenue/court to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction
and while doing so it has to look at the entire transaction as a whole and not
to adopt a dissecting approach. The Revenue cannot start with the question as
to whether the impugned transaction is a tax deferment/saving device but that
it should apply the "look at" test to ascertain its true legal nature (See
Craven v. White (supra) which further observed that genuine strategic tax
planning has not been abandoned by any decision of the English courts till
date). Applying the above tests, we are of the view that every strategic
foreign direct investment coming to India, as an investment destination,
should be seen in a holistic manner. While doing so, the Revenue/courts should
keep in mind the following factors : the concept of participation in
investment, the duration of time during which the holding structure exists ;
the period of business operations in India ; the generation of taxable
revenues in India ; the timing of the exit ; the continuity of business on
such exit. In short, the onus will be on the Revenue to identify the scheme
and its dominant purpose. The corporate business purpose of a transaction is
evidence of the fact that the impugned transaction is not undertaken as a
colourable or artificial device. The stronger the evidence of a device, the
stronger the corporate business purpose must exist to overcome the evidence of
a device.‖
108\. In the present case, according to us it is a clear cut case of "abuse of
organization form/ legal form and without reasonable business purpose and
therefore, no fault can be found with the order of the ld Assessing Officer/
ld DRP in charging to tax Rs. 642 crores by re-characterizing the conditions
according to its economic substance and imposing the tax on the actual
controlling Indian entity. In the present case we  312 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, do not have any doubt that the transaction used principally as a
devise for the distribution/ diversion of sum to the Indian entity on review
of all the facts circumstances surrounding the present transaction. In the
present case the beneficial owner of the money is the assessee.
109\. No doubt when it comes to taxing the real owner or beneficial owner of
the financial transaction higher burden is cast on the revenue and therefore,
revenue is duty bound to prove the money trail. According to us the revenue
has established that the money has come back to the assessee. Before us, the
revenue has also submitted a chart showing transaction-involving introduction
of Rs. 642.54 crores and the money trail how it travelled to the assessee. The
moment the amount was invested by USBV in NNIH, NNIH declared dividend of Rs.
643.35 crores to a lone shareholder despite there being other shareholders
also, to NDTV Networks BV. Therefore, Rs. 643 crores was infused in NNIH and
simultaneously they were siphoned from that company to NDTV Networks BV who is
the part of NDTV Group. At this stage itself all financial interest of USBV
and NBCU or any other group attached with the investor company has come to an
end with the single motive to only conclude the transaction by liquidating the
investment at substantial discount to give it a color of „failed investment
decision‟. The dividend received by the NDTV Network BV was transferred in to
trenches to two different companies owned by NDTV Group. A sum of Rs. 448.49
crores was invested in NDTV Mauritius Multimedia Ltd , Manutius which is 100%
subsidiary company of NDTV Ltd crores(assessee). A further sum of Rs. 254.75
crores was given as unsecured loan to NDTV network PLC which is existing in UK
jurisdiction and where 92% of shareholding is with NDTV (assessee).
Subsequently, the NDTV Mauritius Multimedia Ltd which received Rs. 448.49
crores merged with NDTV one Holding Ltd, Mauritius w.e.f September 2011 and
the amalgamated entity also the 100% subsidiary of NDTV. The NDTV one Holding
Ltd Mauritius merged with NDTV Studious ltd and NDTV Studious Ltd then merged
with NDTV (assessee) w.e.f 01.09.2012. in view of this money trail established
by the Revenue could not be controverted by the assessee. This money trail
stares so glaringly on the various complex structures created by the assessee
that without proving any substance one cannot reach to any other conclusion
but to the conclusion that series of the  313 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, transaction entered into by the assessee were to transfer Rs.
642 crores from the investor company or the owner of the investor company to
the assessee.
110\. It is interesting to note that certain emails were gathered by revenue
through enquiry during the course of penalty proceedings by examination of
some person. Such exchange of mails was recorded at para No. 6.5 of the show
cause notice issued by the ld Assessing Officer u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act.
These emails were given to the ld Assessing Officer by one Mr. Sanjay Dutt,
who was examined u/s 131 of the Act by the ld AO. These mails are pertaining
to the transaction where Mr. Sanjay Dutt is one of the recipients. The other
recipients are purportedly the highest officers of the company including the
chairman. When these mails were confronted to the assessee the reply was
submitted by the assessee vide letter undated but submitted to the Assessing
Officer on 02.11.2016. In that letter at para No. 15(c) the seven email
communication are referred and the reply of the assessee was as under:-
―15. Be that as it may, it is seen from the perusal of your notice that in the
notice dated 15.06.2016, you have referred to certain fresh evidences which
are not part of the assessment proceedings. Such evidences which have been

(d) The assessee submits that before assuming them to be valid evidence on
which reliance can be placed in the present proceedings, you may kindly
establish the genuineness, authenticity and source of the said documents so
that the assessee could made its specific submission and originals of the
above may also be made available for verification.
(e) In addition to the above, the assessee also submits that given the
peculiar facts and investigation conducted by your office and in order to make
meaningful representation, we request you to provide details of all such
material , enquiries, complaints and other evidence collected in relation to
assessment of the year in question as well as in present proceedings or advise
the assessee to seek these details under Right to Information irrespective of
the fact that whether the same is adverse to the assessee or in favour of the
assessee. The above request has been made in the interest of justice and
equity and to be considered favourably.‖
111\. On reading the reply of the assessee, it is apparent that emails are not
denied that the executives of the assessee are recipient, sender, and part of
the correspondence. The assessee has strategically avoided to comment on the
content  315 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, of the email by simply stating
that AO must establish the genuineness, authenticity and source (GAS) of the
said document so that assessee could make specific submission and originals of
the above may also be made available for verification. Had these mails were
inappropriate/ false evidence assessee would have denied them vehemently.
Instead, the assessee has asked LD AO to establish the genuineness,
authenticity, and sources of the evidence without denying it. According to us,
there is no occasion to establish the genuineness, authenticity, and sources
of the evidences unless assessee denies them. It shows that assessee is trying
to avoid answers to these evidences. We cannot fall prey to such an attitude
of the assessee and therefore in absence of any denial by the assessee the
above evidence are presumed to be true. Now we discuss the consents of the
mails as incorporated in the show cause notice issued to the assessee are
discussed as under:-
> ―16.5 Mr. Dutt has stated that he along with Mr. Sanjay Jain quit when he
> became aware that the real purpose was to route the money without any
> intention of paying taxes and in violation of the various legal provisions.
> In support of his averments, he has also furnished copies of emails, as

The problem we have it that in the last communication we created a real mess:
Thx Prannoy Dear Vivek ... Here's a first bash NDTV and NBCU successfully
closed their strategic partnership in the NDTV subsidiary NDTV Networks.
For a consideration of US $150 million, NBCU now has an indirect and effective
stake of 26 % in NDTV Networks PLC. This effective 26 % stake is held through
a proportionate stake in the holding company of NDTV Networks PLC NBCU has the
option in three years to increase their stake in the Networks PLC's holding
company to 50%. The NBCU option to  318 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
increase their stake will be at FMV (Fair Market Value) at the time the option
is exercised.
It has been agreed that management control will always remain with NDTV Ltd.
As a consequence of this successful closing of the partnership with NBCU, the
parent company NDTV Ltd now has funds of US $150 which gives it the
flexibility to use for any opportunities in the future including acquisitions,
expansion in the news space, or in the beyond- news space as and when they
arise.
The NDTV - NBCU strategic, partnership in the Networks businesses is a coming
together of two leading professional media organizations with similar ethics
and goals and promises to be a major force in the media scene in India.‖

233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT,
(vi) Mail dated 22.05.2008 at 03:43 PM from Dr. Prannoy Roy to Mr. Vivek Mehra
(PWC) & others :
―Subject: Press Announcements -- Final ?
Thanks very much Vivek ... based on our discussion over the telephone, I just
wanted to confirm that this is what you have suggested as the final version:
NDTV group and NBCU group have successfully concluded their strategic
partnership initiative for the NDTV Networks business.
By a subscription of shares for US S150 million, NBCU group now has an
effective indirect stake of 26 % in NDTV Networks PLC UK NBCU has the option
in three years to increase their stake, at the then fair market value, in the
holding company of Networks PLC to 50% with NDTV group holding an equal 50%
stake. Management control will always remain with NDTV group.
As a consequence of this successful closing of the partnership with NBCU
group, the parent company NDTV Ltd and it's wholly owned subsidiaries now have
access to funds of US $150 mn which gives it the flexibility to use for any
opportunities in the future including acquisitions, expansion in the news
space, or in the beyond-news space as and when they arise.‖
(vii) Mail dated 22.05.2008 at 05:30 PM from Mrs. Radhika Roy to Mr. KVL
Narayan Rao, Dr. Prannoy Roy & others :
―Subject: RE: Press Announcements - Final ? Dear Narayan,  320 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, But this doesn't really address prannoy's
concerns arising from our earlier communication and it would be a pity to miss
this opportunity to correct any misconceptions. Just to remind you prannoy's
four points below:
"1. Everyone thought the money was to be put into Networks ... As a result we
got no shareholder value for the Rs 600 crs in NDTV
2\. It's very important to state that the money is not in Networks ...But in
NDTV ... As this affects the valuation analysts give to the deal... And it's a
big boost if they know it's not in Networks and it is in NDTV ... I know we
can't say stake sale (which it is not anyway)... But we do need to clarify
that the money is not in Networks‖ [Emphasis supplied]‖
112\. From contains of the mail, the addressee and recipients of the mail it
is quite apparent that whole structuring is an eye wash with the only
intention to bring 150Mn USD to NDTV ( assessee) without there being and
liability to pay it back. This what is achieved by the assessee by creating
all these agreements, subsidiary in different jurisdictions etc. We are not
inclined or to waste our time on the discussion of these emails because they
are so obvious and glaring to show the intention of the parties.
113\. It is also important at this moment to mention that the subsidiary
structure created by the assessee and investor in Netherland. The creation of
a subsidiary in a particular jurisdiction has to have a business case. It is a
matter of common knowledge that Netherland was classified as one of the low
tax jurisdiction. Netherland at that particular time had too generous tax
exemption of dividend received, no beneficial owner test for withholding tax
on dividends, not putting details of trust on public record, does not require
company accounts or beneficial ownership to be publicly available and does not
maintain company ownership details in official records. Netherland
jurisdiction also known for "virtually no substance requirement" in the  321
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, form that holding does not have employees
which can also be run through trust and management services in Netherland.
Therefore, it is apparent that the assessee has created this structure in
Netherland by creating multiple subsidiaries for the purpose of fulfilling the
above transaction. It is also explained that in the subsidiaries formed by the
assessee did not have any substance such as activities, people etc. The
subsidiaries companies were only having investments and capital and in the
case of the investor company. In the investor company, the equity share
capital was also held through the entity from Bermuda jurisdiction, which is
also similar jurisdiction for tax purposes as Netherland. While discharging
its onus it is the prime responsibility of the assessee to fully disclose all
parts of a transaction when taxability of a transaction being tested. The
assessee cannot show part of the picture without disclosing the complete
movie, which comprises of the series of transaction without explaining each
step and business rationale behind that.
114\. The assessee has further contested that transaction in question does not
pertain to the appellant and appellant is not a party to the said transaction.
Further, the provisions of section 69A speaks about the ownership of the
assets. According to the assessee as the money has been received by the
subsidiary company it cannot be taxed in the hands of the assessee. We have
also carefully perused this argument of the ld AR but are not convinced. The
assessee cannot say that it is not a party to the said transaction when in
each and every agreement the assessee is a party to the agreement. It cannot
also be accepted for the reason that the subsidiary companies were having
almost same set of directors or the persons controlled by the director that.
Further, in the emails the chairman of the company and directors are
communicating on this transactions it is not correct to say that the assessee
was not a party, in fact the assessee is the beneficiary of whole transaction.
Further, the reason for rejection of argument about chargeability u/s 69A is
that it applies wherein, in any financial year where the assessee is found to
be an owner of any money etc which is not recorded in the books of account if
any maintained by him and the assessee offers no explanation about the nature
and source of the acquisition of the money or the explanation offered by him
is not in the opinion of the ld Assessing Officer satisfactory then such money
may be deemed to be the income of the assessee for that financial year. In the
present case, the assessee is found to  322 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, be the owner of the money by the ld Assessing Officer which has
been received by the subsidiary in offshore jurisdiction and which has
travelled to the coffers of the assessee. The explanations offered by the
assessee with respect to the ownership of such sum was not satisfactorily
explained according to the Assessing Officer and therefore, such some has
rightly been deemed to be the income of the assessee. Furthermore the argument
of the ld AR that money is received by the subsidiary company of the assessee
and not by the assessee himself is also devoid of any merit because of the
reason that provision of section 69A does not make any distinction but merely
says that the assessee is found to be an owner in that case it can be charged
to tax in the hands of the assessee.
115\. The ld AR has further offered during the course of hearing to produce
the investor before the coordinate bench. We are amused with the offer because
of the reason that the information is required to be furnished before the
lower authorities were not furnished in the proper manner and in time and
therefore the assessment has been framed u/s 144 of the Act. The manner of
furnishing the information before the lower authorities is also evident from
the fact that certain basic evidences were filed by the assessee very late,
which should have been filed before the ld Assessing Officer , as additional
evidence before the ld DRP. In view of this, we reject the contention of the
ld AR on this count. Off course assessee can do so in penalty proceedings u/s
271(1) (c ) of the act , if it so wishes.
116\. With respect to the valuation and subsequent buyback of shares by the
group entities at substantial discount, the ld AR heavily relied upon the
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of CIT Vs. Five Vision
Promoters Pvt. Ltd 65 Taxmann.com 71 (Del). The ld AR stated that shares of
the investor subsequently repurchased by assessee through its subsidiaries is
not at all relevant. According to him, the chargeability must be seen only at
the time of receipt of the money. We have carefully considered the argument of
the ld AR and also perused the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court.
According to us the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court do not
apply to the facts of the case before us and our reasons are that in that case
no additional material existed other than the details of purchase and sale of
shares. In the case before us, there are additional material in the form of
trail of money coming back to the assessee and also the corroborative emails
where  323 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the chairman of the group is
also communicating on the financial transaction that are in question before
us. Furthermore, in that particular case there was no business of the
assessee, which has started, and therefore, the allegation of the revenue that
assessee being a developer is charging on money, which is taken in cash, is
incorrect. In the present case, it is the statement of the assessee that funds
have been raised for the purposes of the business. Further revenue has
established the complete modus operandi of the assessee to show that money
provided by other parties in offshore jurisdiction have come back into the
coffers of the assessee without any obligation of repayment. Further, in that
particular case there were contradictory claims of the revenue that assessee
was a conduit company and still some addition in that particular company was
made holding it to be undisclosed income of the assessee. There was also no
close connection between the investors as well as the company. In the present
case there is no allegation that assessee is a paper company , in fact it is
in business but the only allegation is that assessee is found to be an owner
of Rs. 642 crores invested by a third party in foreign jurisdiction without
any substance in the transaction and therefore, revenue charged it into the
hands of the assessee. Further, in that particular case all the investors were
regularly assessed to income tax and some of them appeared before the
assessing officer also. However, in the present case no evidences has been
laid by the assessee about the taxability of these companies and no efforts
have been made to produce the investor before the revenue authorities.
Regarding the most forceful argument of the ld AR was that repurchase of the
shares later on at substantive discount cannot lead to any adverse inference.
We would have agreed to that contention of the assessee had the issue been
merely of the correctness of transaction value, such is not the case here
before us. Hence, we do not agree with that contention in view of our findings
in the order about the modus operandi of the whole transaction. Further, the
issue decided by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court was with respect to the
provisions of section 68 of the Act where the fact was that according to the
order of the coordinate bench once the capital raised should explained the
issue of disinvestment by the shareholder subsequently was a non- issue. It
was further stated that addition if at all was to be examined in the hands of
the person who is purchasing the shares. In the present case the subsequent
sale of  324 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the shares as well as the
original investment both considered as one transaction as the revenue has
established that amount invested as a capital by an overseas investor has
landed into the hands of the assessee without repayment obligations through
series of subsidiaries and a complex structure of money trail , and such
rooting of the money is also evidenced by the emails exchanged, ld AO has
correctly made addition in the hands of the beneficiary. In view of this, the
reliance placed on this decision is devoid of any merit as the fact of that
case and the facts of this case are materially different. Similarly, the ld AR
has relied upon several decisions of various courts to state that the re-
characterization of the transaction is not permitted, however, Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of Vodaphone has already decided this issue for re-
characterization of income. In view of this after perusing all the decisions
cited by the ld AR looking to the specific facts and circumstances of the case
without discussing their fact but comparing with the facts of the case of the
assessee we reject them, as they are not comparable.
117\. The ld AR has also relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court
in case of CIT Vs. Kamdhenu Steel and Alloy Ltd 361 ITR 220 and specifically
page No. 227 to submit that when the money is transmitted through banking or
other indisputable channels the transactions would be proved and for the
purpose of genuineness of the transaction the copies of the share holder
register, share application form, share transfer register would suffice. The
creditworthiness of the creditor can be proved by producing the bank statement
then the assessee has discharged the onus. He therefore, submitted that in the
present case the complete details as mentioned in the decision has been
submitted by the assessee and therefore, the onus has been discharged. We have
carefully considered this decision and we have no hesitation in rejecting the
reliance because of the reasons that in the present these details were made
available before the ld DRP and then ld Assessing Officer carried on enquiry
in remand proceedings. During the course of hearing before us the revenue has
produced the money trail as well as certain emails, which were not at all
denied by the assessee. Therefore in our view the assessee has submitted
scanty details and also tried to hide certain facts by not denying or owning
the emails exchanged. Further it is too naïve to accept in the facts and
circumstances of the case that any transaction carried out through banking
channel should be believed as genuine. In  325 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, fact the money mostly rout through banking channels only and for
these transactions only various sections in the income tax act are
incorporated dehors the banking transitions such as section 69, 68 etc. It is
only the banking transactions through which the tax evaders bring their
unaccounted money in to the books by creating or dealing with entities/
persons without substances. In the present era where the business is carried
on through and from complex, dynamic and multi jurisdictional, diverse
entities, the transaction through banking channel does not have much credence,
especially in like cases before us. During the course of hearing assessee was
asked about KYC certificate of the foreign banks along with the beneficiary
disclosure forms from the bankers from where the transactions have originated
which is not submitted before us or before ld AO. Hence, the decision relied
upon does not help the assessee.
118\. In view of the above facts and circumstances and for the reasons given
by us we are of the opinion that ld Assessing Officer has correctly made the
addition of Rs. 6425422000/- by invoking section 69A of the Act on account of
money transferred by by M/s. Universal Studio International BV which was
routed to the coffers of the assessee by entering in to series of mergers and
liquidation by payment of dividend, loans without any obligation for
repayment. Hence, we do not find any infirmity in the order of ld Assessing
Officer as well as ld DRP and hence the addition of Rs 642.54 crores in the
hands of the assessee u/s 69A is confirmed. In the result ground no 8 of the
CO is dismissed.
119\. Ground No. 9 of the cross objection is against the addition of Rs.
2457500000/-
(US$50 million) by invoking the provisions of section 68 of the Act despite
there being no credit in the books of the appellant.
120\. The brief facts of the case is that during the year under consideration
the assessee through bonafide subsidiary NLPLc has raised unsecured loan
amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores. On query the assessee submitted that it has
been raised from NNPLCs intermediate holding company NDTV Network BV and the
relevant details has been filed during the course of assessment proceedings
for AY 2008-09. Assessee further filed that the source of the loan was from
NDTV Networks BV and above amount was disclosed in the books of NNPLC and NDTV
Network BV. The assessee further supported the same with the copies of the
financial statement of  326 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, both the
above subsidiaries. The unsecured loan was also pursuant to loan agreement
dated 10.11.2008 between Universal Studio International BV, NDTV, NNPLC and
NDTV networks BV. Assessee further submitted the confirmation of the loan,
however, as the loan confirmation did not have the bank certificates along
with the confirmation therefore, the AO was of the view that assessee has
failed to discharge its onus of proving the identity and creditworthiness of
the lender and genuineness of the transaction. The ld AO was also of the view
that the copies of the documents furnished by the assessee were only
photocopies. The ld DRP on consideration of the issue found that out of Rs.
365.25 crores Rs. 110.50 crores is due to the restatement of the original
amount pertaining to FY 200-08. It was also noted by the ld DRP no
disallowance was made in AY 2008-09 and therefore, the disallowance/ addition
to the extent of Rs. 110.5 crores cannot be made. However, the ld DRP held
that above loan was advanced without interest and the reason for it was not
explained. The ld DRP was of the view that the amount involved is quite large
and further as per the agreement the interest free credit facility was to be
granted on the basis of utilization request and no such request was produced
by the assessee before the AO or before the ld DRP. Hence, the ld DRP
confirmed the finding of the ld Assessing Officer that the onus of proving the
genuineness of the loan transaction has not been discharged by the assessee
and therefore, confirmed the finding of the ld Assessing Officer and directed
to make addition of Rs. 254.75 crores. Consequently, the ld Assessing Officer
made the addition vide para NO. 9 of his final order as under:-
> ―9. Addition on account of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores
> 9.1 It was observed that during the year, the assessee company, through its

―5.Furnish the details in connection with assessee company, through
guarantees, raising an amount of Rs. 362,25,000/- as unsecured loans through
its subsidiary NNPLC and show cause why the penal provisions and other
consequence may not be invoked for this default 5.1 At the outset, it is
submitted that the said show cause is misconceived and without jurisdiction as
the proceedings  333 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, which are
pending on date are pursuant to draft assessment order passed under section
143(3) read with section 144C of the Act which in no manner suggest that the
assessing officer could initiate penal provisions or issue show cause for
penalty provisions and other consequences.
5.2 Be that it may so and without prejudice to above and the right to
challenge the validity of the above show cause at an appropriate or appellate
stage, it is submitted that the show cause is completely misconceived in the
assessment of NDTV as the unsecured loans which are in question are part of
the Financial Statements and Balance Sheet of the NNPLC which is a separate
legal entity and this has no effect and consequence on the assessment of the
assessee. Thus, it is prayed that the same may kindly be withdrawn.
5.3 Having said so and without prejudice, it is also submitted that the amount
which is stated in the show cause seems to be incorrect as no such amount was
raised by the NNPLC through the guarantees issued by NDTV during the year in
question. On the contrary, the amount stated in the said show cause is a
difference between the liabilities as exist on March 31, 2008 and March 31,
2009 in the Balance Sheet of the NNPLC. (The copy of the same is already on
record and for the ready reference is enclosed as Annexure -- 1 of this
submission) 5.4 In view the above, the assessee herein below explains the
nature of the above liabilities of NNPLC as understood in Para 5.3 of this
letter in order to facilitate completion of the remand proceedings arising in
course of the proceedings pending before the Hon'ble DRP for the year in
question :-
334
> ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10
> M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 5.5 During the year under
> consideration NNPLC raised a sum of Rs. 254.75 Crores from its intermediate
> holding company NDTV Networks BV. Further, there is an increase in the
> liability towards the repayment of Bond holders from Rs. 399 Crores to Rs.
> 509.5 Crores as on 31st March'2009, thus, there is an increase of Rs. 110.5
> Crores due to currency translation.
Therefore, the total increase in liabilities during the year was Rs. 365
Crores. The copy of account in this regard is enclosed as Annexure - 2 of this
submission.
5.6 In respect of the loan liability of Step up Coupon Bonds, during the
immediately preceding year i.e. AY 08-09, the complete enquiry was made by AO
of NDTV in respect of issuance of bonds by NNPLC. In this regard that the
reference was also made to FT & TR and the information was called from HMRC,
UK. The assessment for AY 08-09 was completed and the addition of guarantee
fee under section 92C of the Act was made. The reason for said addition was
based on premise that NDTV had provided an undertaking to give guarantee to
Bondholders during the period of bond holders agreement, thus, it ought to
have charged guarantee fee, being an international transaction under the
section 92B of the Act, from NDTV Networks Plc. The similar addition of
Guarantee fee was also made in AY 09-10 by TPO. Further, the complete list of
the subscribers of bonds, subscription agreement and other relevant details
were duly filed during the course of the assessment of AY 08-09. The above
bond amount is duly confirmed by NNPLC to HMRC, UK on the requisition of FT &
TR. Further, the complete information with  335 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, respect to raising of bonds were duly filed before Investigation
officer and DIT (Intl) during the course of assessment and was also disclosed
in the Audited Accounts of the NDTV for AY 2008-09 and onwards. In view of the
above, we request your goodself to kindly consider the documents submitted in
the assessment of AY 2008-09 and report obtained in the course of assessment
from HMRC which are already on record.
5.7 In regard to loan from NDTV Networks BV, the amount is duly disclosed in
the books of NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV and the copies of the financials
statements of both the above subsidiaries were filed before the Ld. AO during
the course of assessment. This loan was given out of the proceeds of share
subscription received from NBCU. All necessary documents with respect to the
amount received from NBCU that is confirmation, identity, creditworthiness is
already placed on record before your goodself by the Hon'ble DRP, thus, we
request same may also kindly be considered in respect of this transaction. In
order to substantiate the identity of the Creditor, its creditworthiness and
the genuineness of the transaction, the copy of the Audited Accounts of NDTV
Networks BV is enclosed as Annexure -- 3 of this submission.
5.8 At this juncture, the assessee fervently believes in light of the facts
submitted above that there is no cause of action or default committed by the
assessee which warrants initiation of penal provisions or other consequences
under the Act, thus, it is prayed that the above show cause may kindly be
withdrawn.‖ 2.1.4 Vide letter no. 1741 dated 27.11.2013, the assessee was
again confronted on this issue as under :-

dated 11.11.2013, you were requested to furnish the complete details along
with documentary evidence regarding the source thereof, viz. the identity of
the payers, the creditworthiness of the payers and the genuineness of the
transactions. You have stated in your reply filed 26.11.2013 that sum of Rs.
254.75 crores was raised by NNPLC from its immediate subsidiary NDTV Networks
BV. Another addition of Rs. 110.5 crores is stated to be on account of
currency translation. However, no evidence has been filed by you in support of
your assertions.‖ 2.1.5 Vide the same letter, the control and management of
M/s. NDTV Network Plc, UK being with the assessee company M/s. New Delhi
Television Limited was also confronted as under :-
―2.1.1 Neither NNIH nor NNPLC were having any business activities. NNIH was a
holding company and NNPLC was incorporated to promote the interests of NNIH
and other group companies. NNPLC did not have any business activities. It had
no fixed assets and there was no rent paid. Apart from incorporation in UK,
NNPLC had no presence in UK. The address of NNPLC in UK was that of the
Company Secretary dealing with its tax matters. The Directors of NNPLC were
Indian and the audit report of NNPLC was signed at Gurgaon in India. The
authorized share capital of NNPLC was only about Rs. 47 lacs.
...‖  337 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.1.6 In response, the
assessee vide its letter dated 29.11.2013 replied as under :-
――1.13 Without prejudice to our submission, i.e. the transaction in question
is genuine transaction and has been done through banking channel and in
accordance with shares subscription agreement, therefore no adverse inference
could be drawn in any manner, your attention is also drawn to the recent
amendment of Finance Act, 2012 wherein the legislature has inserted section
56(vii)(b) wherein they have intended to tax the amount of share premium
received in excess of the Fair Market Value as other source of income. The
said provision (as amendment) is also not applicable to assessee Company as
NDTV is a company in which public is substantially interested and said
provision is not applicable for the year in question.
1.14 It is well settled that a typical large business corporation consists of
subsidiaries and each of such entities is legal entity which is also
recognized by company law and laws of taxation. Thus, your assertion that
NNPLC has no fixed assets and no rent paid is not material for determination
of the premium.
1.15 In the subsequent para of your showcause, your goodself has alleged that
the NNIH and NNPLC were holding companies having no business activities apart
from holding the investments in various group companies. Therefore, the
premium which has been paid by USBV on the face value on shares of NNIH is
prima facie not in the realm of the possibility. You will appreciate that the
investments of NNPLC in the various companies of entertainment verticals
already  338 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, existed much before entering
into the share subscription agreement and all those invested companies were
functional and doing their business. Thus, the above fact also shows that the
amount invested by the investor by way of share capital was commensurate with
the business prospect. Accordingly, it is submitted that the share premium
received by the NNIH is a genuine transaction.
...
1.18 In our earlier submission, we have already informed you that NNPLC is UK
tax resident and your allegation that the accounts were signed in India and
the directors were also Indian is not correct. On the contrary, the fact is
that the accounts which you have perused are the accounts which have been used
for the purpose of consolidation of Financial Statements of NDTV group as a
whole in order to comply with Companies Act provisions. Thus, the financials
statement formed part of the consolidated financial statements of NDTV
(including its subsidiaries) and used for only that limited purposes. It is
also submitted that it is factually incorrect that all the directors are
Indian on the board of NNPLC as there are other non-resident directors as
well.
1.19 Further, in our earlier submissions, we have informed your goodself that
through proper channels under India UK treaty, the HMRC UK has sent a report
to FT & TRto your office wherein they have provided all the information
regarding existence of NNPLC and tax compliance in accordance with UK tax laws
i.e. filing of its tax returns, WHT returns, etc.  339 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &

3\. Furnishing of evidence in relation to reinstatement of forex liability
amounting to Rs. 110.5 Crores As earlier submitted, the increase of Rs. 110.5
Crores in the Step up Coupon Bonds at year end in books of NNPLC is merely the
reinstatement of foreign currency liability in accordance with Accounting
Standards. It is most respectfully submitted that no fresh loan whatsoever was
raised by NNPLC in respect of the Step up Coupon Bonds. The amount so
increased in debited to Currency Translation Reserve in the books of accounts
of NNPLC (Please refer to Schedule - 2 Reserves & Surplus).
In respect of your specific query with respect of the evidence of such
reinstatement, please find attached the complete details of the quarterly

the exchange rates applied in the above computation, the quarterly rates as
available are annexed as Annexure -2 of this submission.‖ 2.1.7 Further, vide

circumstances of the case, the facts of the case emerge as under :-
2.1.10 While passing the draft assessment order, the then AO had recorded in
the Office Note to the Draft Assessment Order dated 31.03.2013 as under :-
―During the year the assessee company through its guarantees raised an amount
of Rs.365,25,00,000/- as unsecured loans through its subsidiary M/s NDTV

C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the
assessee has not discharged its primary onus regarding receipt of this amount
by way of unsecured loan and therefore is liable to be proceeded against under
the provisions of section 68 and 69A of I T Act, 1961. However, the assessee
has not been afforded the reasonable opportunity to discharge its primary onus
for the simple reason that the relevant and material information was furnished
by the assessee only on 30.03.2013 and there was simply no time humanly
available to afford such an opportunity to draw a balance between the interest
of public revenue and the rights of the assessee, for the present the adverse
inference against the assessee is not being drawn and appropriate remedial
measures will be taken in due course.‖ 2.1.11 Accordingly, vide this office's
letter no. 961 dated 29.08.2013 as forwarded vide CIT, Delhi-V, New Delhi's
letter no. 1269 dated 03/09.09.2013, the Hon'ble DRP was requested to consider
causing further enquiries to be made in the case u/s 144C(7) of the Act. The
Hon'ble DRP vide letter no. 262 dated 28.10.2013 directed further enquiries to
be made on the impugned issue.
2.1.12 The facts of the case are that NDTV Network Plc, UK (―NNPLC‖) is an
indirect subsidiary of the assessee and it was incorporated by the assessee in
UK on 30.11.2006. It is stated in the assessee's Annual Report for FY 2006-07
that NNPLC became a subsidiary of a newly created intermediate holding
company, NDTV Networks BV (―NNBV‖), incorporated in the Netherlands on
December 28, 2006 the Netherlands Company being a 100% subsidiary of the
assessee company. The aim of NNPLC is stated to be both to create new business
areas for NDTV as well as to unlock value of existing operations and skills.

ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.1.13 As per the referred Annual Report,
NNPLC had proposed to raise funds by issuing $100m convertible bonds due 2012.
In connection with this, the assessee Company had given an undertaking to
provide a corporate guarantee for and on behalf of NNPLC, as and when
required, in accordance with the terms of the Contracts and the Supplemental
Trust Deed to be executed by the Company.
2.1.14 In the Annual Report for FY 2007-08, it is stated that NDTV Networks
Plc has successfully raised US $ 100 Million by issue of Convertible bonds
through a private placement. This became possible solely due to the
undertaking given by the assessee for and on behalf of NNPLC and the resultant
liability has been accepted by the assessee and stated under the head
―Contingent Liabilities not provided for in respect of‖ in Part B. Notes to
Accounts of Schedule 21 to the assessee's Balance Sheet.
2.1.15 In its Annual Report for FY 2009-10, it is stated as under :-
―The Company through its subsidiary NDTV Networks BV, repurchased 26 percent
indirect stake held by NBC Universal Inc., in its subsidiary NDTV Networks
Plc.‖ 2.1.16 In the above referred report, it is further stated as under :-
―NDTV Networks Plc repurchased US$ 100 Million Step up Coupon Bonds issued by
it earlier.‖ 2.1.17 From the above position as reflected in the Annual Reports
of the assessee, which are also available on the  346 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, assessee's website
http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/corporatepage/annual_repo
rts.aspx?page=fr, it is observed that the assessee company had incorporated
NNPLC in UK in November, 2006 as its 100% subsidiary and thereafter, NNPLC was
made subsidiary of NNBV, when a month after incorporation of NNPLC, NNBV was
incorporated in December, 2006. Thus, being 100% subsidiary, NNPLC was
conceived and controlled by NDTV. Although NNPLC cannot be said to be an agent
or mere extension of NDTV solely on the ground of its being 100% subsidiary of
NTDV, the facts regarding the control exercised by NDTV over the affairs of
NNPLC are discussed below.
2.1.18 NNPLC was incorporated on 30.11.2006 with a meager capital of about Rs.
40 lacs only and was liquidated on 20.10.2011. The stated purpose of NNPLC was
to create new business areas for NDTV as well as to unlock value of existing
operations and skills, however, NNPLC did not carry on any business activities
on its own. In between its incorporation and liquidation, the activities of
NNPLC as the role of NDTV therein, are summarized below :-
Financial Activities Role of NDTV Year 2007-08 USD 100 NNPLC had only a meager
capital of Rs. 40 million were lacs and did not have any business activities,
raised through any fixed assets, any place of business Step Up except a postal
address in UK, was a new Coupon entrant without any performance record, was
Convertible a loss making company having incurred loss Bonds. of about Rs.
8.34 crores during the year, had invested in loss making companies and had its
share's face value of Rs. 40-45 per share and book value in the negative. The
raising of USD 100 million was possible solely becausethe assessee company
NDTV had given an undertaking to provide a corporate guarantee for and on
behalf of NNPLC, as and when required, in accordance with the terms of the
Contracts and the Supplemental  347 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Trust
Deed to be executed by the Company.
2008-09 26% of its Again, NNPLC had only a meager capital of stake was Rs. 40
lacs and did not have any business transferred to activities, any fixed
assets, any place of NBCU for Rs. business except a postal address in UK, was
642.54 crores a new entrant without any performance by way of record, was a
loss making company having issue of incurred loss of about Rs. 8.34 crores
during subscription the year, had invested in loss making equity of companies
and had its share's face value of parent Rs. 40-45 per share and book value in
the company negative. Looking at the facts objectively, no NNIH. prudent
investor would be investing Rs.
642.54 crores in such a loss making company having investments also in loss
making companies, more so, no prudent investor would be paying a rate of Rs.
7,015/- per share in the situation. The reflected transaction of subscription
of shares at the stated rate, as already submitted in the remand report dated
11.12.2013, is a sham transaction. Not only this, the entity NNPLC is no more
than a controlled agent of NDTV, which itself dictated the terms by being a
party to the purported Agreement and thus, introduced its own unaccounted
income from undisclosed sources with the help of this reflected transaction.
Out of this, Rs. 254.75 crores is stated to have been transferred in the
account books of NNPLC in the shape of unsecured loan from NDTV BV. Again, the
assessee NDTV is a party to the Loan Agreement.
2009-10 (i) NDTV (i) NDTV has stated in its Annual Report that through its
NDTVthrough its subsidiary NDTV Networks subsidiary BV, repurchased 26 percent
indirect stake NDTV held by NBC Universal Inc., in its subsidiary Networks BV
NDTV Networks Plc. Though the shares repurchased purportedly subscribed, not
purchased, by 26 percent NBCU were those of NNIH and not of indirect stake
NNPLC, the 2nd in vertical subsidiary of NNIH, held by NBCU yet it can be seen
that the emphasis is on in NNPLC. NNPLC and there is no reference to NNIH or
NDTV BV.
It is further pertinent to mention that the repurchase, occurring barely after
18 months, was for about Rs. 58 crores only as against the ‗purchase' for Rs.
642.54 crores. There is no rationale in this transaction - no  348 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, commercial purpose or economic substance, other
than to create a loss of Rs. 584 crores for NBCU and introduction of own
unaccounted money for NDTV.
(ii) NNPLC (ii) The final transaction before the liquidation repurchased of
NNPLC was the purported repurchase of US$ 100 Step Up Coupon Convertible
Bonds.
Million Step up However, the price of the coupons reflected Coupon at Rs. 399
crores as on 31.03.2008 and at Convertible Rs. 509.50 crores as on 31.03.2009
(the Bonds issued difference of Rs. 110.50 crores stated to be by it earlier.
on account of currency fluctuation) would further escalate at the time of
repurchase and when NNPLC had a capital of Rs. 40 lacs only and investment in
loss making companies, then it remains to be verified as to how NDTV / NNPLC
discharged its liability towards the principal and interest payable to the
investors on the said repurchase.
2.1.19 From the above, the inevitable conclusion is that NNPLC was a Special
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created by NDTV, which acted as agent of NDTV for the
purposes of NDTV and was liquidated as soon as it had outlived the purpose of
its creation.
2.1.20 In the case of Adams vs Cape Industries Plc [(1990) 2 WLR 6578], it was
held that one of the three circumstances in which the corporate veil may be
lifted would be in a situation, where the subsidiary is an agent of the
company. In the present case, the situation is the same and the business
affairs of the holding company NDTV and the subsidiary NNPLC are so
intertwined that it is not only permissible but necessary to lift the
corporate veil. The intertwining is evident from the fact that NNPLC carried
out only two major transactions during its existence - the 1st transaction was
to raise USD 100 million through Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds, which was
possible only due to undertaking for corporate guarantee offered by NDTV and
NDTV was a party to the Agreement along with NNPLC and the 2nd transaction was
the indirect transfer of 26% of its stake to NBCU by way of subscription in
equity of parent  349 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, company
NNIH, in which again, NDTV was a party to the Agreement along with NNPLC. In
both transactions, it was NTYDV which dictated the terms and in neither of the
two transactions, NNPLC acted independently. Under these circumstances, it is
evident that NNPLC is a mere façade entity on behalf of NDTV ; and without
prejudice to this, NNPLC is beyond doubt an agent of NDTV.
2.1.21 As such, it is a fit case, in which corporate veil needs to be lifted
and once the veil is lifted, with regard to the present proceedings for AY
2009-10, it can be observed as under :-
(i) NDTV through NNPLC has introduced its own unaccounted income from
undisclosed sources amounting to Rs. 642.54 crores in the garb of equity
subscription. Detailed report regarding taxability of this sum has already
been submitted to the Hon'ble DRP vide letter no. 1794 dated 11.12.2013.
(ii) NDTV through NNPLC has enhanced the liability on account of Step Up
Coupon Convertible Bonds by Rs. 110.50 crores in the Balance Sheet of NNPLC
from Rs. 399 crores to Rs. 509.50 crores, which is stated to be on account of
currency translation. Further, NDTV has introduced unsecured loans amounting
to Rs. 254.75 crores from NDTV BV in the books of NNPLC. The tax implications
of this issue are the subject matter of the present report, which necessitated
the lifting of corporate veil first, as discussed in the preceding paras of
this report.
2.2 Regarding enhancement of liability on account of Step Up Coupon
Convertible Bonds by Rs. 110.50 crores  350 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 2.2.1 As discussed above, USD 100 million were reflected to have
been raised through Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds during FY 2007-08. As
stated in para 2.1.2 of this report, vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated
11.11.2013, the assessee was asked to explain on this issue, and in response,
vide letter dated 26.11.2013, the assessee stated that the source of
investment in Bonds was duly verified by the AO during the assessment
proceedings for AY 2008-09 and also through information obtained from UK tax
authorities through FT & TR. It was contended that complete details regarding
investors and source of investment was given to the AO at the relevant time.
The details were also stated to have been furnished before Investigation
officer and DIT (Intl) during enquiries by these officers.
2.2.2 Vide this office letter dated 05.12.2013, the assessee was informed that
no such documents were found in the assessment record for AY 2008-09. The
assessee vide letter dated 09.12.2013 stated that it was again filing copy of
the submission dated 08.02.2012filed in the course of assessment of AY
2008-09before AO, which consisted of the complete list of the subscribers to
bonds, subscription agreement and other relevant details and documents
enclosed as Annexure B. Copies of submissions dated 28.05.2012, 31.05.2012,
11.06.2012 and 20.07.2012 stated to have beenfiled before the then AO and
copies of submissions dated 18.02.2011, 03.03.2011, 08.03.2011, 29.03.2011 and
30.03.2011 stated to have been filed before the Investigation Officer and DIT
were also claimed to have been enclosed as Annexure C1-C5.
2.2.3 However, perusal of the documents enclosed by the assessee reveals that
in response to requisition to prove the identity of the investors, their
creditworthiness and genuineness of the transactions, the assessee has filed
merely a list titled ―The  351 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Initial
Investors‖, listing out 8 entities, many of them from Cayman Islands and
furnishing of such list does not discharge the assessee of its onus to prove
the identity and creditworthiness of the entities or the genuineness of the
transactions.
2.2.4 It is pertinent to mention that even though the original amounts on
account of these bonds are claimed to have been received last year and not in
the financial year relevant to AY 2009- 10, yet when the original amount
itself is not proved to be on account of genuine transaction, any escalation
in the same whether due to currency translation or otherwise must necessarily
meet the same fate. Hence, the amount of Rs. 110.50 crores, being enhancement
during the year, in the original liability from unproved source, is proposed
to be added to the assessee's taxable income for AY 2009-10.
2.3 Regarding introduction of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores
from NDTV BV in the books of NNPLC 2.3.1 During the year under consideration,
NDTV through NNPLC has raised unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores as
mentioned in the relevant Schedule to Balance Sheet as on 31.03.2009. When
asked vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated 11.11.2013, the assessee
replied that the unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores had been raised
from NNPLC's intermediate holding company NDTV Networks BV and the relevant
details had been filed during the course of assessment proceedings for AY
2008-09.
2.3.2 Vide letter dated 05.12.2013, it was intimated to the assessee that on
perusal of assessment record for AY 2008-09, no such documents were found.
Accordingly, the assessee was given  352 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014
C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, an
opportunity to now file these documents, which were being claimed to have been
filed by it earlier. The assessee was also intimated that it had not
discharged the onus cast upon it in respect of the above transactions of
raising unsecured loans.
2.3.3 In response, the assesse filed reply dated 09.12.2013 stating that with
respect to the unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores, the source
thereof was loan form NDTV Networks BV and the amount was duly disclosed in
the books of NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV and the copies of the financials
statements of both the above subsidiaries were filed before the Ld. AO during
the course of assessment vide submission dated 27.02.2013 & 11.03.2013. The
copies of the said submissions were claimed to be duly enclosed as Annexure E1
& E2 of the reply dated 09.12.2013.
2.3.4 I have perused the assessee's letters dated 27.02.2013 (running into 10
pages) & 11.03.2013 (running into 2 pages) marked as Annexure E1 and Annexure
E2 respectively. At the outset, it is submitted that there is no reference to
the impugned issue of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores raised
during the year. The contents of the referred letters address certain queries
raised by the AO and query regarding unsecured loans is not one of such
queries. The bare letters are not even supported by any Annexures mentioned
ion the said letters.
2.3.5 Under the circumstances, when the attached annexure- less letters do not
contain any reference to query regarding unsecured loans nor attempt to
address such query, therefore, filing of such letters does not serve any
purpose.
2.3.6 It is pertinent to mention that during the course of hearing before the
Hon'ble DRP on 23.12.2013, the assessee has filed a  353 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
& 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, reply on the issue. It has been stated by the assessee that the
impugned unsecured loan has been raised pursuant to Loan Agreement dated
10.11.2008 between Universal Studios International BV, NDTV, NNPLC and NDTV
Networks BV. Confirmation from Universal Studios International BV is also
stated to be attached. However, perusal of the attached confirmation reveals
that although there is a mention regarding the bank account of Universal
Studios International BV, namely BNP Paribas and copy of bank certificate is
stated to have been attached, yet no bank certificate has been actually
attached.
2.3.7 In view of the above, it is submitted that the assessee cannot be said
to have discharged its onus of proving the identity of the lender,
creditworthiness of the lender and the genuineness of the transaction. Even
the copies of documents, wherever furnished by the assessee, are photocopies,
not subject to any verification or enquiries. It is pertinent to place on
record that any specific issues can be proved only by specific evidence and
not on the strength of claimed reputation or volume of business of the lender.
Hence, the assessee has not been able to prove the source of addition in
unsecured loans and the same is proposed to be added to the assessee's taxable
income.
3\. The report is submitted for kind perusal and consideration.‖ 9.5 After
considering the above facts, the Hon'ble DRP vide its directions dated
31.12.2013 issued u/s 144C(5) of the Act held that out of Rs. 365.25 crores
reflected as increase in liabilities, an amount of Rs. 110.50 crores was due
to restatement of the original amount pertaining to the transaction occurring
in FY 2007-08 relevant to AY 2008-09. Regarding the balance amount of Rs.
254.75 crores, the DRP held that the assessee failed  354 ITA No.

genuineness of the transaction. The observations of the DRP are reproduced
below :-
―5.17. AO has brought to the notice of the DRP through his letter dated
20.08.2013 forwarded by the Addl. CIT, Range-13, New Delhi that an amount of
Rs. 365.25 crores was raised by the assessee company which needed further
examination. The relevant part of the letter of the AO is as under:
"10. Another issue involved in the case is that during the year, the assessee
company, through its guarantees, raised an amount of Rs. 365,25,00,000/- as
unsecured loans through its subsidiary NNPLC. As the information was stated to
be furnished by the assessee on 30.03.2013, i.e. just one day before the
expiry of limitation, therefore, this aspect also could not be probed by the
AO as to the identity of the payers, the creditworthiness of the payers and
the genuineness of the transactions."
5.18. Accordingly, the AO was directed to examine this issue and send a remand
report. The remand report was given to the assessee who strongly objected to
the proposed addition made by the AO in the remand report. The remand report
dated 11.12.2013 and the summary of the oral argument of the AO dated
26.12.2013 are reproduced below:

2.4.3 In response, vide letter dated 26.11.2013, the assessee contended that
during the year under consideration, there was an increase of Rs. 110.50
crores in the amount of unsecured loans in the Balance Sheet of NNPLC, which
represented an increase due to currency fluctuation. The assessee further
stated that during the previous AY 2008-09, it had raised loans amounting to
Rs. 399 crores by way of Step Up Coupon Bonds and the enquiry regarding the
source and genuineness thereof had already been completed during the course of
assessment proceedings for AY 2008-09. It was claimed that complete evidence
regarding the same had been filed before the AO during the said assessment
proceedings and the AO had also obtained information from HMRC through FT &
TR. Vide further reply dated 29.11.2013, the assessee also filed copy of
exchange rates for the relevant period.

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, with letter dated 27.11.2013, please explain
and substantiate your position."
2.4.5 In response, vide letter dated 10.12.2013, the assessee stated that out
of the total addition of Rs. 365.25 crores appearing in the Balance Sheet of
NNPLC, an amount of Rs. 110.50 crores was on account of adjustment of
fluctuation in exchange rate of currency and regarding the balance amount of
Rs. 254.75 crores, the assessee stated that this was the unsecured loan
obtained from NDTV BV. However, no confirmation was filed nor this office was
afforded any verification regarding the creditworthiness of the lender or the
genuineness of the transaction. In the absence of these, the assessee has not
discharged its onus u/s 68 and there is no alternative but to propose that the
amount of Rs. 254.75 crores may be added to the assessee's taxable income for
the year under consideration. Further, it is pertinent to mention that
although the assessee claimed that "the complete list of the subscribers of
bonds, subscription agreement and other relevant details were duly filed
during the course of the assessment of AY 08-09", yet no such details were
found in the assessment records, which was specifically confronted to the
assessee and yet, the assessee has failed to substantiate its claim."
5.19. The copy of the remand report was given to the assessee on 16.12.2013 to
submit its rejoinder and on the day of hearing i.e. on 17.12.2013 they were
asked to treat the forwarding letter of the DRP enclosing the remand report as
enhancement notice by DRP to cut short the time as matter is getting time
barred on 31.12.2013. The same was recorded in the order sheet vide entry
dated 17.12.2013.
5.20. In response to the above, the assessee vide its letter dated 23.12.2013
has filed a document which is purported to be a loan agreement concluded
between NBCU, NDTV Limited, NDTV PLC and NDTV Networks  359 ITA No.
1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, BV and requested to admit the same. The
assessee has further submitted as below:
> • The appellant was not able to produce the above documents since the issue
> came up for the first time before the DRP and the assessee as unable to
> submit the same due to paucity of time.
• The loan agreement was not specifically asked for by the Ld. AO. • The
evidence submitted in this submission is correct and very much relevant for
deciding the appeal of the appellant. • It is requested to your goodself that
the evidences be admitted and be considered for deciding the matter.
Your goodself may exercise the powers conferred on yourself by the law, which
are very much required to be exercised in the light of facts and circumstances
of the case.
5.21. The additional evidence in the form of copy of the purported loan
agreement (supri has been admitted in the interest of natural justice and was
handed over to the AO for his response. The response is received, the extract
of which is reproduced below:
Extract of response of the AO dated 26.12.2013 "2.2 Regarding enhancement of
liability on account of Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds by Rs. 110.50 crores
2.2.1 As discussed above, USD 100 million were reflected to have been raised
through Step Up Coupon Convertible Bonds during FY 2007-08. As stated in para
2.1.2 of this report, vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated 11.11.2013, the
assessee was asked to explain on this issue, and in response, vide letter
dated 26.11.2013, the assessee stated that the source of investment in Bonds
was duly verified by the AO during the assessment proceedings for AY 2008-09
and also through information  360 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, obtained
from UK tax authorities through FT & TR. It was contended that complete
details regarding investors and source of investment was given to the AO at
the relevant time. The details were also stated to have been furnished before
Investigation officer and DIT (Intl) during enquiries by these officers.
2.2.2 Vide this office letter dated 05.12.2013, the assessee was informed that
no such documents were found in the assessment record for AY 2008-09. The
assessee vide letter dated 09.12.2013 stated that it was again filing copy of
the submission dated 08.02.2012 filed in the course of assessment of AY
2008-09 before AO, which consisted of the complete list of the subscribers to
bonds, subscription agreement and other relevant details and documents
enclosed as Annexure B. Copies of submissions dated 28.05.2012, 31.05.2012,
11.06.2012 and 20.07.2012 stated to have been filed before the then AO and
copies of submissions dated 18.02.2011, 03.03.2011, 08.03.2011, 29.03.2011 and
30.03.2011 stated to have been filed before the Investigation Officer and DIT
were also claimed to have been enclosed as Annexure C1-C5.
2.2.3 However, perusal of the documents enclosed by the assessee reveals that
in response to requisition to prove the identity of the investors, their
creditworthiness and genuineness of the transactions, the assessee has filed
merely a list titled "The Initial Investors", listing out 8 entities, many of
them from Cayman Islands and furnishing of such list does not discharge the
assessee of its onus to prove the identity and creditworthiness of the
entities or the genuineness of the transactions.
2.2.4 It is pertinent to mention that even though the original amounts on
account of these bonds are claimed to have been received last year and not in
the financial year relevant to AY 2009-10, yet when the original amount itself
is not proved to be on account of genuine transaction, any escalation in the
same whether due to currency translation or otherwise must necessarily meet
the same fate. Hence, the amount of Rs. 110.50 crores, being enhancement
during the year, in the  361 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, original
liability from unproved source, is proposed to be added to the assessee's
taxable income for AY 2009-10.
2.3 Regarding introduction of unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores
from NDTV BVin the books of NNPLC 2.3.1 During the year under consideration,
NDTV through NNPLC has raised unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores as
mentioned in the relevant Schedule to Balance Sheet as on 31.03.2009. When
asked vide this office's letter no. 1705 dated 11.11.2013, the assessee
replied that the unsecured loan amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores had been raised
from NNPLC's intermediate holding company NDTV Networks BV and the relevant
details had been filed during the course of assessment proceedings forAY
2008-09.
2.3.2 Vide letter dated 05.12.2013, it was intimated to the assessee that on
perusal of assessment record for AY 2008-09, no such documents were found.
Accordingly, the assessee was given an opportunity to now file these
documents, which were being claimed to have been filed by it earlier. The
assessee was also intimated that it had not discharged the onus cast upon it
in respect of the above transactions of raising unsecured loans.
2.3.3 In response, the assesse filed reply dated 09.12.2013 stating that with
respect to the unsecured loans amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores, the source
thereof was loan form NDTV Networks BV and the amount was duly disclosed in
the books of NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV and the copies ofthefinancials
statements of both the above subsidiaries were filed before the Ld. AO during
the course of assessment vide submission dated 27.02.2013 & 11.03.2013. The
copies of the said submissions were claimed to be duly enclosed as Annexure El
& E2 of the reply dated 09.12.2013.
2.3.4 I have perused the assessee's letters dated 27.02.2013 (running into 10
pages) &11.03.2013 (running into 2 pages) marked as  362 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014
& 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Annexure El and Annexure E2 respectively. At the outset, it is
submitted that there is no reference to the impugned issue of unsecured loans
amounting to Rs. 254.75 crores raised during the year. The contents of the
referred letters address certain queries raised by the AO and query regarding
unsecured loans is not one of such queries. The bare letters are not even
supported by any Annexures mentioned ion the said letters.
2.3.5 Under the circumstances, when the attached annexure- less letters do not
contain any reference to query regarding unsecured loans nor attempt to
address such query, therefore, filing of such letters does not serve any
purpose 2.3.6 It is pertinent to mention that during the course of hearing
before the Hon'ble DRPon 23.12.2013, the assessee has filed a reply on the
issue. It has been stated by the assesseethat the Impugned unsecured loan has
been raised pursuant to Loan Agreement dated 10.11.2008between Universal
Studios International BV, NDTV, NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV.Confirmation from
Universal Studios International BV is also stated to be attached.
However,perusal of the attached confirmation reveals that although there is a
mention regarding the bankaccount of Universal Studios International BV,
namely BNP Paribas and copy of bankcertificate Is stated to have been
attached, yet no bank certificate has been actually attached.
2.3.7 In view of the above, it is submitted that the assessee cannot be said
to have discharged its onus of proving the identity of the lender,
creditworthiness of the lender and the genuineness of the transaction. Even
the copies of documents, wherever furnished by the assessee, are photocopies,
not subject to any verification or enquiries. It is pertinent to place on
record that any specific issues can be proved only by specific evidence and
not on the strength of claimed reputation or volume of business of the lender.
Hence, the assessee has not been able to prove  363 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, the source of addition in unsecured loans and the same is
proposed to be added to the assessee's taxable income."
5.22. DRP has carefully considered this issue. Out of Rs. 365.25 crores
representing unsecured loan, under reference, an amount of Rs. 110.5 crores is
due to the restatement of the original amount pertaining to a transaction
happened in the FY 2007-08 which was the subject matter of assessment for the
AY 2008-09. It appears from the report that there was no disallowance made on
the amount in the first place in the AY 2008-09. Therefore, to disallow Rs.
110.5 crores on account of reinstatement of the amount is not called for as
rightly mentioned by the AO in his remand report dated 11.12.2013. (quoted in
the earlier paragraph no. 5.18 on Page no. 22 onwards) 5.23. The AO has
examined the said agreement and in his response dated 26.12.2013 has clearly
brought out that even after the production of the copy of the agreement
assessee has not discharged its onus of explaining the genuineness of the
transaction. From a bare reading of the so called agreement copy by the DRP,
it is found that the above loan is advanced without any interest, the reason
for which has not been explained. The amount involved is quite a large sum of
money. Further, as per this document, the interest free credit facility was to
be granted on the basis of a duly completed utilization request, where as no
such utilization request or basis for seeking the above credit facility has
been produced by the assessee before the AO or before the DRP. We are
therefore in agreement with the AO's finding that the onus of proving the
genuineness of the loan transaction has not been discharged by the assessee.
The AO is, therefore, directed to make addition of Rs. 254.75 crores.‖ 9.6 In
view of the above detailed facts and circumstances of the case and in
compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble DRP as reproduced above, it is
held that the assessee has failed to discharge its onus of proving the
genuineness of the transaction of raising unsecured loan through its  364 ITA
No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New
Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, subsidiary NDTV Networks Plc and hence, the
amount of Rs. 254.75 crores representing the amount of such unsecured loan is
added to the assessee' taxable income u/s 68 of the Act.
9.7 As I am satisfied that on this issue, the assessee has concealed the
particulars of its income within the meaning of section 271(1)(c) of the Act,
therefore, penalty proceedings are separately initiated.‖
121\. The ld AR further submitted that copies of the loan agreement are
provided wherein the credit facility of US$ 15 million (Rs.254.75 crores) was
provided by NDTV Networks BV to NDTV Networks PLc. He submitted that the loan
transaction supported by the balance sheet of the NDTV Network PLc and NDTV
Network BV. He further referred to the bank statement of the lender as well as
the borrower to show that above loan transactions have been executed by the
bank account of NDTV Networks BV with Syndicate Bank, London. He also
supported that the same money has been received in the bank account of NDTV
Network PLC with Syndicate Bank. He further submitted that the copies of the
ledger account of borrower from the books of the lender and of lender from the
books of borrower. For the identity of the lender he submitted the deed of
incorporation as well as the tax residency certificate issued by the
Netherland Tax Authority. In view of this he submitted that assessee has
proved the identity, creditworthiness and genuineness of the transaction. He
further referred to written submission vide para No. 37 GROUND NO. 4 TO 4.1

Networks BV under a loan agreement 37.2 No addition with respect to the above
was made in the draft assessment order objected before the DRP. The addition
was made by the DRP on the basis of the remand report of the AO made in
pursuance of a specific request raised by the AO to the DRP to cause further
enquiry as certain issue had not been considered while completing the draft
assessment order. Such request was made by the AO for the following two issues
which are mentioned at page 865 of the paper book Volume - III wherein it has
been stated that unsecured loans were allegedly received by the appellant
through its subsidiary NNPLC and the tax implications  365 ITA No.

                                                           appellant and in order
                                                           to reject the evidences
                                                           the addition was made
                                                           which came to the
                                                           knowledge only on
                                                           receipt      of    DRP
                                                           directions. On merits
                                                           charging of interest to a
                                                           group     company       is
                                                           based on commercial
                                                           expediency having a
                                                           holding and subsidiary
                                                           relationship.
                                                           Further, the loan given
                                                           is        utilised    in
                                                           accordance with the
                                                           request        of  credit
                                                           utilisation.
                     (2) DRP alleged that the
                     transaction   could     not     be
                     genuine on account of a reason
                     that such a huge amount of loan
                     is given without interest and
                     further as per the loan
                     agreement, utilization of credit is
                     not submitted by the appellant.
37.4 In addition to the above, following issues also need to be considered
which is given separately in the detailed note.
 Powers/jurisdiction of the AO to make request to the DRP to cause further
enquiry on issues which were not raised in the draft assessment order 
Powers/ jurisdiction of DRP for enhancement of total income on account of
taxing a new source of income.
 NNPLC is a separate assessee and therefore, no addition could be made in the
hands of the appellant.
37.5 In regard of the above addition, firstly the applicant most respectfully
submitts that on the facts of the case and in law, the Ld. DRP had exceeded
its jurisdiction while directing the Ld. AO to conduct an enquiry by invoking
provisions of section 144C (7)(b) of the Act on the matters which have been
reported by the Ld. AO himself after completing the draft assessment order by
way of application dated  367 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, August 20,
2013 at the back of the assessee which in itself is bad in law and is not in
consonance with the provisions of section 144C of the Act. (Copy of the said
request of the AO to DRP is enclosed as Annexure -and copy of directions
issued by the DRP to the AO dated October 28, 2103 at page 856 of Paper Book-
III) In addition of the above, the show cause of enhancement issued on the
basis of the remand report on the above addition and the direction thereof by
the Hon'ble DRP to add the above amount in the total income of the assesee is
completely illegal and without any jurisdiction.
37.6 The applicant most respectfully submits that before it proceeds with
facts of the case and merits of the additions, the jurisdictional issue
arising on account of the above addition needs to be adjudicated first.
Accordingly, the applicant here-in- below address the jurisdiction issue first
which applicant fervently believes would be decided in favour of the assesee,
and thus, said addition deserves to be deleted on this ground alone. On the
facts of the case and from the order of the Hon'ble DRP, following
legal/jurisdiction issues would emerge in respect of the above additions:-
i) Whether an assessing officer who became ex-officio by passing a draft
assessment order could make request of further enquiry on issues which are not
part of the draft assessment order?
ii) Whether the DRP could issue directions on such request under section
144C(7)(b) of the Act?
iii) Whether the DRP could make enhancement in the total income of the assesee
on a completely new source of income which is not emanating from the draft
assessment order?
These questions are bound to be decided in favor of the applicant and hence no
tax demand can be raised on the Applicant based on the enhancement made by the
Ld. AO pursuant to the directions of the Ld. DRP.
37.7 The applicant most respectfully submitted that the action of the Ld. AO
to make a request of further enquiries on issues which are not part of the
draft assessment order was unprecedented, completely illegal and in violation
of the principles of the due process of law. In the given facts of the case,
it was submitted that the effect of such request of the AO to make further
enquiries would result into a scenario where an ex-officio authority i.e.
assessing officer, would re-commence the assessment proceedings or get
jurisdiction over the applicant for assessment which stands concluded by
passing a draft assessment order. The legislature had never intended to give
such powers to the AO to interfere with proceedings pending before the
appellate/higher authority to conduct a fresh draft assessment. It is now well
settled principle that an assessment once made is final and that it is not
open to the assessing officer to make fresh enquiries on any issue except by
reopening the assessment under section 147 of the Act subject to the
limitations, restrictions and conditions laid down in section 147 of the Act.
In the given case, the draft assessment once made can be enquired, modified or
interfered only in accordance with law and in the manner provided under
section 144C of the Act. The Hon'ble Bench would appreciate that there is no
provision in section 144C where an assessing office could made such request
suo moto, therefore, it is submitted that the request of the AO dated August
20, 2013 and the directions of the DRP dated October 28, 2013 are completely
illegal and without jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is submitted that no
addition could be made on the basis of the illegal action under section
144C(8) of the Act.
37.8 The applicant further submits that the DRP has exceeded its jurisdiction
in  368 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY:
2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, bringing to tax the aforesaid
amount of Rs. 254.75 Crores in the hands of the applicant company. Section
144C(8) of the Act empowers the DRP not only to confirm or reduce the
variation proposed in the draft assessment order to the benefit of the
assessee but also to enhance it to the prejudice of the assessee. This power
of enhancement which is impliedly embedded in the matter of issuing
directions, due to the use of expression `as it thinks fit', in section
144C(5) of the Act is now expressly set out in s. 144C(8) of the Act. If the
DRP reaches the conclusion that the Ld. AO/TPO has erred in determining the
total income of the assessee and thereby warranting further
adjustments/additions, in that case the Hon'ble Panel could do so subject to
the embargo that the said enhancement of income should either be emanating
from the objections of the assessee before the Hon'ble Panel or the Hon'ble
Panel suo moto finds out that the Ld. AO had failed to make such additions to
the total income though the material was available on record.
37.9 The Explanation to section 144C(8) of the Act inserted by the Finance
Act, 2012 with retrospective effect from 01.04.2009 has widened the DRP's
power of enhancement to all the matters arising out of the assessment
proceedings irrespective of whether they were raised or not by the assessee.
With this amplification of the power, even the matters not agitated by the
assessee before the DRP can also be considered for the purposes of
enhancement. Accordingly, in principle, the DRP was entitled to embark upon
the question of enhancement in the draft assessment, however, such issue of
enhancement would be based on an independent and suo moto directions of the
Hon'ble Panel and not at the behest of the Ld. AO/CIT as done in the present
case. Under the provisions of the Act, both the Ld. AO and CIT have enough
powers to make enquiries for escapement of income or have revisionary powers
under section 263 of the Act which could be exercised if there is any
escapement of income or where the order is erroneous and prejudicial to the
interests of the revenue.
37.10 Thus, it most respectfully submitted that no enhancement can be made in
the present case on the issues for which enquiry has been conducted on the
specific request of the Ld. AO/CIT as it amounts to abuse of due process of
law and principles of natural justice.
37.11 Further, the assessee though not disputing the above powers of the
Hon'ble DRP for enhancement, however, would like to bring to your Honours
notice that by Finance Act 2012 an amendment has also been made under section
253 (2A) of the Act wherein the Commissioner has the right to appeal against
the directions of the DRP under section 144C(5) of the Act. Thus, the entire
scheme existing as on date shows that the DRP has a power similar to what is
available with the CIT(A) under section 251 of the Act.
37.12 Therefore, the issues in respect of the powers of enhancement of CIT(A)
as decided by the various courts are squarely applicable while making an
enhancement in the present case, if any, based on the said remand report
forwarded by the Ld AO.
37.13 In the case of CIT vs. Sardari lal and Company reported in 251 ITR 864
(Full Bench) on the issue that whether the CIT(A) has the power to tax a new
source of income by exercising the powers of enhancement embedded u/s 251(1A)
of the Act, it was held as under. The relevant paragraph of the decision is
reproduced below.
369
ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s.
New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, ―Looking from the aforesaid angles, the
inevitable conclusion is that whenever the question of taxability of income
from a new source of income is concerned, which had not been considered by the
Assessing Officer, the jurisdiction to deal with the same in appropriate cases
may be dealt with under section 147/148 and section 263, if requisite
conditions are fulfilled. It is inconceivable that in the presence of such
specific provisions, a similar power is available to the first appellate
authority. That being the position, decision in Union Tyres'case (supra) of
this Court expresses the correct view and does not need re-consideration. This
reference is accordingly disposed‖ 37.14 Thus, the power of enhancement does
not vest with the DRP in respect of any new source of income which was not at
all considered by the Ld. AO during the course of the draft assessment
proceedings. The direction of the DRP to bring to tax an amount of Rs. 254.75
crores in the hands of the applicant company is totally arbitrary and is not
warranted under the present scheme of the provisions of the Act. Thus, any
addition of a new source of income is totally unwarranted and deserves to be
struck down on these jurisdictional issues.
37.15 On merits of the case, the applicant further submits that during the
year under consideration, NNPLC raised a sum of Rs. 254.75 Crores from its
intermediate holding company NDTV Networks BV under a loan agreement already
furnished on record during the course of DRP proceedings.
37.16 It is further submitted that in respect of Rs. 245. 75 crores, the Ld.
AO had alleged that no confirmation has been filed and no verification
regarding the credit worthiness of the lender was afforded to this office,
thus, in the absence of the same the said amount should be added under section
68 of the Act in the hands of NDTV. Here it is pertinent to add that with
respect to an amount of Rs. 254.75 Crores, it is already submitted before the
Ld. AO that the sum in question represents the loan form NDTV Networks BV and
the amount is duly disclosed in the books of NNPLC and NDTV Networks BV and
the copy of the financials statements of both the above subsidiaries were duly
already on record. In order to substantiate that the transaction has been
undertaken through ordinary banking process the copy of the bank statements of
NNPLC and NNBV were also placed on record which now leaves no room of doubt
about the genuineness of the said transaction.
37.17 The credit worthiness as well as the source of investment is duly
substantiated from the cash flow statement of NNBV which is part of the
financial statement and that the above loan was given out of the proceeds of
share subscription by NBCU. All necessary documents with respect to the amount
received from NBCU that is confirmation, identity, creditworthiness has
already been placed on record during the course of the proceedings. Thus, the
same could not be ignored as conclusive evidence that the loan transaction was
genuine and making additions on account of surmrises and conjectures by the
AO/DRP was completely unjustified.
37.18 In light of the above, Applicant company had duly discharged its onus in
the course of the proceedings beyond any suspicion or doubt, though the
transaction in question was not related to the books of accounts (standalone)
of the applicant which was the subject matter of the impugned assessment
proceedings. The amounts were shown as a liability in one of the subsidiaries
of the assessee  370 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, company,
namely NDTV Networks Plc (‗NNPLC'). Therefore, the directions of the DRP to
add the said sum in the total income is arbitrary, illegal and deserves to be
quashed on these grounds also in addition to jurisdictional issue as submitted
above.
The Ld AO in spite of the above facts chose to draw incorrect inferences on
the existence of NDTV Networks Plc by making misleading and erroneous
submission, though in fact in the same proceedings assessee company had
suffered a transfer pricing adjustment on account of Guarantee fee not being
charged from NDTV Networks Plc.
Here it is pertinent to add that the Ld. AO had wrongly stated in
questionnaire as well as in his request to DRP that the appellant had raised
an amount of Rs 365,25,00,000/-. On the contrary the facts were that NDTV
Networks plc (separate assessee) raised funds from its group subsidiary. The
above fact was duly submitted before the Ld AO by the appellant in its
submission dated November 26, 2013 (enclosed at page 1159 of paperbook IV,
para 5) and in the same submission submitted that the existence of NDTV
Networks plc, being a separate entity is supported by the fact that in
immediate preceding year (AY 2008-09) due enquiry of its affairs were made in
the course of the assessment proceedings.
Be that it may so, the finding to make such additions is based on following
two accounts.
1\. Non charging of interest on such loan
2\. Non production of utilisation request to seek such loan facility.
At the outset it is submitted that the above findings are contrary to well
settled law in making additions u/s 68 of the Act in view of the following

37.19 In light of the above, it is further submitted that no addition is
warranted on the preliminary objection that the said transaction is not
related to the applicant and belongs to NNPLC which is a separate regular
assessee before DDIT (International Circle) - 2(1), New Delhi. Thus, any
addition in respect of this transaction is legally unsustainable and needs to
be rejected.
37.20 At this stage, the applicant also submits that though for the above
addition the lifting of corporate veil had not been specifically invoked as
done in another addition, yet for the sake of argument, if it is assumed
though not admitting that revenue intended to invoke lifting of corporate veil
with respect of this addition as well. The consequent result of said
assumption is that one of the subsidiaries of the assessee group i.e. NNBV had
given a loan to other subsidiary of the assesee group i.e. NNPLC and for the
fiscal nullity the existence of both the subsidiaries need to be ignored and
to be assumed the transaction have been undertaken by the applicant company
with self by debiting and crediting its own account which in no manner could
result into a taxable event. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of in the
case of KikaBhai Premchand (Sir) vs. CIT reported in 24 ITR 506 (SC) has laid
down that no man can be supposed to be trading with himself for the purpose of
ascertaining taxable profits. The facts of the aforesaid case is not identical
to facts of the assesee as stated above, yet the ratio of the said decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court canvassed that no income could arose to assesee while
trading with self. In view of the above also, the transaction reported in NNBV
and NNPLC books of accounts can have no implications on the taxable income of
the Applicant Company. Accordingly, it is submitted that any addition in
respect of this transaction is legally unsustainable and needs to be rejected
37.21 In view of the aforesaid, the addition made of Rs. 254,75,00,000/- may
kindly be deleted.
122\. The ld DR submitted that in the statement recorded of the Director of
the company Shri KLV Narayan Rao on 23.07.2015 wherein it has been stated in
response to question No. 34 that most of the funds came to the Indian
subsidiaries through NNPLC, which also included the loan of US$15 million.
Therefore, this issue is still required to be examined.
123\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The director of the
company who is also signatory to the appeals as well as most correspondences
was examined by the ld Assessing Officer on 23.07.2015. the copy of the
statement was provided to the assessee along with the show cause notice dated
15.06.2016 issued u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act. In the reply submitted by the
assessee before the Assessing Officer the request for cross-examination of Mr.
Rao was not shown to have been made. The assessee has explained the statement
of Mr. Rao and submitting its  372 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, reply at
page no. 23 to 25 of its reply submitted on 02.11.2016. Even otherwise, Mr.
Rao is the Director of the company and director of the some subsidiaries. He
was also the CEO of the company. During the course of his examination, he was
asked question No. 34 wherein the details of funds raised and retained of the
foreign subsidiaries was asked. He replied that most of the funds came to the
Indian subsidiaries particularly NDTV Imagine through NNPLC. According to him
this included a loan of US$ 50 million, which came to NNPLC as a loan from
NDTV BV and was in fact was out of subscription money received from NBCU. In
view of this statement of the Director of company who was at the helm of the
affairs we do not have any option but to set aside this ground of cross
objection back to the file of the ld Assessing Officer with a direction to
make a proper enquiry with respect to the loan of US$50 million. The ld
Assessing Officer is further directed to carry enquiry also with respect to
the fact that whether this loan amount was also out of subscription sum
received from NBCU and is part of the total consideration of Rs. 642 crore to
avoid any duplication of addition in the interest of justice. The assessee is
also directed to submit the complete explanation with respect to the above
loan with exhaustive evidences before the ld Assessing Officer. Needless to
say that ld Assessing Officer after enquiry as deem fit confront the assessee
with the result of the enquiry and after seeking the explanation of the
assessee deal with the issue in accordance with the law. In the result ground
No. 9 of the cross objection of the assessee is allowed with above direction.
124\. Ground No. 10 of the CO is against the direction of the ld DRP stating
that it has exceed its jurisdiction while directing the ld Assessing Officer
to enhance the variation as a result of further enquiry in respect of loan
transaction between NDTV Network PLC UK and NDTV Networks BV as such direction
is outside the purview of the powers of the ld DRP. It was further contested
that the ld DRP ought not to have issued any direction for taxing new source
of income, which is emanating from the draft assessment order.
125\. We have carefully considered the ground of cross objection as well as
the argument of the assessee. According to the provision of section 144C(a)
the Dispute Resolution Panel has power for enhancement to the variation
proposed and further explanation added therein by the Finance Act 2012 with
retrospective effect from  373 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, 01.04.2009
also provides that the ld DRP has power to enhance the variation on any matter
arising out of assessment proceedings relating to the draft order.
Notwithstanding that such matter was raised or not by the eligible assessee.
In view of this we dismiss ground No. 10 of the cross objection.
126\. Ground No. 11 of the cross objection is with respect to the addition of

submitted that out of the above investments, Rs. 6.97 crores is share
application money against which shares are yet to be allotted (S. No 5 & 6).
Accordingly, no exempt income can be earned. Further, a sum of Rs. 57.46 lacs
was invested in shares of foreign companies, the dividend from which is not
exempt under the provisions of the Act (S.No.3, 5 & 7). It was submitted that
the balance investments were made out of retained earnings and were made in
prior years, and those made in the year in question were also made out of
retained earnings 38.3 The assessee incurred an interest expense of Rs.
14,64,77,381/-, out of which Rs. 421,22,422/- was incurred against the term
loans, which can be utilized for specific purposes only. Further, there no
expenditure incurred directly or indirectly in respect of making an
investments in the shares of the above company. Therefore, the provisions of
section 14A read with Rule 8D are not applicable on the facts of the case.
38.4 Here, the assessee respectfully submits that in order to invoke
provisions of section 14A of the Act, the assessee had to incur any expense in
relation to the investments from which an exempt income is earned.
38.5 A tabular chart stating the basis of the disputed addition and
contentions of the appellant is given below.
Re: Disallowance u/s 14A Basis adopted for making the addition or Appellant's
rebuttal submission disallowance In the draft order (i) The assessee has
submit The Ld.AO applied provisions of section 14A read there is no
expenditure incurred with Rule 8D and made disallowance under clause or
indirectly in connection with (B) & (C) of Rule 8D i.e. proportionate
disallowance of of an exempt income. interest expense paid on term loan for
working capital and 0.5% of average investment held during the year The
appellant also submitted  375 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, aggregating
to Rs. 78,40,990/- AO had failed to record his sat that expense had been
incurred an exempt income.
In the final order The DRP had rejected the contention of the appellant The
DRP had erred in law on application of section 14A read with Rule 8D and
accepting the contention further, directed the AO to record his satisfaction
appellant that no expenditu (please refer to para 9 at page 30 of the appeal
set) incurred directly or indirectly appellant to earn an exempt The AO in
pursuance of the directions of DRP and had also erred in directing recorded
his satisfaction wherein he stated that the to record his satisfaction and
claim of the appellant that no managerial expenses as per section 14A of the
Act. were incurred could not be accepted as the appellant The satisfaction
recorded by th is using the common infrastructure and common devoid of any
merit as it fails to personnel for earning an exempt income from the record
that the appellant had mutual funds (appellant had not invested in any any
expenses or interest c mutual funds). earning an exempt income.
38.6 The appellant submits that no disallowance was made under section 14A of
the Act till AY 2007-08 by the Ld AO in the assessments completed u/s 143 (3)
of the Act and therefore, the investments made prior to AY 2007-08 should not
have been considered at all by the AO while making a disallowance u/s 14A of
the Act for the year under consideration. It is further submitted that the
investments were made by the Appellant in its group companies on account of
the business expediency as the same were engaged in the same line of business.
38.7 In view of the above, the appellant places reliance on the decision of
the Chandigarh Tribunal in the case of Spray Engineering Devices Ltd. reported
in 23 taxmann.com 267 (Chd.) wherein the Honourable Tribunal has accepted the
plea of the Appellant that the investments being made in the course of
business do not warrant any disallowance under section 14A of the Act in view
of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.A. Builders Ltd.
reported in 288 ITR 1. In this regard, the Tribunal has made the following
observation.
―.....Once the assessee has been found to have made a business investment by
way of shares in related line of business, the said investment though held by
way of shares in the said company cannot be subjected to disallowance under
section 14A of the Act, which in any case is relatable to disallowance of the
expenditure out of the exempt income earned by the Appellant, by way of its
investment in shares of other company.‖ 38.8 Further, the appellant also
submits that the AO failed to appreciate that the investments made in the
share capital were from the retained earnings and no borrowing whatsoever had
been made to make such investments. Therefore, in light of judgement in the
case of East India Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax
reported in 224 ITR 627 (SC) and Woolcombers of India Ltd. vs. Commissioner of
Income Tax (Central) reported in 134 ITR 219, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
the case of CIT vs. Reliance Utilities and power Ltd. reported in 313 ITR 340
held that as under:
> ―If there be interest free funds available to an assessee sufficient to meet
> its investments and at the same time the assesssee had raised a loan it can
> be presumed that the investments were from the interest free funds
> available. In our opinion the Supreme Court in East India Pharmaceutical
> Works Ltd. (supra) had the occasion to consider the  376 ITA No.

> the above, appellant prays that no disallowance u/s 14A of the Act read with
> clause (B) & (C) of Rule 8D is warranted.
38.10 The assessee is the ultimate holding company of the various group
companies and had made investments in the earlier years in the group companies
and others through its internal accruals only and not from the borrowings on
which interest is paid. Accordingly, the assessee in the return of income did
not make any disallowance under section 14A of the Act read with Rule 8D of
the Income Tax Rules, 1962.
38.11 It was further stated that the balance investments were made out of
retained earnings and were made in prior years, and those made in the year in
question were also made out of retained earnings. During the year the assessee
had incurred an interest expense of Rs. 14,64,77,381/- out of which Rs.
421,22,422/- was incurred against the term loans, which could be utilized for
specific purposes only and not for investments. Further, the remaining
interest has been paid in relation to loans taken for working capital
requirements and other expenses and no amount of interest bearing fund is
utilized for making the investments in shares whose income is exempt so as to
warrant any disallowance under section 14A of the Act.
38.12 The Ld. AO in complete disregard of above facts and on surmises observed
that since the assessee has made investments in shares and the income from
which in the form of dividend is tax exempt, therefore, the interest paid and
other administrative cost were incurred by the assessee to earn such tax free
income. Accordingly, the provisions of section 14A were attracted and in the
absence of identification of such expenses recourse was taken to Rule 8D of
the Rules. 38.13 The applicant being aggrieved with the above addition filed
its objections before the Hon'ble DRP wherein it was submitted that in order
to invoke provisions of section 14A of the Act following conditions need to be
satisfied i.e.  Income should be earned during the year and such income
should not form part of total income and;
 Expenditure should have been incurred towards earning such income (claimed
as deduction).
38.14 The applicant further submitted that it was also imperative for the
Ld.AO to establish a direct or indirect nexus between expenditure alleged to
have been incurred and exempt income. Thus, merely because the assessee made
an investment in shares would not per se give rise to vague suspicion that for
making investment there is an expenditure incurred. In order to invoke
provisions of section 14A of the Act, the assessing officer ought to record
his satisfaction that the claim of the assessee that no expenses were incurred
in relation to making investments in shares is incorrect before applying the
provisions of Rule 8D of the  377 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O.
No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, Rules.
38.15 In this regard, reliance was placed on the following judicial
precedents;
 326 ITR 1 (SC) CIT vs. Walfort Share and Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd.  347 ITR
272 (Del.) Maxopp Investment Limited vs. CIT 38.16 Further, the allegation in
the assessment order is devoid of any merit as the Ld.
AO failed to appreciate that the majority of investments were made in prior
years out of the accumulated reserves and capital, and there could not be any
administrative cost incurred during the year as there was no material movement
in portfolio of investment in shares of group companies and the investments
were made in order to maintain majority stake in such companies, and
therefore, no disallowance could be made under section 14A of the Act.
38.17 Reliance was also placed on the following judicial precedents;
                  323 ITR 518 (P&H) CIT vs. Hero Cycles Ltd.
                  319 ITR 204 (P&H) CIT vs. Winsome Textile Industries Ltd.
38.18 The Hon'ble DRP has exceeded its jurisdiction and erred in directing the
Ld. AO to record his reasons before invoking the Rule 8D of the Income Tax
Rules, 1962 and proceed as per section 14A of the Act without first disposing
off the issue of applicability of section 14A of the Act on merits as raised
by the Applicant in the proceedings before the Hon'ble DRP.
38.19 The applicant most respectfully submits that on the facts of the present
case no addition is warranted under section 14A of the Act in light of the
submissions made above. In addition to the above, it is most respectfully
submitted that the majority of investments were made by the assessee company
in its subsidiaries to acquire majority stake in furtherance of its business
objectives in media space, therefore, such strategic investments cannot be
deemed to have made for earning dividends and no addition whatsoever could be
made under section 14A of the Act.
38.20 Apart from the above it is also submitted that mechanical and, erroneous
application of section 14A of the Act is not tenable. The appellant in support
of the above, seeks to rely upon the following judgments:
i) 360 ITR 68 (Del) CIT vs. M/s Hero Management Service Ltd. ―4. The assessee
had made investment of Rs.2,44,71,261/- in mutual funds. The substantial
investment of Rs.2 crores was made, as noticed above, from share allotment
money. Dividend of Rs.3,95,439 was received from this fund. Dividend of
Rs.153/- and Rs.1649/- was received from two mutual funds. Thus in all
dividend income of Rs.3,97,241/- was received. The assessee had himself
disallowed an amount of Rs.99,310/- under Section 14A. The tribunal has held
that the aforesaid disallowance was reasonable. The Assessing Officer had
disallowed an amount of Rs.69,65,686/- and held this was the reasonable
expenditure incurred to earn dividend income of Rs.3,95,439/-. In view of the
facts noticed above, the contention of the revenue is rather far-fetched, if
not perverse and illogical.
5\. Calculation mistakes while applying Rule 8D were pointed out by the
respondent-assessee, but these have not been adverted to in view of the
findings recorded by the tribunal on merit. Rule 8D is not retrospective as
held by this Court in Maxopp Investment Limited v. CIT, (2012) 347 ITR 272
(Del.). Further to invoke Rule 8D, the Assessing Officer has to first record a
finding that he was not satisfied with the correctness of the claim for
expenditure made by the assessee in relation to income, which did not form
part of the total income under the Act. No  378 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 &
2658/Del/2014 C.O. No. 233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television
Ltd, Vs.ACIT, such satisfaction has been recorded by the Assessing Officer.‖
[Emphasis supplied]
ii) 347 ITR 272 (Del) Maxopp Investment Ltd. vs. CIT ―The expression ―in
relation to ―does not have any embedded object. It simply means ―in connection
with‖ or ―pertains to‖. If the expenditure en question has a relation or
connection with or pertains to exempt income it cannot be allowed as a
deduction even if it qualifies under other provisions of the Act. The actual
expenditure that is in contemplation under section 14A(1) f the Act is the
―actual‖ expenditure in relation to or in connection with or pertaining to
exempt income. The corollary to this is that if no expenditure is incurred in
relation to the exempt income, no disallowance can be made under section 14A
of the Act‖

viii) 140 TTJ 73 (Cal) Balarampur Chini Mills Ltd. vs. DCIT ―8. Here in the
present case, there is no linkage or nexus between the funds borrowed by
assessee and the impugned investments, hence, no interest expenditure can be
disallowed by mechanically applying the Provisions of Rule 8D of the Rules.
The assessee has explained that the share capital and reserves, that is its
own funds, were utilised for the purpose of investment in shares for earning
dividend income and this has not been negated by lower authorities i.e.
neither CIT(A) nor AO. The assessee has explained each and every investment
with sources of funds and its utilization as well as opening application of
funds and closing application of funds as noted above. It is an admitted
position in law that expenditure can be disallowed U/s.14A of the Act if and
only if it is incurred in relation to income which does not form part of total
income. From the facts of the present case, it is clear that there is no link
with expenditure for earning of dividend income incurred by the assessee and
once the facts are clear, no disallowance can be made by invoking rule 8D of
the Rules. Neither the AO nor CIT(A) has recorded any finding that having
regard to the account of the assessee, they are not satisfied with the
correctness of the claim of expenditure made by assessee or the claim made by
assessee that no expenditure has been incurred in relation to income which do
not form part of the total income under the Act for the relevant assessment
year. In the absence of any such finding, facts of the present case shows that
the investment in shares was made out of own capital employed and not from
borrowed funds, no disallowance on account of interest expenditure can be made
by invoking rule 8D of the Rules. Accordingly, in the given facts and
circumstances, we delete the addition and allow this issue of assessee's
appeal.‖

ought not to be invoked in the Applicant's case and the proposed disallowance
deserves to be deleted.
38.23 In view of the aforesaid, the disallowance made of Rs. 78,40,990/- may
kindly be deleted.
129\. The ld DR submitted that AO has recorded his satisfaction about the
assessee‟s calculation and therefore his conclusion would not be rejected. For
this, he relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of
Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd. Vs. DCIT 76 Taxmann.com 268. He further
relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Godrej and Boyce
Manufacturing Co. Ltd Vs. DCIT 81 Taxmann.com 117. In the end, he submitted
that the matter must be set aside to the file of the AO.
130\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and have also
considered the reasons recorded by the ld Assessing Officer vide para No. 5.2
of the final order. The ld Assessing Officer has recorded the satisfaction as
under:-
> ―5.2 On this issue, it is observed that no managerial expenses in respect of
> investment made by the assessee in group companies and other companies have
> been reflected or disallowed and offered for taxation. The assessee has
> claimed having incurred Nil expenditure in respect of these investments.
It is pertinent to mention here that the assessee company has common  380 ITA

Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, infrastructure and common personnel for earning
income under various heads, but still, no separate expenditure was booked for
earning the exempt income comprised in the mutual funds. Therefore, it is fair
and reasonable to conclude that the assessee has earned both exempt as well as
taxable income by using common facilities and common manpower. Hence, it
cannot be said that no part of expenditure was incurred to receive income
under any particular head. In the absence of separate accounts being
maintained by the assessee, the expenditure in relation to the income, which
does not form part of total income, has been worked out on the basis of
guidelines provided in Notification No. 45/2008 dated 24.03.2008 and the
method prescribed under Rule 8D of I.Tax Rules, which has not been objected by
the assessee, as recorded by the DRP in its directions, and which is as
summarized as follows :-

The assessee has claimed having incurred Nil expenditure in respect of these investments. It is pertinent to mention here that the assessee company has common infrastructure and common personnel for earning income under various heads, but still, no separate expenditure was booked for earning the exempt income comprised in the mutual funds.

131\. In view of the above of the ld Assessing Officer that the assessee has
not been disallowed any expenditure and further the Nil expenditure could not
have been incurred in relation to exempt income because of common
infrastructure and expenditure. Therefore, relying on the decision of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd Vs. DCIT(supra)
the disallowance is required to be made u/s 14A of the Act. Further, the
income of the dividend income from the foreign subsidiary is not exempt.
Therefore, that investment must not be included while working disallowance u/s
14A. further, if the assessee has tax-free funds available more than the
amount of investment then no disallowance with respect to the interest
expenditure can be made of the nexus is not proved by the Assessing Officer.
in view of all these facts in the interest of justice we set aside the issue
of disallowance u/s 14A back to the file of the ld AO with a direction to
recomputed disallowance after giving assessee a reasonable opportunity of
hearing. The assessee is also eligible to raise relevant contention and submit
the relevant details to support its claim. In view of this ground No. 11 of
the cross objection is allowed accordingly.
132\. Ground No. 12, 13 of the appeal are with respect to computation of arms
length price with respect to the business support services where the ALP was
determined an adjustment of Rs. 7463229/- was made. The contention of the
assessee is that price received was Rs. 74687177/- is taken instead of Rs.
75277881/-. The ld AR  383 ITA No. 1212/Del/2014 & 2658/Del/2014 C.O. No.
233/Del/2014 (AY: 2009-10 M/s. New Delhi Television Ltd, Vs.ACIT, submitted
that assessee has been denied the benefit of working capital benefit while
considering the adjustment. He further submitted that the objection were
raised before the ld Dispute Resolution Panel, however, same were not
considered by the ld DRP.
133\. The ld DR fairly agreed that if the assessee is entitled for working
capital adjustment then the ld Transfer Pricing Officer may be given an
opportunity to examine the claim of the assessee and if same is found in
accordance with the law then it may be granted.
134\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The only claim of
the assessee is to grant assessee the adjustment on account of working
capital. The ld DR has also fairly agreed to that. Therefore, we set aside
ground Nos 12 and 13 of the appeal of the assessee back to the file of the ld
TPO with a direction to the assessee to submit the details of working capital
adjustment to the ld Transfer Pricing Officer and if the ld TPO find it after
examination in accordance with the law then same may be granted to the
assessee. In the result ground Ns. 12 and 13 of the cross objection are
allowed with above direction.
135\. Ground No. 14 of the appeal is with regard to an addition of Rs.
43502400/- in respect of alleged international transaction of provision of
corporate guarantee on the ground that appellant has been compensated from
providing such alleged guarantee. The assessee has also challenged that merely
giving an undertaking to provide guarantee on behalf of its associated
enterprise does not amount to providing any guarantee.
136\. Bothe the parties agreed that whether corporate guarantee is an
international transaction or not is a matter pending before the Special Bench
of the Tribunal. In view of this both the parties requested to setting aside
this ground of appeal to file of TPO with a direction to decide after the
order of the Special Bench.
137\. We have carefully considered the request of both the parties, which is
fair and proper. As the matter is pending before the special bench it would
also not be proper for us to decide the issue now. in view of this we set
aside this ground of cross objection of the assessee to the file of the ld TPO
with a direction to decide the issue after the decision of the Special Bench
of tribunal. In the result ground No. 14 of the CO is allowed with above
direction.

138\. Ground No. 15, 16 and 17 are with respect of charging of interest u/s
234B and 234D of the Act, withdrawal of interest u/s 244A of the Act and
initiation of penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act respectively.
139\. Both the parties agreed before us that all the three above grounds of
the cross objection are consequential to the determination of income of the
assessee. Therefore, these grounds may be dismissed.
140\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and we agree with the
agreement of the parties that above three grounds of cross objection are
consequential in nature. Therefore, we dismiss them.
141\. In the result, cross objection filed by the assessee succeeds partly.
142\. In the end, we are expressing our sincere gratitude to the Ld Counsel
