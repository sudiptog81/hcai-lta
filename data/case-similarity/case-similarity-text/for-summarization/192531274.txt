Plaintiff's carton does not arise.
48\. In any event, before considering the features of the rival cartons, the
Court must satisfy itself that the rival word marks are visually similar, and
only when it is satisfied, the Court may go on to consider whether the added
matter upon the Defendant's carton out-weighs the impression created by the
visual similarity of the marks themselves. I have observed hereinbefore that
the rival word marks are not similar. There is no visual or phonetic
similarity between the word marks. Hence, the question of considering the
similarities between the rival cartons, as suggested by the Plaintiff, does
not arise. In any event, even if I was to consider both the cartons, I do not
feel that both are so similar so as to outweigh the impression of
dissimilarity created by the rival word marks and thereby create any confusion
or deception.  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019

    JUDGMENT :
1\. The present Suit is filed by the Plaintiff against the Defendants for
infringement of the Plaintiff's registered trade marks "PANDERM" and "PANDERM
+" bearing registration Nos.1309828 and 1849407 respectively both in Class 5
and passing off. The Plaintiff has inter alia sought a permanent order and
injunction against the Defendant from using the trade mark POLYDERM +, which
according to the Plaintiff is deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's
registered trade marks. Prayer clause (a) of the Plaint is reproduced
hereunder:
> "(a) That the Defendants by itself, its servants and agents be restrained by
> a perpetual order and injunction of this Hon'ble Court from in any manner
> using in relation to medicinal preparations or any products of the Defendant
> under the impugned trade mark "POLYDERM+" (Exhibit "F" hereto) or any other
> deceptively similar trade mark similar to the Plaintiff's trade mark so as
> to infringe the Plaintiff's trademarks, "PANDERM" and "PANDERM +'' and to
> pass off or enable others to pass off the Defendants' product as and for the
> products of the Plaintiff's"
2\. Since the beginning of this Suit, the Defendants have neither entered
their appearance, nor contested the Suit, nor the Notice of Motion, despite
the service of papers and proceedings and Writ of Summons upon them. The
Defendants have not filed any Written Statement. In view thereof, the Suit has
proceeded ex- parte. There is no ad-interim or interim injunction order
operating against the  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on -
10/07/2019 01:30:20 ::: Nitin 3 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc Defendants till date.
Though, the Plaintiff had moved an application seeking ad- interim injunction
against the Defendants, this Court ( S.J. Vazifdar, J. as he then was), vide
its Order dated 14 th June 2011, refused to grant ad-interim injunction in
favour of the Plaintiff solely on the ground that the two rival marks PANDERM
and POLYDERM are not deceptively similar. When this Suit came up before me for
hearing for the first time, I had expressed my first impression that - there
is no similarity between the rival trade marks PANDERM and POLYDERM. Mr. Behl,
Ld. Advocate for the Plaintiff, however, insisted that I should reconsider the
aspect of similarity between the rival trade marks particularly in view of the
fact that the Defendant has not contested the Suit at all, to which I agreed.
3\. The heart and soul of any trade mark dispute, such as the present one, is
mostly dependent upon one and only one aspect i.e. whether the trade mark used
by the Defendant is identical with and / or closely and / or deceptively
similar to the Plaintiff 's trade mark and consequently whether there is a
possibility of confusion or deception . If ultimately, it is held that there
is no deceptive similarity between the rival trade marks, then the matter
really ends there and the question of confusion or deception does not arise.
No amount of evidence adduced to show prior user or reputation of the
Plaintiff's mark can be of assistance to the Plaintiff in such a situation
since the whole basis of an infringement and / or passing off action, such as
the present  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019
01:30:20 ::: Nitin 4 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc one, is dependent on the Court
coming to a conclusion that there is deceptive similarity between the rival
trade marks. If the rival trade marks are held not to be identical or
deceptively similar, there cannot be any cause of action for either
infringement or passing off.
4\. Considering the fact that the Defendants have not been represented in this
matter and in order to ensure that all the principles of trade mark law are
put before the Court from the perspective of both the sides, this Court, on 22
nd January 2019 appointed Mr. Hiren Kamod, Counsel to assist the Court as
Amicus Curiae in the present matter.
5\. On 5th March 2019, I heard Mr. Behl, Ld. Advocate for the Plaintiff and
Mr. Kamod, Ld. Amicus Curiae in detail, and the matter was reserved for
orders. PLAINTIFF'S SUBMISSIONS :
6\. The Plaintiff is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of
pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations. The present proceedings pertain to
dermatological ointments manufactured and sold by the Plaintiff and the
Defendants under the trade marks PANDERM / PANDERM + and POLYDERM +,
respectively. The rival products seem to have similar molecular compositions
and are used in the treatment of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria.
7\. As per the Plaintiff, in or about the year 2004-05, the Plaintiff honestly
conceived and adopted the trade mark "PANDERM" for its dermatological
preparations. In or about the year 2009-10, the Plaintiff conceived and
adopted the  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019
01:30:20 ::: Nitin 5 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc trademark "PANDERM'' wherein the
symbol "+" signifies the positive results from application of the Plaintiff's
product. According to the Plaintiff, PANDERM / PANDERM + is an original word
that has been coined by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff derived the trade mark
PANDERM by combining the Latin word "PANDEMUS" which means "of all people" and
the word "DERMATOLOGY" i.e. the branch of medicine concerned with the
physiology and pathology of the skin and treatment of skin diseases. The
trademark "PANDERM" suggests "a treatment for the skin diseases / ailments of
all the people". It is stated that on or about 20 th September 2004 the
Plaintiff applied for and secured registration of its trade mark PANDERM
bearing Registration No.1309828 in Class 5. On 11 th August 2009, the
Plaintiff applied for and secured registration of the trade mark PANDERM +
bearing Registration No.1849407 in Class 5.
8\. In or about February 2011, the Plaintiff learnt that the Defendants are
manufacturing and marketing the impugned product bearing the impugned trade
mark "POLYDERM +". Hence, the Plaintiff filed the present Suit.
9\. The Plaintiff has led its evidence by filing Affidavit in lieu of
Examination-in- Chief dated 10th August 2013 of Mr. Vivekanand Mukherjee,
Marketing Manager of the Plaintiff; Affidavit in lieu of Examination in Chief
dated 30 th March 2013 of Mr. Nitesh Srivastava, Senior General Manager of the
Plaintiff; Affidavit in lieu of Examination in Chief dated 30th March 2013 of
Mr. Vinayak Shirodkar, Vice President, Accounts and Finance of the Plaintiff.
Through the said evidence, various documents  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 :::
Downloaded on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20 ::: Nitin 6 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc were
tendered in Court which are taken on record and marked Exhibit-X collectively.
10\. Mr. Behl, Ld. Advocate for the Plaintiff submitted that the impugned
trade mark "POLYDERM+" is identical with and / or deceptively similar to the
Plaintiff's trade marks PANDERM / PANDERM+. He submitted that the rival marks
are phonetically, visually and structurally identical and / or deceptively
similar. He submitted that the packaging / trade dress of the Defendant's
impugned product is also same as that of the Plaintiff's product. He pointed
out the similarities between the rival packaging / trade dress, details of
which are more particularly provided in paragraph 14 of the Plaint. He
submitted that both, the Plaintiff and the Defendant's, products are Schedule
H drugs. He submitted that this is a cause for concern, as vulnerable patients
would be facing the risk of using the Defendants' product believing the same
to be of the same quality and efficacy as that of the Plaintiff.
11\. Mr. Behl submitted that since the Defendants are in the same business as
that of the Plaintiff, they ought to have been aware of the Plaintiff's goods
bearing the trade marks PANDERM / PANDERM+ when the Defendants adopted the
said trade mark. He submitted that a man of ordinary intelligence and
imperfect recollection is likely to be confused between the Plaintiff's trade
mark PANDERM / PANDERM + and the Defendants' trade mark POLYDERM +. He
submitted that the Defendants have made a deliberate attempt to infringe upon
the Plaintiff's trade mark by placing its logo, name and address in the same
position and style as that of the Plaintiff. He submitted that despite having
a chemical composition identical to that of the Plaintiff, the  ::: Uploaded

COMIP-32-2011-F.doc Defendants' product is not stated to be a Schedule H drug
on its packaging. He submitted that the unsuspecting consumers who purchase
the Defendants' products, risk suffering side effects and health
complications.
12\. Mr. Behl highlighted the following features of the rival cartons, which
according to the Plaintiff are deceptively similar and / or identical to its
carton :
> a. The placement of the mark PANDERM / PANDERM+ viz.a.viz.
> POLYDERM+, on the top left of the carton / tube.
> b. The font of the rival marks as written, both in the English language and
> in the Devnagiri script.
> c. The manner and style in which the trading names of the Plaintiff i.e.
> (MACLEOD with barcode design below) and the Defendant (PIECIES with barcode
> design below) are both written on the top right of their respective cartons
> / tubes.
> d. The manner in which the trade marks and trading names of the Plaintiff
> and the Defendant appear on the flap of their respective cartons.
> e. The "swoosh line" below the trade mark PANDERM / PANDERM+ and an almost
> identical wavy line embellishment below the trade mark of the Defendants'
> POLYDERM+.
> f. The "+" sign following the trade mark POLYDERM is placed in a manner

13\. Mr. Behl relied upon the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Corn
Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Product Ltd. 1 He submitted that in
this case it was held that in an infringement action the test was of first
impression, rather than of skilled / experienced judge or lawyer; that the
view of an "ordinary man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection"
must be applied. He submitted that applying the same test, an ordinary man of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection is unlikely to recall any
difference between the rival marks especially due to the similarity between
the cartons / labels and the composition of the products.
14\. Mr. Behl also relied upon the Supreme Court's decision in the case of
Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta 2. He submitted that in this case the
Superme Court held that Courts must consider "the idea behind the mark", its
etymology and the manner in which this idea behind the mark is likely to be
assessed by an ordinary man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection
in the Indian scenario. The relevant excerpts relied upon by the Ld. Advocate
for the Plaintiff are reproduced below:

"8.... It is not disputed before us that the two names 'Amritdhara' and
'Lakshmandhara' are in use in respect of the same description of goods,
namely, a medicinal preparation for the alleviation of various ailments. Such
medicinal preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of going
to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick alleviation of their
suffering, both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As we
said in Corn Products Refining v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. [1960] 1 SCR
968 , the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall
structural and phonetic similarity of the two names 'Amritdhara' and
'Lakshmandhara' is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We
must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words 'Amritdhara'
and 'Lakshmandhara'. We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court
were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary
purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the
High Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and consider the
etymological meaning thereof or even consider meanings of the composite words
as 'current of nectar' or 'current of Lakshman'. He would go more by the
overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he
has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise
learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods
largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to say
that a  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20
::: Nitin 10 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc person educated in the Hindi language
would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and, see the difference
between 'current of nectar' and 'current of Lakshman'. Current of Lakshman in
a literal sense has no meaning to give it meaning one must further make the
inference that the 'current or stream' is as pure and strong as Lakshman of
the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsmen will perhaps know
Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being familiar to him, but we doubt if he
would etymologine to the extent of seeing the so called ideological difference
between 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara'. He would go more by the similarity
of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation
which he wants for his ailments.
9\. We agree that the use of the word 'dhara' which literally means 'current
or stream' is not by itself decisive of the matter. What we have to consider
here is the overall similarity of the composite words, having regard to the
circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations
of the same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to
be refused, because unusually stupid people, "fools or idiots", may be
deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of
difference, but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names
having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat
vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous
occasion with a similar name.  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on

                         ..."
15\. Mr. Behl relied upon a Judgment of the High Court of Madras in the case
of Wockhardt Limited v. Aristo Pharmaceuticals Limited 3\. He submitted that
in this case the Madras High Court has appreciated the likelihood of the
mispronunciation of the letters "P" and "F". He submitted that an ordinary man
of average intelligence and imperfect recollection is not going to pause and
attempt to assess whether there is any phonetic similarity / dissimilarity
between the rival trade marks or that the Defendants' product is the same as
the Plaintiff's product.
16\. Relying upon the Supreme Court's decision in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 4, Mr.Behl submitted that the slight difference in
spelling between the rival marks may not be noticed by customers who come to
purchase the Plaintiff's medicine. He submitted that there is every likelihood
of confusion and a customer is very likely to purchase the Defendants'
products believing it to be that of the Plaintiff's.
17\. Relying upon the Delhi High Court's decision in Glaxo Group Ltd. & Anr.
v. Paun & Paum Chemicals 5, Mr. Behl submitted that to a person of average
intelligence and imperfect recollection, the overall structural similarity
between the rival marks is likely to cause confusion, especially when the
cartons are similar in all respects.

6 He submitted that in this case it was held that to consider visual or
phonetical similarity, the entire word as a whole must be considered. He
submitted that the Defendant by changing a few letters in its trade mark is
trying to cash upon the reputation which has been built by the Plaintiff over
the years.
19\. Mr.Behl further submitted that a Division Bench of this Court in the case
of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited v. Wyeth Holdings Corporation and
Ors. 7 had held that the trade mark PACITANE of the respondent therein was
deceptively similar to the trade mark of the appellant PARKITANE even after
holding that the prefixes "Pace", "Par" and "Paki" and suffixes "Tan,"
"Thane", "Ten" and "Teen" are common to the trade.
20\. He also relied upon this Court's decision in Encore Electronics Ltd. v.
Anchor Electronics & Electricals Pvt. Ltd. 8 He submitted that in this case it
was held that phonetic and visual similarities constitute an important index
as to whether a mark is deceptive and misleading.
SUBMISSIONS OF AMICUS CURIAE :
21\. Mr. Kamod the Learned Amicus Curiae, at the outset made submissions on
the general principles in relation to the law of 'deceptive similarity' of
trade marks. He submitted that both at the stage of interim and final relief,
the matter rests on first impression itself. He submitted that trade marks are
remembered rather by general 6 2004 (28) PTC 456 (Del) 7 2005 (30) PTC 14

impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic
recollection of the whole. He submitted that it is important to find out what
is the distinguishing or essential feature of the Plaintiff's trade mark and
what is the main feature or the main idea underlying that trade mark, and
ascertain if the Defendant's trade mark contains the same distinctive or
essential feature, or conveys the same idea. He submitted that in deciding the
question of similarity between the two marks, the approach must be from the
point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. He
submitted that marks must be compared as a whole. He submitted that the true
test is whether the totality of the Defendants' trade mark is such that it is
likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of persons
accustomed to the existing trade mark. He submitted that while ascertaining
the question of deceptive similarity, the Courts must not conduct a
microscopic examination and both the visual and the phonetic tests must be
applied. He submitted that the nature of the commodity, the class of
purchasers, the mode of purchase and other surrounding circumstances must also
be considered. He submitted that the prefix in a mark is important and the
first syllable is considered to be an important factor in deciding the
phonetic similarity between the two trade marks.
22\. Mr.Kamod submitted that if the settled principles of trade mark law are
applied to the present case, the rival marks PANDERM and POLYDERM cannot be
said to be deceptively similar. He submitted that the Plaintiff's mark
consists of 2 syllables i.e. PAN + DERM, whereas, the Defendants' trade mark
consists of 3 syllables i.e. PO +  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded
on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20 ::: Nitin 14 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc LY + DERM. He
submitted that though the marks are always to be compared as whole, the first
syllable of a word mark is generally the most important one as there is a
tendency of person using the English language to slur the termination of
words. He relied upon the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Johann A. Wulfing v. Chemical Industrial and Pharmaceutical
Laboratories Limited and Ors. 9 The relevant excerpts relied upon by him are
reproduced below:

He submitted that DERM is a common suffix in the pharmaceutical industry with
respect to dermatological products and it is very likely that the Defendants
have adopted their suffix DERM from the same word. Relying upon the Supreme
Court's decision in F. Hoffmann-la Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner & Co.
Pvt. Ltd. 10, he submitted that in such circumstances the first syllable is of
greater importance. The relevant excerpt from the said judgment is reproduced
below:

R.P.C. 65 the House of Lords was considering the resemblance between the two
words "Aristoc" and "Rysta". The view taken was that considering the way the
words were pronounced in English, the one was likely to be mistaken for the
other. Viscount Maugham cited the following passage of Lord Justice Luxmoore
in the Court of Appeal, which passage, he said, he completely accepted as the
correct exposition of the law :
> The answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too
> nearly the sound of another so as to bring the former within the limits of
> Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act, 1938, must nearly always depend on first
> impression, It is also important that the marks must be compared as wholes.
It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that
portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the
other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test
is whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it is likely
to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of persons accustomed
to the existing trade mark. Thus in Layroma case, Tokalon Ltd. v. Davidson &
Co. 32 R.P.C.133 Lord Johnston said :

The letters 'D' and 'P' in "DROPOVIT" and the corresponding letters 'P' and
'T' in "PROTOVIT" cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the
words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion
between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view."

drugs, or parts of body organs, or the branch of science to which they belong,

26\. Mr. Kamod submitted that when a trade mark is formed from the common
generic name or the branch of science to which they belong, no single
proprietor can claim absolute monopoly in such name or trade mark. He
submitted that when the Plaintiff adopted the trade mark PANDERM on the basis
of the branch of science to which its products belong viz. DERMATOLOGY, the
Plaintiff ought to have been aware that the other proprietors are also likely
to adopt and use similar marks in case their product is also based on
DERMATOLOGY. He submitted that when two trade marks are coined on the basis of
the branch of science to which they belong, there are bound to be similarities
between the two, and in such a case even if the differences between the two
trade marks are minor or small, then also no injunction ought to be granted.
He relied upon the case of Schering Corporation v. United Biotech (P) Ltd. 13
Mr. Kamod submitted that though this Judgment was passed in the context of a
passing off action, the principle would apply even to an infringement action.

29\. On the aspect of similarity in the packaging of the rival products, Mr.
Kamod submitted that the Plaintiff in this Suit is praying for relief against
infringement and passing off on the basis of its word mark PANDERM / PANDERM +
bearing Registration Nos. 1309828 and 1849407 both in Class 5. The Plaintiff
has pleaded 14 Unreported Judgment - DB - Bombay High Court dated 12th June

proprietary and statutory right in the word mark PANDERM / PANDERM+. He
submitted that the Plaintiff has neither pleaded nor claimed, let alone proved
any proprietary rights, in its packaging or trade dress. He submitted that the
Plaintiff's Plaint and evidence is devoid of any pleadings / statements
wherein it pleads or claims a proprietary right in its packaging / trade
dress/carton. He submitted that there may be several others before the
Plaintiff using the same or similar carton or packaging, and that in order to
claim any kind of proprietary right over the packaging, carton or trade dress,
the least the Plaintiff could have done was to plead that its carton or
packaging or trade dress is unique, or that the Plaintiff has acquired common
law right/proprietary right in respect of the same. To substantiate the
submissions, he drew my attention to the Plaint alongwith the prayers therein
and the Evidence Affidavits filed by the Plaintiff.
30\. He further submitted that considering the nature of the products involved
i.e. medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations - Scheduled H Drug, coupled
with the case of the Plaintiff in the Plaint and Evidence Affidavits, the
similarity if any, between the packaging / trade dress of rival products, is
of no consequence to the reliefs prayed for in the present Suit. He submitted
that the issue that requires adjudication is whether the Defendants' by using
the wordmark POLYDERM + are infringing the Plaintiff's registered trade marks
PANDERM / PANDERM+, and passing off their goods as and for those of the
Plaintiff.

was  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20 :::
Nitin 25 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc that the rival trade marks are completely
dissimilar, both visually and phonetically and even at the conclusion of the
hearing, I am of the opinion that there is no similarity in the Plaintiff's
trade marks PANDERM/PANDERM+ and Defendants' trade mark POLYDERM. Though the
Plaintiff has led evidence to establish its statutory right in its trade mark
PANDERM / PANDERM+ and the goodwill and reputation acquired therein, which I
must state is uncontroverted in view of the fact that the Defendants have
chosen not to contest the Suit, I am of the opinion that the Plaintiff is not
entitled to the reliefs as prayed for, in view of my reasoning given
hereunder.
32\. The question of deceptive similarity between the two trade marks arises
in the following proceedings:

The Apex Court has also observed that "Weightage is to be given to each of the
aforesaid factors depending upon the facts of each case and the same weightage
cannot be given to each factor in every case."
34\. The weightage that is required to be given to the factors enumerated by
the Supreme Court in Cadila case (supra) differs from case to case. In case of
pharmaceutical preparations, the nature of the goods is a factor which is
required to be given greater importance. In the case of pharmaceutical
preparations, three  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on -
10/07/2019 01:30:20 ::: Nitin 27 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc important aspects
that are required to be taken into consideration are as follows:
> a. For deciding the question of deceptive similarity, the test is one of

> b. Stricter approach should be adopted while applying the test to judge the
> possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for another by a consumer;
c. Public interest would support lesser degree of proof in establishing
confusing similarity in the case of a trade mark in respect of medicinal
products as against other non-medicinal products.
35\. The Pianotist's case 15 which involved comparison of two word marks and
quoted by the Superme Court in Amritdhara (supra) has laid down the test of
deceptive similarity generally applicable to all the cases. The relevant
quotation is reproduced hereunder:
> "You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by
> their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied.
> You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy

> and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those
> trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the
> respective owners of the marks."
36\. Now, it is a well settled principle that while comparing the deceptive
similarity between the rival trade marks, the Court should consider their
overall similarity, including the similarity of the main idea and the
similarity of their broad and salient 15 1906 (23) RPC 774  ::: Uploaded on -

COMIP-32-2011-F.doc features, rather than doing a microscopic examination and
close scrutiny by placing the rival marks side by side and extracting their
dissimilarities. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s. Hiralal
Prabhudas v. Ganesh Trading Company & Ors. 16 has summarized the law relating
to deceptive similarity as under:
> "5. What emerges from these authorities is (a) what is the main idea or
> salient features, (b) marks are remembered by general impressions or by some
> significant detail rather than by a photographic recollection of the whole,
> (c) overall similarity is the touchstone, (d) marks must be looked at from

> similarity is sufficient. In addition indisputably must also be taken in-to
> consideration the nature of the commodity, the class of purchasers, the mode
> of purchase and other surrounding circumstances."
37\. Undisputedly, it is a practice in the field of medicinal and
pharmaceutical preparations to derive / coin trade marks from either of the
following:
a. the generic names of the components/molecule (Example - TELMA 16 AIR 1984
BOM 218  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20
::: Nitin 29 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc from TELMISARTAN);
b. the disease which the drugs are meant to cure (Example - PARKITANE from
PARKINSONS);
c. the body organ for which the drug is used (Example - Thyrox from Thyroid);
or d. the stream of science to which the drug belongs (Example - ONCO-BCG from
Oncology - the science of treating cancer).
38\. Even in the present case the Plaintiff, and possibly the Defendants have
derived their respective mark PANDERM / PANDERM+ and POLYDERM+ for their
dermatological product from the stream of science to which the product belongs
viz. DERMATOGLOGY. The marks involved in the present case are word marks.
There is no visual or structural similarity in the Plaintiff's registered
trade mark PANDERM and the Defendants' trade mark POLYDERM. Keeping aside the
descriptive suffix DERM which is indicative of a dermatological product, the
only similarity between the rival trade marks is the first letter in both
marks i.e. "P". It is neither the Plaintiff's case, nor would it be fair to
allow the Plaintiff to monopolize the suffix DERM in respect of pharmaceutical
preparations. In this respect it would be important to consider the practical
aspects to ascertain the possibility of confusion. As this Court has held
before in cases such as the present one where a part of the rival mark is
descriptive, greater regard must be paid to the uncommon element in the two
marks, which in this case are PAN and POLY. The Plaintiff's trade mark
consists of two  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019
01:30:20 ::: Nitin 30 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc syllables as against the
Defendants' trade mark which consists of three syllables. In my view, the
first syllables of the rival wordmarks PANDERM and POLYDERM are sufficiently
dissimilar to rule out any chance of confusion. I am of the opinion that an
average consumer is unlikely to be confused between the rival trade marks
since the pronunciation of the rival marks are easily distinguishable.
39\. To ascertain phonetic similarity between the rival trade marks, the
number of syllables in the rival trade marks, alongwith the aural and phonetic
effect from the pronunciation of the same must be considered. Where the rival
trade marks have different number of syllables, like in the present case,
their pronunciation is bound to be different. It is important to consider how
an average consumer in India would hear or pronounce the said trade marks. In
the present case, the Plaintiff's mark PANDERM has two syllables i.e. PAN +
DERM which in the Devangiri script are pronounced as पपन and डररम
respectively. Similarly, the Defendants' marks POLYDERM has three syllables
i.e. PO + LY + DERM which are pronounced as पप, लल and डररम respectively. In
view thereof, I do not see how a person with average intelligence and
imperfect recollection in India would be confused between the rival marks
which have such distinctive prefixes. In the absence of any likelihood of
confusion or deception, the Plaintiff's action for infringement or passing off
cannot lie.
40\. Whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another,
must nearly always depends on the first impression, as held in in the matter
of an  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019 01:30:20
::: Nitin 31 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc application by Rysta Ltd.17 As already
observed, earlier my first impression was and still remains that there is no
phonetic or visual similarity between the rival trade marks PANDERM and
POLYDERM+.
41\. It is also a settled principle of law that the prefix in a trade mark is
important and the first syllable is considered to be an important factor in
deciding the phonetic similarity between the two trade marks. In the matter of
trade mark application Herogen 18, while considering the deceptive similarity
between the two trade marks viz. Herogen and Cerogen, it was held that the two
trade marks are not similar because their first syllable were different. The
said principle is also reiterated by the Division Bench of this Court in
Johann A. Wulfing case (supra) , wherein while comparing the rival trade marks
CIPLAMINA and COMPLAMINA in respect of medicinal and pharmaceutical
preparations, this Court came to a conclusion that the two trade marks are not
similar. It was held that the first syllable of a word mark is generally the
most important as there is a tendency of person using the English language to
slur the termination of words. The first syllable generally plays an important
role in assisting the identification of the mark and creates a lasting
impression in the person's mind. Applying the said principle to the present
case, there is no doubt in my mind that the rival marks PANDERM and POLYDERM
with completely different prefixes and syllables can ever be termed as
deceptively similar.
42\. Further, even in the case of F. Hoffmann-la Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey
17 (1943) 60 RPC 87 at 108 18 1913 (Vol. 30) RPC page 73 at 76  ::: Uploaded

COMIP-32-2011-F.doc (supra) , while deciding a question of deceptive
similarity between marks DROPOVIT and PROTOVIT, the Supreme Court holding that
the suffix- "VIT" was descriptive, gave more emphasis on the uncommon elements
between the rival marks and it arrived at the conclusion that the same are not
deceptively similar. The Court held that the 'D' and 'P' in "DROPOVIT" and the
corresponding letters 'P' and 'T' in "PROTOVIT" cannot possibly be slurred
over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no
reasonable probability of confusion between the words, either from the visual
or the phonetic point of view. I believe the same principle is squarely
applicable to the present case.
43\. Even applying the principles laid down by M/s. Hiralal Prabhudas (supra)
to the present case, I am of the opinion that there is no overall similarity
between the rival marks. The idea conveyed by the rival marks PANDERM and
POLYDERM cannot be considered to be the same. The rival marks are
phonetically, structurally and visually dissimilar. I do not think that an
ordinary person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, who has
seen the Plaintiff's products bearing the trade mark PANDERM / PANDERM + on a
prior occasion, would be confused or deceived upon encountering the
Defendants' products bearing the mark POLYDERM or that such person would be
put into a state of wonderment. Bearing in mind the principles set out above,
while comparing the marks in the present matter i.e. PANDERM / PANDERM \+ and
POLYDERM +, I do not see a reasonable possibility of confusion between the
trade marks whether visually or phonetically. DERM being a descriptive term,

Nitin 33 / 37 COMIP-32-2011-F.doc Plaintiff cannot be permitted to claim
monopoly in its use merely because it is a prior user or adopter of the term.
The Plaintiff ought to have been cognizant of the fact while adopting a suffix
from a term such as DERMATOLOGY that other proprietors are also likely to
adopt and use similar marks in respect of their dermatological products.
44\. The essential and distinguishing features of the Plaintiff's and the
Defendants' marks are the prefixes "PAN" and "POLY". Had the case been that
the Defendant was using a similar sounding prefix such as "TAN", "DAN", "BAN"
etc. or other similar term, the case would have been different. However, the
structure of the rival marks and the phonetical dissimilarity does not permit
any likelihood of confusion or deception amongst the public. Compared as a
whole, the Defendants' trade mark is both visually and phonetically dissimilar
with the Plaintiff's mark.
45\. Relying upon the Supreme Court's decision in Cadila (supra) a Division
Bench of this Court in Bal Pharma Limited v. Wockhardt Limited & Anr. (supra)
has observed that where the chemical composition of two drugs is the same, the
question of causing any health problem or side effects really does not arise.
Admittedly, the compositions of the Plaintiff and the Defendants' products are
identical. Thus, there is no cause for concern with respect to public health.
46\. While there is no quarrel with the principles set out in the Judgments
cited on behalf of the Plaintiff, which principles I have applied to the
present case, it is a settled position in law that the authorities are binding
for the principle laid down and not for  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 :::

facts viz. whether in one case, the two marks were considered to be similar or
not. Each case is required to be decided on its own facts and it would be of
no use to note on how many points there was similarity and in how many others
there was absence of it. I, have however observed that one Judgment relied
upon by the Plaintiff in the case of Wockhardt v. Aristo (supra) has been set
aside by the Supreme Court vide its Order dated 24th November 1999 in Civil
Appeals Nos. 6739-6740 of 1999.
47\. The present case is filed on the basis of infringement and passing off of
the Plaintiff's wordmark PANDERM / PANDERM +. A perusal of the record endorses
the submission of Mr. Kamod that the Plaintiff has neither pleaded nor
claimed, let alone proved any proprietary rights in its packaging or carton or
trade dress. The relevant excerpts from the Plaint and the said Affidavits in
Lieu of Examination-in- Chief relied are reproduced below:
> A. Plaint "16. The Plaintiff states that by using the impugned trade mark
> "POLYDERM+", the Defendants have been and are infringing the registered
> trademarks of the Plaintiff and are also likely to further pass off or
> enable others to pass off their products as and for those of the Plaintiff
> or in some way connected with the Plaintiff.
> 17\. ... The Defendants by using the impugned, trade mark "POLYDERM+" are

> are passing off their medicinal preparations as that of the Plaintiff. ..."

It is not the Plaintiff's case that it has a unique and / or artistic
packaging / trade dress  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on -

has the exclusive proprietary rights. It is not the Plaintiff's case that the
Plaintiff has been using the said packaging / trade dress / carton openly,
continuously, exclusively or extensively, or that by virtue of such open and
continuous use, the Plaintiff has acquired goodwill and reputation in the said
packaging / trade dress/ carton. Though I find that the Plaintiff has alleged
that the Defendants have a similar packaging and / or trade dress, there is no
specific pleading that the Plaintiff has acquired any proprietary right in its
packaging or trade dress or carton in the first place. In short, the Plaintiff
has not come to the Court with the case that it has any proprietary or
statutory or common law right in its packaging or trade dress or carton and
therefore the question of comparing the Defendants' carton with that of the
Plaintiff's carton does not arise.
48\. In any event, before considering the features of the rival cartons, the
Court must satisfy itself that the rival word marks are visually similar, and
only when it is satisfied, the Court may go on to consider whether the added
matter upon the Defendant's carton out-weighs the impression created by the
visual similarity of the marks themselves. I have observed hereinbefore that
the rival word marks are not similar. There is no visual or phonetic
similarity between the word marks. Hence, the question of considering the
similarities between the rival cartons, as suggested by the Plaintiff, does
not arise. In any event, even if I was to consider both the cartons, I do not
feel that both are so similar so as to outweigh the impression of
dissimilarity created by the rival word marks and thereby create any confusion
or deception.  ::: Uploaded on - 06/07/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2019
