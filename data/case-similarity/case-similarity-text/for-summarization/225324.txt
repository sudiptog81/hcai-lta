Author: A Sikri
Bench: A Sikri
JUDGMENT A.K. Sikri, J.
1\. The plaintiff has come to this Court with the present suit for permanent
injunction, passing off, compensation and damages etc. [In the prayer clause,
though, no relief for compensation and damages is claimed]. To put in
nutshell, at the outset, the controversy is in respect of the film produced by
the defendant No. 1, M/s. RGV Film Factory, in which the defendant No. 2, M/s.
ADLABS also has stakes, with the proposed name 'Nishabd', which is slated for
release on 2.3.2007. The plaintiff is aggrieved by the adoption of title
'Nishabd' by the defendants No. 1 and 2 for their feature film. Defendant No.
3, M/s. Super Cassette Industries, is sold the rights in the music and lyrics
and for this reason the defendant No. 3 is also roped in, in this suit.
2\. The plaintiff claims its right over the said title on the ground that it
has already produced a movie with the title 'Nisshabd', which has also won
various awards and embracing of the same name by the defendants for their film
is nothing but an illegal and mala fide attempt to usurp the plaintiff's right
first place, that it would be a principle applicable in the case of registered
trade mark. Secondly and more important, is the distinction between the cases
of passing off action in goods/trading and passing off action in literary
works. In the former case one product is competing with the other and there
are two competitors. However, as far as literary work is concerned, as has
been pointed out above, it is a specific, separate and unique commercial item
and not as one product among many competing products. Each book, movie, play
or record is an economic market in and of itself, not in competition with
other similar literary works. Thus, in fact, this is the genesis for the
adoption of the test of secondary meaning for title of a literary work.
Therefore, it would be difficult to hold that delay is not fatal in such
cases.
38\. Consequently, I am, therefore, of the view that injunction of the nature
pressed by the plaintiff cannot be granted to the plaintiff at this stage when
it approached the Court barely 10 days before the proposed release of the
defendants' film with the same title. This injunction application is,
is nothing but an illegal and mala fide attempt to usurp the plaintiff's right
over the said title 'Nisshabd'.
3\. FACTUAL NARRATION The factual matrix narrated by the plaintiff, as per the
plaint, is that the plaintiff applied for and won the prestigious and highly
coveted 'FONDS SUD CINEMA' grant, awarded by the French Government for the
projection of its feature film 'Nisshabd', which was titled 'Nistadbd' at that
time. With this grant of 'FONDS SUD CINEMA' the plaintiff roped in M/s. Artcam
International, France, as co-producer of the feature film to satisfy one of
the conditions laid down in the grant for funding of the film and production
of this film commenced thereafter. It was re-christened as 'Nisshabd' as it
suited the numerological and astrological wishes of those involved in the
production of the movie and this name was also apt keeping in view the
storyline of the film, which was based on the lead character's obsession with
sound. Shooting of the movie began and completed within 40 days where after
through the Western India Film Producers Association (WIFPA) the plaintiff
applied for Central Board of Film Certification clearance on 8.6.2005. This
certification was given on 17.6.2005 and the film produced by the plaintiff,
thus, acquired the title 'Nisshabd'. Certification was for 'Unrestricted
Public Exhibition' popularly known as 'U' rating, namely, it was fit for
viewing by all audiences and age groups. The plaintiff further avers that
though with the said certification he was entitled to release the movie for
public viewing but it was not screened commercially due to paucity of funds.
However, it participated in various film festivals and won many awards,
details whereof are as under:
a) OSIAN's CINEFAN Festival of Asian Film (15-24 July 2005)
-Best Feature Film 
b) OSIAN's CINEFAN Festival of Asian Film (15-24 July 2005)
-Best Actress Award

f) Thrissur International Film Festival 2006
4\. It is further claimed THAT Mr. Jahar Kanungo and his wife Mrs. Lima
Kanungo, who are also the directors of the plaintiff company, invested all
their lives savings into the production of this movie. In addition, many well
wishers of Mr. Kanungo also pooled in money and contributed to ensure that his
dreams are realized in producing this movie. It is claimed that because of
various prestigious awards having been won by the plaintiff's movie, which is
also critically acclaimed internationally, the plaintiff's feature film under
the name and title 'Nisshabd' has come to be associated by the film
enthusiasts and members of the public exclusively with the plaintiff company
and its director Mr.Jahar Kanungo. This title 'Nisshabd' has, therefore,
acquired such distinctiveness that any use by any person or company of the
word 'Nisshabd' or any word deceptively similar thereto is bound to cause
confusion among the film enthusiasts and members of the public, who would get
the impression that the person/company using the word 'Nishabd' for its movie,
is the production of that of the plaintiff company herein. It is also alleged
that if both the films 'Nisshabd' and 'Nishabd' are screened together, it is
bound to create total confusion causing huge losses to the plaintiff herein,
more so when the theme of the two films are totally different. The word
'Nisshabd' which in literal translation in English signifies 'Wordless', the
movie of the plaintiff has artistically connected it to its foundational theme
- Silence. Silence occasioned by unspoken words, Silence occasioned by
wordlessness and Silence caused by the absence of sound. The whole story of
the film surrounds the story of a man who escapes the evil clutches of the
noisy city to go back to the village only to be let down by his obsession with
silence. He then returns to the city and compromises with its unforgiving
sounds. Hence the whole artistic theme and title in 'Nisshabd', produced by
the plaintiff, relates to the foundational artistic theme of the said feature
film and, therefore, the plaintiff company has enjoyed and continues to enjoy
full copyright in naming its film 'Nisshabd', as far as the theme relates to
any film produced. Therefore, the defendants cannot be allowed to give the
title 'Nishabd' to their film, which is phonetically similar to the word
'Nisshabd' with which name the plaintiff has produced the film. It is the case
of the plaintiff that since it has acquired prior rights in respect of the
name and title of this film 'Nisshabd' and there is certification by the CBFC
on 17.2.2005 as well, the defendants could not give the same title to their
film despite having knowledge of the pre-existing right of the plaintiff. It
is done by the defendants to exploit the rare accolades that the plaintiff's
film has received internationally.
5\. On the aforesaid averments, following prayer is made in the suit:
(a) to pass a decree of permanent injunction injuncting the Defendants, their
agents, employees etc. from using the brand name and title "NISHABD" which is
deceptively similar to the film of the Plaintiff herein, "NISSHABD";
(b) Restrain the Defendants by themselves, their servants, and/or agents by an
order of permanent injunction from in any manner using in relation to any of
its films the brand name and title "NISHABD", "NISSHABD" or any other
deceptively similar marks/name/words/abbreviated letters so as to pass off or
enable others to pass off the Defendant's film as that of the Plaintiff and/or
in some way connected with the Plaintiff.
(d) direct the Defendants to pay for costs of this Petition.
6\. Along with the suit, present IA is filed seeking ad interim injunction to
restrain the defendants from using the name and title 'NISHABD' for their film
and/or releasing the said movie and/or its sound track with the name
'Nishabd'. It is also prayed that the defendants be restrained from promoting
their film 'Nishabd' and its audio/video soundtrack and other advertisement in
audio/video/print media.
7\. Suit and this application came up for preliminary hearing on 21.2.2007.
Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 appeared on caveat and accepted notice and waived the
service of summons. Both the parties requested that matter be taken up on
urgent basis and injunction application be decided as the movie produced by
the defendants is scheduled to be released on 2.3.2007. It was accordingly
directed that the matter would be listed for hearing on 23.2.2007. Defendants
No. 1 and 2 have filed reply to the application opposing the prayer of
injunction. We shall traverse that reply while stating the arguments of the
parties and discussing those arguments.
8\. THE ARGUMENTS Learned Counsel for the plaintiff, with all zeal and
earnestness coupled with emotional pitch of his arguments, submitted that the
attempt on the part of the defendants in adopting the title 'Nishabd' for
their movie was utterly malicious. He pointed out that the plaintiff's film
had participated in 8th Mami's International Film Festival, Mumbai held
between 23-30 March 2006. This event was organized by ZEE Cinema in
association with M/s. ADLABS (the defendant No. 2). In this Film Festival the
plaintiff's movie was screened. The brochure, which was brought on the
occasion of the said Film Festival, gave the description of the plaintiff's
film wherein it was also mentioned that this film had won the Best Film Award
and Best Actress Award at OSIAN's Cinefan Festival of Asian Film. Thus, the
defendants came to know about the plaintiff's movie, even if it was not
commercially released, in March 2006. Within six days thereafter, the
defendants filed the application with WIFPA for production of their proposed
film with the name 'Nishabd', which was a rampant act of cheating and theft.
He further submitted that prior user of the title 'NISSABD' by the plaintiff
was not in dispute and there was no explanation forthcoming as to why the
defendants had decided to copy this title. He further submitted that same
title was bound to create confusion in the minds of public and for this
purpose he emphasized the averments, which have already been taken note of
above. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff also sought to explain the reason why
the plaintiff could not approach for such a relief earlier. He submitted that
the plaintiff is a person of ordinary means. Even the film which he produced
was financed by M/s. Artcam International, France, as co-producer as well as
contribution from his friends. It was because of the financial constraints
that the plaintiff could not even launch the film commercially, though the
film had been "released" by exhibiting the same in various film festivals. He
further submitted that keeping in view the provisions of the Cinematograph
(Certification) Rules, 1983 as amended, he bona fide believed that after CBFC
had given certification to its film it would not grant certification to the
defendants of the film with same name and title. However, when he came to know
in the month of January 2007 that CBFC had certified the defendants' film as
well with the same name, he approached the Court immediately thereafter. He
also submitted that before approaching the Court, the plaintiff, even to
protect its right, had applied to the Trade Mark Registry on 2.2.2007 to get
both 'Nisshabd' and 'Nishabd' registered as marks over which he has already
been enjoying rights as well as copyright. He also submitted that in any case,
certification by the CBFC is contrary to the Rules and, therefore, the
defendants cannot be allowed to take any mileage out of that.
9\. Learned Counsel for the defendants, on the other hand, countered the
aforesaid arguments and submissions made by him can be paraphrased as follows:
(a) The plaintiff had approached the Court much belatedly when the defendants'
film was completely shot and is already for release. He submitted that a sum
of Rs. 8 crores was spent on the production of this film by the defendants.
The defendants had also spent substantial amount on advertisement in promotion
of this film and there was a budget of Rs. 1.5 crores for this purpose and at
this juncture filing of the suit by the plaintiff was only a gimmick to get
publicity and in turn cause harm to the defendants.
(b) Not only there was delay simplicitor, such a delay was fatal as the
plaintiff did not approach this Court earlier even when as per his own
showing, he had come to know in May 2006 itself about the plans of the
defendants No. 1 and 2 to produce the film with title 'Nishabd'. However, for
all this period he maintained stoic silence tacitly allowing the defendants to
go ahead with their project spending huge amount. This, according to the
learned Counsel, amounts to waiver of the plaintiff's right, if any, by
acquiescence. He tried to demonstrate this by giving the following events:
3.4.2006-The defendant made an application to the Association of Motion
Pictures and TV Programme Producers for registration of the three titles
including 'Nishabd' for a Hindi feature film.
April 2006-It was announced in the media that the defendant is producing a
film by the name 'Nishabd' with Mr. Amitabh Bachachan, Ms. Jiah Khan and Ms.
Rewati.
May 2006-The defendant started shooting of the film and at one stretch the
entire movie was shot at a chosen location, i.e. Munnar in Kerala. The movie
has been produced at a total cost of approximately Rs. 8 crores.
17.7.2006-The Association of Motion Pictures granted a certificate to the
defendant for registering the feature film titled 'Nishabd' in Hindi.
18.7.2006-The Association of Motion Pictures, in the usual course as a
practice issued a circular, which was sent to all producer members. In that
circular at page 8 serial No. 28248 name of the defendant's movie 'Nishabd'
appeared.
July-December 2006-The post production work of the movie was done and during
this time there were several articles etc. in the media with regard to the
movie of the defendant.
December 2006-The defendant with an advertisement budget of Rs. 1.5 crores
started promotional work of the movie and a large part of it has already been
spent because the movie is due for release on 2.3.2007.
The website of the movie with the web link "www. nishabd the film. com" has
been launched.
January 2007-One song of the movie was shown on CNN IBN along with the name of
the movie 'Nishabd'.
M/s. Super Cassette Industries have the music rights of the film. From January
2007 they have started producing and distributing compact discs (CDs) and
cassettes in the market which are available at all music stores all over the
world and also from the internet.
Trailors of the defendant's movie have been running since December 2006 and
posters and publicity material of the film have already been distributed and
put up at Cinema Halls and other publicity places from January 2007.
There were articles in the press that the defendant's movie 'Nishabd' is being
released soon.
(c) He further submitted that because of delay, laches and acquiescence the
plaintiff should not be granted any interim injunction and in support he
relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramdev Food
Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel and Ors. and also the judgment
of Single Judge rendered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen in the case of
Biswaroop Roy Choudhary v. Karan Johar 2006 VIII AD (Delhi) 351.
(d) His additional submission was that even otherwise, the plaintiff has no
case on merits. His argument was that admittedly the case set up by the
plaintiff was of passing off and not of infringement of any registered trade
mark, but there could not have been any confusion between the two films
inasmuch as:
(i) the concept of the two films was entirely different. As against the
plaintiff's film where the emphasis was 'Nisshabd' - Reaching Silence with the
theme where his hero has obsession with silence, the subject of the film
produced by the defendants centered around the storyline portraying the
relationship between a 60 years old with an 18 years old girl, who also
happens to be his daughter's friend. 'Nishabd' was the only title which could
aptly describe such a theme with unusual relationship between the two which
often leave the listens or views unspeakable (Nishabd), i.e. when they find it
hard to speak about this relationship. The tag line is that some love stories
are never meant to be understood or spoken
(ii) The plaintiff's film was a documentary whereas the defendants' film was a
feature film with commercial overturns.
(iii) The plaintiff's film was in Bengali and the CBFC certification was also
to this effect whereas the defendants' film was in Hindi. The plaintiff's film
therefore, had limited audience who could speak and understand Bengali, which
would rule out confusion.
(iv) The plaintiff's film was not commercially released and, therefore, the
movie watchers would not even know the existence of the plaintiff's film and
thus, there could not be any confusion, namely, it could not be said that the
defendants' film would be taken as that of the plaintiff. Such a confusion was
ruled out in all probabilities, as the sale promotions of the defendant's film
were with central characters, namely, Amitabh Bachachan and Jiah Khan.
(e) His last submission was that in case injunction is granted, the defendants
would suffer irreparable injury, which could not be compensated in terms of
money in the event the defendants succeed ultimately. On the other hand, if
the injunction is refused, the plaintiff could always be compensated by way of
damages if the plaintiff succeeds in the end.
LAW ON THE SUBJECT:
10\. The case relates to the alleged appropriation of a title. It is not a
case where there is any allegation of usurpation of the work of the plaintiff
by the defendants. In fact, as seen above, the plot and storyline of the two
films is altogether different and there is not even a semblance of similarity
between the two.
11\. It is common, rather imperative, to give title to literary or
entertainment works. Like human beings, literary work produced by the author
or the work of entertainment produced by a producer needs a name. It is only
then such work would be identified. The term 'literary title' is used to
encompass titles of books, periodicals, newspapers, plays, motion pictures,
television series, sings, phonograph records, cartoon features and the like
[McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Third Edition (1995) Vol. I].
12\. American Courts have taken uniform view that title alone of a literary
work cannot be protected by Copyright Law. Copying of a title alone, and not
the plot, characterization, dialogue, song etc. is not the subject of
Copyright Law. Thus, a copyright on a literary work would not include
exclusive right to use the title on any other work. What, therefore, follows
is that if a junior user uses the senior user's literary title as the title of
a work that by itself does not infringe the copyright of a senior user's work
since there is no copyright infringement merely from the identity or
similarity of the titles alone. Same is the position under Copyright Law in
India.
13\. However, legal protection for literary titles lies in the field of
trademark and unfair competition. In general, such titles are protected
according to the fundamental tenets of trademark and unfair competition law.
McCarthy has described this and even provided the test which has to be applied
while determining the infringement in the realm of trademark as under:
In general, such titles are protected according to fundamental tenets of
trademark and unfair competition law. That is, such titles cannot be used by a
junior user in such a way as to create a likelihood of confusion of source,
affiliation, sponsorship or connection in the minds of potential buyers. For
these purposes, titles of literary and entertainment creations and works are
treated in much the same way as the trademarks of other commercial
commodities.
14\. Titles may relate to two types of works, i.e. titles of single literary
works and titles of series of literary works. Titles of series of books,
periodicals or newspapers do function as a trademark to indicate that each
edition comes from the same source as the others and, therefore, such titles
are even registrable as trademark. Such 'series titles' enjoy the same
protection as usual trademark. The title of a newspaper serves a trademark
function to the reader who is shopping among competing newspapers, just as
when he or she is shopping among competing household products. Or, for
example, where a term has been used in the title of a series of books, it may
come to identify and distinguish a source to buyers. If so, it is a trademark
for a series of books and is registrable as such. This trend is picked up even
in television plays and motion pictures. We have television serials which run
into hundreds of episodes. We have the examples of particular motion pictures
made in series. The trend which started in Hollywood with 'The Godfather',
'Rocky', 'Die Hard', 'Mission Impossible', 'The Matrix', 'Jurrasic Park' etc.
has percolated in Indian film industry as well with the movies 'Hera Pheri -
Phir Hera Pheri, 'Dhoom - Dhoom II and 'Munna Bhai MBBS - Lage Raho Munna
Bhai'. It is easy to give trademark protection to such titles of series of
literary work etc.
15\. That is not to say that titles of single literary work do not enjoy
trademark protection, but in order to become entitled to this protection, it
is necessary to prove that such a title has acquired secondary meaning. To
quote McCarthy one again:
The law of literary titles is unique in one important respect. That is, the
courts have given trademark protection to literary titles of one-shot, single
works only upon a showing of secondary meaning, even though the title is not
descriptive of the contents of the work. Regardless of the arbitrary or
fanciful nature of the title as compared with the contents of the single book,
play, movie, record, etc., secondary meaning is required. Thus, unlike
ordinary marks, literary titles of single works which are inherently
distinctive are not accorded immediate protection, absent proof of secondary
meaning and consumer recognition.
16\. Underlying assumption behind this rule is that only if such title has
acquired the secondary meaning and is capable of associating itself with the
particular work or source, the question of likelihood of confusion of source,
affiliation, sponsorship or connection in the minds of potential buyers/users
would arise. This aspect shall be considered in some detail later in the
discussion.
17\. Title of a literary work may be descriptive of the literary work itself
or the title may be such which has no relationship with the nature of work to
which it is attached.
18\. Whether titles of single literary works can be registered as trade mark
or not has itself become debatable in the US, though in the case of titles of
series of literary work, judicial opinion is that they are registrable.
However, it is not necessary to go into this debate inasmuch as the
plaintiff's title 'Nisshabd' for its film is not registered as a trademark.
The case at hand is, therefore, while applying the legal protection given to
such titles under the Trade Marks Act is to be considered on the principle
applicable in the cases of passing off of such trademarks. In passing off,
necessary ingredient to be established is the likelihood of confusion and for
establishing this ingredient it becomes necessary to prove that the title has
acquired secondary meaning. Thus, in case of unregistered title following
ingredients are to be proved in order to triumph in an injunction suit:
i) Title has acquired the secondary meaning;
ii) There is likelihood of confusion of source, affiliation, sponsorship or
connection of potential buyers/audience/viewers.
19\. The test of secondary meaning in respect of literary titles is explained
in the following manner by McCarthy (supra):
The test of secondary meaning for literary titles is essentially one of
determining whether, in the minds of a significant number of people, the title
in question is associated with a single source of the literary work. That is,
are people likely to assume that defendant's work is connected in some way
with the producers of plaintiff's literary effort? The association need be
only with a single, anonymous source. That is, the consumer need not know the
trade name of the source, but is entitled to assume that all works or goods
under that title are controlled by some single source.
20\. In International Film Service Co. Ltd. v. Associated Producers Inc. 273
F. 585 (D.C.N.Y. 1921), the Judge Learned Hand observed as under:
A title is, if not strictly descriptive, at least suggestive and not an
arbitrary sign... [t]he question is said to be of secondary meaning, following
the long line of decisions in the Webster Dictionary cases. The plaintiff
succeeds as soon as he shows an audience educated to understand that the title
means his play...the title is the proper name of a specific thing, not the
differential of a species, as in the case of fungibles.
21\. Each literary work is a specific, separate and unique commercial item and
not as one product among many competing products. The reason is simple. Each
book, movie, play or record is an economic market in and of itself, not in
competition with other similar literary works. Therefore, each literary title
is regarded as a term used to describe the product itself, rather than a mark
used to designate a single source among many sources of literary works.
22\. What is the evidence needed to establish secondary meaning for a literary
work? In International Film Service Co. Ltd. v. Associated Producers Inc.
(supra) following simple, but at the same time most eloquent parameter is laid
down by the Court:
The plaintiff succeeds as soon as he shows as audience educated to understand
that the title means his play.
23\. Even if the work has not been released, a sufficient amount of pre-
release publicity of the title may cause a title to acquire recognition
sufficient for protection. Relevant evidence from which secondary meaning for
a literary title may be inferred as a question of fact include: (1) the length
and continuity of use; (2) the extent of advertising and promotion and the
amount of money spent; (3) the sales figures on purchases or admissions and
the number of people who bought or viewed plaintiff's work; and (4) the
closeness of the geographical and product markets of plaintiff and defendant.
24\. In so far as test of likelihood of confusion of literary titles is
concerned, it is the same as applied to trade marks in general. In considering
the likelihood of confusion similar literary titles, the Courts often takes
into consideration the total visual impression of the whole item reaching
consumers. It is held by Courts that little assistance can be taken from a
meticulous comparison to words letter by letter, syllable by syllable
pronounced with clarity to be expected from a teacher of elocution. The two
marks are to be compared in totality and stress is to be laid on common
features rather than on distinctive features.
25\. Therefore, what follows is that while considering the application for
temporary injunction and pendente lite relief, the plaintiff has the burden of
proving probable existence of secondary meaning in the title leading to
likelihood of confusion and a likelihood of success at trial. Where the
plaintiff cannot make a strong case of secondary meaning or likelihood of
confusion, a preliminary injunction has to be denied. However, in a case where
plaintiff introduces sufficient evidence on secondary meaning and likelihood
of confusion, defendant's use of literary title need to be preliminarily
enjoined. Where a dramatic work alleged to be infringement is about to be
widely disseminated among the public, the need for preliminary injunctive
relief may be great. In Chappell & Co. v. Fields 210 F. 864 (2nd Cir. 1914) as
far back as in 1914 the US Court had observed that "preliminary injunctions
are granted more readily in dramatic than in other cases because the delay
involved in waiting a final decree would generally amount to a denial of
justice."
26\. I may state here that in discussing the aforesaid legal position I have
extensively quoted the legal position in US as applicable to the cases of
"titles in literary or entertain works." Reason is simple. Law in India on the
subject is not much developed and the only case cited at the bar was the
judgment of a learned Single Judge (per Hon'ble Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen) of
this Court in the case of Biswaroop Roy Choudhary v. Karan Johar (supra).
However, it may be added that the principles on which law in US on the subject
has developed are the same as applicable in the Indian law of passing off. The
only difference is that where as there is a paucity of case law in India, in
America, over a period of time law has sufficiently been evolved.
THE CASE AT HAND:
27\. We may apply the afore-stated principle of law to the case at hand. It is
not in dispute that the plaintiff is the prior user who produced the film way
back in the year 2005 with the title 'Nisshabd'. It is also not in dispute
that this film has not been commercially exploited. At the same time,
indubitably, it has been shown in various Film Festivals and in many such
events it has won prizes, some of which are treated as prestigious and highly
coveted. The question is whether on this basis it can be said that the title
of the plaintiff's film has acquired secondary meaning, i.e. whether the
audience would associate the title 'Nisshabd' to mean that it refers to the
plaintiff's movie. Another question is as to whether there is likelihood of
confusion in the mind of public, namely, with the defendants' movie 'Nishabd'
people would perceive that it is the same movie which the plaintiff produced.
Third question is what would be the effect of delay in bringing the cause to
the Court? I have posed all those three questions together because of the
reason that answer to the same has become inextricable, specially in view of
the facts of this case.
28\. There is a candid admission in the plaint itself that the plaintiff had
come to know about the defendants' intention to choose the title 'Nishabd' for
its forthcoming venture. During the course of arguments, learned Counsel for
the plaintiff has produced the copy of an e-mail sent by the director of the
plaintiff company (who is the director of the film as well) to WIFPA. This
letter contains complaint against the defendant No. 1 regarding its proposed
film to be named as 'Nishabd' and states that since he has already produced
the film with the same title, no other film with this title could be
registered. I reproduce below the said letter verbatim:
Dear Mr. Prabhat Pande, We find in the newspapers report of a feature film to
be made by Mr. Ramgopal Varma, and the proposed film will be named as NISHABD.
As you may be aware, our film titled NISSHABD (in Bengali) has already been
registered (Registration No. 8238 vide your letter No. WIFPA/6-05/516 dated
8th June 05. The film has already been made and got its censor certificate
from Delhi. The film has already been shown at about 11 International
festivals so far, no other film with the same title NISHABD or NISSHABD can be
registered.

29\. On the same date reply was received by the plaintiff from WIFPA taking
the stand that there was no impediment in registering the title 'Nisshabd' for
Hindi film as the plaintiff's title 'Nisshabd' was for Bengali film. The text
of this letter is manifestation of the defendants' intention and the view of
WIFPA:
From: sangram shirke Date: Mon, 8 May 2006 11:16:34+0100 (BST) Subject: Title
Nisshabd To:
jaharkanungo@gmail.com Dear Sir, In reference to your email dated 8th May 2006
please note you have registered the Title "Nisshabd" for Bengali Film,
therefore, the said title is free for registration for other languages, T.V.
serial or Music Album.
Mr. Ramgopal Varma has registered the title "Nisshabd" for Hindi and as the
rules of Title Registration the said title is free for registration for other
languages.
Also kindly note the titles have to be renewed every year if required by
paying the requisite fees.
Kindly take note of the same.
Thanking you, Prabhat Pandey Hony. Gen. Secretary Western India Film
Producers' Association
30\. At this stage, we are not concerned as to whether the position taken by
WIFPA was legally valid or not. What is stressed is that on 8.5.2006 the
plaintiff was made aware that the title 'Nisshabd' was free for registration
in languages other than Bengali and even for TV serial or music album and as
the defendants' proposed film was in Hindi language, it could be registered
with WIFPA. Notwithstanding the same, the plaintiff remained silent and did
not take an action. He eschewed and gave in. The reason given by the plaintiff
that because of financial difficulties he could not file the case earlier,
would not be convincing and this plea does not inspire confidence. In any
case, fact remains that the plaintiff did not even lodge a protest with WIFP,
the defendants or any other authority, including CBFC. At least the plaintiff
cannot argue that so called financial difficulties prevented him from writing
a protest letter even.
31\. Such a silence on the part of the plaintiff may amount to giving up
rights, if any, he had. What is more important is that consciously he allowed
the defendants to go ahead with the production of the movie 'Nishabd'. Since
the storyline of the defendants' movie is totally different, even if it was
being shot with the said story, it was not of any concern to the plaintiff.
However, what would be of relevance to us is the actions and steps taken by
the defendants in the adoption of the title 'Nishabd' for their movie. In
April 2006, the defendants had announced that they were producing the film by
the name 'Nishabd." In July 2006, the Association of Motion Pictures granted a
certificate to the defendants for registering the feature film with this title
in India. On 18.7.2006 the said Association had even issued a circular, which
was sent to all producer members. Various articles in the media appeared
regarding this movie. The producer and the director wanted to project the bold
theme, which this movie had and the articles focused this theme of the movie.
After the completion of the movie and before its release, as it has become a
necessary marketing strategy, the defendants also started promotional work of
the movie. It is stated that a sum of Rs. 1.5 crores is the advertisement
budget for this movie and large part of it has already been spent. The
defendants even launched website of this movie. Music rights have already been
sold to the defendant No. 3. They have started producing and distributing
compact dics and cassettes in the market, which are available at all music
stores all over the world and also from the internet. Since December 2006,
trailors of the defendants' movie have been running in various cinema halls.
Posters and publicity material of the film have also been distributed. The
lead cast in the movie is Amitabh Bachchan and Jiah Khan. Amitabh Bachchan is
indubitably an established and accomplished actor of prominence, who many
perceive to be a living legend. What is emphasised by the defendants is the
impact of publicity of the defendants' film with title 'Nishabd' by keeping
him in the forefront of such promos. Jiah Khan is a debutant and the producers
have tried to launch her as a new face aptly suited for such a role. With this
kind of promotion given by the defendants to their forthcoming film, it is
claimed that general public today associate title 'Nishabd' more with the
defendants' film and not the plaintiff's.
32\. When the matter is examined in the aforesaid backdrop, the plaintiff has
lost the chance in getting temporary injunction by not approaching the Court
earlier. By his inaction and allowing the things to happen in the aforesaid
manner, it has slipped an opportunity. Things would have been different had we
considered this case when the film was being shot by the defendants or even
completed but before the promotional work of the film started by the
producers. The plaintiff could have argued that he is the senior user of the
title and it is his film alone which has not only been produced much earlier
but has been shown in various Film Festivals and has won awards and,
therefore, has acquired secondary meaning, namely, title 'Nishabd' is
associated with his film. I consider that favorable critical reaction to the
work may be treated as evidence of secondary meaning for the title, as a
highly praised work is more likely to be known to the public by name. In fact,
"any publicity is good publicity" and, therefore, it is not necessary that to
acquire secondary meaning, work has to be popular, for even bad reviews and
advertisements, public comments may bring about widespread identification of
the literary work by its title. May be, consideration of the plaintiff's claim
say even in July/August 2006 could have yielded positive results for it. In
presenti, because of the publicity of extravagant nature of the defendants'
film in the form of articles published in the journals and newspapers,
posters, website, release of film's music, the forthcoming film of the
defendants is known more than that of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff has
allowed it to happen. It is because of this that the plaintiff even cannot
claim that the title 'Nishabd' is associated only with its movie or the public
does not know about the defendants' movie.
33\. Prima facie, as of today the claim of the plaintiff's movie's title
'Nisshabd' appears to be blurred in comparison with the defendants' movie's
title 'Nishabd'. For the same reason, as the defendants' forthcoming movie has
acquired much publicity, there is hardly any question of confusion. One
cannot, in the process, lose sight of the fact that the plaintiff's film is a
documentary and in Bengali language whose viewership would be substantially
less than a Hindi movie. Further, no doubt, the plaintiff's movie has achieved
critical acclaim but only in the Film Festivals where not only the viewership
is limited but of a particular category. Therefore, in today's context in so
far as the question of granting temporary injunction is concerned, the
plaintiff has not been able to meet the above requirements.
34\. In International Film Service Co. Ltd. v. Associated Producers Inc.
(supra) it was held that "The plaintiff succeeds as soon as he shows an
audience educated to understand that the title means his play". I am conscious
of the argument of the learned Counsel for the plaintiff that only because the
plaintiff is a small time producer and, therefore, could not commercially
release the film earlier, though he intends to do it now, title of his film
should not be hijacked by those who consider themselves mighty and have reach
in the film industry. There is a lot of substance in this argument. However,
it is stated at the cost of repetition that such an argument would have been
worth its weight had the plaintiff approached the Court earlier and taken
action to nip in the bud the attempt of the defendants in choosing this title
for their film. In fact, knowing his limitations viz. if he allows the
defendants to publicise their film with title 'Nishabd' he would lose out,
should have made him more vigilant in promptly approaching the Court. By delay
it has has allowed the damage to be caused to itself inasmuch as, today
overwhelming section of public associate this title with the defendants' film.
35\. In this context, it would be apt to quote from the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai
Rambhai Patel and Ors. (supra) where it is held as under:
103\. Acquiescence is a facet of delay. The principle of acquiescence would
apply where: (i) sitting by or allowing another to invade the rights and
spending money on it; (ii) it is a course of conduct inconsistent with the
claim for exclusive rights for trade mark, trade name, etc.
36\. Because of delay, this Court in Biswaroop Roy Choudhary v. Karan Johar
(supra) also refused to grant injunction observing as under:
12\. Delay in approaching the Court, so far as grant of equitable relief is
concerned, is always fatal. If the plaintiff is a serious producer of the film
he ought not to have ignored gossip within his trade, whether it was in the
form of press reports or exchange of communication to the Guild or Association
claiming the same title. At this present moment I am unable to find any
plausible reason for not filing the present case at lease upon the Defendants
performing its Mahoorat. The plaintiff has waited for the Defendants to expend
large sums of money and energy in the completion of the film with the same
title, thereby shifting the balance of convenience in favor of the Defendant.
The situation that is arrived at is that the likelihood of passing off is
almost wholly eradicated. The subsisting claim may, at the highest, be the use
of a title which the Plaintiff has itself failed to use. The right as well as
the loss can only be determined after the trial.
37\. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff had referred to the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. and Anr. v.
Sudhir Bhatia and Ors. and of this Court in Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Vipin Gupta
2006 (7) AD (Delhi) 688 to contend that injunction could not be refused only
on the ground of delay and laches. It has to be borne in mind mind, in the
first place, that it would be a principle applicable in the case of registered
trade mark. Secondly and more important, is the distinction between the cases
of passing off action in goods/trading and passing off action in literary
works. In the former case one product is competing with the other and there
are two competitors. However, as far as literary work is concerned, as has
been pointed out above, it is a specific, separate and unique commercial item
and not as one product among many competing products. Each book, movie, play
or record is an economic market in and of itself, not in competition with
other similar literary works. Thus, in fact, this is the genesis for the
adoption of the test of secondary meaning for title of a literary work.
Therefore, it would be difficult to hold that delay is not fatal in such
cases.
38\. Consequently, I am, therefore, of the view that injunction of the nature
pressed by the plaintiff cannot be granted to the plaintiff at this stage when
it approached the Court barely 10 days before the proposed release of the
defendants' film with the same title. This injunction application is,
therefore, dismissed. It is made clear that entire discussion in the order is
on the prima facie view of the matter and observations made in this order are
only tentative.
No costs.

over the said title 'Nisshabd'.
3\. FACTUAL NARRATION The factual matrix narrated by the plaintiff, as per the
plaint, is that the plaintiff applied for and won the prestigious and highly
coveted 'FONDS SUD CINEMA' grant, awarded by the French Government for the
projection of its feature film 'Nisshabd', which was titled 'Nistadbd' at that
time. With this grant of 'FONDS SUD CINEMA' the plaintiff roped in M/s. Artcam
International, France, as co-producer of the feature film to satisfy one of
the conditions laid down in the grant for funding of the film and production
of this film commenced thereafter. It was re-christened as 'Nisshabd' as it
suited the numerological and astrological wishes of those involved in the
production of the movie and this name was also apt keeping in view the
storyline of the film, which was based on the lead character's obsession with
sound. Shooting of the movie began and completed within 40 days where after
through the Western India Film Producers Association (WIFPA) the plaintiff
applied for Central Board of Film Certification clearance on 8.6.2005. This
certification was given on 17.6.2005 and the film produced by the plaintiff,
thus, acquired the title 'Nisshabd'. Certification was for 'Unrestricted
Public Exhibition' popularly known as 'U' rating, namely, it was fit for
viewing by all audiences and age groups. The plaintiff further avers that
