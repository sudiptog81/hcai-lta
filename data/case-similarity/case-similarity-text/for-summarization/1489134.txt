1-1-1977)]. COMMENTS
(i) An instrument of gift of immovable property requires registration under
this Act, whatever be the value of the property; Charan v. Sucha, (1921) 4 Lah
LJ 7.
(ii) The words 'create', 'limit' or 'extinguish' and 'right', 'title' or
'interest' imply a definite change of legal relation to the property by an
expression of will embodied in the document. The word 'declare' is ejusdem
genesis with the words 'create', 'assign' or 'limit'. It implies a declaration
of will, not a mere statement of a fact; Sakharan v. Madan, (1881) 5 Bom 232
approved by Privy Council in Bageshwari Charan v. Jagarnath Kuari, (1931) 59
IA 130, wherein it stated: "The distinction is between a mere recital of a
fact and something which in itself creates a title." When it is necessary to
determine whether an instrument other than a deed of gift purports or operates
to create an interest of the value of Rs. 100 or upwards in immovable property
within the meaning of section 17(1)(b) the test of value is the consideration
stated in the instrument; Nana v. Anant, (1877) 2 Bom 353. A deposit of title
deeds with the creditor by the debtor with the intent to create a security
implies in law a contract between the parties to create a mortgage and no
registered instrument is required under section 59 of the Transfer of Property
Act as in other case of mortgage. But if the parties choose to reduce the
contract to writing, this implication of law is excluded by their express
bargain and the document will be the sole evidence of its terms. In such a
case the deposit and the document both form integral parts of the transaction
and are essential in the creation of the mortgage. In such a case the document
which constitutes the bargain regarding security requires registration under
section 17 of the Act as a non-testamentary instrument creating interest in
immovable property where the value is Rs. 100 or upwards; United Bank of India
Ltd. v. Lakhram Sonaram & Co., AIR 1965 SC 1591. An instrument of partition of
immovable property requires registration as it declares an interest in
immovable property provided, however, the value of the interest so declared is
Rs. 100 or upwards; Siromoni v. Hemkumar, AIR 1968 SC 1299. But a writing
which merely states that there has in time past been a partition is not a
declaration of will but a mere statement of fact and it does not require
registration; Venkataraju v. Yudhkondalu, AIR 1958 AP 147.
(iii) The term 'consideration' used in this clause is a technical term. It
implies that the person to whom the money is paid himself declares, limits or
extinguishes his interest in immovable property in consideration of such
payment; Shidlingapa v. Chenbasapa, (1819) 4 Bom 235. A lease for one year
containing an option to the tenant to revenue for a further period of one year
or any other term is not a lease for a term exceeding one year and does not
requires registration under this clause; Boyd v. Kreig, (1890) 17 Cal 548
dissenting from; Bhobani v. Shibnath, (1886) 13 Cal 113. A lease for the life
of the lessee is a lease for a term exceeding one year as it entitles the
lessee to hold for more than one year if he lives so long. It is not a lease
terminable at the end of a year or at the option of the lessor. It therefore
requires registration; Parstrotam v. Nana, (1893) 18 Bom 109.
(iv) Sub-section 2(i) of section 17 merely provided that nothing in sub-
section 1(b) applied to a composition deed, but that did not mean that if a
document required registration under another enactment, it was valid without
registration; Govind Ram v. Madan Gopal, (1944) 721.A 76: AIR 1945 PC 74.
(v) A consent decree purporting to create a gift requires registration under
section 17(1)(a) and is not exempt from registration under section 17(2)(vi);
Kauleshwari v. Surajnath Rai, AIR 1957 Pat 456.
(vi) The only test under the present clause is whether the receipt purports to
extinguish the mortgage. If it does, it requires registration, but not
otherwise. A receipt for payment of money under a mortgage (other than an
endorsement on a mortgage-deed) issued by a mortgage mentioning not only the
payment of the full mortgage amount but also the extinction of mortgage
requires registration; Gurdial Singh v. Kartar Singh, AIR 1964 Punj 141. A
deed of adoption as distinguished from an authority to adopt does not require
registration; Vishwanth Ramji v. Rahibai, AIR 1931 Bom 105: 128 IC 901.
18. Documents of which registration is optional.—Any of the following documents may be registered under this Act, namely:—
(a) instruments (other than instruments of gift and wills) which purport or
operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or
in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of a
value less then one hundred rupees, to or in immovable property;
(b) instruments acknowledging the receipt or payment of any consideration on
account of the creation, declaration, assignment, limitation or extinction of
any such right, title or interest;
(c) leases of immovable property for any term not exceeding one year, and
leases exempted under section 17;
33 [(cc) instruments transferring or assigning any decree or order of a Court
or any award when such decree or order or award purports or operates to
create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future,
any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of a value less
than one hundred rupees, to or in immovable property;]
(d) instruments (other than wills) which purport or operate to create,
declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest to or in
movable property;
(e) wills; and
(f) all other documents not required by section 17 to be registered. State

where Act No. 16 of 1864 or the Indian Registration Act, 1866 (20 of 1866),
was in force in the place and at the time in and at which such unregistered
document was executed, “unregistered” means not registered according to such

not registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1871 (8 of 1971), or the
Indian Registration Act, 1877 (3 of 1977), or this Act. State Amendments
Andhra Pradesh: In section 50, in sub-section (1), for the expression “clauses

1976”. [Vide Uttar Pradesh Act 19 of 1981, sec. 9 (w.r.e.f. 1-8-1981)].
comments Section 50 of the Registration Act, has to be read in the light of
section 17 of the same Act and Section 91 of the Evidence Act. If this is done
the word “affect” will be seen to be a compendious term for expressing the
longer phrase “purporting or operating to create, declare, assign, limit or
extinguish whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest
whether vested or contingent”; Saraswathamma v. Paddavva, AIR 1923 Mad 297.
