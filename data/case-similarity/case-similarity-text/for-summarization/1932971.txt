    O R D E R
The Original Application is filed for interim injunction restraining the
respondent and her men from in any manner copying, recording, publishing,
copy right in any work shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by
the assignor or his duly authorised agent."
7\. He also draws attention of this Court by citing a decision of the Delhi
High Court in 2008 (37) PTC 587 (Del) [Phonographic Performance Ltd., v. Hotel
Gold Regency & Others] in which it is observed on the provisions of Copy Right
Act, 1957 that the parties can only agree to do what the law permits they to
do and if they agree on something which is not permissible under law, such an
agreement to that extent would not be enforceable.
8\. In view of the provisions under Sections 18 and 19 of the Copy Right Act
1957 the assignment of copy right can only made by writing and if it is made
other than writing, it is not at all enforceable in law. When the statutory
requirement is not fulfilled, the agreement whether orally by any other means
is not sustainable.
9\. In order to obtain temporary injunction, the applicants have to show prima
facie case and the balance of convenience. But in view of the above said
observation, this Court is unable to find any prima facie case nor balance of
respondent and her men from in any manner copying, recording, publishing,
marketing, editing or doing any other act so as to infringe the copy right of
the applicants in the works detailed in the schedule.
2\. The respondent has filed suit for declaration of her title as owner of
copyright in the works of her husband late Pulavar Keeran (by virtue of
inheritance) and consequent injunction restraining from the applicants and
their men illegally exploiting the works of late Keeran. The suit is in part-
heard stage. The applicants/defendants have filed this application under Order
XIV Rule 8 of Original Side Rules read with Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of
C.P.C., for a temporary injunction.
3\. In the affidavit it is alleged that the suit has been instituted by the
plaintiff nearly 14 years after the death of her husband. Pulavar Keeran died
in November 1990. These applicants have purchased the exclusive right to the
works of Pulavar Keeran outright and he did not retain any right over his
literary work even during his lifetime. The applicants were informed on the
evening of 3.2.2011 that the respondent had entered into some deal with a
third party and has proposed to publish MP3 version of her husband's work on
6.2.2011, in which the applicants alone have the exclusive right. In the midst
of trial the plaintiff cannot usurp law into her hands and defeat the rights
of the applicants by publishing the works of her husband on her own or through
anybody. Hence, temporary injunction is prayed for.
4\. In the counter, the allegations in the affidavit are controverted. The
applicants are claiming that they had orally purchased the copy right from
Late Keeran. He did not assign copy rights to the applicants. The arrangements
with the applicant/first defendant was only to make copies to determine the
commercial viability and market for the work of late Keeran. At no point of
time, he did sell or assign or part with the copy right. The copy right cannot
be assigned orally. It can be only in the written form. On 6.2.2011, this
respondent decided to release a new developed version of the 'Kamba Ramayanam
Kalangiyam' and other spiritual works of Late Keeran by way of DVD. This
application is unsustainable in law and on facts. The balance of convenience
is in favour of the respondent. Hence the application may be dismissed.
5\. It is the contention of the applicants that the first respondent has
approached the Late Pulavar Keeran for the purpose of recording and selling
audio cassettes of religious discourses and lectures of Late Pulavar Keeran
and he demanded an outright payment of Rs.2,500/- for every discourse to be
recorded in a single cassette for which the first respondent agreed for the
same. This allegation is available in the written statement and in the reply
notice issued by the first defendant which is marked as Ex.P.2. The written
statement further goes to say that the above said was the manner and method in
which the business transactions between the Late Keeran and the defendants
were conducted. Hence it is patent that the copy right was not transferred to
the applicants by means of any written assignment. The above said allegations
in the reply notice and written statement do not indicate the date on which
both Late Keeran and first defendant entered into the agreement.
6\. The learned counsel for the respondent Mr.Sivam Sivanandaraj would contend
that the assignment or transfer of a copyright can only be in writing which is
a statutory mandate and that in the absence of any written conveyance of
transfer, the claim could not stand. In support of his contention, he placed
reliance upon a Division Bench decision of Karnataka High Court in AIR 1992
Kant 1 [K.A.Venugopala Setty v. Dr.Suryakantha U. Kamath] in which the learned
Judges have extracted section 18 and 19 of the Copy Right Act, 1957, and
explained the import of provisions also. The extraction of the relevant
provisions and operative portion of the decision are as follows:
"8. ... ... ... ... ... ... Section 18 of the Act provides for "Assignment of
copyright". It reads thus :
"18(1) : The owner of the copyright in an existing work or the prospective
owner of the copyright in a future work may assign to any person the copyright
either wholly or partially and either generally or subject to limitations and
either for the whole term of the copyright or any part thereof.
Provided that in the case of the assignment in any future work, the assignment
shall take effect only when the work comes into existence."
Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 18 are not relevant for our purpose.
Therefore, it is open to the owner of the copyright who is normally the author
of the work to assign it to any person in respect of his existing work, as
well as of the future work. In this case, we are concerned with the copyright
of the existing work because the work has been printed. It was only at the
stage of publication of the book, the printer-defendant came forward with a
plea that the plaintiff-author of the book had assigned the copyright orally.
Section 19 of the Act provides for the "Mode of assignment". It reads thus :
"19(1) No assignment of the copy right in any work shall be valid unless it is
in writing signed by the assignor or by his duly authorised agent.
2) The assignment of the copyright in any work shall, among other thing
indicate clearly the right proposed to be assigned and the size of the work."
9\. Thus from the aforesaid provisions contained in S. 19 of the Act, it is
clear that assignment of the copyright must be in writing and signed by the
assignor or his duly authorised agent. In addition to this, the assignment
must in clear terms state the rights proposed to be assigned and the size of
the work. No other mode of assignment is valid inasmuch as when the statute
specifically provides that assignment of the copyright must be in writing and
signed by the assignor, no other mode of assignment such as oral assignment
(sic) is neither permissible nor it is valid. In fact sub-section (1) of
Section 19 of the Act in categorical terms states that no assignment of the
copy right in any work shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by
the assignor or his duly authorised agent."
7\. He also draws attention of this Court by citing a decision of the Delhi
High Court in 2008 (37) PTC 587 (Del) [Phonographic Performance Ltd., v. Hotel
Gold Regency & Others] in which it is observed on the provisions of Copy Right
Act, 1957 that the parties can only agree to do what the law permits they to
do and if they agree on something which is not permissible under law, such an
agreement to that extent would not be enforceable.
8\. In view of the provisions under Sections 18 and 19 of the Copy Right Act
1957 the assignment of copy right can only made by writing and if it is made
other than writing, it is not at all enforceable in law. When the statutory
requirement is not fulfilled, the agreement whether orally by any other means
is not sustainable.
9\. In order to obtain temporary injunction, the applicants have to show prima
facie case and the balance of convenience. But in view of the above said
observation, this Court is unable to find any prima facie case nor balance of
convenience in favour of the applicants. Hence, they have to be non-suited for
the relief prayed for. The application is liable to be dismissed.
In the result, the Original Application is dismissed without costs.
