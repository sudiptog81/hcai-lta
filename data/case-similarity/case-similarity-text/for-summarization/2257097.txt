under the provisions of Companies Act, 1956, it falls outside the purview of
the definition of consulting engineer in Section 65(31) , as the provisions
stood during the relevant period 2001-03. It requires to be noticed that with
effect from 1.5.2006, Section 65(31) was amended to bring within the ambit of
the definition of consulting engineer  , any body corporate. Prior to
1.5.2006, consulting engineer is defined to mean any professionally qualified
engineer or any other firm who either directly or indirectly renders any
advice, consultancy or technical assistance in any manner to a client in one
or more disciplines of engineering.
7\. The scope of the amendments to Section 65(31) with effect from 01.05.2006,
was considered by the Karnataka and Delhi High Courts in the aforesaid
decisions. Both Courts concluded that it is only with effect from 1.5.2006
that a body corporate comes within the ambit of consulting engineer service
in Section 65(31).
8\. In the light of the above decisions, the respondent/assessee falls outside
the purview of the definition consulting engineer, since it is a company

Appearance:
Present Ms. Suchitra Sharma, A.R. (Jt.CDR) for appellant/Revenue Present Shri
Yogendra Aldak, Advocate for the respondents Coram: Honble Mr. Justice G.
Raghuram, President Honble Mr. Rakesh Kumar, Technical Member Final Order No.
52143/2014 Per Justice G. Raghuram:
Revenue has preferred this appeal against the order passed by the Commissioner
(Appeals), Customs and Central Excise, Jaipur dated 18.5.2007 whereby the
appellate authority allowed the appeal preferred by the respondent/assessee.
2\. The Joint Commissioner, Central Excise, Jaipur I passed the adjudication
order dated 30.3.2007 confirming service tax demand of Rs.17,85,768/-, apart
from interest and penalties on the conclusion that assessee had provided
consulting engineer service, defined in Section 65 (31) read with Section 65
(105)(g) of the Finance Act, 1994 during the period 2001-03. Show cause notice
was issued alleging that the assessee had suppressed the gross consideration
received for having provided the taxable service in its ST-3 returns; and that
the suppression came to light when the ST -3 returns were compared with the
income tax returns filed by the assessee.
3\. In response, the assessee inter alia submitted that Rs.1,40,26,960/- is
the consideration received for having provided the activity of soil testing,
survey work, drilling survey to the National Highways Authority of India and
this consideration falls outside the ambit of consulting engineer service.
Another contention of the assessee was that amounts received by way of
reimbursement of expenses for providing the consulting engineer service are
liable to be excluded i.e. an amount of Rs.90,03799/-. The third defence was
that Rs.1,24,35,805/- was the service tax liability i.e. remittable by the
principal consultants, namely Louis Berger Inc. and Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick
India Pvt. Ltd. A general defence was also asserted, that since the assessee
was a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, it was outside the
ambit of the definition of consulting engineer which includes only a
consulting engineering firm; and only with effect from 1.5.2006 that Section
65(31) was amended to bring within the ambit of the definition any body
corporate.
4\. The primary authority rejected the contention of the assessee and
confirmed the liability to service tax, interest and penalties, as specified.
5\. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred an appeal. The Appellate Commissioner
allowed the appeal holding : (a) that soil testing and survey work services
provided by the assessee were outside the scope of consulting engineer
service, defined in Section 65(31) read with Section 65(105)(g); (b) since the
assessee had provided service as an associate consultant to principal
consultants, a service provided not to a client but to another consultant, the
activity falls outside the specified taxable service and is not liable to tax
as consulting engineer service. The Appellate authority also deleted
reimbursement of expenses amounts received by the assessee from the taxable
value under provisions of Section 67 of the Act. As a consequence, the appeal
of the assessee was allowed.
6\. Ld. Counsel for the respondent/assessee refers to the decision of the
Karnataka High Court and the Delhi High Court in C.S.T., Bangalore vs.
Turbotech Precision Engineering Pvt. Ltd.  2010 (18) STR 545 (Kar.) and
C.C.E.& Service Tax vs. Simplex Infrastructure & Foundry Works  2014 (34) STR
191 (Del.), for the contention that since the assessee is a company registered
under the provisions of Companies Act, 1956, it falls outside the purview of
the definition of consulting engineer in Section 65(31) , as the provisions
stood during the relevant period 2001-03. It requires to be noticed that with
effect from 1.5.2006, Section 65(31) was amended to bring within the ambit of
the definition of consulting engineer  , any body corporate. Prior to
1.5.2006, consulting engineer is defined to mean any professionally qualified
engineer or any other firm who either directly or indirectly renders any
advice, consultancy or technical assistance in any manner to a client in one
or more disciplines of engineering.
7\. The scope of the amendments to Section 65(31) with effect from 01.05.2006,
was considered by the Karnataka and Delhi High Courts in the aforesaid
decisions. Both Courts concluded that it is only with effect from 1.5.2006
that a body corporate comes within the ambit of consulting engineer service
in Section 65(31).
8\. In the light of the above decisions, the respondent/assessee falls outside
the purview of the definition consulting engineer, since it is a company
registered under the Companies Act,1956, and the relevant period is 2001-03,
prior to 1.5.2006. On the aforesaid analysis, there is no merit in Revenues
appeal which is dismissed but in the circumstances without costs.
