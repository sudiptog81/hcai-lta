    IN THE CUSTOMS, EXCISE & SERVICE TAX
    APPELLATE TRIBUNAL
    West Block No. 2, R.K. Puram, New Delhi  110 066.

    Appeal No.  ST/277/2012-CU(DB)

    M/s Whirlpool of India Ltd.                                                                       Appellant
which means that the appellant also was of the view that such technology
transfer was not in relation to IPR service. Indeed in the preceding para, it
is held that such technology transfer is not covered under IPR service.
Consequently, the appellant was not eligible to deduct the R&D cess it paid on
technology transfer from the service tax payable under IPR service as such
technology transfer was not in relation to intellectual property service. Thus
the component of impugned demand amounting to Rs.9,97,608/- is sustainable on
merit.
9\. It is seen that the components of demand on technology transfer and with
regard to R&D cess were the subject matter of an earlier show cause notice
dated 17.10.2008 issued to the appellant covering an earlier period 2005-06 &
2006-07 and therefore in the light of the judgements of Supreme Court in the
case of Nizam Sugar factory - 2006 (197) ELT 465 (SC) and Pushpam
Pharmaceutical Company Vs. CCE, Bombay  1995 (78) ELT 401 (SC) the extended
period in the present case is not invocable which will make these components
of the impugned demand time-barred because the show cause notice was issued on
    M/s Whirlpool of India Ltd.                                                                       Appellant

Appearance Shri Tarun Gulati, Advocate - for the appellant Shri Kishore Kumar,
Advocate Shri Amresh Jain, DR  for the respondent CORAM: Honble Mr. Justice
G. Raghuram, President Honble Mr. R.K. Singh, Member (Technical) Final Order
No. 53908/2015 Per R.K. Singh :
Appeal is filed against order in original dated 29/11/2011 in terms of which
service tax demand of Rs. 77,56,528/- for the period April 2005 to March 2008
was confirmed along with interest and penalties.
2\. In terms of the impugned order the Commissioner has confirmed the
following demands along with penalties.
(i) Service Tax of Rs.45,29,167/- on the Technology Transfer fee paid to
Whirlpool, USA during April, 2007 to March, 2008 under Section 73(1) of the
Finance Act, 1994 (the Act) along with appropriate interest under Section 75
of the Act;
(ii) Service Tax of Rs.9,97,608/- short paid on Brand Fee under Section 73(1)
of the Act along with appropriate interest under Section 75 of the Act;
(iii) Cenvat credit of Rs.22,29,753/- for non-maintenance of separate records
for taxable and exempted services under Rule 14 of Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004
(CCR) and Section 73 of the Finance Act, 1994 (the Act) along with
appropriate interest under Section 75 of the Act.
3\. The appellant, apart from manufacturing goods, is also engaged in
providing taxable services. It is also registered as input service
distributor. The adjudicating authority confirmed the impugned demand
essentially on the following grounds:
(i) No service tax was paid on the technology transfer fee by the Appellant
which was taxable under intellectual property rights service;
(ii) The appellant utilized excess CENVAT Credit during the period of April,
2007 to March 2008 and is liable to pay the excess amount of credit taken as
per the provision of Rule 14 of CCR read with Section 73 of the Act, based for
the following reasons:
a. That the Appellant is providing taxable as well as exempted services and
has not maintained separate accounts for dutiable and exempted services.
b. The exception provided under Rule 6(6) of the CCR is not applicable in case
services are cleared for export under the Export of Services Rules, 2005.
c. The Appellant is not authorised to avail credit of more than 20% of Service
Tax payable on taxable services for the period April 207 to March 2008.
(iii) The deduction of R&D cess by the Appellant from service tax paid on
brand fee under IPR services for the period of 2007-08 was not admissible.
4\. The appellant has contended that:
(i) The impugned order is based on non-application of mind. It does not
specify what were exempted services rendered by it.
(ii) While confirming the demand under intellectual property rights service
the Commissioner did not give any finding on the various submissions of the
appellant.
(iii) The technology transfer fee was paid to Whirlpool USA for receiving
technical know-how which is not covered in the taxable category of
intellectual property rights service.
(iv) Commissioner did not take into account that the benefit of notification
17/2004  ST was admissible in respect of R&D cess paid on technical transfer
fee.
(v) Extended period is not invocable as there was no suppression or wilful
misstatement and there is no finding that there was any wilful mis-statement
or suppression with intent to evade service tax.
(vi) An order passed without taking into account the contentions of the
appellant is bad in law as has been held in the case of CCE Vs. Sheetal
International - 2010 (259) ELT 165 (Supreme Court).
(vii) The appellant was not providing any exempted services and therefore
there were no requirement for maintaining separate account and so there was no
limit of 20% on utilisation of CENVAT credit and the Commissioner has
acknowledged this fact and still confirmed the demand.
(viii) Technology transfer fee is not liable to service tax under the
definition of IP service and detailed submissions of the appellant were not
taken into account while confirming the demand under this head. The agreement
between Whirlpool Corporation, USA and the appellant clearly shows that it was
an agreement for technology transfer and not for intellectual property. As per
the agreement the purpose was supply of technology/information available with
Whirlpool USA and therefore does not fall within the scope of intellectual
property right. It was paying service tax on the brand fees under intellectual
property rights service.
(ix) R&D cess has been paid on technology transfers and the service tax on the
brand fee under intellectual property rights service was rightly paid after
deduction of such R&D cess in terms of Notification 17/2004-ST as is evident
from the language of the said notification.
(x) As in the extended period of limitation is not invocable in the present
case as there was no wilful misstatement or suppression of facts, the demand
is time-barred. The demands on technical transfer fee and relating to R&D cess
were similarly raised earlier in a show cause notice dated 17/10/2008 for the
period 2005  06 and 2006  07 and therefore the extended period cannot be
invoked as in respect of these two components of demand, Revenue was already
aware of the facts.
The appellant cited several judgements in support of its proposition which
will be duly adverted to in due course.
5\. Ld. Department representative contended that:
(1) In the ST 3 returns filed by the appellant for the period April 2007 to
September 2007 and October 2007 to March 2008 it mentioned to be providing
taxable service as well as exempted service.
(2) Services exported are to be treated in exempted services.
(3) Technology transfer agreement is enforceable under the Indian law
(contract act) and therefore would be covered under IP service.
(4) R&D cess paid in respect of technology transfer fee cannot be offset
against the service tax paid under intellectual property rights service on the
brand fees paid by the appellant.
6\. We have considered the contentions of both sides. As regards the component
of demand pertaining to excess utilisation of CENVAT credit (beyond 20%) on
the ground that the appellant provided taxable as well exempted services and
did not maintain separate accounts, and therefore utilisation of CENVAT credit
to the extent of Rs. 22,29,753/- was in excess of what was permitted in terms
of Rule 6 of the CENVAT Credit Rules 2004, the appellant has vehemently
pleaded that it was not providing any exempted service at all and no such
service has been identified in the show cause notice which we find is borne
out from the perusal of the show cause notice. We find that the copy of the
ST-3 return (on P-126 of appeal papers) submitted by the appellant shows that
it was not providing any exempted service. The contention of ld. DR that the
ST-3 returns referred to in the show cause notice (page 168 of the appeal
papers) are different from the ST 3 return referred to by the appellant, the
appellant maintained that it was not providing any exempted service and the
Revenue could not show copies of the ST3 returns referred to in the show cause
notice to substantiate its contention. We may however hasten to add that an ST
-3 return cannot be a conclusive evidence of providing/not providing exempted
service. The adjudicating authority in its order has recorded the following
finding with regard to this issue:
The SCN has not specified as to which services are taken as exempted and
which services are taken as taxable. Only when it is proved that the noticee
was providing exempted as well as taxable services that it can be held guilty
of availing and utilizing CENVAT credit of service tax in excess of 20% of
Service Tax paid on taxable service. Mere averment in the SCN cannot lead the
adjudicating authority in deciding the case against the Noticee. The SCN has
to come up with specific details of such allegation. However, this view of the
adjudicating authority has not been accepted in review in noticees similar
case for previous period. In view of the foregoing and guided by the principal
of judicial discipline, I am bound to adopt the views taken in review by the
Committee of Chief Commissioners and hold that the notice is providing
exempted service along with taxable services and hence, they were not
permitted to avail/utilise in excess of 20% of Service Tax paid on taxable
services since they were not maintaining separate records. The adjudicating
authority is thus categorical in its finding that the onus to prove that the
appellant was providing any exempted services has not been discharged by
Revenue. The adjudicating authority is however wholly wrong in observing that
judicial discipline requires him to be bound by the views of the Review
Committee of Chief Commissioners. Adjudicating authority is only bound by the
orders of the superior adjudicating authority like CESTAT and the observations
of the Committee of Chief Commissioners are of administrative nature and not
of quasi-judicial nature to have any binding effect on adjudicating authority.
Thus there is no doubt that even in the opinion of the adjudicating authority,
component of demand confirmed on account of non-maintenance of separate
accounts of taxable and exempted services is not sustainable.
7\. As regards the demand under IPR service on technology transfer fee, we
have perused the agreement relating thereto entered into between Whirlpool
Corporation USA and the appellant. The agreement is available on pages 15 to
18 of the appeal papers. It is evident from the agreement that it is only for
the purpose of technical assistance pertaining to products so as to allow the
appellant to design, manufacture and service products, parts or subassemblies
therefor and to have appellants parts suppliers make parts or subassemblies
for appellant to be assembled into products. Articles 1, II and III and VII of
the said agreement are reproduced below for convenience:
ARTICLE 1 6. The term Technical Assistance shall mean the supply by
WHIRLPOOL to WOI of specific information and services relating to a Product
based on the Technology supplied under Article II so as to allow WOI to
design, manufacture and service such appliance or sub-assembly, and to have
the WOI parts suppliers make Parts or Sub-Assemblies, therefore, Technical
Assistance includes, but is not limited to, the items set forth in EXHIBIT B
attached hereto.
7\. The term Technology shall mean all of; the state of the art information
and data or rights to such information and data, whether patented or
unpatented, relating to the design, manufacture and service of the Products,
originating within WHIRPOOLs organization as a result of research and
product/process development activities. Technology includes, but is not
limited to, all patents and patent applications, all copyrights, copyright
registrations and applications, literary works, audio visual works, software,
computer programs and processes, trade secrets, know-how, drawings
specifications, lists of materials and other written or machine readable
technical or business information relating to the design, manufacture or
service of the Products.
ARTICLE-II Supply of Technology 2.1 Subject to the limitations set forth below
in Article IV and Section 2.3 of the Article II, WHIRLPOOL agrees to make
available to WOI, all of its Technology, whether developed or acquired, and
hereby grants to WOI an exclusive license in India to such Technology supplied
to WOI in accordance with Articles III and V of this Agreement. As to
Technology developed or acquired during the term of this Agreement, WHIRLPOOL
agrees to make available such Technology on a prompt and regular basis.
2.3 ..................
ARTICLE-III Technical Assistance 3.1 WHHIRPOOL shall supply to WOI from time
to time, Technical Assistant pertaining to Products, so as to allow WOI to
design, manufacture and service Products, Parts or Sub-Assemblies therefore,
and to have WOIs parts suppliers make Parts or Sub-Assemblies for WOI to be
assembled into Products by WOI, or for sale by WOI as repair parts for
Products manufactured or assembled by WOI.
ARTICLE VII Royalties 8.1 The products shall be deemed to have been sold, and
royalties as specified in this Section shall accrue, when the Products are
billed by WOI, if any Products are sold by WOI to any affiliated or related
persons, then the royalties payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of prices charged to purchasers who are not so related or affiliated. There
shall be no separate charge for parts or sub-assemblies included in a finished
appliances product subject to the above royalty.
8.2 The royalties shall be calculated and paid quarterly, WOI shall prepare
statements for each quarter ending on the last day of March, June, September
and December and each calendar year, setting up out the quantity of the
Products sold, the sale price of the products, and the deductions made
therefrom for determining the net ex-factory sales price and such other
particulars as WHIRLPOOL may reasonably request to enable it to determine and
verify the royalties payable to it under this Agreement. Each statement,
together with the total amount of the royalties due, shall be delivered to
WHIRLPOOL within forty five (45) days from the end of the quarter covered by
such statement.
8.3 WOI shall, during the term of this Agreement and for one year after
expiration or termination hereof, maintain accurate records in the English
language containing all data reasonably necessary to enable WHIRLPOOL to
determine the total quantity of Products manufactured and sold and the sale
price thereof, WOI shall permit a duly authorised representative or Chartered
Accountant, appointed by WHIRLPOOL, at its cost, to inspect the said books and
records and make copies of extracts therefrom during regular business hours.
8.4 All payments under this Agreement shall be made to WHIRLPOOL in United
States Dollars at such place as may be designated by WHIRLPOOL from time to
time. WOI shall apply to the Reserve Bank/Authorised Dealer in Foreign
Exchange for permission to remit the sums due to WHIRLPOOL as soon as possible
and shall pursue all such applications diligently. It is evident that the
agreement is entered for the purpose of supply of technology/technical
assistance/information by Whirlpool, USA to the appellant and the remuneration
received by Whirlpool, USA is only for the use of the same by the appellant.
There is nothing on record that any of the said technology/technical know-
how/information is registered or patented under Indian law. Intellectual
property right it defined in section 65 (55) (a) and (b) is as under:
[(55a) "intellectual property right" means any right to intangible property,
namely, trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible
property, under any law for the time being in force, but does not include
copyright;
(55b) "intellectual property service" means, -
(a) transferring, 3[temporarily;] or
(b) permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right;] The
appellant is also paying to Whirlpool, USA brand fee on which it is
discharging service tax. The amount on which service tax has not been paid
relates to technical assistance and supply of technology by Whirlpool USA in
terms of the said agreement. Transfer of technology and technical assistance
do not fall in the ambit of intellectual property rights service as Revenue
has not shown that they were recognised under any law in India during the
relevant period of 2007  08. Central board of Excise and Customs vide
circular No. 80/10/2004 dated 17/09/2004 clarified the scope of intellectual
property rights service as under:
Intellectual property emerges from 9.1 application of intellect, which may be
in the form of an invention, design, product, process, technology, book
goodwill etc. In India, legislations are made in respect of certain
Intellectual Property Rights (i.e. IPRs) such as patents, copyrights,
trademarks and designs. The definition of taxable service includes only such
IPRs (except copyright) that are prescribed under law for the time being in
force. As the phrase law for the time being in force implies such laws as
are applicable in India, IPRs covered under Indian law in force at present
alone are chargeable to service tax and IPRs like integrated circuits or
undisclosed information (not covered by Indian law) would not be covered under
taxable services.
Thus only such intellectual property rights which are covered under Indian law
in force alone are chargeable to service tax under IPR service. The
Commissioner does not identify any Indian law under which the technology
transfer and technical assistance involved in this case is covered. The
Commissioner has confirmed the demand under intellectual property rights
service essentially by observing as under:
A reading of the Technical Transfer Agreement between the Noticee and
Whirlpool, USA with a reading of the above mentioned definitions clearly
establishes that Technical Transfer Fee is eligible to Service Tax under
Intellectual Property Service and accordingly Service Tax on the same is
recoverable from the Noticee. As is evident, the Commissioner has not taken
into account the contentions of the appellant and has come to summary
conclusion that technology transfer fee is liable to service tax under
Intellectual Property Service. We find it totally nonspeaking and devoid of
any reasoning. In the case of Tata Consultancy Services Vs. Commercial Service
Tax - 2015  TIOL  2370  CESTAT  Mumbai it was held by CESTAT that
intellectual property rights not covered by the Indian laws would not be
covered under taxable service in the category of IP services. In the case of
Thermax Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise Pune - 2013  TIOL  1092 
CESTAT  Mumbai it was held that payment for use of trade secret is not
covered within the ambit of intellectual property service as there is no law
governing trade secrets/confidential information in India.
8\. Coming to the demand on account of deduction of R&D cess from service tax
paid on brand fee under IPR service, we notice that notification No. 17/2004
dated 10/09/2004 states as under:
On exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 93 of the
Finance Act, 1994 (32 of 1994), the Central Government being satisfied that it
is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby exempts the taxable
service provided by the holder of intellectual property right to any person,
in relation to intellectual property service, from so much of the service tax
leviable thereon under Section 66 of the said Act, as is equivalent to the
amount of cess paid towards the import of technology under the provisions of
Section 3 of the Research and Development Cess Act, 1986 (32 of 1986) in
relation to such intellectual property service. It is evident that in terms
of the above notification, service tax on IPR service is exempt only to the
extent of the R&D cess paid towards the import of technology under the
provisions of Section 3 of the R&D Cess Act, 1986 in relation to such
intellectual property service (emphasis added). It is admitted that no service
tax was paid under IPR service on the amount paid for such technology transfer
which means that the appellant also was of the view that such technology
transfer was not in relation to IPR service. Indeed in the preceding para, it
is held that such technology transfer is not covered under IPR service.
Consequently, the appellant was not eligible to deduct the R&D cess it paid on
technology transfer from the service tax payable under IPR service as such
technology transfer was not in relation to intellectual property service. Thus
the component of impugned demand amounting to Rs.9,97,608/- is sustainable on
merit.
9\. It is seen that the components of demand on technology transfer and with
regard to R&D cess were the subject matter of an earlier show cause notice
dated 17.10.2008 issued to the appellant covering an earlier period 2005-06 &
2006-07 and therefore in the light of the judgements of Supreme Court in the
case of Nizam Sugar factory - 2006 (197) ELT 465 (SC) and Pushpam
Pharmaceutical Company Vs. CCE, Bombay  1995 (78) ELT 401 (SC) the extended
period in the present case is not invocable which will make these components
of the impugned demand time-barred because the show cause notice was issued on
05/04/2010 for the period up to March 2008.
10\. In the light of the foregoing analysis, we do not find impugned demand
sustainable and therefore the same is set aside and the appeal allowed.
