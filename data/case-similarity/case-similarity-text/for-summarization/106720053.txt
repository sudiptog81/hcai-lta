    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN
    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV NARULA
                                  JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J: (Oral)
we should examine the matter afresh or refer the matter to a larger bench. We
are not inclined to agree with Mr. Agarwal. The precise question urged by Mr.
Agarwal has been answered against the Revenue in the above- noted decisions.
It is also pertinent note that the Special Leave Petitions challenging the
judgments of the Division Benches have been dismissed. Consequently, the
issues of law and fact raised by the learned counsel for petitioners are no
longer res integra. We do not any infirmity in the approach adopted by the
AAR. We are therefore not inclined so as to exercise our jurisdiction under
Article 226 and entertain the present petition to take a different view.
Dismissed.
9\. Before parting, we would like to add that the judgement in the case of
Sudhir Chandra Nawn (supra) is clearly inapplicable to the facts of the
present case as it only states that even if the formula for calculation of tax
liability under two different statutes enacted under different entries in List
III of Schedule VII of the Constitution is similar, that would not make the
fields of legislation under the two entries overlapping.
MANMOHAN, J: (Oral)
1\. The petition has been heard by way of video conferencing.
2\. Present writ petition has been filed challenging the order dated 24th
June, 2019 passed by Authority for Advance Rulings on the ground that it is in
violation of the jurisdictional bar under proviso to Section 245R(2) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the „Act‟). Petitioner also
prays for a declaration to the effect that only the petitioner has the
jurisdiction to deal with the case of respondent No. 2 [ Crocs Europe BV] and
Respondent No. 1 has no jurisdiction to deal with the same. Petitioner further
prays for a stay on the operation of the impugned order. The relevant W.P. (C)
5668/2020 Page 1 of 7 portion of the impugned order is reproduced
hereinbelow:-
> ".......It is vehemently urged before us that the question on which notice
> under Section 143(2) of the Act was issued was "taxable income shown in
> revised return is less than the taxable income shown in the original return
> and large refund has been claimed" and the question whether royalty is
> taxable on paid basis has direct repercussion on the determination of
> refund. It is submitted that therefore the question raised by the applicant
> is pending before the Assessing Authority.
> At the cost of repetition, we must state that notice under Section 143(2)
> merely asks the applicant to produce any evidence on which it may like to
> rely in support of its return. It does not even remotely disclose any
> application of mind to the return filed by the applicant. It is clear from
> the judgments of the High Court of Delhi referred to hereinabove that if
> there is no application of mind to the question raised by the applicant in
> the notice under Section 143(2), the said question cannot be stated to be
> "pending" to attract clause (i) of the proviso to Section 245R(2) of the
> Act. Hence this objection raised by the Departmental Representative is
> rejected."
3\. Mr. Agarwal, Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned
order is liable to be quashed as the application of respondent No. 2 was not
maintainable before respondent No. 1 because of non-existence of
"Jurisdictional Fact". He refers to the report under Section 245R(2) filed by
the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax to point out that the main issue before
the Assessing Officer in the scrutiny proceedings is the same as before the
Authority for Advance Rulings namely whether the royalty is taxable in the
hands of the petitioners at the time of actual receipt or otherwise. He argues
that since the questions raised in the Application before the Respondent No 1
were already pending before the Assessing Officer, the Respondent No 1 was
barred from assuming jurisdiction in view W.P. (C) 5668/2020 Page 2 of 7 of
the threshold bar enshrined in clause (i) under Proviso to section 245 R (2)
of the Act.
4\. Learned counsel further submits that the Authority for Advance Rulings is
bound to follow the mandatory statutory procedure and if the entire record and
notice alone had not been examined by it, then the conclusion of the Authority
would have been different. He states that though the notice under Section
143(2) is in a standard pre-printed format, yet it is in accordance with the
specific language used in Sections 142(1) and 143(2) of the Act. In support of
his submissions, learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon the judgment
of the Supreme Court in the case of Sudhir Chandra Nawn Vs. Wealth Tax
Officer, Calcutta & Ors., (1969) 1 SCR 108. The relevant portion of the
judgment relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioners is as under:-
> "3.......The tax which is imposed by Entry 86 List I of the Seventh Schedule
> is not directly a tax on lands and buildings. It is a tax imposed on the
> capital value of the assets of individuals and companies, on the valuation
> date. The tax is not imposed on the components of the assets of the
> assessee: it is imposed on the total assets which the assessee owns, and in
> determining the net wealth not only the encumbrances specifically charged
> against any item of asset, but the general liability of the assessee to pay
> his debts and to discharge his lawful obligations have to be taken into
> account. In certain exceptional cases, where a person owes no debts and is
> under no enforceable obligation to discharge any liability out of his
> assets, it may be possible to break up the tax which is leviable on the
> total assets into components and attribute a component to lands and
> buildings owned by an assessee. In such a case, the component out of the
> total tax attributable to lands and buildings may in the matter of
> computation bear similarity to a tax on lands and buildings levied on the
> capital or annual value under Entry 49 List II. But the legislative
> authority of Parliament is not determined by visualizing the possibility of
> exceptional cases of W.P. (C) 5668/2020 Page 3 of 7 taxes under two
> different heads operating similarly on tax payers. Again Entry 49 List II of
> the Seventh Schedule contemplates the levy of tax on lands and buildings or
> both as units. It is normally not concerned with the division of interest or
> ownership in the units of lands or buildings which are brought to tax. Tax
> on lands and buildings is directly imposed on lands and buildings, and bears
> a definite relation to it. Tax on the capital value of assets bears no
> definable relation to lands and buildings which may form a component of the
> total assets of the assessee. By legislation in exercise of power under
> Entry 86 List I tax is contemplated to be levied on the value of the assets.
> For the purpose of levying tax under Entry 49 List II the State Legislature
> may adopt for determining the incidence of tax the annual or the capital
> value of the lands and buildings. But the adoption of the annual or capital
> value of lands and buildings for determining tax liability will not, in our
> judgment, make the fields of legislation under the two entries overlapping."
5\. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners and having perused the
records on record, this Court finds that the revised return has been selected
for scrutiny under computer aided selection system (CASS) and a notice dated
16th August, 2018 under Section 143(2) of the Act had been issued to the
petitioners. The admitted reason for selection of respondents‟ case for
scrutiny is "taxable income shown in revised return is less than the taxable
income shown in the original return and large refund has been claimed". In
contrast the question admitted for Ruling is "Whether on the facts and
circumstances of the case and in law, the Royalty receivable by the Applicant
from Crocs India Private Limited ("Crocs India") for use of intellectual
property rights ("IPR") relating to design, development, marketing,
distribution etc would be taxable in the hands of Applicant only at the time
of actual receipt under Article 12 of Agreement between India and Netherlands
for avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal W.P. (C) 5668/2020
Page 4 of 7 evasion ("Treaty") ?
6\. Two Division Benches of this Court in Hyosung Corporation vs. Authority
for Advance Rulings & Ors., (2016) 382 ITR 371 (Delhi) and Sage Publication
Ltd. Vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income-Tax (International Taxation), (2016)
387 ITR 437 (Delhi) have held that a question cannot be said to be pending
under Clause (i) of proviso to Section 245R(2) upon issuance of a mere notice
under Section 143(2) of the Act, especially when it has been issued in a
standard pre-printed format and the questions raised before the authority for
advance ruling do not appear to be forming the subject matter of the said
notice. This is also more so when the notice fails to satisfy the particulars
of claim of loss, exemption, deduction, allowance or relief as mandated by
Section 143(2)(i) of the Act. The relevant portions of the said judgments are
respectively reproduced hereinbelow:-
A) Hyosung Corporation Vs. Authority for Advance Rulings & Ors.
> "When can a question be stated to be "pending"?
> xxx xxx xxx
> 27\. As far as the notice under Section 143(2) of the Act is concerned, that
> provision itself stipulates that such notice will be issued by the AO where
> he has reason to believe that any claim of such exemption, deduction,
> allowance or relief made in return is inadmissible. It mandates that the
> notice should specify the particulars of such claim, loss, exemption,
> deduction or relief. Turning to the notice issued in the instant case to the
> Petitioner under Section 143(2) of the Act, it is seen that it is in a
> standard pre-printed format which merely states that "there are certain
> points in connection with the return of income on which the AO would like
> some further information". The said notice fails to satisfy the particulars
> of claim of loss, exemption, deduction, allowance or relief as mandated by
> Section 143(2)(i) W.P. (C) 5668/2020 Page 5 of 7 of the Act. In any event
> the question raised in the applications by the Petitioner before the AAR do
> not appear to be forming the subject matter of the notices under Section
> 143(2) of the Act. Consequently, the mere fact that such a notice was issued
> prior to the filing of the application by the Petitioner before the AAR will
> not constitute a bar, in terms of clause (i) to proviso to Section 245R(2)
> of the Act, on the AAR entertaining and allowing the applications."
B) Sage Publication Ltd. Vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (International
Taxation) "It is evident on a plain reading of the notice that it does not
address itself to any specific question; it does not even disclose application
of mind to the returns save and except the fact that they conform to the
instructions which compelled the Assessing Officer to issue a scrutiny notice
on account of the international transaction reported by the assessee. The
previous authority of this Court in Hyosung (supra) and L.S. Cable (supra) had
the occasion to deal with identical notices. It was positively ruled that such
notices ipso facto would be insufficient to attract the automatic rejection
route under proviso to Section 245R(2) of the Act. Consequently, we have no
hesitation in holding that the impugned order of the Ruling Authority in
rejecting the application is untenable. Consequently, the order is quashed and
set aside. The petitioner's application shall now be processed and
independently dealt with on its merits in accordance with law by the Ruling
Authority. The parties shall be present before the Advance Ruling Authority on
13.09.2016. The writ petition is allowed in the above terms."
7\. The AAR has followed the above-noted decisions and held notice under
section 143(2) merely asks the applicant to produce any evidence on which it
may like to rely in support of its return. It does not even remotely disclose
any application of mind to the return filed by the applicant. For this reason,
AAR has held that that question cannot be said to be pending to W.P. (C)
5668/2020 Page 6 of 7 attract the bar under clause (i) of the proviso to
Section 245R(2) of the Act.
8\. Mr. Agarwal tried to impress upon us that the aforesaid judgments do not
deal with the jurisdictional ground urged by him in the present petition and
we should examine the matter afresh or refer the matter to a larger bench. We
are not inclined to agree with Mr. Agarwal. The precise question urged by Mr.
Agarwal has been answered against the Revenue in the above- noted decisions.
It is also pertinent note that the Special Leave Petitions challenging the
judgments of the Division Benches have been dismissed. Consequently, the
issues of law and fact raised by the learned counsel for petitioners are no
longer res integra. We do not any infirmity in the approach adopted by the
AAR. We are therefore not inclined so as to exercise our jurisdiction under
Article 226 and entertain the present petition to take a different view.
Dismissed.
9\. Before parting, we would like to add that the judgement in the case of
Sudhir Chandra Nawn (supra) is clearly inapplicable to the facts of the
present case as it only states that even if the formula for calculation of tax
liability under two different statutes enacted under different entries in List
III of Schedule VII of the Constitution is similar, that would not make the
fields of legislation under the two entries overlapping.
10\. The order be uploaded on the website forthwith. Copy of the order be also
forwarded to the learned counsel through e-mail.
