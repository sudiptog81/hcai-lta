         IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA, BENGALURU
              DATED THIS THE 11TH DAY OF JULY 2018
                              PRESENT
             THE HON'BLE DR.JUSTICE VINEET KOTHARI

               THE HON'BLE MRS.JUSTICE S.SUJATHA

           RASHTROTHANA BHAVAN
57\. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be
applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may
be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found
certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an 'Arm's Length
Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be
satisfied and have filed such appeals before Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA
No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India
Pvt. Ltd.,  21/21 this Court. Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction
with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a
sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
58\. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as
to costs."
12\. In the circumstances, having heard the learned Counsel appearing for both
the sides, we are of the considered opinion that no substantial question of
law arises for consideration in the present case.
13\. Hence, the Appeal filed by the Appellants-

Mr. K.V.Aravind, Adv. for Appellants - Revenue. Mr. K.R.Vasudevan, Adv. for
Respondent - Assessee.
This Appeal is filed by the Revenue purportedly raising substantial questions
of law arising from the Order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore
Bench 'A', Bangalore, in ITA No.1121/Bang/2011 dated 22.03.2013, relating to
the Assessment Year 2007-08.
2\. The appeal has been admitted on 12.09.2014 to consider the substantial
questions of law as indicated in the memorandum of appeal.
Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax &
Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  3/21
3\. The substantial questions of law framed by the Revenue in the Memorandum
of Appeal are as under:
> "1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the
> Tribunal was right in super imposing the decisions of the other benches and
> the decision of the ITAT while rejecting the comparables [(i) Accel
> Transmatic Limited, (ii) Avani Cimcon Technologies Limited,

> 2\. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances and of the case in law the
> Tribunal was justified in fixing the related party transaction filtered at

> 6\. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the
> Tribunal was right in holding that, write off of interest free deposit was a

> the relevant year or in the previous year and recorded a perverse finding?
> Regarding sixth substantial question of law:-
4\. Learned Counsel for the Revenue submitted that under the provisions of
Section 36(2)(i) of the Act, before deduction of a bad debt or part thereof
claimed as deduction, such debt or deposit ought to have been included in the
income of the Assessee in the same year Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA
No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India
Pvt. Ltd.,  6/21 or in the previous year. He submitted that the Assessing
Authority was justified in making the disallowance of the bad debts claimed as
the Rental Deposit made by the assessee as a lessee/tenant with the landlord
which could not be recovered from landlord on account of the order of the
Court and the Tribunal has wrongly allowed the same under Section 36(2)(i) of
the Act. Hence, a substantial question of law arises in the matter.
5\. Learned counsel for the Assessee supported the findings of the learned
Tribunal in this regard.
6\. The relevant paragraphs from the order of Tribunal in this regard are
quoted below for ready reference:
> "Ground No.3 Disallowance of "Deposits Written Off":
During the year, the assessee company has debited an amount of Rs.24,93,600
under the heading of 'Deposits written Off'. On calling for further details of
the same and substantiation for Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013
The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,
7/21 deduction, the assessee, by letter dated 16.08.2010, has submitted as
follows;
We submit that the company has made a provision for bad and doubtful deposits
in respect of the rental deposit made to its landlord, in the earlier
assessment years as under:
    Assessment Year        Amount of Provision made [Rs.]
        2005-06                            8,10,420
        2006-07                            16,83,180
        TOTAL                             24,93,600
             The    Honorable         High         Court         of
Karnataka has disallowed the petition filed by the company for the recovery of
the said rental deposit.
In this scenario, the company has written off the rental advance in its books
by reversing the provision made in past towards bad and doubtful deposits.
Thus, we submit that since the provision was disallowed in the earlier
assessment years in which it was created, the reversal of such provision
should be allowed as an allowable deduction for the current assessment year
2007-08.
Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax &
Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  8/21 The contention of the assessee
is not acceptable. It is seen that the assessee has incurred these charges by
writing off the rental deposit, given to Mrs. Rita Janssen, for four units
rented by it in second floor of Embassy Diamante, #34, Vittal Mallya Road,
Bangalore. The deposit is always shown as a balance sheet item in the
financial statements. When something is written off as not receivable, the
Income Tax Act, 1961 requires it to be first shown as income as mentioned
under Section 36(2)(i) and then to be claimed as an expenditure, on becoming
bad.
But in this case, the deposits have never been shown as income in the P & L
Account. These are deposits shown as current assets in the Balance Sheet of
the company. Therefore they cannot be written off and claimed as a revenue
expenditure in the P & L Account. This deduction is not allowable as per the
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Therefore the amount of Rs.24,93,600/- is disallowed u/s 36 and 37 and is
added back in the hands of the assessee."
> Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax
> & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  9/21
> 7\. However, learned Tribunal allowed the said deduction as Bad Debts u/s.
> 36 [2] [i] plaintiff the Act with the following observations:
> "6.3 We have carefully considered the submissions of the assessee as well as
> the Departmental Representative on the issue. The Hon'ble Mumbai Bench 'F',
> in the case of United Motors [India] Limited v. ITO, reported in [2010] 6
> Taxmann.com 32 [Mum], wherein a similar issue to that of present issue under
> consideration had come up for consideration. After hearing the rival
> parties, the Hon'ble Bench had observed that 'Whether since by making
> interest-free deposits for purpose of obtaining permissive use or licence to
> use premises, assessee did not obtain any enduring advantage or interest in
> properties, loss of security deposit and write off of same against rental of
> properties was a loss incidental to business and, thus, assessing officer
> was right in allowing said amount as a deduction.' 6.4 In conformity with
> the findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal on a similar issue
> [supra], we are of the firm view that the write off of the interest free
> deposit made by Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The
> Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,
> 10/21 the assessee to the licensor against rental properties was a loss
> incidental to the business and, hence, the assessee was entitled to claim
> the same as allowable deduction. It is ordered accordingly."
> 8\. Provisions of Section 36(2)(i) are quoted below for ready reference:
> "[2] In making any deduction for a bad debt or part thereof, the following
> provisions shall apply -
> [i] no such deduction shall be allowed unless such debt or part thereof has
> been taken into account in computing the income of the assessee of the
> previous year in which the amount of such debt or part thereof is written
> off or of an earlier previous year, or represents money lent in the ordinary
> course of the business of banking or money-lending which is carried on by
> the assessee."
> 9\. Having considered the rival submissions, we are of the opinion that no
> substantial question of law arises on the said issue and the learned
> Tribunal was justified in following the view taken by the Mumbai Date of
> Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax &
> Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  11/21 Bench of Tribunal in the
> case of United Motors [India] Limited v. ITO reported in [2010] 6
> Taxmann.com 32 [Mum], quoted above. The Rental Deposit in question made by
> the assessee company as a tenant/lessee with the landlady Mrs. Rita Janssen
> became non-refundable under the Court orders and the assessee had to forego
> the 'Rental Deposits' which thus became a bad debt.
The Assessing Authority itself has found that the provisions made for such
doubtful debts were allowed by the Assessing Authority in the previous years
and thus such provision was obviously taken into account while determining the
income of the assessee in the previous year. The said Rental Deposit which was
shown as 'Current Assets' was written off in the present assessment year and
once that Deposit became non-
refundable under the Court order in a settlement of dispute between the
Assessee and the landlady which was written off in this assessment year, the
requirements of Section 36(2)(i) of the Act was clearly Date of Judgment
11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s.
LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  12/21 satisfied by the assessee in the present case
and therefore allowance made by the learned Tribunal in the impugned order was
perfectly justified and in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In our
considered view, no substantial question of law arises.
10\. The learned Tribunal, after discussing the rival contentions of both the
Appellants-Revenue and Respondent-Assessee, has returned a finding as under:
Regarding substantial questions of law Nos.1 and 3:-
> "[ii] Functional dissimilarity:
> 3.7. We shall now deal with the improper selection of comparables by the TPO
> for the reasons that they were functionally different, as held by the
> Tribunal in the cases of Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd.,
> Telecordia Technologies India Private Limited and M/s. CSR India Pvt. Ltd.,
> [a] Accel Transmatic Limited [seg]:
The section of this company by the TPO was duly considered by the Tribunal in
the Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-
tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  13/21 case of Trilogy
E-Business and the reason recorded in its finding is extracted as under:
> "xxxxx"
          [b]   Avani       Cimcon           Technologies
    Limited:
          The   selection      of    this     company          as
comparable by the TPO was rejected by the earlier order of the Tribunal in the
case of Trilogy E-Business for the reasons that:
> "xxxxx"
> [c] Celestial Labs Limited:
This company was also selected by the TPO as comparable. However, on due
consideration of the issue, the earlier Bench in Trilogy E-Business had opined
that this company cannot be as comparable on the ground that -
> "xxxxx"
          (d)   KALS          Information               System
    Limited (seg):
Incidentally, the selection of this company as comparable by the TPO was
rejected by the earlier Bench in the case of Trilogy E-Business on Date of
Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another
Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  14/21 the premise that the information
obtained by the TPO by issuance of notice u/s 133(6) of the Act was not,
however, available in public domain. The reasons recorded, for appreciation of
facts, are extracted hereunder:
"xxxxx"
3.7.1. In conformity with the finding of the coordinate bench of the Tribunal
in the case of Triology E-business, we are of the considered view that (i)
Accel Transmatic Limited (seg); (ii) Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.; (iii)
Celestial Labs Limited & (iv) KALS Information System Limited (seg) cannot
qualify as comparables in the case of the assessee under consideration. It is
ordered accordingly.
(e) Lucid Software Limited:
The above company has been rejected as comparable in the case of Telecordia
Technologies Pvt. Limited v. ACIT (supra). The findings of the Hon'ble Mumbai
Tribunal are reproduced below:
"xxxxx"
The objections of the present assessee are identical to the objections raised
against the inclusion of Lucid Software in the case of Date of Judgment
11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s.
LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  15/21 Telcordia Technologies. Since the facts and
the assessment year are identical, following the order of the Tribunal in the
case of Telcordia Technologies Pvt. Ltd v. CIT (supra) we direct the assessing
officer / TPO not to include Lucid Software Limited as a comparable. The above
company was also excluded as comparable in the case of M/s. CSR India Pvt.
Ltd., [ITA No.1119/Bang/2011]."
Regarding second substantial question of law:-
"(iii) Related party transaction: 3.8. Ishir Infotech Limited: The assessee
had objected to the inclusion of Ishir Infotech Limited as a comparable being
related party transaction in excess of 15% of total sales/revenue. The TPO had
set a limit of 25% on the related party transaction. According to the
assessee, the recent order of the Tribunal in the case of 24/7 Customer Com
Private Ltd. had held that if comparable company has related party transaction
exceeded 15% of the total sales/revenue, the same should not be comparable.
3.8.1. The learned DR present was duly heard.
Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax &
Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  16/21 3.8.2. The Tribunal in the
case of 24/7 Customer Com Private Ltd. had held that if the related party
transaction exceeded 15% of the total sales/revenue, the same cannot be taken
as a comparable. The relevant contention that was raised and the finding of
the Tribunal read as follows:-
"xxxxx"
3.8.3. The Company Ishir Infotech Ltd. was also excluded as comparable in the
case of M/s CSR India Pvt. Ltd.
3.9. Following the Coordinate Bench orders of the Tribunal in the case cited
supra, we direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude, after due verification,
those comparables from the list with the related party transactions or
controlled transactions in excess of 15% of the total revenue for the
financial year 2006-07. It is to be mentioned here, Geometric Ltd. is also to
be removed from the comparable list, since that company was having RPT at
19.98% (going by assessee's own calculation), however, no argument was raised
for its exclusion by the assessee, probably, on account of low margin of
Geometric Ltd."
> Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax
> & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  17/21 Regarding fourth
> substantial question of law:
"(f) Megasoft:
It is to be noted that in the case of Trilogy E-Business, the Tribunal turned
down the plea of the assessee that M/s. Megasoft Ltd should be rejected as
comparable. However, the Tribunal accepted the alternative submission of the
assessee that the segmental profit margin is to be reckoned with instead of
entity level margin and held that the profit margin of 23.11% which is the
margin of the software service segment be taken for comparability. The
discussion and the findings of the Bench with regard to the acceptance of the
alternative submission of the assessee to adopt the segmental margin of 23.11%
are reproduced below:
"xxxxx"
In conformity with the findings of the earlier Bench (supra), we are of the
considered view that the TPO was justified in selecting M/s.Megasoft Ltd as
comparable. However, the AO/TPO is directed to take segmental margins of
23.11% for comparability. It is ordered accordingly."
> Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax
> & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  18/21 Regarding fifth
> substantial question of law:
> "4.5. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the materials on
> record. We have noticed that the details of reimbursement expenses are given
> at page 334 of the paper book filed by the assessee. The break-up of the
> said expenses are not given in detail and it is not clear whether it is the
> reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the AE. Since the issue is
> not clear and there is no detailed discussion of the break-up of expenses,
> we deem it fit and proper to remit the issue to the file of the Assessing
> Officer/TPO for detailed verification. We make it clear that if the receipts
> are mere recovery of expenses without any service then the same should not
> be added back to the cost base for the purpose of mark-up. It is ordered
> accordingly."
11\. The controversy involved herein is no more res integra in view of the
decision of this Court in I.T.A.
Nos.536/2015 c/w 537/2015 dated 25.06.2018 [Prl.
Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr. V/s.
M/s.Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd.,], wherein it has been observed that unless the
finding of the Tribunal is found Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013
The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,
19/21 ex facie perverse, the Appeal u/s. 260-A of the Act, is not
maintainable. The relevant portion of the Judgment is quoted below for ready
reference:
> "Conclusion:
> 55\. A substantial quantum of international trade and transactions depends
> upon the fair and quick judicial dispensation in such cases. Had it been a
> case of substantial question of interpretation of provisions of Double
> Taxation Avoidance Treaties (DTAA), interpretation of provisions of the
> Income Tax Act or Overriding Effect of the Treaties over the Domestic

> Vodafone etc.), if based on relevant facts, such substantial questions of

> the Courts could have embarked upon such exercise of framing and answering
> such substantial question of law.
On the other hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the
comparables have Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA No.376/2013 The Commissioner
of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India Pvt. Ltd.,  20/21 been rightly
picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have
been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to
any substantial question of law.
56\. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed
by the Revenue do not give rise to any substantial question of law and the
suggested substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Section
260-A of the Act and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be
devoid of merit and the same are liable to be dismissed.
57\. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be
applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may
be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found
certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an 'Arm's Length
Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be
satisfied and have filed such appeals before Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA
No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India
Pvt. Ltd.,  21/21 this Court. Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction
with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a
sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
58\. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as
to costs."
12\. In the circumstances, having heard the learned Counsel appearing for both
the sides, we are of the considered opinion that no substantial question of
law arises for consideration in the present case.
13\. Hence, the Appeal filed by the Appellants-
Revenue is liable to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. No costs.

    i.] FORMULATE THE SUBSTANTIAL QUESTIONS OF LAW
57\. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be
applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may
be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found
certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an 'Arm's Length
Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be
satisfied and have filed such appeals before Date of Judgment 11-07-2018, ITA
No.376/2013 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. LG Soft India
Pvt. Ltd.,  21/21 this Court. Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction
with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a
sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
58\. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as
to costs."
12\. In the circumstances, having heard the learned Counsel appearing for both
the sides, we are of the considered opinion that no substantial question of
law arises for consideration in the present case.
13\. Hence, the Appeal filed by the Appellants-
