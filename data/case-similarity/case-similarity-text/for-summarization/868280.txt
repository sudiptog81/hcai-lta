JUDGMENT
1\. On an application filed under Section 256(1) of the IT Act, 1961, the
Tribunal has referred the following question for our opinion :
"Whether, on the facts, in totality of the circumstances and in view of
detailed explanations/clarifications, the learned Tribunal was right in law in
holding that remittances received by the assessee in convertible foreign
exchange from abroad as advertisement charges were not on account of sale
proceeds of any goods which are exported out of India and hence would not be
export turnover under Expln. (B) to Section 80HHC of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
2\. The other questions proposed in the application were rejected.
3\. Thereafter the petitioner has also moved an application under Section
256(2) of the IT Act, 1961, before us and raised the following questions :
1\. "Whether the learned Tribunal was right in law in holding that the action
by the CIT under Section 263 of the IT Act, 1961, is with jurisdiction ?"
2\. "Whether on the facts, in totality of the circumstances and in view of
detailed explanations/clarifications, the learned Tribunal was right in law in
25\. Mr. Ranka further argued that when two views are possible and if some
view has been taken by the AO, the CIT has no jurisdiction to initiate the
proceedings under Section 263 of the Act, 1961.
26\. We agree with Mr. Ranka that if two views are possible and if any
possible view has been taken by the AO, that should not be disturbed under
Section 263 of the Act, 1961. In our considered view the AO has gone
absolutely wrong in allowing the benefit of Section 80HHC on the amount
received against the advertisement from abroad. The wrong view which has been
taken by AO cannot be allowed to be perpetuated. Therefore, we find no force
in the submissions of Mr. Ranka.
27\. When two views are not possible and AO has gone absolutely wrong, the CIT
as well as the Tribunal have rightly directed the AO to withdraw the benefit
of Section 80HHC on the amount received against the advertisement from abroad,
no case is also made out for any direction to the Tribunal for referring the
questions proposed involved the same issue. The application under Section
256(2) of the Act is rejected.
detailed explanations/clarifications, the learned Tribunal was right in law in
holding that remittances received by the assessee in convertible foreign
exchange from abroad as advertisement charges were not on account of sale
proceeds of any goods which are exported out of India and hence would not be
export turnover under Expln. (B) to Section 80HHC of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
3\. "Whether the learned Tribunal was right in law in directing the AO to
recompute the deduction as per the decision of the Special Bench in the case
of International Research Park Laboratories Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT (1994) 50 TTJ
(Del)(SB) 661 : (1994) 50 ITD 37 (Del)(SB) ?"
4\. "Whether the learned Tribunal was right in law in holding that the CIT was
within his power to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 263 though the
CIT(A) had decided issue relating to deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act
before initiation of action under Section 263 of the Act ?"
As all the aforesaid questions are arising out of the same impugned order of
the Tribunal, we hear and dispose of the reference as well as reference
application under Section 256(2) of the Act by this common order.
4\. The assessee is a firm constituted in the month of September, 1990. The
business of the firm is publication of journal known as "Diamond World". The
relevant assessment years are 1991-92 and 1992-93. During these assessment
years, assessee received subscription from abroad against the supply of this
publication "Diamond World". The assessee also received substantial amount
against the advertisement published in this publication.
5\. This "Diamond World" is circulated in India as well as abroad. The
assessee claimed the benefit of s* 80HHC on the amount of subscription
received from abroad against this magazine/journal "Diamond World" and also
the amount received against advertisement given by foreigners for publication
in this journal. The AO allowed the benefit of Section 80HHC on both the
amounts.
6\. On scrutiny of assessment orders for 1991-92 and 1992-93, CIT found that
the order of the AO is erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of Revenue.
He issued the notice to the assessee to show-cause as to why the benefit of
Section 80HHC should not be withdrawn. After considering his submissions, CIT
has directed the AO to withdraw the benefit of Section 80HHC given to the
assessee on the amount received against advertisement which has been published
in the journal. Thereafter, assessee carried the matter before the Tribunal.
The Tribunal has also upheld the view taken by CIT under Section 263 of the IT
Act, 1961.
7\. Mr. Ranka, learned counsel for the assessee-petitioner submits that when
assessee received the amount against the advertisement in journal which is
circulated out of India and amount is also received from abroad, assessee is
entitled for deduction under Section 80HHC in respect of the amount received
from abroad against advertisement. He further submits that when two views are
possible CIT cannot set aside the order of AO under Section 263 of the IT Act,
1961. He also submits that Tribunal has confirmed the order of CIT on the
basis that it does not come under the definition of export turnover given in
Sub-section (4B) of Section 80HHC.
Mr. Ranka placed reliance on the decisions published in published in CIT v.
Trinity Hospital (1997) 225 TTR 178 (Raj), Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Customs 124 STC 59, Shri Dipak Dhar and Ors. v. State of West
Bengal and Anr. 61 STC 165, P.S. Apparels v. Dy. CTO 94 STC 139, Scientific
Engineering House (P) Ltd. (1986) 157 ITR 86 (SC) and State of Andhra Pradesh
v. National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. & Ors. 127 STC 280.
8\. Mr. Mathur, learned counsel for the Department submits that whatever the
goods the assessee exports in the form of journal, he got deduction under
Section 80HHC. He further submits that if any information or advertisement is
to be published at the instance of non-resident of India and any amount is
received from abroad, that amount does not come within the definition of
'goods' and CIT as well as the Tribunal has rightly disallowed that amount
under Section 80HHC of the Act.
9\. Mr. Mathur, learned counsel for the Department brought to our notice paras
8 and 9 of the CIT wherein he has dealt with the argument whether the assessee
is entitled for deduction under Section 80HHC. Paras 8 and 9 of the order of
the CIT reads as under:
"After due consideration it appears that the proposed action under Section 263
is well justified and the plea of the assessee referred to earlier is devoid
of any merit. It is no doubt true that relief under Section 80HHC is envisaged
with reference to export of goods/merchandise, of which the sale proceeds are
received in convertible foreign exchange. But it is farfetched to construe
advertisements as goods. Such an argument can hardly be accepted as logical. A
book in the form of journal published by the assessee may be considered as
'goods' but the question is, whether an advertisement published in the journal
which is sent outside, can be treated as supply of goods outside India ? The
assessee was doing the business of publishing a journal in India and in this
journal advertisements given by different persons living in India and outside
were being published. The advertisements obviously, were not free of cost, but
for a price consideration which, in common parlance is known as advertisement
charges. This would mean that the petitioner was in reality, rendering the
service of publishing the advertisements of different persons in its journal
and the persons giving such advertisements were paying advertisement charges
in lieu of advertisements so published. As per the common practice, a copy of
the journal has to be given to the advertiser so that he may know that his
advertisement has been duly published in the journal for which he was paying
advertisement charges. Thus, the copy of journal supplied to the advertiser is
mere voucher copy and solely for the purpose of collecting the advertisement
charges. By no stretch of imagination, it can be treated as supply of goods
though contended by the assessee. Even in commercial media like T.V., etc. the
advertisements of persons living outside India are displayed and for the
purpose of collecting the charges, necessary intimation in regard thereto is
given to the advertiser. The same, in general terms, is considered a service
rendered by the media to the advertiser for a monetary consideration and this
is what the assessee has done. So far as the remittance in convertible foreign
exchange, but it was in lieu of the advertisement so published in journal and
not in lieu of the supply of journal. The contention of the assessee of the
payment in convertible foreign exchange in lieu of supply of goods is
misconstrued inasmuch as firstly, there was no supply of goods or export
business done by the assessee who otherwise was engaged in publication of
journal, and, secondly the payment of convertible foreign exchange was in lieu
of the advertisement published, which constituted advertisement charges and
not in lieu of supply of any goods outside India."
"It may also be stated that whenever there is export of goods abroad, there
will be purchasers placing order for such goods and seller supplying the goods
in regard to sales abroad either independently or in lieu of orders received.
In the instant case, there was no iota of evidence to show any orders for
goods placed by a foreign buyer and it is only the advertisements given by the
parties outside India that otherwise appeared in the shape of an
advertisement, in the journal published by the assessee. Whatever book was
given by the assessee to the persons giving advertisements was only by way of
evidence to show that the advertisements charges were to be collected. It was
only a 'Voucher copy' as known in commercial circles and not supply of goods
so as to qualify for deduction under Section 80HHC. It was, in other words, a
short of service contract or service charges for the purpose of advertising in
the journal and in lieu of which the payments made by persons living outside
the country constituted the advertisement charges or the charges in lieu of
the service rendered in the form of giving advertisements in the journal. By
no stretch of imagination, the journal so given with a view to make the person
concerned aware of the advertisement having been published could have been
construed as supply of goods though contended by the assessee."
10\. The Tribunal has also considered the arguments of both the parties and
concluded its decision in paras 20, 21 and 22 of its order, which reads as
under:
"We have given our careful consideration to the rival contentions. The issue
as to whether assessee is engaged in the business of sale of goods and whether
the assessee by selling the Diamond World abroad is engaged in the export
business, need not be deliberated in view of the fact that CIT has not
withdrawn deduction under Section 80HHC absolutely. Assessee has receipts on
account of subscriptions and on account of advertisements. Insofar as the CIT
has not directed the AO to withdraw deduction under Section 80HHC in respect
of the subscription received from abroad, it is abundantly clear that it has
been accepted by the Revenue that assessee is also engaged in the business of
export of goods. The area of dispute before us is thus limited to the issue as
to whether the amount received by the assessee on account of advertisement
charged from abroad is includible as export turnover within meaning of Section
80HHC and whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the AO
was justified in allowing the claim of the assessee in full as claimed. In the
light of the above findings, it is not necessary for us to analyse the
decision cited on behalf of the assessee relating to the meaning of word
"goods". However, it is necessary to deal with the contention raised on behalf
of the assessee that the advertisement charges were received by the assessee
on account of composing, printing and sale thereof. The contention of the
learned counsel that the advertisement charges are for supply of the composed
and printed material and therefore, the receipts on account of advertisement
charges were on account of sale of goods does not appeal to us. Advertisement
charges are paid by the customers for inserting the advertisement in the
journal. The very fact that the customers pay substantial amounts as
advertisement charges when compared to the cost of printing goods very much
against the theory advanced before us that such charges are paid for
composing, printing and supply of printed copy of advertisement material. When
the cost of composing, printing and supply of printed material in considerably
low, a question raises as to why a customer would pay a high price to the
assessee for the said job. The answer to this query is abundantly clear
insofar as it is an open secret that the charges paid for advertisement by the
customers depend on the circulation of magazine and publication. More the
circulation of the magazine, the customer would be prepared to pay more as his
message will be received by more people. The real intention of the customer is
to get the benefit of circulation of the magazine by inserting the
advertisement in the magazine rather than getting the printing material at a
very high cost. As already pointed out if assessee were to get the printing
copy of advertisement material they would get the same at a very nominal
cost."
"The dictionary meaning of the word "Advertisement" is to give public
information and to draw attention or to offer for sale by public notice. The
act of asking anything by public notice amounts to advertisement. In our
considered view advertisement charges cannot be said to be on account of sale
of printed material for advertisement. However, we may hasten to add that the
charges paid by the customers for advertisement have a close nexus with the
sale of the magazine. The collection of advertisement charges are by reason of
the publication and circulation of the magazine and not by reason of quality
of the printed material. If there is no sale of the magazine, there would be
no willing customers to insert advertisements in the magazine. The more the
circulation and popularity of the magazine, there will be a greater demand for
insertion of advertisement and the charges would also depend mostly on the
popularity of the magazine. We have, therefore, no doubt in our mind that
advertisement charges are incidental and ancillary to the export of the
magazine. The charges received by the assessee would largely contribute to
meet the cost of the publication. A perusal of the P&L a/c reveals that but
for advertisement charges assessee would have suffered heavy losses. The cost
of publication is met by the assessee mostly by receiving advertisement
charges from abroad as well as from Indian customers. Thus ordinarily the
advertisement charges received from abroad would form part of export profits.
But from asst. yr. 1991-92 Section 80HHC has been amended. Export turnover has
also been defined. The assessee's case is a case where they are engaged in the
business of exports and also deriving income from other than exports. In such
cases, export profits from purposes of allowance of deduction under Section
80HHC is to be committed as per the following formula :
Export profit = Total profits x Export turnover/Total turnover"
"We have gone through the certificate issued by the chartered accountant, in
respect of asst. yrs. 1991-92 and 1992-93 and find that in computing the
export turnover the definition as per the Explanation after Section 80HHC(4A)
has been ignored, the learned chartered accountant has misunderstood.
Explanation (b) to Section 80HHC reads as under : "Export turnover" means the
sale proceeds received in, or brought into India by the assessee in
convertible foreign exchange in accordance with Clause (a) of Sub-section (2)
of any goods of merchandise to which this section applies and which are
exported out of India, but does not include freight or insurance attributable
to the transport of the goods or merchandise beyond the customs station as
defined in the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962)."
11\. The CIT as well as Tribunal both found that this amount does not come
under the definition of 'export turnover'.
12\. Before we answer the question, we would like to refer some decisions of
the Supreme Court and High Courts relied by Mr. Ranka.
13\. In CIT v. Trinity Hospital (supra), the issue before this Court was
whether the x-ray machines, ultrasound scanner manufacture or produce any
thing. This Court has taken the view that they manufacture and produce the
goods, therefore, they are entitled for investment allowance under Section 32A
of the Act, 1961.
14\. In the case of Bajaj Tempo Ltd. v. CIT (1992) 196 ITR 188 (SC), there was
no dispute before their Lordships whether a particular activity comes under
the definition of 'goods' or not. Therefore, this case has no relevancy.
15\. In the case of Scientific Engineering House (P) Ltd. v. CIT (supra) the
issue before their Lordships is whether books constitute plant for the purpose
of Section 43(3) of IT Act, 1961. Their Lordships on this issue held that it
constitutes plant.
16\. In the case of Shri Dipak Dhar and Ors. v. State of West Bengal and Anr.
(supra), the issue involved before us has not been considered. Therefore, this
has also no relevancy.
17\. In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh v. National Thermal Power
Corporation Ltd. and Ors. (supra), their Lordships have considered whether
electric energy be treated as goods. Their Lordships held that electric energy
has been covered by the definition of "goods" in Article 366(12) of the
Constitution of India.
18\. In the case of Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Commissioner of
Customs (supra), their Lordships have considered the meaning of "goods". The
technological advice or information put on media like paper, book or diskette
are goods. The definition of "goods" has been given in Section 2(22) of the
Customs Act, 1962 and as per that definition those were treated as goods.
Whether a particular article or thing is "good", if it has been given in the
definition, the Court has to go by that definition and not by the general
meaning thereof.
19\. In the case of P.S. Apparels v. Dy. CTO (supra), the issue before the
Madras High Court is whether sale of licence is sale of goods. The Madras High
Court has taken the view that the transaction attracts sales-tax.
20\. The facts are not in dispute that in asst. yrs. 1991-92 and 1992-93, the
assessee has received some amount against the subscription and advertisement.
The details thereof is as follows :
Asst. yr. 1991-92 Subscription (Rs.) Advertisement (Rs.) Indian 9,150 1,36,243
Foreign 12,386 4,49,797 Asst. yr. 1992-93 Indian 52,221 10,17,992 Foreign
43,824 15,55,742
21\. Sub-clause (1) of Section 80HHC provides that where the assessee being an
Indian company or a person resident in India is engaged in the business of
'export out of India of any goods or merchandise' to which this section
applies, there shall be a deduction in computing the total income of the
assessee to the extent of profit referred to in Sub-section (1B) derived by
the assessee from the export of such goods or merchandise. The details of
percentage of deduction of benefit has been given in Sub-section (1A). The
benefit has been given on the basis of export turnover which has been defined
in Clause (b) of Explanation to Section (4B) of the Act which reads as under:
"Export turnover" means the sale proceeds received in, or brought into, India
by the assessee in convertible foreign exchange in accordance with Clause (a)
of Sub-section (2) of any goods or merchandise to which this section applies
and which are exported out of India, but does not include freight or insurance
attributable to the transport of the goods or merchandise beyond the customs
station as defined in the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962);"
22\. In the various provisions of Section 80HHC, in each sub-section, the word
on export of goods and merchandise has been used. At no stretch of
imagination, the subscription against the advertisement can be treated as the
receipt against the export of goods nor it is covered by the definition of
'export turnover' on which the benefit of Section 80HHC can be computed.
23\. In our view, the AO has gone absolutely wrong in allowing the deduction
under Section 80HHC on the amount received from foreign against the
advertisement which has been given in the journal "Diamond World".
Mr. Mathur also brought to our notice the decision of their Lordships in the
case of Rainbow Colour Lab and Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. 118
STC 9 (SC). In this case, the issue before their Lordships was whether taking
photographs, developing, the negative films and supplying prints attracts the
provisions of Sales-tax Act, 1956. Their Lordships before para 14 observed as
under :
"Thus, it is clear that unless there is sale and purchase of goods, either in
fact or deemed, and which sale is primarily intended and not incidental to the
contract, the State cannot impose sales-tax on a works contract simpliciter in
the guise of the expanded definition found in Article 366(29A)(b) r/w Section
2(n) of the State Act. On facts as we have noticed that the work done by the
photographer which, as held by this Court in Kame's case (1977) 39 STC 237
(SC), is only in the nature of a service contract not involving any sale of
goods, we are of the opinion that the stand taken by the respondent-State
cannot be sustained."
24\. As we have considered the cases referred by Mr. Ranka in earlier paras,
the cases referred are of no help to the assessee. Those cases relate to the
issue whether there were activities of manufacturing of goods. In no case, the
amount received against the advertisement has been treated the amount against
the export of goods. For benefit of Section 80HHC, the section contemplates
that there should be an export of goods by the assessee. It is true, there was
an export of magazine "Diamond World" but against that, the assessee has
received the amount in form of subscription and for the amount of
subscription, the deduction under Section 80HHC has been allowed by the AO and
has not been disturbed by the CIT and Tribunal. The amount received against
that advertisement in that magazine at no stretch of imagination can be
treated the amount received against the 'export of goods'.
25\. Mr. Ranka further argued that when two views are possible and if some
view has been taken by the AO, the CIT has no jurisdiction to initiate the
proceedings under Section 263 of the Act, 1961.
26\. We agree with Mr. Ranka that if two views are possible and if any
possible view has been taken by the AO, that should not be disturbed under
Section 263 of the Act, 1961. In our considered view the AO has gone
absolutely wrong in allowing the benefit of Section 80HHC on the amount
received against the advertisement from abroad. The wrong view which has been
taken by AO cannot be allowed to be perpetuated. Therefore, we find no force
in the submissions of Mr. Ranka.
27\. When two views are not possible and AO has gone absolutely wrong, the CIT
as well as the Tribunal have rightly directed the AO to withdraw the benefit
of Section 80HHC on the amount received against the advertisement from abroad,
no case is also made out for any direction to the Tribunal for referring the
questions proposed involved the same issue. The application under Section
256(2) of the Act is rejected.
28\. We also answer the question referred by the Tribunal in affirmative i.e.,
in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
In the result, both the reference application and reference petition stands
disposed of accordingly.
25\. Mr. Ranka further argued that when two views are possible and if some
view has been taken by the AO, the CIT has no jurisdiction to initiate the
proceedings under Section 263 of the Act, 1961.
26\. We agree with Mr. Ranka that if two views are possible and if any

absolutely wrong in allowing the benefit of Section 80HHC on the amount

detailed explanations/clarifications, the learned Tribunal was right in law in
holding that remittances received by the assessee in convertible foreign
exchange from abroad as advertisement charges were not on account of sale
proceeds of any goods which are exported out of India and hence would not be
export turnover under Expln. (B) to Section 80HHC of the IT Act, 1961 ?"

the Tribunal, we hear and dispose of the reference as well as reference

received from abroad against this magazine/journal "Diamond World" and also
the amount received against advertisement given by foreigners for publication

26\. We agree with Mr. Ranka that if two views are possible and if any
possible view has been taken by the AO, that should not be disturbed under
Section 263 of the Act, 1961. In our considered view the AO has gone
absolutely wrong in allowing the benefit of Section 80HHC on the amount
received against the advertisement from abroad. The wrong view which has been
taken by AO cannot be allowed to be perpetuated. Therefore, we find no force
in the submissions of Mr. Ranka.

as well as the Tribunal have rightly directed the AO to withdraw the benefit
of Section 80HHC on the amount received against the advertisement from abroad,
no case is also made out for any direction to the Tribunal for referring the
questions proposed involved the same issue. The application under Section
256(2) of the Act is rejected.

within his power to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 263 though the
CIT(A) had decided issue relating to deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act
before initiation of action under Section 263 of the Act ?"
As all the aforesaid questions are arising out of the same impugned order of
the Tribunal, we hear and dispose of the reference as well as reference
application under Section 256(2) of the Act by this common order.
