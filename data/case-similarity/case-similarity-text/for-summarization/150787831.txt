    Assessee By : Shri Shyam Ramadhyani,C.A.

the Assessing Officer and further the apportionment of the expenditure between
10A  49 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 and non-10A units is
also required to be examined and verified.
Therefore the claim of the assessee has to be apportioned between units
eligible under Section 10A and the units which is not eligible for the
deduction under Section 10A and then it has to be allowed against the
respective income of the separate units. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, we set aside this issue to the record of the
Assessing Officer for a limited purpose of verification and examination of the
relevant record regarding apportionment of the amount between the 10A unit and
non-10A unit.
24\. In the result, the cross appeals for the A.Y. 2005-06 as well as the
appeal of the assessee for the A.Y. 2007-08 AE partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on the 31st day of Oct., 2016.

Per Shri Vijay Pal Rao, J.M. :
These cross appeals for the Assessment Year 2005-06 are directed against the
order dt.9.11.2011 of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-
IV, Bangalore and the assessee has filed an appeal for the Assessment  2
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 Year 2007-08 against the
assessment order dt.26.9.2011 passe under Section 143(3) r.w.s. 144C of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short 'the Act') in pursuant to the directions of the
Dispute Resolution Panel (in short 'DRP') dt.;13.9.2011.
2\. First we take up the assessee's appeal for the Assessment Year 2005-06
wherein the assessee has raised the following grounds :
"1. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that the price charged by it to its associated
enterprises satisfied the arms length test envisaged in Chapter X of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act) and that no additions were required.
2\. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that it is a captive software development unit of
its parent company and that there were differences in functions performed,
assets employed and risks assumed as compared to independent software services
companies and adjustments were required to take into account such differences.
3\. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that the rates of depreciation on fixed assts
adopted by it were higher than those followed by comparable companies and that
adjustments were required to the cost base adopted while determining the arms
length price.
4 On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that the hourly billing rates charged by it to its
associated enterprise were comparable to that charged by certain software
companies and on this ground alone, ought to have accepted that the fees  3
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 charged by it to its associated
enterprise satisfied the arms length test envisaged in Chapter X of the Act
and that no additions were required.
5 On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not allowing necessary
deduction of 5% in term of proviso to section 92C(2) of the Act."
The assessee is engaged in providing of chip designs and development services
to M/s. Microchip Technologies Inc., USA and marketing support services to
M/s. Microchip, Netherlands. The assessee is reimbursed at cost plus 12% in
respect of software development services and cost plus 10% in respect of
market support services. The dispute before us is only with respect to the
software development services provided to the parent company at USA. The TPO
has selected 17 comparable companies for determining the Arm's Length Price
('ALP') :
4
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
3\. After allowing the working capital adjustment of 1.15% the adjusted
average PLI was computed at 25.44%. Accordingly, the TPO proposed an upward
adjustment under Section 92CA of Rs.82,26,807. The assessee challenged the
action of the TPO before the CIT (Appeals) however the CIT (Appeals) has
confirmed the action of the TPO.
3.1 Before us, the learned Authorised Representative of the assessee has
submitted that the assessee's turn over is less than Rs.7 Crores which is not
in dispute therefore even if the comparable companies having  5 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 more than 10 times turnover of the
assessee are consideration for turnover filter then the companies selected by
the TPO at Sl. Nos.8 to 17 will be excluded by applying the turnover filter of
10 times. In support of his contention, he has relied upon the decision
dt.31.03.2016 of this Tribunal in the case of Income Tax Officer Vs. M/s.
Maxim India Integrated Circuit Design Pvt. Ltd. in IT(TP)A No.28/Bang/2012.
4\. On the other hand, the ld. DR has relied upon the orders of the
authorities below and submitted that when this issue of turnover filter of 10
times of the assessee's turnover was not raised before the authorities below
then this cannot be raised at this stage.
5\. We have considered the rival submissions and relevant material on record.
It is pertinent to note that the TPO has applied turnover slab of Rs.1 crore
to Rs.200 crores for excluding some of the companies, whereas there is an
inherent difficulty in applying such a turnover slab of Rs.1 crore to Rs.200
crores because the said classification on the basis of slab of the turnover
gives unrealistic results, as an entity having Rs.1 crore turnover can be
compared with any entity having Rs.200 crores turnover, but at the same time
an entity having Rs.200 crores turnover cannot be compared with an entity
having Rs.201 crores turnover. Thus,  6 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 &
40/Bang/2012 as it is clear from the above illustration that it gives
ambiguous result as two entities having difference of Rs.1 crore cannot be
considered as comparable, whereas on the other hand difference of Rs.199
crores can be considered as comparable company. Therefore, such classification
of comparables on the basis of Rs.1 Crore to Rs.200 Crores of turnover is not
appropriate and acceptable. The turnover, no doubt, is a relevant factor to be
taken into account, but there should be some proper and reasonable parameter
to apply the difference of turnover between the assessee and the comparable
which may be a reasonable multiple. This Tribunal in case of ITO Vs. Maxim
India Integrated Circuit Design Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) has taken a similar view as under. Accordingly, by applying the
turnover filter of 10 times to the turnover of the assessee's on both sides
the following 10 companies are directed to be excluded from the set of
comparables as not satisfying the turnover filter of 10 times of the turnover
of the assessee.
            Sl. No.                    Name of Company
               1.     R S Software (India) Ltd.
               2.     Geometric Software Solutions Co. Ltd.
               3.     Tata Elxsi Ltd. (Seg.)
               4.     Visual Soft Technologies Ltd. (Seg.)
               5.     Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. (Seg.)
               6.     iGate Global Solutions
                                            7
                                                      IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 &
                                                                 34 & 40/Bang/2012
               7.     Flextronics (Seg.)
               8.     L&T Infotech Ltd.
               9.     Satyam
              10.     Infosys
6\. The assessee has also sought exclusion of 5 more companies namely (i)
Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., (ii) Exensys Software Solutions Ltd.,
(iii) Sankhya Infotech Ltd., (iv) Four Soft Ltd. and (v) Thirdware Solutions
Ltd. on functional dissimilarity.
7\. We have heard the learned A.R. as well as learned D.R. and considered the
relevant material on record. The ld. AR has relied upon the decision
dt.18.3.2016 of the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of McAfee
Software India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ITO dt.18.3.2016 in IT(TP)A No.1388/Bang/2011 and
submitted that all these five companies were considered by the co-ordinate
bench and found that these are not functionally comparable with the software
development services provider like the assessee.
8\. On the other hand, the ld. DR has relied upon the orders of the
authorities below.
8
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
9\. Having considered the rival submissions, we note that the co-
ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Mc Afee Software India Pvt.
Ltd. Vs. ITO (supra) has considered the functional comparability of the five
companies as under :
" Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.,:
10.3. This company was retained by Ld.CIT(A) but Assessee objects on the basis
of functionality. However, as seen from the orders of Co-ordinate Benches in
the case of ITO Vs. M/s. Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private Limited,
in IT(TP)A No. 1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06-2015 (supra) as well as DCIT Vs.
Toshiba embedded Software (I) Pvt. Ltd., in IT(TP)A No. 1/Bang/2012 dt.
10-05-2013, Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., was accepted as a comparable. However,
in the case of Cordys Software India P. Ltd., in ITA No. 1451/Hyd/2010 dt.
13-06-2014 (Where one of us, AM is the author) has considered in detail and
excluded the same for the following reasons: "1. Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.
The learned counsel submitted that this company should be rejected under the
following TPO's filters:
• Related party transactions filter: As per schedule 4 of the balance sheet,
the company has investments in Perigon, LIC, USA and as per the response u/s
133(6); the company has export sales to Perigon LIC, USA of Rs. 133.90 lakhs,
being 34.68% of the total turnover.
• Functionally different filter: The company in its response to notice u/s
133(6) has stated that it provides e-paper solutions, data cleansing software,
website development and other customized software and also state that the
e-paper solutions and data cleansing services would come under the category of
IT enabled services".
IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011 Considering the above, we direct
that the above company has to be excluded on the reason of RPT of more than
25% and functionality. Lanco Global Systems Ltd., :
10.4. This company even though included by TPO and has not been objected to by
Assessee, was rejected by the CIT(A) on the reason of low profit margin. This
is not a valid ground. Only continuous loss making companies are being
excluded from the comparability. If this argument was accepted, the high
profit making companies are also to be excluded. This is not the purpose for
which TP analysis is being undertaken. Therefore, keeping the principles laid
down by the Special Bench of ITAT in the case of Maersk Global Centers  9
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 (India) P.Ltd 43 Taxmann.com
100 Mumbai(SB), we, consider the same as comparable and retain it in the list.
Sankhya Infotech Ltd., Thirdware Solution Ltd., & Tata Elxsi Ltd., : 10.5.
These three companies are rejected as comparables on functionality in the case
of ITO Vs. M/s. Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private Limited, in
IT(TP)A No. 1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06- 2015 (supra) (paras 19- 20, 22-26, 27-30
restively) and in the case of Cordys Software India P. Ltd., in ITA No.
1451/Hyd/2010 dt. 13-06-2014 (supra) at Para No. 13. The analysis by the Co-
ordinate Benches is as under:
IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011 "Sankhya Infotech Limited
('Sankhya')
19\. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the Assessee that Sankhya is
engaged in the business of development of software products & services and
training. The company focuses on the development of niche products for the
transport and aviation industry. However, segmental information in relation to
the above mentioned activities is not available in public domain. Therefore,
as Sankhya engages itself in products and services as well as software
training, it cannot be considered as a comparable of the Appellant. The
products developed and owned by Sankhya are listed below:
(1) SILICONTM Training Suite of Products: The products are a comprehensive
enterprise wide training platform that covers the entire spectrum of training
in a paperless environment. It comprises of four products:-
\- SILICONTM LMS (Training Management Information
\- SILICONTM QT (Online Assessment System)
\- SILICONTM LCMS (Learning Content Management System)
\- IRMAQTM : This is an integrated resource planning, management tracking
system exclusively developed for Airline operations. It is an end-to-end
solution for all Flight Operations.
\- Sakai CLE : This is a widely used and popular open source LMS used in many
leading educational institutions and corporate. The relevant extract from the
Annual report substantiating that the company also engages in different
activities is reproduced below:
"2. Activities The company as engaged in the business of development of
Software Products & Services and training. The production of software is not
capable of being expressed in any generic unit and hence 11 is riot possible
to give the information as required by certain clauses of paragraphs 3.4C and
4 D of Part II of Schedule VI of the Companies Act, 1956."
10
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 The Delhi Tribunal in ITO v.
Colt Technology Services India Pvt. Ltd. (judgment dated 23.10.2012 in ITA No.
609I/Del/2011 for the assessment year 2005-06) has held that the said company
is not a comparable to the Assessee therein which was also in the business of
software development.
IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011
20\. The submissions made by the learned counsel for the Assessee are
considered. The activities set out above and the decision of the Delhi ITAT
rendered in the context of a software development company such as the Assessee
makes it amply clear that this company Sankhya cannot be regarded as a
comparable. The same is directed to be excluded from the list of comparable
companies.
22\. We have considered his submission and find that the ITAT Hyderabad Bench
on identical facts, held that the aforesaid two companies viz., Four Soft
Ltd., and Thirdware Solutions Ltd., are not comparable companies in Software
Development Services companies. The following were the relevant observations:-
"15.4. FOURSOFT LIMITED : This comparable is objected on the same reason as
this company is involved in product development and owns products namely 4S
eTrans and 4S eLog. These products are used in Sun Microsystems Inc, in an
Application Verification Kit Certified for Enterprises and Assessee have been
investing continuously on product developments. Since Assessee is in the
product development, having I.P. rights, the same is not comparable. 15.5.
THIRDWARE SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS LIMITED :
This company is objected to by the Assessee on the reason that the said
Thirdware Software Solutions Ltd. is engaged in sale of software licence and
related services and not a service provider. Referring to the annual report,
it was submitted that this comparable was rejected by the ITAT, Pune in the
case of Egain Communications Ltd. This company having revenue from product
license and earning extraordinary profit due to intangible owns. 15.6. These
three comparable above Flextronics Software Limited, Foursoft Limited and
Thirdware Software Solution Limited were analysed by the Coordinate Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of Intoto Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
wherein it has been held as under :
"23. The other companies which are objected to by the Assessee are Flextronics
Software Limited, Foursoft Limited and Thirdware Software Solution Limited. As
far as these three companies are concerned, the learned Counsel appearing on
behalf of the Assessee submitted that they are into both software as well as
product development. He submitted that the TPO has taken note of the fact
these companies are also into product development but has selected these
companies as comparables by applying the filter of more than 70% of its
revenue being from software development services. The learned Counsel
submitted that the functions of these companies are different from the
Assessee who was into sole activity of software development for its associated
enterprise. He submitted that the TPO has allocated  11 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 the expenditure in the proportion of
the revenue of these IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011 companies from
software services and software products and has adopted the figure as
segmental margin of the company and has taken these companies as comparables.
He submitted that by taking the proportionate expenditure, the correct
financial results would not emerge. He submitted that nothing prevented the
Assessing Officer/TPO from obtaining the segmental details from the respective
comparable companies before adopting them as comparable companies and before
taking the operating margin for arriving at the arms length price. He
submitted that wherever the segmental details are not available, then the said
companies should not be taken as comparables. For this purpose, he placed
reliance upon the decision of the Bangalore Tribunal in the case of First
Advantage Offshore Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. The DCIT in ITA.No.1252/Bang/2010
wherein these companies were directed to be excluded from the list of
comparables.
23\. The learned D.R. however, supported the Orders of the authorities below.
24\. Having heard both the parties and having gone through the material on
record, we find that the TPO at page 37of his order has brought out the
differences between a product company and a software development services
provider. Thus, it is clear that he is aware of the functional dissimilarity
between a product company and a software development service provider. Having
taken note of the difference between the two functions, the Assessing Officer
ought not to have taken the companies which are into both the product
development as well as software development service provider as comparables
unless the segmental details are available. Even if he has adopted the filter
of more than 75% of the revenue from the software services for selecting a
comparable company, he ought to have taken the segmental results of the
software services only. The percentage of expenditure towards the development
of software products may differ from company to company and also it may not be
proportionate to the sales from the sale of software products. Under section
133(6) of the I.T. Act, the TPO has the power to call for the necessary
details from the comparable companies. It is seen that the Assessing
Officer/TPO as exercised this power to call for details with regard to the
various companies. As seen from the annual report of Foursoft Limited which is
reproduced at page 7 of the TPO's Order, the said company has derived income
from software licence also and AMCs.
25\. As far as Thirdware Software Solution Limited is concerned, we find from
the information furnished by the said company that though the said company is
also into product development, there are no software products that the company
invoiced during the relevant financial year and the financial results are in
respect of services only. Thus, it is clear that there is no sale of software
products during the year but the said company might have incurred expenditure
towards the development of the software products.
IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011  12 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34
& 40/Bang/2012
26\. As far as Flextronics Software Limited is concerned, we find that at page
90 of his Order, the TPO has also observed that the said company has incurred
expenditure for selling of products and has incurred R & D expenditure for
development of the products. The above facts clearly demonstrate that there is
functional dissimilarity between the Assessee and these companies and without
making adjustment for the dissimilarities brought out by the TPO himself,
these companies cannot be taken as comparable companies. The method adopted by
the TPO to allocate expenditure proportionately to the software development
services and software product activity cannot be said to be correct and
reasonable. Wherever, the Assessing Officer/TPO cannot make suitable
adjustment to the financial results of the comparable companies with the
Assessee company to bring them on par with the Assessee, these companies are
to be excluded from the list of comparables. Therefore, we direct the
Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude these three companies from the list of
comparables.
27\. The learned counsel for the Assessee submitted before us that TATA Elxsi
Ltd., a comparable company out of the 10 excluded by the CIT(A) by applying
RPT filter and which gets included in the comparable companies because of 15%
RPT being adopted as threshold limit for excluding companies for the purpose
of comparability. It was his submission that this company will however, have
to be excluded as this company was held to be not comparable with an Assessee
such as the Assessee in the present case providing software development
services by the ITAT Hyderabad Bench in the case of CNO IT Services (India)
Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly known as Conseco Data Services (India) Pvt. Ltd.)
Hyderabad vs. DCIT, Circle 1(2) Hyderabad, in ITA.No.1280/Hyd/2010 Assessment
Year 2005- 2006 order dated 12.2.2014.
28\. We have considered his submission and find that the ITAT Hyderabad Bench
on identical facts, held on comparability of TATA Elxsi Ltd. as follows:
"15.7. TATA ELXSI LIMITED : The objection of the Assessee is that TATA Elxsi
operating two segments -system communication services and software development
services. The TPO accepted the software development services segment in his
T.P. analysis and Assessee's objection is that the software development
services segment itself comprises of three subservices namely (a) product
design services (b)design engineering services and (c) visual computing labs.
It was submitted that these services are not akin to Assessee software
services and segmental information of only product design services could have
been accepted by the TPO as a comparable but not the entire software
development service. Since company's operations are functionally different as
such, the same is not comparable. Further, Assessee is also objecting on the
basis of intangible scale of operations. The coordinate bench in the case of
Intoto (supra) considered the issue as under in para 22:
"22 Tata Elxsi Limited : As regards this company, the learned Counsel
appearing on behalf of the Assessee, filed before us the reply of Tata Elxsi
Limited to the Addl. CIT (Transfer Pricing), Hyderabad, wherein the concerned
IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 13 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
1388/Bang/2011 Officer has been informed that Tata Elxsi Limited is
specialised Embedded Software Development Service Provider and that it cannot
be compared with any other software development company. It was submitted that
because of the specialisation and also because of diverse nature of its
business, it is very difficult to scale-up the operations of Tata Elxsi
Limited. In view of this, Tata Elxsi Limited has informed that it is not fair
to use its financial numbers to compare it with any other company. The
communication dated 25th August, 2009 to the TPO is placed before us. As this
communication was not before the TPO at the time of transfer pricing
adjustment we deem it fit and proper to remand this issue also to the file of
the TPO to reconsider adopting this company as the comparable in the light of
observations of this company to the TPO in the case of another Assessee. In
the result, the Assessing Officer/TPO is directed to reconsider the issue in
accordance with law, after affording a reasonable opportunity of being heard
to the Assessee."
Keeping the Assessee's objections and the decisions of the Coordinate Bench,
prima facie, we are of the view that TATA Elxsi Limited is functionally
different and has incomparable size to that of the Assessee. Further, we are
unable to verify whether the segmental profits adopted by the TPO pertain to
entire software development services or pertain to limited service akin to
Assessee services. Since, these aspects are not clear from the data furnished
before us, we direct the TPO to examine and in case, the segmental profits of
a particular service is not available, then, to exclude the TATA Elxsi Limited
from the list of comparables. Accordingly, this issue is restored to the file
of TPO for examination and to decide in accordance with law and facts, after
affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to Assessee."
29\. Though the issue has been set aside to the AO in the aforesaid decision,
the ITAT Hyderabad in the case of NTT Data India Enterprise Application
Services Pvt.Ltd., ITA No.1612/Hyd/2010 order dated 23.10.2013 and in a
subsequent ruling in the case of Invensys Development Centre (India) Pvt.Ltd.,
ITA No.1256/Hyd/2010 order dated 28.2.2014, held that TATA Elxsi is not
functionally comparable with that of a software development service provider
such as the Assessee.
30\. In view of the aforesaid decision rendered on identical facts and
circumstances, we are of the view that TATA Elxsi Ltd., should be excluded
from the list of comparable companies.
"13. Similarly, the other cases, Bodhtree consulting Ltd, Four Soft Ltd,
Infosys,., Sankhya Infotech Ltd., Thirdware Solutions Ltd, Tata Elexi (seg)
etc, are also to be excluded as they are considered and analysed in various
cases relied on about functionality and why the same are not comparable to the
companies like Assessee. Bodhtree consulting Ltd also fails RPT filter as
contended. In view of this, we are not IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 &
1388/Bang/2011 discussing above comparables in detail, but, suffice to say
that Assessee's submissions are valid. The AO is directed to exclude the above
comparables and re- work out the arm's length margin accordingly. The  14
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 ground No.8 and additional
ground raised by Assessee are considered as allowed".
In view of the above, the above three companies are to be excluded. Sasken
Network Systems Ltd., R S Software (India) Ltd., Visualsoft Technologies Ltd.,
and Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd., 10.6 Since there is no objection
from Assessee and was selected by TPO, the above companies are retained.
Four Soft Ltd., 10.7. The objection by Assessee is that this company is a
product company. was analysed and accepted in the case of ITO Vs. M/s.
Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private Limited, in IT(TP)A No.
1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06-2015 (supra) para 22. It was held that the said
company ahs derived income from software license and AMCs. Since functionality
was already analysed, respectfully following the Co-ordinate Benches also, the
same was to be excluded.
i. Intoto Software India Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 1196/Hyd/2010; ii. Cordys Software
India P. Ltd., ITA No. 1451/Hyd/2010 IT(TP)A Nos. 04/Bang/2012 &
1388/Bang/2011 Geometric Software Solutions Company Ltd.,:
10.8. Even though this company was accepted as comparable in ITO Vs. M/s.
Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private Limited, in IT(TP)A No.
1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06-2015 (supra) and Cordys Software India P. Ltd., in
ITA No. 1451/Hyd/2010 dt. 13-06-2014 (supra) and was not objected to, we find
that the Co-ordinate Bench at Banalore in the case of DCIT Vs. Toshiba
embedded Software (I) Pvt. Ltd., in IT(TP)A No. 1/Bang/2012 dt. 10-05-2013 has
considered that this is in product devolopement. We have perused the TPO's
order. In page 85 and 86 of the order, this comparable was analysed. TPO
records that there are product sales to the extent of 18%. Segmental profits
are not available. On assumptions, this company was retained. We are of the
opinion that being a product based company, the same is not strictly
comparable to a service company like Assessee. In the absence of segmental
profit of service income, we have to exclude the same. Following the decision
in the case of DCIT Vs. Toshiba embedded Software (I) Pvt. Ltd., in IT(TP)A
No. 1/Bang/2012 dt. 10-05-2013 (supra), this company is accordingly excluded.
Igate Global Solutions Ltd., & L&T Infotech:
10.9. These two companies are found comparable in many orders of the Co-
ordinate Benches, but excluded on the basis of turnover filter of Rs. 200
Crores limit in ITO Vs. M/s. Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private
Limited, in IT(TP)A No. 1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06-2015 (supra), we have IT(TP)A
Nos. 04/Bang/2012 & 1388/Bang/2011 considered the same. Assessee's turnover is
about 63 Crores. The turnover of Igate Global Solutions Ltd., (Seg) is about
405 crores and L & T Infotech Ltd is of 562 Crores. This is with the range of
ten times the upper limit. Moreover, Assessee Counsel has not pressed on
turnover  15 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 filter of Rs. 200
Crores. Therefore, these two are retained. Flextronics Software Systems Ltd.,:
10.10. This company was objected to on functional dissimilarity. This was
considered in ITO Vs. M/s. Sunquest Information Systems (India) Private
Limited, in IT(TP)A No. 1302/Bang/2011 dt. 11-06-2015 (supra) as under:
"26. As far as Flextronics Software Limited is concerned, we find that at page
90 of his Order, the TPO has also observed that the said company has incurred
expenditure for selling of products and has incurred R & D expenditure for
development of the products. The above facts clearly demonstrate that there is
functional dissimilarity between the Assessee and these companies and without
making adjustment for the dissimilarities brought out by the TPO himself,
these companies cannot be taken as comparable companies. The method adopted by
the TPO to allocate expenditure proportionately to the software development
services and software product activity cannot be said to be correct and
reasonable. Wherever, the Assessing Officer/TPO cannot make suitable
adjustment to the financial results of the comparable companies with the
Assessee company to bring them on par with the Assessee, these companies are
to be excluded from the list of comparables. Therefore, we direct the
Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude these three companies from the list of
comparables". Respectfully following, we exclude the same."
By following the order of the co-ordinate bench, we direct the A.O./TPO to
exclude these five companies namely (i) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., (ii) Exensys
Software Solutions Ltd., (iii) Sankhya Infotech Ltd., (iv) Four Soft Ltd. and
(v) Thirdware Solutions Ltd. After exclusion of 10 companies on the ground of
having turnover more than 10 times than the assessee and 5 companies as
functionally not comparable only two companies are left which are as under :
i) Lanco Global Systems Ltd.
ii) Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd. (Seg.) Accordingly, the TPO/A.O. is
directed to recomputed the ALP by considering the benefit as per the proviso
to section 92C.

IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
10\. The revenue in the cross appeal has raised only the issue regarding
exclusion of expenses from the export turnover as well as total turnover while
computing the deduction under Section 10A of the Act.
10.1 We have heard the rival submission and perused the material on record.
The Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the case of CIT v M/s Tata Elxsi Ltd. &
Others 349 ITR 98 (Kar) had held that while computing the exemption u/s 10A,
if the export turnover in the numerator is to be arrived at after excluding
certain expenses, the same should also be excluded from the total turnover in
the denominator. The relevant finding of the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court
reads as follows:-
> "...........Section 10A is enacted as an incentive to exporters to enable
> their products to be competitive in the global market and consequently earn
> precious foreign exchange for the country. This aspect has to be borne in
> mind. While computing the consideration received from such export turnover,
> the expenses incurred towards freight, telecommunication charges, or
> insurance attributable to the delivery of the articles or things or computer
> software outside India, or expenses if any incurred in foreign exchange, in
> providing the technical services outside India should not be included.
> However, the word total turnover is not defined for the purpose of this
> section. It is because of this omission to define 'total turnover', the word
> 'total turnover' falls for interpretation by this Court;
........In section 10A, not only the word 'total turnover' is not defined,
there is no clue regarding what is to be excluded while arriving at the total
turnover.
17
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 However, while interpreting the
provisions of section 80HHC, the courts have laid down various principles,
which are independent of the statutory provisions. There should be uniformity
in the ingredients of both the numerator and the denominator of the formula,
since otherwise it would produce anomalies or absurd results. Section 10A is a
beneficial section which intends to provide incentives to promote exports. In
the case of combined business of an assessee, having export business and
domestic business, the legislature intended to have a formula to ascertain the
profits from export business by apportioning the total profits of the business
on the basis of turnovers. Apportionment of profits on the basis of turnover
was accepted as a method of arriving at export profits. In the case of section
80HHC, the export profit is to be derived from the total business income of
the assxcessee, whereas in section 10-A, the export profit is to be derived
from the total business of the undertaking. Even in the case of business of an
undertaking, it may include export business and domestic business, in other
words, export turnover and domestic turnover. To the extent of export
turnover, there would be a commonality between the numerator and the
denominator of the formula. If the export turnover in the numerator is to be
arrived at after excluding certain expenses, the same should also be excluded
in computing the export turnover as a component of total turnover in the
denominator. The reason being the total turnover includes export turnover. The
components of the export turnover in the numerator and the denominator cannot
be different. Therefore, though there is no definition of the term 'total
turnover' in section 10A, there is nothing in the said section to mandate
that, what is excluded from the numerator that is export turnover would
nevertheless form part of the denominator. When the statute prescribed a
formula and in the said formula, 'export turnover' is defined, and when the
'total turnover' includes export turnover, the very same meaning given to the
export turnover by the legislature is to be adopted while understanding the
meaning of the total turnover, when the total turnover includes export
turnover. If what is excluded in computing the export turnover is included
while arriving at the total turnover, when the export turnover is a component
of total turnover, such an interpretation would run counter to the legislative
intent and impermissible. Thus, there is no error committed by the Tribunal in
following the judgements rendered in the context of section 80HHC in
interpreting section 10A when the principle underlying both these provisions
is one and the same".
In the light of the above binding precedents, we do not find any error or
illegality in the impugned order of CIT (Appeals) qua this issue.
18
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
11\. Other grounds of the revenue's appeal are common to the grounds raised in
the assessee's appeal regarding applicability of turnover filter as applied by
the CIT (Appeals). Since we have decided the issue of turnover filter as 10
times to the turnover of the assessee on both sides therefore, the order of
the CIT (Appeals) on this issue stands modified.
For the A.Y. 2007-08.
12\. The assessee has raised the following grounds :

14\. At the time of hearing the ld. AR has pointed out that out of the 26
comparable companies, 9 companies will be excluded by applying the turnover
filter of 10 times. The ld. AR has submitted that for the Assessment Year
2007-08, the assessee's turnover is Rs.16.35 Crores and therefore the
companies which are having more than Rs.164 Crores turnover should be
excluded.
15\. The ld. DR has relied uponthe order of the TPO/A.O and submitted that the
turnover has no role in determining the comparability and margins of the
comparable companies.
16\. We have considered the rival submissions and relevant material on record.
Since this issue is common to the issue for the Assessment Year  24 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 2005-06, therefore by applying the
multiple of 10 on both sides, the companies who are having the turnover of
more than Rs.164 Crores are as under :
                 Sl.No.                Name of Company
                 1.     Flextronics Software Systems Ltd. (Seg.)
                 2.     Helios & Matheson Information Technology
                        Ltd.
                 3.     iGate Global Solutions Ltd.
                 4.     Infosys Technologies Ltd.
                 5.     Mindtree Ltd.
                 6.     Persistent Systems Ltd.
                 7.     Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd.
                        (Seg.)
                 8.     Tata Elxsi Ltd. (Seg.)
                 9.     Wipro Ltd. (Seg.)
Accordingly, the above 9 companies are directed to be excluded from the set of
comparables.
16.1 The assessee is also seeking exclusion of two more companies namely
Geometric Ltd. (Seg) & Ishir Infotech Ltd. on the ground of RPT more than 15%
and further in case of Ishir Infotech Ltd. the employee cost is less than 25%.
In support of his contention, the ld. AR of the assessee has relied upon the
decision of the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of CSR India
Pvt. Ltd. Vs. ITO 31 taxmann.com 265 and order dt.16.10.2015 in IT(TP)A
No.1321/Bang/2011 in the case of  25 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 &
40/Bang/2012 Meritor LVS India (P.) Ltd. Vs. ACIT. The ld. AR has further
submitted that the assessee is also seeking exclusion of the other 7 companies
and correct margin in respect of Mega Soft Ltd. He has pointed out that the
comparability of all these companies have been considered by the co-
ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Meritor LVS India (P.) Ltd.
Vs. ACIT (supra).
17\. On the other hand, the ld. DR has relied upon the orders of the
authorities below.
18\. Having considered the rival submissions as well as relevant material on
record, we note tha an identical set of 26 comparables was considered by the
co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Meritor LVS India Ltd.
(supra). The Tribunal has considered the comparability of these companies in
para 12 to 14 as under :
" 12. We have perused the orders and heard the rival contentions. Assessee is
seeking exclusion of 16 comparables out of 26 companies selected by the TPO.
For this it has placed reliance on the decision of coordinate bench in the
case of Hewlett- Packard (India) Globalsoft P. Ltd, (supra). We find that
issues before this Tribunal in the case of Hewlett- Packard (India) Globalsoft
P. Ltd, (supra) was also with regard to software development services segment,
that too for the very same assessment year. Services rendered by both the
assessee as well as HPIGPL fell within the software development services
segment, and therefore in our opinion the decision of the coordinate bench in
Hewlett- Packard (India) Globalsoft P. Ltd, supra) can be taken as a good
precedent. Findings of the Tribunal in the case Hewlett- Packard (India)
Globalsoft P. Ltd, (supra) in so far as the comparables sought to be excluded
by the assessee were as under :
1) "Celestial Labs Ltd.
26
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
42\. As far as this company is concerned, the stand of the assessee is that it
is absolutely a research & development company. In this regard, the following
submissions were made:-
· In the Director's Report (page 20 of PB-Il), it is stated that "the company
has applied for Income Tax concession for in-house R&D centre expenditure at
Hyderabad under section 35(2AB) of the Income Tax Act."
· As per the Notes to Accounts - Schedule 15, under "Deferred Revenue
Expenditure" (page 31 of PB-II), it is mentioned that, "Expenditure incurred
on research and development of new products has been treated as deferred
revenue expenditure and the same has been written off in 10 years equally
yearly installments from the year in which it is incurred."
An amount of Rs. 11,692,020/- has been debited to the Profit and Loss Account
as "Deferred Revenue Expenditure" (page 30 of PB-II). This amounts to nearly
8.28 percent of the sales of this company.
It was therefore submitted that the acceptance of this company as a comparable
for the reason that it is into pure software development activities and is not
engaged in R&D activities is bad in law.
43\. Further reference was also made to the decision of the Mumbai Bench of
the Tribunal in the case of Teva Pharma Private Ltd. v. Addl. CIT - ITA
No.6623/Mum/2011 (for AY 2007-08) in which the comparability of this company
for clinical trial research segment. The relevant extract of discussion
regarding this company is as follows: "The learned D.R. however drew our
attention to page-389 of the paper book which is an extract from the Directors
report which reads as follows:
'The Company has developed a de novo drug design tool "CELSUITE" to drug
discovery in, finding the lead molecules for drug discovery and protected the
IPR by filing under the copy if sic (of) right/patent act. (Apprised and
funded by Department of Science and Technology New Delhi) based on our
insilico expertise (applying bio-informatics tools). The Company has developed
a molecule to treat Leucoderma and multiple cancer and protected the IPR by
filing the patent. The patent details have been discussed with Patent
officials and the response is very favorable. The cloning and purification
under wet lab procedures are under progress with our collaborative Institute,
Department of Microbiology, Osmania University, Hyderabad. In the industrial
biotechnology area, the company has signed the Technology transfer agreement
with IMTECH CHANDIGARH (a very reputed CSIR organization) to manufacture and
market initially two Enzymes, Alpha Amylase and Alkaline Protease in India and
overseas. The company is planning to set up a biotechnology facility to
manufacture industrial enzymes. This facility would also include the research
laboratories for carrying out further R & D activities to develop new
candidates' drug molecules and license them to Interested Pharma and  27
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 Bio Companies across the GLOBE.
The proposed Facility will be set up in Genome Valley at Hyderabad in Andhra
Pradesh.' According to the learned D.R. celestial labs is also in the field of
research in pharmaceutical products and should be considered as comparable. As
rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the Assessee, the discovery is in
relation to a software discovery of new drugs. Moreover the company also is
owner of the IPR. There is however a reference to development of a molecule to
treat cancer using bio- informatics tools for which patenting process was also
being pursued. As explained earlier it is a diversified company and therefore
cannot be considered as comparable functionally with that of the Assessee.
There has been no attempt made to identify and eliminate and make adjustment
of the profit margins so that the difference in functional comparability can
be eliminated. By not resorting to such a process of making adjustment, the
TPO has rendered this company as not qualifying for comparability. We
therefore accept the plea of the Assessee in this regard."
44\. It was submitted that the learned DR in the above case vehemently argued
that this company is into research in pharmaceutical products. The ITAT
concluded that this company is owner of IPR, it has software for discovery of
new drugs and has developed molecule to treat cancer. In the ultimate
analysis, the ITAT did not consider this company as a comparable in clinical
trial segment, for the reason that this company has diverse business. It was
submitted that, however, from the above extracts it is clear that this company
is not into software development activities, accordingly, this company should
be rejected as a comparable being functionally different.
45.From the material available on record, it transpires that the TPO has
accepted that up to AY 06-07 this company was classified as a Research and
Development company. According to the TPO in AY 07-08 this company has been
classified as software development service provider in the Capitaline/Prowess
database as well as in the annual report of this company. The TPO has relied
on the response from this company to a notice u/s.133(6) of the Act in which
it has said that it is in the business of providing software development
services. The Assessee in reply to the proposal of the AO to treat this as a
comparable has pointed out that this company provides software
products/services as well as bioinformatics services and that the segmental
data for each activity is not available and therefore this company should not
be treated as comparable. Besides the above, the Assessee has point out to
several references in the annual report for 31.3.2007 highlighting the fact
that this company was develops biotechnology products and provides related
software development services. The TPO called for segmental data at the entity
level from this company. The TPO also called for description of software
development process. In response to the request of the TPO this company in its
reply dated 29.3.2010 has given details of employees working in software
development but it is not clear as to whether any segmental data was given or
not. Besides the above there is no other detail in the TPO's order as to the
nature of  28 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 software
development services performed by the Assessee. Celestial labs had come out
with a public issue of shares and in that connection issued Draft Red Herring
Prospectus (DRHP) in which the business of this company was explained as to
clinical research. The TPO wanted to know as to whether the primary business
of this company is software development services as indicated in the annual
report for FY 06-07 or clinical research and manufacture of bio products and
other products as stated in the DRHP. There is no reference to any reply by
Celestial labs to the above clarification of the TPO. The TPO without any
basis has however concluded that the business mentioned in the DRHP are the
services or businesses that would be started by utilizing the funds garnered
though the Initial Public Offer (IPO) and thus in no way connected with
business operations of the company during FY 06-07. We are of the view that in
the light of the submissions made by the Assessee and the fact that this
company was basically/admittedly in clinical research and manufacture of bio
products and other products, there is no clear basis on which the TPO
concluded that this company was mainly in the business of providing software
development services. We therefore accept the plea of the Assessee that this
company ought not to have been considered as comparable."
2) "E-Zest Solutions Ltd.
14.1 This company was selected by the TPO as a comparable. Before the TPO, the
assessee had objected to the inclusion of this company as a comparable on the
ground that it was functionally different from the assessee. The TPO had
rejected the objections raised by the assessee on the ground that as per the
information received in response to notice under section 133(6) of the Act,
this company is engaged in software development services and satisfies all the
filters.
14.2 Before us, the learned Authorised Representative contended that this
company ought to be excluded from the list of comparables on the ground that
it is functionally different to the assessee. It is submitted by the learned
Authorised Representative that this company is engaged in 'e-Business
Consulting Services', consisting of Web Strategy Services, I T design services
and in Technology Consulting Services including product development consulting
services. These services, the learned Authorised Representative contends, are
high end ITES normally categorised as knowledge process Outsourcing ('KPO')
services. It is further submitted that this company has not provided segmental
data in its Annual Report. The learned Authorised Representative submits that
since the Annual Report of the company does not contain detailed descriptive
information on the business of the company, the assessee places reliance on
the details available on the company's website which should be considered
while evaluating the company's functional profile. It is also submitted by the
learned Authorised Representative that KPO services are not comparable to
software development services and therefore companies rendering KPO services
ought not to be considered as comparable to software development companies and
relied on the decision of the co-ordinate bench in  29 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 the case of Capital IQ Information
Systems (India) (P) Ltd. in ITA No.1961(Hyd)/2011 dt.23.11.2012 and prayed
that in view of the above reasons, this company i.e. e-Zest Solutions Ltd.,
ought to be omitted from the list of comparables.
14.3 Per contra, the learned Departmental Representative supported the
inclusion of this company in the list of comparables by the TPO.
14.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefullyconsidered
the material on record. It is seen from the record that the TPO has included
this company in the list of comparbales only on the basis of the statement
made by the company in its reply to the notice under section 133(6) of the
Act. It appears that the TPO has not examined the services rendered by the
company to give a finding whether the services performed by this company are
similar to the software development services performed by the assessee. From
the details on record, we find that while the assessee is into software
development services, this company i.e. e-Zest Solutions Ltd., is rendering
product development services and high end technical services which come under
the category of KPO services. It has been held by the co-ordinate bench of
this Tribunal in the case of Capital I-Q InformationSystems (India) (P) Ltd.
Supra) that KPO services are not comparable to software development services
and are therefore not comparable. Following the aforesaid decision of the co-
ordinate bench of the Hyderabad Tribunal in the aforesaid case, we hold that
this company, i.e. e-Zest Solutions Ltd. be omitted from the set of
comparables for the period under consideration in the case on hand. The A.O.
/TPO is accordingly directed."
3) Infosys Technologies Ltd.
12.1 This was a comparable selected by the TPO. Before the TPO, the assessee
objected to the inclusion of the company in the set of comparables, on the
grounds of turnover and brand attributable profit margin. The TPO, however,
rejected these objections raised by the assessee on the grounds that turnover
and brand aspects were not materially relevant in the software development
segment.
12.2 Before us, the assessee contended that this company is not functionally
comparable to the assessee and in this context has cited various portions of
the Annual Report of this company to this effect which is as under :-
(i) The company has an Intellectual Property (IP) Cell to guide its employees
to leverage the power of IP for their growth. In 2008, this company generated
over 102 invention disclosures and filed an aggregate 10 patents in India and
the USA. Till date this company has filed an aggregate of 119 patent
applications (pending) in India and USA out of which 2 have been granted in
the US.
(ii) This company has substantial revenues from software products and the
break-up of the software product revenues is not available.
30
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
(iii) This company has incurred huge research and development expenditure to
the tune of approximately Rs.200 Crores.
(iv) This company has a revenue sharing agreement towards acquisition of IPR
in AUTOLAY, a commercial software product used in designing high performance
structural systems.
(v) The assessee also placed reliance on the following judicial decisions :-
(a) ITAT, Delhi Bench decision in the case of Agnity India Technologies India
Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.3856/Del/2010) and
(b) Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.1054/Bang/2011) 12.3
Per contra, opposing the contentions of the assessee, the learned Departmental
Representative submitted that comparability cannot be decided merely on the
basis of scale of operations and the operating margins of this company have
not been extraordinary. In view of this, the learned Departmental
Representative supported the decision of the TPO to include this company in
the list of comparable companies.
12.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered
the material on record. We find that the assessee has brought on record
sufficient evidence to establish that this company is functionally dis-similar
and different from the assessee and hence is not comparable and the finding
rendered in the case of Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
for Assessment Year 2007-08 is applicable to this year also. The argument put
forth by assessee's is that Infosys Technologies Ltd is not functionally
comparable since it owns significant intangible and has huge revenues from
software products. It is also seen that the break up of revenue from software
services and software products is not available. In this view of the matter,
we hold that this company ought to be omitted from the set of comparable
companies. It is ordered accordingly."
4) KALS Information Systems Ltd.
"46. As far as this company is concerned, the contention of the assessee is
that the aforesaid company has revenues from both software development and
software products. Besides the above, it was also pointed out that this
company is engaged in providing training. It was also submitted that as per
the annual repot, the salary cost debited under the software development
expenditure was Q 45,93,351. The same was less than 25% of the software
services revenue and therefore the salary cost filter test fails in this case.
Reference was made to the Pune Bench Tribunal's decision of the ITAT in the
case of Bindview India Private Limited Vs. DCI, ITA No. ITA No 1386/PN/1O
wherein KALS as comparable was rejected for AY 2006-07 on account of it being
functionally different from software companies. The relevant extract are as
follows:
31
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 "16. Another issue relating to
selection of comparables by the TPO is regarding inclusion of Kals Information
System Ltd. The assessee has objected to its inclusion on the basis that
functionally the company is not comparable. With reference to pages 185-186 of
the Paper Book, it is explained that the said company is engaged in
development of software products and services and is not comparable to
software development services provided by the assessee. The appellant has
submitted an extract on pages 185-186 of the Paper Book from the website of
the company to establish that it is engaged in providing of I T enabled
services and that the said company is into development of software products,
etc. All these aspects have not been factually rebutted and, in our view, the
said concern is liable to be excluded from the final set of comparables, and
thus on this aspect, assessee succeeds."
Based on all the above, it was submitted on behalf of the assessee that KALS
Information Systems Limited should be rejected as a comparable.
47\. We have given a careful consideration to the submission made on behalf of
the Assessee. We find that the TPO has drawn conclusions on the basis of
information obtained by issue of notice u/s.133(6) of the Act. This
information which was not available in public domain could not have been used
by the TPO, when the same is contrary to the annual report of this company as
highlighted by the Assessee in its letter dated 21.6.2010 to the TPO. We also
find that in the decision referred to by the learned counsel for the Assessee,
the Mumbai Bench of ITAT has held that this company was developing software
products and not purely or mainly software development service provider. We
therefore accept the plea of the Assessee that this company is not
comparable."
5) & 6) M/S.Ishir Infotech Ltd. And Lucid Software Ltd :
"20. As far as comparable companies listed at Sl.No.11 & 14 of the final list
of comparable companies chosen by the TPO viz., M/S.Ishir Infotech Ltd. And
Lucid Software Ltd., is concerned, this Tribunal in the case of First
Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd. Vs. DCIT IT (TP) No.1086/Bang/2011 for AY
07-08 held that the aforesaid companies are not comparable companies in the
case of software development services provider. The nature of services
rendered by the Assessee in this appeal and the Assessee in the case of First
Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd.(supra) are one and the same. This fact
would be clear from the fact that the very same 26 companies were chosen as
comparable in the case of the Assessee as well as in the case of First
Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd.(supra). The following were the relevant
observations in the case of First Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd.(supra):
32
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
22\. The learned counsel for the assessee submitted that these two companies
are also to be excluded from the list of comparables on the basis of the
finding of this Tribunal in the case of Mercedes Benz Research & Development
India Pvt. Ltd. dt 22.2.2013, wherein at pages 17 and 22 of its order the
distinctions as to why these companies should be excluded are brought out. He
submitted that the facts of the case before us are similar and, therefore, the
said decision is applicable to the assessee's case also.
23\. The learned DR however objected to the exclusion of these two companies
from the list of comparables. On a careful perusal of the material on record,
we find that the Tribunal in the case of Mercedes Benz Research & Development
India Pvt. Ltd. (cited supra) has taken a note of dissimilarities between the
assessee therein and Lucid Software Ltd. As observed therein Lucid Software
Ltd. company is also involved in the development of software as compared to
the assessee, which is only into software services. Similarly, as regards
Ishir Infotech Ltd., the Tribunal has considered the decision of the Tribunal
in the case of 24/7 Co. Pvt. Ltd to hold that Ishir Infotech is also out-
sourcing its work and, therefore, has not satisfied the 25% employee cost
filter and thus has to be excluded from the list of comparables. As the facts
of the case before us are similar, respectfully following the decision of the
co-ordinate bench, we hold that these two companies are also to be excluded.
21\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal referred to above, we
direct the AO/TPO to exclude the aforesaid companies from the final list of
comparable companies for the purpose of determining ALP."
    7)    Wipro Limited
     "13.1        This company was selected as a comparable by the TPO. Before the TPO,
the assessee had objected to the inclusion of this company in the list of
comparables or several grounds like functional dis-similarity, brand value,
size, etc. The TPO, however, brushed aside the objections of the assessee and
included this company in the set of comparables.
13.2 Before us, the assessee contended that this company is functionally not
comparable to the assessee for several reasons, which are as under :
(i) This company owns significant intangibles in the nature of customer
related intangibles and technology related intangibles and quoted extracts
from the Annual Report of this company in the submissions made.
(ii) The TPO had adopted the consolidated financial statements for
comparability purposes and for computing the margins, which contradicts the
TPO's own filter of rejecting companies with consolidated financial
statements.
33
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 13.3. Per contra, the learned
Departmental Representative supported the action of the TPO in including this
company in the set of comparables.
13.4.1 We have heard both parties and carefully perused and considered the
material on record. We find merit in the contentions of the assessee for
exclusion of this company from the set of comparables. It is seen that this
company is engaged both in software development and product development
services. There is no information on the segmental bifurcation of revenue from
sale of product and software services. The TPO appears to have adopted this
company as a comparable without demonstrating how the company satisfies the
software development sales 75% of the total revenue filter adopted by him.
Another major flaw in the comparability analysis carried out by the TPO is
that he adopted comparison of the consolidated financial statements of Wipro
with the stand alone financials of the assessee; which is not an appropriate
comparison.
13.4.2 We also find that this company owns intellectual property in the form
of registered patents and several pending applications for grant of patents.
In this regard, the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of 24/7
Customer.Com Pvt. Ltd. (ITA No.227/Bang/2010) has held that a company owning
intangibles cannot be compared to a low risk captive service provider who does
not own any such intangible and hence does not have an additional advantage in
the market. As the assessee in the case on hand does not own any intangibles,
following the aforesaid decision of the co-ordinate bench of the Tribunal i.e.
24/7 Customer.Com Pvt. Ltd. (supra), we hold that this company cannot be
considered as a comparable to the assessee. We, therefore, direct the
Assessing Officer/TPO to omit this company from the set of comparable
companies in the case on hand for the year under consideration."
8) Accel Transmatic Ltd.
48\. With regard to this company, the complaint of the assessee is that this
company is not a pure software development service company. It is further
submitted that in a Mumbai Tribunal Decision of Capgemini India (F) Ltd v Ad.
CIT 12 Taxman.com 51, the DRP accepted the contention of the assessee that
Accel Transmatic should be rejected as comparable. The relevant observations
of DRP as extracted by the ITAT in its order are as follows:
"In regard to Accel Transmatics Ltd. the assessee submitted the company
profile and its annual report for financial year 2005-06 from which the DRP
noted that the business activities of the company were as under.
(i) Transmatic system - design, development and manufacture of multi function
kiosks Queue management system, ticket vending system  34 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
(ii) Ushus Technologies - offshore development centre for embedded software,
net work system, imaging technologies, outsourced product development
(iii) Accel IT Academy (the net stop for engineers)- training services in
hardware and networking, enterprise system management, embedded system, VLSI
designs, CAD/CAM/BPO
(iv) Accel Animation Studies software services for 2D/3D animation, special
effect, erection, game asset development.
4.3 On careful perusal of the business activities of Accel Transmatic Ltd. DRP
agreed with the assessee that the company was functionally different from the
assessee company as it was engaged in the services in the form of ACCEL IT and
ACCEL animation services for 2D and 3D animation and therefore assessee's
claim that this company was functionally different was accepted. DRP therefore
directed the Assessing Officer to exclude ACCEL Transmatic Ltd. from the final
list of comparables for the purpose of determining TNMM margin."
49\. Besides the above, it was pointed out that this company has related party
transactions which is more than the permitted level and therefore should not
be taken for comparability purposes. The submission of the ld. counsel for the
assessee was that if the above company should not be considered as comparable.
The ld. DR, on the other hand, relied on the order of the TPO.
50\. We have considered the submissions and are of the view that the plea of
the assessee that the aforesaid company should not be treated as comparables
was considered by the Tribunal in Capgemini India Ltd (supra) where the
assessee was software developer. The Tribunal, in the said decision referred
to by the ld. counsel for the assessee, has accepted that this company was not
comparable in the case of the assessees engaged in software development
services business. Accepting the argument of the ld. counsel for the assessee,
we hold that the aforesaid company should be excluded as comparables."
20\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal in similar set of
facts, these companies are directed to be excluded from the list of
comparables."
9) Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.
"39. As far as this company is concerned, the plea of the Assessee has been
that this company is functionally different from the assessee. Based on the
information available in the company's website, which reveals that this
company has developed a software product by name "DXchange", it was submitted
that this company would  35 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
have revenue from software product sales apart from rendering of software
services and therefore is functionally different from the assessee. It was
further submitted that the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal to the decision in the
case of Telcordia Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT - ITA No.7821/Mum/2011
wherein the Tribunal accepted the assessee's contention that this company has
revenue from software product and observed that in the absence of segmental
details, Avani Cincom cannot be considered as comparable to the assessee who
was rendering software development services only and it was held as follows:-
"7.8 Avani Cincom Technologies Ltd. ('Avani Cincom'):
Here in this case also the segmental details of operating income of IT
services and sale of software products have not been provided so as to see
whether the profit ratio of this company can be taken into consideration for
comparing the case that of assessee. In absence of any kind of details
provided by the TPO, we are unable to persuade ourselves to include it as
comparable party. Learned CIT DR has provided a copy of profit loss account
which shows that mainly its earning is from software exports, however, the
details of percentage of export of products or services have not been given.
We, therefore, reject this company also from taking into consideration for
comparability analysis."
It was also highlighted that the margin of this company at 52.59% which
represents abnormal circumstances and profits. The following figures were
placed before us:-
    Particulars         FYs 05-06              06-07            07-08      08-09
    Operating Revenue            21761611          35477523      29342809
       28039851
    Operating Expns. 16417661            23249646        23359186        31108949
    Operating Profit     5343950         12227877        5983623         (3069098)
    Operating Margin      32.55%          52.59%          25.62%          - 9.87%
40\. It was submitted that this company has made unusually high profit during
the financial year 06-07. The operating revenues increased 63.03% which
indicates that it was an extraordinary year for this company. Even the growth
of software industry for the previous year as per NASSCOM was 32%. The growth
rate of this company was double the industry average. In view of the above, it
was argued that this company ought to have been rejected as a comparable.
36
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
41\. We have given a careful consideration to the submissions made on behalf
of the Assessee and are of the view that the same deserves to be accepted. The
reasons given by the Assessee for excluding this company as comparable are
found to be acceptable. The decision of ITAT (Mumbai) in the case of Telcordia
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT (supra) also supports the plea of the assessee.
We therefore accept the plea of the Assessee to reject this company as a
comparable."
10) Flextronics Software Systems Ltd (seg) :
"26. Now taking up the question of exclusion of Flextronics Software Systems
Ltd (seg), it is true that the decision of Motorola Solutions (India) P. Ltd
(supra) also was for the very same year and also on software development
services sector. This Tribunal held as under :
"97.2 For a company to be included in the list of comparables, it is necessary
that credible information is available about the company. Unless this basic
requirement is fulfilled, the company cannot be taken as a comparable. It is
true that ld. TPO is entitled to obtain information us/ 133(6), the object of
which is primarily only to supplement the information already available on
record, but not, as rightly submitted by ld. Counsel for the assessee, to
replace the information. If there is a complete contradiction between the
information obtained u/s 133(6) and annual report then the said information
cannot be substituted for the information contained in annual report. We,
therefore, are in ITA No. 5637/D/2011 149 agreement with ld. counsel for the
assessee that this company cannot be included as a comparable in the set of
comparables selected by ld. TPO on account of clear contradiction between
contents of annual report and information obtained u/s 133(6).
27\. Rule 10D(3) specifies the information and documents that are to be
maintained by a person who is entering into international transactions. These
are official publications, published accounts or those which are in public
domain except for agreements and contracts to which assessee is privy. Once
the annual report of a company is for a year different from the financial year
ending 31st March, then without doubt, it will cease to be a good comparable,
unless the information received in pursuance to a notice u/s.133(6) of the Act
from such company, is reconciled with the figures available in such annual
report.
28\. In the case of Flextronics Software Systems Ltd (seg), no doubt the
annual report was for the year ending 31.03.2007. However it was only for a
nine months period. No reconciliation was attempted by the lower authorities
between the figures given in such annual report with the figures which were
made available by the said company to the TPO pursuant to notice issued to
them u/s.133(6) of the Act. No doubt at page 123 of TP order, TPO has stated
that the software development service revenues were more than 75% based on the
following figures :
37
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 But how this segmentation was
done by the TPO and the reconciliation of the said segmentation with the
annual report of the assessee was never attempted or done. In such a situation
we are of the opinion that Flextronics Software Solutions Ltd (seg) could not
be considered as a proper comparable. We direct exclusion thereof."
11) Helios & Matheson Information Technology Ltd :
"16. The next point made out by the assessee is with regard to the inclusion
of items at (9) and (11) namely Helios & Matheson Information Technology Ltd.,
and KALS Information Solutions Ltd. (Seg). The primary plea raised by the
assessee to assail the inclusion of the aforesaid two companies from the list
of comparables is to be effect that they are functionally incomparable and
therefore, are liable to be excluded. In sum and substance, the plea set up by
the assessee is that both the aforesaid concerns are engaged in development
and sale of software products which is functionally different from the
services undertaken by the assessee in its IT-services segment.
17\. As per the discussion in para 6.3.2. of the order of the TPO, the reason
advanced for including KALS Information Systems Ltd., is to the effect that
the said concern's application software segment is engaged in the development
of software which can be considered as comparable to the assessee company. The
said concern is engaged in two segments namely application software segment
and Training. As per the TPO, the application software segment is functionally
comparable to the assessee as the said concern is engaged in software
services. The stand of the assessee is that a perusal of the Annual Report of
the said concern for F.Y. 2006-07 reveals that the application software
segment is engaged in the business of sale of software products and software
services. The assessee pointed out this to the TPO in its written submissions,
copy of which is placed in the Paper book at page 420.3 to 420.4. The assessee
further pointed out that there was no bifurcation available between the
business of sale of software products and the business of software services,
and therefore, it was not appropriate to adopt the application software
segment of the said concern for the purposes of comparability with the
assessee's IT-Services Segment. The TPO however, noticed that though the
application software segment of  38 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 &
40/Bang/2012 the said concern may be engaged in selling of some of the
software products which are developed by it, however, the said concern was not
into trading of software products as there were no cost of purchases debited
in the Profit & Loss Account. Though the TPO agreed that the quantum of
revenue from sale of products was not available as per the financial
statements of the said concern, but as the basic function of the said concern
was software development, it was includible as it was functionally comparable
to the assessee's segment of IT-Services.
18\. Before us, apart from reiterating the points raised before the TPO and
the DRP, the Ld. Counsel submitted that in the immediately preceeding
assessment year of 2006-07, the said concern was evaluated by the assessee and
was found functionally incomparable. For the said purpose, our reference has
been invited to pages 421 to 542 of the Paper book, which is the copy of the
Transfer Pricing study undertaken by the assessee for the A.Y. 2006-07, and in
particular, attention was invited to page 454 where the accept reject matrix
undertaken by the assessee reflected KALS Information Solutions Ltd. (Seg) as
functionally incomparable. The Ld. Counsel pointed out that the aforesaid
position has been accepted by the TPO in the earlier A.Y. 2006-07 and
therefore, there was no justification for the TPO to consider the said concern
as functionally comparable in the instant assessment year.
19\. In our considered opinion, the point raised by the assessee is potent in
as much as it is quite evident that the said concern has not been found to be
functionally comparable with the assessee in the immediately preceding
assessment year and in the present year also, on the basis of the Annual
Report, referred to in the written submissions addressed to the lower
authorities, the assessee has correctly asserted out that the said concern was
inter alia engaged in sale of software products, which was quite distinct from
the activity undertaken by the assessee in the IT Services segment. At the
time of hearing, neither is there any argument put forth by the Revenue and
nor is there any discussion emerging from the orders of the lower authorities
as to in what manner the functional profile of the said concern has undergone
a change from that in the immediately preceding year. Therefore, having regard
to the factual aspects brought out by the assessee, it is correctly asserted
that the application software segment of the said concern is not comparable to
the assessee's segment of IT services.
20\. With regard to the inclusion of Helios & Matheson Information Technology
Ltd., the assessee has raised similar arguments as in the case of KALS
Information Solutions Ltd. (Seg). We have perused the relevant para of the
order of the TPO i.e., 6.3.21, in terms of which the said concern has been
included as a comparable concern. The assessee pointed out that as in the case
of KALS Information Solutions Ltd. (Seg), in the instant case also for A.Y.
2006-07 the said concern was found functionally incomparable by the assessee
in its Transfer pricing study and the said position was not disturbed by the
TPO. The relevant portion of the Transfer pricing  39 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 study, placed at page 432 of the Paper
book has been pointed out in support. Considered in the aforesaid light, on
the basis of the discussion in relation to KALS Information Solutions Ltd.
(Seg), in the instant case also we find that the said concern is liable to be
excluded from the list of comparables."
12) Persistent Systems Ltd.
"17.1.1 This company was selected by the TPO as a comparable. The assessee
objected to the inclusion of this company as a comparable for the reasons that
this company being engaged in software product designing and analytic
services, it is functionally different and further that segmental results are
not available. The TPO rejected the assessee's objections on the ground that
as per the Annual Report for the company for Financial Year 2007-08, it is
mainly a software development company and as per the details furnished in
reply to the notice under section 133(6) of the Act, software development
constitutes 96% of its revenues. In this view of the matter, the Assessing
Officer included this company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd., in the list of
comparables as it qualified the functionality criterion.
17.1.2 Before us, the assessee objected to the inclusion of this company as a
comparable submitting that this company is functionally different and also
that there are several other factors on which this company cannot be taken as
a comparable. In this regard, the learned Authorised Representative submitted
that :
(i) This company is engaged in software designing services and analytic
services and therefore it is not purely a software development service
provider as is the assessee in the case on hand.
(ii) Page 60 of the Annual Report of the company for F.Y. 2007-08 indicates
that this company, is predominantly engaged in 'Outsourced Software Product
Development Services' for independent software vendors and enterprises.
(iii) Website extracts indicate that this company is in the business of
product design services.
(iv) The ITAT, Mumbai Bench in the case of Telecordia Technologies India Pvt.
Ltd.(supra) while discussing the comparability of another company, namely
Lucid Software Ltd. had rendered a finding that in the absence of segmental
information, a company be taken into account for comparability analysis. This
principle is squarely applicable to the company presently under consideration,
which is into product development and product design services and for which
the segmental data is not available.
40
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 The learned Authorised
Representative prays that in view of the above, this company i.e. Persistent
Systems Ltd. be omitted from the list of comparables.
17.2 Per contra, the learned Departmental Representative support the action of
the TPO in including this company in the list of comparables.
17.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered
the material on record. It is seen from the details on record that this
company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd., is engaged in product development and
product design services while the assessee is a software development services
provider. We find that, as submitted by the assessee, the segmental details
are not given separately. Therefore, following the principle enunciated in the
decision of the Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Telecordia Technologies India
Pvt. Ltd. (supra) that in the absence of segmental details / information a
company cannot be taken into account for comparability analysis, we hold that
this company i.e. Persistent Systems Ltd. ought to be omitted from the set of
comparables for the year under consideration. It is ordered accordingly.
13) Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd.:
"109. Ld TPO noticed that the company was rejected in the TP document on the
ground that the company fails its filter of business review and R&D to sales
was more than 3%. However, no reasons were given for the business review.
109.1 Ld. TPO pointed out that R&D to sales being more than 3% is not
acceptable for which detailed discussion has already been made earlier. He
further noticed that the company has software services segment and segmental
results are available for software services. He further pointed out that on
the basis of information obtained u/s 133(6), the company qualifies onsite
revenue filter (onsite revenues were to the extent 27.27% of its export
revenues). After considering the assessee's reply, ld. TPO included this
company in the list of comparables. Ld. counsel pointed out that this company
has incurred significant expenditure on research and development activity the
same being 6.07% of sales. He further submitted that the company had
significant intangible inasmuch as it develops siskin branded products. The
company owns IPR Further it was pointed out before TPO that during the year
the company had acquired Botnia Hightech F. and its two subsidiaries and thus,
it had under gone significant restructuring. However, ld. TPO ignored these
facts He relied on the following decisions:
• IQ Information System (I) Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 1961/Hyd./2012 (para no. 11 &
23, page
25);
41
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 • Amerson Process Management
India Pvt. Ltd., ITA No. 8118/Mum./2010 (para 16 page 15).
110\. Ld. DR relied on the order of TPO and submitted that TPO considered the
companies software services segment details only. We have considered the rival
submissions and have perused the record of the case.
111\. Ld. TPO has completely ignored the extraordinary business circumstances
pointed out by assessee for which necessary adjustment was required to be made
in accordance with Rule 10B(3) of Income Tax Rules.
However, since this adjustment was not possible, therefore, this company
should not have been included in the list of comparables. Further, we find
that the company owns IPR and has branded products which also distinguishes it
from the assessee and, therefore, keeping in view the decision of Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of Agnity India Technologies Pvt. Ltd.(supra), we
direct the ld. TPO to exclude this comparable from the list of comparables.
If we follow the coordinate bench decision in the case of Motorala Solution
(India) P. Ltd, Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd needs to be excluded.
However, as mentioned by us at para 24 above, where the contested comparable
formed part of assessee's own study, then the AO / TPO has to be given a
chance for verification, in view of judgment of Hon'ble Pun jab & Haryana High
Court in the case of Quark Systems India P. Ltd (supra). Accordingly we remit
the issue of comparability of Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd back to
the AO / TPO for consideration afresh as per law. Ordered accordingly."
14) Tata Elxsi Ltd.
14.1 This company was a comparable selected by the TPO. Before the TPO, the
assessee had objected to the inclusion of this company in the set of
comparables on several counts like, functional dis-similarity, significant R&D
activity, brand value, size, etc. The TPO, however, rejected the contention
put forth by the assessee and included this company in the set of comparables.
14.2 Before us, it was reiterated that this company is not functionally
comparable to the assessee as it performs a variety of functions under the
software development and services segment namely  42 IT(TP)A
Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
(a) Product design services
(b) Innovation design engineering and
(c) visual computing labs.
In the submissions made the assessee had quoted relevant portions from the
Annual Report of the company to this effect. In view of this, the learned
Authorised Representative pleaded that this company be excluded from the list
of comparables.
14.3 Per contra, the learned Departmental Representative supported the stand o
the TPO in including this company in the list of comparables.
14.4.1 We have heard both parties and carefully perused and considered the
material on record. From the details on record, we find that this company is
predominantly engaged in product designing services and not purely software
development services. The details in the Annual Report show that the segment
"software development services" relates to design services and are not similar
to software development services performed by the assessee.
14.4.2 The Hon'ble Mumbai Tribunal in the case of Telecordia Technologies
India Pvt. Ltd. V ACIT (ITA No.7821/Mum/2011) has held that Tata Elxsi Ltd. is
not a software development service provider and therefore it is not
functionally comparable. In this context the relevant portion of this order is
extracted and reproduced below :-
" .... Tata Elxsi is engaged in development of niche product and development
services which is entirely different from the assessee company. We agree with
the contention of the learned Authorised Representative that the nature of
product developed and services provided by this company are different from the
assessee as have been narrated in para 6.6 above. Even the segmental details
for revenue sales have not been provided by the TPO so as to consider it as a
comparable party for comparing the profit ratio from product and services.
Thus, on these facts, we are unable to treat this company as fit for
comparability analysis for determining the arm's length price for the
assessee, hence, should be excluded from the list of comparable portion."
As can be seen from the extracts of the Annual Report of this company produced
before us, the facts pertaining to Tata Elxsi have not changed from Assessment
Year 2007-08 to Assessment Year 2008-09. We, therefore, hold that this company
is not to be considered for inclusion in the set of comparables in the case on
hand. It is ordered accordingly."

IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
15) Thirdware Solutions Ltd. (Segment) :
"15.1 This company was proposed for inclusion in the list of comparables by
the TPO. Before the TPO, the assessee objected to the inclusion of this
company in the list of comparables on the ground that its turnover was in
excess of Rs.500 Crores. Before us, the assessee has objected to the inclusion
of this company as a comparable for the reason that apart from software
development services, it is in the business of product development and trading
in software and giving licenses for use of software. In this regard, the
learned Authorised Representative submitted that :-
(i) This company is engaged in product development and earns revenue from sale
of licences and subscription. It has been pointed out from the Annual Report
that the company has not provided any separate segmental profit and loss
account for software development services and product development services.
(ii) In the case of E-Gain communications Pvt. Ltd. (2008-TII-04-ITAT-PUNE-
TP), the Tribunal has directed that this company be omitted as a comparable
for software service providers, as its income includes income from sale of
licences which has increased the margins of the company.
The learned A.R. prayed that in the light of the above facts and in view of
the afore cited decision of the Tribunal (supra), this company ought to be
omitted from the list of comparables.
15.2 Per contra, the learned Departmental Representative supported the action
of the TPO in including this company in the list of comparables.
15.3 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered
the material on record. It is seen from the material on record that the
company is engaged in product development and earns revenue from sale of
licenses and subscription. However, the segmental profit and loss accounts for
software development services and product development are not given
separately. Further, as pointed out by the learned Authorised Representative,
the Pune Bench of the Tribunal in the case of E-Gain Communications Pvt. Ltd.
(supra) has directed that since the income of this company includes income
from sale of licenses, it ought to be rejected as a comparable for software
development services.
In the case on hand, the assessee is rendering software development services.
In this factual view of the matter and following the afore cited decision of
the Pune Tribunal (supra), we direct that this company be omitted from the
list of comparables for the period under consideration in the case on hand."

IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
13\. In so far as Megasoft Ltd, is concerned, findings of the Tribunal in the
above case were as under :
> Megasoft Ltd. :
> 24\. This company was chosen as a comparable by the TPO. The objection of
> the assessee is that there are two segments in this company viz., (i)
> software development segment, and (ii) software product segment. The
> Assessee is a pure software services provider and not a software product
> developer. According to the Assessee there is no break up of revenue between
> software products and software services business on a standalone basis of
> this comparable. The TPO relied on information which was given by this
> company in which this company had explained that it has two divisions viz.,
> BLUEALLY DIVISION and XIUS-BCGI DIVISION. Xius-BCGI Division does the
> business of product software. This company develops packaged products for
> the wireless and convergent telecom industry. These products are sold as
> packaged products to customers. While implementing these standardized
> products, customers may request the company to customize products or
> reconfigure products to fit into their business environment. Thereupon the
> company takes up the job of customizing the packaged software. The company
> also explained that 30 to 40% of the product software would constitute
> packaged product and around 50% to 60% would constitute customized
> capabilities and expenses related to travelling, boarding and lodging
> expense. Based on the above reply, the TPO proceeded to hold that the
> comparable company was mainly into customization of software products
> developed (which was akin to product software) internally and that the
> portion of the revenue from development of software sold and used for
> customization was less than 25% of the overall revenues. The TPO therefore
> held that less than 25% of the revenues of the comparable are from software
> products and therefore the comparable satisfied TPO's filter of more than
> 75% of revenues from software development services. The basis on which the
> TPO arrived at the PLI of 60.23% is given at page-115 and 116 of the order
> of the TPO. It is clear from the perusal of the same that the TPO has
> proceeded to determine the PLI at the entity level and not on the basis of
> segmental data.
> 25\. In the order of the TPO, operating margin was computed for this company
> at 60.23%. It is the complaint of the assessee that the operating margins
> have been computed at entity level combining software services and software
> product segments. It was submitted that the product segment of Megasoft is
> substantially different from its software service segment. The product
> segment has employee cost of 27.65% whereas the software service segment has
> employee cost of 50%. Similarly, the profit margin on cost in product
> segment is 117.95% and in case of software service segment it is 23.11%.
> Both the segments are substantially different and therefore comparison at
> entity level is  45 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 without
> basis and would vitiate the comparability (submissions on page 381 to 383 of
> the PB-I). It was further submitted that Megasoft Limited has provided
> segmental break-up between the software services segment and software
> product segment (page 68 of PB-II), which was also adopted by the TPO in his
> show cause notice (Page 84 of PB- I). The segmental results i.e., results
> pertaining to software services segment of this company was:
                       Segmental Operating Revenues                 Rs.63,71,32,544
                       Segmental Operating Expenses                 Rs.51,75,13,211
                       Operating Profit                             Rs.11,96,19,333
                           OP/TC (PLI)                                  23.11%
> 26\. It was reiterated that in the given circumstances only PLI of software
> service segment viz., 23.11% ought to have been selected for comparison.
> 27\. It was further submitted that the learned TPO in case of other
> comparable, similarly placed, had adopted the margins of only the software
> service segment for comparability purposes. Consistent with such stand, it
> was submitted that the margins of the software segment only should be
> adopted in the case of Megasoft also, in contrast to the entity level
> margins.
> 28\. Computation of the net margin for Mega Soft Ltd. Is therefore remitted
> to the file of the TPO to compute the correct margin by following the
> direction of the Tribunal in the case of Trilogy E-Business Software India
> Pvt.Ltd."
> 23\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal referred to above,
> we direct the AO/TPO to compute the correct margin of Mega Soft Ltd., as
> directed by the Tribunal in the case of First Advantage Offshore Services
> Pvt.Ltd. (supra). Accordingly we hold that Megasoft Ltd can be considered as
> a good comparable after segmentation as directed in the above order is done.
14\. Accordingly, following the above order we direct exclusion of Celestial
Labs Ltd, E- Zest Solutions Ltd, Infosys Technologies Ltd, Kals Information
Systems Ltde (seg), Lucid Software Ltd, Wipro Ltd (seg), Accel Transmatic Ltd
(seg), Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd, Flextronics Software Systems Ltd (seg),
Helios & Matheson Information Technology Ltd, Ishir Infotech Ltd, Persistent
Systems Ltd, Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd (Seg), Tata Elxsi Ltd (seg)
and Thirdware Solutions Ltd. In so far as Megasoft Solutions Ltd is concerned,
we direct the AO / TPO to rework its segmental results and consider its
comparability only with regard to the software development services segment.
Ordered accordingly."
46
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 Accordingly, following the
order of the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal, we direct the A.O./TPO to
exclude the following companies from the set of comparables :
                   Sl.No.    Name of Company
                   1.        Accel Transmatic Ltd. (Seg.)
                   2.        Avani Cincom Technologies Ltd.
                   3.        Celestial Labs Ltd.
                   4.        E-Zest Solutions Ltd.
                   5.        Ishir Infotech Ltd.
                   6.        KALS Information Systems Ltd. (Seg.)
                   7.        Thirdware Solutions Ltd.
19\. As regards the Mega Soft Ltd., the TPO is directed to consider the
segmental results and correct amount of margin as directed by the co-
ordinate bench. After exclusion of the comparables as directed by us, the
A.O./TPO is directed to recompute the ALP by considering the remaining 8
comparables and correct margin in respect of Mega Soft Ltd.
Needless to say the benefit under proviso to section 92C shall be considered.
20\. The assessee has also raised an additional ground as under :
"2.0 On the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no justification for
the Assessing Officer for not allowing necessary deduction for a sum of
Rs.1,11,98,582/- (division eligible for relief under section10A -
Rs.81,89,903/- and division not eligible for relief under section 10A \-
Rs.30,08,679/-) representing cost of stock options and RSUs granted to the
employees of the Company by MTI the holding company or in the alternative for
a sum of  47 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 Rs13,91,337./-
when amounts were paid by the company to its parent company on vesting of the
relevant stock options / RSUs.
3.0 The Assessing Officer erred in not following the ratio of the decision of
the honourable Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Special Bench in the case of
Biocon Limited 115 TTJ 649 and the Bangalore bench of the honourable Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal in case of Novo Nordisk India (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Deputy
Commissioner of Income Tax 12(2), Bangalore. The Assessing Officer ought to
have appreciated that the said amount is in the nature of employee
compensation expenditure, is not a capital expenditure and has been expended
wholly for the business of the company."
21\. The ld. AR of the assessee has submitted that the assessee did not claim
the deduction for a sum paid in respect of Employee Stock Option which was
paid by the assessee to its parent company in lieu of the shares allotted to
the employees of the assessee under Employeees Stock Option Scheme. The ld. AR
has submitted that for the Assessment Year 2008-09, the Tribunal vide its
order dt.30.8.2016 in ITA No.1586/Bang/2012 has decided this issue in favour
of the assessee.
Accordingly, the assessee has raised this additional ground for allowing the
claim of deduction regarding Employees Stock Compensation paid to the parent
company. The ld. AR has relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of NTPC Ltd. Vs. CIT 229 ITR 383 and submitted that when the issue
has already been decided by the Tribunal for the Assessment Year 2008-09,
therefore on identical facts the claim of the assessee be allowed for the year
under consideration.
48
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012
22\. On the other hand, the ld.DR has vehemently opposed to the admission of
the additional ground and submitted that for the Assessment Year 2008-09 the
assessee claimed the deduction in respect of employee stock option
compensation which was disallowed by the Assessing Officer whereas for the
year under consideration the assessee did not claim any such deduction and
therefore the relevant facts were not examined by the Assessing Officer.
23\. We have considered the rival submissions as well as the relevant material
on record. There is no dispute that for the year under consideration the
assessee did not claim the deduction in respect of the payment made to the
parent company on account of Employees Stock Option and compensation. However
we find that an identical issue has been considered in assessee's own case for
the Assessment Year 2008-09 and it was held that it is an allowable deduction.
Therefore, so far as the issue of allowability of the deduction is concerned
it has been decided in favour of the assessee by this Tribunal by following
the decision of the Special Bench in the case of Biocon Ltd. 115 TTJ 649.
However since the relevant to details of the claim has not been examined by
the Assessing Officer and further the apportionment of the expenditure between
10A  49 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 and non-10A units is
also required to be examined and verified.
Therefore the claim of the assessee has to be apportioned between units
eligible under Section 10A and the units which is not eligible for the
deduction under Section 10A and then it has to be allowed against the
respective income of the separate units. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, we set aside this issue to the record of the
Assessing Officer for a limited purpose of verification and examination of the
relevant record regarding apportionment of the amount between the 10A unit and
non-10A unit.
24\. In the result, the cross appeals for the A.Y. 2005-06 as well as the
appeal of the assessee for the A.Y. 2007-08 AE partly allowed.

These cross appeals for the Assessment Year 2005-06 are directed against the

2\. First we take up the assessee's appeal for the Assessment Year 2005-06
wherein the assessee has raised the following grounds :
"1. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of

Per Shri Vijay Pal Rao, J.M. :
These cross appeals for the Assessment Year 2005-06 are directed against the
order dt.9.11.2011 of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-
IV, Bangalore and the assessee has filed an appeal for the Assessment  2
IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 Year 2007-08 against the
assessment order dt.26.9.2011 passe under Section 143(3) r.w.s. 144C of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short 'the Act') in pursuant to the directions of the
Dispute Resolution Panel (in short 'DRP') dt.;13.9.2011.
2\. First we take up the assessee's appeal for the Assessment Year 2005-06
wherein the assessee has raised the following grounds :
"1. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that the price charged by it to its associated
enterprises satisfied the arms length test envisaged in Chapter X of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act) and that no additions were required.
2\. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that it is a captive software development unit of
its parent company and that there were differences in functions performed,
assets employed and risks assumed as compared to independent software services
companies and adjustments were required to take into account such differences.
3\. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) - III, Bangalore erred in not appreciating the
contentions of the assessee that the rates of depreciation on fixed assts
adopted by it were higher than those followed by comparable companies and that
adjustments were required to the cost base adopted while determining the arms
length price.
the Assessing Officer and further the apportionment of the expenditure between
10A  49 IT(TP)A Nos.1247/Bang/2011 & 34 & 40/Bang/2012 and non-10A units is
also required to be examined and verified.
Therefore the claim of the assessee has to be apportioned between units
eligible under Section 10A and the units which is not eligible for the
deduction under Section 10A and then it has to be allowed against the
respective income of the separate units. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, we set aside this issue to the record of the
Assessing Officer for a limited purpose of verification and examination of the
relevant record regarding apportionment of the amount between the 10A unit and
non-10A unit.
24\. In the result, the cross appeals for the A.Y. 2005-06 as well as the
appeal of the assessee for the A.Y. 2007-08 AE partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on the 31st day of Oct., 2016.
