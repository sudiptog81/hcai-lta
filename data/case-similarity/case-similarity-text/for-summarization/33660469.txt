                                   PRESENT
                       THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE D.N.PATEL

6\. As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid facts, reasons and judicial
pronouncements, I see no reason to entertain this writ petition and to
interfere  10. with the orders, passed by the respondents at Annexure 10 and
    Order Dated 15.09.2011
    Per D.N.Patel, J.:    The present writ petition has been preferred against the
         action taken by the respondent authorities, whereby, the present petitioner has
         been dismissed from the services of Central Industrial Security Force and the
         decision, so taken by the disciplinary authority, has been confirmed or has
         been upheld by the appellate authority. These orders are dated 4th November,
         2009, which has been passed by the Senior Commandant, Central Industrial
         Security Force, Dhanbad (Annexure 10 to the memo of petition) and the
         appellate order, passed by the Deputy Inspector General, Central Industrial
         Security Force, Dhanbad, which is dated 10th December, 2009 (Annexure 12 to
         the memo of petition). The aforesaid two orders are under challenge by way of
         this writ petition.
    2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is illegality in holding the
         departmental inquiry and that the punishment awarded is shockingly
         disproportionate to the nature of misconduct and hence the orders at Annexure
         10 as well as at Annexure 12 dated 4th November, 2009 and 10th December,
         2009 respectively deserve to be quashed and set aside.
    3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has taken this Court to Rule 36 of the
         Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 2001 (in short "Rules, 2001") and
         submitted that the names of several witnesses, who have been examined,
         were not supplied with the show cause notice to the petitioner. Moreover,
         initially one inquiry was conducted by the inquiry officer, report of which was
         submitted on 26th August, 2009 to the disciplinary authority, but, the disciplinary
         authority had not agreed with that inquiry report and passed an order dated 5th
         September, 2009 (Annexure 5 to the memo of petition) for holding further
         inquiry. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that neither any
                                          2.
         reasons have been assigned by the disciplinary authority for his disagreement
         with the earlier inquiry report nor a copy of the said report of the inquiry officer
         was given to the petitioner, which makes the process of holding the inquiry
         illegal. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
         inquiry report subsequently given by the holding further inquiry is dated 10th
         October, 2009, which is based upon no evidence on record. The witnesses
         have never proved the charge, levelled against the petitioner and, therefore,
         the conclusion arrived at by the respondents that the charge has been proved,
         is dehors the facts. Learned counsel for the petitioner while relying upon a
         decision, rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Roop Singh Negi
         v. Punjab National Bank & ors., as reported in (2009)2 SCC 570, has
         submitted that if the conclusion arrived at by the inquiry officer is ipse dixit and
         based upon no evidence on record, the action taken by the disciplinary
         authority deserves to be quashed and set aside and hence also, the orders,
         passed by the respondents at Annexure 10 and 12 dated 4th November, 2009
         and 10th December, 2009 respectively deserve to be quashed and set aside
         and the writ petition deserves to be allowed.
    4.   Learned Assistant Solicitor General of India, appearing for the respondents,
         vehemently submitted that the petitioner is a member of disciplined force,
         namely, Central Industrial Security Force and is waded with high standard of
         discipline. The allegation against the petitioner, as stated in the memo of
         charge, which is at Annexure 1 to the memo of petition, is that while he was on
         duty on 21st May, 2009 from 5.00 hours to 13.00 hours at a workshop, Sinidih
         (Dhanbad), where excavation work of Bharat Coking Coal Limited was going
         on, one Sanjay Kumar and Ravindra Kumar had seen this petitioner facilitating
         some unknown persons to take away certain stolen articles, belonging to the
         B.C.C.L. Immediately these two witnesses inquired, the unknown persons ran
         away and the items were found to be belonging to the Public Sector
         Undertaking. Several employees have also seen this stolen articles and
         ultimately, it was reported to the higher officers for further inquiry. The
         personnel of Central Industrial Security Force were sent at the place and
         ultimately, the memo of charge was issued to the present petitioner and after
         giving him an adequate opportunity of being heard and following the procedure,
         a report was given by the inquiry officer. Initially the report, which was
         submitted by the inquiry officer, was perused by the disciplinary authority and it
         was found that though it was mentioned that the charge levelled against the
         petitioner has been proved, still the materials, which were on record, were not
                                     3.
    properly appreciated and, hence, as per Sub-rule 21(i) of Rule 36 of the Rules,
    2001, enacted in exercise of the power conferred under Section 22 of the
    Central Industrial Security Force Act, 1968, the disciplinary authority passed an
    order on 5th September, 2009 (Annexure 5 to the memo of petition) for holding
    further inquiry. Thereafter also, again an adequate opportunity of being heard
    was given to the petitioner. Further witnesses were examined and the cross-
    examination of those witnesses was also offered to the petitioner and there
    was actually cross-examination also of all the witnesses, during the course of
    departmental inquiry. The report was finally given on 10th October, 2001 by the
    inquiry officer, which is at Annexure 16/1 to the supplementary affidavit, filed by
    the petitioner, and after giving one more opportunity of hearing to the petitioner,
    ultimately a decision was taken by the disciplinary authority of termination of
    the services of the petitioner. This decision was taken by the Sr. Commandant,
    Central Industrial Security Force, Dhanbad, by his detailed order dated 4th
    November, 2009 (Annexure 10 to the memo of petition). In subsequent
    opportunity, objections were also raised by the petitioner, which is dated 14th
    October, 2009. Thus, the disciplinary authority has considered the whole
    departmental proceedings and the evidence on record as also the objections,
    raised by the petitioner and concluded that the petitioner deserved to be
    dismissed from the services. It is further submitted by the learned Assistant
    Solicitor General of India that one more opportunity was given to the petitioner
    for preferring an appeal under the provisions of Rule 46 of the Rule, 2001.
    Thus, one more opportunity of being heard was given to the petitioner and the
    appellate authority i.e. Deputy Inspector General, Central Industrial Security
    Force, Dhanbad,has upheld the decision, taken by the disciplinary authority i.e.
    Sr. Commandant, Central Industrial Security Force, Dhanbad and the appeal
    preferred by the petitioner was dismissed vide order dated 10th December,
    2009, which is at Annexure 12 to the memo of petition. Thus, it is submitted by
    the learned counsel for the Union of India that there is no procedural lacuna or
    lapses. Scrupulously the procedure have been followed and complied with.
          So far as the quantum of punishment is concerned, it is submitted by the
    learned counsel for the Union of India that looking to the nature of misconduct
    committed by the present petitioner, it cannot be said that the punishment
    awarded to the petitioner is shockingly disproportionate to the charges. On the
    contrary, the punishment is absolutely in consonence with the nature of
    offence, committed by the present petitioner. The petitioner being a member of
    the disciplined force is not supposed to facilitate the theft of articles, belonging
                                         4.
         to the Public Sector Undertakings. Learned counsel for the respondents has
         relied upon a decision, rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
         Govt. of A.P. & ors. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan, as reported in (2006)2 SCC
         373 (especially paragraph no.15 thereof) and has submitted that thus, no
         illegality has been committed by the respondents in terminating the services of
         the petitioner, who was a constable in Central Industrial Security Force and
         hence the writ petition deserves to be dismissed.
    5.   Having heard learned counsel for both the sides and looking to the facts and
         circumstances of the case, I see no reason to entertain this writ petition, mainly
         for the following facts and reasons:
         (i)   The petitioner was a constable in Central Industrial Security Force. The
               charge levelled against the petitioner is to the effect that on 21st May,
               2009 at about 8.30 hours, two employees, belonging to Bharat Coking
               Coal Limited while coming out of A.T.M. (Automatic Tailor Machine), saw
               that the present petitioner was facilitating some unknown persons in
               taking away certain articles and these two employees of B.C.C.L. asked
               as to what is in the bag. No sooner this query was raised, the unknown
               persons ran away and ultimately, it was found out that they were the
               stolen articles, belonging to B.C.C.L. Other employees had also seen
               that these articles were belonging to the excavation workshop at Sinidih,
               Dhanbad. Thereafter, a report was given to the higher authorities, on the
               basis of which the memo of charge (Annexure 1 to the memo of petition)
               was given to the petitioner on 9th June, 2009.
                     Thereafter, inquiry was conducted; charge levelled against the
               petitioner was proved and report was submitted on 26th August, 2009 to
               the disciplinary authority. Initially the report, which was submitted by the
               inquiry officer, was perused by the disciplinary authority and it was found
               that though it was mentioned that the charge levelled against the
               petitioner has been proved, still the materials, which were on record,
               were not properly appreciated and, hence, the disciplinary authority in
               exercise of the powers under Sub-rule 21(i) of Rule 36 of the Rules,
               2001, has recorded the reasons and directed the inquiry officer to
               conduct further inquiry, vide order dated 5th September, 2009 (Annexure
               5 to the memo of petition). For ready reference, Sub-rule 21 of Rule 36
               of the Rules, 2001 is being quoted hereunder:
                     "36. Procedure for imposing major penalties.-
                            xxx                 xxx               xxx
                                             5.
                 (21)(i) The disciplinary authority, if it is not itself the inquiry
                 authority, may consider the records of inquiry and record its
                 findings on each charge. The disciplinary authority may, for
                 reasons to be recorded by it in writing, remit the case to the
                 inquiring authority for further inquiry and report and the inquiry
                 authority shall thereupon proceed to hold the further inquiry
                 according to the provisions of this rule as far as may be.
                        xxx                 xxx                 xxx"
                                                                (Emphasis supplied)
                 In view of the aforesaid provisions of the Rules, 2001, which has
           been enacted in exercise of the powers under Section 22 of the Central
           Industrial Security Force Act, 1968, no illegality has been committed by
           the disciplinary authority in passing the order at Annexure 5 dated
           5.9.2009
.
(ii) It further appears from the facts of the case that thereafter, again the
petitioner was given adequate opportunity of being heard; further witnesses
have been examined, who were connected with the incident of theft of articles,
belonging to the Public Sector Undertaking, and ultimately a final inquiry
report was submitted on 10th October, 2009. The said report is at Annexure
16/1 of the supplementary affidavit, filed by the petitioner.
Looking to the evidences on record, it cannot be said that the inquiry
officer's report is based upon "no evidence". On the contrary, there are
sufficient and adequate evidences on record to prove the charge, levelled
against the present petitioner. Thus, the contention raised by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that the report given by the inquiry officer is
based upon "no evidence" is not accepted by this Court. The respondents have
examined as many as half a dozen witnesses and most of them have corroborated
the incident of theft and, therefore, even if one or two witnesses have
slightly given evidence in favour of the petitioner that has rightly been
appreciated by the inquiry officer in the light of the evidences given by rest
of the witnesses, examined during the course of proceeding. As this Court
cannot sit in appeal against the inquiry officer's report, sufficient it to
say that there is no procedural lacuna in holding the departmental proceeding
and there were sufficient materials on the record for the inquiry officer to
come to the conclusion that the charge levelled against the petitioner is
proved.
6.
(iii) It further appears from the facts of the case that thereafter, the
petitioner was given further opportunity of representing his case, after
submission of the report by the inquiry officer dated 10th October, 2009,
before the actual award of punishment. The petitioner has also raised
objections on 14th October, 2009 and thereafter, considering the inquiry
officer's report and the objections, raised by the petitioner dated 14th
October, 2009, the disciplinary authority, namely, Sr. Commandant, Central
Industrial Security Force, Dhanbad, passed a detailed order, which is at
Annexure 10 to the memo of petition dated 4th November, 2009 and ultimately,
the punishment of dismissal from services has been awarded to the petitioner.
This punishment has been awarded in exercise of the powers, conferred upon the
disciplinary authority under Rule 36 of the Rules, 2001\.
Thus, here also before imposing the punishment, proper procedure has been
followed, inviting attention of the petitioner upon the inquiry officer's
report and his objections were also considered.
(iv) It further appears from the facts of the case that as per Rule 46 of the
Rules, 2001, further opportunity of preferring a departmental appeal was given
to the petitioner and the petitioner has availed this opportunity. The
appellate authority, namely, Deputy Inspector General, Central Industrial
Security Force, Dhanbad, after giving an adequate opportunity of being heard
to the petitioner, upheld the decision taken by the disciplinary authority and
has dismissed the appeal, preferred by the petitioner. This order is at
Annexure 12 to the memo of petition dated 10th December, 2009\.
Thus, there is neither any procedural lapses while holding the departmental
proceeding nor is there any procedural lapses while awarding the punishment by
the disciplinary authority nor while conducting the appellate proceedings.
(v) Now, the question left out to be decided by this Court is the quantum of
punishment.
Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as for the respondents have read
and re-read the charge levelled against the petitioner, which is at Annexure 1
to the memo of petition, which has been proved as per the report, given by the
inquiry officer dated 10th October, 2009.
(vi) Looking to the nature of misconduct of the petitioner and the punishment
awarded to him by the disciplinary authority vide order dated 4th  7.
November, 2009, it cannot be levelled as shockingly disproportionate to the
charge levelled against the petitioner. The petitioner is a member of
disciplined force. He is a constable in the Central Industrial Security Force.
His duty, amongst several other duties, is to protect the properties of Public
Sector Undertakings, especially from theft. If he is indulged in these types
of activities, serious views ought to have been taken and he deserves
stringent punishment and, thus, an adequate and proportionate punishment has
been awarded by the disciplinary authority, namely, dismissal from service. I,
therefore, see no reason to interfere with the quantum of punishment, awarded
to the present petitioner.
It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Govt. of A.P. &
ors. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan, as reported in (2006)2 SCC 373 at paragraph
no.15 as under:
> "15. This takes us to the last submission of the counsel for the respondent.
> Learned counsel for the respondent contended that the offence, said to have
> been committed, being minor in nature and no loss being caused to the owner
> of the property, inasmuch as the same had been recovered on the spot,
> lenient punishment may be awarded in place of dismissal from service. We are
> unable to countenance this submission. The gravity of the offence must
> necessarily be measured with the nature of the offence. The respondent was a
> member of a disciplined force holding the rank of Head Constable. The duty
> assigned to him was a "bandobast" duty during the visit of the then
> President Bill Clinton, who ran a security risk of the highest grade. His
> misconduct could have led to serious security lapse resulting in fatal
> consequences. But, because of timely detection by the electrician, PW 4, the
> lens was recovered and immediately restored. We entirely agree with the
> inquiry officer that the charges are serious in nature, being committed by a
> member of a disciplined force, who deserved stringent punishment. To instil
> the confidence of the public in the establishment, the only appropriate
> punishment in such cases is dismissal from service, which has been correctly
> awarded.
(Emphasis supplied) In the aforesaid case also the delinquent was a member of
police force. The charged levelled against that petitioner was attempt of
theft and upon proof of this misconduct, he was dismissed from the services,
8. which has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with the aforesaid
observations.
In the facts of the present case also, the petitioner is a constable in the
Central Industrial Security Force. The very purposes of the Central Industrial
Security Force is to protect the sabotage of the properties, belonging to the
Public Sector Undertakings. They have to watch and ward all the properties of
the Public Sector Undertakings. The very purpose for which the Central
Industrial Security Force Act, 1968 was brought into effect is to protect the
properties of the Public Sector Undertakings, especially from theft. The
statement of objects and reasons of the Central Industrial Security Force Act,
1968 reads as under:
> "STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS:
> At present security arrangements at important industrial undertakings in the
> public sector are handled by the Watch and Ward staff of the organization
> concerned. The Watch and Ward staff is generally engaged in guarding the
> entrances or the perimeter of the industrial undertaking and in preventing
> entries of unauthorized persons. Unplanned recruitment, inadequate
> supervision, training and discipline have made the existing Watch and Ward
> staff ill-equipped to discharge its responsibilities. It is considered
> necessary to strengthen the security arrangements in vital industrial
> undertakings. For that purpose it is proposed to constitute a centrally
> recruited, organized and trained Industrial Security Force. The Force will
> primarily be responsible for the watch and ward of industrial undertakings
> owned by the Central Government and may be deployed at the request and cost
> of managements, for security duties of industrial undertakings in public
> sector.
> 2\. The Bill is intended to give effect to these proposals.
> 3\. The following are the principal features of the Bill:-
> (a) The Central Industrial Security Force will be constituted and maintained
> primarily for the better protection and maintenance of industrial
> undertakings owned by the Central Government (clause 3 of the Bill).
> (b) The Superintendence of the Force shall vest in the Central Government

6\. As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid facts, reasons and judicial
pronouncements, I see no reason to entertain this writ petition and to
interfere  10. with the orders, passed by the respondents at Annexure 10 and
Annexure 12 dated 4th November, 2009 and 10th December, 2009 respectively.
This writ petition is accordingly, dismissed.

6\. As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid facts, reasons and judicial
pronouncements, I see no reason to entertain this writ petition and to
interfere  10. with the orders, passed by the respondents at Annexure 10 and
    Order Dated 15.09.2011
    Per D.N.Patel, J.:    The present writ petition has been preferred against the
         action taken by the respondent authorities, whereby, the present petitioner has
         been dismissed from the services of Central Industrial Security Force and the
         decision, so taken by the disciplinary authority, has been confirmed or has
         been upheld by the appellate authority. These orders are dated 4th November,
         2009, which has been passed by the Senior Commandant, Central Industrial
         Security Force, Dhanbad (Annexure 10 to the memo of petition) and the
         appellate order, passed by the Deputy Inspector General, Central Industrial
         Security Force, Dhanbad, which is dated 10th December, 2009 (Annexure 12 to
         the memo of petition). The aforesaid two orders are under challenge by way of
         this writ petition.
    2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is illegality in holding the
         departmental inquiry and that the punishment awarded is shockingly
         disproportionate to the nature of misconduct and hence the orders at Annexure
         10 as well as at Annexure 12 dated 4th November, 2009 and 10th December,
         2009 respectively deserve to be quashed and set aside.
    3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has taken this Court to Rule 36 of the
         Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 2001 (in short "Rules, 2001") and
         submitted that the names of several witnesses, who have been examined,

6\. As a cumulative effect of the aforesaid facts, reasons and judicial
pronouncements, I see no reason to entertain this writ petition and to
interfere  10. with the orders, passed by the respondents at Annexure 10 and
    Order Dated 15.09.2011
    Per D.N.Patel, J.:    The present writ petition has been preferred against the
         action taken by the respondent authorities, whereby, the present petitioner has
         been dismissed from the services of Central Industrial Security Force and the
         decision, so taken by the disciplinary authority, has been confirmed or has
         been upheld by the appellate authority. These orders are dated 4th November,
         2009, which has been passed by the Senior Commandant, Central Industrial
         Security Force, Dhanbad (Annexure 10 to the memo of petition) and the

         2009 respectively deserve to be quashed and set aside.
    3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has taken this Court to Rule 36 of the

    Order Dated 15.09.2011
    Per D.N.Patel, J.:    The present writ petition has been preferred against the

    2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is illegality in holding the

    3.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has taken this Court to Rule 36 of the
         Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 2001 (in short "Rules, 2001") and
         submitted that the names of several witnesses, who have been examined,
         were not supplied with the show cause notice to the petitioner. Moreover,
         initially one inquiry was conducted by the inquiry officer, report of which was
         submitted on 26th August, 2009 to the disciplinary authority, but, the disciplinary
         authority had not agreed with that inquiry report and passed an order dated 5th
         September, 2009 (Annexure 5 to the memo of petition) for holding further
         inquiry. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that neither any
                                          2.
         reasons have been assigned by the disciplinary authority for his disagreement
         with the earlier inquiry report nor a copy of the said report of the inquiry officer
         was given to the petitioner, which makes the process of holding the inquiry
         illegal. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
