             BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY AND ANR. ..... Plaintiffs
                               Through: Mr.    Guru     Krishnakumar,
                                        Senior Advocate, Mr. Sudhir
                                        Chandra, Senior Advocate with
                                        Mr. Pravin Anand,
                                        Mr. Prasanna Venkat,
                                        Mr. Nischal Anand and
                                        Mr. Aman Taneja, Advocates
                                         versus
             V.C. BHUTADA & ORS.                                    ..... Defendants
                               Through:                Mr. Vivek Sarin and
                                                       Mr. Manish Jain, Advocates for
in the present plaint, which is in a quia timet action, are prima facie
sufficient to show that Defendant No.2 "carries on business" in Delhi and that
the prima facie the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction of this
Court.
32\. Needless to clarify that the final determination on whether the Court has
territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit will have to await the
completion of the trial as it is a mixed question of law and fact. On the
basis of the CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 17 of 18 averment in the plaint at
this stage it is not necessary for the Court to, and in fact it cannot,
conclusively hold that this Court either has or lacks the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
33\. In that view of the matter, this application is dismissed. However, a
specific issue concerning territorial jurisdiction of the Court will be framed
for determination at the appropriate stage.

    1.
This is an application by the Defendant No. 2 under Section 20 read with Order
VII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('CPC') seeking return of the
plaint to the Plaintiff for presentation in the appropriate court.
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 1 of 18
2\. The background to the present application is that the aforementioned suit
has been filed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company (Plaintiff No.1) and Bristol
Myers Squibb India Private Limited (Plaintiff No.2) against Mr. V.C. Bhutada,
the Managing Director ('MD') of Shilpa Medicare Limited (Defendant Nos.1 and 2
respectively), both located at Raichur, Karnataka and Natco Pharma Limited
(Defendant No.3), having its office in Hyderabad and also shown as operating
from D-70, Okhla Industrial Area, Okhla Phase-I, New Delhi. The prayer in the
suit is for a permanent injunction restraining infringement of Indian patent
No. 203937, damages, rendition of accounts and delivery up.
3\. The Plaintiffs state that Plaintiff No.1was founded under its present name
in the year 1989 as a result of a merger between Bristol Myers Company and
John Ripley Myers and Squibb Corporation, both stated to be pharmaceutical
giants. Plaintiff No.1 has its principal place of business in New York, USA.
Plaintiff No.2 was incorporated under the Indian Companies Act 1956, and has
its registered office in Mumbai. It is stated that Plaintiff No.2 also carries
on business from its office at Barakhamba Road, New Delhi. Plaintiff No.2 is a
subsidiary of Plaintiff No.1 and markets pharmaceutical products in the
domestic market. It is stated that the Plaintiffs have a strong presence in
various therapeutic areas, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
obesity, psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and
rheumatoid arthritis.
4\. It is stated that an active pharmaceutical ingredient ('API'), DASATINIB
was invented by Plaintiff No.1, for which it enjoys patent protection in
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 2 of 18 several countries, including India, under
Patent No.203937 dated 12th April 2000\. The details of the patent
registration in relation to DASATINIB under Indian patent No. 203937 in favour
of Plaintiff No.1 have been set out in para13. It is stated that marketing
approval for DASATINIB was granted by the Drug Controller General of India
('DCGI') on 30th August 2006 to Plaintiff No.2, who is, since then, marketing
DASATINIB under the trade name 'SPRYCEL' across India.
5\. It is stated that DASATINIB is an anti-cancer molecule used in the
treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated or myeloid or lymphoid blast
phase chronic myeloid leukaemia ('CML') with resistance or intolerance to
prior therapy, including imatinib as well as treatment of adults who have a
particular form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ('ALL') called chromosome-
positive (Ph+) ALL. It is stated that CML is one of the most common forms of
leukaemia. It is stated that although imatinib mesylate, a small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitor ('TKI'), was the designed drug for CML, since
certain cases of imatinib resistant CML were emerging, for combating imatinib-
resistant CML, a new generation of inhibitor, such as DASATINIB, was invented.
6\. Relevant to the present application, the facts are that Defendant No.2,
Shilpa Medicare Limited, having its principal place of business at Raichur,
Karnataka, is a bulk drug manufacturer, which carries on the business of
manufacturing, selling and offering for sale and exporting bulk API, fine
chemicals, intermediates, herbal products and specialty chemical products to
various pharmaceutical companies within the domestic and global markets.
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 3 of 18
It is stated that Defendant No.1 is the MD of Defendant No.2. Defendants 1 and
2 are stated to have tied up with various generic pharmaceutical companies in
India. Defendant No.3, Natco Pharma Limited, having its principal place of
business in Hyderabad, carries on the business of manufacturing, selling,
offering for sale various generic pharmaceutical products all over India,
including within the jurisdiction of this Court.
7\. In para 27 of the plaint, it is stated that in the third week of August
2012, the Plaintiffs came to know that Defendants 1 and 2 were in the process
of manufacturing DASATINIB (API), covered by the Indian Patent No. 203937\. As
on the date of the filing of the suit, i.e., 13th September 2012, the
Plaintiffs stated to the best of their knowledge that "the said Defendants
have not started supplying DASATINIB (API) to various generic companies."
Through an application made under the Right to Information Act, 2005 to the
Drugs Control Department, Karnataka, the Plaintiffs learnt that Defendant No.2
had applied for and had been granted a manufacturing licence by the Drug
Controller Licensing Authority, Karnataka for manufacturing DASATINIB bulk
drug. It is further stated that, on its website, Defendant No.2 has listed
DASATINIB in their product list as 'under developed Oncology Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients.'
8\. As regards Defendant No.3, it is stated that in relation to its conduct in
the past, with respect to the invention claimed in the suit patent, the
Plaintiff has filed CS (OS) No. 2279 of 2009, which is pending in this Court.
It is stated that in the said suit, on 22nd June 2012, an interim order was
passed by the Court restraining Defendant No.3 in the present suit and the
other CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 4 of 18 Defendants in the said suit from
manufacturing and selling any product that infringes the Plaintiffs'
registered patent No. 203937. In para 35, it is stated that Defendant No.3 had
approached Defendants 1 and 2 for procuring bulk DASATINIB (API) and,
therefore, the Plaintiffs had a real and reasonable apprehension that
Defendant No.3 would continue to infringe the invention of the Plaintiffs with
the assistance of Defendants 1 and 2.
9\. In para 36 of the plaint it is averred as under:
> "36. It is respectfully submitted that in light of the aforementioned facts
> and circumstances, the Plaintiffs have real and reasonable apprehension that
> the Defendant Nos.1 & 2 are in the process of manufacturing DASATINIB (API)
> and are soon going to sell and/or offer for sale DASATINIB (API) to various
> generic pharmaceutical companies located in India including but not limited
> to Defendant No.3. Defendant Nos.1 & 2 are further likely to increase their
> revenue by exporting bulk quantities of DASATINIB (API) to various
> international pharmaceutical companies located abroad."
10\. Para 40, which is the cause of action paragraph, reads as under: "40. In
the light of the abovementioned facts, it is submitted that the cause of
action first arose in the third week of August, 2012 when the Plaintiff
received information that the Defendants had applied for and had been granted
manufacturing licenses for bulk DASATINIB (API) and intend to soon
commercialize and market and supply the same to various generic manufactures
in India and abroad. The cause of action is a continuing one and will continue
to subsist until this Hon'ble Court restrains the Defendants from their
infringing activities."
11\. As regards the jurisdiction of this Court the Plaintiff has averred in
para 41 as under:
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 5 of 18
> "41. It is respectfully submitted that this Hon'ble Court has the
> jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit under Section 20 of the
> Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
> (i) It is respectfully submitted that a part of the cause of action has
> arisen in Delhi as Defendant Nos.1 & 2 have customers, consumers, buyers and
> host of other persons for various aspects of their business activities and
> are thus involved in a large number of activities which establish beyond
> doubt that they have purposefully availed of Delhi and targeted Delhi.
> Defendant Nos.1 & 2 have numerous commercial arrangement by virtue of which
> they supply bulk API especially oncology APIs to various generic companies
> located within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. It is respectfully
> submitted that Defendant Nos.1 & 2 have thus purposefully availed the
> jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.
> (ii) It is further apprehended that if, Defendant Nos.1 & 2 start supplying,
> DASATINIB (API), the same would be available within the jurisdiction of this
> Hon'ble Court. It is submitted that the threat that Defendant Nos.1 & 2 will
> sell and/or offer for sale bulk DASATINIB (API) within the jurisdiction of
> this Hon'ble Court is credible and imminent. Thus, giving rise to a
> substantial and integral part of the cause of action within the jurisdiction
> of this Hon'ble Court.
> (iii) It is further submitted that it is verily believed that Defendant No.3
> has approached Defendant Nos.1 & 2 for procuring bulk DASATINIB (API). It is
> submitted that Defendant No.3 carries on business within the jurisdiction of
> this Hon'ble Court from its office located at D-70, Okhla Industrial Area,
> Okhla Phase-I and D-70, second floor, Okhla Industrial Area, Okhla Phase-I,
> New Delhi 110 020 and through various exclusive agents and authorized agents
> located within Delhi. It is thus apprehended that Defendant No.3 will
> procure DASATINIB (API) from Defendant Nos.1 & 2 and sell and offer for sale
> the finished impugned product DASANAT, which infringes the suit patent
> within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. It is further submitted that
> pleading in CS (OS) No. 2279 of 2009 clearly show that the impugned product
> DASANAT is available within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court."
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 6 of 18
12\. Summons in the suit and notice in the application were issued on 14th
September 2012. In its written statement filed on 17th December 2012,
Defendant No.3 stated that it had no relationship with Defendant Nos. 1 and 2
and that the suit had been filed only to multiply the litigation against
Defendant No.3. Defendant No.3 questioned the validity of the patent granted
in favour of the Plaintiff. Defendant No.3 denied planning to procure any
DASATINIB (API) from Defendants 1 and 2. Further Defendant No.3 stated that as
of date it is not manufacturing or selling DASATINIB in the market and "to the
best of (the knowledge of) this Defendant even Defendant No.1 and 2 are not
selling the product in the market." Defendant No.3 pointed out that the
Plaintiffs have not filed a single document to show that the Defendants are
carrying business activities within the territorial jurisdiction of this
Court.
13\. In its written statement Defendant No.2 has stated that it has not
entered into any commercial understanding with any of its customers located in
Delhi and, therefore, no cause of action arose against Defendant No.2 within
the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. It is pointed out that "no document
to at least substantiate prima facie the existence of any commercial
understanding between the Defendant Nos. 2 and 3 and also between the
Defendant No.2 and its customers has been produced." Defendant No.2 stated
that it is located in Raichur district, Karnataka and has no principal or
subordinate office within the territorial limits of this Court and therefore
no cause of action arises within the state of Delhi. It is stated that the
alleged act of manufacturing which formed the basis of filing the present suit
has never taken place either in Delhi or in Raichur.
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 7 of 18
14\. Defendant No.2 further stated that it is in the process of seeking
clarification from the Drugs Control Department, Government of Karnataka, as
the manufacturing license does not mention DASATINIB MONOHYDRATE and merely
refers to DASATINIB. It is stated that DASATINIB and DASATINIB MONOHYDRATE are
two different molecules and are two different chemical entities and,
therefore, no action can be brought against Defendant No.2 on the basis of the
alleged claim for DASATINIB under Indian Patent No. 203937.
15\. In the present application filed under Order VII Rule 10 CPC, it is
stated by Defendant No.2 that the manufacturing license has been granted to it
by the State Drugs Control Department of Karnataka for its manufacturing unit
located in district Raichur, Karnataka. It is reiterated that Defendant No.2
neither has a registered office nor a branch office in Delhi and, therefore,
the Court does not have any territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. It
is alleged that the Plaintiffs have indulged in forum shopping and, therefore,
the plaint must either be rejected or returned.
16\. In reply to this application, it is stated by the Plaintiffs that a part
of the cause of action has arisen in Delhi, as Defendants 1 and 2 have
customers, consumers, buyers and host of other persons for various aspects of
their business activities in Delhi and thus have "purposefully availed of
Delhi and targeted Delhi". It is pointed out that in its written statement
Defendant No. 2 admitted that it has customers located in Delhi. It is further
reiterated that Defendant No.2 has numerous commercial arrangements with
generic companies such as Defendant No.3 and supplies API to the said
companies, CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 8 of 18 who, in turn, sell/offer for
sale, distribute the same within the jurisdiction of this Court. A reference
is made to the website of Defendant No.2 which advertises/offers for sale the
impugned product and which offer is accessible within the jurisdiction of this
Court. It is submitted that the threat that Defendant No.2 will sell/offer for
sale DASATINIB (API) either on its own or through its customers or other
generic companies, including Defendant No.3, within the jurisdiction of this
Court "is credible and imminent" and, therefore, "a substantial and integral
part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court."
17\. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Guru Krishnakumar, and Mr.
Sudhir Chandra, Senior Advocates appearing for the Plaintiffs, Mr. Vivek Sarin
and Mr. Manish Jain, Advocates for Defendants 1 and 2 and Mr. Garud M.V.,
Advocate for Defendant No.3.
18\. In approaching the issue whether the Court has territorial jurisdiction
to entertain the present suit, reference has to necessarily be made to Section
20 of the CPC and Section 62 of the Patents Act 1970 ('Patents Act'), which
read as under:
> Section 20 CPC Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause
> of action arises. - Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall
> be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction--
> (a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one,
> at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily
> resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or CS(OS) No.
> 2801 of 2012 Page 9 of 18
> (b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the
> commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on
> business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either
> the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or
> carry on business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in
> such institution; or
> (c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.
> Section 62 Patents Act Rights of patentees of lapsed patents which have been
> restored.-- (1) Where a patent is restored, the rights of the patentee shall
> be subject to such provisions as may be prescribed and to such other
> provisions as the Controller thinks fit to impose for the protection or
> compensation of persons who may have begun to avail themselves of, or have
> taken definite steps by contract or otherwise to avail themselves of, the
> patented invention between the date when the patent ceased to have effect
> and the date of publication of the application for restoration of the patent
> under this Chapter.
> (2) No suit or other proceeding shall be commenced or prosecuted in respect
> of an infringement of a patent committed between the date on which the
> patent ceased to have effect and the date of the publication of the
> application for restoration of the patent.
19\. Also relevant is Section 48 (a) of the Patent Act which states that the
holder of a patent for a product can seek to prevent infringement of such
patent by a person who "offers for sale" that product anywhere in India. In
the present case, the attempt by the Plaintiff is to show that on a collective
reading of Section 20 (c) CPC and Section 62 (2) Patents Act, the Defendants
carry on business by "offering for sale" their products within the
jurisdiction of this Court and further that the cause of action wholly or
partly arises within the local limits of this Court. At this juncture, it may
also be noted that under Section 104 of the Patents Act, a suit for
infringement is CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 10 of 18 required to be
instituted in a district court "having jurisdiction to try the suit." The
proviso states that where a counter-claim for revocation of the patent is made
by the Defendant, the suit, along with the counter-claim, shall be transferred
to the High Court for decision. Under Section 2 (1) (e) of the Patents Act the
district court has the meaning assigned to that expression by the CPC.
Therefore, relevant to the question that arises for determination in the
present application are sub-clauses (a) and (c) of Section 20 of the CPC.
20\. From the averments in the plaint it is seen that the Plaintiffs are
seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court on the basis of the threat or
apprehension that the actions of the Defendant within the territorial
jurisdiction of this Court are likely to cause prejudice to the Plaintiff. In
other words, this suit is in the nature of quia timet action. The Plaintiffs
urge that such action can be entertained by the Court, even if the threat has
not culminated into a reality. So, one of the issues that arises for
determination is whether, in the facts and circumstances of the present case,
based on the averments made in the plaint, it can be said that the Court has
territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. Particular to the present
case, the question that arises is whether the mere apprehension of the
Plaintiff or its perception of a threat of infringement by the Defendants of
its patent occurring within the local limits of this Court is sufficient to
attract the jurisdiction of this Court.
21\. Learned counsel for Defendant No.2 referred to the decision in Dhodha
House v. S.K. Maingi (2006) 9 SCC 41 which held that mere sale through a
commission agent or otherwise of the goods will not satisfy the requirement
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 11 of 18 of the expression "carries on business"
occurring in Section 20 (a) CPC. Such a defendant would have to be shown to be
a special agent exclusively working for his principal and for no other person
which may be in control of the principal. It was further held in Dhodha House
that only because the Defendant's goods have been sold at that place would
"evidently not mean that it carries on a business at that place."
22\. Learned counsel for Defendant No.2 contended that under Section 48 of the
Patents Act what is prohibited was "the act of making, using, offering for
sale, selling or importing for those purposes that product in India". Since,
Defendant No.2 did not sell DASTANIB in Delhi or have any subordinate office
there or any arrangement of special exclusive agency with Defendant No.3, this
Court did not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. He further
pointed out that the Defendant does not have any registration with the Delhi
VAT Department. It is submitted that there must be a substantial causal
connection of Defendant No.2 with the forum to bring the present action
against it. Reference is made to the decision in Graigola Merthyr Company
Limited v. Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Swansea [1928] Ch. 235 that in a
purely quia timet action the burden of proof resting on the plaintiff is far
heavier than in an action where an act has already been done and has already
caused actual damage. It is stated that in the cases of long arm jurisdiction,
the Court has to carry out a three part inquiry to determine whether a non-
resident has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum State to support the
exercise of limited personal jurisdiction. Reference is made to the decision
in Walter v. M Walter & Co., Inc. 446 N.W. 2d 507. It is stated that unlike
Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act and Section 134(2) CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012
Page 12 of 18 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which provide for long arm
jurisdiction, there is no corresponding provision in the Patents Act which can
be invoked by the Plaintiff for justifying the jurisdiction of this Court.
23\. As far as the above submissions are concerned, there can be no doubt that
in quia timet action the burden of proof on the Plaintiff is heavier than any
other cases where the threat of infringement has already been materialized. It
is also not in dispute that in cases of long-arm jurisdiction, as the present
one, the Plaintiff must have prima facie pleaded that the Defendant has
availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities; that the cause of
action arising from the Defendant's activities in the foreign state and that
the Defendant's activities must have a substantial connection with the foreign
state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendant. However, each
of the above tests would require evidence to be led since invariably it would
be a mixed question of law and fact. At the stage prior to the trial, where a
Defendant is in a quia timet action seeking the return of the plaint for want
of jurisdiction, the Court will have to take the allegation contained in the
plaint to be correct. In other words, the Court is not expected to examine the
written statements to test the veracity of the averments in the plaint. Also,
considering that in a quia timet action the averments in the plaint would
invariably express only an apprehension of an infringement, the Court can only
examine whether such apprehension is prima facie credible enough for
entertaining the suit, postponing the testing of the veracity of such averment
to the stage of trial.
24\. In M/s Jawahar Engineering Company v. Jawahar Engineers Pvt. Ltd.
CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 13 of 18
(1983) PTC 207, the Court was faced with a similar question under the Trade
and Merchandise Act 1958\. The learned Single Judge had held that the Delhi
Courts do not have the jurisdiction since no sale by the Defendant was shown
to have been made in Delhi. In reversing the said judgment, the Division Bench
explained that "when an injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the
threat should have become a reality before the injunction and it can even be
sought for a threat that is still to materialize. An injunction being
prohibitive in nature is intended to prevent something that is likely to
happen."
25\. In Mars Incorporated v. Kumar Krishna Mukherjee 2003 (26) PTC 60 (Del),
the Court discussed at some length the concept of quia timet action and
explained as under:
"21. To expect the aggrieved party to wait and watch for the opening of
business or manufacturing or sale or goods under the apprehended infringement
of trade mark is too much. A stitch in time always saves nine and that is what
is the essence of Quia Timet Action. With the onset of information technology
in modern times, registration of a website which is popularly known as domain
name, a party owning a website has a right to protect the same if any person
registers the website with a name which is inherently deceptive. In such cases
either party is directed to change the name of the site or handover to its
owner. On the same pattern and pedestal is the threatened or apprehended
invasion of the trade mark or corporate name."
26\. In Pfizer Products, Inc v. Rajesh Chopra 2006 (32) PTC 301, the Court
observed as under:
> "The other aspect of the matter is that a threat of selling the offending
> goods in Delhi would in itself confer jurisdiction in the courts in Delhi to
> entertain a suit claiming an injunction in respect thereof. Whether the
> threat perception is justified or not is another matter which has to be
> CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 14 of 18 considered and decided upon in the
> application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 or on merits
> when the suit is taken up for disposal. Insofar as Order 7 Rule 10 is
> concerned, assuming that whatever is stated in the plaint is correct, one
> would have to also assume that the threat or the intention of the defendants
> to sell and offer for sale the offending goods in Delhi is also correct.
> Therefore, if the threat exists then this court would certainly have
> jurisdiction to entertain the present suit."
27\. In the above decision, the learned Single Judge deferred the question as
to the correctness of the threat perception to the stage of trial, as it was
held to be a mixed question of law and fact. This was consistent with the
decision of the Division Bench in State Trading Corporation of India Limited
v. Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh 63(1996) DLT 971 which
inter alia held that "If the determination of jurisdiction of the Court is a
question of fact or mixed question of fact and law requiring evidence to be
adduced before recording a finding, the determination of the question may in
appropriate, cases be liable to be postponed till after the determination of
all or several other issues if the evidence to be adduced by the parties may
be common on the issue of jurisdiction and such other issues."
28\. Referring to the decisions in M/s Jawahar Engineering Company and Pfizer
Products Inc, another learned Single Judge of this Court in LG Electronics
India Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Bhogilal Patel 2012 (51) PTC 513 held as under:
"43. The said threat perception per se also cannot also be said to be acting
as an escape route to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts by just averring
so in the plaint. The judgments rendered in the Jawahar (supra) and Pfizer
(supra) as well as the observations made herein have to be read in the
context. The threats are accepted by the courts for the CS(OS) No. 2801 of
2012 Page 15 of 18 purposes of invocation of jurisdiction as a mixed question
of fact and law when there are some facts indicating towards likelihood of the
perfection of the said threats or furtherance of the threats becoming reality.
The said nexus of the initial facts will allow the court to determine the
likelihood aspect in such threat and will lead to the court drawing the
inference treating it as a mixed question of fact and law.
44\. Thus, the real test would be when the court seized of such a matter is
under doubt as to whether there is a possibility of threat becoming reality
though the possibility of the same not becoming the reality is also not ruled
out. In such cases, the question of jurisdiction on the basis of apprehension
becomes a mixed question of fact and law and the same is thus deferred until
the establishment of further facts in the trial."
29\. The above decisions are in line with the position in common law as
regards quia timet actions. Illustratively reference may be made to the recent
decision in Merck Sharp Dohme v. Teva Pharma B.V. (2012) EWHC 627 (Pat). In
the said case, the Defendant, Teva Pharma, obtained the market authorization
for a drug. It was held that while the obtaining of such market authorization
could not itself be constituted an infringement, "application for a market
authorization is not a trivial matter and is the product of careful planning
and work." It was held that such obtaining of market authorization provided "a
concrete basis for inference that TEVA threaten and intend to sell efavirenz
sometime."
30\. Turning to the case on hand, para 36 of the plaint first expresses the
apprehension that Defendants 1 and 2 are in the process of manufacturing
DASATINIB (API) and are seeking to sell or offer for sale the said product to
various generic pharmaceutical companies in India but not limited to Defendant
No.3. Secondly, it has been pleaded in para 40 that Defendant CS(OS) No. 2801
of 2012 Page 16 of 18 No.2 intends to supply API to various generic
manufacturers in India and abroad. Thirdly, in para 41(1), it has been averred
that Defendants 1 and 2 have numerous commercial arrangements by virtue of
which they supply bulk API especially oncology APIs to various generic
companies located within the jurisdiction of this Court. The fourth averment
is in para 41(2) where it is stated that "if Defendant Nos.1 & 2 start
supplying, DASATINIB (API), the same would be available within the
jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court."
31\. It is not necessary at this stage, for the Plaintiff to name the
particular customers of Defendants 1 and 2 to whom the product is to be sold
since what is expressed is only an apprehension of "offer for sale". At this
stage, the Plaintiff can at best refer to the fact that Defendant 2 supplies
oncology APIs to various generic companies and that the said APIs are sold in
Delhi. The apprehension that such oncology APIs may in the near future include
the infringing product which is also an oncology API cannot, in the
circumstances, be characterised as lacking credibility and having been
asserted merely to attract the jurisdiction of the Court. The above averments
in the present plaint, which is in a quia timet action, are prima facie
sufficient to show that Defendant No.2 "carries on business" in Delhi and that
the prima facie the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction of this
Court.
32\. Needless to clarify that the final determination on whether the Court has
territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit will have to await the
completion of the trial as it is a mixed question of law and fact. On the
basis of the CS(OS) No. 2801 of 2012 Page 17 of 18 averment in the plaint at
this stage it is not necessary for the Court to, and in fact it cannot,
conclusively hold that this Court either has or lacks the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
33\. In that view of the matter, this application is dismissed. However, a
specific issue concerning territorial jurisdiction of the Court will be framed
for determination at the appropriate stage.
