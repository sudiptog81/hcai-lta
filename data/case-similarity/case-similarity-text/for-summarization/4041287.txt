               25.4.2009
                       Pr.            Complainant Naresh Dhall is present in person with counsel Mr. Rakesh 
                                      Chaudhary, Adv.
                                      Convict Lallan Singh is present with counsel Mr. Mohit Sharma, Mr. R.P. 
                                      Srivastava, Advocates.
                     1.
Convict has been found guilty for the offence u/s.138 of N.I. Act by this
directed to pay compensation to the complainant u/s.357(3) of Cr.PC. The
cheque in question is dated 15.10.2008, which was dishonoured i.e. more than
six months time has been passed from the date of cheque. Besides this, the
complainant must have incurred some expenses in prosecution of this complaint
and it must have also led to unnecessary harassment. Therefore, in my
considered view, convict shall pay a compensation amount of Rs.2,25,000/­
u/s.357(3) of Cr.PC within 30 days from the last day of appeal, failing which,
the convict shall be liable for a further imprisonment for a period of three
months S.I. In the case of Hari Singh Vs. Sukhbir Singh, 1988(4)SCC 511 and
also in the case of Suganthi Suresh Kumar Vs. Jagdishan, 2002 Cr.LJ 1003=2002
AIR SC 681, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that In default of compensation,
imprisonment can be ordered.
5\. The earlier personal bond/surety bond of the convict are cancelled. He is
ordered to be taken into custody for serving of the sentence. Copy of the
judgement and sentence be supplied to the convict free of cost immediately.
6\. Convict is ordered to be taken into custody to undergo to the sentence.
Convict has been found guilty for the offence u/s.138 of N.I. Act by this
Court vide judgement dated 18.4.2009.
2\. Arguments on sentence heard. Ld. Counsel for the convict requests for a
lenient view on the ground that the convict is is a poor person and he has
three minor children who all are dependent on him and also mother of convict
is residing with him. On this ground, it is claimed that a lenient view may be
taken against the convict and he be enlarged on probation.
3\. In this case, the convict has been found guilty for the dishonour of
cheque for an amount of Rs.1,98,000/­. There is no previous conviction of the
convict brought to the knowledge of this Court. Keeping in view all the facts
and circumstances and the grounds taken by the counsel for convict for a
lenient view, in my considered view, following punishment shall meet the ends
of justice. Request of probation is declined since cases of dishonour of
cheque are on the rise drastically. The functioning of the criminal Courts in
Delhi, is literally crumbled by the rise of such cases. As per an estimate, in
Delhi out of 7.5 lacs criminal cases, around 4.5 lacs cases are only
pertaining to dishonour of cheque. Sufficient deterrent punishment needs to be
given in such offences which can act as deterrent not only to the convict, but
also to other offenders. In the case of Suganthi Suresh Kumar Vs. Jagdishan,

it is held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that adequate punishment needs to be given
in the cases of dishonour of cheque and grossly inadequate punishment is
improper.
4\. Accordingly, the convict is sentenced to a period of one year S.I. No fine
is imposed. Besides imprisonment of one year S.I., the convict is also
directed to pay compensation to the complainant u/s.357(3) of Cr.PC. The

complainant must have incurred some expenses in prosecution of this complaint
and it must have also led to unnecessary harassment. Therefore, in my

the convict shall be liable for a further imprisonment for a period of three
