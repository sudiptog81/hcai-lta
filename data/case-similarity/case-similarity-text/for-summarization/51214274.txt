The present appellants were impleaded as Defendants/ Respondents in the Suit
No. 742 of 2016 which was filed by the plaintiff Company - Mandev Tubes Pvt.

design and alleging infringement and passing off.
Commercial Suit No. 742 of 2016 was filed by the Private Limited Company i.e.
Mandev Tubes Pvt. Ltd., having its registered office at Mumbai, claiming that
it manufacture / sells metal / copper tubes with diversified use and are often
employed in household air-conditioning, medical gas delivery pipelines and
indoor plumbing. It is the case of the plaintiff- company in the suit,
mentioned above, that it is engaged in the business of manufacturing,
supplying and distributing the copper tubes for the last 45 years and during
this period, it had developed a substantial goodwill and enjoys a sufficient
reputation in the copper tube industry. The plaintiff gave details of its
clientel, which included several companies and reputed institutions like
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre to Sigma Meditech Services Pvt. Ltd. etc..
According to the plaintiff, it conceived of a unique, novel and original shape
and configuration for its tubes and the uniqueness and Borey 3/47  :::

comapeal-133-17R.doc novelty in its design lies in one end of the tube,
possessing an expanded bell-shaped like ending and that it conceived of such a
shape, as it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Pursuant to such
configuration, the plaintiff had applied for registration of this novel and
original design under the Designs Act, 2000 and on 4th March, 2010, the
concerned Registrar issued a certificate of registration in favour of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff had placed on record the said registration
certificate in relation to Design No. 224751 and the respective representation
sheets, which have described the designs in the following manner.
FRONT/ BACK VIEW | TOP / BOTTOM VIEW "Novelty resides in the shape and
configuration of the "METAL TUBE" particularly in the portions marked as "a" &
"b" in Sheet No. 1 as illustrated. No claim is made by virtue of this
registration in respect of any Mechanical or other action of the Mechanism,
what so ever, or in respect of any mode or Principle of Construction of the
Article. No claim is made in respect of descriptive matter, words, letters,
Trade Mark, colour or Colour Combination and numerals as appearing in the

No claim is made in respect of extraneous matter, which is not forming the
integral part of the Design." 2 In the suit, it is the claim of plaintiff that
pursuant to the said registration, the plaintiff applied its unique and novel
design to the copper tubes manufactured by it and those copper tubes were
marketed and sold under the trademarks "MT ECO SELF CONNECT" and "MT MEDI SELF
CONNECT PLUS". The plaintiff promoted/ advertised its product extensively and
acquired a good market through various industry magazines and due to the said
advertisement, it had generated enormous sales and that the plaintiff was able
to capture a significant market share. According to the plaintiff in or about
February, 2015, the plaintiff learnt from trade sources that there was a
fraudulent and obvious imitation of their product being sold in the market and
on an enquiry, it was revealed by the plaintiff that these goods were marketed
in uncanny resemblance to that of the plaintiff's self connect tubes and the
deception was apparent to the eye. The plaintiff Borey 5/47  ::: Uploaded on -
21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/
comapeal-133-17R.doc learnt that one - Hariom Metal and Tubes i.e. the
defendant no.1, was manufacturing the said tubes which infringed the
plaintiff's rights. Resultantly, the plaintiff issued notice through his
counsel to the defendant no.1, who is appellant before us in this appeal,
asking / directing the defendant to cease and desist from infringing its
registered designs and passing off as the plaintiff's self connect tubes.
Defendant no. 1 denied the claim of the plaintiff and informed the plaintiff
that it had obtained the registration in respect of its product. 3 The
plaintiff was aggrieved by the said act of the defendants and claimed that the
"differences" sought to be emphasized by the defendant are trivial and
meaningless and a close comparison of the products revealed that the defendant
had copied the essential feature of the Plaintiff's design in the expanded
bell-shaped ending. According to the plaintiff, deception is further
aggravated by the use of identical colour for the caps used on the defendant's
tubes. The plaintiff also moved an application for cancelling / rectifying the
defendant Borey 6/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on -

before the Controller of Designs, Kolkata and the said proceedings are
pending. Left with no other effective remedy, the plaintiff filed the suit,
claiming that the defendants have infringed the designs of the plaintiff and
deceptively similar tubes manufactured by the defendants are being sold
through the stockist market. The plaintiff had placed on record the evidence
to that effect including the dealers invoices and delivery challan, depicting
the pictures of the goods purchased under the said invoice. The plaintiff,
thus was aggrieved by the unlawful and illegal manufacturing and about the
supply and sale of the infringed copper tubes by the defendants and was also
aggrieved and apprehensive of the irreparable loss and injury being caused to
the goodwill of the business of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore,
prayed for a perpetual order and injunction, restraining the defendants from
infringing in any manner the plaintiff's registered design and in any manner
passing off of its design and tubes as those of the plaintiff. The plaintiff
prayed for a decree in its favour and against the defendants Borey 7/47  :::

alleged act of infringement and passing off on the part of the defendants. The
plaintiff also sought a temporary order of injunction, restraining the
defendants from infringing the plaintiff's registered designs during the
pendency of the said suit.
4 A Notice of Motion No. 2195 of 2016 was taken out by the plaintiff in the
aforesaid suit, praying for grant of temporary order and injunction,
restraining the defendants from infringing in any manner the plaintiff's
registered designs, but not limited to the sale of the infringing copper tubes
or any other deceptively similar designs. By the said notice of motion, the
plaintiff also sought a temporary order, appointing the court receiver to
visit the defendant's factory and to take inspection and make inventory of the
goods lying therein which infringed the plaintiff's registered design or
passing them off, as they are deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff.

             5                 In   response   to   the   said   Notice   of   Motion,   the 
defendants (present appellants) filed their reply, alleging that that the suit
was an abuse of process of law and had been filed with an attempt to stall the
business of the defendants. The appellants (original defendants) invited
attention to the notice of motion which was earlier filed by the plaintiff in
suit no. 143 of 2016, claiming the identical reliefs, and set out the details
of the said proceedings. The defendants sought dismissal of the suit filed by
the plaintiff under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code for lack of
jurisdiction. The said notice of motion was also opposed on the ground that
the defendants had invented a new design on their own and the novelty,
configuration and ornamentation in its appearance and other interior linings
and intellectual acts and accordingly, the entire design is the brain child of
their hard, creative work and efforts in bringing the impugned design into
existence. The defendants have also filed an application and obtained
registration certificate for the said design and they are the registered
proprietor of the said design. The Borey 9/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018

defendants attempted to distinguish the product of the plaintiff by giving
description of their product in paragraph 8
(d) of their reply at page 51 of the paper book, which is reproduced as under
:
> "8 (d) It is submitted that the Defendants product is a copper tube and

6 Another defence was taken by the defendants in the reply by contending that
the plaintiff had obtained the registration of the said design by misleading
the Controller of Designs and it was alleged that the plaintiff did not
disclose to the Registrar that the said design applied by him is prior known
and published design and the product was not novel, still the registration was
procured. The defendants, therefore, raised a plea by placing reliance on
section 19(b) and (c) of the Designs Act, 2000, by alleging that the design of
the plaintiff's product was published prior to the registration and that in
terms of section 19 of the Designs Act, 2000, the Borey 11/47  ::: Uploaded on

comapeal-133-17R.doc registration of the plaintiff is required to be
cancelled. Thus the defendants opposed the notice of motion. 7 The said notice
of motion was heard by the learned single Judge. The learned single Judge
allowed the notice of motion in terms of prayer clauses (a), (b) and (c) and
also directed the court Receiver to make an inventory of the invented goods in
the defendants premises and issued direction to sell them.
The learned single Judge considered the claim of the plaintiff and also the
Say of the defendants, as set out in the reply to the notice of motion and
then made reference to the relevant provisions in the Designs Act, 2000. The
learned single Judge recorded a finding that no doubt the design has been
applied to the copper tubes manufactured by the plaintiff and the learned
single Judge also took a note of the fact that plaintiff's sale was in excess
of Rs. 4.33 crores and took into account the statement of sale and expenses
for the period of 2014-2015. As regards the question of similarity, Borey

::: spb/ comapeal-133-17R.doc the learned single Judge concluded that there
was no "difference", though in the affidavit in the Notice of Motion, the
defendants had claimed that the curvature of the bell-ending in the
plaintiff's product is of 90 degrees; whereas in the case of the defendants'
product is at 45 degrees. The learned single Judge was of the opinion that the
distinction is without difference. The learned single Judge was not impressed
by the minute distinction and did not take into consideration the defences
raised in the suit about the invoices placed on record by the plaintiff, which
were attempted to be falsified by the defendants by filing the affidavit from
the company, who had issued the invoices that they are forged and are not
invoices in reality. The learned single Judge also took note of the fact that
the defendants had connection with the plaintiff and in fact defendant nos. 2
and 3 worked for the plaintiff after registration of the plaintiff's design in
the suit, and the defendant no. 1 was in fact the Production Manager of the
plaintiff and defendant no.3 was In-charge of the marketing. On the basis of
the entire discussion, the learned single Judge Borey 13/47  ::: Uploaded on -
21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/
comapeal-133-17R.doc recorded a finding that prima faice, it appears that the
defendants had done nothing but pirated the plaintiff's design. As regards the
question of passing off, the learned single Judge noted that by the time the
plaintiff's claimed to have entered the market their sales was in excess of
Rs. 4.31 crores.
The learned single Judge had an opportunity to have a look at the samples of
the two products placed before him and recorded a finding that he was not able
to notice any difference nor was able to identify as to which product belong
to whom. He proceeds to record a finding that applying the ultimate test, the
court looking at the rival products is of the opinion that for the purposes of
design, infringement and passing off was sufficient. As regards the defence of
functionality to the design, the learned single Judge rejected it outright.
Since the plaintiff had claimed no exclusivity in any functional element and
it was observed by the learned single Judge that only exclusivity claimed is
in the Borey 14/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on -

whimsicality of design, which made the design both novel and original. Further
the learned single Judge also concluded that there was no material to show
prior publication or lack of novelty. In these circumstances, the learned
single Judge was impressed by the fact that there is an undeniable novelty and
originality to the plaintiff's design and, since no functionality was
demonstrated by either side, nor the plaintiff claimed any rights to any
functionality and in absence of defendants, being unable to show any use by
them or anybody else prior to the plaintiff, the plaintiff was found to have
made a prima facie case. The learned single Judge found the balance of
convenience in favour of the plaintiff and expressed that an irreparable
prejudice would be caused if the injunction is refused. In these
circumstances, by the impugned order dated 06.12.2016, the learned single
Judge was pleased to allow the notice of motion and made it absolute.
8 It is this order, which is impugned in the present appeal.

             9                 The question that falls for our consideration in the 
present appeal is whether the order passed by the learned single Judge can be
sustained within the framework of the Designs Act, 2000 and whether the
finding recorded by the learned single Judge, holding a prima facie case in
favour of the plaintiff and allowing the notice of motion, can be faulted
with.
10 It would be appropriate to refer to certain provisions of the Designs Act,
2000. The Designs Act, 2000 is an act to consolidate and amend the law
relating to protection of designs. The said Act defines the term "design" in
section 2 clause (d) as under :
> "S.2 (d) "design" means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern,

11 We have to examine the present case in the light of the aforesaid scheme of
the Designs Act, 2000. The defendant in present Appeal (original plaintiff)
has obtained registration in respect of design which according to him is an
unique, novel and original for its tubes. According to the him the uniqueness
and novelty in its design for copper tubes lies in one end of the tube
possessing an expanded bell-shaped ending. The plaintiff did not rely on the
functionality of the designs but according to the plaintiff the said shape was
conceived since it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It is with this
design, the plaintiff approached the Controller of Designs and obtained its
trade- mark and obtained a Borey 20/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 :::
Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/ comapeal-133-17R.doc
certification of registration on 17.9.2009. The design has been registered in
view of its novelty in its shape and configuration and particularly in the
portion marked as "a" and "b" so depicted in the "representation sheet". The
plaintiff did not make any claim in respect of the description, importance of
words "trade-marks, colour or colour combination or numerical" appearing for
the design. The plaintiff harps on the shape and configuration of the copper
tubes and specially expanded bell-shape like ending it at one end of the tube.
Perusal of the definition of "design" in the enactment, admits the "design" of
the plaintiff in the copper tubes since under the Designs Act, 2000, the term
"design" means the features of shape, configuration, pattern, by any
industrial process or means, whether manual, mechanical or chemical, separate
or combined in the finished article and or one which appeal to and are judged
solely by the eye.

             12                The learned counsel for the appellants Mr. Rashmin 
Khandekar, who prayed for setting aside of the order passed by the learned
single Judge, would argue that the registration under the Designs Act, 2000 is
not conclusive. He would also argue that by virtue of provisions contained
under section 22(3) of the Designs Act, the defendants could plead every
ground available under section 19, as a ground of defence in a suit or
proceedings for relief. According to the learned counsel, the appellants had
already approached the Competent Authority for cancellation of the
registration granted in favour of the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the
appellants would vehemently argue that the defences taken in response to the
suit of the plaintiff are premised on section 19 which pertains to
cancellation of the registration and any person interested may present the
petition for cancellation of the registration of design at any time after its
registration, to the Controller on the grounds mentioned in section 19 and
each of the grounds from (a) to (c), according to the learned counsel, are
independent and separate defences available to Borey 22/47  ::: Uploaded on -
21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/
comapeal-133-17R.doc the defendants. Shri Khandekar would argue that the
appellants have raised all the defences and he specifically pressed the
defence under section 19(1)(e), namely that the design of the plaintiff is not
a design as defined under clause
(d) of section 2 and according to him the design which is being sought to be
enforced by the plaintiff would grossly fail to stand the test of section
2(d). According to Shri Khandekar, essential ingredients of the design would
feature shape, configuration, pattern etc.., which would appeal to and are
judged solely by the eye. According to the learned counsel this would exclude
any mode or principle of construction or anything which is in substance a mere
mechanical device. Shri Khandekar would argue that the requirement of visual
appeal, which has to be solely judged by the ocular test and according to him
if there is no visual appeal, the enquiry ends there. He also laid emphasis on
the principle that a visual appeal is required to be judged by the court,
keeping in mind the customer of the article, who puts the design to use.
According to him, the design of the plaintiff namely, copper Borey 23/47  :::
Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/
comapeal-133-17R.doc pipes lack visual appeal of whatsoever nature. He would
argue that it is even more apparent when one considers the customer of the
pipes in question being manufactures of air conditioner, namely, electrical
or/and plumbing, which would not consider anything distinctive whatsoever
about the said pipe, as being distinctive or having a visual appeal. He would
argue that the design claimed by the plaintiff is not something which is
significantly distinguishable from known designs since it is a pipe which is
to be used in air-conditioning, medical gas pipelines system and indoor
plumbing useful in transmitting air, electricity etc.. According to the
learned counsel to depict other defences available under section 19, namely
prior publication and lack of novelty, the appellant had sufficient material.
Further, the counsel for the appellant concedes that unfortunately the said
material was not placed before the trial court. However, he was armed with the
material which would demonstrate that the design of the plaintiff is hit by
the case of prior publication and lack of novelty/originality and the
plaintiff had suppressed the prior Borey 24/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018

publication on its own accord as back as in November / December, 2008. The
learned counsel would argue that the material sought to be relied upon, ought
to be allowed under Order 41, Rule 27 of the CPC, since this is a case of
infringement and passing off and public interest is at stake. He placed
reliance on the judgment in the case of APL Apollo Tubes Ltd. vs. Surya Roshni
Limited, reported in 2011 (5) Bom. C.R 456. He also placed reliance on the
judgment in the case of AMP Incorporated vs. Utilux Proprietary Ltd., reported
in 1972 (5) R.P.C. 103 (judgment of House of Lords). Reliance is also placed
on the judgment in the case of Maya Appliances Pvt. Ltd., Chennai & Ors. vs.
Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances Ltd., (Madras High Court), reported in MIPR

             13                Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents 
Shri Rohan Kadam, who has supported the order passed by the learned single
Judge, emphasized on the object of the Designs Act, 2000 and he would argue
that the purpose of the Act is to protect the intellectual property right of
the original design for a period of 10 years and to benefit a person for his
research and labour put in by him to evolve a new and original design.
According to Shri Kadam his clients were already engaged in manufacturing of
copper tubes for diverse and varied applications including household air
conditioning, medical gas pipelines and indoor plumbing etc.. According to
Shri Kadam, the plaintiff conceived of a unique, novel and original shape and
configuration for its tubes and the uniqueness and novelty in its design lied
in one end of the tube possessing and expanded bell-shape like ending and this
shape was conceived since it was thought to be aesthetically pleasing to the
eye. According to Shri Kadam, since the design was original and new and not
being available in the country, it had obtained a registration on the said
design, which entail Borey 26/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded
on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/ comapeal-133-17R.doc the consequences of
conferring a copy- right of the design on his client during 10 years from the
date of the registration or for further extendable dates. According to Shri
Kadam on such registration being obtained, he enjoyed the protection of his
intellectual property right and his claim of exclusivity in the design of the
copper tube and the use of the said design conceived by the plaintiff, by the
defendants is an infringement of his right by reproducing the same design and
manufacturing the tubes, which were deceptively similar to that of the
plaintiff and marketing the same, resulted in passing them off as defendants'
product. Shri Kadam would argue that once the design has been registered, it
is deemed to be an original design, which has not been disclosed to the public
any where in India or in any other country by publication in tangible form or
by using any way prior to the date of the application for registration.
According to Shri Kadam the burden to show that the design was not original or
was not new, was on the defendants and it is to be Borey 27/47  ::: Uploaded

entitled for registration under the Designs Act, 2000. 14 Learned counsel Shri
Kadam has also invited our attention to the material placed on record in
relation to the design applied by the respondent no.1- Kalpesh R. Jain, who
was employed by the plaintiff in the past to transport its goods by a lorry
and according to Shri Kadam, in view of this relationship, he had ample access
to the manufacturing work of the plaintiff and was provided with the modes and
methods while applying to the registration of his product. Shri Kadam in
support of his arguments relied upon following four judgments i.e. :

             15                We have perused the material placed on record by 
> the appellants and the respondent (original plaintiff) and also the impugned
> judgment delivered by the learned single Judge.
The appellants have placed on record the design on which the plaintiff /
present respondent has obtained registration and has also annexed the pictures
of the plaintiff's self connect tubes, upon which the registration was
granted. The appellant has also placed on record his own product and images of
the product and side-by-side comparison of the Respondent's product. We also
had an opportunity of having glimpse of the product of the appellants and the
respondent/original plaintiff. The learned single judge has rightly observed
that when both these two products were placed before him, he was not able to
spot any difference with his naked eyes and an attempt on our part also
resulted into the same conclusion, namely, we could not find any material
difference in the two products. Though the learned Advocate Shri Kadam for the
respondent / Borey 29/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on -
22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/ comapeal-133-17R.doc plaintiff insisted upon the
uniqueness in its design and its novel shape and emphasized that the tubes of
his client has expansion of 90 degree; whereas that of the appellants/
defendants which was edged 45 degrees. Another distinction, according to Shri
Kadam is the smoothness of the outer and inner surface of the expansion in the
product of his client; whereas roughness of the inner and outer surface of the
respondent tubes expansion. However, we are unable to spot such a difference
and we could only observe that the product of the plaintiff has been
reproduced by the defendants. The matter on the representation sheet presented
by the appellant (original defendant), on which registration has been
obtained, reveals that novelty to the design resides in the shape and
configuration of the metal tube of airs and this distinction is represented in
the front rear top side perspective view of the product of the appellant. The
design the original plaintiff posed, on which the registration has been
granted is in the form i.e. in the shape and configuration of the metal tube
particularly in the portions marked as 'a' and 'b' in the Borey 30/47  :::

comapeal-133-17R.doc representation sheets and the portion 'b' is a expanded
bell- shape and it is this design on which the registration has been granted.
We are conscious of the fact that the defendants in the defence have posed a
challenge to the registration of the design of the plaintiff, which they are
permitted to do by virtue of section 22 (3) of the Designs Act, 2000 and the
defendants by way of defence have taken a ground that the design of the
plaintiff is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2, as it
lacks appeal to the eye and cannot be so recognized. Whether the design of the
original plaintiff is lacking in novelty or originality is not to be judged at
this stage since the appellant had not produced any material before the
learned trial Judge so as to enable the trial Judge to appreciate the said
contention. The original plaintiff in suit had not put a case, claiming
exclusivity of the functional element in the design and the only exclusivity
claimed by the plaintiff is in the capriciousness or whimsicality of design
and it is the claim of the plaintiff that it is this element in the design
which makes it both novel and original. Here it is an attempt on behalf of

01:57:55 ::: spb/ comapeal-133-17R.doc the appellants to canvass that the
features which are to be found in the finished article must appeal and or
judged solely by the eye in order to satisfy that it falls within the
definition of design and the visual appeal by an eye is the eye of the
customer. Since the pipes are to be used inside the air- conditioning, the
appearance of the article must be relevant factor and the test is not to be
applied by taking into consideration the eye of the person, who is going to
put and use those tubes/pipes, which are to be put in the air- conditioners
and the choice must be only because of the shape / configuration. It may be
because of the fact that they would more fruitfully serve the purpose and they
would be more functional.
16 The claim of the original plaintiff in the suit is about the uniqueness of
its design applied to copper tubes and the registration was granted on this
design. The protection which the plaintiff had claimed in the suit was the
protection of his new or original design with reference to the copper Borey

design is that a particular figure / shape conceived by its designer, in his
mind and it is reproduced in some identifiable manner and is sought to be
applied to an article. Whenever any registration is sought for, a
configuration has to be chosen for registration to be reproduced in any
article. The original plaintiff had approached the court, seeking injunction
and sought protection of his design applied to copper tubes. It is not the
case of the plaintiff that the copper tubes were in existence earlier or were
put to the use the way they are being put to use including its use in air-
conditioner but the plaintiff came up with a design which he claimed to be a
new and original and as per the plaintiff, it was already manufacturing the
copper tubes with varied applications for a considerable long time but in the
year 2009 it conceived of a unique, novel shape, configuration for its tubes
and applied this uniqueness and novelty on copper tubes and this uniqueness
lied in the expanded bell-shaped ending to the copper tube. It is this idea

Court has observed in case of Bharat Glass Tube Ltd., vs. Gopal Glass Works
Ltd., reported in 2008 (10) Supreme Court Cases 657 in paragraphs 36 and 37 in
the following words :
> "36. Similarly our attention was also invited to para 27.07 of the law of

A design capable of registration cannot consist of a mere conception of the
features mentioned in the definition, or in the case of an article in three
dimensions, of a representation of such features in two Borey 34/47  :::

with the definition, consist of the features as they appear in the article to
which they have been applied by some industrial process or means. An applicant
for registration of a design has to produce a pictorial illustration of the
idea or suggestion which he has to establish as new or original;"
Therefore, the concept of design is that a particular figure conceived by its
designer in his mind and it is reproduced in some identifiable manner and it
is sought to be applied to an article. therefore, whenever registration is
required then those configuration has to be chosen for registration to be
reproduced in any article. The idea is that the design has to be registered
which is sought to be reproduced on any article. therefore, both the things
are required to go together, i.e. the design and the design which is to be
applied to an article."
"37 In the present case, the design has been reproduced in the article like
glass which is registered. This could have been registered with rexin or
leather. therefore, for registration of a particular configuration or
particular shape of thing which is sought to be reproduced on a particular
article has to be applied. As in the present case the design sought to be
reproduced on a glass-sheet has been registered and there is no evidence to
show that this design was registered earlier to be reproduced on glass in
India or any other part of the country or in Germany or even for that matter
in United Kingdom, therefore, it is for the first time registered in India
which is new and original design which is to be reproduced on glass sheet.
therefore, the submission of learned senior counsel for the appellant, Mr.
Gupta cannot be accepted that this design was not new and original."

defendants on record showing any prior publication or lack of novelty. The
defendant had sought to raise the defences permissible under section 19 of the
Designs Act, alleging that the design is not new or original and it was not
entitled to be registered. It is to be noted that the plaintiff is not
claiming to be an inventor of the copper tubes with multiple use but he is
claiming exclusivity in the capriciousness or whimsicality of the design. Even
the defendant, who is in the process of manufacturing of the copper tubes, has
applied the design to the tubes and obtained registration by claiming it to be
exclusively his. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff's had obtained
registration of his design on 04.10.2010 and since then he is applying the
design to the copper tubes manufactured by it. The Borey 36/47  ::: Uploaded

comapeal-133-17R.doc contention of the present appellants is that the
plaintiff could not have claimed any exclusivity in the design. That is not
sustainable in view of the fact that appellant himself also applied a shape

subsequent in point of time to that of the plaintiff. It is the plaintiff, who
had approached the Civil Court by filing a suit, claiming protection of his
design since according to the plaintiff, it was the defendant, who was a part

off the plaintiff's registered design as applied to the copper tubes.
We are not able to accept the contention raised by the present appellants that
there was no uniqueness in the design of the plaintiff and he had taken

             18                The   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants     placed 
heavy reliance on the judgment of House of Lords in the case of AMP
Incorporated, cited supra, to demonstrate the functionality aspect of a
design. He specifically relies upon the following paragraph at page 106 of the
said judgment :
> "In deciding whether features are "dictated solely by function" the word
> "features" does not merely mean "parts" but further includes the shapes of
> the parts. If there is any feature not necessary to perform the functions
> the design is valid since a designer has freedom of choice. The exclusion is
> a narrow one;
Stenor v. Whitesides (1948) 65 R.P.C. 1: it applies only if there is in effect
a monopoly of the function. In the design in suit there are a number of
features which can be varied without there being failure to perform the
function. The defendants should not be allowed to copy the design in suit when
they can perform the function required without copying. The history of the
legislation on registered designs shows that only the first Registered Designs
Act (of 1842) was concerned merely with matters of ornament. Since 1843 the
definition of "design" has extended beyond Borey 39/47  ::: Uploaded on -
21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 01:57:55 ::: spb/
comapeal-133-17R.doc "ornamental" designs and the courts have not been
troubled with matters of "eye appeal", nor was this matter an issue in Stenor
v. Whitesides (supra). Enquiries into the motive or intention of the designer
are equally undesirable and would cause great difficulty in practice. There is
no justification for a conclusion that a new and original design for any
article should be denied protection under the Act in circumstances when others
are free to fulfil the market in the article without being forced to copy it,
nor that others should in such a case be free to copy such a design with
impunity.".
We have noted the said judgment of the House of Lords but fail to understand
as to how it supports the appellants. The House of Lords in fact recognized
the principle that the registered design which consists of sketches of the
terminal from different angles with the statement "the novelty resides in the
shape or configuration of the article as shown in the representations" and it
takes note of the definition of the word "design" and the House of Lords
accepted the principle that the words "judged solely by the eye", must be
intended to Borey 40/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on -

customer might choose an article of that shape not because of its appearance
but because, he thought that the shape made it more useful to him. However,
the plaintiff in the suit has not claimed any functionality in his design, as
we do not find that in designs of the bell-shape ending of the tube, the
copper tubes which are used by the plaintiff in the air-conditioners or in any
other electrical instruments, cannot serve its purpose but it is the aesthetic
sense of the design, which the plaintiff has admitted that he has conceived.
19 The Judgment relied on behalf of the Appellants by Advocate Shri Khandekar
in the case of APL Apollo Tubes Ltd., cited supra, of the Delhi High Court, is
distinguishable on facts since the defendant therein, in the written
statement, had averred that the impugned design's registrations have been
obtained by the plaintiff in respect of pre-published designs and the defence
was premised on the existence of prior art in respect of the designs in
question. It was also the Borey 41/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 :::

forth that identical frames were easily available in the wooden form / shape
and on account of the scarcity of the wood, innovations were done to replace
the wood with concrete and metal for manufacturing of door frames and the
defendant had set out the details of the manufacturers / dealers, who have
been operating since 1962 and are dealing in hollow metal door frames. Thus
the defence was based on the material placed before the court and use of the
design of the plaintiff was prior in point of time and, therefore, the whole
judgment proceeds on granting relief on the premise that the defendant had
sufficiently established that the design of the plaintiff was not original but
was infested by existence of the prior art.
In any case, the present appellants have sufficient opportunity to demonstrate
during the course of the proceedings in the suit and demolish the case of the
plaintiff by rendering sufficient evidence before the court to demonstrate his
defence that the plaintiff's registration of design is liable to be cancelled
on account of the grounds available under Borey 42/47  ::: Uploaded on -

that the design is not new or original and/or that it is not the design as
defined under section (d) of section 2 of the Act. At present, we are called
upon only to examine the order/ judgment passed by the learned single Judge on
06.12.2016 in the notice of motion and the learned single Judge, after taking
into consideration the prima facie case and after recording the conduct of the
defendants, in not producing any material to demonstrate that the plaintiff's
design lacked novelty, arrived at a conclusion that the defendants had done
nothing but pirated the plaintiff's design and as regards passing off also,
the learned single Judge has recorded that by the time the defendant claims to
have entered the market, the sale of the plaintiff was already in excess of
Rs. 4.31 corers. In such circumstances, considering the fact that the judgment
delivered by the learned single Judge is on a Notice of Motion and since all
the parameters for grant of injunction in favour of the plaintiff were
satisfied by the plaintiff in the suit, no fault can be found with the order/
judgment passed by Borey 43/47  ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on

We are not convinced by the arguments advanced by Shri Khandekar to disturb
the said findings at the stage of Notice of Motion. More so, considering the
fact that the plaintiff was first in point of time to obtain the registration
and the defendants had started manufacturing the said pipes/tubes, on their
own showing, subsequent to that of the plaintiff.
Reliance placed by Shri Kadam on the judgment of this court in the case of
Whirlpool of India, cited supra, is aptly applicable to the case in hand,
where the learned single Judge rejected the contention of the defendant in
regard to the lack of novelty. The Hon'ble learned single Judge of this court
(Coram : S.J. Kathawalla, J.) in paragraph 42 of the judgment observed thus :
> "42. As held by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court (Coram : Mohit
> Shah, C.J. & Jamdar, J) in Asian Rubber Industries Ltd., Vs. Jasco Rubber, a
> Defendant who claims that its design has novelty cannot then contend that

> both the submissions are untenable and cannot be accepted."
We have noted the fact that the defendant himself has obtained registration of
his design in form "tubes for air" on 01.09.2014 and he claims exclusivity in
the said design. In fact, when the design of the appellant is registered,
copper tubes were already in vogue and being put to use and still he was able
to obtain an registration of his design, which according to him, is novel. The
appellant alleges that the plaintiff's design is not entitled to be registered
since there was a prior work in existence. If it is so, then the defendant's
work was also not liable to be registered since definitely at that time the
plaintiff's design was already registered, Borey 45/47  ::: Uploaded on -

and was well-known to the public at large. It would be useful to refer to para
nos. 17 and 18 of the judgment of the Division Bench of this High Court (Coram
: Mohit S.Shah, C.J. & Ranjit More, J.) in the case of Asian Rubber
Industries, New Delhi, vs. Jasco Rubber, Calicut, where the court observed in
the said paragraphs as under :
