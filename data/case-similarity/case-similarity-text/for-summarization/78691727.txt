PER SHAMIM YAHYA: AM This appeal by the Assessee is directed against the order
of the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) dated 05.10.2010 and pertains
to assessment year 2006-07.
2\. The effective issue raised is that Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) erred in passing the assessment order u/s 143(3) read with section
144C of the IT Act. It has been urged that Assessing Officer /DRP has erred in
making the addition of ` 10,40,75,727/- to the income of the assessee on
account of adjustment in the Arms Length Price of international transaction
entered by the assessee with associated enterprise. It has been urged that
TPO/Assessing Officer has erred by accepting companies earning super normal
profits.

ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010
3\. The brief facts of the case are that the assessee Adobe Systems India
Private Limited (hereinafter called Adobe India or the Assessee) is a wholly
and subsidiary of Adobe Systems Inc., USA. It is engaged in providing software
development services and marketing support services to its associated
enterprises. The TPO in this case noted that the assessee company is showing
OP/Cost Margin of 14.96% which he considered to be quite low, as compared to
other companies which are engaged in similar IT fields. The TPO in this case
passed a Transfer Pricing order making a upward adjustment of ` 10,40,75,727/-
on the arms length price of the international transactions. The TPO had worked
out the average of arithmetic mean of ALP (OP/OC) of 42 comparables at the
average of 24.91 percent. The Arm's Length Price of international transaction
was determined as under:-
         "Operating Revenue                 ` 110,31,15,603 (A)
         Total cost                         ` 96,64,48,907/- (B)
         Operating Profit                   ` 13,66,66,696 (C)
Arm's Length Price of Operating ` 24,07,42,423 (D) Profit 2 24.91% Adjustment
(D-C) ` 10,40,75,727/-
Accordingly, the Arm's length price of the International Transaction has been
adjusted upwardly by ` 10,40,75,727/-."
4\. The TPO did so by rejecting some of the comparables used by the assessee
and added some more comparables which the assessee had objected. Ld. counsel
of the assessee submitted that he shall be  2 ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010
restricting his arguments against the inclusion of the following in the
transfer pricing analysis.
    S.No. Company Name                      OP/OC margin for F.Y. 2005-06
    1.    Cranes Software International Ltd.          90.91%
    2.    GDA Technologies Limited                    158.06%
    3.    Jayamuruthi Software Systems Limited        103.94%
    4.1   Assessee's submission in this regard is that these are           super
    normal profit making         companies and should be excluded from
comparables set. As there is tendency skew the results and cannot be
considered as representative of the industry. Against the above contention of
the assessee TPO only dealt with Jayamaruthi Software Systems Limited and GDA
Technologies Limited and did not deal with Cranes Software International
Limited. The assessee's submission as regards the GDA Technologies was as
under:-
> "This company did not appear in the search conducted by the assessee in its
> transfer pricing documentation.
> As per the products details available in Prowess database, for F.Y 2005-06,
> the company has earned its entire income from "Computer hardware and
> software".
> On review of this Annual Report (attached as Annexure 4) for FY 2006-07 (as
> annual report for FY 2005-06 is not available) it is observed as follows:-
3
> ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010 • Page 64 of the Annual Report, "....,your company has
> carried out IC design, systems design, software development and PCB layout
> for several global customers."
• Page 64 of the Annual Report, "The company has also started offshore Design
Centres during the year for customers based out of US. The company has
developed office in a Box, several Field Programmable Gage Array boards,
Gigabit Passive Optical Network) during the year."
Based on the above, it is evident that the company is primarily engaged in
developing and licensing of products which are not similar to the services
provided by the assessee. Further, no segmental information is available.
Hence, we wish to submit that the same cannot be considered as a comparable
and should be rejected as "functionally different".
Additionally, the assessee would like to bring to your attention that
supernormal profit making companies should be excluded from the comparable set
as they have a tendency to skew the results and cannot be considered as
representative of the industry.
The judgement pronounced by the Hon'ble Delhi Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(ITAT) in the case of Mentor Graphics (Noida) Pvt. Ltd. mentions the following
on pages 39-40 of the above mentioned ITAT Ruling:
".....The wide difference in the ratio of operating margins...in the final
selection of comparable ....is a clear pointer to the fact that the selection
made was faulty...The OECD guideline on this point is as under-
4
> ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010 1.47 Where the application of one or more methods
> produces a range of figures, a substantial deviation among points in that
> range may indicate that the data used in establishing the some of the points
> may not be as reliable as the data used to establish the other points in the
> range or that the deviation may result from features of the comparable data
> that require adjustments"
> Inferring from the above ruling, we requests your goodself to not consider
> companies displaying abnormal profits since they deviate from the normal
> trend displayed by the data set."
4.2 The assessee's submission as regards the Jayamaruthi Software Systems
Limited was as under:-
> "This company was rejected by the assessee in its transfer pricing
> documentation, on the ground that this company is "functionally not
> comparable".
> • The company has negligible employee cost, i.e. 0.01 cores on turnover of
> 5.69 crores which is extraordinarily low for a service company. Moreover,
> the company's annual report is not available to validate its cost structure.
> Given the abnormal cost structure it is not prudent to rely on the financial
> statements of the company. Hence, the company should be rejected on this
> basis.
> Additionally, the assessee would like to bring to your attention that
> supernormal profit making companies should be excluded from the comparable
> set as they have a tendency to skew the results and cannot be considered as
> representative of the industry.
5
> ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010 The judgement pronounced by the Delhi ITAT in the case
> of Mentor Graphics (Noida) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) has also mentioned the
> reservation against using supernormal profit making companies in the
> comparable set.
> Based on above facts, the company should not be considered as a comparable
> company."
4.3 The assessee's submission as regards the Cranes Software International
Limited was as under:-
> "This company was rejected by the assessee in its transfer pricing
> documentation, on the ground that the company was "functionally not
> comparable".
> The Annual Report (Attached as Annexure 2) and website of the company states
> as under:-
> "Over the last few years, the Company has established itself as a key player
> in the software products market catering to the needs of the global
> scientific and engineering community."
> "Cranes Software International Limited is a company that provides Enterprise
> Statistical Analytics and Engineering Simulation Software Products and
> Solutions across the globe. The Company's business interest span Products,
> Productized Solutions, Services and R&D in future technologies."
> "Cranes Software offers a range of proprietary products - SYSTAT, SigmaPlot,
> SigmaStat, SigmaScan, TableCurve 2D, TableCurve 3D, PeakFit, NISA, XID, XIP,
> Survey ASYST, iCaptella, InventX and World-renowned products from reputed
> principals  6 ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010 such as Engineering Technology
> Associates, The Mathworks, Texas Instruments and IBM".
> Accordingly, Cranes is a product based company and owns proprietary products
> and cannot be compared with the assessee who undertakes only routine
> functions in developing modules of software and does not own any intangibles
> in this regard.
> Further, as per the depreciation schedule of the company for FY 2005-06, out
> of the total net assets value of ` 148.54 cr., the value of intangible
> (computer software) is ` 136.70 cr.
> The presence of intangibles in the balance sheet of Cranes clearly shows
> that, it is performing significant research and development activities to
> develop intangibles. Accordingly, it cannot be considered as being
> comparable to the assessee which is a risk mitigated contract services
> provider and does not own any intellectual property rights (IPRs). Due to
> the presence of intangibles the functions performed and risks assumed by
> Cranes will be different from that of the assessee and cannot be used to
> benchmark the international transaction of the assessee.
> Accordingly, Cranes should not be considered as comparable to Adobe India."
4.4 The TPO's observations with regard to these companies were as under:-
> "With respect to M/s Jayamaruthi Software System Ltd. (Sr. No.
> 24), the submission of the assessee has been rejected and is however,
> required to be included in the list of departmental comparable as it is a
> listed company and the results are  7 ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010 audited. The
> ground that a company is making a supernormal profit, is not accepted on the
> ground that this comparable is showing consistent growth at about same level
> in the preceding years also. Hence, there is no abnormality in its
> performance.
> In respect of M/s GDA Technologies Ltd. (Sr. No. 15), the assessee has
> submitted the accounts of M/s GDA Technology Inc., USA (the parent Company
> of M/s GDA Technologies Ltd.) to show that the said Indian company i.e. M/s
> GDA Technologies Ltd, has sufficient Relates party transactions. However,
> the annual report of the Indian company as well as the information available
> with 'Capital line' database and 'Prowess' data base do not show such
> details of related party transactions. Hence, the submission of the assessee
> is not accepted and accordingly M/s GDA Technologies Ltd. is included in the
> departmental list of comparables."
4.5 Apart from rejecting some of the comparables and adding some more
comparables, the Assessing Officer also used updated data for financial year
2005-06 instead of mean (weighted ALP of earlier years) as computed by the
assessee. Ld. counsel of the assessee in this regard submitted no adjustment
has been made to the assessee's transfer pricing in earlier years and
assessment was done u/s 143(3) of the IT Act. He submitted before us that even
if the data considered by Assessing Officer is used excluding companies with
super normal profits the arithmetic mean of OP/OC will be 17.15% which will
fall within the + - 5% range as permitted by section 92(C)(2).
5\. We have carefully considered the submissions. We find that TPO has
rejected the assessee's contention with regard to inclusion of  8 ITA NO.
5043/DEL/2010 these three supernormal profit companies without any cogent
reason.
He has not given any comment regarding objection of the assessee regarding
inclusion of Crane Software International Limited in the comparables.
Regarding Jayamaruthi Software Systems Ltd. he brushed assessee's objection by
simply stating that it is a listed company and results are audited. Regarding
assessee's objection for inclusion of M/s GDA Technologies Ltd. that the said
company has sufficient related party transaction, but the TPO has brushed the
contention by ignoring the documents submitted by the assessee and holding
that data available with him does not show details of related party
transaction. It is undisputed that these three companies have shown
supernormal comparable profits as compared to the other comparable. There
exclusion from the list of comparable is quite correct. By excluding these
three companies from the comparables and showing the computation on the basis
of TPO data the arithmetic mean of OP/OC to 17.15% which falls within the +-5%
range as permitted by section 92(C)(2). Hence, we find considerable cogency in
the arguments of the ld. counsel of the assessee in this regard.
5.1 We further find that assessee has made voluminous submissions including
paper books before the DRP who has passed a very cursory  9 ITA NO.
5043/DEL/2010 and laconic order without going into the details of the
submissions. We find that this is quite contrary to the mandate of section
144C of the IT Act.
5.2 In our considered opinion, circumstances do not warrant any change in the
mark up. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Assessing Officer and
decide the issue in favour of the assessee.
6\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is allowed.

PER SHAMIM YAHYA: AM This appeal by the Assessee is directed against the order
of the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) dated 05.10.2010 and pertains
to assessment year 2006-07.
2\. The effective issue raised is that Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) erred in passing the assessment order u/s 143(3) read with section
144C of the IT Act. It has been urged that Assessing Officer /DRP has erred in
making the addition of ` 10,40,75,727/- to the income of the assessee on
account of adjustment in the Arms Length Price of international transaction
entered by the assessee with associated enterprise. It has been urged that
TPO/Assessing Officer has erred by accepting companies earning super normal
profits.

ITA NO. 5043/DEL/2010
3\. The brief facts of the case are that the assessee Adobe Systems India
Private Limited (hereinafter called Adobe India or the Assessee) is a wholly
and subsidiary of Adobe Systems Inc., USA. It is engaged in providing software
development services and marketing support services to its associated
enterprises. The TPO in this case noted that the assessee company is showing
OP/Cost Margin of 14.96% which he considered to be quite low, as compared to
other companies which are engaged in similar IT fields. The TPO in this case
passed a Transfer Pricing order making a upward adjustment of ` 10,40,75,727/-
on the arms length price of the international transactions. The TPO had worked
out the average of arithmetic mean of ALP (OP/OC) of 42 comparables at the
average of 24.91 percent. The Arm's Length Price of international transaction
was determined as under:-
         "Operating Revenue                 ` 110,31,15,603 (A)
         Total cost                         ` 96,64,48,907/- (B)
         Operating Profit                   ` 13,66,66,696 (C)
Arm's Length Price of Operating ` 24,07,42,423 (D) Profit 2 24.91% Adjustment
(D-C) ` 10,40,75,727/-
submissions. We find that this is quite contrary to the mandate of section
144C of the IT Act.
5.2 In our considered opinion, circumstances do not warrant any change in the
mark up. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Assessing Officer and
decide the issue in favour of the assessee.
6\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is allowed.
