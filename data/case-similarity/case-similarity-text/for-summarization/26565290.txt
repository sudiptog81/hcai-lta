                                    ORDER
PER R. K. PANDA, AM :
This appeal filed by the assessee is directed against the order dated
09.12.2016 passed by the ACIT, Central Circle- 20, New Delhi u/s 143(3) r.w.s.
144C(1) of the I.T. Act for the assessment year 2012-13.
2\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a company
incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956 and is engaged in the
business of distribution of mobile handset and accessories. It is a subsidiary
of M/s Brightpoint Netherlands which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of
M/s Brightpoint Inc.. M/s Brightpoint Netherlands held 85% of the paid up
share capital of M/s Brightpoint India and balance 15% held by M/s Persequor
2 ITA No.123/Del/2017 Limited. M/s Brightpoint India commenced its operations
from June 2003 and is engaged in the business of distribution of mobile
handsets and accessories and also provides after sales services to its
customers by undertaking warranty and non-warranty claim processing for
various brands. Brightpoint group is engaged in the business of distribution
of wireless voice and data products and a supplier of outsourced services
worldwide. The assessee filed its return of income on 29.11.2012 showing total
income of Rs.3,51,38,534/-. The Assessing Officer referred the matter to the
TPO to determine the arm's length price u/s 92CA(3) in respect of the
international transactions entered into by the assessee.
2.1 The TPO, during the course of TP assessment proceedings, observed that the
assessee has reported the following international transactions :-
           Nature of the transaction                       Method                      Value (Rs.)
           Sale of mobile handsets                         TNMM using                  105,33,54,438
           Receipt of IT & software maintenance services   Operating profit as a PLI     5,32,21,360
           Receipt of management support services          Operating cost                4,49,25,556
           Purchase of hardware                                                            30,91,862
           Provision of services                                                           30,77,244
           Payment of interest on external commercial      CUP                             40,22,969
           borrowing
           Reimbursement of expenses to AEs                                              1,39,81,268
           Reimbursement received from AEs                                                 41,55,207
3\. The TPO issued a show-cause notice asking the assessee to furnish various
details in response to which, the assessee filed the requisite details. From
the various details furnished by the assessee, the TPO observed that the
assessee has benchmarked the transactions relating to Intra Group Services
(IGS) availed from its AE using combined transaction approach considering  3
ITA No.123/Del/2017 TNMM as the most appropriate method. However, the TPO
rejected the TNMM qua IGS and instead applied the CUP method. However, while
applying the CUP method, no comparable was put on record and arm's length
price was taken as Nil and accordingly the TPO made an upward adjustment of
Rs.4,49,25,556/-. The Assessing Officer passed the draft assessment order. The
assessee approached the DRP, who upheld the adjustment made by the TPO.
Accordingly, the Assessing Officer completed the assessment by enhancing the
income of the assessee by Rs.4,49,25,556/- and determined the total income of
Rs.8,00,64,090/-.
4\. Aggrieved with such order of the Assessing Officer/TPO, the assessee is in
appeal before the Tribunal by raising the following grounds :-
> "Appeal under Section 253(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ("Act") against the
> order dated 09 December 2016 (received on 16 December 2016) passed under
> Section 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act ("impugned order"), by the
> ld. Assistant Commissioner of Income Central Circle - 20, New Delhi ("AO").
> Following grounds are without prejudice to each other:
> GROUNDS OF APPEAL
> 1.That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, Assessing
> Officer ("Ld. AO") erred in assessing the income of the Appellant at INR.
> 8,00,64,090/- as against the returned income of INR. 3,51,38,534/-.
2\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Final
Assessment order passed under section 143(3) read with section 144C of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 ("the Act") by the Ld. AO is bad in law as the same do
not consider complete and relevant facts, are not in accordance with
provisions of law and principles of law as laid down by Hon'ble courts.
TRANSFER PRICING GROUNDS
3\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, Ld. TPO/ Ld.
AO / Hon'ble Dispute Resolution Panel ("DRP") have erred in not accepting
economic analysis of the Appellant, for determination of the arm's length
price ('ALP') in connection with the impugned international transaction
pertaining to payment of management support services.
4
ITA No.123/Del/2017
4\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP have grossly erred in rejecting the combined
transaction approach of benchmarking adopted by the Appellant in its transfer
pricing documentation analysis, and by rejecting Transactional Net Margin
Method ('TNMM') as the most appropriate method ('MAM') for determining the
arms' length price ('ALP') of payment for business service charges paid to its
associated enterprises ('AEs') in accordance with the Act, Income Tax Rules,
1962 ('Rules') and the generally accepted OECD guidelines.
5\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in not appreciating that the receipt of
various business services are closely linked to the overall business
activities of the Appellant and erred in analyzing the transaction separately
for the determination of ALP.
6\. That the Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in not conducting the analysis of
selecting the MAM as prescribed under Rule 10C of the Rules and accordingly
not documented the same as prescribed under Rule 10D of the Rules.
7\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in law by determining the ALP of the
international transaction using Comparable Uncontrolled Price ('CUP') method
without following the manner of applying the CUP method prescribed under Rule
10B(1)(a) of the Rules.
8\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP has failed to consider the objections made on the
applicability and suitability of Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method to the
facts of the case and case laws cited including those of jurisdictional High
Court and rendered findings without a reasoned order on such objections.
9\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP have erred in upholding the adoption of CUP
method as the most appropriate method for determining the arm's length price
in respect of the impugned international transaction without identifying any
comparable uncontrolled transaction(s) for the computation of the ALP as
prescribed in Section 92F(ii) of the Act.
10.That the basis to disallow the payments made for management services by
considering CUP as Nil is based purely on surmises and conjectures and has no
basis in facts and in law.
11\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in passing an order that is perverse in
law by ignoring the relevant submissions, information and documents provided
by the Appellant including but not limited to email exchanges, cost allocation
documents, service agreement, invoices etc. to substantiate the receipt of
business services, and based on a preoccupied mind reached at an inappropriate
conclusion that the arm's length value of the impugned transactions should be
Nil.
12.The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred erred in arriving at various unwarranted and
erroneous conclusions unsupported by any material and have also failed to
consider, specifically rebut the various material and evidences adduced and
the submission made by Appellant to substantiate the arm's length nature of
transaction relating to payment of management support charges.
13\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP has erroneously relied on the Base Erosion and
Profit Shifting ('BEPS') report released in 2015 to reject the objections of
the Appellant without considering the reports in their entirety and in
ignoring the binding protection and applicable provisions of the Act and the
Rules.
14\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in questioning the commercial rationale of
the  5 ITA No.123/Del/2017 legitimate business expenses incurred by the
taxpayer and not restricting the scope of assessment under section 92CA to
determining the arm's length price of the international transaction by
adopting one of the prescribed methods only.
15\. The finding of the Hon'ble DRP that the payment may be alternatively
disallowed under Section 37(1) is erroneous and contrary to the finding that
the commercial expediency has not been doubted by Ld. TPO & AO.
16\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in disregarding the documentary evidence
submitted by the Appellant and questioning the need and actual receipt of
services by the Appellant.
17.The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in disregarding the documentary evidence
submitted by the Appellant and concluding that no benefit has been received by
the Appellant by receipt of impugned services without appreciating that the
same is irrelevant for the computation of arm's length price.
18\. The Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble DRP erred in facts and in law by concluding the
following, without providing any material on record to substantiate the basis
of concluding that -
> i. services rendered by the AEs are duplicative in nature for which no
> separate payment needs to be made;
> ii. services rendered by the AEs are incidental services or shareholder
> activity for the benefit of the group;
> iii. supporting documents provided by the assessee before Ld. TPO/ Hon'ble
> DRP are generic in nature iv. no independent enterprise would have made such
> payments for similar services rendered by another enterprise;
v. no details provided in connection to the costs incurred and cost allocation
mechanism implemented to allocate the costs to the Appellant by its AE
Initiation of penalty proceedings
19\. That on facts and circumstances of the case, the Ld. AO erred in
initiating penalty proceedings under section 271(1)(c) of the Act.
20\. The Appellant craves to leave to add, withdraw, alter, modify, amend or
vary the above grounds of appeal before or at the time of hearing.
21\. The Appellant has preferred a rectification application u/s 154 in
connection to the inadvertent mistakes by the Ld. AO.
The Appellant craves leave to add to, alter or amend the above Grounds of
Appeal as and when advised."
6
ITA No.123/Del/2017
5\. Grounds of appeal no.1 and 2 being general in nature were not pressed by
the ld. counsel for the assessee for which ld. DR has no objection.
Accordingly, these grounds are dismissed as not pressed.
6\. So far as grounds no.3 and 4 are concerned, it is grievance of the
assessee that the benchmarking of transaction through the combined transaction
approach by applying of TNMM was wrongly rejected.
7\. Ld. counsel for the assessee submitted that the TPO disregarded the
combined transaction approach on the ground that the transaction are separate
in nature as according to him export commission, royalty and model fee are
separate in nature. He submitted that there is no specific findings by the DRP
on this issue. He submitted that the combined transaction approach is well
accepted as per the provisions of section 92C(1) of the I.T. Act which speaks
about "nature of transaction or class of transaction". Further, the term
'transaction' itself is defined in Rule 10A(d) of the I.T. Rules, 1962 to
include a number of 'closely linked transactions'. The OECD transfer pricing
guidelines at para 3.9 and 3.11 recognize that if certain transactions are
closely linked then they can be benchmarked together. He submitted that the
basis of separate analysis for export commission, royalty and model fee is
completely perverse and does not relate to the facts of this case. There is no
export commission, royalty and model fee paid in the present case. In absence
of such transaction the very basis of rejection of TNMM is illusory and the
same should have been accepted. He submitted that the TNMM has been adopted
for five transaction  7 ITA No.123/Del/2017 using the combined transaction
approach as these activities are closely linked to the main activity i.e. sale
and distribution of handsets in a highly competitive market and after sales
services, which are of technical nature. Further, the basis adopted in the TP
report for adopting TNMM has not been rebutted. The TPO has failed to indicate
any reasons for rejection of TNMM as the most appropriate method. Referring to
the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Avery Denison vs. ACIT reported in
(2016) 65 taxmann.com 188, he submitted that the Tribunal in the said decision
has held that a single transaction cannot be isolated for applying CUP method.
He submitted that the above decision of the Tribunal has been upheld by the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court. He accordingly submitted that since the order of the
Assessing Officer/TPO is completely perverse the grounds raised by the
assessee should be allowed.
8\. So far as grounds no.6 to 10 are concerned, the same relate to application
of CUP method as the most appropriate method for determination of arm's length
price for the transaction between the assessee and its AE.
9\. Ld. counsel for the assessee submitted that as per the TPO, IGS rendered
are not at arm's length price. According to him, no uncontrolled enterprise
would have paid any amount for services not amounting to IGS and without any
benefits. Therefore, arm's length price was calculated by him by applying CUP
method as Nil, which has been upheld by the DRP. He submitted that the TPO/DRP
have incorrectly applied the CUP method without bringing out any comparable on
record and, therefore, approach of the TPO/DRP is contrary to  8 ITA
No.123/Del/2017 Rule 10B(2) of the I.T. Rules, 1962 and the judicial
precedents. For the above proposition, he relied on the following decisions :-
> a. AWB India P. Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2014) 50 taxmann.com 323. b. Frigogolas
> India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 68 taxmann.com 370.
> c. Mitsui Prime Advanced Composite India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 70
> taxmann.com 123.
> d. Knorr Bremse vs. ACIT, (2017) 77 taxmann.com 101.
10\. He accordingly submitted that the above grounds should be allowed.
11\. So far as grounds no.5, 16 and 17 are concerned, the same relate to the
failure of the TPO/DRP to appreciate that benefit has been received by the
assessee.
12\. Ld. counsel for the assessee referring to the above grounds submitted
that as per the TPO, no documentary evidences were produced to establish that
the Intra Group Services were needed by the assessee and the services are
merely duplicative in nature and they do not amount to IGS. The DRP held that
the assessee failed to demonstrate that services were actually needed.
According to them, the assessee has failed to prove that services are not
duplicative and payment was made at arm's length price. According to the DRP,
the evidence filed by the assessee does not satisfy the need test and fail to
demonstrate that services were actually received. He submitted that the TPO
has rendered contradictory findings i.e. on one hand he has disputed the
receipt of services and on the other hand he has stated that services received
are incidental and  9 ITA No.123/Del/2017 duplicative. He submitted that since
the assessee has made TDS on payments to its AEs, the same indicates that
services were actually received for which payment was made. Further, the
assessee had filed voluminous documents to substantiate that the services have
in-fact been rendered. Referring to page 301 of the Paper Book (Volume - I) he
submitted that independent auditor's certificate given to BP Australia proves
that services have been rendered by the AE and received by the assessee.
Referring to page 212 to 235 of the Paper Book (Volume - I), he submitted that
the invoices show that employee cost has been shared and taxes have been
deducted by the assessee. Referring to page 240 to 300 of the Paper Book
(Volume - I), he drew the attention of the Bench to the sample email
correspondence. Referring to page 685 of the Paper Book (Volume - I), he drew
the attention of the Bench to the reasons for availing services as indicated
in the Management Cross Charge report. He submitted that BIPL has no team for
internal audit and these services are performed by the AE. Referring to page
563 to 682 of the Paper Book (Volume - II), he drew the attention of the Bench
to the detailed submission before the DRP including evidence for provision of
services. He submitted that the services are not duplicative in nature and the
Assessing Officer has incorrectly gone on cost benefit. Relying on the
following decisions, he submitted that benefit from a transaction need not be
proved :-
          a.    Knorr Bremse vs. ACIT, 380 ITR 307.
          b.    E.I. DuPont India (P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT, (2016) 72 taxmann.com 215.

                                                                   ITA No.123/Del/2017

          e.     Dresser Rand India (P) Ltd. vs. Addl.CIT, (2011) 13 taxmann.com
                 82.
13\. Referring to the decision of the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in
the case of CIT vs. Max India reported in (2016) 75 taxmann.com 268, he
submitted that the receipt of service is established on balance of
probabilities and the agreement for services may be oral or written. He
accordingly submitted that the above grounds raised by the assessee should be
allowed.
14\. So far as grounds no.14 and 15 are concerned, the same relate to action
of the TPO/DRP in questioning the commercial expediency of the transactions
entered into by the assessee.
15\. Ld. counsel for the assessee referring to the decision in the case of EKL
Appliances reported in (2012) 24 taxmann.com 199 submitted that it is well-
established principle that the Department cannot question the commercial
expediency of a transaction.
16\. So far as ground no.13 is concerned, the same relates to the order of the
DRP/TPO in relying on the BEPS report without considering the reports in their
entirety and by ignoring binding provisions of the Act and decisions of the
Tribunal.
17\. Ld. counsel for the assessee submitted that the BEPS report, if read in
entirety, clearly provides that centralized services, services on call as IGS
ought  11 ITA No.123/Del/2017 to be considered for determining the arm's
length price and cannot be rejected as merely shareholder services. BEPS
report in-fact supports the case of the assessee for determining arm's length
price using TNMM. He accordingly submitted that the grounds raised by the
assessee should be allowed. 17.1 The remaining other grounds were not pressed
by the ld. counsel for the assessee being general/argumentative/supportive in
nature for which ld. DR has no objection. Accordingly, these grounds are
dismissed as not pressed.
18\. Ld. DR on the other hand strongly relied on the order of the Assessing
Officer/TPO/DRP and submitted that the Revenue authorities have correctly
appreciated the facts and passed the order by making an upward adjustment of
Rs.4,49,25,556/- and, therefore, the same should be upheld. In his alternate
contention, he submitted that he has no objection if the matter is restored to
the file of the Assessing Officer/TPO for adjudication of the issues afresh in
the light of the various decisions relied on by the ld. counsel for the
assessee.
19\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides and perused
the orders of the authorities below. We find the assessee in the instant case
is engaged in the business of distribution of mobile handset and accessories.
It also provides after sales services to its customers through its services
centres. The assessee has availed certain Intra Group Services from its AE and
in order to ascertain the arm's length price of these transactions, the
assessee benchmarked these transactions using the combined transaction
approach considering TNMM as the most appropriate method. We find the  12 ITA
No.123/Del/2017 Assessing Officer/TPO rejected the TNMM for the IGS and
instead applied CUP method which has been upheld by the DRP. It is the
submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee that the combined transaction
approach is well accepted as per the provisions of section 92C(1) which speaks
about 'nature of transaction or class of transaction'. It is also his
submission that the term 'transaction' itself is defined in Rule 10A(d) of the
I.T. Rules, 1962 to include a number of 'closely linked transactions'. It is
also his argument that the finding of the Assessing Officer/TPO that the basis
of separate analysis is 'export commission, royalty and model fee' is
completely perverse since the assessee has not received any export commission,
royalty or model fee. It is also his argument that the TNMM has been adopted
for five transactions using the combined transaction approach as these
activities are closely linked to the main business activity i.e. sale and
distribution of handsets. It is also his submission that the Assessing
Officer/TPO has not rebutted the basis adopted in the TP report for adopting
TNMM and they failed to indicate the reasons for rejecting the TNMM as the
most appropriate method. Further, they have been incorrectly applied the CUP
method without bringing out any comparable on record. It is contrary to Rule
10B(2) of the I.T. Rules, 1962. Similarly, it is also his arguments that the
assessee had filed voluminous documents to establish that the IGS were needed
by the assessee and are not duplicative in nature. All those details filed
before the TPO/DRP were completely ignored. It is also his argument that the
Department cannot question the commercial expediency of  13 ITA
No.123/Del/2017 the transactions. In our opinion and considering the totality
of the facts of the case, the matter requires a fresh adjudication at the
level of the Assessing Officer/TPO in the light of the various evidences
produced before them and in the light of the decisions relied on by the ld.
counsel for the assessee before us. We, therefore, restore the entire issue to
the file of the Assessing Officer/TPO with a direction to decide the issue
afresh in accordance with law after giving due opportunity of being heard to
the assessee. We hold and directly accordingly. The grounds raised by the
assessee are accordingly allowed for statistical purposes.
20\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is allowed for
statistical purposes.
