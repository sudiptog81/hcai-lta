                                 ORDER
Per Smt.Beena Pillai, JM :
Present cross appeals cross objection arises out of order dated 22/01/16
passed by Ld.Dy.CIT under section 143 (3) read with section 144C of the act
filed by assessee and revenue on following grounds of appeal:
ITA (TP)A No. 626/B/2016 (assessee's appeal) The grounds mentioned herein are
without prejudice to one another:
1\. That the order of the learned Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-
2(1)(1), Bangalore ("the learned Assessing Officer" or "the learned AO")
pursuant to the direction of the learned Dispute Resolution Panel ("the
learned Panel" or "the learned DRP"), to the extent prejudicial to the
Appellant, is bad in law and liable to be quashed.
Transfer Pricing Related
2\. That the learned AO and the learned DRP erred in upholding the rejection
by the learned Transfer Pricing Officer ("the learned TPO") of the analysis
undertaken by the Appellant in its Transfer Pricing ("TP") documentation, and
thereby erred in not appreciating that the Appellant had prepared the TP
documentation with bona fide and in good faith.
3\. The learned AO and the learned DRP erred in law and on facts in
disregarding application of multiple year / prior year data as used by the
Appellant in the TP documentation and holding that only current year (i.e.
financial year 2010- 11 relevant to assessment year 2011-12) data for
comparable companies should be used.
4\. The learned AO and the learned DRP erred on facts  2 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA
no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 and in law in upholding the acts of
the learned TPO:
(a) in conducting a fresh benchmarking analysis using non-contemporaneous data
and substituting the Appellant's analysis with fresh benchmarking analysis
based on his own conjectures and assumptions.
(b) in rejecting the comparability analysis of the Appellant in the TP
documentation and in submissions provided during the assessment proceedings,
and confirming the comparability analysis as adopted by the learned TPO in the
transfer pricing order, which is based on inappropriate filters and
application of inconsistent comparability criteria.
5\. That the learned AOI learned TPO/ learned DRP, while computing the
Transfer Pricing adjustment, erred in computing the operating revenues and
operating cost of the Appellant in respect of both the Software Development
Services segment and the Information Technology enabled Services (ITeS)
segment, consequently leading to a reduction in the effective mark-up earned
by the Appellant, thereby resulting in an incremental transfer pricing
adjustment.
6\. Based on the above facts and in the circumstances of the case. the learned
AO / the learned TPO / learned DRP erred in making adjustment to the transfer
price of the Appellant's international transactions with its related parties
by INR 496,406,627.
7\. That the learned AO / learned TPO erred in considering companies in the
comparability analysis (for software development services segment and
Information Technology enabled services segment) which do not satisfy the test
of comparability.
8\. That the learned AO / learned TPO erred in rejecting  3 ITA No.505/B/2016
ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 companies similar to the
Appellant while performing the comparability analysis (for software
development services segment and Information Technology enabled services
segment).
9\. That the learned AO / learned TPO / learned DRP erred in computation of
working capital adjustment while determining the arm's length margin.
10\. That on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the learned AO /
learned TPO / learned DRP erred in levying notional interest amounting to INR
74,808,532 on the outstanding debtors of INR 555,784,049 by re-characterising
the outstanding debtors to be a loan transaction.
11\. That the learned AO / learned TPO / learned DRP, notwithstanding that
interest ought not to be levied, has erred in computing the interest on an
annual basis, without considering the ageing analysis of the total amount of
outstanding debtors exceeding 6 months. Other than Transfer Pricing Related
12\. That the learned AO erred in granting the TDS credit of Rs 11,482,278 as
against an amount of Rs 19,312,904 which was claimed by the company while
filing its Income-tax return.
13\. Consequently, the learned AO erred in charging interest under section
234B of the Act.
14\. Consequently, the learned AO erred in charging interest under section
234C of the Act.
That the Appellant craves leave to add to and/or to alter, amend, rescind,
modify the grounds herein above or produce further documents before or at the
time of hearing of this Appeal."

no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 "1. On the issue of excess claim
u/s 10A and 10AA, whether the DRP was right in relying on the decision of the
Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in the case of Tata Elxsi & Others v. CIT (349
ITR 98) and in allowing the claim in favour of the assessee and against the
Revenue. The decision is not accepted in principle but due to low tax effect,
further appeal is suggested.
2\. On the issue of disallowance of software expenses whether the DRP was
right in relying upon the decision of the Hon'ble ITAT in assessee's own case
for A.Y. 2008-09 and in allowing the appeal. AO has not accepted the decision.
3\. Whether ld.DRP has erred in granting 1% risk adjustment arbitrarily
without appreciating the facts of the case and its comparables.
4\. Whether Hon'ble DRP erred in fact in rejecting the company as a comparable
on the grounds that it is functionally different when the primary source of
income of the comparable is from provision of software development services.
5\. Whether while seeking the exact comparability as mentioned above the DRP
was right in fact and in law in imposing condition beyond law whereas the
requirement of law is to acknowledge only those differences that are likely to
materially affect the margin."
CO No.146/B/2018 (by assessee in revenue's appeal) "The Respondent - Cross-
Objector most humbly submits as under:
1\. That, even apart from having turnovers of less than Rs.200 crores and thus
having rightly been directed to be excluded from the list of comparables to
the Respondent's Software Development Services ('SWD' for short) segment,
Acropetal Technologies Ltd., e-Zest Solutions Ltd., E- Infochips Ltd., ICRA
Techno Analytics Ltd., and Persistent Systems and Solutions Ltd. ought to
remain excluded from the list of comparables as the functions performed,

having rightly been directed to be excluded from the list of comparables to
the Respondent's Information Technology enabled Services ('ITeS' for short)
segment, Infosys BPO Ltd. and iGate Global Solutions Ltd.
ought to remain e eluded from the list of comparables as the functions
performed, assets employed and risks assumed by the said companies are
entirely dissimilar and incomparable to those of the Respondent's ITeS
segment.
The Respondent submits that the above grounds are independent of and without
prejudice to one another. The Respondent also craves leave of this Hon'ble
Tribunal to add to and / or amend all or any of the abovementioned grounds of
cross objections at any time before the final hearing and disposal of the
present case."
Brief facts of the case are as under:
2\. Assessee is a company engaged in business of development of computer
software consultancy, IT enabled services and in developing, distributing and
maintaining information technology related products and services. Assessee
filed its return of income for year under consideration declaring total income
of Rs.52,22,33,025/-. The return was processed under section 143 (1) of the
Act, and was selected for scrutiny. Consequentially, notices under section 143
(2), 142 (1) along with questionnaire was issued to assessee. In response to
statutory notices, representative of assessee appeared before Ld.AO and filed
requisite details as called for.

ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 2.1. From
details filed by assessee, Ld.AO observed that assessee has entered into
international transaction with its associated enterprise that exceeds Rs.15
crores. Accordingly, case was referred to transfer pricing officer to
determine arm's length price under section 92CA of the Act.
Upon receipt of reference, Ld.TPO called for economic details in respect of
international transaction entered into by assessee. Ld.TPO observed that
assessee had following international transactions with its associated
enterprises:
                Particulars                           Amount in Rs.
       Provision of services, SWD                    3,86,63,46,033/-

As assessee's margin was more than the average margin of comparables selected
under respective segments, the transaction with AE was treated to be at arms
length.
2.2. Ld.TPO upon analysing comparables selected by assessee under both
segments, rejected certain comparables on the basis of certain filters
applied. Ld.TPO carried out fresh search and finalised following set of 13

        2.         Provision of ITES services        Rs.14,23,71,346/-
2.3. Ld.TPO restricted working capital adjustment to 1.63%. He also denied any
risk adjustment for the reason that assessee failed to establish the
difference in risk level of the tested party and uncontrolled comparables and
that no reasonably accurate adjustments could be made for want of a scientific
method for computing the quantum of risk adjustment. The Ld.TPO did not
consider certain expenses as operating in nature while computing the margins
of comparables like, provision for doubtful debts, provision for warranty etc.
Ld.TPO levied interest on outstanding debtors and proposed adjustment
amounting to Rs.7,48,08,532/-.

ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 Ld.AO/TPO
reduced export turnover with telecommunication charges while computing 10 A/AA
deduction without reducing the same from total turnover. Ld.AO/TPO disallowed
computer software expenses by holding it to be capital in nature ignoring the
decisions of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in assessee's own case for
assessment year 2007-08 2008-09.
2.4. Aggrieved by proposed adjustment, assessee raised objections before DRP.
DRP in respect of in appropriate selection of comparables by Ld.TPO, upheld
certain exclusion on turnover filter, and others were confirmed. Insofar as
issues pertaining to working capital adjustment, interest on receivables
computing the margins of the comparables are concerned, DRP upheld Ld.TPO's
observations. In respect of objections for not granting risk adjustment DRP
directed Ld.AO/TPO to provide 1% risk adjustment to assessee. Insofar as
computation of deduction under section 10 A/AA concerned DRP directed to
follow ratio by Hon'able Karnataka High Court in case of CIT vs Tata Elxsi
Ltd., reported in (2012) 349 ITR 98 and insofar as considering software
expenses as capital, DRP directed Ld.AO to follow view taken by this Tribunal
in assessee's own case for assessment year 2007-08 and 2008-09.
2.5.Upon receipt of directions from DRP, Ld.AO passed impugned assessment
order by making an ad addition of Rs.49,46,06,672/-.
12
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 Aggrieved by
impugned order passed by Ld.AO, assessee, as well as revenue, is in appeal
before us. Assessee has also filed cross objection against the additional
ground raised by revenue subsequently. 2.6. Revenue in their appeal raised
following Revised Additional ground vide Application dated 20.11.2018 in
respect of rejecting comparables on the basis of high turnover by DRP:
"Revised Additional grounds:
1\. Hon'ble DRP erred in directing AO/TPO to exclude the software development
companies whose turnover is below 200 crores and DRP further erred in
directing the AO/TPO to exclude IT enabled services companies whose turnover
is more than 200 crores whereas in case of Chriscapital Investment Advisory
(India) Pvt.Ltd vs DCIT, 56 Taxmann.com 417 (2015) (12) it was held that
turnover cannot be the sole criteria to reject comparables."
2.6.1. Ld.CIT DR submitted that the issue arises from the records and there is
no need to consider any fresh evidences for adjudicating the additional ground
raised. Ld.CIT DR submitted that DRP erred in directing exclusion of companies
whose turnover is more than 200 crores in respect of segments under
consideration. She submitted that turnover cannot be the only criteria for
exclusion. She submitted that t was an inadvertent omission for raising
grounds in respect of the same.
2.6.2. On the contrary, Ld.AR submitted that assessee strongly objects for
Additional ground to be admitted as, by way of additional ground revenue is
seeking to challenge what is already settled by various decisions of this
Tribunal. However Ld.AR also submitted that assessee has filed cross objection
against the additional ground  13 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO
No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 raised by revenue in support of all those
comparables excluded by DRP by applying turnover filter. Ld.AR submitted that
even apart from not satisfying the turnover filter, these comparables so
excluded by DRP are functionally also not similar captive service provider
like assessee.
2.6.3. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us.
It is observed that issue alleged by revenue in additional ground arises from
the order passed by DRP and that no new records needs to be looked into to
adjudicate the ground. Therefore, following decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in case of NTPC Ltd Vs CIT reported in 229 ITR 383, we are of considered
opinion that, issue emanates from records placed before us, and therefore
deserves to be admitted. Respectfully following the above, we do not find any
reason not to admit additional ground.
Accordingly, revised additional ground raised by assessee stands admitted.
2.7. All issues raised by assessee and revenue intermingle with each other. We
therefore take up assessee's appeal wherein certain comparables
included/excluded by DRP are under challenge in assessee's as well as
revenue's appeal. The cross objection filed by assessee is in support of
exclusion of comparables by DRP which revenue challenges by way of additional
ground admitted hereinabove.

3\. Ld.AR submitted that Ground No. 1 to 6 in assessee's appeal are general in
nature and therefore do not require adjudication. Ground No.7-8 (assessee
appeal) are in respect of inclusion/exclusion of comparables under software
development segment and ITES segment.
Software development service segment (SWD) Comparable sought for exclusion:

sought for inclusion:
 LGS global Ltd  FCS software solutions Ltd ITES segment Comparables sought
for exclusion  Accentia technologies Ltd  Acropetal Technologies Ltd  ICRA

3.2. Based upon above FAR analysis, we shall consider the comparables alleged
for inclusion/exclusion by assessee under both segments.
Software development service segment (SWD) Comparable sought for exclusion:
Persistent Systems and Solutions Ltd This comparable has been included by
Ld.TPO though it has been objected by assessee on functional dissimilarities.
It has been submitted that segmental information is in respect of this company
is not available in the annual report.
18
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 Ld. CIT DR
placed reliance upon orders of authorities below. We have perused submissions
advanced by both sides in light of the records placed before us.
Annual report of this company is placed at page 1011 to 1022 of paper book
Index to Annual Reports Volume 1. We find that this company earned income from
sale of software services and products and no segmental details are available
in respect of the same. It is also observed that income generated under both
these segments cumulatively amounts to tune of Rs.6.67 crores and in schedule
11, entire revenue has been shown under one segment. It is also observed that
this company is rendering software development services and licensing, and
earns royalty of software products. Therefore in our considered opinion, in
the absence of segmental details we cannot appreciate the view taken by
authorities below. Accordingly we direct Ld.TPO to exclude this company from
the final list.
Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd Assessee seek exclusion of this
comparable for the reason that it is engaged in development of software
products and has inventory is an intangible assets. It has been submitted by
Ld.AR that this company is also having huge expenditures under R&D head. He
further submitted that during the year under consideration revenue from
software products is more and it launched a new product called VYAPAR SEVA.
Ld.AR submitted that this company has significant intangibles and inventory is
and therefore should be rejected to be  19 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016
CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 compared with a captive service provider like
assessee. In support of his contentions he placed reliance upon decision of
this Tribunal in case of Comscope Networks (I) Pvt.Ltd. vs ITO in IT(TP)A
No.166 & 181/B/2016, vide order dated 22/02/2017.
On the contrary Ld. CIT DR placed reliance upon orders passed by authorities
below. She submitted that though there is revenue from 3 separate segments
however segmental information are available. She also submitted that the
product launched is for a future period and has not generated any revenue
during the year under consideration. There is no impact of this launch on the
financials of this company for year under consideration. In all fairness she
submitted that the comparable nay be set aside to Ld.AO/TPO for verification
of the same.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before.
At page 1304 of the annual report placed in Volume 1 of Index to Annual
Reports it is observed that segmental details has been provided. All details
relevant for computing the margin of this comparable are available at page
1304-1305 of paper book. We are therefore unable to appreciate arguments
advanced by Ld.AR regarding segmental details not available. Further it is
observed that Ld.TPO considered the consolidated figure appearing in profit
and loss account, instead of considering segmental profits from software
services of this company. We therefore set aside this comparable to  20 ITA
No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 Ld.AO/TPO to
verify relevant observations recorded herein above and to recompute margins of
this comparable.
Accordingly this comparable is set aside to learnt AO/TPO.
3.2.1. Comparables sought for inclusion: LGS global Ltd & FCS software
solutions Ltd Assessee is seeking inclusion of these comparable. It has been
submitted that LGS Global Ltd., was submitted as an addition to original list
of comparables during TP assessment. Ld.AR submitted that Ld.TPO rejected this
company on the ground that annual report did not give breakup of employee
cost. As regards FCS Software Solutions Ltd, Ld.AR submitted that this
comparable was initially proposed by Ld.TPO in the show cause notice but
subsequently not included on the sole ground that impact of its working
capital on profit was more than 4%, despite the fact that Ld.TPO categorically
held it is functionally similar to assessee. Ld.CIT DR placed reliance upon
decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal, wherein this comparable is held
to be not a good comparable in case of ACIT vs AT& T Global Business Services
India (P) Ltd reported in (2019) 101 Taxmann.com 10. However in all fairness
she submitted that in case of Finestra software solutions (India) Pvt Ltd vs
ACIT reported in (2018) 93 Taxmann.com 460 wherein these comparables have been
set aside. She therefore submitted that these comparables may be set aside to
Ld.AO/TPO for due verification.
21
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 We have
perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed before
us.
It is observed that in case of Finestra software solutions (India) Pvt Ltd vs
ACIT (supra), it has been observed that both these companies have been held
functionally similar with captive service provider like assessee. However
since working capital adjustments are not provided these comparables have been
held to be not included in the finalist. We do not subscribe to such
observations of Ld. TPO/DRP. We direct Ld. AO/TPO to consider these
comparables by providing proper working capital adjustments in accordance with
law. Accordingly these comparables are set aside to Ld.AO/TPO. 3.3. ITES
segment 3.3.1. Comparables sought for exclusion Accentia technologies Ltd
Assessee had objected for inclusion of this company before authorities below.
Ld.AR submitted that this company is engaged in services are akin to knowledge
process outsourcing, which is evident from annual report. It has been
submitted that under this segment assessee is rendering back-office services,
which is merely supportive in nature. He also submitted that further this
company does only medical transcription but has also ventured into healthcare
receivable cycle management and high end consultancy to start-ups requiring
field experts. Ld.AR submitted that segmental details of various activities
carried out by this company is not available and also has significant
intangibles. In support of his contentions he  22 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA
no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 placed reliance on decision of
coordinate bench of this Tribunal in case of Swiss Re Shared services (India)
Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT reported in (2016) 76 Taxmann.com 22.
On the contrary, Ld. CIT DR placed reliance upon the orders of authorities
below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us it is observed that though this company was into medical
transcription and other services. It can neither be held to be a high-end
activity, nor can be held to be low-end services. However it is observed that
this company had undergone acquisition, which is an extraordinary event and
can impact profits for year under consideration. Under such circumstances we
are of the opinion that this company cannot be considered to be comparable
with that of assessee for the year under consideration. Accordingly direct
this company to be deleted from the finalist. ICRA Online Ltd Assessee
objected for inclusion of this comparable. Ld.AR submitted that this company
is functionally not comparable under this segment as it is providing high-end
KPO services, whereas assessee is carrying out back office services. He also
submitted that this company fails RPT filter applied by Ld.TPO.
On the contrary Ld. CIT DR placed reliance on view taken by this Tribunal in
case of Swiss Re Shared services (India) Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT (supra).

ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 We have

us.
The annual report of this company is placed at page 1738-1760 of Index to
Annual Reports Paper Book Volume 2. It is observed that this company has 3
reportable segments being information services, outsourced services, software
services. Further it is observed that, this Tribunal in case of Swiss Re
Shared services (India) Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT (supra) and M/s Zyme Solutions Pvt.Ltd
vs ACIT in ITA (TP) A No. 85/B/2016 for assessment year 2011-12 remanded this
company for fresh consideration to Ld. AO/TPO. Following the same, we also
direct this company to be set- aside to Ld.AO/TPO for fresh consideration of
comparability the lines indicated in these cases.
Accordingly this comparable stand set aside for fresh consideration.
Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd This company was objected by assessee for its
inclusion before Ld.TPO for the reason that service income is from BPO and
does not satisfy the filter used by Ld.TPO of sales more than Rs.1 crore. It
is also also been submitted that this company does not satisfy the service
income filter of more than 75% of total operating revenue as applied by
Ld.TPO. Ld.AR submitted that the segmental details of this company are
unavailable and therefore it cannot be ascertained whether the services
provided by this company in BPO segment is similar to that of assessee.

The annual report of this company is placed at page 1761-1831 of Index to

of Swiss Re Shared services (India) Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT (supra) and M/s Zyme
Solutions Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT in ITA (TP) A No. 85/B/2016 for assessment year
2011-12 remanded this company for fresh consideration to Ld. AO/TPO. Following
the same, we also direct this company to be set-aside to Ld.AO/TPO for fresh
consideration of comparability the lines indicated in these cases. Accordingly
this comparable stand set aside for fresh consideration.
3.4. Ground no.9 (Aeessee appeal) &Ground no.3 (Revenue appeal):
As these grounds raised by assessee as well as revenue are in relation to same
issue they are taken up together.
Ld.AR also submitted that upholding working capital adjustment being
restricted at 1.63% is against view taken by various decisions of this
Tribunal. He submitted that Ld.TPO is duty bound to give adjustment based on
difference in economic, geographical condition, compared with that of assessee
in actual is without any. He placed reliance on various decisions of
coordinate bench of this Tribunal where, Ld.TPO is directed to provide working
capital adjustment by taking actual data, without putting any upper limit.
25
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 3.4.1. Ld.CIT
DR submitted that DRP provided risk adjustment at 1% on ad hoc basis without
having a scientific approach. She submitted that there are various factors
that needs to be considered for providing risk adjustment which assessee has
to establish in its case having regards to comparables finally selected. She
placed reliance upon VM global Technology Services (India) Pvt.Ltd vs ACIT
reported in (2018) 91 taxman.com 403 in support of her contention. We have
perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed before
us.
3.4.2.We have perused orders passed by authorities below on the basis of
records placed before us.
It is noted that working capital adjustment has been restricted by Ld.TPO and
upheld by DRP at 1.63% which is contrary to provisions of transfer pricing
rules. As held by various decisions of coordinate benches of this Tribunal, we
direct Ld.TPO to recompute working capital adjustment in actual, and to
consider the same for purposes of computing arm's length margin as per the
view expressed by this Tribunal in case of Huawei Technologies India Pvt. Ltd
vs JCIT reported in (2019) 101 taxman.com 313.
3.4.3 As regards the risk adjustment on ad hoc basis at 1%, it is observed
that there is no scientific manner which has been applied by DRP. Assessee is
a low risk bearing company for ITES segment and bears certain amount of
entrepreneurial risk under SWD segment. Therefore while computing risk
adjustment risks assumed by the comparables for earning revenue under
particular segment  26 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016
A.Y:2011-12 needs to be analysed. Assessee is directed to provide for
necessary details in respect of all the comparables finally selected. If that
information is insufficient, it is beyond the power of Assessee to produce
correct information about comparable companies. Revenue on the other hand has
sufficient powers u/s.133(6) to compel production of required details from
comparable companies. If this power is not exercised to find to get
information required, then it is no defense to say that Assessee has not
furnished required details to deny any adjustment on account of working
capital/risk differences. Ld.AO/TPO shall then compute risk as adjustment in
accordance with law.
Accordingly, Ground No. 9 of assessee's appeal and Ground No. 3 of revenue's
appeal stands allowed for statistical purposes. 3.5. Ground no.10-11(assessee
appeal) These grounds are in respect of interest on receivables outstanding as
on 31/03/11 for a period of more than 6 months amounting to Rs.55,57,84,049/-
in relation to transaction with AE. Ld. AO/TPO characterised the outstanding
receivables to be loan transaction on which no to notional interest to the
extent of Rs.7,48,08,532/-was charged.
3.5.1. From TP study, it is observed that payments to assessee are not
contingent upon payment received by AEs from their respective customers.
Further Ld.Counsel submitted that working capital adjustment undertaken by
assessee includes the adjustment regarding the receivables and thus
receivables arising out of such  27 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO
No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 transaction have already been accounted for.
Alternatively, he submitted that working capital subsumes sundry creditors and
therefore separate addition is not called for. 3.5.1. Ld.TPO computed interest
on outstanding receivables at the rate equal to 13.46 % on the receivables
that exceeded 6 months. It has been argued by Ld.AR that authorities below
disregarded business/commercial arrangement between the assessee and its AE's,
by holding outstanding receivables to be an independent international
transaction.
3.5.2. Ld.AR placed reliance on decision of Delhi Tribunal in Kusum Healthcare
Pvt.Ltd vs. ACIT reported in (2015) 62 Taxmann.com 79, deleted addition by
considering the above principle, and subsequently Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
Pr. CIT vs. Kusum Health Care Pvt. Ltd. (2017) 398 ITR 66 (Del), held that no
interest could have been charged as it cannot be considered as international
transaction. He also placed reliance upon decision of Delhi Tribunal in case
of Bechtel India vs DCIT reported in (2016) 66 taxman.com 6 which subsequently
upheld by Hon'able Delhi High Court vide order dated 21/07/16 in ITA No.
379/2016, also upheld by Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 21/07/17, in
CC No. 4956/2017. 3.5.3. It has been submitted by Ld.AR that outstanding
receivables are closely linked to main transaction and so the same cannot be
considered as separate international transaction. He also submitted that into
company agreements provides for extending credit period with mutual consent
and it does not provide any interest clause in  28 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA
no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 case of delay. He also argued that
the working capital adjustment takes into account the factors related to
delayed receivables and no separate adjustment is required in such
circumstances. 3.5.4. On the contrary Ld.CIT.DR submitted that interest on
receivables is an international transaction and Ld.TPO rightly determined its
ALP. In support of her contentions, she placed reliance on decision of Delhi
Tribunal order in Ameriprise India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT (2015- TII-347-ITAT-DEL-
TP) wherein it is held that, interest on receivables is an international
transaction and the transfer pricing adjustment is warranted. He stated that
Finance Act, 2012 inserted Explanation to Section 92B, with retrospective
effect from 1.4.2002 and sub-clause (c) of clause (i) of this Explanation
provides that:
(i) the expression "international transaction" shall include--
> ...... (c) capital financing, including any type of long-term or short-term
> borrowing, lending or guarantee, purchase or sale of marketable securities
> or any type of advance, payments or deferred payment or receivable or any
> other debt arising during the course of business;....' .
3.5.5. Ld.CIT DR submitted that expression 'debt arising during the course of
business' refers to trading debt arising from sale of goods or services
rendered in course of carrying on business. Once any debt arising during
course of business is an international transaction, he submitted that any
delay in realization of same needs to be considered within transfer pricing
adjustment, on account of interest income short charged or uncharged. It was
29 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 argued
that insertion of Explanation with retrospective effect covers assessment year
under consideration and hence under/non- payment of interest by AEs on debt
arising during course of business becomes international transactions, calling
for computing its ALP. He referred to decision of Delhi Tribunal in Ameriprise
(supra), in which this issue has been discussed at length and eventually
interest on trade receivables has been held to be an international
transaction. Referring to discussion in said order, it was stated that Hon'ble
Delhi Bench in this case noted a decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
the case of CIT vs. Patni Computer Systems Ltd., (2013) 215 Taxmann 108
(Bom.), which dealt with question of law:
(c) `Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the
Tribunal did not err in holding that the loss suffered by the assessee by
allowing excess period of credit to the associated enterprises without
charging an interest during such credit period would not amount to
international transaction whereas section 92B(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961
refers to any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income,
losses or assets of such enterprises?' 3.5.6. She submitted that, while
answering above question, Hon'ble Bombay High Court referred to amendment to
section 92B by Finance Act, 2012 with retrospective effect from 1.4.2002.
Setting aside view taken by Tribunal, Hon'ble Bombay High Court restored the
issue to file of Tribunal for fresh decision in light of legislative
amendment. It was thus argued that non/under-charging of interest on excess
period of credit allowed to AEs for realization of invoices, amounts to an
international transaction and ALP of such  30 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA
no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 international transaction has to be
determined by Ld.TPO. In so far as charging of rate of interest is concerned,
he relied on decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in CIT vs. Cotton
Naturals (I) Pvt. Ltd (2015) 276 CTR 445 (Del) holding that currency in which
such amount is to be re-paid, determines rate of interest. He, therefore,
concluded by summing up that interest on outstanding trade receivables is an
international transaction and its ALP has been correctly determined.
3.5.7. We have perused the submissions advanced by both the sides in the light
of the records placed before us. This Bench referred to decision of Special
Bench of this Tribunal in case of Special Bench of ITAT in case of
Instrumentation Corpn. Ltd. v. Asstt. DIT in ITA No. 1548 and 1549 (Kol.) of
2009, dated 15- 7-2016, held that outstanding sum of invoices is akin to loan
advanced by assessee to foreign AE., hence it is an international transaction
as per explanation to section 92 B of the Act. We also perused decision relied
upon by Ld.AR. In our considered opinion, these are factually distinguishable
and thus, we reject argument advanced by Ld.AR.
3.5.7. Alternatively, it has been argued that working capital adjustment
subsumes sundry creditors. In such situation computing interest on outstanding
receivables and lones and advances to international transaction would amount
to double taxation. Hon'ble Delhi Tribunal in case of Orange Business Services
India Solutions  31 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016
A.Y:2011-12 Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA No. 6570/Del/2016 vide its order dated
15.2.2018 has observed that:
"There may be a delay in collection of monies for supplies made, even beyond
the agreed limit, due to a variety of factors which would have to be
investigated on a case to case basis. Importantly, the impact this would have
on the working capital of the assessee would have to be studied. It went on to
hold that, there has to be a proper inquiry by the TPO by analysing the
statistics over a period of time to discern a pattern which would indicate
that vis-à-vis the receivables for the supplies made to an AE, the arrangement
reflected an international transaction intended to benefit the AE in some way.
Similar matter once again came up for consideration before the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in Avenue Asia Advisors Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT (2017) 398 ITR 120
(Del). Following the earlier decision in Kusum Healthcare (supra), it was
observed that there are several factors which need to be considered before
holding that every receivable is an international transaction and it requires
an assessment on the working capital of the assessee. Applying the decision in
Kusum Health Care (supra), the Hon'ble High Court directed the TPO to study
the impact of the receivables appearing in the accounts of the assessee;
looking into the various factors as to the reasons why the same are shown as
receivables and also as to whether the said transactions can be characterized
as international transactions."
3.5.8. In view of the above, we deem it appropriate to set aside the impugned
order on this issue and remit the matter to the file of the Assessing
Officer/TPO for deciding it in conformity with the above referred judgment.
Needless to say, the assessee will be allowed a reasonable opportunity of
being heard in such fresh proceedings. Accordingly these ground raised by
assessee stands allowed for statistical purposes.
32
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 3.6.Ground
No. 12 is against non-granting of TDS credit claimed by assessee while filing
its return of income. Ld.TPO/AO is directed to verify the same and granted
accordance with law. Assessee is directed to furnish requisite
information/details in support of its claim.
Needless to say that proper opportunity in accordance with law shall be
granted to assessee.
Accordingly, this ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
3.7. Ground No. 13-14 raised by assessee are consequential in nature and
therefore do not require adjudication. Accordingly appeal filed by assessee
stands allowed as indicated hereinabove.
Revenue's appeal
4\. Ground no 1 (Revenue appeal) This ground is in respect of excluding
expenses incurred in foreign currency from export turnover while computing
deduction under section 10A/AA of the Act.
4.1. Ld.AR submitted that, consistently this Tribunal following decision of
Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case of Tata Elxsi Ltd vs CIT reported in 349
ITR 98 has been granting deduction. Ld.CIT DR placed reliance upon orders
passed by authorities below. 4.2. We have perused submissions advanced by both
sides in light of records placed before us.
33
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 It is
observed that DRP while considering the issue referred to view of Hon'ble
Karnataka High Court in case of Tata Elxsi Ltd vs CIT (supra), directed Ld.AO
to follow the view taken therein, while computing deduction under section 10 A
of the Act. 4.3. We do not find any infirmity in such directions. Ld.AO to
recompute export turnover in the light of ratio laid down by Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court in case of Tata Elxsi Ltd vs CIT (supra). Accordingly this ground
raised by revenue stands dismissed.
5\. Ground No. 2 (revenue appeal) Assessee claimed deduction of Rs.94,53,053/-
as expenses towards purchase of licenses for computer software used primarily
as application software for various projects undertaken by it. It was
submitted that assessee treated the expenses as revenue in nature and claimed
deduction of entire amount. But authorities below did not agree and held that
expenses are capital and therefore deserves to be disallowed. Ld.AR submitted
that DRP observed that identical issue was considered during assessment years
2007-08 and 2008- 09 wherein similar expenses on identical facts have been
held to be revenue in nature. DRP accordingly directed Ld.AO to grant the
claim as expenditure under section 37 of the Act. 5.1. Ld. CIT DR placed
reliance upon orders of authorities below. 5.2. We have perused submissions
advanced by both sides in light of records placed before us.
It is observed that DRP directed Ld.AO to grant the deduction claimed by
assessee as revenue, however Ld.AO failed to follow the directions.
34
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 It is
observed that DRP following the view taken by this Tribunal in preceding years
in assessee's own case held the expenditure to be allowable in the hands of
assessee. It has been submitted by Ld.AR that this view is supported by
another decision of coordinate benches of this Tribunal in case of IBM India
Pvt.Ltd. vs CIT reported in (2007) 290 ITR (AT) 183 (Bang) and Amway India
Enterprises vs DCIT reported in (2008) 301 ITR (AT) 1 (Del).
Respectfully following the same, we direct Ld.AO to grant deduction claimed by
assessee under section 37 of the Act. Accordingly, this ground raised by
revenue stands dismissed.
6\. Ground No. 4-5 (revenue appeal), additional ground raised by revenue and
CO filed by assessee.
Revenue by way of additional ground challenges exclusion of comparables merely
on turnover filter without analysing the functions of comparables with that of
assessee. Assessee by way of cross objection is in support of exclusion of
these comparables on non-satisfaction of turnover filter on the ground that it
is a settled principle to exclude the comparables which are with high turnover
and cannot be compared with a captive service provider like assessee 6.1. In
Revised Additional Ground, revenue is challenging exclusion of following
comparables on turnover filter by DRP. SWD Segment Acropetal Technologies Ltd,

Ld.CIT DR at the outset submitted that DRP rejected comparables by following
certain decisions without considering the FAR analysis. Ld.CIT DR placing
reliance on decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of Chryscapital
Investment Advisory (India) Pvt.Ltd vs DCIT, reported in 56 Taxmann.com 417
(2015) submitted that, this filter cannot be the sole criteria to reject
comparables. She submitted that such filter is not prescribed under IT Rules,
as one, which is to be applied while determining arms length price of
international transaction. Ld.CIT DR placed reliance on orders passed by
Ld.AO/TPO. She relied upon following decisions of this Tribunal in support of
her contention:
 NTT Data Global Delivery Services Ltd. vs ACIT reported in (2016) 59
Taxmann.com 7;
 LSI Technologies India Pvt.Ltd vs ITO reported in (2016) 70 Taxmann.com 189;

ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 6.3. Ld.CIT
DR relied upon decision of co-ordinate Bench of this Tribunal in case of
Mercedes-Benz research and development India private limited vs ACIT reported
in (2018) 90 Taxmann.com 300 and submitted that these comparables were sent
back to Ld.TPO for re- examination. She thus submitted that, the view taken by
coordinate bench of this Tribunal in Mercedes-Benz research and development
India private limited vs ACIT (supra) may be followed. 6.4. On the contrary
Ld.AR placed reliance upon decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in
case of Genesis Integrating Systems India (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2012)
20 taxman.com 715. He submitted that this Tribunal in case of Autodesk India
(P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in (2018) 96 Taxmann.com 263 (Bang) expressed a view
that turnover is a relevant criteria for determining comparability of
comparable entity and the tested party. He also relied upon decision of
Hon'able Karnataka High Court in case of Acuses software India (P) Ltd vs ITU
reported in submitted by (2018) 98 Taxmann.com 183, wherein applicability of
turnover filter has been upheld. 6.5. We have perused submissions advanced by
both sides in light of records placed before us.
It is observed that companies engaged in software development services are
treated by both sides as comparables irrespective of various verticals of
software. Ld.TPO as well as assessee searched for comparables, which are
engaged in software development services, but has not consider
verticals/functional or service lines, in which the company is engaged. Thus
it is observed that comparables  37 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO
No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 selected are into different verticals and functional
lines, though assessee is catering to software development and maintenance
needs of the group and has been characterized as captive software development
service provider. In Genesis Integrating Systems India (P) Ltd vs DCIT
(supra), this Tribunal observed as under:
> "9. Having heard both the parties and having considered the rival
> contentions and also the judicial precedents on the issue, we find that the
> TPO himself has rejected the companies which are making losses as
> comparables. This shows that there is a limit for the lower end for
> identifying the comparables. In such a situation, we are unable to
> understand as to why there should not be an upper limit also. What should be
> upper limit is another factor to be considered. We agree with the contention
> of the learned counsel for the assessee that the size matters in business. A
> big company would be in a position to bargain the price and also attract
> more customers. It would also have a broad base of skilled employees who are
> able to give better output. A small company may not have these benefits and
> therefore, the turnover also would come down reducing profit margin. Thus,
> as held by the various benches of the Tribunal, when companies which are
> loss making are excluded from comparables, then the super profit making
> companies should also be excluded. For the purpose of classification of
> companies on the basis of net sales or turnover, we find that a reasonable
> classification has to be made. Dun & Bradstreet and NASSCOM have given
> different ranges. Taking the Indian scenario into consideration, we feel
> that the classification made by Dun & Bradstreet is more suitable and
> reasonable. In view of the same, we hold that the turnover filter is very
> important and the companies having a turnover of Rs.1.00 core to 200 crores
> have to be taken as a particular range and the assessee being in that range
> having turnover of 8.15 crores, the companies which also have turnover of
> 1.00 to 200.00 crores only should be taken into consideration for the
> purpose of making TP study."
6.6. In facts of present case, assessee is doing part of software development
cycle under the guidance of its AE's and therefore has been categorised as a
captive software development service provider catering to needs of the group.
Assessee in TP study held to be comprise of Software Engineers, who develop
project based on inputs  38 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO
No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 received from AE. Engineers employed by assessee
designs functional specifications for the project identification of interfaces
components coding and bug fixing. Ultimate approval and owner of project
developed is the AE. In our view, by involving itself in process of Software
development for AE, assessee cannot be held to be fulfledged Software
Development Company. One has to look into transaction in regards to services
rendered and FAR, which catagorises it to be a captive service provider,
working on business model of cost plus margin.
6.7. It is observed that comparables sought to be excluded are 100 % Software
Development Companies, having high turnover and therefore respectfully
following aforestated view in case of Genesis Integrating Systems India Pvt.
Ltd., vs DCIT (supra) these comparables are to be excluded on both the counts
of functionally not being similar with that of assessee and also because they
have a high turnover. It is submitted that subsequently this Tribunal in case
of Yodlee Infotech Pvt. Ltd vs ITO in IT(TP)A no. 108/Bang/2014 For assessment
year 2009-10, vide order dated 12/12/14, excluded these companies following
Genesis Integrating systems Indi Pvt.Ltd vs.DCIT(supra). Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in case of Chriscapital (supra), Hon'ble Court was of the opinion that
assessee could not challenge functional differences before the court for first
time and that assessee had included one of the companies in its earlier year.
In the present case facts are not similar to that of Chriscapital (supra).
39
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 6.8. Reliance
is placed on decision of this Tribunal in case of Autodesk India Pvt.Ltd. vs
DCIT reported in (2018) 96 Taxmann.com 263, where this Tribunal followed
similar view to exclude identical comparables by applying turnover filter,
wherein all decisions relied upon by Ld. CIT DR has been considered and dealt
with.
6.9. However, we have also analysed functional similarities/dissimilarities of
these comparables with assessee having regard to annual reports placed in
Index to Annual report paper book Volume I & II. Comparables like Acropetal
Technologies Ltd., e-zest Solutions Ltd., E-Infichips, ICRA Techno Analytics
Ltd., Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd., Persistant Systems and solutions Ltd.,
Mindtree Ltd., iGate Global Solutions Ltd., do not have segmental details
available. Also that these comparables are either having diversified functions
with no segmental details or into product sales or into consultancy services.
Further, where the comparables are into product sales, there is presence of
huge intangibles, which is not at all the case with assessee.
6.10. We have perused view of co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in case of
Mercedes-Benz research and development India private limited (supra) in
respect of Accropatel Technologies Ltd and L&T Infotech Ltd. It is observed
that these comparables were sent back to Ld.TPO 6.11. For the reason that DRP
there in noted the comparables having segmental details which was opposed by
assessee. We have perused annual reports of these comparables in detail and
are of opinion that  40 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016
A.Y:2011-12 segmental informations are not available. We therefore do not find
force in argument raised by Ld.CIT DR.
Infosys BPO In so far as Infosys BPO is concerned, this company has huge brand
value. Tribunal in case of Zyme Solutions Pvt Ltd., vs ACIT vide order dated
28/06/19 in ITA (TP) a No. 1661/Bang/2016, wherein this comparable has been
excluded by observing as under:
'5. We have heard the rival submissions on the comparability of Infosys BPO as
a comparable company. The Delhi ITAT in the case of Baxter India Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
ACIT ITA No.6158/Del/2016 for AY 2012-13 in the case of a company rendering
ITES such as the Assessee, vide order dated 24.8.2017 Paragraph 23 held that
Infosys BPO is not comparable with a company rendering ITES for the following
reasons:- "23. In so far as exclusion of Infosys BPO Ltd. is concerned, we
find from the submissions made by the assessee before the Assessing
Officer/TPO/DRP is that Infosys BPO Ltd. is predominantly into areas like
Insurance, Banking, Financial Services, Manufacturing and Telecom which are in
the niche areas, unlike the assessee. Further it was also submitted that the
Infosys BPQ Ltd. comprises brand value which will tend to influence its
business operation and the pricing policy thereby directly impacting the
margins earned by the Infosys BPO Ltd.. We find the submissions of the ld.
counsel for the assessee before TPO/DRP that in order to maintain the brand
image of Infosys BPQ Ltd. in the market, the company incurs substantial
selling and marketing expenditure whereas the assessee being a contract
service provider does not incur such expenses to maintain its brand has not
been controverted by them. Further, Infosys BPO Ltd. being a subsidiary of
Infosys has an element of brand value associated with it. This can be further
confirmed by the presence of brand related expenses incurred by Infosys BPO
Ltd. Further, Infosys BPO Ltd. has acquired Australian based company M/s
Portland  41 ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12
Group Pty Ltd. during financial year 2011-12. They provide sourcing and
category management services in Sydney, Australia. Therefore, this company
also failed the TPO's own filter of rejecting companies with peculiar
circumstances. In view of the above i.e. functionally not comparable, presence
of brand and extraordinary event that has taken place during the year on
account of acquisition of Australian based company, we are of the considered
opinion that Infosys BPO Ltd. should not be included in the list of
comparables. We accordingly direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude
Infosys BPO Ltd. from the list of comparables for the purpose of computing the
average margin." It was also brought to our notice that the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in ITA No.260/2018 in the appeal filed by the Revenue against the
aforesaid order dismissed the appeal at the admission stage observing that
rationale given by the ITAT for exclusion was correct. In view of the
aforesaid decision, we direct exclusion of Infosys BPO from the list of
comparable companies chosen by the TPO. From above, it is clear that this
company is functionally not comparable with captive service provider and hence
deservs to be excluded.
We are therefore do not find any infirmity in exclusion of these comparables
for high turnover. However we have analysed the alledged comparable to be
functionallt not comparable with that of assessee.
Accordingly we direct Ld.AO/TPO to exclude, Acropetal Technologies Ltd, eZest
Solutions Ltd., E-Infochips Ltd, Evoke Tech Pvt.Ltd, ICRA Techno Analytics
Ltd, Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd, Persistent Systems and Solutions Ltd., in
SWD segment. And Infosys BPO Ltd., Mindtree Ltd, iGate Global Soutions Ltd.,
in ITES Segment.
42
ITA No.505/B/2016 ITA no.626/B/2016 CO No.146/B/2016 A.Y:2011-12 RS software
(India) Ltd It is observed that RS software (India) Ltd, has been excluded by
DRP for high turnover. However we find that turnover of this company is less
than 200 crores. Ld.AR did not object this comparable to be included and no
submissions has been advanced for its exclusion. Under such circumstances, we
direct Ld.AO/TPO to include this comparable in the final list.
Accordingly, Ground no, 4-5, Revised additional ground and Cross objection
filed by assessee stands disposed off as indicated above.
In the result appeal and cross objection filed by assessee stands allowed as
indicated hereinabove. Appeal filed by revenue stands dismissed.
