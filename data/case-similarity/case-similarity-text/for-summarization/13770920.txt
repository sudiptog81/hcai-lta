Civil Procedure.
16\. The very basis for the GHMC to issue the impugned notice in W.P.No.22184
of 2009 is the order under review. Since this Court is of the considered view
that the order under review is liable to be reviewed, the impugned notice in
W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is of no consequence and becomes inoperative. In view of
these orders, this Court is of the view that no orders need be passed in
W.P.M.P.No.3495 of 2013 in W.P.No.22184 of 2009\. In view of the principles
laid down in the above referred judgments, the contention of the learned
senior counsel that the present review is not maintainable in view of the
dismissal of the review filed by the official respondents is not at all
sustainable and tenable and this Court cannot remain as a silent spectator for
the contingencies of this nature.
17\. For the aforesaid reasons and having regard to the principles laid down
by the Honble Supreme Court in the judgments referred to above, the review
petition is allowed and the order passed in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated
13.8.2007 stands reviewed and consequently W.P.No.11681 of 2000 is dismissed
5\. (2000) 1 SCC 533 THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE A.V.SESHA SAI Review W.P.M.P (SR)
No.166975 of 2013 in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 & W.P.No.22184 of 2009 COMMON ORDER:
Since the subject matter in Review in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 and W.P.No.22184 of
2009 is the same and the issues are inter-related, this Court deems it
appropriate to dispose of these two cases by way of this common order.
2\. The facts and circumstances, leading to the filing of the review petition
in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 are as follows:
2.1 Respondents 1 to 4 in the review who are no more now filed W.P.No.11681 of
2000, seeking to declare the land acquisition proceedings initiated vide draft
notification and draft declaration dated 4.6.1975 and 25.5.1978 issued under
Sections 4(1) and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as lapsed to the extent
of the land, admeasuring Ac.1.22 guntas situated in S.Nos.572 (Ac.0.07 gts.),
611 (0.21 gts.) and 612 (0.34 gts.) of Bagh Amberpet village, Hyderabad.
2.2 This Court, by way of an order dated 13.8.2007, allowed the said writ
petition and the operative portion of the said order reads as under:
Hence, this Court is of the view that the Notification dated 5.6.1975 issued
under Section 4(1) of the Act insofar as the lands of the petitioners are
concerned is hereby quashed. If the respondents so chose, they may issue a
fresh Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, complete the entire land
acquisition proceedings and pay compensation to the petitioners as fixed by
the Land Acquisition Officer, otherwise, the lands shall be re- delivered to
the petitioners. This exercise shall be done within a period of eight weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
2.3 Seeking review of the above said order, the present review application
under Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 114 CPC has been filed, raising a
number of grounds. Resisting the review, a counter affidavit has been filed by
the Respondents 12, 13 and 14 who are the legal representatives of the
deceased 3rd petitioner in W.P.No.11681 of 2000.
3\. Coming to W.P.No.22184 of 2009, it is a writ petition filed by the review
petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000, questioning the proceedings of the
Additional Commissioner (Estates), GHMC, Hyderabad bearing
LR.No.63/EO/E1/GHMC/2009 dated 19.6.2009 issued obviously as a consequence of
the orders of this Court in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated 13.8.2007 which are the
subject matter of the review now. This court, while issuing rule nisi, on
15.10.2009 in W.P.M.P.No.28807 of 2009 granted order of status quo with
respect to the possession of the parties. Responding to the rule nisi issued
by this Court, a counter affidavit dated 13.4.2011 is filed on behalf of
Respondents 2 and 3/GHMC. A reply dated 12.7.2011 is also filed by the
petitioners in W.P.No.22184 of 2009.
4\. Contentions of Sri Vedula Srinivas, learned counsel for review petitioners
in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 and petitioners in W.P.No.22184 of 2009  4.1
W.P.No.11681 of 2000 was filed by the petitioners therein by suppressing the
facts and by making wrong submissions before this Court and the said writ
petition was decided on the basis of the assertions made by the writ
petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 and this Court was kept in dark regarding
the facts pertaining to the land acquisition by the GHMC under G.O.Rt.No.68
dated 4.6.1975.
4.2 The entire land acquisition proceedings, relating to construction of
housing project by HUDCO was eventually upheld by the Honble Apex Court and
the petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 are estopped from questioning the said
proceedings and the land acquisition proceedings initiated vide draft
notification dated 4.6.1975 was questioned after a lapse of 25 years and the
said delay was not properly explained by the petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of
2000\.
4.3 This Court failed to take note of the issues concluded before the Honble
Supreme Court, which resulted in miscarriage of justice.
4.4 This Court was not apprised of the facts that the entire land under
acquisition had been made into plots and the same had been allotted to the
beneficiaries and the possession had also been delivered.
4.5 The petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 did not intentionally implead the
review petitioners in the said writ petition.
4.6 There was no inordinate delay in passing of the award and the matter was
pending before the Courts for more than two decades.
4.7 This Court was kept in dark about the representation submitted by the
petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated 20.10.1999 addressed to the
Principal Secretary to Government, Housing and Municipal Administration
Department, saying that their land admeasuring Ac.1.22 gts. also forms part of
the land in respect of which the Honble Supreme Court passed orders on
14.9.1999.
5\. To bolster his submissions, the learned counsel for the review petitioners
and the petitioners in W.P.No.22184 of 2009 places reliance on the judgments
of the Honble Supreme Court in Hamza Haji v. State of Kerala , State of A.P.
v. T.Suryachandra Rao and S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by L.Rs. v.
Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs. .
6\. Contentions of Sri P.Sri Raghuram, learned senior counsel 6.1.
W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is not maintainable as the petitioners therein, by way of
amendment in W.P.M.P.No.3495 of 2013, are seeking to assail the earlier orders
of this Court in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated 13.8.2007 and this Court has no
jurisdiction to set aside the said earlier orders.
6.2. There is absolutely no fraud as alleged by the review petitioners nor it
is a case of suppression of any information and in fact the subject land is
not a part of the entire extent.
6.3. There is no estoppel against the title and the representation dated
20.10.1999 made is of no consequence nor has any impact on the adjudication of
the present issue before this Court.
6.4. The award in the instant case is manipulated.
6.5. The review earlier filed by the Government vide W.P.M.P.No.29679 of 2007
was dismissed and the present review is a typical example of abuse of process
of law.
6.6. In support of his case, the learned senior counsel places reliance on the
judgments of the Honble Supreme Court in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra &
another .
7\. Contentions of Sri R.Radhakrishna Reddy, learned Standing Counsel for
GHMC.
7.1 The very basis for issuing the impugned notice in W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is
the order passed by this Court in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 and the GHMC is
strictly adhering to the directions of this Court.
8\. In the light of the respective pleadings, contentions and submissions, now
the questions which boil down for consideration of this Court are;
(i) Whether the review petitioners herein have made out a case, warranting any
interference of this Court under the provisions of Order 47 Rule 1 read with
Section 114 of CPC ?
(ii) Whether the review application is maintainable ?
(iii) Whether the review petitioners/petitioners in W.P.No.22184 of 2009 are
entitled for any relief from this Court ?
9\. The material available on record reveals that the State Government pressed
into service the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter called
the Act) and issued a draft notification under sub- Section (1) of Section 4
of the Act vide G.O.Rt.No.68 Health, Housing and Municipal Administration
Department dated 4.6.1975 for the purpose of acquiring a total extent of
Ac.21.00 gts. situated in Sy.Nos.567/1, 567/2, 615, 561, 563, 560, 564, 566,
568, 569, 570/1, 571, 572, 611, 612, 613, 614 and 578 of Bagh Amberpet
village, Hyderabad for housing project under HUDCO scheme at the instance of
Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad. Thereafter, the State Government issued a
draft declaration under Section 6 of the Act for an extent of Ac.20-33 gts.
vide G.O.Rt.No.41, Housing, Municipal Administration and Urban Development
Department dated 25.4.1978. The review petitioners society which came into
being on 15.4.1981 paid a sum of Rs.40,20,649/- to the MCH towards the cost of
the land of Ac.20.33 gts. under acquisition. One Tulasi Cooperative Society in
whose favour an agreement of sale was said to have been executed by the
original owner Sri Syed Azam and Sri Syed Azam himself filed W.P.Nos.4485 &
5360 of 1981 before this Court questioning the proceedings initiated under the
provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. In W.P.No.4455 of 1981, the review
petitioner herein was arrayed as Respondent No.3 and by virtue of judgment
dated 28.1.1982, the said cases were dismissed by this Court holding the
proceedings as valid. As against the said judgment, W.A.Nos.170 and 171 of
1982 were filed and the same were allowed by a Full Bench of this Court on
2.3.1983, quashing the draft notification and draft declaration. As against
the same, Civil Appeal Nos.5784-85 of 1983 were filed by the petitioners and
in the meanwhile the State Government, vide G.O.Ms.No.946 dated 23.6.1983,
cancelled the exemption granted earlier in favour of Syed Azam vide
G.O.Ms.No.4293 dated 11.9.1980 under Section 20(1)(a) of the Urban Land
Ceiling Act, 1976. W.P.No.5498 of 1983 filed by Syed Azam against the said
order was dismissed on 30.6.1988 on the ground of pendency of above Civil
Appeals before the Honble Supreme Court. Subsequently, S.L.P (Civil) No.1679
of 1989 was filed against the said order before the Honble Apex Court and
W.P.No.6500 of 1983 before this Court was also transferred to the Supreme
Court and an order was passed by the Honble Supreme Court on 17.8.1990,
remanding the matters back to this Court and after remand, this Court passed
orders dismissing W.A.Nos.170 and 171 of 1982 and disposing of W.P.Nos.6500
and 5498 of 1983 vide orders dated 21.11.1992 and the operative portion of the
said orders reads as under:
1\. The land acquisition proceedings covered by the Section 4(1) notification
issued in G.O.Rt.No.68 dated 4.6.1975 in respect of Ac.18-03 guntas of land
shall revive and be completed as expeditiously as possible preferably within
three months from today, the beneficiaries being the 374 members of the Bagh
Amberpet Welfare Association who have already remitted a total sum of
Rs.40,20,649.04.
2\. The compensation amount the land owners are entitled to, shall be limited
only to Rs.25,49,131.75 and nothing more.
3\. M/s Tulsi Cooperative Housing Society is at liberty to work out its rights
vis--vis the land owners.
4\. The applications filed under Section 20 of the ULC Act seeking exemptions
from the operation of the Act and now pending with the Government since 1976
shall be dispose dof as indicated supra.
The two statements containing the details about the payment of compensation
under the L.A. Act and the ULC Act enclosed to the Government Memorandum
No.1472/UC.II/1(1)/83-12 dated 16.10.1992 addressed to the Government Pleader
shall form part of the record.
10\. The above said orders were challenged by Tulsi Cooperative Housing
Society and Syed Azam before the Honble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal
Nos.6986-87 of 1994, 6988-91 of 1994 and 6992-93 of 1994 and the same were
disposed of by the Honble Supreme Court vide judgment dated 14.9.1999,
reported in Tulsi Cooperative Housing Society, Hyderabad and others v. State
of A.P. and others and the operative portion of the said judgment at paragraph
27 reads as follows:
(I) The directions contained in the judgment of the High Court are set aside;
(II) The land acquisition proceedings covered by the Notification under
Section 4(1) of the Acquisition Act issued in G.O. Rt. No. 68 dated 4.6.75 in
respect of 18 acres 03 guntas of land stand revived and shall be completed as
expeditiously as possible within a period of three months from today;
(III) The concerned authorities constituted under Acquisition Act shall decide
the compensation payable to the land owner in accordance with the provisions
of the Act.;
(IV) The Government shall nominate a Committee comprising at least three
Secretaries to the Government for distributing the acquired land equitably
among deserving persons in order to carry out the purposes of the acquisition
and to balance the equities between various persons whether they belong to one
or the other society or are not members of either society.;
(V) M/s. Tulsi Cooperative Housing Society is at liberty to work out its
rights as against the land owner in appropriate proceedings; (VI) Applications
under Section 20 of the Ceiling Act seeking exemption from the operation of
the Act said to be pending with the Government since 1976 shall be disposed of
in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a
period of three months from today.
11\. Thereafter, the Special Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition, MCH passed an
award vide proceedings A2/452/79 dated 22.6.2000, referring the matter under
Sections 30 and 31(2) of the Land Acquisition Act to the City Civil Court,
Hyderabad for determination of title and payment of the awarded amount to the
rightful owners. A perusal of the award placed before this Court, in clear and
unequivocal terms, discloses the participation of the petitioners in
W.P.No.11681 of 2000 during award proceedings. The said reference was numbered
as L.A.O.P.No.19 of 2000 on the file of the Court of the I Senior Civil Judge,
City Civil Court, Hyderabad. The petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 figured
as Claimant Nos.25, 19, 14 and 15 respectively and the Claimant Nos.3, 6, 11,
12, 13, 16 and 17 contested the said L.A.O.P.No.19 of 2000 and Claimant No.25
was the legal representative of Claimant No.11 who is petitioner No.1 in
W.P.No.11681 of 2000\. Eventually, by way of order dated 23.10.2007, the said
L.A.O.P.No.19 of 2000 was dismissed on the ground that the claimants failed to
prove their title to the property. Unfortunately, in the affidavit filed in
support of W.P.No.11681 of 2000, these particulars were not mentioned, which
obviously resulted in passing the order under review.
12\. Another significant aspect, which needs mention at this juncture is that
on 20.10.1999 the petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 submitted a
representation to the State Government and the last paragraph of the said
representation reads as under:
We, therefore pray the Government kindly to restrict the L.A. proceedings to
extent of Acres 16.28 belonging to Syed Azam and others leaving our land
admeasuring Acres 1.30 so that we the small farmers and poor citizens can make
a living as we have no other source and to meet the ends of justice if
necessary by filing an affidavit before the Supreme Court of India, for
amending the order of Supreme court of India, at 2nd instruction at page 24,
for deleting our land admeasuring to an extent of Acres 1.30 guntas out of
Acres 18.03 guntas, since the matter is sub-judice.
13\. The above said aspect also speaks volumes with regard to conduct and
bonafides on the part of the petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000. The above
narration manifestly and categorically demonstrates that even before
institution of W.P.No.11681 of 2000, the entire proceedings, including passing
of award and the orders in L.A.O.P.No.19 of 2000 attained finality. Absolutely
there is no plausible explanation forthcoming as to why these material
particulars were not furnished in the affidavit filed in support of
W.P.No.11681 of 2000.
14\. At this juncture, it may be appropriate to refer to the judgments relied
upon by the learned counsel for review petitioners in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 and
petitioners in W.P.No.22184 of 2009.
14.1 In Hamza Haji v. State of Kerala (1 supra), the Honble Supreme Court at
paragraphs 9 to 29 held as follows:
9\. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court had far
exceeded its jurisdiction and has acted illegally in setting aside the order
of the Forest Tribunal which had become final long back and which had been
given effect to, that too, by the intervention of the High Court. It is
submitted that the High Court had no jurisdiction or authority to set at
naught the two earlier orders of Division Benches of coequal strength and that
too at this belated stage and thus the order suffered from patent illegality.
On facts it was contended that the finding that the order was procured by the
appellant by playing a fraud on the Tribunal was not justified and no occasion
arose for the High Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 215 of the
Constitution of India, assuming it had such a jurisdiction to interfere with
the earlier orders. On behalf of the State it is contended by the learned
Senior Counsel that fraud vitiates everything, that if an order is vitiated by
fraud, it does not attain finality and it can be set at naught by a proper
proceeding and on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the High
Court was fully justified in setting aside the order of the Forest Tribunal.
It is submitted that the High Court has only followed the ratio of the
decisions of this Court and there is nothing illegal in the decision rendered
by the High Court. On facts, fraud was writ large and this was a case where
the High Court ought to have interfered and the interference made was fully
justified. Counsel further submitted that since the appellant had come with
unclean hands and had obtained a relief by playing a fraud on the Court, this
was a fit case where this Court should decline to exercise its discretionary
jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, sought to be
invoked by the appellant. It was submitted that the appeal deserved to be
dismissed.
10\. It is true, as observed by De Grey, C.J., in R. v. Duchess of Kingston1
that:
Fraud is an extrinsic, collateral act, which vitiates the most solemn
proceedings of courts of justice. Lord Coke says it avoids all judicial acts,
ecclesiastical and temporal.
11\. In Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, it is stated that: In applying this rule,
it matters not whether the judgment impugned has been pronounced by an
inferior or by the highest court of judicature in the realm, but in all cases
alike it is competent for every court, whether superior or inferior, to treat
as a nullity any judgment which can be clearly shown to have been obtained by
manifest fraud.
12\. It is also clear as indicated in Kinch v. Walcott2 that it would be in
the power of a party to a decree vitiated by fraud to apply directly to the
court which pronounced it to vacate it. According to Kerr:
In order to sustain an action to impeach a judgment, actual fraud must be
shown; mere constructive fraud is not, at all events after long delay,
sufficient but such a judgment will not be set aside upon mere proof that the
judgment was obtained by perjury. (See 7th Edn., pp. 416-17)
13\. In Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 49, para 265, it is acknowledged that:
Courts of record or of general jurisdiction have inherent power to vacate or
set aside their own judgments.
In para 269, it is further stated:
Fraud or collusion in obtaining judgment is a sufficient ground for opening or
vacating it, even after the term at which it was rendered, provided the fraud
was extrinsic and collateral to the matter tried and not a matter actually or
potentially in issue in the action. It is also stated:
Fraud practised on the court is always ground for vacating the judgment, as
where the court is deceived or misled as to material circumstances, or its
process is abused, resulting in the rendition of a judgment which would not
have been given if the whole conduct of the case had been fair.
14\. In American Jurisprudence, 2nd Edn., Vol. 46, para 825, it is stated:
Indeed, the connection of fraud with a judgment constitutes one of the chief
causes for interference by a court of equity with the operation of a judgment.
The power of courts of equity in granting such relief is inherent, and
frequent applications for equitable relief against judgments on this ground
were made in equity before the practice of awarding new trials was introduced
into the courts of common law.
Where fraud is involved, it has been held, in some cases, that a remedy at law
by appeal, error, or certiorari does not preclude relief in equity from the
judgment. Nor, it has been said, is there any reason why a judgment obtained
by fraud cannot be the subject of a direct attack by an action in equity even
though the judgment has been satisfied.
15\. The law in India is not different. Section 44 of the Evidence Act enables
a party otherwise bound by a previous adjudication to show that it was not
final or binding because it is vitiated by fraud. The provision therefore
gives jurisdiction and authority to a court to consider and decide the
question whether a prior adjudication is vitiated by fraud. In Paranjpe v.
Kanade3 it was held that: (ILR p. 148) It is always competent to any court to
vacate any judgment or order, if it be proved that such judgment or order was
obtained by manifest fraud;
16\. In Lakshmi Charan Saha v. Nur Ali4 it was held that: (ILR p.
936) [T]he jurisdiction of the Court in trying a suit [questioning the earlier
decision as being vitiated by fraud,] was not limited to an investigation
merely as to whether the plaintiff was prevented from placing his case
properly at the prior trial by the fraud of the defendant. The Court could and
must rip up the whole matter for determining whether there had been fraud in
the procurement of the decree.
17\. In Manindra Nath Mittra v. Hari Mondal5 the Court explained the elements
to be proved before a plea of a prior decision being vitiated by fraud could
be upheld. The Court said: (AIR p. 127) With respect to the question as to
what constitutes fraud for which a decree can be set aside, two propositions
appear to be well established. The first is that although it is not permitted
to show that the Court (in the former suit) was mistaken, it may be shown that
it was misled, in other words, where the Court has been intentionally misled
by the fraud of a party and a fraud has been committed upon the Court with the
intention to procure its judgment, it will vitiate its judgment. The second is
that a decree cannot be set aside merely on the ground that it has been
procured by perjured evidence:
18\. The position was reiterated by the same High Court in Esmile Uddin Biswas
v. Shajoran Nessa Bewa6. It was held that: (AIR p. 650) [I]t must be shown
that the fraud was practised in relation to the proceedings in Court and the
decree must be shown to have been procured by practising fraud of some sort,
upon the Court:
19\. In Nemchand Tantia v. Kishinchand Chellaram (India) Ltd.7 it was held
that: (CWN p. 740) A decree can be reopened by a new action when the court
passing it had been misled by fraud, but it cannot be reopened when the court
is simply mistaken; when the decree was passed by relying on perjured
evidence, it cannot be said that the court was misled.
20\. It is not necessary to multiply authorities on this question since the
matter has come up for consideration before this Court on earlier occasions.
In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath8 this Court stated that: (SCC p. 2,
para 1) It is the settled proposition of law that a judgment or decree
obtained by playing fraud on the court is a nullity and non est in the eye of
the law. Such a judgment/decreeby the first court or by the highest courthas
to be treated as a nullity by every court, whether superior or inferior. It
can be challenged in any court even in collateral proceedings.
The Court went on to observe that the High Court in that case was totally in
error when it stated that there was no legal duty cast upon the plaintiff to
come to the court with a true case and prove it by true evidence. Their
Lordships stated: (SCC p. 5, para 5) The courts of law are meant for imparting
justice between the parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean
hands. We are constrained to say that more often than not, process of the
court is being abused. Property-grabbers, tax-evaders, bank loan-dodgers and
other unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the court process a
convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely. We have no
hesitation to say that a person, whose case is based on falsehood, has no
right to approach the court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of
the litigation.
21\. In Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and Intermediate
Education9 this Court after quoting the relevant passage from Lazarus Estates
Ltd. v. Beasley10 and after referring to S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v.
Jagannath8 reiterated that fraud avoids all judicial acts. In State of A.P. v.
T. Suryachandra Rao11 this Court after referring to the earlier decisions held
that suppression of a material document could also amount to a fraud on the
Court. It also quoted (at SCC p. 155, para 16) the observations of Lord
Denning in Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley10 that: (All ER p. 345 C) No
judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has
been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything.
22\. According to Storys Equity Jurisprudence, 14th Edn., Vol. 1, para 263:
Fraud indeed, in the sense of a Court of Equity, properly includes all acts,
omissions, and concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable duty,
trust, or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or by
which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another.
23\. In Patch v. Ward12 Sir John Rolt, L.J. held that: Fraud must be actual
positive fraud, a meditated and intentional contrivance to keep the parties
and the court in ignorance of the real facts of the case, and obtaining that
decree by that contrivance.
24\. This Court in Bhaurao Dagdu Paralkar v. State of Maharashtra13 held that:
(SCC p. 607) Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud
on the court. Although, negligence is not fraud but it can be evidence on
fraud.
25\. Thus, it appears to be clear that if the earlier order from the Forest
Tribunal has been obtained by the appellant on perjured evidence, that by
itself would not enable the Court in exercise of its power of certiorari or of
review or under Article 215 of the Constitution of India, to set at naught the
earlier order. But if the court finds that the appellant had founded his case
before the Forest Tribunal on a false plea or on a claim which he knew to be
false and suppressed documents or transactions which had relevance in deciding
his claim, the same would amount to fraud. In this case, the appellant had
purchased an extent of about 55 acres in the year 1968 under Document No. 2685
of 1968 dated 2-6-1968. He had, even according to his evidence before the
Forest Tribunal, gifted 5 acres of land to his brother under a deed dated
30-1-1969. In addition, according to the State, he had sold, out of the extent
of 55.25 acres, an extent of 49.93 acres by various sale deeds during the
years 1971 and 1972. Though, the details of the sale deeds like the numbers of
the registered documents, the dates of sale, the names of the transferees, the
extents involved and the considerations received were set out by the State in
its application for review before the High Court, except for a general denial,
the appellant could not and did not specifically deny the transactions. Same
is the case in this Court, where in the counter- affidavit, the details of
these transactions have been set out by the State and in the rejoinder filed
by the appellant, there is no specific denial of these transactions or of the
extents involved in those transactions. Therefore, it stands established
without an iota of doubt as found by the High Court, that the appellant
suppressed the fact that he had parted with almost the entire property
purchased by him under the registered document through which he claimed title
to the petition schedule property before the Forest Tribunal. In other words,
when he claimed that he had title to 20 acres of land and the same had not
vested in the State and in the alternative, he bona fide intended to cultivate
the land and was cultivating that land, as a matter of fact, he did not have
either title or possession over that land. The Tribunal had found that the
land was a private forest and hence has vested under the Act. The Tribunal had
granted relief to the appellant only based on Section 3(3) of the Act, which
provided that so much extent of private forest held by an owner under a valid
registered document of title executed before the appointed day and intended
for cultivation by him and that does not exceed the extent of the ceiling area
applicable to him under Section 82 of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, could be
exempted. Therefore, unless the appellant had title to the application
schedule land and proved that he intended to cultivate that land himself, he
would not have been entitled to an order under Section 3(3) of the Act. It is
obvious that when he made the claim, the appellant neither had title nor
possession over the land. There could not have been any intention on his part
to cultivate the land with which he had already parted and of which he had no
right to possession. Therefore, the appellant played a fraud on the Court by
holding out that he was the title-holder of the application schedule property
and he intended to cultivate the same, while procuring the order for exclusion
of the application schedule lands. It was not a case of mere perjured
evidence. It was suppression of the most vital fact and the founding of a
claim on a non-existent fact. It was done knowingly and deliberately, with the
intention to deceive. Therefore, the finding of the High Court in the judgment
under appeal that the appellant had procured the earlier order from the Forest
Tribunal by playing a fraud on it, stands clearly established. It was not a
case of the appellant merely putting forward a false claim or obtaining a
judgment based on perjured evidence. This was a case where on a fundamental
fact of entitlement to relief, he had deliberately misled the Court by
suppressing vital information and putting forward a false claim, false to his
knowledge, and a claim which he knew had no basis either in fact or on law. It
is therefore clear that the order of the Forest Tribunal was procured by the
appellant by playing a fraud and the said order is vitiated by fraud. The fact
that the High Court on the earlier occasion declined to interfere either on
the ground of delay in approaching it or on the ground that a second review
was not maintainable, cannot deter a Court moved in that behalf from declaring
the earlier order as vitiated by fraud.
26\. The High Court, as a court of record, has exercised its jurisdiction to
set at naught the order of the Forest Tribunal thus procured by the appellant
by finding that the same is vitiated by fraud. There cannot be any doubt that
the Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 215 of the
Constitution of India has the power to undo a decision that has been obtained
by playing a fraud on the Court. The appellant has invoked our jurisdiction
under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. When we find in agreement with
the High Court that the order secured by him is vitiated by fraud, it is
obvious that this Court should decline to come to his aid by refusing the
exercise of its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the
Constitution of India. We do not think that it is necessary to refer to any
authority in support of this position except to notice the decision in Ashok
Nagar Welfare Assn. v. R.K. Sharma14.
27\. The order of the Forest Tribunal in the case on hand had merged in the
decision in MFA No. 328 of 1981 rendered by the High Court. The governing
decision, therefore, was the decision of the High Court. When seeking to
question the decision as being vitiated by fraud, the proper course to adopt
was to move the court that had rendered the decision, by an application. In a
case where an appeal is possible, an appeal could be filed. The House of Lords
indicated in Kinch v. Walcott2 that it will be in the power of the party to
the decision complaining of fraud to apply directly to the court which
pronounced the judgment to vacate it. The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court
in Guddappa Chikkappa Kurbar v. Balaji Ramji Dange15 observed that: (AIR p.
275) No court will allow itself to be used as an instrument of fraud, and no
court, by the application of rules of evidence or procedure, can allow its
eyes to be closed to the fact that it is being used as an instrument of fraud.
28\. In Hip Foong Hong v. H. Neotia and Co.16 the Privy Council held that if a
judgment is affected by fraudulent conduct it must be set aside. In R. v.
Recorder of Leicester17 it was held that a certiorari would lie to quash a
judgment on the ground that it has been obtained by fraud. The basic principle
obviously is that a party who had secured a judgment by fraud should not be
enabled to enjoy the fruits thereof. In this situation, the High Court in this
case, could have clearly either quashed the decision of the Forest Tribunal in
OA No. 247 of 1979 or could have set aside its own judgment in MFA No. 328 of
1981 dismissing the appeal from the decision of the Forest Tribunal at the
stage of admission and vacated the order of the Forest Tribunal by allowing
that appeal or could have exercised its jurisdiction as a court of record by
invoking Article 215 of the Constitution to set at naught the decision
obtained by the appellant by playing a fraud on the Forest Tribunal. The High
Court has chosen to exercise its power as a court of record to nullify a
decision procured by the appellant by playing a fraud on the Court. We see no
objection to the course adopted by the High Court even assuming that we are
inclined to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of
India at the behest of the appellant.
29\. In the view that we have taken as above, the plea that the second review
was not maintainable, that the Division Bench could not have ignored the
earlier orders of the High Court dismissing the appeal at the stage of
admission and the dismissing of the petition for condonation of delay in
filing the first review, are all of no avail to the appellant. In this case,
the Forest Tribunal had also been moved by way of review and that Tribunal
refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 8-B of the Act and nothing
stands in the way of the High Court setting aside that order on a finding that
the original order from the Forest Tribunal was secured by playing a fraud on
the Tribunal. Equally, nothing stood in the way of the High Court reviewing
the judgment in OP No. 2926 of 1989 in which a mandamus was issued by the High
Court to restore possession of the application schedule property to the
appellant. Similarly, nothing stood in the way of the High Court in allowing
OP No. 20946 of 1997 filed by a body of citizens challenging the restoration
of 20 acres of virgin forest to the appellant in presumed enforcement of the
order in OA No. 247 of 1979 and passing the necessary order nullifying the
original order. The fact that the High Court has chosen to review the earlier
order on the petition for condonation of delay in filing the first review
petition and then to exercise the power of review cannot be of any moment in
the light of what we have stated. In any event, as we have indicated, this is
a fit case where we should clearly decline to exercise our jurisdiction under
Article 136 of the Constitution of India to come to the aid of the appellant
to secure to him the fruits of the fraud practised by him on the Forest
Tribunal and the High Court. Thus, we find no merit in the argument that the
High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in setting aside the order of the
Forest Tribunal at this distance of time.
14.2 In State of A.P. v. T.Suryachandra Rao (2 supra), the Honble Supreme
Court at paragraphs 8 to 16 held as follows
8\. By fraud is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any
expectation of advantage to the party himself or from ill-will towards the
other is immaterial. The expression fraud involves two elements, deceit and
injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss,
that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable, or of money,
and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind,
reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary
loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always cause loss or
detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit
or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the
second condition is satisfied. [See Vimla (Dr.) v. Delhi Admn.1 and Indian
Bank v. Satyam Fibres (India) (P) Ltd.2]
9\. A fraud is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing
something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to
gain by anothers loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (See
S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath3.)
10\. Fraud as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never
dwell together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which includes
the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a
response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is also
well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent
misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief against fraud. A
fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man
into damage by wilfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on
falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he
knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which
the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court
is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive
the rights of others in relation to a property would render the transaction
void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a given case a
deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is anathema to all equitable
principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by
the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata. (See Ram
Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi4.)
11\. Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any
civilised system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human
conduct. Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Miltons sorcerer, Comus, who
exulted in his ability to, wing me into the easy-hearted man and trap him into
snares. It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In Websters Third
New International Dictionary fraud in equity has been defined as an act or
omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains an advantage
against conscience over another or which equity or public policy forbids as
being prejudicial to another. In Blacks Law Dictionary, fraud is defined as an
intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in
reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or
surrender a legal right. A false representation of a matter of fact, whether
by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment
of that which should have been disclosed, which deceives and is intended to
deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise
Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of false
representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick.
According to Halsburys Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have
been false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date
false in substance and in fact. Section 17 of the Contract Act, 1872 defines
fraud as an act committed by a party to a contract with the intent to deceive
another. From dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud arises out of a
deliberate active role of the representator about a fact, which he knows to be
untrue yet he succeeds in misleading the representee by making him believe it
to be true. The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with the
knowledge that it was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry v. Peek5
what constitutes fraud was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) [F]raud is
proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i)
knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless
whether it be true or false. But fraud in public law is not the same as fraud
in private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish fraud in commercial
transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in administrative law. It
has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secy. of State for Home
Deptt.6 that it is dangerous to introduce maxims of common law as to effect of
fraud while determining fraud in relation to statutory law. Fraud in relation
to statute must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a
statute.
If a statute has been passed for some one particular purpose, a court of law
will not countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the operation of
the Act to something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond its
scope. Present-day concept of fraud on statute has veered round abuse of power
or mala fide exercise of power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of
power or defeating the provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the
power may be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations. The colour
of fraud in public law or administrative law, as it is developing, is assuming
different shades. It arises from a deception committed by disclosure of
incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and
procure an order from an authority or tribunal. It must result in exercise of
jurisdiction which otherwise would not have been exercised. That is
misrepresentation must be in relation to the conditions provided in a section
on existence or non- existence of which power can be exercised. But non-
disclosure of a fact not required by a statute to be disclosed may not amount
to fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of every fact does
not vitiate the agreement. In a contract every person must look for himself
and ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain.
In public law the duty is not to deceive. (See Shrisht Dhawan v. Shaw Bros.7
SCC p. 554, para 20.)
12\. In that case it was observed as follows: (SCC p. 553, para 20)
20\. Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any
civilised system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human
conduct. Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Miltons sorcerer, Comus, who
exulted in his ability to, wing me into the easy-hearted man and trap him into
snares. It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In Websters Third
New International Dictionary fraud in equity has been defined as an act or
omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains an advantage
against conscience over another or which equity or public policy forbids as
being prejudicial to another. In Blacks Law Dictionary, fraud is defined as an
intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in
reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or
surrender a legal right; a false representation of a matter of fact whether by
words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of
that which should have been disclosed, which deceives and is intended to
deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise

representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick.
According to Halsburys Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have

false representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in
its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false.
13\. This aspect of the matter has been considered recently by this Court in
Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal8, Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School and
Intermediate Education9, Ram Chandra Singh case4 and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v.
State of T.N.10
14\. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the
court. (See Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust11 and S.P.
Chengalvaraya Naidu case3.
15\. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other
person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to
the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is
not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav
case9.
16\. In Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley12 Lord Denning observed at QB pp. 712
and 713: (All ER p. 345 C) No judgment of a court, no order of a minister, can
be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels
everything. In the same judgment Lord Parker, L.J. observed that fraud
vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of
solemnity.
14.3 In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by L.Rs. v. Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs.
(3 supra), the Honble Supreme Court at paragraphs 1, 7 and 8 held as follows:
1.Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal observed Chief
Justice Edward Coke of England about three centuries ago. It is the settled
proposition of law that a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the
court is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law. Such a judgment/decree by
the first court or by the highest court has to be treated as a nullity by
every court, whether superior or inferior. It can be challenged in any court
even in collateral proceedings.
7\. The High Court, in our view, fell into patent error. The short question
before the High Court was whether in the facts and circumstances of this case,
Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the court. The
High Court, however, went haywire and made observations which are wholly
perverse. We do not agree with the High Court that there is no legal duty cast
upon the plaintiff to come to court with a true case and prove it by true
evidence. The principle of finality of litigation cannot be pressed to the
extent of such an absurdity that it becomes an engine of fraud in the hands of
dishonest litigants. The courts of law are meant for imparting justice between
the parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean hands. We are
constrained to say that more often than not, process of the court is being
abused. Property-grabbers, tax-evaders, bank-loan-dodgers and other
unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the court-process a
convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely. We have no
hesitation to say that a person, whos case is based on falsehood, has no right
to approach the court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the
litigation.
8\. The facts of the present case leave no manner of doubt that Jagannath
obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the court. A fraud is an
act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking
unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by anothers
loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. Jagannath was working as
a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction
on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the
registered release deed (Ex. B-15) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding the
property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal
amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these facts, he
filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that he had
purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar.
Non-production and even non- mentioning of the release deed at the trial is
tantamount to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the
observations of the High Court that the appellants-defendants could have
easily produced the certified registered copy of Ex. B-15 and non-suited the
plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all the
documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he
withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then
he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite
party.
15\. Therefore, a salutary and sacred responsibility is cast upon the Courts
to use the sword of Dharma when a fraud and misrepresentation and distortion
of material realities are brought to the notice of the Court. It is a settled
and a well established principle of law that fraud unravels everything and the
question of limitation pales into insignificance while dealing with the aspect
of suppression of material realities. It is also a settled and well
established proportion of law that the persons, approaching the Courts should
be with clean hands and without concealing and suppressing any material
realities. In the considered opinion of this Court, the petitioners in
W.P.No.11681 of 2000 approached this Court by concealing the material
realities and suppressing the facts which obviously prompted this Court to
pass the order under review. Therefore, the order under review is liable to be
reviewed by this Court in view of the above reasons. In the considered opinion
of this Court these aspects would undoubtedly constitute errors apparent on
the face of record, as such the same obligate this Court to correct the same
under the provisions of Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 114 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.
16\. The very basis for the GHMC to issue the impugned notice in W.P.No.22184
of 2009 is the order under review. Since this Court is of the considered view
that the order under review is liable to be reviewed, the impugned notice in
W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is of no consequence and becomes inoperative. In view of
these orders, this Court is of the view that no orders need be passed in
W.P.M.P.No.3495 of 2013 in W.P.No.22184 of 2009\. In view of the principles
laid down in the above referred judgments, the contention of the learned
senior counsel that the present review is not maintainable in view of the
dismissal of the review filed by the official respondents is not at all
sustainable and tenable and this Court cannot remain as a silent spectator for
the contingencies of this nature.
17\. For the aforesaid reasons and having regard to the principles laid down
by the Honble Supreme Court in the judgments referred to above, the review
petition is allowed and the order passed in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated
13.8.2007 stands reviewed and consequently W.P.No.11681 of 2000 is dismissed
and W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is disposed of subject to the above observations. As
a sequel, the miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed. There shall
be no order as to costs.

16\. The very basis for the GHMC to issue the impugned notice in W.P.No.22184
of 2009 is the order under review. Since this Court is of the considered view
that the order under review is liable to be reviewed, the impugned notice in
W.P.No.22184 of 2009 is of no consequence and becomes inoperative. In view of
these orders, this Court is of the view that no orders need be passed in
W.P.M.P.No.3495 of 2013 in W.P.No.22184 of 2009\. In view of the principles
laid down in the above referred judgments, the contention of the learned
senior counsel that the present review is not maintainable in view of the
dismissal of the review filed by the official respondents is not at all
sustainable and tenable and this Court cannot remain as a silent spectator for
the contingencies of this nature.
17\. For the aforesaid reasons and having regard to the principles laid down
by the Honble Supreme Court in the judgments referred to above, the review
petition is allowed and the order passed in W.P.No.11681 of 2000 dated
13.8.2007 stands reviewed and consequently W.P.No.11681 of 2000 is dismissed
