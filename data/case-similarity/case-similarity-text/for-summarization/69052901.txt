VIBHU BAKHRU, J
1\. These petitions are filed inter alia impugning a common order dated
14.12.2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (hereafter 'CIC')
directing the Public Information Officers, Commissioner of Income- tax
(hereafter 'PIO') to provide inspection of the records and also other
information sought for by the respondent relating to the income tax returns
filed by the petitioners (other than the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.214 of
2010).
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 2 of 29
2\. Brief facts which are relevant for examining the controversy in the
present petitions are that on 13.01.2009, Rakesh Kumar Gupta - respondent, who
is stated to be an informer to the income tax department, filed an application
under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereafter the 'Act') with the PIO
inter alia seeking information and all the records available with the Income
tax department in respect of nine assessees (out of the said assesses one
assessee was deleted due to repetition) for various assessment years. The
respondent had also sought:-
> "1. Inspection of all records in above respect.
> 2\. Kindly provide the copies of the documents mentioned at the time of
> inspection.
> 3\. Kindly provide the officers (from assessing officers to CCIT), who are
> the officers to take action on "Tax Evasion Petition" given by me from
> 1/8/2003 till date.
> Request 4 If you want to treat the above information as third party
> information and want to send the notice to so called third parties inviting
> their objection, then kindly send the complete request to them including all
> the annexure e.g. citing public interest by me due to which information
> should be given to me."
3\. The details sought by the respondent of the eight assessees (hereinafter
collectively referred to as 'assessees') including the details of the
assessment years are as under:-
i) Dr. Naresh Trehan - petitioner in W.P.(C) No.85/2010 pertaining to
Assessment Year 1998-99 to 2005-06 W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected
matters Page 3 of 29
ii) Mr. Rajan Nanda - petitioner in W.P.(C) No.207/2010 pertaining to
Assessment Year 1998-99 to 2005-06
iii) AAA Portfolio Pvt. Ltd. - petitioner in W.P.(C) No.251/2010 pertaining to
Assessment Year 1998-99 to 2005-2006
iv) Big Apple Clothing Pvt. Ltd. - petitioner in W.P.(C) No.251/2010
pertaining to Assessment Year 1998-99 to 2005-06
v) Escorts Ltd. - petitioner in W.P.(C) No.206/2010 pertaining to Assessment
Year 1998-99 to 2005-06.
vi) Escorts Heart Institute & Research Centre Ltd. (Delhi) - petitioner in
W.P.(C) No.202/2010 pertaining to Assessment Year 1998-99 to 2001-02.
vii) Escorts Heart Institute & Research Centre Chandigarh (Society) pertaining
to Assessment Year (2001-2002)
viii) Escorts Heart Institute & Research Centre Limited, Chandigarh pertaining
to Assessment Year 2000-01 to 2005-06.
4\. Since the information sought by the respondent is third party information,
the Deputy Commissioner of Income-tax issued separate notices dated 04.02.2009
under Section 11(2) of the Act to the assessees. The assessees submitted their
separate objections and objected to the inspection and furnishing of the
information. PIO considered the objections of the assessees and rejected the
RTI application of the respondent, by its common order dated 16.02.2009, on
the ground that the respondent has failed to substantiate the public interest
involved in disclosing the W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page
4 of 29 information relating to third parties. PIO, however, held that the Tax
Evasion Petition is under compilation and would be provided in due course.
5\. The respondent preferred separate appeals before the First Appellate
Authority - Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax (hereafter the 'FAA') against the
order of PIO. By a common order dated 08.05.2009, FAA rejected the appeal of
the respondent. Aggrieved by the order dated 08.05.2009 of FAA, the respondent
preferred an appeal before the CIC. By the impugned order dated 14.12.2009,
the CIC allowed the appeal and directed PIO to provide inspection of the
records and also other information sought for by the respondent.
6\. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended:-
6.1 that the information sought for by the respondent such as income tax
returns are personal information and are exempt from disclosure under Section
8(1)(j) of the Act. Reliance was placed on decision of Supreme Court in Girish
Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commr.: (2013) 1 SCC 212, decision
of Full Bench of this Court in Secretary General, Supreme Court of India v.
Subhash Chandra Agarwal & Anr.: 166 (2010) DLT 305 and decision of Full Bench
of the CIC in G R Rawal v. Director General of Income Tax (Investigation):
Appeal No. CIC/AT/A/2007/00490, decided on 05.03.2008.
6.2 that the disclosure of the income tax returns is prohibited under Section
138 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and can be made only if the Commissioner is
satisfied that the disclosure is in public interest, which in the present case
was rejected by the Commissioner. Reference was made to W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &
other connected matters Page 5 of 29 Hanuman Pershadganeriwala v. The Director
of Inspection, Income Tax, New Delhi: (1974) 10 DLT 96.
6.3 that the disclosure of information is also exempted under Section 8(1)(e)
of the Act as the income tax department is holding the information of the
assessees in fiduciary capacity.
6.4 that the respondent has failed to disclose the public interest which is a
mandatory requirement under Section 11 of the Act for disclosure of
confidential and personal third party information.
6.5 that the disclosure of the information sought for would be violative of
the right to privacy, which has been read into Article 21 of the Constitution
of India. Reference was made to paragraph 110 to 112 of the decision of this
court in Secretary General, Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal
& Anr.: 166 (2010) DLT 305.
6.6 that the disclosure of income tax returns is expressly forbidden to be
published by a tribunal, in the present case and the CIC therefore, exempted
under Section 8(1)(b) of the Act.
7\. The respondent contended:-
7.1 that he is an informer with the income tax department and sought the
information in public interest in order to recover the tax evaded by the
petitioners, to recover the properties mis-appropriated by the petitioners and
to curb corruption and therefore, the exemptions provided under Section
8(1)(e) and (j) of the Act are not applicable.
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 6 of 29
7.2 that the bank details and tax details should be given to public, where
prima facie wrong doing is detected by the government. Reliance was placed on
Ram Jethmalani & Ors. v. Union of India: (2011) 8 SCC 1.
7.3 that the activities performed by the income tax department are public in
nature and the income tax records are public documents. Reliance was placed on
Bhagat Singh v. Chief Information Commissioner and Ors.: 146 (2008) DLT 385.
7.4 that the disclosure of information under Section 3 of the Act is the rule
and exemption under Section 8 of the Act is the exception.
8\. The controversy that needs to be addressed is whether income tax returns
and the information provided to the income tax authorities during the course
of assessment and proceedings thereafter, are exempt under the provision
Section 8(1) of the Act and further whether in the given circumstances of this
case, the CIC was correct in holding that such information was required to be
disclosed in public interest.
9\. By virtue of Section 3 of the Act all citizens have a right to information
subject to provisions of the Act. The expression "information" is defined
under Section 2(f) of the Act as under:-
> "2(f) "information" means any material in any form, including records,
> documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars,
> orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material
> held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body
> which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time
> being in force;"
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 7 of 29
> (emphasis provided)
> 10\. It is also relevant to note that by virtue of Section 22 of the Act,
> the provisions of the Act have an overriding effect over any other
> inconsistent law or instrument.
11\. The petitioners have contended that the income tax returns and other
information provided by the assessees during the course of assessment would be
exempt from disclosure by virtue of section 8(1)(d), Section 8(1)(e) and
8(1)(j) of the Act. It is thus necessary to examine the applicability of each
of the above provisions with respect to the information sought by the
respondent.
12\. Section 8(1)(d) of the Act expressly provides an exemption in respect of
such information. At this stage, it is necessary to refer to Section 8(1)(d)
of the Act which reads as under:-
> "8. Exemption from disclosure of information.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything
> contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,--
> xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
> (d) information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or
> intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive
> position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that
> larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;
13\. Certain petitioners had specifically pleaded that information provided in
the income tax returns could not be disclosed as the information was provided
in confidence. The CIC rejected the same by holding that the parties had
failed to explain as to how that ground could apply or how W.P.(C) Nos.
85/2010 & other connected matters Page 8 of 29 disclosure of information
relating to commercial confidence would harm their competitive interest.
14\. The income tax returns filed by an assessee and further information that
is provided during the assessment proceedings may also include confidential
information relating to the business or the affairs of an assessee. An
assessee is expected to truly and fairly disclose particulars relevant for the
purposes of assessment of income tax. The nature of the disclosure required is
not limited only to information that has been placed by an assessee in public
domain but would also include information which an assessee may consider
confidential. As a matter of illustration, one may consider a case of a
manufacturer who manufactures and deals in multiple products for supplies to
different agencies. In the normal course, an Assessing Officer would require
an assessee to disclose profit margins on sales of such products. Such
information would clearly disclose the pricing policy of the assessee and
public disclosure of this information may clearly jeopardise the bargaining
power available to the assessee since the data as to costs would be available
to all agencies dealing with the assessee. It is, thus, essential that
information relating to business affairs, which is considered to be
confidential by an assessee must remain so, unless it is necessary in larger
public interest to disclose the same. If the nature of information is such
that disclosure of which may have the propensity of harming one's competitive
interests, it would not be necessary to specifically show as to how disclosure
of such information would, in fact, harm the competitive interest of a third
party. In order to test the applicability of Section 8(1)(d) of the Act it is
necessary to first and W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 9
of 29 foremost determine the nature of information and if the nature of
information is confidential information relating to the affairs of a private
entity that is not obliged to be placed in public domain, then it is necessary
to consider whether its disclosure can possibly have an adverse effect on
third parties.
15\. Insofar as the applicability of Section 8(1)(e) of the Act is concerned,
I am unable to accept the contention that a fiduciary relationship within the
meaning of Section 8(1)(e) of the Act can be attributed to a relationship
between an assessee and the income tax authority. The Supreme Court in the
case of CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay: (2011) 8 SCC 497 had explained that the
words "information available to a person in its fiduciary relationship" could
not be construed in a wide sense but has to be considered in the normal and
recognized sense. The relevant extract of the said decision is quoted below:-
> "41. In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies can be said to
> act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to the students who participate
> in an examination, as a Government does while governing its citizens or as
> the present generation does with reference to the future generation while
> preserving the environment. But the words "information available to a person
> in his fiduciary relationship" are used in Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act in
> its normal and well-recognised sense, that is, to refer to persons who act
> in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or
> beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the
> actions of the fiduciary--a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the
> trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically infirm/mentally
> challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered
> accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a
> patient, an agent with W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page
> 10 of 29 reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another
> partner, a Director of a company with reference to a shareholder, an
> executor with reference to a legatee, a Receiver with reference to the
> parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information
> relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business
> dealings/transaction of the employer. We do not find that kind of fiduciary
> relationship between the examining body and the examinee, with reference to
> the evaluated answer books, that come into the custody of the examining
> body."
16\. The information provided by an assessee in its income tax return is in
compliance of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and thus, could not
be stated to be information provided in course of a fiduciary relationship.
17\. Four of the petitioners (Dr Naresh Trehan, Escorts Heart Institute and
Research Center, Delhi, Escorts Heard Institute and Research Center,
Chandigarh and Escorts Heart Institute and Research Center Ltd.) had further
contended that information sought by the respondent was exempt under Section
8(1)(j) of the Act. Section 8(1)(j) of the Act exempts information which
relates to personal information. The said clause is quoted below for ready
reference:-
> "8. Exemption from disclosure of information.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything
> contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,--
> xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
> (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of
> which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which
> would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the
> Central W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 11 of 29 Public
> Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate
> authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest
> justifies the disclosure of such information:"
18\. The question whether the information provided by an individual in his
income tax returns is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act
is no longer res integra in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in
Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commr.: (2013) 1 SCC 212.
The relevant extract of the said judgment is quoted below:
> "11. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show-cause
> notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his
> employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and also the
> details of his investments, lending and borrowing from banks and other
> financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts
> stated to have been accepted by the third respondent, his family members and
> friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly
> sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third respondent.
> The question that has come up for consideration is: whether the
> abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be "personal information"
> as defined in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act.
> 12\. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the details
> called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to the third
> respondent, show-cause notices and orders of censure/punishment, etc. are
> qualified to be personal information as defined in clause (j) of Section
> 8(1) of the RTI Act. The performance of an employee/officer in an
> organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and
> normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under
> the expression "personal information", the disclosure of which has no
> relationship to any public activity or W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other
> connected matters Page 12 of 29 public interest. On the other hand, the
> disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that
> individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information
> Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority
> is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of

> cannot claim those details as a matter of right.
> 13\. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are
> "personal information" which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j)
> of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and
> the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information
> Officer or the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public
> interest justifies the disclosure of such information.
> 14\. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide public
> interest in seeking information, the disclosure of such information would
> cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual under Section
> 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act."
19\. The CIC rejected the aforesaid contention by holding that the expression
"personal information" would necessarily only apply to an individual and could
not be applicable in case of corporate entities.
20\. It has been contended by the petitioners that the expression "personal
information" must also extend to information relating to corporate entities.
Inasmuch as they may also fall within the definition of expression "person"
under the General Clauses Act, 1897 as well as under the Income Tax Act,
1961\. However, I am unable to accept this contention for the reason that the
expression "personal information" as used in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the
Act has to be read in the context of information relating to an individual. A
plain reading of the aforesaid clause would indicate that the W.P.(C) Nos.
85/2010 & other connected matters Page 13 of 29 expression "personal
information" is linked with "invasion of privacy of the individual". The use
of the word "the" before the word "individual" immediately links the same with
the expression "personal information"
21\. Black's law dictionary, sixth edition, inter alia, defines the word
"personal" as under:-
> "The word "personal" means appertaining to the person; belonging to an
> individual; limited to the person; having the nature or partaking of the
> qualities of human beings, or of movable property."
22\. A perusal of the above definition also indicates that the ordinary usage
of the word "personal" is in the context of an individual human being and not
a corporate entity. The U.S. Supreme Court has also interpreted the expression
"personal" to be used in the context of an individual human being and not a
corporate entity. In the case of Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T
Inc: 2011 US LEXIS 1899 the US Supreme Court considered the meaning of the
expression "personal privacy" in the context of the Freedom of Information
Act, which required Federal Agencies to make certain records and documents
publically available on request. Such disclosure was exempt if the records
"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy". The U.S. Supreme Court held that the expression "Personal"
used in the aforesaid context could not be extended to corporations because
the word "personal" ordinarily refers to individuals. The Court held that the
expression "personal" must be given its ordinary meaning. The relevant extract
of the said judgment is as under:
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 14 of 29
> ""Person" is a defined term in the statute; "personal" is not. When a
> statute does not define a term, we typically "give the phrase its ordinary
> meaning." Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 559 U.S. 133, 130 S.
> Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1, 8 (2010). "Personal" ordinarily refers to
> individuals. We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal

W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 15 of 29
23\. In my view, the aforesaid reasoning would also be applicable to the
expression "personal" used in Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The expression
'individual' must be construed in an expansive sense and would include a body
of individuals. The said exemption would be available even to unincorporated
entities as also private, closely held undertaking which are in substance
alter egos of their shareholders. However, the expression individual cannot be
used as a synonym for the expression 'person'. Under the General Clauses Act,
1897 a person is defined to "include any company or association or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not". Thus, whereas a person would
include an individual as well as incorporated entities and artificial persons,
the expression 'individual' cannot be interpreted to include such entities.
The context in which, the expression "personal information" is used would also
exclude it application to large widely held corporations. While, confidential
information of a corporation is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(d)
of the Act, there is no scope to exclude other information relating to such
corporations under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act as the concept of a personal
information cannot in ordinary language be understood to mean information
pertaining to a public corporation.
24\. It would also be relevant to refer to the decision of a Division Bench of
this Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Goel v. Public Information Officer Vat
Ward No. 64 & Anr.: (2012) 188 DLT 597 whereby it was held that information of
the returns made to the Sales Tax Commissioner in relation to a firm was
exempt under Section 8(1) of the Act. The relevant portion of the said
judgment is quoted as under:-
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 16 of 29
> "7. It is not in dispute that the information in the form of returns filed
> by the respondent No. 2's firm is in the nature of commercial confidence
> which is clearly inferable from Section 98 of the Act. Such information can
> be given only if larger public interest warrants the disclosure of this
> information. All the authorities below including the learned Single Judge
> has held and rightly so that no public interest is at all involved in
> seeking of this information by the appellant from the Sales Tax
> Commissioner. What to talk of public interest, the finding is that the
> information is sought with oblique motive to settle personal scores."
25\. Indisputably, Section 8(1)(j) of the Act would be applicable to the
information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in W.P.(C) 88/2010) and
the information contained in the income tax returns would be personal
information under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. However, the CIC directed
disclosure of information of Dr Trehan also by concluding that income tax
returns and information provided for assessment was in relation to a "public
activity." In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of
filing returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity. The
expression "public activity" would mean activities of a public nature and not
necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The expression "public
activity" would denote activity done for the public and/or in some manner
available for participation by public or some section of public. There is no
public activity involved in filing a return or an individual pursuing his
assessment with the income tax authorities. In this view, the information
relating to individual assesse could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held
that the same was justified "in the larger public interest"
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 17 of 29
26\. At this stage, it may be appropriate to consider the nature of
information that is provided by an assesse to its Assessing Officer. In case
of Income from business and profession, the income tax returns mainly disclose
the final accounts (i.e. profit and loss account and balance sheets) This
information is otherwise also liable to be disclosed by companies and is
available in public domain since it is necessary for a company to file its
annual accounts with the Registrar of Companies. Other incorporated entities
are similarly required to also publically disclose their final accounts.
However, an Assessing Officer may call for further information while
determining the assessable income, which may include all books and papers
maintained by an entity. Such information may also have information relating
to other parties, the disclosure of which may be exempt under Section 8(1) of
the Act. As a matter of illustration, the books of accounts would record
transactions of commercial nature which may enjoin the parties to the
transactions to keep the information confidential. Further, the books of
accounts would also record salaries and other payments to other individuals.
Disclosure of such information would affect not just the assessee but also
other parties. In the circumstances, it would be necessary to examine the
details of information that are sought from the public authority. In the
present case, the respondent seems to have sought for an omnibus disclosure of
all records and returns. In my view, the same could not be allowed without
examining the nature of information contained therein.
27\. The Supreme Court in the case of Thalappalam Ser. Coop. Bank Ltd. and
others v. State of Kerala and others: Civil Appeal No. 9017 of 2013, W.P.(C)
Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 18 of 29 decided on 07.10.2013.
considered the question whether a society registered would fall within the
definition of a public authority under Section 2(h) of the Act. The Court also
clearly stated that the information supplied by a society to the Registrar of
Societies could be disclosed except for the information that was exempt under
Section 8(1) of the Act and that included accounts maintained by members of
society. The relevant passage from the said judgment is quoted below:-
> "52. Registrar of Cooperative Societies functioning under the Cooperative
> Societies Act is a public authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of
> the Act. As a public authority, Registrar of Co-operative Societies has been
> conferred with lot of statutory powers under the respective Act under which

> under the RTI Act and furnish information to a citizen under the RTI Act.
> Information which he is expected to provide is the information enumerated in

> writing."
28\. It is apparent that information submitted by an assessee in the course of
assessment, may also include information relating to other persons. The
exclusions available under Section 8(1) of the Act, would also be available in
respect of that information.
29\. Section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided that the information
furnished by an assessee was confidential and was not liable to be disclosed.
Section 137 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was deleted by the Finance Act, 1964
and simultaneously, Section 138 the Income Tax Act, 1961 was substituted.
Section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is quoted below:-
> "138. Disclosure of information respecting assessees.- (1)(a) The Board or
> any other income-tax authority specified by it by a general or special order
> in this behalf may furnish or cause to be furnished to-
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 20 of 29
> (i) any officer, authority or body performing any functions under any law
> relating to the imposition of any tax, duty or cess, or to dealings in
> foreign exchange as defined in clause (n) of section 2 of the Foreign
> Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999); or
> (ii) such officer, authority or body performing functions under any other

> opinion of the Board or other income-tax authority, be necessary for the

> (b) Where a person makes an application to the Chief Commissioner or

> may be specified in the order."
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 21 of 29
30\. In the case of Hanuman Pershad (supra), this Court considered the
question whether there was any bar on the Income Tax Department from
disclosing records produced during the assessment proceedings. The said
controversy was answered by the following words:-
> "It is undoubtedly open to the authorities to disclose information received
> by them from assessments or other proceedings under the Act. However, there
> are restrictions contained in Section 138 as now existing concerning the
> manner in which that information is to be disclosed. Leaving aside sub-
> clause (a) of sub-section (1) it seems that under sub- clause (b), the
> Commissioner can disclose information if he is satisfied that it is within
> the public interest to do so. Hence, if some other authority applies to the
> Commissioner to obtain information, the same may be disclosed in the
> discretion of the Commissioner. Under Sub-clause (a) there is also a power
> to furnish information to other authorities. As this matter has not been
> fully argued or discussed in the present case, it is sufficient to note that
> there is no power to disclose information to other authorities and officers
> outside the provisions of the Section. As far as the information already
> given is concerned, we have no power to give any direction concerning the
> same."
31\. Although by virtue of Section 22 of the Act, the provisions of the Act
have an overriding effect over any other inconsistent law, the said provisions
of the Act insofar as they are not inconsistent with other statutes must be
read harmoniously. Undoubtedly, the income tax returns and information
provided to Income Tax Authorities by assessees is confidential and not
required to be placed in public domain. Given the nature of the income tax
returns and the information necessary to support the same, it would be exempt
under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act in respect of individual and unincorporated
assessees. The information as disclosed in W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other
connected matters Page 22 of 29 the income tax returns would qualify as
personal information with regard to several private companies which are,
essentially, alter egos of their promoters. However, in cases of widely held
companies most information relating to their income and expenditure would be
in public domain and the confidential information would be exempt from
disclosure under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act. Further, even in cases of
corporate entities, the income tax returns and other disclosure made to
authorities would also include transactions with other parties and those
parties can also claim the exception under Section 8(1) of the Act. One has to
also bear in mind that an authority may not have any obligation to provide any
information other than in the form in which it is available and the
information provided by an assessee may not have been edited to remove
references to other persons. Keeping all the aforesaid considerations in view,
the parliament has enacted Section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide
for disclosure only where it is necessary in public interest. Similar
provisions are enacted under the Act and clauses (d), (e) and (j) of Section
8(1) of the Act that specify that information exempt from disclosure under
those clauses, could be disclosed in larger public interest. Section 8(2) of
the Act also provides for a non obstante clause which permits disclosure of
information in larger public interest.
32\. It would also be necessary to refer to Section 11 of the Act, which
provides for a notice to a third party before any third party information is
disclosed. The proviso to Section 11 of the Act also specifies that disclosure
of trade or commercial secrets, which are protected by law W.P.(C) Nos.
85/2010 & other connected matters Page 23 of 29 would not be allowed unless
their disclosure is necessary in public interest. Section 11(1) of the Act
reads as under:-
> "11. Third party information.--(1) Where a Central Public Information
> Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends
> to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made
> under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and
> has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public
> Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be,
> shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written
> notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central
> Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case
> may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and
> invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding
> whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the
> third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure
> of information:
> Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by
> law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure
> outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such
> third party."
33\. In the above context where the nature of income tax returns and other
information provided for assessment of income is confidential and its
disclosure is protected under the Income Tax Act, 1961 it is not necessary to
read any inconsistency between the Act and Income Tax Act, 1961. And,
information furnished by an assesse can be disclosed only where it is
necessary to do in public interest and where such interest outweighs in
importance, any possible harm or injury to the assesse or any other third
party. However, information furnished by corporate assessees that neither
W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected matters Page 24 of 29 relates to
another party nor is exempt under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act, can be
disclosed.
34\. In view of the aforesaid, the principal question that is to be addressed
is whether the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that disclosure of
income tax returns and other information relating to assessment of income of
the petitioners was in public interest.
35\. In order to address this controversy, it is important to understand the
purpose of the respondent in seeking such information. The proceedings under
the Income Tax Act, 1961 with respect to assessment of income are at different
stages. It is stated that in some cases, assessment is complete and appeal
proceedings are pending in other fora. In one case, it is contended that the
Appellate Authorities have remanded the matter of assessment to the Assessing
Officer. It is apparent that the assessment proceedings have thrown up
contentious issues which are being agitated between the income tax authorities
and the assessees. The respondent, essentially, wants to intervene in those
proceedings by adding and providing his contentions or interpretation as to
the information provided by the asseesees or otherwise available with the
Income Tax Authorities.
36\. In my view, the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that this was in
larger public interest. The CIC arrived at this conclusion by noting that
disclosure of information was in larger public interest in increasing public
revenue and reducing corruption. The assessment proceedings are not public
proceedings where all and sundry are allowed to participate and add their
opinion to the proceedings. Merely because a spirited citizen W.P.(C) Nos.
85/2010 & other connected matters Page 25 of 29 wishes to assist in assessment
proceedings, the same cannot be stated to be in larger public interest. On the
contrary, larger public interest would require that assessment proceedings are
completed expeditiously and by the authorities who are statutorily empowered
to do so.
37\. In the present case, there was no material to indicate that there was any
corruption on the part of the income tax authorities which led to a
justifiable apprehension that the said authorities were not performing their
function diligently. In any event, the CIC has not found that the proceedings
relating to assessment were not being conducted in accordance with law and/or
required the intervention of the respondent. Assessment proceedings are quasi-
judicial proceedings where assessee has to produce material to substantiate
their return of income. Income tax has to be assessed by the income tax
authorities strictly in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961 and based on
the information sought by them. In the present case, the respondent wants to
process the information to assist and support the role of an Assessing
Officer. This has a propensity of interfering in the assessment proceedings
and thus, cannot be considered to be in larger public interest. The CIC had
proceeded on the basis that the income tax authorities should disclose
information to informers of income tax departments to enable them to bring
instances of tax evasion to the notice of income tax authorities. In my view,
this reasoning is flawed as it would tend to subvert the assessment process
rather than aid it. If this idea is carried to its logical end, it would
enable several busy bodies to interfere in assessment proceedings and throw up
their interpretation of law and facts as to how an assessment ought to be
carried out. The propensity of this to W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 & other connected
matters Page 26 of 29 multiply litigation cannot be underestimated. Further,
the proposition that unrelated parties could intervene in assessment
proceedings is wholly alien to the Income Tax Act, 1961. The income tax
returns and information are provided in aid of the proceedings that are
conducted under that Act and there is no scope for enhancing or providing for
an additional dimension to the assessment proceedings.
38\. The Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain
Abbas Rizwi: (2012) 13 SCC 61 held that the statutory exemption provided under
Section 8 of the Act is the rule and only in exceptional circumstances of
larger public interest the information would be disclosed. It was also held
that 'public purpose' needs to be interpreted in the strict sense and public
interest has to be construed keeping in mind the balance between right to
privacy and right to information. The relevant extract from the said judgment
is quoted below:
> "21. ...... Another very significant provision of the Act is Section
> 8(1)(j). In terms of this provision, information which relates to personal
> information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public
> activity or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the

39\. Applying the aforesaid judgment to the facts of this case, it is apparent
that disclosure of information as directed has no discernable element of
larger public interest.
40\. Accordingly, the petitions are allowed and the impugned order is set
aside. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
