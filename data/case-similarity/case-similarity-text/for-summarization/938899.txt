gardeners, night watchman and sweepers provided by the employer should be
calculated on an ad hoc basis as given in Letter No. 40 25 69, dated 8- 6-
1971 (reproduced below) only when the services of sweeper are provided by the
employer, i. e. the sweeper is recruited by the employer and remunerated by
him but his services are placed at the disposal of the employee. 2 Rent- free
accommodation.- While determining the fair rental value of an accommodation
owned by the company, the cost of acquisition and other capital expenses on
renovation, etc. incurred by the company should be taken into account. In
respect of premises taken on lease or rent by the company the actual payment
by the company should be taken as fair rental value of the premises. 3
Reimbursement of medical expenses.- The value of the perquisite arising by way
of payment or reimbursement by an employer of expenditure on medical treatment
incurred by his employee on himself or on his spouse, children or parents
including the provision of free medical treatment or treatment at a
concessional rate will not be included in the taxable salary of the employee
in the following cases:
(i) where the medical treatment is availed at hospitals, clinics, etc.
maintained by the employer;
(ii) where the medical treatment is availed at hospitals maintained by the
Government or local authorities or hospitals approved for the purposes of CGHS
or the Central Medical Scheme;
(iii) where the expenditure is on medical insurance premia;
(iv) where the medical treatment is availed of from any doctor outside the
institutions schemes mentioned above, an expenditure of upto Rs. 10, 000 in a
year in the aggregate; and
(v) where the medical treatment is availed of in a hospital outside India and
the expenditure is incurred for treatment including on travel and stay abroad
in connection with such treatment, as also on travel and stay abroad of one
attendant, to the extent permitted by RBI subject to the condition that the
amount qualifying for such tax exemption would not include expenditure
incurred on travel in the case of employees whose gross total income as
computed without considering the amount paid or reimbursed for expenditure in
connection with medical treatment exceeds Rs. 1 lakh. 4 Rent- free residential
accommodation.- Keeping in view the steep escalation in rents, it has been
decided that in the case of rent- free accommodation provided by an employer
to an employee at Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras, the perquisite value
will be calculated by adding the excess over 60 per cent of the salary of the
employee. The valuation in regard to other places in India would be with
reference to the excess over 50 per cent. In the case of rent- free furnished
accommodation and addition in respect of the perquisite by way of furniture at
10 per cent per annum of the original cost of such furniture is to be made.
Perquisite value of free furniture, including television sets, radio sets,
refrigerators, other household appliances and air- conditioning plant and
equipment provided to all categories of salaried taxpayers will be taken to be
15 per cent of the original cost of such furniture or where the furniture is
hired, the hire charges payable by the employer. In the case of person,,,
employed by the RBI, statutory corporations, government companies, bodies or
undertakings financed wholly or mainly by the government and officers of
government whose services have been lent to or who are employed after
retirement from Government service with any company in
which not less than 40 per cent of the shares are held by the Government of
RBI or a corporation owned by RBI, the perquisite value of unfurnished rent-
free residential accommodation will be taken to be 10 per cent of the salary
due to the person in respect of the period during which the accommodation was
occupied by him. If residential accommodation is provided by the employer at a
concessional rent the value of the perquisite will be determined as if the
employee had been provided with rent- free residential accommodation and the
amount so computed will be reduced by the rent payable by the employee. 5
Motor car conveyance.- If a motor car is provided by the employer for the use
by the employee partly for his private or personal purpose and partly for use
in the performance of his duties, a proportionate part of the expenditure
incurred by the employer on the running and maintenance of the motor car and
of the amount representing normal wear and tear of the motor car, which is
attributable to the user of the car by the employee for his private or
personal purposes the duties of employment are to be performed or from back to
his residence will be regarded as use motor car for private or personal
purposes will be taken as the value of the perquisite in the hands of the
employee. Where the employee is provided with or allowed the use of motor car
for his private or personal purposes at a concessional rate, the value of the
perquisite will first be computed as if the perquisite had been provided by
the employer free of charge and the amount so computed will be reduced by the
amount payable by the employee to the employer. 6 Payments to servants.- The
amount spent on the salary of a gardener by the employer does not represent a
sum paid by the employer in respect of any obligation which but for such
payment would have been payable by the employee. The payment of salary to a
gardener as such cannot be regarded as a perquisite so as to justify that
amount being taxed in the hands of' the employees. However, the expenses
incurred by way of maintenance of a gardener may be taken into account for the
purposes of estimating the value of rent- free residential accommodation
provided by the employer under rule 3. The taxable perquisite in the hands of
the employee on account of services of servants provided by the employer will
be calculated at 75 per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per month whichever is
less in the case of sweeper and 50 per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per
month whichever is less in the case of gardeners and watchman. 7 Sumptuary
allowance.- Sumptuary allowance has to be treated as an entertainment
allowance. Accordingly such allowance received by a person who is in receipt
of salary from Government to the extent that such allowance is required to be
deducted in computing the income chargeable under the head' salaries' may be
regarded as an allowance exempt and may not be included in the term' salary'
for the purposes of rule 3. 8 Children' s education allowance.- Payments
towards children' s education made to the employee or on behalf of the
employee will be liable to income- tax (i) where fixed allowances are given in
cash by the employer to the employee to meet the cost of education of the
latter' s children; (ii) where the education fees are paid by the employer
directly to the school; and (iii) where the employee incurs the expenses in
the first instance and gets reimbursement from the employer. 9 Premium for
annuity.- The premium paid by an ex- employer to purchase an annuity payable
to an ex- employee is taxable only under section 17 (3) (ii). The payment will
not be admissible as revenue expenditure in the hands of the employer.
