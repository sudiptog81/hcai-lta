46\. As we have decided these appeals on the primary issue of benefit itself,
holding that there was no benefit arising to the appellant-companies in the
preferential allotment of shares of DRL, it is found not necessary further to
decide on the other circumstances necessary to attract the provisions of
section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Therefore, the remaining grounds
are not considered as it would be academic in nature.

3\. Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. is a company in which the appellant-companies
have substantial investments as shares in the capital. The said company had
made a preferential allotment of equity shares to the appellant-companies in
the previous year relevant to the assessment year under appeal. M/s. KNB
Investments (P) Ltd. was allotted 9,00,000 shares and M/s. KAR Investments (P)
Ltd. was allotted 8,13,900 shares. The preferential allotment was made at Rs.
90 per share while the market price was Rs. 455 per share. The assessing
officer treated the differential price of Rs. 365 per share as benefits
arising from business in the hands of the appellant-companies, and brought the
same to tax holding it as income under section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act,
1961. The disputed additions have been made on this ground.

4\. In both the cases in appeal before us, the issue is the same, that the
addition of income made under section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act under the
same set of facts and circumstances. Accordingly, both the appeals are
considered together for analogous disposal. The only issue to be considered in
these appeals is whether the Income Tax Department is right in holding that
the differential price availed by the appellant-companies in acquiring the
equity shares in the capital of DRL Ltd., through a preferential allotment, is
income of the appellant companies within the meaning of section 28(iv) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 as "benefit arising from business".

8\. The acquisition of shares through the above preferential allotment has
been reflected in the balance-sheets of the two appellant-companies as on
31-3-1995 as investments in the shares of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. We are
concerned with the assessment year 1995-96 for which the relevant previous
year is 1994-95. While examining the accounts of the appellant-companies in
the course of assessments under section 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961,
the acquisition of shares on preferential allotment caught the special
attention of the assessing officer. She found that the shares of Dr. Reddys
Laboratories Ltd. were quoted in Hyderabad Stock Exchange at Rs. 455 per share
at the time of share applications made by the appellant-companies, whereas the
preferential allotment of shares were made to the appellant-companies at Rs.
90 per share. She found that there is a difference of Rs. 365 between the
quoted market price and preferential allotment price of a share. On a detailed
examination of the facts and circumstances of the case, she came to a finding
that the appellant-companies have derived benefits of Rs. 365 per share in the
deal of preferential allotment; and that those benefits arose from business
carried on by the companies. As the benefits have arisen from the business
carried on by the appellant-companies, the assessing officer held that the
value of that benefit has to be treated as income liable to tax under section
28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
8\. The acquisition of shares through the above preferential allotment has
been reflected in the balance-sheets of the two appellant-companies as on
31-3-1995 as investments in the shares of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. We are
concerned with the assessment year 1995-96 for which the relevant previous
year is 1994-95. While examining the accounts of the appellant-companies in

carried on by the appellant-companies, the assessing officer held that the
value of that benefit has to be treated as income liable to tax under section

9\. The differential price per share was Rs. 365. M/s. KNB Investments (P)
Ltd. has acquired 9,00,000 shares. Therefore, the total value of the benefits
would be Rs. 32,85,00,000. Likewise M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd. has acquired
8,13,900 shares and the benefits would be of Rs. 29,70,73,500. Accordingly,
the assessing officer proposed an addition of income of Rs. 32,85,00,000 in
the assessment of M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd. and Rs. 29,70,73,500 in the
assessment of M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd.

10\. The appellant-companies filed detailed objections to the propositions
made by the assessing officer through their letter dated 12-3-1998. The
objections run as follows
10\. The appellant-companies filed detailed objections to the propositions
made by the assessing officer through their letter dated 12-3-1998. The
objections run as follows
1\. The special resolution authorising preferential allotment of shares was
passed on 16-3-1994 which fell in the previous year 1993-94 and therefore, the
issue has to be considered for the assessment year 1994-95 rather than
proposed for the assessment year 1995-96. Reliance placed on Abbot v. Philbin
(Inspector of Taxes) (1962) 44 ITR 144 (HL).
2\. What would be chargeable to tax under section 28 would be an income, i.e.
receipt on revenue account. The issue of equity shares on preferential basis
to the promoters would be on capital account and not on revenue account and as
such it cannot be brought to tax under section 28 of the Income Tax Act.
3\. The provisions of section 28(iv) provide that the benefit must be arising
from business so as to treat its value as income. In the appellants cases,
they neither carried on any business nor received any benefit.
4\. The words arising from business implies that any receipt from trade or
from an adventure in the nature of trade should be regarded as income and
assessable to tax is explained by the Patna High Court in Bisheshwar Singh v.
CIT (1955) 27 ITR 376. In the case of appellants no business was carried on by
them and the income considered of dividend and interest from investments to be
assessed under Income from other sources.
5\. There is no nexus between the business of the appellants and the benefits
derived by them, so that the benefits do not become income. Reliance placed on
CIT v. Bhavnagar Bone & Fertiliser Co. Ltd. (1987) 166 ITR 316 (Guj) and CIT
v. General Electrodes & Equipments Ltd. (1985) 155 ITR 78 (Bom).
6\. The profit on acquisition of shares made not for the purposes of dealing
in them, would be on capital account and therefore, could not be treated as
income. Reliance placed on Ramnarain Sons (P) Ltd. v. CIT (1961) 41 ITR 534
(SC), Kishan Prasad & Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1955) 27 ITR 49 (SC) and CIT v.
National Finance Ltd. (1962) 44 ITR 788 (SC).
7\. Every benefit is not taxable. Mere relief in expenses is not income. The
reduction in the capital cost cannot be treated as income. Reliance placed on
Acharya D.V. Pande v. CIT (1965) 56 ITR 152 (Guj).
8\. If the proposition of the assessing officer is to be accepted then the
benefits arising to shareholders and directors in the Rights issue of shares
by a company would be treated as income and brought to tax which is against
the legislative intention discussed in Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular
No. 710, dated 24-7-1995.
11\. The assessing officer considered all the above objections in detail, but
declined to accept them for the following reasons :
11\. The assessing officer considered all the above objections in detail, but
declined to accept them for the following reasons :
1\. In Abbots case (supra) cited by the appellants, it was held that the tax-
payer should be assessed in respect of the year when the option to purchase
shares was given. In the present case, in pursuance to their resolution dated
16-3-1994, Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. made the offer to exercise the option
on 25-4-1994 as evident from the copy of share application marked as Annexure
G to the assessment order. The Companies made the applications on 17-5-1994
and 9-5-1994. Shares were allotted on 10-5-1994. All the events have taken
place in the financial year 1994-95 which is the previous year relevant to the
assessment year 1995-96. Therefore, the issue of taxability has been rightly
considered for the assessment year 1995-96.
2\. The benefits have been derived by the appellant-companies in the course of
their business of investment. It is revenue in nature and therefore, taxable.
The same items may be capital asset in one hand and the receipt of the same
may be on revenue account in the other hand. It was held that shares allotted
to a director of a company pursuant to agreement between promoters is a
benefit assessable to taxD.M. Neterwalla v. CIT (1980) 122 ITR 880 (Bom).
Reliance also placed on Amarendra Nath Chakraborty v. CIT (1971) 79 ITR 342
(Cal), wherein it was held that the value of the gift of land was a receipt by
the assessee in carrying on of his vocation and was as such taxable in his
hands.
3\. The differential price has resulted in benefits to the appellant-
companies. According to Oxford Dictionary, benefit includes favourable or
helpful factor or circumstances or gain or any advantage. According to
Strounds Judicial Dictionary, benefit is something much more than advancement.
Within the above meaning the advantage availed by the appellant companies was
in the nature of benefits. The benefit in this case is analogous to the
perquisites mentioned in section 17(2)(iii) of the Income Tax Act as explained
in Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular No. 710, dated 24-7-1995. Appellant
companies cannot compare the impugned preferential allotment of shares to
rights issue. In a rights issue all the shareholders are given the option to
subscribe to such issue. In the present case, the option was made available
only to promoters group. The appellant companies would be getting higher
dividends while holding the shares and would be earning higher profits while
disposing the shares without commensurate investments when compared to others.
4\. In all the returns filed by the appellant-companies for the earlier years,
the income of dividend and interest were declared under the head Profits and
gains of business or profession. They have been consistently showing NIL
income from other sources. Against the Dividends and interest income credited
in the Profit and Loss Account, the appellant companies have been debiting all
their expenses of business. The loss determined in the assessments has been
claimed for the benefit of carry forward and set off. Auditors report dated
23-12-1994 in para 3 sub-para (ix) observes that the companies have been
dealing in shares. In the letter dated 6-10-1997, it has been stated that the
principal business of the assessee-company is to deal in shares and securities
of listed companies mainly in the nature of investment activity. Therefore,
the contention by the appellant-companies that their only income is from other
sources and not from business is clearly unfounded.
5\. The main objects of the appellant-companies as set out in their Memorandum
of Association are to carry on the business of investment, to acquire stocks
and shares and to deal in them. The main activities carried on are doing
investments in group companies as promoters. In all the returns filed so far,
the business has been declared as investment in companies. This is supported
by the Auditors report from time to time. In their order, the Andhra Pradesh
High Court has observed while approving the scheme of amalgamation in C.P. No.
01/95, that the appellant-companies were engaged in the business of investment
in securities and shares and finances. In his statement made on 6-3-1998, Dr.
K Anji Reddy, the Chairman of the companies has, stated that these companies
are the vehicles of investment of himself and his family members and are part
of promoters group and the shares were preferentially allotted to prevent any
possible hostile take-over of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. In the light of the
above facts and evidences, it is to be held that the appellant-companies were
doing the business in shares of group companies.
6\. There is a clear nexus between the benefits derived by the appellant-
companies and the business carried on by them. The appellant-companies were
engaged in the activities of promoting Dr. Reddys Laboratories Companies. The
preferential allotment was made in appreciation of the services rendered by
the appellant-companies in this regard. This is clear from the Minutes of the
Extraordinary General Meeting of Dr. Reddys Laboratories (P) Ltd. held on
16-3-1994. It is recorded therein that the promoters should be allowed to take
preferential offer of shares for the contribution made by them in the field of
drugs. It is clear therefore, that the shares were allotted in appreciation of
the services rendered by them. Rendering of services is a business activity
and the nature of services may be varied. Reliance placed on
(i) Bhavnagar Bones & Fertilisers Co. Ltd.s case (supra)
(ii) Lakshminarayan Ram Gopal & Son Ltd. v. Government of Hyderabad (1954) 25
ITR 449 (SC).
7\. The assessing officer held on the above grounds that the appellant-
companies have derived benefits in acquiring the shares through the
preferential allotment and the benefit has been arisen out of business carried
on by them. Accordingly, the assessing officer confirmed her proposition and
added Rs. 32,85,00,000 to the income of M/s. KNP Investments (P) Ltd. and Rs.
29,70,73,500 to the income of M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd.
12\. When the assessments were challenged in first appeals before the
Commissioner (Appeals), the appellant-companies urged the following further
grounds of objections in addition to the grounds already raised at the time of
assessments
12\. When the assessments were challenged in first appeals before the
Commissioner (Appeals), the appellant-companies urged the following further
grounds of objections in addition to the grounds already raised at the time of
assessments
1\. The appellant companies were not in existence at the time of assessments
as they ceased to exist with effect from 1-10-1994, when they merged into Dr.
Reddys Holdings Ltd. as a result of amalgamation. Therefore, the impugned
assessments are void ab initio and liable to be quashed. Reliance placed on
CIT v. Express Newspapers Ltd. (1960) 40 ITR 38 (Mad).
13\. The learned Commissioner (Appeals) examined this ground in detail and
held that the assessments are valid in view of the provisions contained in
section 292B, read with section 170(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

held that the assessments are valid in view of the provisions contained in

14\. On the other grounds, invariably raised before the assessing officer
also, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) made the following findings
14\. On the other grounds, invariably raised before the assessing officer
also, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) made the following findings
1\. As per the Memorandum and Articles of Association, the main objects of the
appellant-companies were (a) to carry on the business of investment; (b) to
assist or aid in promoting companies; and (c) to buy and sell moveable assets
of all kinds.
2\. In the merger petition filed before the Honble High Court, the appellant
companies have stated to have carried on business of investment in securities
and shares and finances.
3\. The appellant companies have been consistently filing their returns of
income declaring income under the head Profits and gains of business or
profession and they raised the objections that they were not carrying on
business only when it was proposed under section 28(iv).
4\. The appellant companies have helped in promoting Dr. Reddys Laboratories
Ltd. and other group-companies by way of substantial subscription to promoters
equity, pledging its shares to banks for the benefit of Dr. Reddys
Laboratories Ltd.
5\. The assessee-companies have invested in the shares on borrowed funds and
the return from such investments being negligible, the investments have to be
held as made for earning profit at the time of sale at a later date.
6\. The contention of the appellant-companies that the shares were acquired
for controlling interest in Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. was not proper as
even after the preferential allotment of shares, the promoters group including
the appellant-companies did not hold more than 50 per cent of the issued
shares of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd.
7\. The appellant-companies entered into agreement with Margadarshi Financiers
for forward sale of substantial shares of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd.,
immediately after the preferential allotment.
8\. Taking into account the totality of the facts of the case and in view of
the legal position as pronounced by the Supreme Court in CIT v. Distributors
(Baroda) (P) Ltd. (1972) 83 ITR 377 (SC) and Madras High Court in CIT v.
Amalgamations (P) Ltd (1977) 108 ITR 895 (Mad), the appellant-companies did
carry on the business of holding of investment.
9\. Since the benefit has arisen to the appellant-companies from its business
of holding of investment, it is rightly taxed under section 28(iv) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961.
15\. On the basis of the above findings, the learned Commissioner (Appeals)
confirmed the respective additions made under section 28(iv) and dismissed the
appeals filed by the appellant-companies.
15\. On the basis of the above findings, the learned Commissioner (Appeals)
confirmed the respective additions made under section 28(iv) and dismissed the
appeals filed by the appellant-companies.
16\. Now in these appeals, the appellant-companies have raised five sets of
grounds before us. The first ground relates to the legal objection that the
assessing officer has gone wrong in completing the impugned assessments in the
names of the appellant-companies, who are non-existing and therefore, the
assessments are void ab initio and bad in law. The third ground relates to the
contention that the Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in confirming the
assessment treating the benefit as taxable in the impugned assessment year
1995-96 instead of the assessment year 1994-95. Any how, at the time of
hearing, Shri S.E. Dastur, the learned senior counsel, informed the court that
these two grounds are not pressed any more. In the circumstances, ground Nos.
1 and 3 relating to the legal objection and the assessment year respectively
are dismissed as not pressed.

These issues are contained in Ground Nos. II, IV and V respectively stated in
the grounds of appeals filed before us.
18\. The principal ground No. II reads as follows
18\. The principal ground No. II reads as follows "Ground II
1\. The Commissioner (Appeals) erred in confirming the action of the Asstt.
Commissioner of Income Tax, Company Circle 4(5), Hyderabad by holding that the
benefit has arisen to the appellant on the preferential and concessional
allotment of shares of Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. (hereinafter referred to
as the "TRL") in terms of section 28(iv) of the Act.
2\. He further erred in making various immaterial, irrelevant and/or incorrect
observations and conclusions which were contrary to and in total disregard of
the actual facts and/or on misconstrued facts and were based purely on
inferences, surmises, conjectures and including in particular that the
appellant company did indulge in real substantial organised course of activity
with the set purpose of earning profit and in view of that it was carrying on
the business of holding of investments.
3\. He failed to appreciate and ought to have held that :
(a) The appellant company was investment company and was holding shares of
group companies including shares of DRL and as such had derived income from
investment in shares and securities;
(b) the preferential allotment of shares in DRL so made to the appellant and
the shares obtained pursuant thereto were not for any other purpose but was to
enhance and consolidate the managing groups control;
(c) the mere fact that a loan had been raised with the help of a part of the
total holding did not in any way suggest an intention to dabble in profit
making activities through dealing;
(d) the fact of a loan being obtained by an investor would be wholly
irrelevant in judging whether the assessee was holding the shares as
investment or stock-in-trade;
(e) a switch of investments to enhance management control did not necessarily
spell that there existed an adventure in nature of trade or was carrying on
business;
(f) there was no material to establish the only motive of the appellant in
purchasing the equity shares in DRL was to sell them at profit;
(g) even if one assumes that the sale was with a view to make profit that
alone could not be the criteria for deciding that there was a business
intention;
(h) it is a settled law that the profit motive in entering into a transaction
would not be decisive for determination of the issue and an accretion to
capital could not be taxed as business income;
(i) the finding given by the Supreme Court in Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd.s
case 83 ITR 377 (SC) was with reference to expression business of holding of
investments specifically used in section 23A of Indian Income Tax Act, 1922
and confers companies whose primary or principal source of income is house
property or capital gains as well;
(j) mere fact that the company was incorporated to carry on business of
investments did not show that it was carrying on business;
(k) the mere holding of shares as investment could not amount to business
within the meaning of the term business used in the Income Tax Act;
(l) the Appellant was not the promoter of DRL and they had never rendered any
services in connection with the formation or promotion of the company and that
it had never aided in promoting DRL;
(m) the onus to prove that the transaction was an adventure in trade or
business was on the department and that the Asstt. Commissioner had failed to
prove the same;
(n) it is a settled law that the Memorandum is not conclusive proof for or
against the activity carried by the assessee;
(o) the issue of the said equity shares in DRL on preferential basis to the
appellant was on capital account and not on revenue account;
(p) there was no benefit or perquisite arising on account of issue of
preferential equity shares in DRL;
(q) the appellant had no right, much less vested right, to receive the equity
shares from DRL at concessional price and as such no perquisite or benefit can
be said to have arisen;
(r) there was no nexus between the business of the appellant, if at all any,
and the benefit which the appellant had derived, if at all any;
(s) the question of the applicability of provisions of section 28(iv) did not
arise inasmuch as the value of benefit or perquisite was not arising from
business; and
(t) on the facts and circumstances of the case, the said addition was
unjustified and unwarranted.
4\. The appellant prays that it be held that the difference of the price of
allotment of shares in DRL, at preferential rate and prices of shares quoted
on stock exchange on the date of allotment of the shares could not be brought
to tax under section 28(iv) of the Act."
19\. The grounds regarding the valuation of benefit are as follows :
19\. The grounds regarding the valuation of benefit are as follows :
"Without Prejudice to Above Ground-IV
1\. The Commissioner (Appeals) erred in confirming the action of the Asstt.
Commissioner in considering the market value of shares in DRL at Rs. 455 per
shares as quoted on Stock Exchange on 6-5-1994.
2\. He failed to appreciate and ought to be held that :
(a) the said shares allotted on preferential basis were subject to lock in
period of 3 years as per the guidelines issued by Securities and Exchange
Board of India and as such were not transferable for three years and that the
same could not be treated on par with those that were regularly traded in
Stock Exchange; and
(b) the lock-in-period and the vagaries of share market should undoubtedly
have to be borne in mind in determining the quantum of benefit.
3\. The appellant prays that the fair value of shares in DRL be taken at
break-up value method for the purpose of computing the value of benefit.
4\. Without prejudice, the appellant prays that the market value of the shares
in DRL after expiry of lock in period of 3 years be taken for the purpose of
computing the value of benefit."
20\. The interest issue is agitated in Ground-V as follows
20\. The interest issue is agitated in Ground-V as follows "Ground-V
1\. The Commissioner (Appeals) erred in not considering the ground relating to
chargeability of interest of Rs. 10,88,10,331 under section 234B and Rs. 4,649
under section 234C of the Act.
2\. He failed to appreciate and ought to have held that in the facts and
circumstances of the case there can be no levy of interest under sections 234B
and 234C of the Act.
3\. The Appellant prays that the levy of interest of Rs. 10,88,10,331 under
section 234B and Rs. 4,649 under section 234C be deleted."
21\. Let us first examine the ground whether section 28(iv) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 is applicable in these cases or not. Shri S.E. Dastur, the learned
senior counsel appearing for the companies dealt with the issue in an
extensive manner. He explained the legal situation that the appellant-
companies would be caught in the web of section 28(iv) only if all the
following circumstances are satisfied with reference to the appellant-
companies and their acquisition of shares through preferential allotment.
While explaining the circumstances, the learned senior counsel first took us
to the provisions of section 28 of the Act with special reference to clauses
(i) and (iv) thereof. They read as follows :

While explaining the circumstances, the learned senior counsel first took us
to the provisions of section 28 of the Act with special reference to clauses
(i) and (iv) thereof. They read as follows :
"28. The following income shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head
profits and gains of business or profession
(i) the profits and gains of any business or profession which was carried on
by the assessee at any time during the previous year;
*** *** *** *** *** ***
(iv) the value of any benefit or perquisite, whether convertible into money or
not, arising from business or the exercise of a profession
....................."
22\. The learned senior counsel stated that in the scheme of the above
provisions, clause (iv) would be applicable only in the preface of clause (i)
above. Therefore, according to him, the said circumstances are as follows :
22\. The learned senior counsel stated that in the scheme of the above
provisions, clause (iv) would be applicable only in the preface of clause (i)
above. Therefore, according to him, the said circumstances are as follows :
1\. That the appellant-companies should have carried on any business at any
time during the previous year,
2\. That there should be a benefit arising to the appellant-companies;
3\. That the benefit must be one arising from the business carried on by the
appellant-companies;
4\. That the benefit, if any, must be revenue in character; must be of income
in nature;
5\. That the benefit has arisen to the appellant-companies in a business
transaction they had with Dr. Reddy Laboratories Ltd. (DRL).
23\. He contended that none of the above circumstances have been satisfied in
the case of the appellant-company. M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd. and M/s. KAR
Investments (P) Ltd.; and absolutely there is no justification to hold that
the appellant-companies have enjoyed any benefit taxable under section 28(iv).
M/s. DRL, was contemplating an Euro-Issue of shares. In that context, DRL was
quite anxious to retain the control of its promoters even after the Euro
issue. In fact, the promoters meant Dr. K. Anji Reddy, the Chairman of the
group companies; Shri M.P. Chary and their family members and close
associates. The appellant-companies, M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd. and M/s.
KAR Investments (P) Ltd. have already been holding shares in DRL and other
group companies in the context of group control exercised by these closely
held persons. When such a contingency arose, so as to retain the group
control, DRL had to issue shares by way of preferential allotment. Group
control could be retained only if they could block the passing of a special
resolution in a meeting for which the share-holding should not be less than 25
per cent. This is because a special resolution needs a 3/4th majority. When
the Euro-issue was contemplated, the promoters have enjoyed a share-holding of
more than 27 per cent. It was in order to retain at least that level of share-
holding, a preferential allotment of 22,50,000 shares was made. As a result of
that preferential allotment, the group enjoyed almost the same level of share-
holding even after the Euro-issue. But for the preferential allotment, this
would not have been possible. As the only intent and purpose of preferential
allotment was to retain the group control in the share-holding of DRL the
allotments were made to the appellant-companies, M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd.
and M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd. it could not have been allotted to the
public at large through market as argued by the revenue, as that would defeat
the very purpose of preferential issue itself. The appellant-company, also had
no intention to procure the shares of DRL from the market. Therefore, the
preferential allotment of shares does not partake the character of a business
transaction. As the event was not a business transaction, the provisions of
section 28(iv) would not apply. The appellant-companies have not been carrying
on any business. They were only holding the shares of group companies. They
had not dealt in the purchase and sale of shares and securities. The entire
income of the appellant-companies during the previous year comprised only of
dividends and interest. They have not invested in the shares of any outside
companies; nor did they deal in the shares of these companies. The appellant-
companies have not indulged in any systematic or organised activities in any
line of business, including investment. Their expenditure related to certain
bare minimum establishment expenses only. In the circumstances, it could not
be held that the appellant-companies have been carrying on any business during
the relevant previous year. While referring to the Memorandum of Association
of the appellant-companies, the statements and affidavits filed before the
Honble Andhra Pradesh High Court in the context of amalgamation proceedings,
filing of returns for earlier assessment years disclosing income under
business head etc., the lower authorities were only mentioning to peripheral
and irrelevant issues and they are not decisive in looking into the real
question whether the appellant-companies have carried on any business during
the previous year. The Memorandum of Association of a company may include a
number of object clauses. Generally, they are enabling clauses by which a
company can carry on its activities in any of those areas covered by those
clauses. But those enabling clauses are not invariably the test to decide the
exact nature of activities carried on by a company. The nature of the activity
has to be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances relating to
each transaction. DRL and the appellant-companies had no business connection
or any business activities with each other. The appellant-companies are only
holding shares of group companies. They are not dealing in shares and
securities. They do not have the infrastructure to do such business. The
preferential issue of shares has been made only with the intention of
retaining the group control in DRL even after the Euro-issue. In the
circumstances, it could not be held that the appellant-companies have been
doing investment business or for that matter, that the appellant-companies
have been doing the business of holding of investment. The appellant-companies
have only been holding shares of group companies and they have not been
holding any investments in other companies.
23\. He contended that none of the above circumstances have been satisfied in
the case of the appellant-company. M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd. and M/s. KAR
Investments (P) Ltd.; and absolutely there is no justification to hold that

the relevant previous year. While referring to the Memorandum of Association
of the appellant-companies, the statements and affidavits filed before the
Honble Andhra Pradesh High Court in the context of amalgamation proceedings,
filing of returns for earlier assessment years disclosing income under
business head etc., the lower authorities were only mentioning to peripheral

or any business activities with each other. The appellant-companies are only
holding shares of group companies. They are not dealing in shares and

preferential issue of shares has been made only with the intention of
retaining the group control in DRL even after the Euro-issue. In the

doing investment business or for that matter, that the appellant-companies
have been doing the business of holding of investment. The appellant-companies
have only been holding shares of group companies and they have not been
holding any investments in other companies.
24\. Having argued that the appellant-companies have not been doing any kind
of business and the preferential allotment of shares in M/s. DRL was not a
transaction in the nature of business, the learned senior counsel further
argued that no benefit has arisen to the appellant-companies by way of
preferential allotment of shares. The shares allotted to appellant-companies
could not be sold for a lock-in period of three years. That was a mandatory
condition of preferential issue. The share issue has been made observing all
the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange
Board of India Regulations. It has been done in accordance with all the
existing laws and regulations. The preferential allotment of shares was not a
manipulative scheme. There was no secret agenda. Everything was transparent.
The allotted shares were not quoted in the stock exchange. It cannot be sold
for three years. As such, it is very absurd to presume that the shares are
comparable to the market value of shares quoted in the stock exchange. The so-
called benefit presumed by the department could be crystallised only if the
shares could be sold on the date of allotment. If those shares could not be
sold in the market, there is no market value for those shares issued through
preferential allotment. Therefore, there is no meaning in comparing the issue
price of Rs. 90 per share to the market price of Rs. 455 per quoted share. As
such a comparison is unfounded. Accordingly, no benefit has arisen by virtue
of preferential allotment of shares. If at all benefit has to be derived, the
shares have to be sold. That could be made only after three years. One does
not know what would be the market price after three years from the date of
preferential allotment. The quoted price of Dr. Reddys Laboratories during the
23-5-1994 had fluctuated between a high price of Rs. 560 per share to a low
price of Rs. 62.50 per share. The average price was Rs. 248 per annum.
Therefore, it is very unsafe to hold that the sale of those shares would fetch
a profit compared to the issue price. The price may even come down. As the
situation was uncertain regarding the sale price at the time of sale, no
benefit could be considered on the basis of the difference between the market
price and the issue price on the date of allotment if at all there could be a
profit on sale of shares allotted on preference, that profit would arise only
at a future date after three years on the expiry of the lock-in-period.
Therefore, at the maximum, the concept of benefit could only be prospective. A
prospective or potential benefit could not be considered as income of the
previous year in terms of section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act.
24\. Having argued that the appellant-companies have not been doing any kind
of business and the preferential allotment of shares in M/s. DRL was not a
transaction in the nature of business, the learned senior counsel further
argued that no benefit has arisen to the appellant-companies by way of
preferential allotment of shares. The shares allotted to appellant-companies
could not be sold for a lock-in period of three years. That was a mandatory

Therefore, at the maximum, the concept of benefit could only be prospective. A
prospective or potential benefit could not be considered as income of the
previous year in terms of section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act.
25\. The learned senior counsel further argued that the benefit contemplated
in section 28(iv) is a real benefit in the character of a positive income. It
cannot be negative or unreal. While allotting shares at Rs. 90 per share as
against the prevailing market price of Rs. 455 per share, what in fact the
appellant-companies could have was only a saving in the cost of acquisition of
shares. A price-saver or a reduction in the purchase price cannot be construed
as benefit in the nature of income. He invited our attention to a relevant
Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular explaining the intent and purpose of
clause (iv) of section 28, according to which the benefit should be a tangible
one in consideration of a business transaction. The learned senior counsel
submitted that the issue price of Rs. 90 per share was not determined
arbitrarily. The issue price is supported by a contemporaneous valuation
report prepared by M/s. C.C. Chokshi & Co., Mumbai. As the preferential issue
of shares had no comparison with market price, the issue price was rightly
fixed in comparison with the valuation report. Therefore, there could not be
any benefit for the appellant-companies in acquiring shares at Rs. 90 per
share.

in section 28(iv) is a real benefit in the character of a positive income. It

fixed in comparison with the valuation report. Therefore, there could not be
any benefit for the appellant-companies in acquiring shares at Rs. 90 per
share.
26\. Without prejudice to contentions noted above, the learned senior counsel
further submitted that if at all there was any benefit arising to the
appellant-companies, that was not in the nature of income contemplated in
section 28 of the Income Tax Act as the benefit would be capital in nature and
not revenue. He contended that the acquisition of shares was made for the
purpose of Management Control and not for the purpose of any trading or
business. Therefore, those shares are in the nature of capital and not stock-
in-trade. Therefore, any benefit arising out of such capital asset would only
be capital in nature. Therefore, the same could not be a subject-matter of
discussion under section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

discussion under section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
27\. He also submitted that cash payments are outside the purview of section
28(iv) of the Income Tax Act. He contended that none of the circumstances
necessary to invoke section 28(iv) existed in the present case, and therefore,
the whole exercise of the assessing officer was quite uncalled for. He stated
that the mandatory circumstances did not exist because

necessary to invoke section 28(iv) existed in the present case, and therefore,
the whole exercise of the assessing officer was quite uncalled for. He stated
that the mandatory circumstances did not exist because
1\. The appellant-companies have not carried on any business, but only held
selected shares;
2\. They do not have any business relationship with DRL.
3\. The transaction of allotment of shares was not in the nature of business.
4\. Therefore, the benefit if any could not be held to be arising out of
business.
5\. No benefit arising as savings in expenditure is not income;
6\. The benefit if any, again is not revenue in nature; and
7\. Cash payment does not attract section 28(iv).
28\. The learned senior counsel finally consolidated his propositions in the
following lines
28\. The learned senior counsel finally consolidated his propositions in the
following lines
1\. For there to be a benefit to be taxed under section 28(iv), there must be
business income taxable under section 28(1) in the first place. Where there is
no business, there can be no taxation of a perquisite or benefit, as that must
arise from the business carried on under section 28(1).
2\. The appellant-companies having neither sold the shares of DRL (except one
solitary transaction of sale by M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd) nor any other
with a view to make profit by means of a systematic and organised activity of
investment, it cannot be said to be in business of holding investments as
considered by the Supreme Court in Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd.s case
(supra) at page 383.
3\. Admittedly, the appellant-companies have no infrastructure; have not
carried out any business activity; and have no income from business, and the
fact that in the earlier assessment years the appellant-companies have been
assessed to business income, when in fact it had only income from dividends,
is not a conclusive factor, and there cannot be any estoppel on this count.
Reliance is placed on the following decisions
(a) Addl. CIT v. Smt. Indira Bai (1985) 151 ITR 692 (AP);
(b) CIT v. Shri Padmavathi Cotton Mills (1999) 236 ITR 340 (Mad);
(c) Dy. CIT v. Nagarjuna Investment Trust Ltd. (1998) 65 ITD 17 (Hyd)(SB);
(d) Renuka Dhanda Trust v. ITO (1987) 20 ITD 61 (Delhi).
4\. The appellant-companies are not the promoters of DRL, and even as per the
definitions extracted by the assessing officer the appellant-companies could
not have promoted and formed the DRL, as the DRL was promoted and formed prior
to the incorporation of the appellant-companies.
5\. The option sale agreement with Margadarsi was a loan transaction coupled
with security and concluded as a loan transaction with interest at a rate 12.5
per cent.
6\. Facilitating the obtaining of a loan by DRL in the past by pledging shares
of DRL held by the appellant-companies was not a business transaction as no
fee was charged.
7\. Admittedly the shares even as per the assessing officer are capital assets
at all points in time. Thus any benefit if any could only be on capital
account which would be taxed when the shares were transferred. The shares of
DRL were never purchased from the open market but acquired by way of
subscription, rights, bonus etc.
8\. Where assets are purchased with a view to obtaining control whether with
borrowed funds or not, the profit from the sale of those assets would be on
capital account and it would not amount to a business activity. Reliance is
placed on the following decisions
(a) Bengal & Assam Investors Ltd. v. CIT (1966) 59 ITR 547 (SC);
(b) Rameshwar Prasad Bagla v. CIT (1973) 87 ITR 421 (SC) and
(c) CIT v. H. Holck Larsen (1986) 160 ITR 67 (SC).
9\. In the abovementioned cases, the Honble Supreme Court has categorically
stated that the fact that the objects in the Memorandum of Association
provided for trading in shares or the fact that the appellant had borrowed to
purchase the assets or shares was a factor which did not detract from the fact
that the shares were on capital account.
10\. In fact propositions above are also supported by the decision of the
Honble Supreme Court in Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd.s case (supra), the
principle that the shares purchased with a view to obtaining a managing agency
would not be stock-in-trade, namely business assets. There has been no
systematic organised activity of investment with a view to making profit in
order to make the activity carried on by the appellant as the business of
holding investment.
11\. Where in accordance with law and after compliance with the requisite
legal formalities under Securities and Exchange Board of India or under the
Companies Act/law shares are purchased at lesser price", section 28(iv) cannot
apply as it does not apply to cases where an assessee is able to purchase at a
lesser price. It can only apply to cases where the assessee is able to secure
a tangible benefit in consideration of a business transaction. This is made
explicitly clear by the Circular of the Central Board of Direct Taxes, at the
time of introduction of section 28(iv).
12\. As held by the Gujarat High Court in CIT v. Spunpipe & Construction Co.
Ltd. (1965) 55 ITR 68, where assets are purchased for lesser price, there can
be no profit made by the purchaser on revenue account from the purchase at a
lesser price.
13\. In any event and without prejudice to the above, the benefit or
perquisite sought to be taxed must be one arising in the course of business
carried on. In other words, it must be "in consideration of a business
transaction between the two parties". This proposition is supported by the
following decisions
(a) Bhavnagar Bone and Fertilizer Ltd.s case (supra)
(b) CIT v. Western Rolling Mills Ltd. (1994) 72 Taxman 155 (Bom);
(c) CIT v. General Electrodes & Equipments Ltd. (1985) 155 ITR 78 (Bom);
(d) CIT v. Smt. Chetanaben B. Sheth (1993) 203 ITR 24 (Guj);
(e) CIT v. Balvantrai Vithaldas Shah (1994) 196 ITR 379 (Guj);
-besides the relevant Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular. 
14\. The benefit if at all arises on capital account not from exercise of
business cannot be assessed under section 28(iv). Reliance is placed in this
behalf on the following decisions
(a) Comfund Financial Services (I) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT (1998) 67 ITD 304 (Bang);
(b) Smt. Chetanaben B. Sheths case (supra).
15\. The decision of the Honble Rajasthan High Court cited by the learned
Departmental Representative in CIT v. R.L. Kasliwal (1994) 207 ITR 208 is
clearly distinguishable as in that case, the appellant had himself returned an
amount of Rs. 4,000, under section 28(iv).
The only question was whether in view of the expenditure expended by the firm
on renovation of the premises it would be enhanced to Rs. 9,000. It was
primarily a case of valuation of the benefit. Also, it was a case where a
tangible benefit was received by an assessee, and not a case where assets are
purchased at a lesser price.
16\. The issue of shares at a lesser price would have normally resulted in a
liability to gift-tax in the hands of DRL and just because the provisions of
the Gift Tax Act was not applicable (see section 45 of the Gift Tax Act) to
DRL, being a company the shares of which are quoted on the stock market cannot
mean that a liability arises under section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act.
17\. In any event in view of the value of the shares having been determined by
M/s. C.C. Chokshi & Co., at Rs. 88 issue at Rs. 90 is fully supportable.
18\. In view of the lock-in-period statutorily required of the said shares the
appellant companies did not have any benefit or perquisite accruing in the
said assessment year. In any event, the value of the shares could only be
taken without prejudice to the above at the market value prevailing on the
expiry of the lock-in-period, viz, Rs. 217.
19\. The wide fluctuations in the quoted price from time to time shows that
where there is a lock-in-period one cannot assess a benefit on the basis of
the then prevailing market price.
The facts specifically stated in the above prepositions mainly relate to the
case of M/s. KNB Investments (P) Ltd., but the facts are similar in the case
of M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd., except that there was no transfer of any
share of diano Hotels and there as one solitary transaction of sale of DRL
shares. In the preceding previous year M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd. had sold
4,000 shares of DRL to Globe Organics (P) Ltd. to extinguish the loan it had
obtained from Globe Organics itself. The loan was taken by M/s KAR Investments
in respect of a buy-back arrangement with IDBI and IFCI of shares held by them
in Globe Organics. There was no business "as such", nor at any time prior or
thereafter M/s. KAR Investments ever sold any of its holdings in DRL.
29\. Shri C.P. Ramaswamy, the learned Senior Departmental Representative
appearing for the department contended that all the arguments made by the
learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellant-companies, are purposefully
drifting away from the essential facts of the case and the laws relevant
thereto. The learned Departmental Representative stated that the statutory
documents of the appellant-companies like Memorandum of Association, etc.,
have clearly stated the nature of business carried on by the appellant-
companies. The appellant-companies are doing business in investments, the
investment by itself is a recognised business, and there is no point in saying
that the appellant-companies were not carrying on any business at all. He also
stated that the assessing officer has apprehended that even the minute books
reflecting the proceedings in Annual General Meetings, where the business
carried on and the business prospects might have been discussed by the members
of the companies were fabricated to suit the convenience of the appellant-
companies. The appellant-companies stated before the Honble High Court of
Andhra Pradesh through various petitions and affidavits and statements made in
the context of amalgamation proceedings that the appellant-companies have been
carrying on business in investment. The appellant-companies have been filing
their returns of income for all the assessment years under the head profits
and gains of business or profession, and at no point of time, the appellant-
companies had raised any contention that they were not carrying on business.
The learned Departmental Representative submitted that the assessing officer
has extensively dealt with this matter and has clearly established that the
appellant-companies have been carrying on business as investment companies.
The learned Departmental Representative also pointed out the benefit enjoyed
by the appellant-companies, by availing the facility of preferential allotment
of shares. He submitted that the shares of DRL are quoted at Stock Exchange at
Rs. 455 per share, whereas the appellant-companies got the same for Rs. 90 per
share. The allotment was not made to the public at large, including its
existing shareholders, other than the appellant-companies. The benefit of
concessional rate or preferential allotment was not extended to all the
shareholders, but it was extended only to selected members, viz., the two
appellant-companies. By virtue of this discretion itself, it is quite apparent
that the preferential allotment of shares was made with a specific intention
of conferring benefits on the appellant-companies. The learned senior
Departmental Representative further pointed out that there is no point in
distinguishing between the benefit so derived under section 28(iv) as capital
or revenue. Since the benefit has arisen out of the business carried on by the
assessee, and as such it is treated as benefit, there is no further need of
examining the nature of that benefit, viz., capital or revenue. Such
characterisation is not contemplated under the provisions contained in section
28(iv) of the Act. The learned Departmental Representative further submitted
that by holding the shares of the selected companies and earning income by way
of interest on those shares or by earning profit on the sale of those shares,
the appellant-companies are at least doing the business of holding the
investments. This proposition has been correctly pointed out by the learned
Commissioner (Appeals) in the impugned order, relying on the decisions in
Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd.s case (supra) and Amalgamations (P) Ltd.s case
(supra). The Honble Supreme Court has recognised the principle that holding of
investments itself is a business. Once carrying on of the business is proved,
the next question to be considered is whether there is a benefit. Without
explaining those things in very many words, it is absolutely clear, the
learned Departmental Representative argued, that the appellant companies have
acquired the shares of DRL at the rate of Rs. 90 per share, though the
prevailing rate of the same in the market at the relevant time was Rs. 455 per
share. Consequently, the differential price partakes the character of benefit
and comes under the purview of section 28(iv) of the Act. The benefit,
according to him, is certain and it is correctly valued. Therefore, the
learned Departmental Representative submitted that the present cases coming
under the circumstances explained by the learned senior counsel for the
assessee, are clearly caught in the web of section 28(iv) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. The appellant companies, according to him have derived benefit
coming under section 28(iv) of the Act. He submitted that the conditions
necessary for attracting clause (iv) of section 28 have been satisfied in
these cases, in the following manner

coming under section 28(iv) of the Act. He submitted that the conditions
necessary for attracting clause (iv) of section 28 have been satisfied in
these cases, in the following manner
(i) That the appellant-companies had carried on business of dealing in
investments during the previous year;
(ii) That the appellant-companies have derived benefit out of the transactions
in question;
(iii) That the benefits derived by the appellant-companies have arisen from
the business carried on by them;
(iv) That the benefits have arisen to the appellant-companies in the business
transaction which the appellants had with M/s. DRL.
(v) That there is no legal compulsion to examine the question whether the
benefit derived by the appellant-companies is of capital or revenue nature.
30\. The learned senior Departmental Representative has filed a synopsis of
the departments submissions. In support of its contention that the assessee
carried on the business of holding of investments, it is stated therein that
the assessee-companies had a systematic, organised, continuous activity of
investing in the equity of group companies as evident from the Balance Sheets.
Investments are made in a number of group companies on a regular basis,
whenever group companies needed to raise funds. The appellant-companies have
also admitted to have carried on business of investments in shares and
securities through the Memorandum of Association; reports of the auditors;
reports of Official Liquidators; returns of income filed for earlier years;
and submissions made before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the
amalgamation proceedings. Holding of investments is a business activity, as
recognised by the Honble Supreme Court in Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd.s case
(supra). That principle was applied by the Madras High Court in Amalgamations
(P) Ltd.s case (supra). M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd. had sold 4,000 shares of
DRL in financial year 1993-94 at Rs. 1255 per share, which is the market price
prevailing at that time, to another group company. Both the appellants had
entered into forward contracts with M/s. Margadarsi Financiers for the sale of
the shares of DRL held by them. So also, the appellants had pledged the shares
with Canbank Mutual Fund and ANZ Grindlays bank for obtaining loan for DRL.
They have also pledged the shares to the Lead Managers of the GDR issue of
DRL. It is also to be seen that the appellant-companies have fabricated their
minute books in order to conceal the real activities carried on by them in the
form of business. Adverse inference has to be necessarily drawn on the basis
of this situation.

form of business. Adverse inference has to be necessarily drawn on the basis
of this situation.
2\. On the aspect of benefit involved in the preferential allotment of shares
in question, it is stated that there is clearly benefit to the appellant-
companies in the preferential allotment of shares. The appellant-companies
could obtain the shares of DRL at Rs. 90 per share, though the market value of
the same was Rs. 455 per share at the relevant time. It is to be seen that
this opportunity was not available to any other person of the public and not
even to the other existing shareholders of the DRL. This benefit, it is stated
is analogous to the benefit construed in section 17(2)(iii) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. As per the Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular No. 710 dated
21-1-1995, where an employee is allotted shares in the company at less than
the market value, the difference between the market value and issue price is
assessable as benefit under that section. This has now been incorporated as
section 17(2)(iiia) with effect from 1-4-2000. The benefit under section
28(iv) is analogous. The lock-in period prescribed in the share issue in the
present cases does not take away the benefit enjoyed by the appellants in
these cases. There is thus, accretion to the net worth of the appellant-
companies and such accretion has come at a cheaper rate compared to the cost
of acquisition of shares at the market rates. The credit rating agencies
generally treat such benefit as secret reserve.
3\. On the aspect of the departments contention that the benefit in question
has arisen from a business transaction, it is pointed out that the purchase of
the preferential shares was just one other investment transaction of the
appellant-companies in the business of holding investments, and therefore, the
benefit has directly arisen from the business transaction in the ordinary
course. The words used in section 28(iv) are arising from, which have wider
import as opposed to the words derived from. Reliance is placed in this behalf
on the following decisions
(a) V.P. Warrier v. CIT (1990) 181 ITR 303 (MP);
(b) R.L. Kasliwals case (supra);
(c) Protos Engineer Co. (P) Ltd. v. CIT (1995) 211 ITR 919 (Bom);
(d) Oil India Ltd. v. CIT (1995) 212 ITR 225 (Ori).
4\. Reiterating its stand that the benefit involved in the present cases is
clearly income under section 2(24), it is stated that the question whether the
benefit in question is of capital or revenue nature does not arise because of
section 2(24)(vd). It is stated further that it is not necessary for every
assessee to have every type of income listed in section 28.
5\. It is argued that the sale of 4,000 shares by M/s KAR Investments (P) Ltd.
during the financial year 1993-94 at Rs. 1,255 and forward contract for sale
of shares to M/s Margadarsi Financiers at Rs. 500 per share or average
quotation of preceding 15 trading days, are clearly indicators to the
assessees own estimation of the value of the shares procured through the
preferential allotment. Therefore, it is clear that the benefit arising to the
appellant-companies could be clearly and precisely measured. Reliance is
placed in this behalf on the following decisions
(a) CIT v. Amalgamations (P) Ltd. (1977) 108 ITR 895 (Mad);
(b) CIT v. Amalgamations (P) Ltd. (1997) 226 ITR 188 (SC).
6\. The learned Departmental Representative has also submitted replies of the
department item-wise to the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the
appellant-companies in a tabular form. He has also attempted in the said
tabulation, to distinguish the various case-laws cited by the learned counsel
for the assessee.
31\. We heard both sides in detail. We considered the rival contentions and
the relevant arguments advanced from both sides. We have also gone through the
paper-books and brief synopsis filed for the appellant-companies and the
revenue. Regarding the paper-books filed before us, we have scanned through
the relevant and necessary papers only and have not considered anything in the
nature of fresh materials and/or additional evidence.

32\. The appellant-companies have acquired the shares at Rs. 90 per share
through the preferential allotment made by DRL. The prevailing market price at
that time was Rs. 455 per share. The differential price is Rs. 365 per share.
Whether this price differential availed by the appellant-companies amounts to
benefit arising from business or not, is the issue to be decided in these
appeals.

33\. The shares on the basis of preferential allotment were made over to the
appellant-companies on 10-5-1994. The issue price was Rs. 90 per share; the
face value of the share was Rs. 10; and the premium of Rs. 80 per share. An
examination of certain contemporaneous facts relating to the share value of
DRL would be interesting at this stage. DRL Ltd. had obtained a share
valuation report, prepared by M/s. C.C. Chokshi & Co., Mumbai. The said Report
dated 19-9-1994 was prepared on the basis of the State of affairs of DRL as on
31-3-1994. The valuation report was obtained in the context of the
amalgamation scheme of M/s. Standard Equity Fund Ltd. and DRL with effect from
1-4-1994. The report is available from pages 60 to 101 of appellants paper-
book Vol. I. The shares have been valued on break-up method. Profitability
also has been taken into consideration linking between historical profits and
estimated future maintainable profit (Para 14.5 of the report-page-77 of
paper-book). On that basis, the shares of DRL have been valued at Rs. 90 per
share as on 31-3-1994 (Page 69 of paper-book-Annexure C of the report-Paras
11.3 and 11.4 of the report). The above value of Rs. 90 per share has been
worked out before considering the Bonus issue, preferential issue and Euro
Issue of shares made by DRL Ltd. after 31-3-1994. When those issues were also
taken into consideration, the share value has come down to Rs. 88 per share.
In the said Valuation Report, the consultants have considered the price
fluctuations of the shares of DRL Ltd. in the stock market, for a period of 23
months ending May, 1994 (Para 16.7 of the Report Page 83 of paper-book Vol.
I). The market price has fluctuated from the highest price of Rs. 560 per
share in April 1994 to the lowest price of Rs. 62.50 per share in the third
quarter of 1992. The summary of the market values of DRL shares is given in
Annexure I to the Valuation Report (Page 101 of Paper-book Vol. I).
33\. The shares on the basis of preferential allotment were made over to the
appellant-companies on 10-5-1994. The issue price was Rs. 90 per share; the

quarter of 1992. The summary of the market values of DRL shares is given in
Annexure I to the Valuation Report (Page 101 of Paper-book Vol. I).
34\. On an examination of the contemporaneous facts considered in the above
paragraph, it is clear that the issue price of Rs. 90 per share is comparable
to the break-up value of shares. In such circumstances, when the market price
is not considered, where the net worth value alone is considered, the ultimate
reward for the appellant-companies is an eventual capital gain, supplemented
by a dividend yield. The reward of capital gains arises only when the
appellant-companies ultimately sell the shares of DRL for a higher price than
paid for the acquisition. The supplementary reward of dividend yield as such
does not bestow any benefit upon the appellant-companies. This is because the
dividend is declared on the basis of the face value of shares which is the
same for all the shareholders, irrespective of the price paid by them for the
acquisition of shares. This is the position when the issue price of DRL shares
is compared with that of Net worth Price/Value.
34\. On an examination of the contemporaneous facts considered in the above
paragraph, it is clear that the issue price of Rs. 90 per share is comparable
to the break-up value of shares. In such circumstances, when the market price
is not considered, where the net worth value alone is considered, the ultimate
reward for the appellant-companies is an eventual capital gain, supplemented
by a dividend yield. The reward of capital gains arises only when the
appellant-companies ultimately sell the shares of DRL for a higher price than
paid for the acquisition. The supplementary reward of dividend yield as such
does not bestow any benefit upon the appellant-companies. This is because the
dividend is declared on the basis of the face value of shares which is the
same for all the shareholders, irrespective of the price paid by them for the
acquisition of shares. This is the position when the issue price of DRL shares
is compared with that of Net worth Price/Value.
35\. Now coming to the case argued by the revenue, the benefit is contemplated
in the differential price of Rs. 365 per share on a comparison of issue price
of Rs. 90 per share with the market price of Rs. 455 per share. There is no
such benefit where the comparison is between the issue price and the net worth
value. The case of benefit is attempted on a comparison of the issue price and
market price. The contemplated benefit is a price saver in a context when the
issue price is compared to the then prevailing market rate. Or the
contemplated benefit is relative in nature; relative to the prevailing market
price. Even in circumstances where the issue price is compared to the market
price, there need not be such a relative benefit in all cases. In paragraph 33
above, we have seen the market price fluctuation in the case of DRL shares.
The share value was Rs. 62.50 per share in the market in the third quarter of
1992. If the present issue price of Rs. 90 per share is compared to the then
prevailing market price of Rs. 62.50 per share, it is obvious that there could
be no benefit or advantage. Therefore, the advantage or benefit on the basis
of a comparative price saver is subject to the market price prevailing on a
particular day.

36\. Where the benefit is related to the prevailing market price, the issue to
be considered is whether there is any sustainable basis for a comparison of
issue price with the market price. One of the objects of preferential
allotment of shares was to retain the control of Dr. K. Anji Reddy and his
associates in the ownership and management of DRL, even after the Euro-issue
of shares. This objective was made clear in the Explanatory statement
circulated by DRL among its shareholders, pursuant to section 173(2) of the
Companies Act, 1956. The Explanatory statement was a legal requirement to
accompany the notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting, where special
resolutions were proposed to be considered and passed. The relevant
explanation in respect of the preferential allotment of 22,50,000 equity
shares given as item No. 4 of the said statement reads as follows

accompany the notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting, where special
resolutions were proposed to be considered and passed. The relevant
explanation in respect of the preferential allotment of 22,50,000 equity
shares given as item No. 4 of the said statement reads as follows "In the
light of the proposed Euro-issue and to guard against any take over bid by any
other company, Indian or foreign that may arise out of the globalisation of
Indian Economy which is possible in the international corporate scenario
particularly in the Drug industry, it is felt desirable by the Board of
Directors that in the interest of the company, the promoter groups stake in
the equity of the company should be strengthened to enable them to have
effective control of the management of the company and to offer additional
equity shares at an affordable price to them."
(Page 04 of the Supplementary book filed by the appellant-companies) It is
with the above objective that the Special Resolution was passed on the basis
of which the preferential allotment of shares was made to the appellant-
companies. The shares were allotted observing the relevant provisions of law
contained in the Companies Act, 1956, Rules and Regulations formulated by
Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Stock Exchange. The statement
showing the percentage of holding by Dr. K. Anji Reddy and associates in DRL
before and after the Euro-issue is given in page 19 of the supplementary
paper-book. The percentage of holding before the Euro-issue and before
preferential allotment was 27.68 per cent. The percentage of holding after the
Euro-issue and preferential allotment was 27.31 per cent. This position is
almost comparable. If there was no preferential allotment of shares, then the
percentage of holding after the Euro-issue would have been 22.77 per cent. It
is clear that the promoters group was holding a percentage of more than 25 in
the equity of DRL, and they could retain or maintain the same level of holding
only because of the preferential issue of shares. If there was no such
preferential allotment, the groups holding would have come down to less than
25 per cent, to be precise at 22.77 per cent. As pointed out by the learned
Commissioner (Appeals), the promoters group never had a 51 per cent
shareholding in DRL so as to claim a majority and to stall any possible take
over bid. But, as rightly argued by Shri S.E. Dastur, the learned senior
counsel for the appellants, the minimum holding of at least 25 per cent always
helped the promoters group to block the passing of any special resolution
proposed by any hostile group at any point of time, as passing of Special
Resolution needed a minimum of 75 per cent of voting power. It means, the
promoters could retain their control over the management of the company even
after the Euro-issue. There should not be a misconception regarding the
majority shareholding and the effective group control in the management of
DRL. An absolute majority in the shareholding having more than 50 per cent of
voting power is of course the ideal situation for the promoters group in any
company. But in real life of corporate affairs, one hardly comes across such
an ideal and academic situation. Where there is no majority shareholding, the
next best alternative is to retain controlling interest by holding at least 25
per cent of the equity, so that effective control can be held in the day-to-
day affairs and policy management of the company. The status quo could be
maintained by avoiding basic changes in the dynamics of the company structure.
In this perspective, the preferential issue of shares by Dr. Reddys
Laboratories Ltd. cannot be considered independent of the object of the issue
discussed above. A clear nexus is established between the object of retaining
controlling interest and the preferential issue of shares.
37\. When the shares were acquired by the appellant-companies with the
specific objective of retaining the controlling interest in DRL, there cannot
be a presumption that those shares were acquired for resale in the stock
market and earn profit out of that if a person acquires a large block of
shares with the object of the acquisition of the controlling interest of the
company whose shares are to be purchased, the inference is inevitable that the
intention was not to acquire them as part of the persons stock-in-trade.
Subsequent disposal of some of the shares so acquired does not make the
transaction an adventure in the nature of trade. This was the view of the
Honble Supreme Court in the case of Ramnarain Sons (P) Ltd. (supra).

Where sale of those shares was not contemplated, there is no justification in
comparing the market price of existing DRL shares with the preferential issue
price of shares. One of the strongest arguments of the revenue is that the
appellant companies have derived the benefit through the preferential issue of
shares of DRL, as the issue was not made available to the public at large. The
main objective of preferential issue was to maintain the group control, even
after the Euro-issue. That is why the shares were allotted to the promoters
and their core associates. If shares were also offered to the public at large
as argued by the revenue, the very purpose of the preferential issue would be
defeated.
38\. As the preferential issue was made with a specific purpose, there was no
contemplation of any immediate sale of shares. This is the factual aspect.
Legally also, the appellant-companies could not sell those shares before the
expiry of a lock-in-period of three years. One of the mandatory conditions of
preferential issue of shares was a compulsory lock-in period of three years,
and as a matter of fact, that lot of shares allotted through preferential
issue was not quoted in the stock-market, as it could not be.

not have offered the shares to public at large. That would defeat the purpose
itself. The shares cannot be quoted in the market because of the compulsory
lock-in-period of three years. Therefore, those shares were not quoted in the
market. In the circumstances, those shares that could not be quoted in the
market, cannot be a subject matter of comparison with the existing shares
already quoted and traded in the stock market. There is no basis or
justification in making a comparison between unequals. Such a comparison is
hypothetical.

40\. The appellant-companies had no plan to procure shares from the stock
market. Therefore, the market price did not apply it was a preferential
allotment lawfully made. It was made for some strategical purpose of ownership
and control. The new shares were locked up for a period of three years. It was
not possible to sell the shares during the relevant previous year. The
premises relied on by the revenue pre-suppose the arising of benefit in the
nature of income on the principle of contemplated sale. The shares could be
sold only after three years. The share value is highly susceptible to market
fluctuations. We have already noted from the share valuation report that the
shares of DRL have fluctuated from Rs. 62.50 to Rs. 560 per share during the
23 month period ending May, 1994. In the circumstances, one cannot safely
predict what would be the market price of DRLs shares after the expiry of
three years. The market value depends on a lot of factors including general
economic conditions, market buoyancy, the status of particular industry and
the financial image of the particular company, etc. The appellant-companies
would gain benefit on the sale of shares only if at that time the shares
commanded a market price higher than the acquisition cost. To be simple, that
part of the matter is uncertain. The prospective benefit that might arise on
the sale of shares in the future is uncertain.

41\. The uncertain future benefit is the eventual capital gain that the
appellant-companies may obtain on the sale of shares. Whether such a
prospective income/gain could be construed as benefit taxable under section
28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961? In Sir Kikabhai Premchand v. CIT (1953) 24
ITR 506 (SC), the Honble Supreme Court has held that state has no power to tax
any potential future advantage. The observation in the above case that regard
must be had to the substance of transaction rather than to its mere form was
later disapproved by the Honble Apex Court in CIT v. B.M. Kharwar (1969) 72
ITR 603. But, the basic principle declared in Smt. Kikabhai Premchands case
(supra) that there could not be any levy of tax on a future income, still
holds good. The court of appeal in Mason (Inspector of Taxes) v. Innes (1968)
70 ITR 491 has pronounced the same basic, elementary principle of Income-tax
Law that a man could not be taxed on profit that he might have, but had not
made. If Masons case (supra) was decided in this country, the decision would
be the same as that of court of appeals, for the principle of leaving out of
assessment any potential advantage, benefit or gain was firstly established by
the Honble Supreme Court in Smt. Kikabhai Premchands case (supra).

42\. The above principle is in no way overlooked in the provisions contained
in section 28 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For the purpose of our discussion,
the relevant portion of section 28 is quoted below :
42\. The above principle is in no way overlooked in the provisions contained
in section 28 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For the purpose of our discussion,
the relevant portion of section 28 is quoted below :
"28. The following income shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head
"profits and gains of business or profession* *** *** *** *** *** ***
(iv) the value of any benefit or perquisite, whether convertible into money or
not, arising from business or the exercise of a profession......... "
(Emphasis, here italicised in print supplied) The statute has listed about six
items of income chargeable to tax under section 28. The opening words are "The
following income shall be...". The words are not "The following items shall
be...". The word income, is very important and purposeful. All the six
different items should satisfy the character of income so as to be taxed under
section 28. Those six items as such are not sufficient; every one of them
should be in the nature of income. The income, obviously need to be real.
Clause (iv), if edited for our purpose reads as follows : "The value of any
benefit arising from business ..................". That is, the benefit must
be one arising from business during the relevant previous year. While defining
the scope of total income in section 5 of the Act, the law has made a two-fold
characterisation, viz. income accruing or arising. But while dealing with
benefit in the nature of income in the context of section 28, law has
conspicuously omitted the concept of "accruing" and has prescribed only
"arising". "Benefit arising" implies benefit arising in the previous year. In
other words, the law has made the nature of benefit under section 28(iv) very
clear and precise. That is, the benefit must be income in character; and it
should be arising in the relevant previous year. In the present case, the
income is prospective on the condition of the future sale of shares. That
income which is prospective in nature cannot be construed as "benefit arising"
to the appellant-companies in the relevant previous year.
43\. The basis of the argument that the appellant-companies have derived
benefit in the preferential allotment of shares in the sense that the
companies have not paid Rs. 455 per share, but paid only Rs. 90 per share, and
thus the appellant-companies had a comparative price advantage, is again not
well-founded. The Honble High Court of Gujarat had an occasion to examine an
issue on the similar line in Spunpipe & Construction Co. Ltd.s case (supra).
Justice P.N. Bhagwati, as then he was, speaking for the Bench held as follows
:

well-founded. The Honble High Court of Gujarat had an occasion to examine an
issue on the similar line in Spunpipe & Construction Co. Ltd.s case (supra).
Justice P.N. Bhagwati, as then he was, speaking for the Bench held as follows
:
"Where a going concern including fixed assets and stock in trade is purchased,
the difference between the book value of any part of the assets acquired by
the assessee and the price paid by the assessee for the same cannot be
regarded as revenue profit derived by the assessee. No profit at all is made
by the assessee from the purchase of any of the assets. At the highest, what
can be said is that assets worth a particular amount are purchased by the
assessee for a smaller amount, but that does not represent the profit of the
assessee."
In view of the ratio laid down in the above judgment, it is very difficult to
hold that the savings in the acquisition cost of shares on a comparative price
advantage is in the nature of benefit contemplated in section 28(iv) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961.
44\. On the basis of our discussion of the issue in paras 33 to 45 above, we
have come to the following findings
44\. On the basis of our discussion of the issue in paras 33 to 45 above, we
have come to the following findings
(i) That the alleged benefit is a comparative benefit. It is an advantage,
relative in nature.Paras 33 to 35.
(ii) That there is no justification or sustainable basis for a comparison
between issue price and market price. Such a comparison would only be
hypothetical.Paras 34 to 40.
(iii) That the benefit the appellant-companies might derive would be an
eventual capital gain on the sale of shares after the lock-in-period of three
years. That prospective benefit is again uncertain.Para 41.
(iv) That the benefit should be in the nature of income arising in the
relevant previous year; it should be real income in the present and not a
prospective income of future.Paras 42 to 45.
(v) In fact the market price is applicable only to those shares quoted and
traded in the market. It is not applicable to those shares that could not be
quoted and traded in the market. For such shares, the correct method of
valuation is break-up value method. In the present case, the break-up value
and the preferential issue price at Rs. 90 per share are cross-matching. In
between them, there is no price difference, and therefore, there is no benefit
either.
45\. In view of the above findings, we are of the considered opinion that the
benefit contemplated by the assessing officer on the basis of the comparative
price differential between the preferential issue price and the market price
of DRL shares cannot be construed as "benefit", much less a "benefit in the
nature of income" arising to the appellant-companies from business during the
previous year relevant to the impugned assessment year 1995-96. As far as the
relevant previous year is concerned, the benefit or advantage was only
conceptual in nature as the real advantage or benefit would be in the nature
of eventual capital gain to be derived on the sale of those preferentially
allotted shares on a future date which would be beyond the close of the
relevant previous year. Therefore, the additions made by the assessing officer
in the assessments of the appellant-companies under section 28(iv) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 are not sustainable in law. The addition of Rs.
32,85,00,000 made in the case of M/s KNB Investments (P) Ltd. and the addition
of Rs. 29,70,73,500 made in the case of M/s. KAR Investments (P) Ltd. are
accordingly deleted.

holding that there was no benefit arising to the appellant-companies in the
preferential allotment of shares of DRL, it is found not necessary further to
decide on the other circumstances necessary to attract the provisions of
section 28(iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Therefore, the remaining grounds
are not considered as it would be academic in nature.

of Rs. 32,85,00,000 in the case of the former and Rs. 29,70,73,500 in the case
of the latter and determined a total and taxable income of Rs. 33,00,73,540
