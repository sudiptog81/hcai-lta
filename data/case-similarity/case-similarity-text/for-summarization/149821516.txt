PER SMT BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER Present appeal has been filed by
assessee against final assessment order dated 30/09/11 passed by Ld. DCIT,
Circle 12 (4), Bangalore under section 143 (3) read with 144C of the Act, for
assessment year 2006-07 on following grounds of appeal:
> The grounds stated hereunder are independent of, and without prejudice to
> one another. The Appellant submits as under:
> IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  2
> 1.Assessment and reference to Transfer Pricing Officer are bad in law
> a) The final assessment order issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Income-
> tax, Circle 12(4),DCIT' or 'AO
> b) is bad on facts and in law, and is in violation of the principles of
> natural justice.
Without prejudice to the above, the order issued by the AO is bad in law
insofar as the fact that the AO did not issue to Telelogic India Private
Limited (`the Appellant or 'the Company'), a show cause notice, as per proviso
to section 92C(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ['the Act'].
c) The AO has erred in law in making a reference to the Deputy Commissioner of
Income Tax - Transfer Pricing - V [`TP0'], inter alia, since he has not
recorded an opinion that any of the conditions in section 92C(3) of the Act,
were satisfied in the instant case. The AO also erred in not following the
provision contained in section 92CA (1) of the Act.
2.The fresh comparable search undertaken by the TPO is bad in law.
a) The AO/TPO erred on facts and in law in conducting fresh benchmarking
analysis using non contemporaneous data and substituting the Appellant's
analysis with fresh benchmarking analysis on his own conjectures and surmises.
Thus the Appellant prays that the fresh benchmarking analysis conducted by the
learned TPO is liable to be quashed.
b) On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
TPO erred in not demonstrating that the motive of the Appellant was to shift
profits outside of India by manipulating the prices charged in its
international transactions which are a pre- requisite condition to make any
adjustment under the provision of Chapter X of the Act.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  3
3\. Comparability analysis adopted by the TPO/AO for determination of arm's
length price.
a) The AO/TPO grossly erred on facts in benchmarking the transactions of the
captive software services of the Appellant with companies operating as full-
fledged entrepreneurs without considering the differences in the functions
performed, assets employed and risk undertaken by the Appellant vis-a-vis
comparable companies.
b)The AO/TPO erred on facts in rejecting the comparable companies arrived at
in the Transfer Pricing Study without considering the functional and risk
analysis of the Appellant.
c) The AO/TPO erred in law in applying arbitrary filters to arrive at a fresh
set of companies as comparables to the Appellant, without establishing
functional comparability.
d) The AO/TPO also erred on facts in arbitrarily accepting companies without
considering the turnover and size of the Appellant and comparables.
e) The AO/TPO grossly erred in law in deviating from the uncontrolled party
transaction definition as per the Income-tax Rules and arbitrarily applying a
25% related party criteria in accepting / rejecting comparables.
f) The AO/TPO also erred on facts and in law in arbitrarily rejecting
companies with different year ending (i.e. other than 31 March 2007) and
inconsistently applying such filter.
g) The AO/TPO grossly erred on facts in arbitrarily rejecting companies having
IT and ITeS revenues less than 75% of total operating revenue and
inconsistently applying such filters, without considering the specific
segmental results.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  4
h) The AO/TPO erred on facts in arbitrarily rejecting companies having onsite
revenues more than 75% of the export turnover, with respect to the
comparability analysis for IT segment.
i) The AO/ TPO erred in rejecting companies having employee cost less than 25%
of total sales, with respect to the comparability analysis for IT segment.

their financial results without considering the functional comparability.
k) The AO/TPO erred on facts and in law in considering a set, of 'secret
data', i.e. data which was not available in public domain, in arriving at a
fresh set of companies using his power under section 133(6), which is grossly
unjustified.
l) The AO/TPO also erred on facts and in law in excluding the foreign exchange
gain or loss while calculating the net margins of the comparable companies.
4\. Erroneous data used by the AO/TPO
a) The AO/TPO has erred in law in using data, which was not contemporaneous
and which was not available in the public domain at the time of conducting the
transfer pricing study by the Appellant.

computing the margin of alleged comparable companies as such data had an
influence in determining the pricing policy of the Appellant.

research and development expenditure and (d) risk profile between the

c)On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the learned AO has erred
in treating the asset insurance expenses of Rs 73,800 as incurred for delivery
of computer software outside India inspite of clear directions of the Hon'ble

the case, the learned AO has erred in reducing the foreign travel & other
expenses amounting to Rs. 3,608,208; telecommunication expenses amounting to

turnover without correspondingly reducing the said expenses from the total

It has been submitted that Ld.TPO denied working capital adjustment, as
assessee did not provide segment wise breakup of creditors debtors etc., and
also excluded foreign exchange gain/loss from operating revenue.
He thus proposed adjustment of Rs.1,46,97,412/-.
4\. Aggrieved by proposed adjustment, assessee filed objection before DRP. DRP
after dealing with objection raised by assessee, upheld comparables selected
by Ld.TPO, however granted working capital adjustment under both segments, if
details are provided by assessee. Under ITES segment DRP did not direct for
adjustment on depreciation.
4.1 Upon receipt of DRP directions, assessing officer passed final assessment
order by making an addition in the hands of assessee as under:

Ld.AR further submitted that assessing officer while passing final assessment
order did not granted working capital adjustment even after the directions of
DRP. He submitted that all relevant details required, was furnished by
assessee before Ld.AO as per directions of DRP.
5\. Aggrieved by additions made by Ld.AO, assessee is in appeal before us now.
5.1 Assessee has raised following additional ground on 15/11/16.
d) PRAYER FOR ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS OF APPEAL
1\. The above referred appeal is in respect of the order passed by the learned
Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 12(4) (`Assessing Officer' {'AO']).
The Assessing Officer had passed Draft Assessment Order against which the
Appellant IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  15 had filed objection before the Dispute
Resolution Panel (`DRP'). The DRP dismissed the objections and confirmed the
draft assessment order. Pursuant to the final assessment order issued by the
learned AO under section 143(3) r.w.s. 144C, the Appellant is in appeal before
the Hon'ble Bench.
2\. In the final assessment order issued under section 143(3) r.w.s. 144C,
transfer pricing additions were made for transactions with associated
enterprises along with certain other additions to the total income of the
Appellant.
3\. The additional grounds of appeal (enclosed herewith) relates to rejection
of Helios & Matheson Information Technology Limited, Infosys Technologies
Limited, Kals Information Systems Limited, Sasken Communication Technologies
Limited, Tata Elxsi Limited and Wipro Limited as comparables for the software
development services rendered by the Appellant.
4\. The additional grounds of appeal (enclosed herewith) relates to rejection
of Cosmic Global Limited, Maple E- solutions Limited, Spanco Limited, Triton
Corporation Limited and Wipro Limited as comparables for the Information
Technology enabled services (`IT Enabled services') rendered by the Appellant.
The Appellant had selected these companies as comparables in its Transfer
Pricing study. The TPO has also selected these companies as comparables in the
order passed u/s 92CA. The Appellant had raised objection before lower
authorities against inclusion of these companies in the list of comparables.
With respect to rejection of a comparable, the ground pertains to question of
law and facts. The Appellant submits that it is not estopped from rejecting
companies selected as IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  16 comparables in the Transfer
Pricing study based on facts available in the public domain. The Appellant
humbly prays that the additional ground be admitted and adjudicated along with
the other grounds of appeal in the course of hearing of the appeal.
It has been submitted that assessee missed to allege certain comparables under
software development service segment and ITES segment for exclusion, while
filing the appeal before this Tribunal. It has been submitted that these
comparables were agitated before DRP however DRP failed to appreciate
contentions raised by assessee.
Placing reliance upon decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of NTPC Ltd vs
CIT reported in 229 ITR 383 and Jute Corporation of India vs CIT reported in
53 taxman 85, submitted that comparables specified in additional grounds may
be admitted. Ld.CIT DR, though opposed admission of additional ground, could
not controvert submissions advance by Ld.AR.
6\. We have perused details relied upon by both sides In our considered
opinion the comparables alleged in additional ground arises out of the records
and was objected before DRP for its exclusion/inclusion. Considering
inadvertent mistake on behalf of assessee in raising these grounds before this
Tribunal, we allow additional ground raised now.
Accordingly additional grounds raised by assessee vide application dated
5/11/2016 stands allowed. It has been submitted that all Transfer Pricing
issues raised in Ground No. 1-6 are in respect of inappropriate comparables
included by Ld.TPO, and rejecting certain comparables which were IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  17 functionally similar to that of assessee. Ld.AR alleged by
way of chart, exclusion of certain comparables under both segments, which are
as follows:
7\. ITES segment:
Ld.AR submitted that following comparables are either to be excluded for
failing in RPT filter less than 15% or having high turnover more than 200
crores:
 Apollo Healthstreet Ltd  Asit C Mehta Financial Services Ltd  Informed
Technologies Ltd  HCL Comnet Systems and Services Ltd  Infosys BPO Ltd 
Wipro Ltd.
He submitted that other comparables alleged for exclusion, which are
functionally not similar with that of assessee are as under:  Accentia
Technologies Ltd.,  Accurate Data Converters Ltd  Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.,
 Calibre Business Solutions Ltd  Eclerx services Ltd  I Services India Pvt.
Ltd.,  Maple Evolution Ltd  Mould-Tech Technologies Ltd (segmental)  Spanco
Ltd  Triton Corpn. Ltd  Vishal Information Technologies Ltd IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  18 Before we analyse these comparables it is sine qua non to
understand functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by assessee
under this segment.
Functions:
In TP study, assessee has been set to be providing global support
business/tele-calling/global, consultancy services to the group companies and
also provides after sales services and training. Telelogic India performs all
routine functions required to render these services to Telelogic Group of
companies. Assets employed:
It has been submitted that assessee does not own any intangible assets and has
got routine assets as listed in the balance sheet for the year ending.
Risks Assumed:
Under ITES service segment, assessee is said to be risk mitigated as the group
companies compensate assessee for the cost incurred in providing the services,
except for foreign exchange risk as the invoice is raised by assessee in
foreign currency and employee hiring and retention risk as assessee is
responsible for the recruitment and retention of personal in its organisation.
Based upon the above we shall now undertake compatibility of alleged
comparables for exclusion by assessee.
8\. Apollo Healthstreet Ltd., Asit C Mehta Financial Services Ltd., and
Informed Technologies Ltd.
It has been submitted by Ld.AR that, these comparables fail RPT filter, being
less than 15%. In support of his contention placed reliance on following
decisions of this Tribunal:
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  19  M/s Poll to Win India Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT reported
in IT(TP)A No. 1053/Bang/2011;
 M/s Tesco Hindustan Services Centers Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT in ITA No.
1285/Bang/2011;
 M/s Magma Design Automation India Pvt.Ltd. vs ACIT in ITA No.1241/Bang/2011;
 First Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT in ITA No.
1086/Bang/2011;
On the contrary, Ld.CIT DR relying upon Rule 10 B (4) of Income tax Rules,
submitted that in;
 Microelectronics Ltd., reported in 87 Taxmann.com 262;  Triology E-business
Software, reported in 29 Taxmann.com  310  Sendute India Ltd., In ITA (TP) A
59/Bang/2016 vide order dated 07/07/17;
this Tribunal held that, merely because in decisions passed by this Tribunal
in various cases, excludes certain comparables alleged by assessee, does not
mean that it is excludable in present case too.
9\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us.
9.1 On perusal of order passed by Ld.TPO it is observed that filter applied in
respect of related party transaction was 25%. Before DRP assessee objected
application of this filter. Assessee now placing reliance upon various
decisions of this Tribunal contends that RPT filter must be restricted to 15%
and thereby alleges exclusion of Apollo Healthstreet Ltd., Asit C Mehta
Financial Services Ltd., and Informed Technologies Ltd. As per present
position of law, RPT filter should be applied is at 15%. We therefore IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  20 set aside order of Ld.AO/TPO and restore back the issue to
file of Ld.AO/TPO for fresh decision by applying RPT filter of 15% We
accordingly set aside Apollo Healthstreet Ltd., Asit C Mehta Financial
Services Ltd., and Informed Technologies Ltd.back to Ld. AO/TPO.
10\. HCL Comnet Systems and Services Ltd., Infosys BPO Ltd., and Wipro Ltd.
Ld.AR submitted that these comparables fails in turnover filter of 1 to 200
Crores. It has been submitted that companies having turnover of more than 200
Crores have to be eliminated from list of comparables as laid down in several
decisions referred to by Ld.AR:  Genisys Integrating Systems (India) (P.)
Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 20 taxmann.com 715(Bang-Trib)  CIT v. Pentair Water
India (P.) Ltd. [2016] 69 taxmann.com 180 (Bom)  Commissioner of Income-tax
v. Agnity India Technologies (P.) Ltd (2013) 36 taxmann.com 289(Delhi) It is
submitted that HCL Comnet Systems and Services Ltd., Infosys BPO Ltd., and
Wipro Ltd., have high turnover of more than 200 crore, and therefore, cannot
be compared with assessee which is captive service provider. Ld.AR submitted
that, assessee's turnover was Rs.8.6 Crore.He submitted that Ld.TPO had
applied lower turnover filter and excluded companies whose turnover was less
than Rs.1 Crore. Further assessee contentded, before DRP that while Ld.TPO
excluded companies with low turnover, he failed to apply same yardstick to
exclude companies with high turnover. He submitted that reasons given by
authorities below for exclusion of companies with low turnover was that, such
companies do not IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  21 reflect industry trends, as their
low cost to sales ratio made their results unreliable. Contention of assessee
was that there would be effect on profitability whenever there is high or low
turnover and therefore companies with high turnover should also be excluded
from the list of comparable companies. DRP rejected assessee's contentions
without assigning any reason. Ld.AR placed reliance on decision of co-ordinate
bench of this Tribunal in the case of Genisys Integrating Systems (India) (P.)
Ltd. (supra), wherein it was held that when there is a limit for the lower end
for identifying the comparable companies, there is no reason why there should
not be an upper turnover limit also, as size matters in business. Ld.AR
submitted that co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Dell
International Services India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in [2018] 89
taxmann.com 44 for Assessment Year 2005-06 considered various aspects of
application of turnover filter for excluding companies and observed that first
decision rendered on application of this filter was in case of Genisys
Integrating Systems (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra). Further, in case of Dell
International Services India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), co-ordinate bench of this
Tribunal discussed apparent divergent view of two non-jurisdictional High
Courts and also decision of this Tribunal in the case of Sysarris Software
(P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in [2016] 67 taxmann.com 243 (Bang. - Trib.),
wherein, Tribunal, after noticing decision of Hon'ble High Delhi Court in case
of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in
[2015] 56 taxmann.com 417 and decision to the contrary by Hon'ble Bombay High
Court in case of CIT v. Pentair Water India (P.) Ltd. reported in [2016] 69
taxmann.com 180 held that, since there were contrary views on the IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  22 issue, therefore view favourable to assessee laid down in
case of Pentair Water India (P) Ltd. (supra) should be adopted. The Ld.CIT DR
submitted that turnover is not a relevant criteria to regard a company as not
comparable, so long the two companies are functionally comparable.
11\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. We have also referred to the decisions relied upon by both
sides.
It has been held in various decisions by this Tribunal that turnover filter is
a relevant filter. This Tribunal in case of Genesis Integrating Systems India
Pvt. Ltd., vs DCIT reported in (2012) 20 taxman.com
715\. In facts of present case, assessee has been set to be providing global
support business/tele-calling/global, consultancy services to group companies
and also provides after sales services and training.
11.1 It is observed that comparables sought to be excluded are 100 % Software
Development Companies, having high turnover, and therefore respectfully
following aforestated view in case of Genesis Integrating Systems India Pvt.
Ltd., vs DCIT (supra), these comparables are to be excluded because they have
high turnover of more than 200 crore. It is submitted that subsequently this
Tribunal in case of Yodlee Infotech Pvt. Ltd vs ITO in IT(TP)A no.
108/Bang/2014 For assessment year 2009-10, vide order dated 12/12/14, excluded
these companies following Genesis Integrating systems Indi Pvt.Ltd
vs.DCIT(supra).
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  23 Reliance has been placed on decision of this
Tribunal in case of Autodesk India Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT reported in (2018) 96
Taxmann.com 263 followed similar view to exclude identical comparables by
applying turnover filter, wherein all the decisions relied upon by Ld. CIT DR
has been considered and dealt with.
Therefore, respectfully following above decisions, we direct Ld.TPO to exclude
HCL Comnet Systems and Services Ltd., Infosys BPO Ltd., and Wipro Ltd., from
final list as they fail turnover filter of 1- 200 crores.
12\. Now coming to comparables alleged to be functionally not similar with
assessee. We shall analyse each of them, having regards to annual reports of
comparables placed before us.
a) Accentia Technologies Ltd., This company has been selected by Ld.TPO into
the list of comparables. Ld.Counsel submitted that during the year under
consideration Geo-Soft Technologies (Trivandrum) Ltd. and Iridium Technologies
India Pvt. Ltd amalgamated with Accentia resulting in abnormal rise in
profits. It has been submitted that Delhi benches in case of Ciena India
Pvt.Ltd vs. DCIT reported in (2015) 57 Taxmann.com 329 and ICC India Pvt.Ltd
versus DCIT reported in (2016) 71 Taxmann.com 164 as well as Mumbai bench in
Petro Araldite Pvt.Ltd vs DCIT reported in 31 Taxmann.com 281, has held that a
company cannot be considered as comparable because of financial results become
distorted due to mergers, demergers etc. It has been submitted that similar
view has also been taken by Delhi bench in case of Toluna India Pvt.Ltd vs.
ACIT reported in (2014) 50 Taxmann.com 24. Due to the amalgamation of
companies into IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  24 Accentia during the year in
question it may not be comparable with assessee.
Ld.DR on the contrary submitted that annual report does not specify any
amalgamation and therefore the financials cannot be considered to be
distorted. This company is into medical transcription and is perfectly
comparable with that of assessee being a BPO.
We have perused the submissions advanced by both the sides in the light of the
records placed before us. From the audited statements of this company placed
at page 286-335 of paper book volume 2, it is clear that assessee has acquired
51% stake in Geo- Soft Technologies (Trivandrum) Ltd. and 51% stake in Iridium
Technologies India Pvt. Ltd. It is observed that almost approximately 68% of
operating cost is towards overseas business expenses as against 'nil' in case
of assessee and hence there is a difference in business model. Further
substantial marketing expenses to an extent of approximately 28% of sales as
against 'nil' of assessee have been undertaken by this company. Under such
circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that this company is not
functionally similar as well as the risk profile is quite different from that
of assessee and accordingly cannot be considered to be a fit comparable.
We direct this company to be excluded from the list of comparables.
b) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., Eclerx Services Ltd., and Mold- Tek Technologies
Ltd., It has been submitted by Ld.AR that, Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., Eclerx
Services Ltd., and Mold-Tek Technologies Ltd., were IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011
25 excluded from list of comparables by this Tribunal in case of First
Advantage Offshore Services (P.) Ltd. (supra) for functional dissimilarity.
This Tribunal observed that these companies are into business of Knowledge
Process Outsourcing (KPO)and thus held these companies un comparable with an
assessee which is engaged in IT enabled services. Relevant paragraphs of order
of Tribunal in case of First Advantage Offshore Services (P.) Ltd. (supra) are
extracted hereunder:
"39, Having heard both the parties and having considered their rival
contentions, we find that the assessee had raised elaborate objections to each
of the comparables in group 3 before the TPQ, The TPO has also reproduced the
said objections in his order para 6.5.1. of page 178 of his order. He has
rejected the contention of the assessee by holding that every function within
BPO sector can be from low end to high end and the activities of the assessee
such as accounting, web management, network management are BPO services using
technology but these services are not categorized as KPO. He held that a call
centre may offer support services, like telemarketing to high end services
like technical support services, where not only the level of knowledge, skill
required would be high, but the technical knowledge as well would be high.
According to him, back office transaction process services may he as
remarkable and as complicated as insurance/market transaction processing
services. He, therefore, rejected the contention of the assessee and treated
the 131 'O as equivalent to KPO services.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  26
40\. We have to now consider whether a BPO and a KPO are functionally similar
and are comparable to each, other. BPO is a subset if, outscoring arid
involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of specific
business functions or process to a third party services provider. Often
business processes outsourcing are information technology based and referred
to as ITES-BPO, KPO is one of the sub-segment of the BPO industry. It involves
outsourcing of core information related business activities which are
competitively important or form an integral part of a company's value chain.
It thus requires advanced analytical and technical skills as well as a high
degree of specialist expertise, The KPO services include all kinds of research
and information gathering. Thus it can be seen that even though both BPO and
KPO are offering information technology based services/ the skill and
expertise and may be even the tools required are different which may result in
different economic results of both the segments. Thus, in such circumstances,
we are of the opinion that they cannot be compared with each other and have to
be excluded from the list of comparables. "
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions Ltd. v. CIT [2015]
234 Taxman 573 held that KPO company cannot be compared with BPO company.
Ld.CIT DR has not controverted that these companies are KPO companies and that
assessee before us is a captive service provider low end BPO functions to
support AE.
At this juncture Ld.DR placed reliance upon decision of Microgenetic Ltd
reported in 87 taxman.com 262, Triology e-
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  27 Business Software reported in 29 Taxmann.com 310,
wherein it has been observed that, merely because that certain decisions of
this Tribunal excluded certain comparables, does not ipso facto mean, such
comparables should be excluded without analysing functional
similarities/dissimilarities with that of assessee in present case. In support
of his argument Ld.CIT DR referred to decision of this Tribunal in Sendute
India Pvt.Ltd in IT (TP) A 59/B/2016 vide order dated 07/07/17.
c) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.
This comparable has been included by ld.TPO in the list of comparables.
Ld.Cunsel submitted that this company is functionally not similar, as it is
into software development and data cleaning segment vis-a-vis captive service
provider like assessee. It has been submitted that ld.TPO considered data
cleaning segment as ITES, only on the basis of companies reply under 133 (6)
of the Act. However on perusal of the reply it is very clear that company
provides cleansing services only to those clients for whom it had developed
software applications. Thus Ld. counsel submitted that cleansing services
rendered by this company is ancillary to software development services
provided to those clients to whom it had provided the software applications.
On the contrary ld. DR placed reliance upon the order of ld. TPO. We have
perused submissions advanced by both sides and observed that it is into
software development and data cleansing segment. It has been categorised to
have only one segment being software development and is engaged in providing
open and end- to-end web solutions, software consultancy, design and
development of solutions using the latest technologies.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  28 We therefore do not find this company to be
comparable with that of assessee and direct Ld.TPO to exclude this from list
of comparables.
d).Eclerx services Ltd., This comparable was included by Ld.TPO, as it is
providing knowledge-based specialised services. It has been submitted by
Ld.Counsel that Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions
Pvt. Ltd., vs. CIT reported in (2015) 377 ITR 533 has held that KPO segment
cannot be compared with ITES segment. Hon'ble Court has held Eclerx to be a
KPO, whereas present assessee is a captive service provider.
Ld.DR submitted that functions performed by assessee is also KPO and therefore
is a fit comparable.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records placed
before us.
It is observed this company is engaged in providing high-level services
involving specialised knowledge and domain expertise and is a leading provider
of KPO services, whereas assessee is a captive service provider which provides
services only to its group concerns on the requirement as per the contract. It
has been submitted that Delhi Bench of the ITAT in iQor India Services (P.)
Ltd v. ITO [2015] 57 taxmann.com 416/69 SOT 37 (URO) held as under:--
'Eclerx Services Ltd.
Eclerx is engaged in providing data analytics services with expertise in
financial service and retail and manufacturing. The service provided by the
company are high end in nature involving special knowledge and domain
expertise and therefore, not functionally comparable with the assessee company
which is engaged in providing low end ITES enabled call centre services to its
AE. The fact Eclerx Services Ltd. is providing high end services IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  29 involving special knowledge and domain expertise is
evident from the company's own reply to the notice u/s 133(6) which is placed
at pages 976 to 979 of the paper book filed by the assessee. The Hon'ble
Special Bench of the Tribunal in case of Maersk Global Centre (India) (P.)
Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT [2014] 147 ITD 83/43 taxmann.com 100 (Mum.) had excluded
Eclerx Services Pvt. Ltd. from the list of comparables for the reason that it
is providing high end services involving specialised knowledge and domain
expertise and same cannot be compared with companies which are mainly engaged
in providing low end services to group companies.
The relevant finding of the Hon'ble Tribunal read as follows :-- "In so far as
M/s eClerx Services Limited is concerned, the relevant information is
available in the form of annual report for financial year 2007- 08 placed at
page 166 to 183 of the paper book. A perusal of the same shows that the said
company provides data analytics and data process solutions to some of the
largest brands in the world and is recognized as experts in chosen markets-
financial services and retail and manufacturing. It is claimed to be providing
complete business solutions by combining people, process improvement and
automation. It is claimed to have employed over 1500 domain specialists
working for the clients. It is claimed that eClerx is a different company with
industry specialized services for meeting complex client needs, data analytics
KPO service provider specializing in two business verticals - financial
services and retail and manufacturing. It is claimed to be engaged in
providing solutions that do not just reduce cost, but help the clients
increase sales and reduce risk by enhancing efficiencies and by providing
valuable insights that empower better decisions. M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd.
is also claimed to have a scalable delivery model and solutions offered that
include data analytics, operations management, audits and reconciliation,
metrics management and reporting services. It also provides tailored process
outsourcing and management services along with a multitude of data
aggregation, mining and maintenance services. It is claimed that the company
has a team dedicated to developing automation tools to support service
delivery. These software automation tools increase productivity, allowing
customers to benefit from further cost saving and output gains with better
control over quality. Keeping in view the nature of IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011
30 services rendered by M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. and its functional
profile, we are of the view that this company is also mainly engaged in
providing high-end services involving specialized knowledge and domain
expertise in the field and the same cannot be compared with the assessee
company which is mainly engaged in providing low-end services to the group
concerns.
For the reasons given above, we are of the view that if the functions actually
performed by the assessee company for its AEs are compared with the functional
profile of M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. and Mold-Tek Technologies Ltd., it is
difficult to find out any relatively equal degree of comparability and the
said entities cannot be taken as comparables for the purpose of determining
ALP of the transactions of the assessee company with its AEs. We, therefore,
direct that these two entities be excluded from the list of 10 comparables
finally taken by the AO/TPO as per the direction of the DRP."' The above
ruling of Special Bench is equally applicable to facts of assessee, as is
evident from functional profile of assessee.
For aforesaid reasons, we direct Eclerx Services Ltd. be excluded from final
list of comparables.
e) Mold- Tek Technologies Ltd (Seg) This company has been included by ld.TPO.
However Ld.Counsel submits that it is pioneer in structural engineering
services and provides highly technical and specialised engineering services by
use of information technology which is incidental. Further it has been
submitted that there are no segmental information regarding this comparable
and has relied upon decision of Delhi Tribunal in the case of ICC India
Pvt.Ltd., vs. ACIT (supra). Ld.DR placed reliance upon order of ld.TPO. We
have perused submissions advanced by both the sides in the light of records
placed before us. It is observed that this company is IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011
31 involved in providing structural engineering services to high-rise
buildings. It is observed that this company has undergone merger with Tools
Pvt. Ltd., and acquisition of Crossroads IMC USA. Post amalgamation accounts
of companies were revised for the financial year 2006-07 because of which this
company has underwent a huge change in business module. Delhi benches of this
Tribunal in Cienna India Pvt.Ltd reported in (2015) 57 taxman.com 329 as well
as Mumbai bench in Petro Araldite Pvt.Ltd reported in (2013) 31 taxman.com
281, held that a company cannot be considered as comparable because of
financial results becoming distorted due to mergers, demergers etc. Similar
view has been taken in case of Toluna India Pvt.Ltd reported in (2014) 50
Taxmann.com 24, and ICC India Pvt.Ltd versus DCIT reported in (2016) 71
taxman.com
164\. Respectfully following the same, we direct this comparable to be
excluded from the list of comparables.
f) Caliber Point Business Solutions Ltd., Regarding Caliber Pint Business
Solutions Ltd., co-ordinate bench (Mumbai) of Tribunal in case of Stream
International Services (P.) Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT reported in [2015] 53
taxmann.com 19 held:
" (x) Caliber Point Business Solutions Ltd.:- At the outset, the ld. Counsel
for the assessee stated that this company deserves to be rejected as the
related party transaction is more than 25% which is a filter adopted by the
TPO himself. We find that the DRP has not considered this objection because it
was of the opinion that related party transaction is mainly for reimbursements
and recoveries and therefore would not affect the company. We find IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  32 that an identical issue came up before the Tribunal in
assessee's own case in A.Y. 2006-07 in ITA No. 8997/Mum/2010 wherein the
Tribunal has rejected this contention of the Department. The Tribunal at para
13 of its order has observed that "A pure reimbursement of expenses by one AE
to another AE is very much a 'transaction' as per section 92F(v) and
consequently is equally an international transaction as per section 92B
requiring consideration as per section 92 of the Act". These observations were
in relation to a company namely Datamatics Financial Services Limited. We
therefore do not find any force in the rejection of the objection by the DRP
in line with the observations of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for A.Y.
2006-07. We direct for the exclusion of this company from the final set of
comparable.
Learned Standing Counsel has not brought anything controverting the findings
of the Tribunal in the above case. Therefore, we have no reason to differ with
the reasoning adopted by the co- ordinate bench in the case of Stream
International Services (P.) Ltd. (supra). Therefore, we direct the AO/TPO to
exclude this company form the list of comparables."
Even before us nothing contrary to the above findings has been brought on
record by revenue. Respectfully following the same, we therefore direct Ld.TPO
to exclude these comparables from final list.
g) Maple Esolutions Ltd and Triton Corporation Ltd Assessee seeks exclusion of
Maple Esolutions Ltd and Triton Corporation Ltd. on the ground that their
financial results are not IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  33 reliable. It has been
submitted that comparability of Maple E Solutions Ltd., and Triton Corporation
Ltd. came up for consideration before co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in
case of e4e Business Solutions India (P.) Ltd. (supra), wherein it has been
held:
"14. With regard to company at SI.Nos.19 & 23 of the list of comparable
companies chosen by the TPO viz., M/s. Maple E solutions Ltd., and Triton
Corporation Ltd., the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Stream
International Services (P.) Ltd., (supra) in para 13(iii) at page-14 of the
order held that the promoters of these two companies were involved in fraud
for earlier years and hence the financial results of these companies are
distorted and cannot be relied upon and in this regard relied on several
decisions rendered by the various benches of ITAT. Respectfully following the
same, we direct the aforesaid two companies be excluded from the list of
comparable companies chosen by the TPO."
Learned Standing Counsel has not brought anything controverting the findings
of the Tribunal in the above case. Therefore, we have no reason to differ with
the reasoning adopted by the co-ordinate bench in the case of e4e Business
Solutions India (P.) Ltd. (supra). Therefore, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude
these companies form the list of comparables.
Before us nothing contrary to the above findings has been brought on record by
revenue. Ld. DR do not have any objection in exclusion of this comparable.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  34 Respectfully following the same, we therefore
direct Ld.TPO to exclude these comparables from final list.
h) I Services India Pvt. Ltd, Assessee seeks exclusion of I Services India
Pvt. Ltd, on ground that complete data is not available. Reliance was placed
on decision in case of e4e Business Solutions India (P.) Ltd. (supra) wherein
it has been held:
"30. The assessee has not raised any specific ground on adopting this company
as a comparable before the DRP. Before us, the learned counsel for the
assessee has submitted that the TPO did not furnish the information obtained
from this company in exercise of his powers u/s. 133(6) of the Act. It was
further pointed out that even as per the TPO, the annual report of this
company for F. Y. 2006-07 was not available. The TPO has gone by the data
available on capita line data base. The learned counsel for the assessee
therefore made a prayer that the question of considering the aforesaid company
as a comparable should be remanded back to the TPO/Assessing Officer for fresh
consideration and the issue decided in the light of the published annual
report for F.Y. 2006-07 and also on the basis of the information furnished by
this company to the Assessing Officer in response to notice u/s. 133(6) of the
Act. We have considered the submissions and are of the view that the same
deserves to be accepted. The TPO/Assessing Officer will obtain the annual
report of the company for F.Y. 2006-07 and also furnish the assessee copies of
the same together with the information obtained by the TPO pursuant to issue
of notice u/s. 133(6) of the IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  35 Act. The assessee
will thereafter furnish its reply as to why this company should not be
considered as a comparable company. The TPO/Assessing Officer will thereafter
decide the question of considering this company as a comparable company after
affording opportunity of being heard to the assessee. "
Learned Standing Counsel has not brought anything controverting the findings
of the Tribunal in the above case. Therefore, we have no reason to differ with
the reasoning adopted by the co-ordinate bench in the case of e4e Business
Solutions India (P.) Ltd. (supra). Therefore, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude
these companies form the list of comparables."
Even before us nothing contrary to the above findings has been brought on
record by revenue. Respectfully following the same, we therefore direct Ld.TPO
to exclude these comparables from final list.
i) Vishal Information Technologies Ltd This comparable was selected by Ld.TPO.
Ld.Counsel submitted that this company is not similar in function, assets and
risk profile with that of assessee and it has a different business module.
Further it has been submitted that Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
Rampgreen Solutions Pvt Ltd., (supra) categorised this comparable to be a KPO
service provider. Further Ld.Counsel submitted that this entity outsources its
ITES services to third- party vendor thereby increasing operating expenses.
Ld. DR placed reliance upon the orders of authorities below. We have perused
the submissions advanced by both the sides in the light of the records placed
before us. It is observed that Hon'ble IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  36 Delhi High
Court in the case of Rampgreen Solutions Private Limited (supra) has
considered this to be a KPO service provider. In the facts of present assessee
before us, services are rendered to group concerns, strictly on the basis of
contract and requirement of its AE. And therefore this company cannot be
comparable with the functions performed by present assessee before us.
Accordingly we direct this company to be excluded from the list of
comparables.
j) Accurate Data Converters Ltd Assessee objected for exclusion of this
comparable for the reason that it is functionally with that of assessee and
financial data are not available in the database. It is also been submitted
that it this company fails employee cost filter applied by Ld. TPO. It has
been submitted that this comparable has reported employee cost at 1.61% which
shows a different business model. Ld.ARfurther submitted that this company
outsources its business and provides software development services.
On the other hand Ld. DR placed reliance upon orders of authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of records
placed before us.
Ld.AR placed reliance upon decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in
case of Siemens information processing services (P) Ltd vs DCIT reported in
(2016) 71 Taxmann.com 281, wherein this company was considered for
comparability analysis under ITES segment. It has been observed by the
tribunal that employee cost is at 1.61% and this company also outsources its
business to outside vendor is. It is also been observed by the tribunal
therein that in IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  37 information sought by Ld. TPO
under section 133 (6) it was found that this company provides software
development services. However before us Ld. TPO has not verified the functions
performed by this company. We are therefore inclined to set aside this
comparable to Ld.TPO for verification and to decide the comparability on the
basis of functional dissimilarities/similarities. Accordingly this comparable
is set aside to Ld.TPO.
k) Spanco Ltd., Assessee sought to exclude this comparable on the basis of
failure of revenue filter earned from ITES segment. It has been submitted that
this comparable earns only 8.21% from ITES segments and that the employee cost
of this company is as lower 7.16%. It has also been pointed out that this
comparable has underwent a demerger of the division during the year under
consideration. In support of his submission he placed reliance upon the
decision of coordinate bench of this Tribunal in case of Siemens information
processing services (P) Ltd vs DCIT(supra) and AOL online India private
limited reported in (2016) 68 Taxmann.com 235. Ld. DR on the contrary placed
reliance upon orders of authorities below.
We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the records
placed before us.
It is observed that coordinate bench of this tribunal in aforestated decisions
have set aside this issue for verification as regarding be employee cost of
7.16% and revenue earned under ITES segment at 8.21% with a direction to
exclude if the alleged fact is found to be correct. Respectfully following the
same we direct Ld. AO to verify IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  38 the same and to
consider the comparability of this company with assessee on the basis of
details verified. Accordingly this comparable is set aside to Ld.TPO.
13\. Software Service Segment In TP study placed at page 95-388 of paper book
volume 1, it is observed that, under software development service segment,
following are functions performed by assessee, assets employed and risk
assumed during the year:
a) Functions:
assessee provides software development services to Telelogic group companies.
It has been submitted that assessee is engaged in business of selling licenses
for use of software applications developed by its parent and group companies.
Under software development segment assessee renders services in the domain of
requirement management, business process management and enterprise
architecture. Global service agreement entered into by assessee with its AE
dated 15/02/06 placed at page 409 of paper book reveals that assessee under
software development service segment has to support its AE by developing,
testing, supporting, maintaining of internal Telelogic tools like
MOVEX,AXAPTA, TST etc. it has been submitted that assessee is remunerated on a
cost plus basis for its software development services and the cost incurred by
assessee is also compensated on any rework on deliverables.
b) Risks assumed from TP study it is observed that assessee do not bear any
contract risk, credit risk, market risk, quality risk. Only risk assumed by
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  39 assessee is in respect of foreign exchange
fluctuation risk as the invoicing is done in foreign currency and employee
risk as assessee is responsible for recruitment and retention of personal in
its organisation.
c) Assets employed: Assessee does not own any intangibles and possesses only
routine tangible assets required to perform its day- to-day affairs like
computers office spaces etc. In the TP study, assessee is thus categorised as
a captive service provider providing services only to Telelogic group
companies. On the basis of aforestated FAR analysis, we shall now undertake
comparability of comparables disputed by assessee for alleged reasons as
under:
A) Ld. AR submitted that following comparables are sought to be excluded on
turnover filter:
 Flextronics Software Systems Ltd  iGate Global Solutions Ltd  Infosys
Technologies  Mindtree Ltd  Persistent Systems Ltd  Sasken Communications
Technologies Ltd (seg.)  Tata Elxsi Ltd  Wipro Ltd (segmental) B) Ld.AR
submitted that Geometric Ltd (seg) is to be excluded as related party
transaction of this comparable is more than 15%.
C) Ld.AR submitted that assessee seeks to exclude following comparables on
functional dissimilarities:  Accel Transmatic Ltd., IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011
40  Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.,  Celestial Labs Ltd  KALS Information
Systems Ltd (seg.) A. Ld.AR submitted that these comparables fails in turnover
filter of 1 to 200 crores. It has been submitted that companies having
turnover of more than 200 crores have to be eliminated from the list of
comparables as laid down in several decisions referred to by ld. AR :
> Genisys Integrating Systems (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2012] 20
> taxmann.com 715(Bang-Trib) CIT v. Pentair Water India (P.) Ltd. [2016] 69
> taxmann.com 180 (Bom) Commissioner of Income-tax v. Agnity India
> Technologies (P.) Ltd (2013) 36 taxmann.com 289(Delhi) It is submitted that
> Flextronics Software Systems Ltd., iGate Global Solutions Ltd., Infosys
> Technologies., Mindtree Ltd.,Persistent Systems Ltd., Sasken Communications
> Technologies Ltd (seg.)., Tata Elxsi Ltd., Wipro Ltd (segmental) have high
> turnover of more than 200 crore, and therefore, cannot be compared with
> assessee which is captive service provider. Ld.AR submitted that, assessee's
> turnover under this segment is only14.13 crores. Ld.AR submitted that Ld.TPO
> applied lower turnover filter and excluded companies whose turnover was less
> than Rs.1 Crore. Further assessee's contented, before DRP that while Ld.TPO
> excluded companies with low turnover, he failed to apply same yardstick to
> exclude companies with high turnover. He submitted that reasons given by
> authorities below for exclusion of companies with low turnover was IT(TP)A
> No.1220(B)/2011  41 that, such companies do not reflect industry trends, as
> their low cost to sales ratio made their results unreliable. Contention of
> assessee was that there would be effect on profitability whenever there is
> high or low turnover and therefore companies with high turnover should also
> be excluded from the list of comparable companies. DRP rejected assessee's
> contentions without assigning any reason. Ld.AR placed reliance on decision
> of co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Genisys Integrating
> Systems (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra), wherein it was held that when there is a
> limit for the lower end for identifying the comparable companies, there is
> no reason why there should not be an upper turnover limit also, as size
> matters in business.
Ld.AR submitted that co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Dell
International Services India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in [2018] 89
taxmann.com 44 for Assessment Year 2005-06 considered various aspects of
application of turnover filter for excluding companies and observed that first
decision rendered on application of this filter was in case of Genisys
Integrating Systems (India) (P.) Ltd. (supra). Further, in case of Dell
International Services India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), co-ordinate bench of this
Tribunal discussed apparent divergent view of two non-jurisdictional High
Courts and also decision of this Tribunal in the case of Sysarris Software
(P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in [2016] 67 taxmann.com 243 (Bang. - Trib.),
wherein, Tribunal, after noticing decision of Hon'ble High Delhi Court in case
of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT reported in
[2015] 56 taxmann.com 417 and decision to the contrary by Hon'ble Bombay High
Court in case of CIT v. Pentair Water India (P.) Ltd. reported in [2016] 69
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  42 taxmann.com 180 held that, since there were
contrary views on the issue, therefore view favourable to assessee laid down
in case of Pentair Water India (P) Ltd. (supra) should be adopted. The Ld.CIT
DR submitted that turnover is not a relevant criteria to regard a company as
not comparable, so long the two companies are functionally comparable.
14\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. We have also referred to the decisions relied upon by both
sides.
It has been held in various decisions by this Tribunal that turnover filter is
a relevant filter. This Tribunal in case of Genesis Integrating Systems India
Pvt. Ltd., vs DCIT reported in (2012) 20 taxman.com
715\. In facts of present case, assessee has been set to be providing global
support business/tele-calling/global, consultancy services to group companies
and also provides after sales services and training.
It is observed that comparables sought to be excluded are 100 % Software
Development Companies, having high turnover, and therefore respectfully
following aforestated view in case of Genesis Integrating Systems India Pvt.
Ltd., vs DCIT (supra), these comparables are to be excluded because they have
high turnover of more than 200 Crore. It is submitted that subsequently this
Tribunal in case of Yodlee Infotech Pvt. Ltd vs ITO in IT(TP)A no.
108/Bang/2014 For assessment year 2009-10, vide order dated 12/12/14, excluded
these companies following Genesis Integrating systems Indi Pvt.Ltd
vs.DCIT(supra).
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  43 Reliance has been placed on decision of this
Tribunal in case of Autodesk India Pvt.Ltd. vs DCIT reported in (2018) 96
Taxmann.com 263 followed similar view to exclude identical comparables by
applying turnover filter, wherein all the decisions relied upon by Ld. CIT DR
has been considered and dealt with.
Therefore, respectfully following above decisions, we direct Ld.TPO to exclude
Flextronics Software Systems Ltd., iGate Global Solutions Ltd., Infosys
Technologies., Mindtree Ltd.,Persistent Systems Ltd., Sasken Communications
Technologies Ltd (seg.)., Tata Elxsi Ltd., Wipro Ltd (seg.) from final list as
they fail turnover filter of 1-200 Crores.
B. Ld.AR submitted that Geometric Ltd (seg) is to be excluded as related party
transaction of this comparable is more than 15%. Geometric Ltd (seg):
It has been alledged by Ld.AR that this company fail in RPT filter of less
that 15%, as applied by Ld.TPO.
It has been submitted that the range of RPT filter generally accepted by
coordinate benches of this tribunal is 5% to 25%. Ld.AR placed reliance upon
decision of coordinate bench of this tribunal in case of M/s novel software
development (India) private limited vs DCIT in ITA (TP) A No. 1287/Bang/2011
for assessment year 2007-08 for exclusion of this comparable. C. Ld. DR placed
reliance upon orders of authorities below.
15\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the
records placed before us. It is observed that this tribunal has remitted this
comparable back to Ld.TPO by observing as under:
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  44 "31. ........ Question of having a higher RPT
level or lower RPT 11 would depend on the No. of comparables available after
exclusions. In the case before us there are 26 comparables and even after
exclusion there will definitely be at list 9 comparables. Hence we are of the
opinion that RPT at 15% can rightly be applied. Since assessee had not raced
this ground before any of the authorities below, we remit the question of
exclusion of geometric Ltd back to the file of the AO/TPO for consideration
afresh."
Even in the case before us it is observed that there are 8 comparables left
after exclusion of the alleged comparables. However assessee has raised this
issue before us for the 1 st time and accordingly respectfully following
aforestated view of coordinate bench of this tribunal, we also remit this
comparable back to Ld.TPO for consideration afresh.
Ld.AR submitted that assessee seeks to exclude following comparables on
functional dissimilarities:  Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.,  Celestial Labs
Ltd  KALS Information Systems Ltd (seg.) Accel Transmatic Ltd.
It has been submitted by Ld.AR that activities of this company is different
with assessee and that this company was functionally different from assessee,
as it was engaged in services in form of ACCEL IT and ACCEL animation services
for 2D and 3D animation and therefore Ld.AR submitted that this company was
functionally different.
Besides the above, it was pointed out that this company has related party
transactions which is more than the permitted level and IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  45 therefore should not be taken for comparability purposes.
The submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee was that if the above
company should not be considered as comparable.
Ld. DR, on the other hand, relied on the order of the TPO.
16\. We have considered submissions advanced by both sides and perused records
placed before us.
It is observed that has accepted that this company is functionally not
comparable with assesses, as it is engaged in software development services
business, as compared to a captive service provider like assessee. Plea of
assessee that aforesaid company should not be treated as comparables was
considered by Tribunal in Maphasis Ltd. vs.ACIT reported in (2017) 83
taxmann.com 362, First Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd. Vs DCIT in IT(TP)
A No. 1086/Bang/2011. It is observed that this comparable has been excluded
for aforastated reasons by this Tribunal in case of Capgemini India (F) Ltd.
Vs ACIT reported in 12 taxman.com 51, where assessee was captive software
developer. Accepting argument of Ld.AR, we hold that aforesaid company should
be excluded as comparables.
Respectfully following decisions of this Tribunal in similar set of facts,
these companies are directed to be excluded from list of comparables.
a) Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd.
It has been submitted that this company is functionally different from the
assessee. Based on the information available in company's website, it has been
submitted that this company developed a software product by name "DXchange".
It was also submitted that IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  46 this company has
revenue from software product sales, apart from rendering of software services
for which segmental information is not available. It has therefore been
submitted that this company is functionally different from assessee. It was
further submitted that Mumbai Bench of Tribunal in case of Telcordia
Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT in ITA No.7821/Mum/2011 accepted assessee's
contention that this company has revenue from software product and observed
that in absence of segmental details, Avani Cincom cannot be considered as
comparable to an assessee who was rendering captive software development
services.
Ld.DR, on the other hand, relied on order of Ld.TPO.
17\. We have considered submissions advanced by both sides and perused records
placed before us.
It was submitted that this company has made unusually high profit during the
financial year 06-07. It is observed that Operating revenues increased 63.03%
which indicates that it was an extraordinary year for this company. Even
growth of software industry for previous year as per NASSCOM was 32%. The
growth rate of this company was double the industry average. In view of the
above, it was argued that this company ought to have been rejected as a
comparable.
It was observed by this Tribunal in case of Telcordia Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
v. ACIT(supra ) that margin of this company is 52.59% which represents
abnormal circumstances and profits. Following figures were relied by Ld.AR, as
observed by coordinate bench of IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  47 this Tribunal in
case of First Advantage Offshore Services Pvt.Ltd. Vs DCIT(supra):-
Particulars 2005-06 20006-07 20007-08 2008-09 Operating 21761611 35477523
29342809 28039851 Revenue Operating 16417661 23249646 23359186 31108949 Expns
Operating 5343950 12227877 5983623 (3069098) Profit Operating 32.55% 52.59%
25.62% - 9.87% Margin We, therefore, direct Ld.TPO to exclude this company
from final list.
b) Celestial Labs Ltd.
It has been submitted that this research & development company. In this
regard, the following submissions were made:-
As per Notes to Accounts - Schedule 15, under "Deferred Revenue Expenditure"
(page ____ of PB-II), it is mentioned that, "Expenditure incurred on research
and development of new products has been treated as deferred revenue
expenditure and same has been written off in 10 years equally yearly
installments from the year in which it is incurred." An amount of
Rs.11,692,020/- has been debited to Profit and Loss Account as "Deferred
Revenue Expenditure". This amounts to nearly 8.28 percent of sales of this
company.
17.1 Reliance was made to decision of Mumbai Bench of Tribunal in case of Teva
Pharma Private Ltd. v. Addl. CIT - ITA No.6623/Mum/2011 (for AY 2007-08) in
which comparability of this company for clinical trial research segment. The
Company has developed a drug design tool "CELSUITE" to find lead molecules for
drug discovery and has patented the same. It has observed that IT(TP)A
No.1220(B)/2011  48 this Company developed molecule to treat Leucoderma and
multiple cancer which is also protected under IPR by filing patent. It is
observed that this company is planning to set up biotechnology facility to
manufacture industrial enzymes, which include research laboratories for
carrying out further R & D activities to develop new drug molecules and
license them to Interested Pharma and Bio Companies across the GLOBE. It is
thus observed that this company is into diversified activities and therefore
cannot be considered as functionally comparable with Assessee who is a captive
service provider. It was thus submitted that, this company is not into
software development activities, accordingly, this company should be rejected
as comparable being functionally different.
Ld.DR, on the other hand, relied on order of Ld.TPO.
18\. We have considered submissions advanced by both sides and perused records
placed before us.
It has been pointed out that this company provides software products/services
as well as bioinformatics services and that the segmental data for each
activity is not available and therefore this company should not be treated as
comparable. Besides the above, the Assessee pointed out from annual report
highlighting the fact that, this company is into developing biotechnology
products and provides related software development services, without any
segmental details. There is no detail regarding nature of software development
services performed by this comapny. Celestial labs had come out with a public
issue of shares and in that connection issued Draft Red Herring Prospectus
(DRHP) in which business of IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  49 this company was
explained as to clinical research. We are of the view that in light of
submissions made by Ld.AR and the fact that this company was
basically/admittedly in clinical research and manufacture of bio products and
other products, there is no clear basis on which it could be held that this
company is mainly in the business of providing software development services.
We therefore direct Ld.TPO to exclude this company from final list.
KALS Information Systems Ltd (seg.) It has been contended that this company
has revenues from both software development and software products. It is also
pointed out that this company is engaged in providing training and that as per
the annual repot, salary cost debited under software development expenditure
was Rs45,93,351/- which is less than 25% of software services revenue and
therefore fails in salary cost filter testapplied by Ld.TPO. Reliance has been
placed on decision of this Tribunal for assessment year 2007-08, in case of
Maphasis Ltd. vs ACIT (supra) wherein KALS as comparable was rejected being
functionally different from software companies. The relevant extract are as
follows:
"16. Another issue relating to selection of comparables by the TPO is
regarding inclusion of Kals Information System Ltd. The assessee has objected
to its inclusion on the basis that functionally the company is not comparable.
With reference to pages 185-186 of the Paper Book, it is explained that the
said company is engaged in development of software products and services and
is not comparable to software development services provided by the assessee.
The appellant has submitted an extract on pages 185-186 of the Paper Book from
the website of the company to establish that it is engaged in providing of I T
enabled services and that the said company is into development of software
products, etc. All these aspects have not been factually rebutted and, in our
view, the said concern is liable to be excluded from the final set of
comparables, and thus on this aspect, assessee succeeds.
IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  50 Based on all the above, it was submitted on behalf
of the assessee that KALS Information Systems Limited should be rejected as a
comparable."
Ld.DR, on the other hand, relied on order of Ld.TPO.
19\. We have considered submissions advanced by both sides and perused records
placed before us.
We find that Ld.TPO concluded on basis of information obtained by issue of
notice u/s.133(6) of the Act. This information which was not available in
public domain could not have been used by Ld.TPO, when the same is contrary to
annual report of this company as highlighted by Ld.AR. We also find that in
the decision referred to by Ld.AR, of this Tribunal held that this company was
developing software products and not purely or mainly software development
service provider.
We therefore accept the plea of the Assessee that this company is not
comparable.
Megasoft Ltd., It has been submitted that this company is functionally similar
to assessee. However Ld.TPO adopted incorrect margin.
We thus set aside this comparable to Ld.AO/TPO with a direction to adopt
correct margin and to consider segmental level results for comparing it with
assessee.
Accordingly ground No. 1-6 stands allowed as indicated hereinabove.
20\. Ground No. 7 is in respect of disallowance of expenses claimed by
assessee from total turnover amounting to Rs. 65, 46, 623/-. This ground has
been raised by assessee, is in respect of exclusion of telecommunication
expenses, asset insurance expenses foreign exchange currency expenses and
foreign travel expenditure while IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  51 computing
deduction under section 10A of the Act upheld by Ld. CIT (A).
Ld.AR placed reliance upon the decision of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in
case of CIT vs Tata Elxsi Ltd reported in 349 ITR 98 and submitted that this
issue stands covered in favour of assessee. On the contrary,Ld.CIT DR placed
reliance upon the order passed by Ld.AO.
20.1 We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in the light of the
records placed before us.
It is observed that, Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case of CIT vs Tata Elxsi
Ltd(supra) on identical issue held that telecommunication expenses is to be
included while computing deduction under section 10 A of the act as it is
directly linked with earning of income. Ld CIT DR has not brought before us
any contradictory/distinguishable facts in respect of present case before us.
Respectfully following Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in case of CIT Vs Tata
Elxsi Ltd(supra), we direct Ld.AO to include telecommunication expenses while
computing exempt income u/s10A of the Act.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed.
21\. Ground No. 8 is in respect of amounts paid to hotel amounting to Rs.2,15,
579/-towards whom hire charges and food expenses on the ground that no tax was
deducted.
It has been submitted by Ld.AR that therefore stated amount was not
substantiated by assessee with supporting documents and evidences it has been
submitted that the payments were made to Golden Palms and Taj residency for
banquet and food for the IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011  52 purpose of seminar
conducted by assessee and companies annual Day celebration respectively. It
was thus submitted that there was not liable to TDS. He placed reliance upon
CBDT circular No. 5/2002 dated 08/08/95 wherein it has been very clearly
mentioned that the rooms hired on regular basis are liable for TDS. Ld.AR
submitted that in the present case the payments have been made for conducting
seminars and companies annual Day celebrations and the hotels had not
earmarked any room at a specific rate. He also submitted that the hotels were
under no legal obligation to provide the rooms and the rooms were hired for a
maximum period of 3 days on regular basis.
On the contrary, Ld.DR, placed reliance upon orders passed by authorities
below.
22\. We have perused the submissions advanced by both sides in the light of
the records placed before us. It is observed that the occupancy of the rooms
in Golden Palm hotels was occasional and was taken on regular basis. Further
the expenditure was incurred by assessee for the purposes of business on which
TDS is not liable to be deducted.
Accordingly we delete addition made by Ld.AO. In the result this ground raised
by assessee stands allowed.
23\. Ground No. 10 has been raised by assessee for shortfall in TDs credit
granted.
It has been submitted that assessee is eligible for credit of tax amounting to
Rs.23,24,487/-whereas assessing officer has granted IT(TP)A No.1220(B)/2011
53 TDs amounting to Rs.22,80,801/- thereby causing shortfall of Rs.43,686/-.
Ld.TPO is directed to verify the details and provide credit for the tour
shortfall as claimed by assessee.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
24.Ground No. 11 in respect of considering refund of Rs.11,20,000/-as issued
to assessee. It has been submitted that no such refund has been issued to
assessee. Ld. AO is directed to verify the same issue refund as per law.
Accordingly this ground raised by assessee stands allowed for statistical
purposes.
25\. Ground No. 12-14 are in respect of interest computed under section 234B &
D and penalty under section 271 (1) (c ) of the Act. As these are
consequential in nature and premature at this stage, do not require any
adjudication.
26\. Ground No. 15-16 are general in nature and therefore do not require any
adjudication.
In the result appeal filed by assessee stands allowed as indicated of.

Without prejudice to the above, the order issued by the AO is bad in law
insofar as the fact that the AO did not issue to Telelogic India Private
