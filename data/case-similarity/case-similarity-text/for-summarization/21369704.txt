No.79-81 of 2012 Page 4 of 47 Total Amount of 26,12,00,141 Quantified
Compensation Claimed against the Respondents
8\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant points out that the total
compensation claimed against the Respondents is Rs.26,12,00,141/- and that the
Applicant has paid a sum of Rupees three lakhs towards the fees payable in
terms of Rule 4 of the Competition Appellate Tribunal (Form and Fee for Filing
an Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation Applications) Rules, 2009.
9\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant contends that the Respondent Nos.1
to 3 take a plea that the Compensation Application filed by the Applicant
centers around the assumption that Section 53N of the Act requires the
existence of either the former Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT)/
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal or the Competition Commission of
India's order. Further, the stand of the Respondents is that since the orders
of CCI dated 12.04.2012 and the order of COMPAT dated 29.10.2013 had merged
into the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 08.05.2017 (by virtue of
'Doctrine of Merger'), the Applicant's Compensation Application is not
maintainable.
10\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant contends that the Compensation
Application filed by the Applicant is maintainable under Section 53N of the
Competition Act, 2002 and that apart, the Section 53N(1) of the Act requires
that a compensation claim must 'arise from the Compensation Application (AT)
No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 5 of 47
findings of the 'Competition Commission of India' or the 'Appellate Tribunal',
which means that the 'cause of action' for the compensation claim must come
into being due to/ because of an order either of the 'Competition Commission
of India' or the 'Appellate Tribunal'. Added further, it is the contention of
the Applicant that it does not require that the said CCI's order or the
COMPAT's order must necessarily subsist in Law.
11\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant takes an emphatic plea that Section
53N of the Act must be read with Explanation (b) to Section 53N, which
provides that when an application under Section 53N of the Act is received by
the Hon'ble Tribunal, it is required to make an enquiry into the allegations
as per Section 53N(3) of the Act and then pass its orders. In fact, contention
of the Applicant is that the ingredients of Section 53N of the Act do not
mandate the existence of an order of the 'Competition Commission of India' or
the 'Competition Appellate Tribunal' and all it requires is that a Claimant's
cause of action should come into being on account of an earlier 'CCI' or
'COMPAT' order.
12\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant refers to Section 53N(2) of the Act
and submits that the phrase 'if any', which specifies that 'Compensation
Application' can be filed even if the CCI does not find a violation but the
COMPAT/ the Hon'ble Tribunal finds a breach. Therefore, it is the submission
of the Applicant's side that the contention of the Respondents that an order
of CCI or COMPAT must legally be in Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of
2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 6 of 47 existence, is an
unfounded one. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant to lend support to his
view point refers to paragraph 11.2 of the Competition Law Review Committee
Report 2019, which is as under: -
> "11.2 The Committee noted that Section 53N currently does not allow
> application for compensation claims to be filed post determination of appeal
> by the Supreme Court. This may prejudice parties as they will be deprived
> from claiming any compensation, especially in cases where the CCI and the
> Appellate Tribunal do not find a contravention, but the Supreme Court finds
> a contravention."
13\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant contends that the Act does not
prescribe a Limitation period for projecting an application under Section 53N
of the Act and that under the earlier Monopolies and Restrictive Trade
Practices Act, 1969, three years was considered to be a reasonable period of
limitation. Indeed, it is the Applicant's submission that the period of
Limitation is to be counted from the date of receipt of Hon'ble Supreme Court
judgment dated 08.05.2017 and in this regard the Applicant places reliance on
the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 'Union of India v. West Coast Paper
Mills Limited \- (2004) 2 SCC 747', (special page 754), wherein at paragraphs
15 and 16 it is observed as under :-
> "15. Even in relation to a civil dispute, an appeal is considered to be a
> continuation of the suit and a decree becomes executable only when the same
> is finally disposed of by the court of appeal.
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 7 of 47
16\. The starting point of limitation for filing a suit for the purpose of
recovery of the excess amount of freight illegally realised would, thus, begin
from the date of the order passed by this Court. It is also not in dispute
that the respondent herein filed a writ petition which was not entertained on
the ground stated hereinbefore. The respondents were, thus, also entitled to
get the period during which the writ petition was pending, excluded for
computing the period of limitation. In that view of the matter, the civil suit
was filed within the prescribed period of limitation."
14\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant submits that the limitation will
begin to run only after final determination of dispute by the final Court in
related proceedings and when an Appeal is filed before a higher Forum and the
same is entertained, the judgment of the concerned Tribunal or Hon'ble High
Court is in jeopardy.
15\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant refers to the decision of this
Appellate Tribunal in 'Reliance Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. v. Hotel
Poonja International Private Limited in Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No.1011 of
2019' dated 05.02.2020, wherein at paragraph 40 it is observed as under: -
> "40. It is to be borne in mind Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 not
> only applies to the Civil Procedure Code but also to the Special Acts. As a
> matter of fact, Article 137 constitutes a Residuary Article pertaining to
> 'Applications'. As such it can be safely and securely be said that Article
> 137 will apply Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition
> Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 8 of 47 to the Civil Procedure Code or in
> respect of any other special statute. What Article 113 of the Limitation
> Act, 1963 relates to suit, the Article 137 of the Limitation Act, pertains
> to 'Application'."
16\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant cites the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in 'Sonic Surgical v. National Insurance Company Ltd.
\- (2010) 1 SCC 135' and contends that it is a settled principle of Law that
Courts must avoid absurd interpretations.
17\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant submits that the instant
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 filed by the Applicant/ FCI
relates to common orders passed by the CCI and erstwhile COMPAT and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and the 'lis' concerned in those orders was common and
interlinked and on that basis only a single Application was filed. In this
connection, the Learned Counsel for the Applicant informs this Tribunal that
the Applicant/ FCI is willing to amend its present Application and file
separate Applications with necessary filing fees and in the alternative it is
willing to pay the differential filing fees also, if the same is permitted by
this Tribunal.
18\. According to the Learned Counsel for the Applicant, it being a public
Body, operates entirely on public funds and the compensation it claims is also
for the 'public purpose'. Also, the stand of the Applicant is that the
foundation of the compensation claim under Section 53N of the Act is the
findings of contravention by delinquent enterprise and when the delinquent
enterprise assails the decision of the Hon'ble Tribunal in an Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012
Page 9 of 47 Appeal under Section 53T of the Act, there is a chance that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court may allow the Appeal, set aside the findings of
violation and exonerate the delinquent enterprise. Moreover, in the event of
this Tribunal adjudicating a compensation claim and awards damages to the
claimant, before the disposal of main Appeal by the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
there is a possibility/ chance that the entire foundation of the compensation
claim may become an infructuous one and non-est in Law. Therefore, it is the
forceful plea of the Appellant that every time a delinquent enterprise
challenges the order of the Tribunal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court under
Section 53T of the Act, this Tribunal have to wait for the 'cause of action'
to attain finality before proceeding and adjudicating a 'compensation claim'
under Section 53N of the Act.
19\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant refers to the order of this
Tribunal in 'CA (AT) (COMPT.) No. 01 of 2017 dated 03.01.2018 in Crown Theatre
v. Kerala Film Exhibition Federation' and 'Metropolitan Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. v. National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.' order dated 08.03.2018,
wherein this Tribunal had decided to wait for the decision of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in respect of an Applicant's compensation claim attaining finality. The
Learned Counsel for the Applicant contends that Section 424 of the Companies
Act, 2013 is pari-materia with Section 53-O of the Act and that the National
Company Law Tribunal and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ought to
follow the 'principles of natural justice', although both the Tribunals do
have the powers to regulate their own procedure etc. Compensation Application
(AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 10 of 47
20\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant cites the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in 'Corporation Bank v. Navin J. Shah \- (2000) 2 SCC 628' (at
special page 635), wherein at paragraph 12 among other things, it is observed
as under: -
> "....The difficulties in realisation of the amounts due from the consignee
> also became clear at the time when the claim was made before the Corporation
> and the claim had been made as early as on 19-12-1982. The petition before
> the Commission was filed on 25-9- 1992 that is clearly a decade after a
> claim had been made before the Corporation. A claim could not have been
> filed by the respondent at this distance of time.
Indeed at the relevant time there was no period of limitation under the
Consumer Protection Act to prefer a claim before the Commission but that does
not mean that the claim could be made even after an unreasonably long delay.
The Commission has rejected this contention by a wholly wrong approach in
taking into consideration that the foreign exchange payable to Reserve Bank of
India was still due and, therefore, the claim is alive. The claim of the
respondent is from the Bank. At any rate, as stated earlier, when the claim
was made for indemnifying the losses suffered from the Corporation, it was
clear to the parties about the futility of awaiting any longer for collecting
such amounts from the foreign bank. In those circumstances, the claim, if at
all was to be made, ought to have been made within a reasonable time
thereafter. What is reasonable time to lay a claim depends upon the facts of
each case. In the legislative Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in
Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 11 of 47 wisdom, three years'
period has been prescribed as the reasonable time under the Limitation Act to
lay a claim for money. We think that period should be the appropriate standard
adopted for computing reasonable time to raise a claim in a matter of this
nature. For this reason also we find that the claim made by the respondent
ought to have been rejected by the Commission."
21\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant cites the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in 'G. Ramegowda, Major and others v. Special Land Acquisition
Officer, Bangalore \- (1988) 2 SCC 142' (at special page
143), wherein it is observed as under: -
> "The law of limitation is, no doubt, the same for a private citizen as for
> governmental authorities. Government, like any other litigant must take
> responsibility for the acts or omissions of its officers.
But a somewhat different complexion is imparted to the matter where Government
makes out a case where public interest was shown to have suffered owing to
acts of fraud or bad faith on the part of its officers or agents and where the
officers were clearly at cross-purposes with it. Therefore, in assessing what,
in a particular case, constitutes "sufficient cause" for purposes of Section
5, it might, be somewhat unrealistic to exclude from the considerations that
go into the judicial verdict, those factors which are peculiar to and
characteristic of the functioning of the government. Implicit in the very
nature of government functioning is procedural delay incidental to the
decision-making process. Due Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in
Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 12 of 47 recognition of these
limitations on governmental functioning -- of course, within a reasonable
limit -- is necessary. It would be unfair and unrealistic to put government
and private parties on the same footing in all respects in such matters."
22\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant refers the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in 'S.S. Rathore v. State of Madhya Pradesh \- (1989) 4 SCC
582', wherein it is observed as under: -
> "The question, therefore, is as to when the right to sue first accrued
> within the meaning of Article 58. The order of dismissal made by the
> Collector did merge into the order of the Divisional Commissioner when the
> appellant's appeal was dismissed on August 31, 1966\. The 60 days' time
> spent for complying with the requirement of notice under Section 80 of the
> Code was available to the plaintiff in addition to the period of three
> years. Counting the date from the date of the appellate order, the suit
> would be within time. There is no justification for the distinction between
> courts and tribunals being appellate or revisional authorities in regard to
> the principle of merger as was done as in Mohammad Nooh case. Powers of
> adjudication ordinarily vested in courts are being exercised under the law
> by tribunals and other constituted authorities."
23\. Apart from the above, the Learned Counsel for the Applicant relies on the
decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in 'M.S. Shoes East Ltd. v. Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012
Page 13 of 47 M.R.T.P. Commission and Ors. - (2003) SCC OnLine Del 988'
wherein at paragraph 29 it is observed: -
> "29. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court aptly observed in the Corporation
> Bank (supra) that even when the Legislature has not specified any statutory
> time limit, the claim has to be filed within reasonable time. The Court
> further held what is reasonable time to lay claim depends upon the facts of
> each case. In the Legislative wisdom three years period has been prescribed
> to lay a claim for money. The Court observed that the period of three years
> is reasonable time to raise a claim in a matter of this nature. The claim
> which has been sought by the petitioner is in the nature of a money claim
> and on the analogy of Corporation Bank's case (supra), the claim ought to
> have been filed within statutory period of three years. The Commission has
> correctly appreciated the ratio of the Corporation Bank. It was also
> submitted by the Counsel for the respondent that the Commission has been
> consistently following the ratio of Corporation Bank in similar cases for
> several years."
24\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant contends that in a case where the
CCI does not find a contravention after the completion of the investigation by
the Director General (DG), it passes an order exonerating an enterprise under
Section 26(6) of the Act. Later, in an 'Appeal' under Section 53B of the Act,
this Tribunal has powers to consider the investigation report of the DG and
come to a different conclusion from that of the CCI and levy penalty under an
order passed under Section 56B (3) Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019
in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 14 of 47 of the Act. As a
matter of fact, Section 56B (3) enjoins upon this Tribunal to pass any such
order as it deems fit, confirming, modifying or setting aside the order of CCI
and if the Hon'ble Tribunal can impose penalty while confirming/ modifying the
order of CCI when it found a breach, there is no reason why the said power
does not extend to a situation when the CCI did not find a contravention.
25\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant submits that if all the parties are
involved in the same cause of action, a judicial proceeding may be commenced
by a party against plurality of parties and in fact, Order I Rule 3 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 2002 (CPC) permits the filing of a single suit before
a Civil Court against multiple defendants/parties. Provided, if the 'cause of
action' centers around multiple Respondents. On the side of Applicant a
reference was made to the decision "Shree Metaliks Ltd. v. Union of India \-
(2017) 203 Comp Cas Page 442 (Cal.)" wherein, it is among other things
observed that NCLT and NCLAT as per Section 424 of the Companies Act do have
powers to regulate their own procedure etc.
26\. The Learned Counsel for the Applicant submits that just because an
Applicant has filed the present single Compensation Application, the same
cannot be dismissed and he refers to a decision "Bachhaj Nahar V. Nilima
Mandal \- (2008) 17 SCC 491" and puts forward a plea that 'issues' not raised
in the pleadings cannot be ushered in at an argument stage.
27\. Lastly, it is the submission of Learned Counsel for the Applicant that
the Applicant/ public Body claims compensation because it was Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012
Page 15 of 47 overcharged by the Respondents and only for a public purpose,
the compensation is sought for.
28\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent submits that Section 53N of
the Act does not mention about the possibility of filing of a Compensation
Application 'arising from' an order of Hon'ble Supreme Court in an Appeal
against order of the Appellate Tribunal. Moreover, it is the plea of the 1st
Respondent that the 'Competition Law Review Committee Report' dated 26.07.2019
submitted to the 'Ministry of Corporate Affairs' also clearly mentions that
Section 53N of the Act, as currently framed, does not contemplate the filing
of a 'Compensation Application' after the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
and has proposed an amendment to permit a 'Compensation Application' arising
from the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order.
29\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent contends that a Compensation
Application under Section 53N of the Act cannot be filed after an order of the
Appellate Tribunal merges into an order of Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this
connection, the Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent brings it to the notice
of this Tribunal that when the present Compensation Application was filed on
11.07.2019 before this Tribunal, neither the findings of the Commission, nor
the order of the Appellate Tribunal were in existence because of the fact that
the order of the CCI dated 23.04.2012 had merged with the order dated
29.10.2013 of the earlier COMPAT. Further, the order dated 29.10.2013 of the
COMPAT, in Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal
(AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 16 of 47 turn had merged into the final judgment
dated 08.05.2017 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
30\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent refers to the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Sangeeta Singh v. Union of India - (2005) 7 SCC 484'
to contend that failure to mention orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is an
'error' or 'omission' on the part of Parliament and the same can be remedied
only by the Parliament through necessary amendments and not for the Courts to
do so.
31\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent cites the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Khoday Distilleries Limited v. Shri Mahadeshwara \-
(2019) 4 SCC 376', wherein the correctness of the decision of another Bench of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India was upheld in 'Kunhayammed v. State of
Kerala \- (2000) 6 SCC 359'.
32\. According to the Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent, some of the key
findings affirmed in Khoday Distilleries Limited from Kunhayammed case include
the following: -
> "12. The logic underlying the doctrine of merger is that there cannot be
> more than one decree or operative orders governing the same subject-matter
> at a given point of time. When a decree or order passed by an inferior
> court, tribunal or authority was subjected to a remedy available under the
> law before a superior forum then, though the decree or order under challenge

> jeopardy. Once the superior court has disposed of the lis before it either

> No.79-81 of 2012 Page 17 of 47 way -- whether the decree or order under

> order of the superior court, tribunal or authority which is the final,
> binding and operative decree or order wherein merges the decree or order

> "42. "To merge" means to sink or disappear in something else; to become
> absorbed or extinguished; to be combined or be swallowed up. Merger in law
> is defined as the absorption of a thing of lesser importance by a greater,
> whereby the lesser ceases to exist, but the greater is not increased; an
> absorption or swallowing up so as to involve a loss of identity and
> individuality. (See Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LVII, pp. 1067-68.)" "44. To
> sum up, our conclusions are:
> (i) Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order passed by a
> court, tribunal or any other authority before superior forum and such
> superior forum modifies, reverses or affirms the decision put in issue
> before it, the decision by the subordinate forum merges in the decision by

33\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent refers to the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court 'S.S. Rathore vs. State of MP \- (1989) 4 SCC 582' (at
special page 589), wherein at paragraph 14 it is observed as under: -
> "14. The distinction adopted in Mohammad Nooh case [AIR 1958 SC 86 : 1958
> SCR 595] between a court and a tribunal being the appellate or the
> revisional authority is one without any legal justification. Powers of
> adjudication ordinarily vested in courts are being exercised under the law

> indicated, it must be held that the order of dismissal made by the Collector
> did merge into the order of the Divisional Commissioner when the appellant's
> appeal was dismissed on August 31, 1966."
34\. Therefore, it is the plea of the 1st Respondent that the orders of
'Statutory Tribunal' are also subject to the 'principle of merger' and as
such, the present Compensation Application is not maintainable because of the
fact that the CCI's order dated 23.04.2012 and COMPAT's order dated 29.10.2013
do not exist in the eye of Law.

35\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent cites the following decisions:
-
> (a) The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Jagmittar Sain Bhagat &
> Ors. v. Director Health Services \- (2013) 10 SCC 136' (at special page 137,
> it is observed as under:-
> "Indisputably, it is a settled legal proposition that conferment of

> the consent of the parties nor by a superior court, and if the court passes

(b) In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court 'P. Malaichami v.
M. Andi Ambalam and Ors. - (1973) 2 SCC 170' at page 170, it is held that even
in the case of constitutional Court like the High Court, when it causes a
Statutory Tribunal to hear election petitions under the Representation of the
People Act, 1951, its jurisdiction is limited and further its powers are
wholly the creature of the statute under which it is conferred with the power
to hear election pettions.
(c) In the decision 'Khoday Distilleries Ltd. & Ors. v. Sri Mahadeshwara
Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane Limited, Kollegal \- (2019) 4 SCC 376' (at special
page 378 and 379) wherein it is observed and held as under:-
> "The doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal or unlimited

> superior forum and the content or subject-matter of challenge laid or
> capable of being laid shall be determinative of the applicability of merger.

(d) The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent refers to the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Uper Doab Sugar Mills v. Shahdara (Delhi) Saharanpur
Light Railway Co.
\- (1963) 2 SCR 333' (at special page 347) wherein it is held that 'neither
expressly nor by necessary implication has the Railway Rates Tribunal been
given any jurisdiction to make any order for refund'.
(e) In the decision of 'Competition Commission of India v.
Steel Authority of India - (2010) 10 SCC 744' (at special page 745), wherein
it is observed as under: -
> "The respondent contends that word "or" may some times be read as
> disjunctive and therefore, the expression "any direction issued"
occurring in Section 53-A(1)(a) should be read as disjunctive and that would
give a complete right to a party to prefer an appeal under Section 53-A,
against a direction for investigation. However, there is no occasion to
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 22 of 47 read and interpret the word "or" in any
different form as that would completely defeat the intention of the
legislature.
The language of Section 53-A(1)(a) is clear and the statute does not demand
that one should substitute "or" or read that word interchangeably for
achieving the object of the Act. On the contrary, the objective of the Act is
more than clear that the legislature intended to provide a very limited right
to appeal. It is always expected of the court to apply plain rule of
constitution rather than trying to read the words into the statute which have
been specifically omitted by the legislature.
Right to appeal is a creation of statute and it does require application of
rule of plain construction. Such provision should neither be construed too
strictly nor too liberally.
The principle of "appeal being a statutory right and no party having a right
to file appeal except in accordance with the prescribed procedure" is now well
settled."
(f) In 'M/s Jindal Steel & Power Limited vs. Competition Commission of India &
Ors. and M/s. Prints India v. Springer (India) Pvt. Ltd.', the Competition
Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No.45 of 2012 with I.A. No.210 of 2012 on
03.04.2013 at paragraph No.26 observed as under: -
"26. Shri Billimoria argued in terms of the doctrine of casus omissus.
According to him, Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition
Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 23 of 47 there was a need for supplying the
casus omissus particularly in Section 53A(1)(a). We do not agree. It is a time
tested law that the courts are reluctant to supply the words to the legal
provisions. That can be done only in few exceptional circumstances like the
legal provision being rendered absurd or being rendered meaningless in the
absence of the words which is sought to be added. We do not think that there
is such a situation in the present appeals. We have pointed out that the Apex
Court has closed the issue on that count and we cannot therefore venture to
supply some different interpretation or supply any word to the aforementioned
provision."
(g) In the decision of 'M.P. Steel Corporation v. Commissioner of Central
Excise \- (2015) 7 SCC 58' (at page 58) it is held that even though provisions
of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 apply only to Courts proper i.e.
courts as understood in the strict sense of being part of the Judicial Branch
of the State, but principles underlying Section 14, which advance cause of
justice, will apply to appeals filed before quasi-judicial tribunal such as
that under Section 128 of Customs Act.

Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 24 of 47 Limited and others -
(2016) 3 SCC 468' (at special page
470) it is held as under: -
> "By itself the Limitation Act, 1963 is inapplicable to a proceeding or

In this context it is relevant to keep in view that the State Commission or
the Central Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal
(AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 25 of 47 Commission have been entrusted with large
number of diverse functions, many being administrative or regulatory and such
powers do not invite the rigours of the Limitation Act."

Application No.86 of 2007 (UTPE No.160 of 2007)' wherein at paragraph 13, it
is observed as under: -

(j) In the decision 'A.V. Papayya Sastry and others v. Govt. of A.P. and
others \- (2007) 4 SCC 221' it is held that 'fraud' vitiates all judicial acts
whether in rem or in personam and under the judgment, decree or order obtained
by fraud has to be treated as non est and nullity, whether by court of first
instance or by the final court. Further, it can be challenged in any court, at
any time in appeal, revision, writ or even in collateral proceedings and that
this is an exception to Article 141 of the Constitution of doctrine of merger.
36\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent submits that creation of the
right to seek compensation is a 'statute created right' and hence, to be read
in the light of limitations imbedded therein. Compensation Application (AT)
No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 27 of 47
37\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent contends that the explanation
to Section 53N of the Competition Act provides that an application for
compensation may be made only after a finding rendered by the 'Competition
Commission of India' or the 'COMPAT'.
38\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent contends that in the instant
case, the Applicant/ FCI has filed its Compensation Application on 11.07.2019,
more than five years and seven months after the COMPAT's order on 29.10.2013,
and seven years and three months of the 'Competition Commission of India's'
order on 23.04.2012. Moreover, it is the stand of the 1st Respondent that a
Compensation Application cannot be filed after the expiration of a reasonable
period of three years from the date of Appellate Tribunal's order.
39\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent comes out with an argument
that the 'West Coast' Case cited by the Applicant has no application to the
facts of the present case because of the fact that the provision of the
Railway Act, 1890 (as amended by the Amendment Act of 1948) are not in pari
materia.
40\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent vehemently submits that the
scheme of Section 53N of the Act does not permit the filing of a single
Compensation Application against more than one 'enterprise' because it uses
the term 'enterprise' and not 'enterprises', which unambiguously reveal the
intention of Parliament that separate applications are to be filed against
each 'enterprise' when claiming compensation under Section 53N of the Act.
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 28 of 47
41\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent submits that a Compensation
Application under Section 53N of the Act is not an 'Independent proceeding'
and that a Compensation Application may be filed only after the order of CCI
or the Appellate Tribunal determines that a violation of the Act had taken
place.
42\. The Learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent urges before this Tribunal
that the instant Compensation Application is to be dismissed because of the
fact that the Applicant has come before this Tribunal with 'unclean hands'.
43\. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent contends that the Competition
Commission of India passed an order (under Section 27 of the Act) against the
Respondents on 23.04.2012, which was partially upheld by the former COMPAT on
29.10.2013. In fact, the COMPAT while confirming the violation of Section
3(3)(d) of the Act against the Respondents, distinguished the quantum of
penalty on the basis of 'relevant turnover' and thus, the Limitation period to
file Compensation Application by the Applicant commenced from 29.10.2013.
Apart from that the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 08.05.2017 upheld the COMPAT's
decision, which is beyond 28.10.2016, i.e., limitation period to file the
Compensation Application.
44\. It is the version of the 2nd Respondent that Schedule 1 of Art. 137 of
the Limitation Act, 1963 specifies three years Limitation period and that the
three years period is to be reckoned when the right to apply accrues
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 29 of 47 and in the case on hand, six years had passed
by, from the date of judgment of the COMPAT dated 29.10.2013.
45\. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent contends that if a statue does
not prescribe a limitation period in regard to money claims, the reasonable
time period within which the Applicant must file its claim is three years. In
fact, the clear cut stand of the 2nd Respondent is that the Compensation
Application filed by the Applicant is hopelessly time barred and is in
violation of the Limitation Act.
46\. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent by referring to the proposed
Competition Amendment Bill, 2020 to 'insert in Section 53N of the Act' points
out that the Application of the Applicant is on the date of filing of the same
by the public Body was not maintainable being time barred, based on the reason
that 'the Amendment Bill' is an intent of the Union of India to make a
prospective amendment to Section 53N of the Act, which cannot be any stretch
of imagination will have retrospective effect.
47\. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent points out that the
Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (MSEI), had filed a Compensation
Application (under Section 53N of the Competition Act) before the former
COMPAT, while an Appeal was pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and later
transferred to this Tribunal.
48\. The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent submits that the Hon'ble

of 2014)" on 12.02.2018 had stayed the damages proceedings and this Tribunal
adjourned the damages proceedings sine-die as per order dated 08.03.2018.
Therefore, it is the clear cut stand of the 2nd Respondent that the present
Applicant is well within its rights to apply for compensation before the
Appellate Tribunal even when the matter was appealable and is pending before
the Hon'ble Apex Court.
49\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent submits that the Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 filed by the Applicant is not maintainable and
is to be dismissed because of the reason that Section 53N of the Act does not
permit filing of a single Application claiming compensation against multiple
parties. At this stage, the Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent projects an
argument that the language used in Section 53N of the Act makes it clear that
an application can only be filed against 'single enterprise' and not against
'three enterprises', as has been done by the Applicant in the instant case.
50\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent contends that the Applicant
had misled this Tribunal by making payment of Rupees thee lakhs lakhs in terms
of Rule 4 of the Competition Appellate Tribunal (Form and Fee for Filing an
Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation Applications) Rules, 2009, as against
the payment of Rupees three lakhs per application per Respondent. In this
connection, the Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent submits that the
Applicant during the argument had accepted Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 31 of 47 the lapse on
its part and offered to make an additional payment of Rupees six lakhs, so as
to ensure that its application is not dismissed on this ground alone.
Furthermore, the Act and the Rule 4 of the Competition Appellate Tribunal
(Form and Fee for Filing an Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation
Applications) Rules, 2009 do not permit acceptance of any additional filing
fee of Rupees six lakhs for Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019.
51\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent points out that the Applicant
had failed to satisfy this Tribunal on the condition specified under Rule 4(3)
of the Competition Appellate Tribunal (Form and Fee for Filing an Appeal and
Fee for Filing Compensation Applications) Rules, 2009 covering waiver of
application fee.
52\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent contends that a Court of Law
while interpreting a provision only interprets the Law and cannot legislate
it. Further, if a provision of Law is misused and subjected to the abuse of
process of Law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if
deemed necessary as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Padma Sundara
Rao v. State of Tamil Nadu' reported in (2002) 3 SCC 533 (vide para nos. 14 &
15)'.
53\. Continuing further, it is the stand of the 3rd Respondent that the powers
of the Tribunal are unambiguously and unequivocally covered in terms of
Section 53A and 53B of the Act and therefore, this Tribunal can entertain a
Compensation Application only in terms of Section 53N of the Act, as per
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 'Competition Compensation Application
(AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 32 of 47
Commission of India v. Steel Authority of India \- (2010) 10 SCC Page 744'.
54\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent refers to the Applicant's
placing on reliance upon the interim orders passed by this Tribunal in -
(i) Crown Theatre vs. Kerala Film Exhibitors Federation; (ii) Metropolitan
Stock Exchange of India vs. National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.; and (iii)
Maharashtra State Generation Power Co. Ltd. vs. Nair Coal Services Ltd. & Ors.
and submits that it has been done by the Applicant with a view to invoke the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal and further that all the three interim orders
referred to by the Applicant were in an application filed prior to the
determination of an Appeal by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is in
accordance with Law enumerated under the Act. Furthermore, it is the stand of
the 3rd Respondent that 'interim orders' cannot be read as laying down any
proposition of law and they do not have any precedent value as per decision in
'State of Assam v. Barak Upatyaka D.U. Karmachari Sanstha \- (2009) 5 SCC 694
(paras 21 and 22)' and 'Ram Parshotam Mittal and Others v. Hotel Queen Road
Pvt. Ltd. and Others \- (2019) SCC OnLine SC 699 (para 64)'.
55\. Yet another argument advanced on behalf of the 3rd Respondent is that it
is a settled Law that a jurisdiction can be conferred only by a statute or
legislative function and a Court/ Tribunal cannot derive jurisdiction apart
from the statute.

56\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent cites the decision in'Uber
India Systems Pvt. Ltd. v. CCI & Ors. - (2019) 8 SCC 697' (at special page
700) wherein at paragraph 5 and 6 it is observed as under: -
> "5. There are two important ingredients which Section 4(1) itself refers to
> if there is to be an abuse of dominant position:
> (1) the dominant position itself.
> (2) its abuse.
> "Dominant position" as defined in Explanation (a) refers to a position of
> strength, enjoyed by an enterprise, in the relevant market, which, in this
> case is the National Capital Region (NCR), which: (1) enables it to operate
> independently of the competitive forces prevailing; or (2) is something that
> would affect its competitors or the relevant market in its favour.
> 6\. Given the allegation made, as extracted above, it is clear that if, in
> fact, a loss is made for trips made, Explanation (a)(ii) would prima facie
> be attracted inasmuch as this would certainly affect the appellant's
> competitors in the appellant's favour or the relevant market in its favour.
> Insofar as "abuse" of dominant position is concerned, under Section 4(2)(a),
> so long as this dominant position, whether directly or indirectly, imposes
> an unfair price in purchase or sale including predatory price of services,
> abuse of dominant position also gets attracted. Explanation (b) which
> defines "predatory price" means sale of services at a price which is below
> cost."

No.79-81 of 2012 Page 34 of 47
57\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent refers to the order of COMPAT
in 'Appeal No.43 of 2014 - Shri Surendra Prasad v. Competition Commission of
India & Ors.' wherein while allowing the Appeal and setting aside the majority
order of the Commission, the Director General was directed to conduct an
investigation into the allegations contained in the Information filed by the
Appellant under Section 19(1)(a) and submit report to the Commission within
three months etc.
58\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent relies on the order passed in
COMPAT in 'Appeal No.51 of 2015 - North East Petroleum Dealers Association v.
CCI & Ors. dated 26.11.2015' wherein while allowing the Appeal, the impugned
order was set aside and the matter was remanded to the Commission for issuance
of a direction to the Director General under Section 26(1) for conducting an
Investigation.
59\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent submits what applies to civil
suit has no bearing on a statutory Tribunal and the reliance placed by the
Applicant on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court "Union of India v. West
Coast Paper Mills \- (2004) 2 SCC page 747" is a misplaced one.
60\. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent contends that when an Appeal
under Section 53T of the Act is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
there was no stay except payment of penalty amount and there is no fetter for
this Tribunal to proceed further. Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019
in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 35 of 47
61\. This Tribunal has heard the Learned Counsel appearing for the Applicant
and the Respondents and noticed their contentions on the issue of
maintainability of the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019.
62\. It is to be pertinently pointed out that the Section 53N of the Act
speaks of 'Awarding compensation' and a mere perusal of the ingredients of the
said Section unerringly point out that the said Section does not contemplate a
Limitation period for projecting an 'Application'. It is an axiomatic
principle in Law that when no time limit is prescribed, based on the 'Doctrine
of Laches' the relevant proceedings ought to have been filed within a
reasonable period of time and that failure to do so results in serious
prejudice and harm to the concerned party and adversely affects the ability of
the said party to defend itself.
63\. In fact, the Competition Act, 2002 does not either by reference or in
comparison provide for any period of Limitation for the purpose of filing an
Application before COMPAT to adjudicate a case for compensation arising from
the findings of the CCI or from the orders of COMPAT or under Section 42A or
53Q(2). It is not in dispute that the Applicant had sent the Information
through letter dated 04.02.2011 under Section 19(1) of the Act to the Hon'ble
Commission alleging 'anti-competitive behavior' on the part of the three
Respondents and another. Further, the Applicant had alleged that the
Respondents had acted and resorted in a manner in regard to the tenders
released by the Applicant for purchasing Aluminum Phosphate Tablet (ALP) for
the period 2009-10. The Hon'ble Commission had initiated proceedings against
the Respondents and ordered an Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in
Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 36 of 47 Investigation and
finally the Commission came to the conclusion that the Respondents had
violated Section 3 of the Act and resultantly levied penalties in terms of the
Act. As a matter of fact, the Hon'ble Commission found that the Respondents
had cartelised in respect of the two tenders for purchase of ALP Tablets
released by the Applicant for the period from 2009-10 and 2011-12 and also it
was found out that the Respondent had colluded and fixed the prices for the
year 2009 tender and collusively boycotted the 2011 tender, thereby
contravening Section 3 of the Act.
64\. Admittedly, the order of the CCI dated 23.04.2012 was challenged by the
Respondents before the COMPAT and the erstwhile COMPAT sustained the findings
of the Commission, but reduced the penalty amount that were imposed on the
Respondents. In fact, the Respondents and the Commission challenged the COMPAT
decision before the Hon'ble Supreme Court under Section 53T of the Act and
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 08.05.2017 upheld the findings of the
Commission and held that the Respondents had violated Section 3(3)(b) and
Section 3(3)(d) in regard to the tenders released by the Applicant for the
period 2009-10 and 2011-12 and maintained the COMPAT's decision on the aspect
of penalty. It is not in dispute that these findings had attained finality.
65\. The Applicant has filed the instant Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 seeking compensation from the Respondents for a sum of
Rs.26,12,00,141/- in terms of Section 53N of the Competition Act, 2002.
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 37 of 47
66\. The Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 was filed by the
Applicant on 11.07.2019. In the instant case, earlier the CCI passed the order
on 03.04.2012 (under Section 27 of the Competition Act, 2002) and rendered a
finding that the Respondents had violated Section 3 of the Act etc. It was
also found out that the Respondents had consistently overcharged the Applicant
and their conduct had led to the losses being incurred by the Applicant. It is
quite evident that the erstwhile COMPAT on 29.10.2013 passed an order
affirming the findings of the CCI. In regard to the issue of 'turnover' the
COMPAT observed that the penalty would be based solely on the 'turnover' of
the relevant business, i.e., business of Aluminum Phosphate Tablet (ALP). When
the Respondents and the Hon'ble Commission projected their Appeals before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court by assailing the findings of the COMPAT, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court upheld the decision of the erstwhile COMPAT in totality.
67\. It may not be out of place for this Tribunal to significantly point out
that in the decision 'Uma Shankar Sharma v. The State of Bihar & Anr. - AIR
2005 Patna 94' wherein a Decree Holder being aggrieved by the impugned order
challenged the same in Second Appeal, which resulted into a Decree passed by
the Hon'ble High Court, the Decree of the Court below merges with the judgment
and Decree in Second Appeal and it was held that the period of Limitation
under Article 136 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is to be counted from the date
of judgment in Second Appeal. Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in
Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 38 of 47
68\. Further, when a 'Decree' of the Trial Court having merged with the Decree
of the 'Appellate Court', it is observed that the starting point of limitation
for an Application in regard to an execution of Decree is the date of
Appellate Court's Decree and not the date of Trial Court Decree as per
decision in 'Baba Balbir Singh vs Ram Kishan Chela Budh Dass And Ors \- AIR
2003 PH 250'.
69\. Undoubtedly, a plea of Limitation cannot be determined as an abstract
principle of Law divorced from facts. The question of Limitation is an mixed
issue of 'Fact and Law'. In fact, 'Limitation bars remedy and does not destroy
a right'.
70\. It appears that the Hon'ble Supreme Court had stayed the proceedings in
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2014 vide order dated 12.02.2018 in
Civil Appeal No.8974 of 2014. As far as the instant Compensation Application
(AT) No.01 of 2019 is concerned, the Compensation Application is perfectly
maintainable because of the reason that Section 53N(1) of the Act visualises
that a compensation claim must 'arise from the findings of the Competition
Commission of India or the Appellate Tribunal', which means that 'cause of
action' for the compensation claim is to arise because of an order either of
the Competition Commission of India or the Appellate Tribunal. In the
considered opinion of this Tribunal, the ultimate proceedings ended in Hon'ble
Supreme Court on 08.05.2017 and that the Compensation Application was filed by
the Applicant on 11.07.2019, within the period of two years two months and the
same having been filed within a reasonable Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 39 of 47 period of
time, i.e., less than three years. Therefore, the Applicant cannot be blamed
for any laches. In fact, the plea of laches cannot be put against the
Applicant by any means. If one is to reckon the period of limitation from the
date of Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment of 08.05.2017 in the present case, then
the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 having been filed by the
Applicant on 11.07.2019 is not hit by the plea of limitation.
71\. To put it differently, when the order of COMPAT dated 29.10.2013 was
under challenge before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in appeal proceedings and
when the original order of CCI dated 23.04.2012, which was affirmed by COMPAT
on 29.10.2013 and finally the same attained finality with the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Appeal on 08.05.2017, it is crystal clear that the
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 (being a money claim) filed on
11.07.2019 (in the absence of any fixed time limit) is well within a
reasonable period of three years' time and no laches can be attributed on the
part of the Applicant in this regard.
72\. Coming to the aspect of the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019
being filed against the Respondents claiming compensation in a single
application, against all the three enterprises, it is to be pointed out that
Section 53N, no doubt speaks of filing of an application by Central Government
or State Government or a 'Local Authority' or any enterprise or any person to
make an application to the Appellate Tribunal to adjudicate on claim for
compensation that may arise from the findings of Compensation Application (AT)
No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 40 of 47 the
Commission or under Section 42-A or under sub-section (2) of Section 53-Q of
the Act and to pass order for the recovery of compensation from any enterprise
for any loss or damage shown to have been suffered etc., inasmuch as the
'cause of action' involved in the present 'lis' relates to the common orders
passed by the Competition Commission of India, COMPAT and the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, it can safely and squarely be said that 'litigation' involved in these
orders was common and viewed in that perspective, the filing of single
application viz, the present Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 is
not fatal and to put it more precisely, the said Application is maintainable
in Law.
73\. In regard to the plea taken that on the cover page and in the heading of
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019, the Applicant claims that the
present Compensation Application has arisen out of the Competition Appeal (AT)
Nos.79-81 of 2012, which was finally disposed of by the COMPAT on 29.10.2013
and in the body of the Compensation Application, the Applicant repeatedly
mentions that it 'arises out of order dated 08.05.2017 of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court' and at other places the Applicant has mentioned that it is relying on
the order of the CCI and, therefore, the Applicant has not approached this
Tribunal with 'clean hands', this Tribunal on going through the Application is
of the considered view that the same is not a serious mistake that goes to the
root of the matter. In fact, the term 'cause of action' is a bundle of facts
and the Applicant having mentioned in its Compensation Application at
paragraph 5 that the compensation claim was filed under Section 53N of the Act
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 41 of 47 arising out of order dated 08.05.2017 of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India read with findings of the Hon'ble Commission
dated 23.04.2012. In fact, as against the COMPAT order dated 29.10.2013, the
three Respondents had filed Civil Appeal Nos.2480, 2874 and 2922 of 2014
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and that the Hon'ble Commission had also
filed appeal before the Hon'ble Apex Court against the order dated 29.10.2013
through Civil Appeal No.53-55 of 2014 praying that penalty was to be imposed
on the entire 'turn over' of Respondents. Viewed from any angle, the Applicant
being public Body and claiming compensation from the Respondents cannot be
said by any stretch of imagination that they have approached this Tribunal
with 'unclean hands'.
74\. It transpires that the Applicant in Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 had paid fee of Rupees three lakhs in regard to its claim for
compensation from the Respondents. At this juncture, it is useful for this
Tribunal to make a relevant mention of Rule 4 of the Competition Appellate
Tribunal (Form and Fee for Filing an Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation
Applications) Rules, 2009, which reads as under: -
> "4. Fee. - (1) Every memorandum of appeal and compensation application shall
> be accompanied with a fee provided in sub-rule(2) and such fee may be
> remitted in the form of demand draft drawn in favour of Pay and Accounts
> Officer, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, payable at New Delhi.

> 2\. Twenty thousand or : Rs.2,500 more rupees but less than one lakh
> 3\. One lakh or more : Rs.2,500 plus Rs.1,000 for every rupees additional

           1.      Less than one lakh         :      Rs.1,000
                   rupees
           2.      More than one lakh         :      Rs.1,000 plus Rs.1,000 for every

                                                     compensation claimed or fraction
                                                     thereof, subject to a maximum of
                                                     Rs.3,00,000.
> (ii) Amount of fee payable in respect of any other appeal against a

> reasons to be recorded.
> (4) The Central Government may review the fee under rule 4 after every two
> years and the fee may be amended by a notification."
75\. The Applicant being a 'public Body' for it, the payment of fee under
Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT)
No.79-81 of 2012 Page 43 of 47 Rule 4(3) of Competition Appellate Tribunal
(Form and Fee for Filing an Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation
Applications) Rules, 2009 cannot be waived and it has to necessarily pay the
requisite fee as per aforesaid Rules 2009. Although, the Applicant has filed a
single Application for recovery of compensation against the three Respondents,
it appears that the payment of fees of Rupees three lakhs paid by the
Applicant/ FCI is to be scrutinised and examined by the 'Office of the
Registry of this Tribunal' because of the fact that the Respondents had taken
a plea that the said payment of Rupees three lakhs towards fees is not in
accordance with Rule 4 of the Competition Appellate Tribunal (Form and Fee for
Filing an Appeal and Fee for Filing Compensation Applications) Rules, 2009.
For 'deficit payment of necessary filing fee' under any Rule or for that
matter any deficit Court fees either before a Tribunal or a Court of Law, an
Application cannot be rejected or being thrown out at the threshold and an
'opportunity' necessarily has to be provided to the concerned Applicant to
rectify/cure the defect pertaining to the said deficit filing fee/Court fee,
as the case may be, in the considered opinion of this Tribunal. Hence, if the
Office of the Registry finds that the Applicant/ FCI is to make good the
deficit filing fee in regard to the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of
2019, then the Office of the Registry shall issue an Office Memorandum to the
Applicant/ FCI, requiring it to pay the said sum within 14 days from the date
of receipt of such Memorandum. On such receipt of the said Memorandum, the
Applicant/FCI shall pay the necessary fees. Resultantly, if any amendment is
to be carried out by the Applicant in the Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012 Page 44 of 47 Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 at relevant paragraph, the same may be carried
out by through Learned Counsel for the Applicant within one week thereafter
and the amended copy of the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 (if
required) may be filed before the Office of the Registry by the Applicant
side, by serving advance copy to the Respondents' side.
76\. In view of the foregoing qualitative and quantitative upshot of
discussions and also this Tribunal taking into account of all the facts and
circumstances of the present case in a conspectus fashion, comes to a
resultant conclusion that in the present case, the 'cause of action' firstly
arose from the decision of the CCI's order dated 23.04.2012, which was later
affirmed by the COMPAT on 29.10.2013 and attained finality by means of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment dated 08.05.2017 (Civil Appeal No.2480 of 2014,
with Civil Appeal Nos. 53-55 of 2004, Civil Appeal No.2874 of 2014 and Civil
Appeal No 2922 of 2014) and also this Tribunal taking note of yet another fact
that the Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 was filed on 11.07.2019
(within two years and two months from 08.05.2017) of Hon'ble Supreme Court
judgment, the said Application having been filed within less than three years'
reasonable period (especially when the Competition Act, 2002 does not speak of
limitation period for filing of an application under Section 53N of the Act),
the said application is perfectly maintainable in Law, under Section 53N of
the Act. As such, the contra plea taken by the Respondents that a Compensation
Application is only permissible against a CCI order or Compensation
Application (AT) No.01 of 2019 in Competition Appeal (AT) No.79-81 of 2012
Page 45 of 47 COMPAT's order and not against the Supreme Court judgment is not
acceded to.
77\. In regard to the plea of the 2nd Respondent that the Limitation period of
three years came to an end on 28.10.2016 (after the order of COMPAT on
29.10.2013) as per Sch 1 of Art. 137 of Limitation Act, 1963 is incorrect
because of the fact that as against the COMPAT order dated 29.10.2013, the
matter was taken to Hon'ble Supreme Court and ultimately the Hon'ble Supreme
Court delivered its judgments on 08.05.2017. Till the time the decision was
rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court probity and propriety require that one
has to wait for the final determination of controversies (involving lis) by
the Hon'ble Apex Court, relating to the parties. Suffice it for this Tribunal
to point out that the Limitation period will commence only after the final
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in so far as the present case is
concerned. Moreover, this Tribunal holds that Section 53N of the Competition
Act, 2002 entail an Applicant's 'cause of action' to have come into existence
because of an order of the Competition Commission of India or the Competition
Appellate Tribunal. Further, it cannot be lost sight of that in the instant
case, the Competition Commission of India, erstwhile COMPAT and the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had found that the Respondents had violated the Competition Act.
Viewed from the aforesaid perspectives, this Tribunal, answers the issue of
maintainability of Compensation Application (AT) No.01 of 2019. Compensation

78\. The Registry is directed to list the Compensation Application (AT) No.01
of 2019 for hearing of the matter on merits in respect of other issues in
usual course.
79\. I.A. 40 of 2019 filed by the Applicant seeking exemption to file original
circular dated 13.03.2006 (declaring the Applicant's authorized Signatories)
is allowed. However, the Applicant is directed to file the certified copy of
the original Circular Dated 13.03.2006 as well as the certified copy of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 08.05.2017 in Civil Appeal No.2480
of 2014 etc. within 10 days from today.
