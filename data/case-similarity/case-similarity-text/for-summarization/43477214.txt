             IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY
                         BENCH AT AURANGABAD
                              Appeal from Order No.111 of 2015
             1)      Shri. Swami Samarth Agencies,
                     Through its Proprietor
                     Ratnakar S/o. Madhav Wani,

                     Age Major, Occu: Business,
manufacture and sell such substance. No strong prima facie case is made out by
the plaintiff for getting relief of temporary injunction. It appears that the
trial Court had granted ex parte relief on the basis of aforesaid contentions
even when there was no record with the plaintiff to show the loss sustained by
him and to make out the case of deceptive similarity. In view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present case, this Court holds that  :::

of 2015 no relief of temporary injunction can be granted in favour of the
plaintiff. In the result, following order :-
31) The appeal is allowed. The order made by the trial Court on temporary
injunction application is set aside. The application is rejected. Interim
relief is vacated.
Civil Applications are disposed of.
32) The learned counsel for original plaintiff submitted that interim relief
has been in existence for about five months and he wants to challenge the
decision of this Court. He wants extension of interim relief.

> 3 AO 111 of 2015 Initially ex-parte order of temporary injunction was made
> and it is confirmed on merits, after hearing both sides.
3) The suit is filed by present respondent under section 134(2) of the Trade
Marks Act 1999 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). The plaintiff is a
manufacturer of chemical substance, Sodium Hypochlorite Solution.
This substance can be used as drinking water disinfectant.
It is the case of the plaintiff that it is in the business of manufacturing
and marketing of this substance for more than two decades. It is contended
that in the month of August 1996 the plaintiff conceptualized and adopted the
trade mark "JEEVANDROP". It is contended that application for registration of
the trade mark was made on 30-8-1996 in Class 5 of the goods of the Act and
the trade mark has been registered.
4) It is the case of the plaintiff that it has been using the word
"JEEVANDROP" as trade mark and it is also using artistic logo having this
word. The plaintiff has given the picture of logo in the plaint. It is the
case of the plaintiff that it has been selling the aforesaid product in  :::
Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 4 AO 111
of 2015 bottles in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa since more than 2 decades.
5) It is the case of the plaintiff that under the agreement deed dated
29-5-2012 it had appointed defendant No.2, Shri. Swami Samarth Agencies, as
its sole distributor for Maharashtra region. It is contended that this
agreement came to an end on 29-5-2014. It is contended that the plaintiff has
spent huge amount on the publicity of the aforesaid brand name. It is the case
of the plaintiff that defendants have no right to use the aforesaid trade mark
or similar trade mark in view of the reputation and good will earned by the
plaintiff.
6) It is the case of the plaintiff that in the month of October 2014 the
plaintiff came across an application made by the wife of defendant No.2, Smt.
Jyoti Wani for registration of trade mark "JALDROP" in class 5 and so the
plaintiff took objection to the registration and gave notice to the said lady
about the objection. It is contended that initially Smt. Jyoti contended that
logo was created by her and it was her design but subsequently she withdrew
the application.

                                                   5                      AO 111 of 2015
             7)               It is the case of the plaintiff that in the month of
March 2015 it came across a product of defendant No.1 in the market by name
"JALDROP" and he noticed that the label of the bottle was similar to the label
of the plaintiff 's brand "JEEWANDROP". It is contended that as per
information of the plaintiff, defendant No.3 has applied for registration of
trade mark "JALDROP" in Class 5 and this trade mark is deceptively similar to
the trade mark "JEEVANDROP" of the plaintiff. It is contended that the
defendant Nos.2 and 3 are marketing the product "JALDROP" of defendant No.1
and they are acting together. Defendant No.2 Ratnakar is said to be a cousin
brother of defendant No.3 Smt. Seema.
8) With the plaint, plaintiff has produced specimen labels of his own product
and the product of defendant No.1. It is the case of the plaintiff that there
is infringement of his trade mark "JEEVANDROP" due to the use of trade mark
"JALDROP" and it is substantially similar to the trade mark of plaintiff. It
is contended that by adopting the trade mark "JALDROP" with dishonest
intention defendants want to deceive the people and they  ::: Uploaded on -
15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 6 AO 111 of 2015 want
to make the people believe that "JALDROP" product is also a product of
plaintiff. It is contended that the defendants are trying to trade upon the
reputation and good will of plaintiff by using such deceptive trade mark.
9) It is the case of the plaintiff that in the past, defendant No.2 was
distributor of the plaintiff and he has misused his ig position by passing off
the product "JALDROP" as the product of the plaintiff. It is the case of the
plaintiff that he has not consented for using trade mark "JALDROP" by the
defendants. In the suit, relief of injunction is claimed on the basis of
registration of trade mark "JEEVANDROP" and another relief is claimed to
prevent the defendants from passing off their goods as that of the plaintiff.
Damages of rupees one lac are also claimed.
10) Defendant Nos.1 to 3 filed joint written statement. Amongst other
contentions they have made following specific contentions in the written
statement and also in the say offered to Exhibit 5 :-
::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 :::
                                                     7                     AO 111 of 2015
             (I)     That, the word "JEEVAN" used by the plaintiff is
descriptive in nature and it has dictionary meaning and it is the word used
for water disinfectant. That, the word "DROP" is used as drops of chemical
which act as disinfectant and the name and description signifies the purpose
for which the product is to be used.
(II) That, till the year 2004 the plaintiff had not used this trade mark and
that can be seen from the journal published in the year 2004 where the
plaintiff has mentioned that it proposes to use the aforesaid trade mark.
(III) that the word "JEEWANDROP" does not involve innovation and it is
combination of dictionary words.
(IV) That, only the word "JEEWANDROP" is registered as trade mark and no
artistic logo as such or device of drop in the background is registered as
trade mark and so the trade mark of the defendants is distinctively different.
(V) That the defendant No.3 has applied for registration of trade mark
"JALDROP" both as word and also device with two different logos. Two different
logos having such word marks are submitted for registration and those marks
are assigned to defendant No.2 by defendant No.3 under a deed of assignment
dated 4-8-2012 and the Deeds are submitted in the office of the Registrar
under the Act. Thus the words and the logos are not similar to the registered
trade mark of the plaintiff and they are not likely to create confusion in the
minds of purchasers of any kind.

                                                 8                     AO 111 of 2015
             (VI)    that due to difference in the trade marks and also other
things about the goods of defendant there is no question of passing off the
goods of the defendants as the goods of the plaintiff.
(VII) that the defendant No.2 has his own network of distribution though he
had worked as sole distributor of the plaintiff. Defendant No.2 had used his
own network and he had spent on publicity and he had taken initiative for
increase of the sale of the product of the plaintiff. When the agreement
between the plaintiff and defendant No.2 came to an end, the plaintiff did not
extend the contract and then defendant No.2 took steps to introduce such
product under the name of "JALDROP" as there was demand for such product in
the market. Due to the sale of the product of the defendants there is
possibility that the sales of the plaintiff are affected but this is not due
to the passing off the goods of the defendants as the goods of plaintiff. Due
to increase in sale of product of the defendant, plaintiff is frustrated and
he has taken the steps like filing the suit against the defendants to prevent
them from selling their product.
11) The defendants have admitted in their written statement that Jyoti Wani
had applied for registration of trade mark but it is described as "Su Jeevan
Drop". It is their case that when the plaintiff filed objection, there was
settlement between the parties and then Jyoti withdrew her application filed
for registration.

             12)                It is the case of the defendants that they are
manufacturing and selling sodium hypochlorite solution under the name and
trade mark "JALDROP". It is their contention that their trade mark is totally
different in words, in colour combination and in the material mentioned on the
label. It is contended that the adoption of the trade mark by the defendants
is honest and their trade mark is original and it is conceived by defendant
No.3. The defendants have given points of differences between their trade mark
and the trade mark of the plaintiff in the written statement.
13) On the basis of physical verification of the bottles of the plaintiff and
the defendants, the trial Court observed that the size, shape etc. of the
bottles are similar. It is observed that the colours of the bottles are
exactly similar and the manner in which the words are printed on the labels
are similar. The trial Court has observed that the defendants have attempted
to make little bit difference in design, the logo and the background colour
but due to such difference the overall similarity is not removed and there is
intention to deceive. The  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on -
31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 10 AO 111 of 2015 circumstance that in the past wife
of defendant No.2 had attempted to register similar trade mark is considered
against the defendants. It is held by the trial Court that the plaintiff has
already earned reputation and good will in the market by using the trade mark
"JEEVANDROP"
and it is observed that the defendants are trying to cause harm to this
reputation and good will.
14) From the pleadings in the plaint and the reliefs claimed it can be said
that the action of the plaintiff is for infringement of registered trade mark
and also for passing off the goods by defendant by using the trade mark and
label which, according the plaintiff, are deceptively similar to that of the
plaintiff. It is not disputed that there is identity of goods. In the written
statement, the defendants have admitted that in the past the defendant No.2
was the sole distributor of the plaintiff for Maharashtra region. It is also
not disputed that sales of the plaintiff must have come down due to
introduction of the similar product by the defendants in the market. In view
of these circumstances, the provisions of sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Act
need to be used. Relevant parts of  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 :::

16) The cases on which reliance was placed by both the sides are mostly on the
provisions of the Trade Marks  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on
- 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 14 AO 111 of 2015 Act 1958. Not much change has
taken place in the provisions of this old Act due to introduction of the Act
of 1999\. It can be said that in view of the interpretation of the terms,
definitions done by the Hon'ble Apex Court the definitions are made more
illustrative and exhaustive in the new Act. Provision of section 29 of the new
Act is more exhaustive in nature than the old section and it illustrates as to
how there may be infringement of registered trade mark.
17) In the case of Parle Product (cited supra) the Apex Court has quoted and
considered the observations made by it in previous case reported as AIR 1965
SC 980 (Durga Dutt v. Navratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories) .
The observations are in para 7 of the report and they are as under :-
> "While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance
> an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as
> those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The
> action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered
> proprietor of registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive
> right to the trade mark in relation to those good (vide Section 21 of the
> Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not
> essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case
> of an action for infringement."
::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 :::
> 15 AO 111 of 2015 "In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
> doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive,
> but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is
> so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches
> the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required
> to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another
> way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
> adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other
> writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods
> for sale show marked differences or indicate clearly a trade origin
> different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
> immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape
> liability or he can show the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his
> goods from those of the plaintiff."
18) The case of Heinz Italia v. Dabur India (cited supra) involved use of both
the Trade Mark Act and Copy Right Act and facts of the reported case were more
clear and different. In the present matter product is different and due to its
nature, different approach is required.
19) In the case of Ramdev Food Products (cited supra) the Apex Court has
quoted and considered the law on passing off at paragraphs 88 to 90 and those
are as under :-
> "ESSENCE OF PASSING OFF ACTION
> 88\. In a case of this nature, the test for determination of the dispute
> would be the same where a cause of action for passing off arises. The
> deceptively similar test, thus, would be applicable herein.
::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 :::
> 16 AO 111 of 2015
> 89\. The doctrine of passing off is a common law remedy whereby a person is
> prevented from trying to wrongfully utilise the reputation and goodwill of
> another by trying to deceive the public through 'passing off' his goods.
> 90\. In Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names' Supplement pages 42 and
> 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated as under:-
> "The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general proposition
> no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may

20) The observations made by the Apex Court in the cases cited supra show that
few basic things need to be established for getting the relief which the
plaintiff wants. If provision of section 29(2) of the Act is compared  :::
Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 17 AO 111
of 2015 with the definition of term "deceptively similar" given in section
2(h) of the Act, it can be said that the definition itself is incorporated in
section 29(2) of the Act in effect.
The definition given in section 2(h) runs as under :
> "2. (h)"deceptively similar",-- A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively
> similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be
> likely to deceive or cause confusion".
21) The definition shows that the trade mark if it is the word it should be so
nearly resembling to the trade mark of defendant that possibility of deception
or causing confusion in the mind of purchaser is created.
22) The question whether the word mark used by the plaintiff and the
defendants nearly resemble or they do not resemble cannot be answered by
generalizing the things. The approach needs to be different for different
kinds of goods. In the case reported as AIR 1982 Delhi 308 (Essco Sanitations
v. Mascot Industries) the factors which can be considered to determine whether
particular trade mark is deceptively similar to another trade mark or not, are
enumerated and they are as under :-
::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 :::
                                                 18                      AO 111 of 2015
             (i)     the nature of marks;
(ii) the degree of resemblance between the marks (phonetic, visual as well as
similarity in idea);
(iii) the nature of goods in respect of which they are used or likely to be
used as trade marks;
(iv) the similarity in the nature, character and purpose of the goods of the
rival traders;
(v) the class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks,
their level of eduction and intelligence, and the degree of care they are
likely to exercise in purchasing the goods;
(vi) the mode of purchase of the goods or placing orders for the goods; and,
(vii) any other surrounding circumstances.
23) There cannot be uniform criteria, factors and so each case needs to be
decided on the basis of facts and circumstances of that case. In the case
reported as 1969 (2) SCC 716 (F. H. Roche And Co. v. G. Manner And Co.) on
which reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the appellants, question
had arisen as to whether the word "Dropovit" was deceptively similar to the
word "Protovit". It was held that there was no similarity between two words.
It was held that terminal syllable "VIT" was both descriptive and common in
the trade and it appears in almost all vitamin preparations. It was held  :::
Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 19 AO 111
of 2015 that the word "Dropovit" can be treated as invented word because this
word is not descriptive if considered in entirety. It was held that there was
difference in the pronunciation of the aforesaid two words and so they were
wholly dissimilar.
24) The word "JEEWANDROP" from the present matter can be dissected in two
parts viz. "Jeevan" and "drop". "Jeevan" is dictionary word used both in
Marathi and Hindi and its meaning is "life" for both Marathi and Hindi
language. The word "drop" is also dictionary word though in English and it is
used to describe small portion of liquid (not necessarily water). On the other
hand, the word "JALDROP" can be dissected in two parties viz "Jal"
and "drop". The word "Jal" is dictionary word for both Marathi and Hindi
language and its meaning is water.
Thus there is no similarity in the two words like "Jal" and "Jeevan" in
appearance, in pronunciation or in meaning.
25) In the present matter record is produced by the appellants to the effect
that the word "Jeevan" has been used separately and also in combination with
other  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27
::: 20 AO 111 of 2015 words including English word for many years in class 5
of the goods. Recently for similar product of water disinfectant, trade mark
is registered as "NIRMAL JIVAN DROPS DRINKING WATER DISINFECTANT". This
application was made by the proprietor of this trade mark on 19-5-2011 though
it was registered in the year 2015. It is registered as water disinfectant and
in the background of the words there are drops falling in pool of water.
26) Both the plaintiff and defendants are selling chemical substance (Sodium
Hypochlorite Solution). They have not invented this substance and they are not
claiming that they have discovered the property like "disinfectant". They
claim to be manufacturer but anybody can manufacture and market such chemical
substance by giving own name to the substance and by describing it as water
disinfectant. The manner of use of the substance is also not different as few
drops of this substance are required to be used as disinfectant for particular
quantity of water.
::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 :::
                                                 21                      AO 111 of 2015
             27)              For the purpose of proving the infringement of
registered trade mark, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that there
is over all similarity. It can be said that there are more dissimilarities
than the similarities. Idea behind the two products may be the same but that
cannot make much difference in the matters involving such substance.
28) If the bottles of the plaintiff and the defendant are seen one after the
other, it can be said that the bottles of the defendants are appearing sky
blue in colour due to colour used on the labels. Bottles of the plaintiff are
appearing white. On the bottles of the plaintiff the word 'JEEVANDROP" is used
in English in blue colour and the word is overlapped by device, a drop of
water. On the other hand, the defendant has used the drop of water as alphabet
"O" in the word "drop". This drop is appearing as falling in pool of water. No
such pool of water is in existence on the label of the plaintiff. The
plaintiff has described the substance as "Drinking Water Disinfectant"
and the defendant has described the substance as "Unique Water Disinfectant".
On the bottles of the plaintiff there is  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 :::
Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 22 AO 111 of 2015 a blue colour strip
at bottom and on it the aforesaid description of the substance is written but
such strip has green colour on the bottles of the defendants. Names of
manufacturers are different and on the bottles of the defendant the name of
agency marketing the product is also there when there is no such name on the
bottles of the plaintiff. Manufacturer of the bottle of plaintiff is shown
from Newasa (Maharashtra) and the manufacturer of the defendant is shown from
Ahmedabad (Gujarat).
Trade mark of the plaintiff is shown as registered by mark "R". As against the
trade mark of the defendant, the words "TM" are written to show that the trade
mark is under process of registration. The bottles of the defendant show that
there is certification obtained of ISO and its number is written on the
bottles of the defendant. No such certificate is obtained by the plaintiff.
Only on one bottle of the defendant, which was shown to be manufactured on
31-12-2014, there is blue strip at the bottom over which the description of
the substance is given and on this bottle the word "JALDROP" was written in
blue colour when on other bottles this word is written in red colour by the
defendant. In the para of cause of action of the plaint, the  ::: Uploaded on
- 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 23 AO 111 of 2015
plaintiff has contended that he learnt about the product of the defendant in
March 2015 and cash memo of a bottle of year 2015 is produced by plaintiff.
Learned counsel appearing for the defendants made submission that the
defendants are not manufacturing or marketing the bottles like the bottle
shown to be manufactured on 31-12-
2014\. Written undertaking is also filed in that regard.
When plaintiff has registered the word "JEEVANDROP" as trade mark and it is
not as a devise and when there are aforesaid circumstances, it is not possible
to infer that there is infringement of the registered trade mark of the
plaintiff.
29) In view of the law already quoted, the defence of difference in trade mark
is more forceful in passing off action. The defendant has shown that the
matter on his label is different from the matter appearing on the label of the
plaintiff. It is already observed that appearance of the bottle of the
defendant is different and the appearance is sufficient to distinguish the
goods of the defendant from the goods of the plaintiff. Further for giving the
relief in action of passing off, misrepresentation needs to be made  :::
Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 24 AO 111
of 2015 out by the plaintiff. The aforesaid circumstances do not make out the
case of calculated misrepresentation. It is already observed that a simple
chemical substance is being sold by both sides by giving different names. The
aforesaid circumstances show that the defendants have their own network of
distribution and sale when on the bottles of the plaintiff even name of
distributor is absent.
In such a case, prospective purchaser is not illiterate person. The customer
would purchase the chemical substance, sodium hydrochloride solution as it is
to be used as drinking water disinfectant. Like ALAM or potassium permanganate
such substance can be ordered.
The name of the manufacturer or even distributor would not make much
difference for the purchaser. Thus, there is no requirement of possibility of
misrepresentation for selling such product.
30) The learned counsel for the plaintiff, respondent submitted that the trial
Court has used the discretion and so it is not desirable for the appellate
Court to interfere in such order. This submission is not acceptable in the
present case as the trial Court has not  ::: Uploaded on - 15/02/2016 :::
Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 04:13:27 ::: 25 AO 111 of 2015 considered the
aforesaid peculiar circumstances of the present matter. This Court holds that
interference is warranted in the present matter. Granting of temporary
injunction in such case is serious matter and it prevents the manufacturer
from manufacturing the substance and from marketing it. Such action comes in
the way of fair competition. It appears that the trial Court was influenced
due to circumstance like registration of trade mark by plaintiff and the
circumstance that in the past defendant No.2 was working as distributor in
respect of the same product of the plaintiff. There is clear possibility that
the plaintiff has got frustrated as his sale must have come down after removal
of defendant No.2 from his own business. The defendants have every right to
manufacture and sell such substance. No strong prima facie case is made out by
the plaintiff for getting relief of temporary injunction. It appears that the
trial Court had granted ex parte relief on the basis of aforesaid contentions
even when there was no record with the plaintiff to show the loss sustained by
him and to make out the case of deceptive similarity. In view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present case, this Court holds that  :::

of 2015 no relief of temporary injunction can be granted in favour of the

             JUDGMENT:
manufacture and sell such substance. No strong prima facie case is made out by
the plaintiff for getting relief of temporary injunction. It appears that the
trial Court had granted ex parte relief on the basis of aforesaid contentions
even when there was no record with the plaintiff to show the loss sustained by
him and to make out the case of deceptive similarity. In view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present case, this Court holds that  :::
