    BRIEF FACTS/ STATEMENT OF THE REASONS FOR THE DECISION:-
    1.
Accused Sushil Kumar Gupta, Naresh Kumar Jain and Kishan Chand were sent for
trial on the allegations that the accused persons were found having possession
of spurious castrol grease and oils in contravention of Class -III & IV of The
Lubricating Oils and Greases (Processing, Supply & Distribution Regulation
Order), 1987 and further for offences punishable U/s 78/79 of Trade &
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. As per the case of the prosecution on 01.02.1997
at about 4.00 pm from the godown at Samai Pur Badli & Shop No.2 Bawana Road of
accused Sushil Kumar FIR No. 75/1997 Page 2 to 7  3 Gupta various oils & oil
products bearing brand name of Castrol were recovered. Whereas on 03.02.1997
various oils & oil products bearing Castrol Marks were recovered from the
possession of Naresh Kumar Jain. It was also alleged that castrol oil products
in contravention to provisions of Trade & Merchandise Marks Act were recovered
on 03.02.1997 from the possession of Kishan Chand at the instance of accused
Sushil Kumar.
2\. After completion of the investigation, charge sheet was filed by Crime
Branch against Sushil Kumar Gupta, Naresh Kumar Jain and Kishan Chand for the
offences U/s 7 of Essential Commodities Act, 1955, 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 &
U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It was reported that
accused Kishan Chand had expired, therefore, the proceedings against him were
abated. Copies of charge sheet & documents were supplied to both the remaining
accused persons free of costs and charge U/s 7 of Essential Commodities Act,
1955 & U/s 78/79 of Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was framed against
both the accused persons to which they had pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial.
3\. In order to prove the case the prosecution has examined in all five
witnesses.
Complainant Sh. Ram Hingorani was examined as PW1. SI Satish was examined as
PW2, HC Rajbir Singh was examined as a third witness, however, he was
inadvertently examined as PW2, Insp. O.P. Arora was examined as PW3 and Sh.
V.S. Raghvan, Chief Chemist Quality Control from Castrol India Ltd. was
examined as PW4. The remaining prosecution witnesses as cited in the charge
sheet were not produced despite numerous opportunities granted to the
prosecution. Prosecution Evidence was accordingly closed on 05.05.2010.
4\. Both the accused persons were examined U/s 313 Cr.PC in which both the
accused persons denied all the material incriminating evidence on record
against them and stated that they are innocent and have been falsely
implicated in this case. Both the accused persons have preferred not to lead
any defence evidence.
As mentioned above, the proceedings against accused Kishan Chand have been
abated vide order dated 05.01.2001.
FIR No. 75/1997 Page 3 to 7  4
5\. I have heard the final arguments and carefully perused the record.
6\. As mentioned above, the prosecution in support of its case has examined
total five witnesses. PW1 is the complainant Sh. Ram Hingorani who was
authorised representative of Castrol India Limited. He has proved complaint
Ex.PW-1/A. He deposed that in pursuance to his complaint police had conducted
raid on 01.02.1997 at about 4.00 pm at Shop No. 2 Bawana Road. He further
deposed that accused Sushil Kumar Gupta Proprietor of M/s. Gupta Oil Traders
was present at the said shop from where a huge quantity of spurious lubricants
bearing castrol label were recovered. The witness has also deposed that after
conducting raid at the shop of Sushil Kumar Gupta his godown was also raided
at Gali No. 15 Bawana from where more spurious lubricants were recovered. He
proved the seizure memo as Ex.PW-1/B. Complainant further adduced that on the
disclosure of Sushil Kumar Gupta raid was conducted at Shop No. 72 Rajinder
Markset from where Kishan Chand (Since deceased) was found having possession
of spurious castrol lubricants in his shop which was seized vide memo
Ex.PW-1/D. PW-1 deposed that raid was also conducted at Bajrang Bali Oil
Company, Manohar Park, Punjabi Bagh, from where spurious lubricants were
recovered from the possession of Naresh Kumar which were seized vide memo
Ex.PW-1/E. The witness had proved the recovered spurious castrol lubricants
products & lubricants as Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-3 and had stated that these materials
were infringed one and were having falsified trade Marks & copy right of
Castrol Company. He had identified Naresh Kumar and Sushil Kumar Gupta and had
also proved trade Marks certificate in the favour of Castrol India Limited.
The witness was cross-examined on behalf of the accused persons. In his cross-
examination he had admitted that the case property produced in the court was
barely empty drums and were in unsealed condition. He has also admitted that
there is possibility that police might have produced some other drums. PW-2 is
SI Satish Kumar who as per record was partly examined- in-chief on 20.12.2001
and his further examination was deferred for want of case property. However,
PW-2 did not appear again for completion of his testimony and thus the accused
did not get any opportunity for his cross-examination. Therefore, part FIR No.
75/1997 Page 4 to 7  5 examination-in-chief of PW-2 as recorded on 20.12.2001
cannot be read at all either in favour of prosecution or against the accused
persons Third witness is HC Rajbir Singh, Duty Officer, who was also examined
as PW-2. He has proved the FIR as Ex.PW-2/A. PW-3 is Insp. O.P. Arora whose
examination was also deferred, therefore, his incomplete statement cannot be
read in evidence. PW-4 is Mr. V.S. Raghvan who was working as Chief Chemist
Quality Control with Castrol India Limited, Northeren Region, Ballabgarh
Plant. He has deposed that samples in the present case were examined by Mr.
A.K. Ghatak and were found spurious. He has proved the examination reports as
Ex.PW-4/A1 to Ex.PW-4/A13. This witness was cross-examined on behalf of the
accused persons and inter alia deposed that he was paid salary by Castrol
India Ltd.
7\. I have carefully perused the evidence produced by prosecution and has gone
through all the material on record. Both the accused persons have been sent
for trial for offences U/s 7 of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 & 78/79 of The
Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. In order to prove the offence U/s 7 of
Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the provisions of Rule 3 & 4 of The
Lubricating Oils & Greases (Processing, Supply & Distribution Regulation)
Order, 1987, (here-in-after referred as Order) are to be read along with
Section 3 & 7 of Essential Commodities Act. As per Rule 3 of the said order no
person is authorized to carry on business of a processor except under & in
accordance with the terms & conditions of valid licence granted to him under
this order. Whereas Rule 4 prohibits carrying of business of manufacturing,
blending, packaging, re-refining, selling or transporting for sale any
lubricating oil or grease which has been adulterated. Schedule -II appended
with the said order enumerates the designated laboratories for testing of
petroleum products samples. Perusal of the enlisted designated laboratories
clearly shows that Castrol India Lab. was not one of those laboratories from
where the samples of lubricants would have been got tested as has been done in
the present case. PW-1 though have claimed himself as Authorized
Representative of Castrol India Limited has not placed on record any
authorization letter authenticating his authority to act on behalf of Castrol
India FIR No. 75/1997 Page 5 to 7  6 Limited. Therefore, the charges against
the accused persons for the offence U/s 7 of Essential Commodities Act, 1955
fail on these counts. Even otherwise prosecution has failed to produce even an
iota of evidence showing that the accused persons were not the processors
within the definition of "Processor" vide Clause (c) of Section 2 of the said
Order. Prosecution has further failed to prove that the accused persons were
manufacturing, blending, packaging, re-refining, selling or transporting for
sale any adulterated lubricating oil or grease as required under Rules 4 of
the said Order. Prosecution has by way of uncorroborated testimony of PW-1 has
tried to prove possession of some spurious lubricants and oil products which
consequently were produced in the form of empty drums during the examination
of PW-1. Obviously, the edifice of the prosecution case is based upon the
factum of recovery of spurious castrol lubricants. Prosecution has failed to
produce this core fact in terms of both quantity & quality. Neither the case
property has been properly proved nor the quality of the alleged recovered
material has been proved to be spurious beyond reasonable doubt.
8\. While adverting to the offence U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks
Act, 1958 against the accused persons, it is observed that prosecution has
failed to prove that the recovered material from the accused persons was
bearing infringed trade Marks of Castrol India Limited. The only material
available on record to this effect is the uncorroborated oral testimony of
PW-1 who has simply stated that the recovered lubricants and grease products
were bearing infringed trade Marks. Their is no report proved on record
showing that the labels on the recovered lubricants/grease containers were
compared with the original and were found infringed. What it may be, the
prosecution has failed to prove the case property and has produced only empty
drums, therefore, the whole case of the prosecution for offences U/s 78/79 of
The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 stands unproved.
9\. As observed here-in-above that prosecution has failed to examine its
material witnesses despite numerous opportunities being granted to it for
completing its evidence. Eventually they remains only material testimony of
PW-1 on record which is highly insufficient to hold the accused persons guilty
of offences U/s 7 of Essential FIR No. 75/1997 Page 6 to 7  7 Commodities Act,
1955 & U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958
10\. Accordingly, in view of above said discussion, it is held that the
prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the allegations
against the accused persons, therefore, accused Sushil Kumar Gupta & Naresh
Kumar are acquitted in the present case U/s 7 of The Essential Commodities
Act, 1955 & U/s 78/79 of The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. Bail bonds
of both the accused persons are cancelled and their sureties are discharged.
File be consigned to record room.
