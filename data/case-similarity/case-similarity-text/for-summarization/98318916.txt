    CCE, Ghaziabad				 		Appellant
4\. We have considered the submissions of the ld. Joint CDR and gone through
the record on this case.
5\. The undisputed fact is that the service in question, which is alleged to
be the Consulting Engineer Service, had been provided during the period from
April, 2001 to August 31, 2004 to the respondent by an offshore service
provider-M/s.TAG, Germany, who do not have any business establishment or
office in India. The service tax is sought to be recovered from the respondent
as service recipient by invoking Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) of the Service Tax Rules,
1994. Honble Bombay High Court in the case of Indian National Ship Owners
Association (supra) held that notwithstanding the provisions of Rule
2(1)(d)(iv) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994, since the specific provision in
form of Section 66A providing for recovery of the service tax from the service
recipient in India in respect of a taxable service received from an offshore
service provider was introduced w.e.f. 18.04.2006 only, during the period
prior to 18.04.2006, the service tax on the services, in question, could not
be recovered from the respondent. In view of this, we hold that there is no

Honble Mr. Justice G. Raghuram, President Hon'ble Mr. Rakesh Kumar, Member
(Technical) Final Order no.52343/2014 /dated:15.05.2014 Rakesh Kumar:
The facts leading to filing of this appeal, in brief, are as under:-
1.1 The respondent are manufacturers of Anti Vibration Systems and its parts
falling under sub-heading 87099900 and 820700 of the Central Excise Tariff.
The respondent entered into an agreement with M/s. Trelleborg Automotive
Technical Centre, GMBH, Germany (hereinafter referred to as M/s. TAG for
obtaining technical knowhow from them for use in the manufacture of Anti
Vibration Systems and its parts. In terms of the collaboration agreement,
payments were to be made by the respondent to M/s.TAG for the said technical
knowhow. During the period from 2001-2002 to 31.8.2004, the respondent paid an
amount of Rs.1,90,26,534/- to M/s.TAG. The department was of the view that the
respondent have received taxable services of Consulting Engineers under
Section 65(105)(g) read with Section 65(31) of the Finance Act, 1994 and
hence, in terms of the provisions of Rule 2 (1)(d)(iv) of the Service Tax
Rules, 1994, the respondent, as recipient of the taxable service in India,
would be liable to pay service tax on the amount paid by them for receiving
the above services. On this basis, after issue of show cause notice, the
jurisdictional Addl. Commissioner passed an order-in-original dated 24.1.2008
by which, he confirmed the demand of duty of Rs.12,71,044/- against the
Respondent along with interest thereon under Section 71 of the Finance Act,
1994 and imposed penalty of equal amount on them under Section 78 ibid and
another penalty of Rs.500 on them under Section 75A of the Act. On appeal
being filed to the Commissioner (Appeals), the Commissioner (Appeals) vide
order-in-appeal dated 24.01.2008 set aside the Addl. Commissioners order
holding that the service received by the respondent is not the Consulting
Engineers service and in this regard, he relied upon the Tribunals decision
in the case of Turbo Energy Ltd. Vs. CCE, Chennai-III reported in 2006 (3) STR
78 (Tribunal-Chennai) and Navinon Ltd. Vs. CCE, Mumbai-IV reported in 2006 (3)
STR 396 (Tribunal-Mum.). Besides this, he also held that since the service had
been received during the period prior to 1.1.2005, in view of the judgement of
the Tribunal in the case of Ispat Industries reported in 2007 (8)STR 212
(Mum.), no service tax could be charged from the respondent as service
recipient, as notification no.36/2004-ST dated 30.12.2004 issued under Section
68(2) of the Finance Act, 1994, providing that in respect of the service
provided by an offshore/foreign service provider to a person in India, it is
the person receiving the service in India, who would be the person liable to
pay the service tax, became effective w.e.f. 1.1.2005 only. The Commissioner
(Appeals) also observed that the service provided by the respondent was
intellectual property tax, which became taxable w.e.f. 10.09.2004 and hence,
for this reason also, during the period of dispute i.e. during the period
prior to 10.07.2004, the IPR service received by the respondent was not
taxable. Against this order of the Commissioner (Appeals), this appeal has
been filed.
2\. Heard both the sides.
3\. Nobody appeared for the respondent, though a notice had been issued to
them. In view of this, accordance with the provisions of Rule 21 of the CESTAT
(Procedure) Rules, so far as the respondent are concerned, the matter is being
decided ex parte.
3\. Heard Shri Pramod Kumar, the learned Joint CDR, who assailed the impugned
order by reiterating the grounds of appeal in the Revenues appeal.
4\. We have considered the submissions of the ld. Joint CDR and gone through
the record on this case.
5\. The undisputed fact is that the service in question, which is alleged to
be the Consulting Engineer Service, had been provided during the period from
April, 2001 to August 31, 2004 to the respondent by an offshore service
provider-M/s.TAG, Germany, who do not have any business establishment or
office in India. The service tax is sought to be recovered from the respondent
as service recipient by invoking Rule 2(1)(d)(iv) of the Service Tax Rules,
1994. Honble Bombay High Court in the case of Indian National Ship Owners
Association (supra) held that notwithstanding the provisions of Rule
2(1)(d)(iv) of the Service Tax Rules, 1994, since the specific provision in
form of Section 66A providing for recovery of the service tax from the service
recipient in India in respect of a taxable service received from an offshore
service provider was introduced w.e.f. 18.04.2006 only, during the period
prior to 18.04.2006, the service tax on the services, in question, could not
be recovered from the respondent. In view of this, we hold that there is no
merit in the Revenues appeal. The same is dismissed.
