                                 ORDER
PER SMT BEENA PILLAI, JUDICIAL MEMBER:
Present appeal has been filed by assessee against ex parte order dated
22/01/19 passed by Ld. CIT (A)-1, Bangalore for assessment year 2014-15.
2\. At the outset, it has been submitted that assessee has filed present
appeal with a delay of 82 days before this Tribunal.
ITA No.1554(B)/2019  2 2.2 Ld.AR submitted that assessee was having helped
issues because of which he was travelling abroad and could not be present to
take cognizance of various notices issued by authorities below.
2.3 She submitted that the delay in filing present appeal is also because of
health reasons that assessee had to travel and was not available within the
limitation period for the said appeal to be filed.
Ld.Sr.DR referring to affidavit filed by assessee for condonation of delay
submitted that assessee was suffering from aftermath, stomach upset and back
pain except for which there is no need to approach Stanford Speciality
Hospital. She submitted that notice of hearing before Ld.CIT(A) was issued to
assessee even by email for which there was no response.
3\. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records
placed before us. Reasons submitted by assessee in his affidavit as well as
submitted by Ld.AR does not bring out clearly hard pressed situation of
assessee. However, in our opinion, no party could be denied right of being
heard. As Ld.CIT(A) dismissed the appeal by applying CIT vs Multiplan India
Pvt.Ltd. reported in 38 ITD 320, without deciding the issue on merits, the
issue deserves to be set-aside to Ld.CIT (A). 3.1 We therefore, condone delay
of 82 days in filing present appeal, subject to payment of Rs.10,000/- to
Karnataka Chief Ministers relief fund. Ld.CIT(A) shall fix date of hearing,
only upon production of receipt along with affidavit of payment having
actually been made by assessee.
ITA No.1554(B)/2019  3 In the result, appeal filed by assessee stands allowed
for statistical purposes.
