    DATED :    12.10 .2011
    CORAM :
    THE HONOURABLE Mrs.JUSTICE K. MOHAN RAM

    A.S.No.178 of 2007
    1.R. Radhakrishnan
    2.R. Kailashkumar					.... Appellants
    vs
    1.G. Ekambaram
    2.Arun alias Jayapal
    3.E.Kaviarasu					.... Respondents
Appeal filed under Sec.96 of the Central Procedure Code against the judgment
and decree made in O.S.No.482 of 2004 dated 03.08.2006 on the file of the
learned Addtiional District Judge Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu.
    		For appellant 	:   Mr.T.V. Ramanujam
    				     Senior counsel for
agreement.
58\. In the case reported in AIR 1983 (Mad) 169 (H.G. Krishna Reddy & Co vs
M.M. Thimmiah and another) (cited supra) in paragraph 21 it is held as
follows:
`21..... Though no doubt Ex.P.1 has specified the consideration amount and the
property to be sold, a perusal of Ex.P.1 leaves the impression that a regular
agreement of sale on a stamp paper has to be executed within 15 days from the
date of Ex.P.1 and that the said recital is a condition of the bargain between
the parties under Ex.P.1..... Similarly, in the case on hand, Ex.A.1
specified the consideration amount and the property to be sold and imposes a
condition for the vendor to obtain permission from the competent court and on
such permission, the parties are to execute a regular agreement of sale.
59\. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the agreement dated
13.8.1995 is not a concluded contract and the trial court is right in holding
so. In view of the reasons stated above, we do not find it necessary to
interfere with the decree and judgment of the Trial court.
    				     Senior counsel for
    				     M/s K. Sridhar and L. Kishore
    		For  R.2 and R.3	:    Mr.S. Parthasarathy,
    				      Senior Counsel for
    				       Mr.N. Damodaran
    		For respondent	:    Mr.Muthappan
    G.M. AKBAR ALI,J.,
Appeal filed under Sec.96 of the Central Procedure Code against the judgment
and decree made in O.S.No.482 of 2004 dated 03.08.2006 on the file of the
learned Addtiional District Judge Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu
2\. The plaintiffs are the appellants. The suit was filed for Specific
performance of an alleged sale agreement dated 13.8.1995. The brief facts are
as follows:
3\. The 1st respondent is the father and the respondents 2 and 3 are the sons.
They inherited the suit property under a partition deed dated 17.9.1985. There
are three schedules of property and each entitled to 36 cents. The 1st
respondent entered into an agreement of sale with the appellants on 13.8.1995
including the properties of respondents 2 and 3 who were minors.
4\. The rate was agreed at Rs.20,000/-per cent and the 1st respondent received
an advance of Rs.50,000/- on the date of agreement. The agreement was named
and styled as `Token advance document for the sale of land' (Nila virkiraya
Token advance pathiram).
5\. According to the agreement, the 1st respondent must obtain permission from
the competent court for the sale of minors' property and after obtaining
permission and on verification of records, the appellant is to pay a further
sum of Rs.6,00,000/- as advance and execute a sale agreement with usual terms.
6\. In HMGOP No.39 of 1996 the learned Principal and District Judge,
Chengalpattu passed an order permitting the 1st respondent to effect sale of
the minors' property at Rs.3,200/- per cent. This order was passed on
30.4.1996. In the meantime, the appellant had paid a sum of Rs.50,000/- on
2.1.1996, and another sum of Rs.50,000/- on 8.1.1996 to the first respondent.
7\. Since the permission was obtained from the Court, the appellants
approached the 1st respondent with a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and demanded
execution of the sale deed. As the first respondent evaded a notice was issued
on 12.7.1996 by the appellant to receive the said sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and
also to complete the sale by receiving the balance sale consideration within
four months from the date of receipt of above said amount.
8\. The 1st repondent/defendant sent a reply in which he admitted that he
entered into an agreement of sale and also admitted the receipt of an advance
of Rs.50,000/- on the date of agreement and receipt of Rs.50,000/-each on
2.1.1996 and 8.1.1996.
9\. However, it was stated that the sale was not in the interest of minors and
therefore, the 1st respondent was not able to comply the demand of notice. The
appellants filed a suit in OS No.930 of 1996 in the Court of Distrct Munsif
for a permanent injunction restraining the respondents from disposing of the
suit property. The suit was resisted by the respondents. Thereafter, the
appellants filed the present suit for specific performance of the sale
agreement on 13.8.1995.
10\. The 1st respondent filed a written statement interalia stating that the
alleged agreement dated 13.8.1995 is only an agreement to enter into a sale
agreement of the property and it is not a concluded contract. He would admit
the execution of such document to sell the suit properties at the rate of
Rs.20,000/-per cent. He would also admit the subsequent payments dated
2.1.1996 and 8.1.1996. However, he would state that the appellant himself
engaged his own lawyer to file HMGOP No.39 of 1996 and has given a false
information by stating the sale price at Rs.3,200/- per cent. He would also
allege that the value of the property was more than Rs.30,000/-per cent and
the sale of the property is not in the interest of the minors and he is not
bound by the agreement dated 13.8.1995 which is not a concluded contract.
11\. The 1st respondent had also taken a stand that the present suit was not
maintainable under Or.2 Rule 2 CPC as the plaintiff had failed to claim
similar relief in O.S.No.930 of 1996 which is the earlier suit and therefore
the subsequent relief is barred.
12\. The defendants 2 and 3 represented by their guardian, filed a separate
written statement. They would allege that the 1st respondent cannot enter into
an agreement of sale on their behalf since they were minors and the sale
agreement was against the interest of the minors. They would also state that
the 1st respondent had acted against their interest and he is also of immoral
character spending lavishly and had filed a petition before the District Court
with false information and that they were not bound by the agreement dated
30.8.1995.
13\. The appellants filed a reply statement stating that the stand of the
respondents 2 and 3 is only an after-thought and collusion between the father
and sons and the suit for specific performance is not hit under Or.2 Rule 2 of
CPC as the earlier suit was for a different cause of action.
14\. With these pleading, the parties went for a trial before the learned
Additional District Judge cum Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu. The learned
Judge framed as many as 6 issues and 4 additional issues and after hearing the
arguments, recast the following 5 issues:
1\. whethere the suit agreement is a sale agreement?
    2. Whether a specific relief can be granted on the basis of the                  agreement?
    3. whether the agreement is binding on the minor defendants 2 and 3?
    4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the specific performance of  the contract?
      5. To what relief?,
     	15.  The plaintiff  examined 2 witnesses and marked 18 documents. The respondents  also examined 2 witnesses  but did  not mark any document.
16\. On analysing the oral and documentary evidence, the trial court found
that the agreement was not a concluded contract, but only an agreement to
enter into a sale agreement and on that agreement, the plaintiffs are not
entitled for specific performance of contract. Therefore, the trial court
dismissed the suit. However, the trial court neither framed the issue whether
the suit is barred under Or 2 Rule 2 of CPC, nor a finding was given thereof.
The trial court has also not framed an issue whether the appellants were ready
and willing to perform the contract of sale agreement. Aggrieved by the
dismissal of the suit, the plaintiffs are before this court.
17\. The points for consideration arising in the present appeal are;
    1.  whether the agreement dated 13.8.1995                                                      is a concluded contract?
    2. If so,  whether the appellants are entitled for relief of specific performance of contract?
18\. Mr.T.V. Ramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant would submit
that the agreement dated 13.8.1995 is an agreement of sale and a concluded
contract. The learned senior counsel pointed out that the agreement was
entered into between the appellants and the 1st respondent for himself and on
behalf of the respondents 2 and 3, for the sale of properties belonging to
them at a sale price of Rs.20,000/-per cent and the 1st respondent had
received a sum of Rs.50,000/-as advance.
19\. The learned senior counsel pointed out that obtaining permission from the
competent court for the sale of minors' property is only a condition
incidental to the sale agreement and receipt of the 2nd instalment of
Rs.6,00,000/- is only a further condition before completing the sale.
20\. The learned Senior counsel further pointed out that in continuance to the
said agreement, the 1st respondent had filed an application before the
District Court, Chengalpattu and had obtained a permission to sell the minors'
property and he has also received a sum of Rs.50,000/- on two occasions
towards sale consideration. He would further state that when the 1st
respondent has failed to receive the 2nd instalment of Rs.5,00,000/- and come
forward to complete the sale, the appellants have issued the notice which was
duly received by the 1st respondent and the reply is also to the effect
admitting that he had entered into an agreement of sale. The only defence
taken by the 1st respondent is that the value of the land is more than
Rs.30,000/- per cent and the agreement is at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per cent
and therefore, the wife of the respondent is not agreeable to sell the
property.
21\. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that the respondents never
took a plea that it is not a concluded contract and for the first time in the
suit such a plea was taken. The learned Senior would contend that the terms of
the agreement dated 13.8.1995 would show that it is a sale agreement with
definite terms and it is enforceabe under law. He further submitted that time
for performence, though not mentioned in Ex.A1, is not a ground to hold that
it is not a concluded contract.
22\. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that the appellants were all
along ready and willing and also tendered a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-apart from the
advance as a second instalment and therefore, they were entitled for a decree
of specific performance of the contrct
23\. The learned senior counsel relied on the following case laws:
i) AIR 1964 (SC) 1810 (Gurbax Singh vs Bhooralal)
ii) 2002 (3) MLJ 177 (R. Vimalchand and another vs Ramalingm and others)
iii)1997 (1) SCC 99 (Bengal Waterproof Limited vs Bombay Waterproof
Manufacturing Company and another)
(iv) 2003 (9) SCC 606 (Bansari and others vs Ram Phal)
(v) AIR 1968 SC 1028 (Kollipara Sriramulu (dead) by his legal representative
vs T. Aswatha Narayana (dead) by his legal representatives and others)

(vii) 2004 (6) SCC 649 (P.D. Souza vs shondrilo Naidu)

(ix)AIR 1960 Calcutta 752 (Gostho Behari Sirkar vs Surs Estates Ltd)
(x) 2010 (3) SCC 1 (Trimex International Fze Limited, Dubai vs Vedanta
Aluminium Limited, India)
24\. On the other hand, Mr.S. Parthasarathy, learned senior counsel who
appeared for the respondents 2 and 3 would submit that the agreement dated
13.8.1995 is not a concluded contract and the 1st respondent cannot enter into
an agreement detrimental to interest of the minors.
25\. The learned senior counsel pointed out that the case of the respondents 2
and 3 is that the 1st respondent had acted against the interest of the minors
and an agreement which is against the interest of the minors is opposed to
law. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that the suit is also barred
under Or 2 Rule 2 CPC.
26\. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that it is an admitted case
of the appellant that the permission petition was filed and prosecuted by the
appellant giving false information and therefore, the respondents 2 and 3 are
not bound by the agreement.
27\. The learned senior counsel relied on the following case laws:
i) AIR 1963 SC 1516 (Panna Lal vs State of Bombay)
ii) 1987 (Supp) SCC 528 (Mahant Dhangir and another vs Madan Mohan and others)
(iii) AIR 1963 SC 884 (Nedunuri Kameswaramma vs Sampath Subba Rao)
(iv) 2010 (5) CTC 423 (Bafna Developers vs D.K. Natarajan)

(vii) 2010 (8) MLJ 52 (Sornam and others vs A. Venugopal and others)
(viii)2009 (1) SCC 475 (Speech and Software Technologies (India) Pvt Ltd vs
Neos Interactive Limited)
28\. Mr.Muthappan, learned counsel for the 1st respondent would also submit
that the agreement dated 13.8.1995 is not a sale agreement and not binding on
the respondents.
29\. We have carefully considered the rival contentions putforth on either
side and perused the materials available on record.
30\. The admitted facts of the case are as follows:
The respondents 1 to 3 were allotted the suit properties under a registered
parition deed dated 17.9.1985, marked as Ex.A.13. Each is entitled to 36
cents. The 1st respondent had entered into an agreement on 13.8.1995 for the
sale of the property which was allotted not only to him but also to the
respondents 2 and 3. The sale consideration was at Rs.20,000/-per cent and he
had received a sum of Rs.50,000/- on 13.8.1995 as advance. He had also
received a sum of Rs.50,000/- each on two occasions on 2.1.96 and 8.1.96.
31\. An application to accord permission for the sale of the minors' property
in HMGOP 39 of 1996 was filed before the District Court Chengalpattu and
permission was also granted.
32\. The disputed facts are as follows;
The agreement is only an agreement to enter into a sale agreement. Therefore,
it is not a concluded contract. The appellents themselves had filed the
permission petition before the District Court for the sale of the minors'
property by giving a false information that the properties are to be sold at
Rs.3,200/-per cent when the actual value of the property was more than
Rs.30,000/-per cent.
33\. The sale agreement is not in the interst of the minors and hence not
binding. The suit is also barred under Or.2 Rule 2 CPC. as the appellants have
filed earlier a suit for permanent injunction restraining the respondents not
to alienate the property based on the alleged sale agreement.
34\. As stated earlier, the trial court has not framed an issue whether the
suit is barred under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC and has not given any finding.
However, such plea is a legal plea and is also raised in the appeal. we have
to consider whether the suit is barred under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
35\. Or 2 Rule 2 CPC reads as follows:
2\. Suit to include the whole claim.
(1) ......
(2) Relinquishment of part of claimWhere a plaintiff omits to sue in respect
of, or intentionally relinquishes, any portion of his claim he shall not
afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished.
36\. The learned Senior counsel relied on a decision reported in AIR 1964 (SC)
1810 (Gurbax Singh vs Bhooralal), wherein the Apex Court has held as follows:
`7. In order that a plea of a bar under O.2 r.2(3), Civil Procedure Code
should succeed the defendant who raises the plea must make out (1) that the
second suit was in respect of the same cause of action as that on which the
previous suit was based, (2) that in respect of that cause of action the
plaintiff was entitled to more than one relief, (3) that being thus entitled
to moe than one relief the plaintiff, without leave obtained from the Court,
omitted to sue for the relief for which the second suit had been filed. From
this analysis it would be seen that the defendant would have to establish
primarily and to start with, the precise cause of action upon which the
previous suit was filed, for unless there is identity between the cause of
action on which the earlier suit was filed and that on which the claim in the
later suit is based there would be no scope for the application of the bar. No
doubt, a relief which is sought in a plaint could ordinarily be treaceable to
a particular cause of action but this might, by no means, be the universale
rule. As the plea is a technical bar it has to be established satisfactorily
and cannot be presumed merely on basis of inferential reasoning. It is for
this reason that we consider that a plea of a bar under o.2.r.2 Civil
Procedure Code can be established only if the defendant files in evidence the
pleadings in the previous suit and thereby proves to the Court the identity of
the cause of action in the two suits. It is common ground that the pleadings
in C.S.28 of 1950 were not filed by the appellant in the present suit as
evidence in support of his lea under O.2 r.2, Civil Procedure Code. The
learned trial judge, however, without these pleadings being on the record
inferred what the cause of action should have been from the reference to the
previus suit contained in the plaint as a matter of deduction. At the stage of
appeal the learned District Judge noticed this lacuna in the appellant's case
and pointed out, in our opinion rightly, that without the plaint in the
previus suit being on the record, a plea of a bar under O.2 r.2, Civil
Procedure Code was not maintainable. Learned Counsel for the appellant,
however, drew our attention to a passage in the judgment of the learned Judge
in the High Court which read:
The plaint, written statement or the judgment of the erlier court has not
been filed by any of the parties to the suit. The only document filed was the
judgment in appeal in the earlier suit. The two courts have, however, freely
cited from the record of the earlier suit. The counsel for the parties have
likewise done so. That file is also before this Court.
37\. The learned senior counsel for the appellant also relied on a decision
reported in AIR 2002 (3) MLJ 177 (R. Vimalchand and another vs Ramalingam an
others), wherein, a Divison Bench of this Court has held as follows:
`29. In order to find out the maintainability of the suit, on the principle of
o.2, Rule 2, C.P.C, one has to consider the necessary fact which give rise the
cause of action of the earlier suit and not the mere right to file the suit.
It is necessary to keep in mind that the term `cause of action' for the
purpose of O.2, Rule 2, C.P.C means the cause of action which gives occasion
for and forms the foundation of the suit. There is a distinction between
`cause of action' and `right of action'.
30\. O.2 C.P.C can be made applicable only if the earlier suit was disposed of
and thereafter a fresh suit is being filed with the same cause of action for
fresh relief. When the present suit has been filed during the pendency of the
earlier suit, in our view, the provision of O.2 Rule 2 CPC is not attracted.
It is also the fact that the present relief of specific performance was not
within the jurisdiction of the Court in which earlier suit was pending
38\. The learned Senior Counsel further relied on a decison reported in 1997
(1) SCC 99 (Bengal Waterproof Limited vs Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing
Company and another),wherein the Apex Court has held as follows:
`7..... So far as sub-rule (3) of Rule 2 of Order 2 CPC is concerned, bar of
which appealed to both the courts below, before the second suit of the
plaintiff can be held to be barred by the same it must be shown that the
second suit is based on the same cause of action on which the earlier suit was
based and if the cause of action is the same in both the suits and if in the
earlier suit plaintiff had not sued for any of the reliefs available to it on
the basis of that cause of action, the reliefs which it had failed to press in
service in that suit cannot be subsequently prayed for except with the leave
of the court.
39\. The learned counsel for the respondents relied on a decision reported in
2010 (8) MLJ 52 (Sornam and others vs A. Venugopal and others), wherein the
learned single Judge of this Court, in a matter, where the agreement holder
initially filed a suit for injunction and later filed a suit for specific
performance held that, when the cause of action urged in the later suit was
very much available at the time of filing of the earlier suit, the later suit
will be barred under Or.2 Rule 2 CPC.
40\. The case reported in AIR 2002 (3) MLJ 177 (R. Vimalchand and another vs
Ramalingam an others), cited supra is a Division Bench ruling wherein also an
earlier suit was filed for an injunction restraining the defendants not to
alienate the property and the later suit was filed for specific performance of
the contract. The division bench held that the cause of action has to be seen
only from the averments in the pleadings and where the new suit is founded
upon a cause of action distinct from that which was the foundation for the
former suit, Or.2 Rule 2 CPC has no application.
41\. In AIR 1964 (SC) 1810 (Gurbax Singh vs Bhooralal), cited supra, the Apex
Court had also held that without the pleading being on the record, the court
cannot infer the cause of action.
42\. The decision reported in 1997 (1) SCC 99 (Bengal Waterproof Limited vs
Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Company and another) is also on the same line.
43\. In the present case, though the respondents had pleaded that the present
suit is barred under Or.2 R.2 CPC, they have not placed the pleadings of the
former suit. They have also not raised an issue before the trial court and the
trial court has also not gone into this issue. It is well settled that Or.2
C.P.C can be made applicable only if the earlier suit was disposed of and
thereafter a fresh suit is being filed with the same cause of action for fresh
relief. When the present suit has been filed during the pendency of the
earlier suit, the provision of O.2 Rule 2 CPC is not attracted. It is also the
fact that the present relief of specific performance was not within the
jurisdiction of the Court in which earlier suit was pending. More over the
respondents have also not produced the plaint filed in the earlier suit for
permenent injunction. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the
present suit is not barred under Or.2 Rule 2 CPC.
44\. Now the only question is whether the suit agreement is a concluded
contract? In a Privi council case reported in AIR 1923 PC 47 (Harichand vs
Govind) (cited supra) it is held that `whether an agreement is a completed
bargain or merely a provisional arrangement depends on the intention of the
parties as deducible from the langauage used by the parties on the occasion
when the negotiation take a concrete shape. As observed by the Lord
Chancellor, in Ridgway vs Walton the fact of a subsequent agreement being
prepared may be evidence that the previous negotiations did not amount to an
agreement but the mere fact that persons wish to have a formal agreement drawn
up does not establish the proposition that they cannot be bound by the
previous agreement.
The case before the Privy Council was that there were two agreements between
the parties and in one agreement, there is a condition that the agreement
holders' solicitors should approve the title and prepare a bargain paper.
However, the Privy Council found that both agreements show clearly that the
parties had come to a definite and complete agreement and the intention to
draw up a formal document later does not negative the binding nature of the
previous agreement.
45\. In AIR 1968 SC 1028 (Kollipara Sriramulu (dead) by his legal
representative vs T. Aswatha Narayana (dead) by his legal representatives and
others), as relied on by the learned senior counsel for the appellant, relates
to a case where there was an oral agreement between the parties with an
intention to execute a formal document. In paragraph 3 of the judgment the
court held `it is well established that a mere reference to a future formal
contract will not prevent a binding bargain between the parties. The fact that
the parties refer to the preparation of an agreement by which the terms agreed
upon are to be put in a more formal shape does not prevent the existence of a
binding contract.
46\. In 2007 (5) SCC 295 (Maharshi Dayanand University and another vs Anand
Co-op L/C Society Ltd and another) the Apex Court had dealt with a case where
the parties during negotiations contemplate the execution of formal agreement
incorporating the terms of bargain, an offer was made and accpeted and the
essential terms of contract agreed upon and the suprme court held that then
the contract came into existence.
47\. In AIR 1960 Calcutta 752 (Gostho Behari Sirkar vs Surs Estates Ltd), the
High Court of Calcutta held `that documents may upon a true construction,
amount to a binding contract for sale and purchase of immovable property,
enforceable by specific performance although they provide for preparation of a
contract by a lawyer and that provision with other terms of the agreement is
described in the translation of the document as a condition. The learned Judge
also incorporated the report of the judicial committee which reads as follows:
`Whether an agreement is a completed bargain or merely a provisional
arrangement depends on the intention of the parties as deducible from the
language used by the parties on the occasion when the negotiations take a
concrete shape. As observed by the Lord Chancellor (Lord Cranworth) in Ridgway
vs Wharton (1857) 6 HLC 238 at pp.263, 264, the fact of a subsequent agreement
being prepared may be evidence that the previous negotiations did not amount
to an agreement, but the mere fact that persons wish to have a formal
agreement drawn up does not establish the preposition that they cannot be
bound by a previous agreementand concluded that the essential question is to
find out whether the formal document is of such a nature that it was the very
conditic of that contract or whether it was merely commemorative of the
evidence on the point.'
48\. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the respondents relied
on a decision reported in 2009 (1) SCC 475 (Speech and Software Technologies
(India) Pvt Ltd vs Neos Interactive Limited), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held as follows:
`22. The said letter of intent on a bare reading is nothing but an agreement
to enter into another agreement because it is provided in the said letter that
`both parties agreed to have set a deadline to sign this agreement by
15.9.2006`. It is well-settled legal position that an agreement to enter into
an agreement is not enforceale nor does it confer any right upon the parties.
The agreement in terms of the said letter of intent was to be signed on or
before 15.9.2006
49\. In AIR 1983 (Mad) 169 (H.G. Krishna Reddy & Co vs M.M. Thimmiah and
another), wherein it is held that if a document which is entered into between
two parties and which is relied on as constituting a contract contemplates
execution of a further regular agreement between the parties, it is a matter
for construction whether the execution of the further contract is a condition
of the terms of the bargain or whether it is mere expression of the desire of
the parties as to the manner in which the original agreement should be
performed. In the former case, there cannot be any enforceable contract unless
the condition is fulfilled.
50\. Therefore, the proposition of law as laid down by the above decision are
as follows:
i) the intention of the parties should be gathered from the language of the
document;
ii) Whether an agreement is a completed bargain or merely a provisional
arrangement depends on the intention of the parties;
iii) A reference to a future formal agreement will not prevent a binding
bargain between the parties;
iv) Binding nature depends upon the true construction in the definite terms in
the enforceability of the specific performance;
v) a mere agreement to enter into an agreement is not enforceable but an
agreement with definite terms of binding nature is enforceable;and
vi) if a document contemplates execution of a further regular agreement
between the parties, it is a matter for construction whether the execution of
the further contract is a condition of the terms of the bargain or whether it
is mere expression of the desire of the parties as to the manner in which the
original agreement should be performed. In the former case, there cannot be
any enforceable contract unless the condition is fulfilled.
51\. On this legal background let us see the construction of the disputed
document. Ex.A.1 is the agreement dated 13.8.1995. The nomenclature of the
agreement is `Token advance agreement for a sale of the land. It was entered
between the appellant and for the 1st respondent for himself and on behalf of
his minor sons. The sale price was fixed at Rs.20,000/-per cent and a sum of
Rs.50,000/- was given as advance.
52\. There are three conditions contemplated in the agreement. (1) the 1st
respondent is to produce all the original records including the patta, chitta,
adangal and encumbrance certificate to the appellants for verification. (2)
the first respondent is to obtain a permission from the competent court for
the sale of minors' property and (3) on verification of the all the above
records, the appellants would tender the 2nd instalment of Rs.6,00,000/- as
advance and on such advance being tendered , a regular sale agreement has to
be executed.
53\. No doubt, the 1st respondent in his written statement and also in his
evidence and in the reply notice would admit that it is a sale agreement. The
respondents 2 and 3 would oppose the agreement on two grounds; the sale is not
in the interest of the minors, time is not prescribed and the sale price was
more than Rs.30,000/-per cent whereas the appellants have obtained permission
from the court by giving false information about the sale price at Rs.3200/-
per cent.
54\. As the competent court had granted permission, under Ex.A.5, dated
12.7.1996, the appellants would call upon the 1st respondent to receive the
2nd instalment of advance of Rs.5,00,000/- within 15 days from the date of
receipt of notice and complete the sale by receiving the remaining
consideration within four months from the date of receipt of the said amount.
55\. To constitute a definite and concluded contract of a sale agreement,
there shall be an offer and acceptance, agreement on a definite sale price and
an agreed period of time for the execution of the agreement. These are the
definite terms in the enfoceability of the specific performence. The other
terms and conditions are incidental. If a document contemplates, that on a
fullfilment of a condition, execution of a further regular agreement so as to
incorporate any one of the above said definite terms, it is not a concluded
contract. It is only an agreement to enter into an agreement as the intention
of the parties is fullfilment of a condition.
56\. As stated earlier, out of three conditions in the disputed agreement, the
first two conditions refer to the terms which the vendor is to perform. On
fullfilment of the above conditions, the 3rd condition contemplates execution
further regular agreement on receipt of an advance of Rs.6,00,000/- and the
balance sale consideration is to be paid within four months thereon to
complete the sale. The said intention is expressed under Ex.A.5 notice by
stating that on complying the two conditions the vendor to recive additional
advance and, the balance sale consideration is to be paid within four months
thereon to complete the sale.
57\. The prescribed time for performence of the contract which is one of the
definite terms of the contract is definitely missing in Ex.A.1 agreement and
the condition No.3 is inconclusive and contemplates a further completed
agreement.
58\. In the case reported in AIR 1983 (Mad) 169 (H.G. Krishna Reddy & Co vs
M.M. Thimmiah and another) (cited supra) in paragraph 21 it is held as
follows:
`21..... Though no doubt Ex.P.1 has specified the consideration amount and the
property to be sold, a perusal of Ex.P.1 leaves the impression that a regular
agreement of sale on a stamp paper has to be executed within 15 days from the
date of Ex.P.1 and that the said recital is a condition of the bargain between
the parties under Ex.P.1..... Similarly, in the case on hand, Ex.A.1
specified the consideration amount and the property to be sold and imposes a
condition for the vendor to obtain permission from the competent court and on
such permission, the parties are to execute a regular agreement of sale.
59\. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the agreement dated
13.8.1995 is not a concluded contract and the trial court is right in holding
so. In view of the reasons stated above, we do not find it necessary to
interfere with the decree and judgment of the Trial court.
60\. In the result the appeal is dismissed and the judgment and decree made in
O.S.No.482 of 2004 dated 03.08.2006 on the file of the learned Addtiional
District Judge Fast Track Court No.I, Chengalpattu is confirmed. No costs.
