Bench: J Koshy, J James
JUDGMENT J.B. Koshy, J.
1\. Justice Mr. Abdul Gafoor referred this appeal to the Division Bench to
consider the question regarding the nature of compliance of Section 13(2) of
the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (for short 'the Act'),
disagreeing with the views expressed by another learned Single Judge of this
Court in Crl.A.No. 288/1985. The sample of milk taken from the first
respondent was found to be not according to the prescribed standards. Ext.C-1
analysis report from the Central Food Laboratory, Pune, shows that the sample
contained 3.1% of milk fat and 5.2% of milk solids other than fat. As per
Entry A.11.01.11, of Appendix B of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules,
1955, (for short the Rules') cow milk should contain a minimum of 3.5% of milk
fat and 8.5% of milk solids other than fat. Therefore, admittedly, the milk
sold by the accused was not upto the standards prescribed.
2\. The learned Magistrate convicted the accused and sentenced him to undergo
simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 500, in default,
right to the accused and substantial compliance of the same is mandatory.
Defect, if any, in the compliance of that section shall not be of the nature,
which may cause prejudice to the accused. We note that in Crl.A.No. 288 of
1985 the learned Single Judge did not consider the question whether any
prejudice was caused to the accused or not, due to the defective compliance of
Section 13(2) of the Act in this case. The Act itself is enacted to check the
antisocial evil of adulterating food articles, and hence, punishment for
offences under the Act cannot be interfered with lightly.
7\. Learned counsel for the accused submitted that the acquittal of the
accused could be maintained on another ground, not mentioned by the Sessions
Judge, and that the milk was not mixed properly before sampling. However, such
a contention also is not possible, because P. W. 1 has stated the milk was
mixed properly. He stated as follows:
P.W.1 was not cross-examined on this aspect at all.
In the above circumstances, the Judgment of the Sessions Judge, Palakkad in
Crl.A.No. 20 of 1995, acquitting the accused, is set aside and the conviction
simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 500, in default,
to undergo simple imprisonment for one month, under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read
with Section 7(i) of the Act and Rule 44(b) of the Rules. The learned Sessions
Judge, in appeal, acquitted the accused on three grounds. The learned Single
Judge has found that the acquittal of the accused on two grounds was incorrect
and not justified. Those findings have become final and are not challenged
before us. To under stand the controversy, we quote Section 13(1)&(2)as
follows;
"13. Report of public analyst.--
(1) The public analyst shall deliver, in such form as may be prescribed, a
report to the Local (Health) Authority of the result of the analysis of any
article of food submitted to him . for analysis.
(2) On receipt of the report of the result of the analysis under Sub-section
(1) to the effect that the article of food is adulterated, the Local (Health)
Authority shall, after the institution of prosecution against the persons from
whom the sample of the article of food was taken and the person, if any, whose
name, address and other particulars have been disclosed under Section 14A,
forward, in such manner as may be prescribed, a copy of the report of the
result of the analysis to such person or persons, as the case may be,
informing such persons that if it is so desired, either or both of them may
make an application to the Court within a period of ten days from the date of
receipt of the copy of the report to get the sample of the article of food
kept by the Local (Health) Authority analysed by the Central Food Laboratory."
3\. We quote below the order of reference:

4\. The third reason for reversal of conviction was that there was violation
of the mandatory provisions under Section 13(2) of the Act in so far as P.W.3,
the Commissioner of the Municipality concerned, was not the Local Health
Authority. Only the Health Officer in the Municipality was the Local Health
Authority. Only in his absence the Commissioner will be the Local Health
Authority. P.W.3 the Commissioner cannot, therefore, cannot be the Health
Authority in this case. Therefore on that ground the conviction cannot be
sustained.
5\. The Local Health Authority in terms of Section 2(viii a) is the;
Local (Health) Authority, in relation to the local area, means the officer
appointed by the Central Government or the State Government, by notification
in the Official Gazette, to be in charge of Health Administration in such area
with such designation as may be specified therein.
Thus the Local Health Authority is an authority in charge of Health
Administration of a particular area. Its functions in terms of Section 11 (1
)(c)(ii) is to receive the remaining two parts of the samples collected by the
Food Inspector 'for the purposes of Sub-section (2) of this section and Sub-
sections (2A)and (2E) of Section 13'.
6\. In terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 11 the function enjoined on Local
Health Authority is on a requisition made to it by the public analyst or the
Food Inspector to despatch one of the said two parts of the sample to the
public analyst in case the one sent to him had been lost.
7\. In terms of Sub-section (2A) of Section 13 the function enjoined on the
Local Health Authority is when an application is made by the accused concerned
to the Court to forward the parts of samples kept by him, when the Court
require him to send the same.
8\. In terms of Sub-section (2B) of Section 13 the function enjoined on the
Local Health Authority is to intimate the Court with regard to the mark and
seal or fastening on the sample received by him.
9\. His function has, therefore, nothing but do with the prosecution of the
case in the Court at the instance of Food Inspector upon his complaint. Even
in a case where a superior authority of the Local Health Authority had acted
as a Local Health Authority to keep the samples, which has been sealed by the
Food Inspector, to be sent to the Court as and when requisition is obtained
from the Court, it cannot be said that there will be any prejudice to the
accused. So on that ground also I feel that the acquittal cannot be sustained.
10\. It was at that time counsellor the respondent/accused had pointed out to
me a decision of this Court in Crl.A.No. 288/1983, which reads as follows:
P.W. 1, the Food Inspector, has stated in the examination in chief that he
entrusted two parts of the sample together with the other documents to the
Municipal Commissioner of Thodupuzha Municipality who was the Local Health
Authority. This shows that there was a Commissioner for Thodupuzha
Municipality during the relevant time. P.W.2 has no case that he was ever
appointed as a Commissioner of that Municipality. In the light of the
aforesaid evidence, I find considerable force in the contention of the learned
counsel for the first respondent that the steps taken by P. W. 1 under Section
11(1)(c)(ii) of the Act are not in accordance with law. It follows that all
the further steps taken by P.W.2 pursuant to such entrustment were also not in
his capacity as a validly appointed Local Health Authority.'
11\. When there is no prejudice at all for the accused, merely because a
superior officer to the Local Health Authority was keeping the sample duly
sealed, it cannot be stated that the conviction is vitiated or the entire
proceedings taken by the Food Inspector are vitiated. Therefore. I am of the
view that the aforesaid decision requires reconsideration."
4\. The same issue was considered by this Court earlier also in Kunhamu v.
Food Inspector, 1989 (1) KLT 707, wherein, following the Full Bench decision
of this Court in Food Inspector v. Prabhakaran, 1982 KLT 809, Division Bench
decision in and Food Inspector v. Velayudhan, 1987 (1) KLT 722 (D.B.), and the
Apex Court decision in Dalchand v. Municipal Corporation, Bhopal, AIR 1983 SC
303, the Court observed as follows:
"11. Regarding intimation to be sent under Section 13(2) of the Act, this
Court has indicated that substantial compliance is sufficient and the
prosecution can fail only if prejudice is shown to have been caused to the
accused. See Prabhakaran's case, 1982 KLT 809, Food Inspector v.
Naringarappully Co-op. Milk Supply Society Ltd., 1986 KLT 174 (D.B.), Food
Inspector v. Varghese, 1986 KLT 852 and Food Inspector v. Velayudhan,
1987(1)KLT722(D.B.).
12\. The Supreme Court in Dalchand v. Municipal Corporation, Bhopal (AIR 1983
SC 303) held that the period of ten days mentioned in old Rule 9(i) of the
Rules was only directory. The Rule required Food Inspector to send by
registered post copy of the Public Analyst's Report to the person concerned
within ten days of the receipt of the report. The Court held that the period
often days is not a period of limitation and" was prescribed merely with a
view to expedition and with the object of giving him sufficient time to make
arrangements to challenge the report of the public analyst by making request
to send the other sample to the Central Food Laboratory. The Court also
observed that where the effect of non-compliance with the Rule was such as to
wholly deprive the right of the person to challenge the Public Analyst's
Report by obtaining the report of the Director of Central Food Laboratory,
there might be just cause for complaint, as prejudice would then be writ
large. Where no prejudice was caused there could be no cause for complaint.
(Underlining supplied by us for emphasis)
5\. In Food Inspector v. Velayudhan, 1987 (1) KLT 722 (D.B.), the same view
was taken by a Division Bench of this Court, wherein Balakrishnan, J. (as he
then was), observed for the Bench as follows:
"7. Under Section 13(2) of the Act it is not contemplated that the name of the
case should be mentioned therein. Section 13(2) of the Act only mandates to
send a copy of the report of the result of the analysis to such person or
persons as the case may be and also to inform them that they may make
application within 10 days from the date of receipt of copy of the report to
get the sample of the article of food kept by the Local Health Authority
analysed by the Central Food Laboratory. As soon as the accused gets the
intimation he can very well go to the concerned Court and collect the details
regarding the case from the court. Even if there was only defective compliance
of Section 13(2) of the Act, it cannot be said to vitiate the whole
prosecution proceedings unless it is proved that prejudice has been to the
accused. The accused can raise the plea of prejudice only where there is a
total non-compliance of the Section 13(2) intimation. If there was total
absence of the intimation under Section 13(2) of the Act it can be presumed
that prejudice had been caused to the accused. In Dalchand v. Municipal
Corporation, Bhopal, AIR 1983 SC 303 this has been explained by the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court held:
Where the effect of non-compliance with the rule was such as to wholly deprive
the right of the person to challenge the Public Analyst's Report by obtaining
the report of the Director of the Central Food Laboratory, there might be just
cause for complaint, as prejudice would then be writ large."
6\. According to the appellant, there was a Health Officer in the Municipality
during the relevant time and hence the Commissioner was not the Health
Officer. Therefore, it is contended that there is violation of Section 13(2)
of the Act. However, he has no case that any prejudice is caused to him
because instead of the Health Officer, the Commissioner himself actually acted
under Section 13(2) of the Act. In this case, we also note that P.W.3
categorically stated in chief examination that he was the authorised Local
Health Authority during the relevant period. He was not cross-examined on that
aspect. Apart from the above, when he got the report under Section 13(1) of
the Act, he forwarded a copy of the report to the accused in the manner
prescribed and in time the accused for a second analysis of the sample by the
Central Food Laboratory. Even in the second analysis, it was found that the
milk was not upto the standards. Therefore, absolutely no prejudice is caused
to the accused in this case in the Commissioner receiving the report under
Section 13 of the Act. Therefore, we agree with the learned Single Judge,
Justice Gafoor, that the conviction and sentence cannot be interfered with in
a case, merely because compliance of Section 13(2) is defective as no
prejudice is caused to the accused and there is substantial compliance with
the provision of the section. At the same time, Section 13(2) gives a valuable
right to the accused and substantial compliance of the same is mandatory.
Defect, if any, in the compliance of that section shall not be of the nature,
which may cause prejudice to the accused. We note that in Crl.A.No. 288 of
1985 the learned Single Judge did not consider the question whether any
prejudice was caused to the accused or not, due to the defective compliance of
Section 13(2) of the Act in this case. The Act itself is enacted to check the
antisocial evil of adulterating food articles, and hence, punishment for
offences under the Act cannot be interfered with lightly.
7\. Learned counsel for the accused submitted that the acquittal of the
accused could be maintained on another ground, not mentioned by the Sessions
Judge, and that the milk was not mixed properly before sampling. However, such
a contention also is not possible, because P. W. 1 has stated the milk was
mixed properly. He stated as follows:
P.W.1 was not cross-examined on this aspect at all.
In the above circumstances, the Judgment of the Sessions Judge, Palakkad in
Crl.A.No. 20 of 1995, acquitting the accused, is set aside and the conviction
of the first respondent/accused and the sentence imposed on him by the
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chittur in S.T.No. 3877 of 1988 is
restored. This Criminal Appeal is allowed and the reference is answered
accordingly.

simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 500, in default,
to undergo simple imprisonment for one month, under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read
with Section 7(i) of the Act and Rule 44(b) of the Rules. The learned Sessions
