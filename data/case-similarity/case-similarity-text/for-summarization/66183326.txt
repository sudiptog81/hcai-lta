          CORAM:
Delhi. They are dealing with the supply of excisable liquor and they do not
also have any licence for supply of their product in Delhi. The defendants are
also not having their office including the registered office within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor do they have a manufacturing unit in Delhi.
They have also not applied for the registration of their trade mark within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor have they applied for obtaining any excise
licence for supply/sale of their products within jurisdiction of this Court.
No part of cause of action has thus arisen within the jurisdiction of this
Court. The Court, therefore, has no territorial jurisdiction. The plaint is
returned to the plaintiffs for filing in the Court of appropriate
jurisdiction. In view of the above, the interim order dated 23.03.2015 stands
vacated.
The Registrar is directed to do the needful.
The petition along with pending applications stands disposed of in these
terms.
                                                                DEEPA SHARMA
          CORAM:
          HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA
                                     JUDGMENT
1\. The present suit has been filed by the plaintiffs for permanent injunction
restraining the defendants from the infringement of the design and from
passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs and for damages. On the
basis of pleadings of the parties, the issues were framed on 19.07.2016. Issue
no. 2 relates to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
Issue no. 2 is reproduced as under:-
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 1 "2. Whether this Court is not vested with the
territorial jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit instituted
against the defendants? (OPD)
2\. Subsequently, this issue was treated as a preliminary issue and the
arguments of the parties were heard on this issue.
3\. In brief the contentions of the plaintiffs are that the cause of action
had arisen in their favour when they came across to an article on the internet
wherein the defendants have clearly reflected their intention to enter the
Delhi market with its "GRENADE XXX RESERVE BOTTLE" rum product and also arisen
on search of the website of the defendants' and their brochure wherein the
defendants product is clearly visible. The plaintiffs alleged that the said
product is fraudulent imitation of the plaintiff's product. As regards the
jurisdiction of this Court, the plaintiffs have contended in their plaint that
defendants are offering to supply and sell the infringing goods within the
jurisdiction of this Court. The website of the defendants as well as
information in the newspaper reveals that the defendants are about to launch
their product in Delhi and so the plaintiffs have a reasonable apprehension
that the defendants are likely to sell their product within the jurisdiction
of this Court.
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 2
4\. It is averred that the plaintiff no. 1 is the registered company having
its registered office at Rajasthan and that the plaintiff no. 1 is the
licensee of plaintiff no. 2 which is settled in British West Indies. It is a
bottling company running its industry in Rajasthan and one of the most reputed
products of the plaintiffs is "GRENADE DARK RUM BOTTLE" which is marketed
under the trade mark "GRENADE DARK RUM" and has its novelty in every feature
as detailed in the plaint. It is further submitted that the plaintiffs and the
licensee have been selling the said product in the State of Rajasthan where it
is very popular and that the plaintiffs as part of their expansion plan, will
soon launch its product in all major cities including Delhi. It is contended
that the defendant no. 1 is having its registered office in Mumbai. The
defendant no. 2 appears to be a partnership firm also having its office in
Mumbai. They run their websites. The defendant no. 3 is also having its
corporate office in Mumbai. While the defendant nos. 1 and 2 appear to be
engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling alcoholic beverages, the
defendant no. 3 is engaged in printing and packaging products. The plaintiffs
have the belief that they are engaged in manufacturing and selling alcoholic
beverages under the identical and deceptively same trade mark as those of the
plaintiffs and thereby the CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 3 defendants are
infringing its trademark. No samples, however, are found in the market for
verification but their websites clearly show their products. They are
producing, manufacturing their product in Kolhapur and the websites show that
it will soon be available in all parts of India. There was also a publication
in the newspaper dated 16.12.2014 wherein the spokesperson of defendants
disclosed the plans of defendants to launch the product on PAN India basis. It
is submitted that the defendants are thus copying their design and thereby
infringing their trademark and it is going to create confusion in the mind of
purchasing public. In para 33 of the plaint, the plaintiffs have disclosed
that this Court has the jurisdiction.
5\. Defendants, however, in their written statement, had taken the preliminary
objection as regards the jurisdiction of the Court stating that no part of
cause of action has arisen in Delhi. It is contended that plaintiffs are
indulging in the forum shopping. It is submitted that admittedly the business
operations of the plaintiffs are confined to Rajasthan and those of the
defendants in the State of Maharashtra and also in Goa. It is submitted that
the plaintiffs have suppressed the fact that the defendant no. 2 is the owner
of the registered design bearing registration certificate No. 260116 dated
21.07.2014. The defendant no. 2 is, therefore, prima facie proprietor of the
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 4 said design and is therefore entitled to use the
same. Also, the plaintiffs do not enjoy any goodwill in Delhi since its
offices are confined to Rajasthan.
6\. It is submitted that the defendants are neither having its registered
office in Delhi nor they are doing their business in Delhi or indulging into
commercial activities in Delhi. It is submitted that the defendants are just
talking about the plans to explore other parts of the country. The plaintiffs
also do not have any persons/business in Delhi and hence, this Court has no
jurisdiction.
7\. The case of the plaintiffs is premised upon their contention that
defendants are likely to sell its products in Delhi. It is argued by learned
counsel of the plaintiffs that it gives rise to a cause of action in their
favour and the plaintiffs have filed this suit to take a quia timet action in
order to prevent the injury which they are likely to suffer. Learned counsel
for the plaintiffs has relied on the findings in the case of Pfizer Products,
Inc. vs. Rajesh Chopra & Others, 2006 (1) R.A.J. 536 (Del) more particularly
on para 12 of the judgment and argued that mere threat to sell the product
which would infringe its trade mark in Delhi is sufficient to confer
jurisdiction to this Court.
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 5 "12. The other aspect of the matter is that a
threat of selling the offending goods in Delhi would in itself confer
jurisdiction in the courts in Delhi to entertain a suit claiming an injunction
in respect thereof. Whether the threat perception is justified or not is
another matter which has to be considered and decided upon in the application
filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 or on merits when the suit
is taken up for disposal. Insofar as Order 7 Rule 10 is concerned, assuming
that whatever is stated in the plaint is correct, one would have to also
assume that the threat or the intention of the defendants to sell and offer
for sale the offending goods in Delhi is also correct. Therefore, if the
threat exists then this court would certainly have jurisdiction to entertain
the present suit.
In these circumstances, this application is dismissed. No order as to costs."
8\. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs has also placed reliance on the
findings in para 23 onwards in the case of Bristol Myers Squibb Company and
Anr. Vs. V.C. Bhatuda & Ors, 2014 (1) R.A.J. 274 (Del) from para 23 onwards.
Reliance is also placed on the case laws discussed in para 24 and para 25 of
the Bristol Myers Squibb Company (supra), which are M/s Jawahar Engineering
Company vs. Jawahar Engineers Pvt. Ltd., (1983) PTC 207 and Mars Incorporated
vs. Kumar Krishna Mukherjee, 2003 (26) PTC 60; 2003 (2) R.A.J. 321 (Del). It
is argued that in M/s Jawahar Engineering Company (supra), this Court has
clearly held that "when an injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the
threat should have become a reality before the injunction and it can even be
sought for a threat that is CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 6 still to materialize.
An injunction being prohibitive in nature is intended to prevent something
that is likely to happen." It is further argued that in Mars Incorporated
(supra), this Court has also held in para 21 of the said judgment that the
plaintiff need not wait and watch for opening of the business etc by the
defendant and take recourse under the principle of Quia Timet Action. It is
also argued that in State Trading Corporation of India Limited vs. Government
of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, 63 (1996) DLT 971, the Court has
clearly observed that "If the determination of jurisdiction of the Court is a
question of fact or mixed question of fact and law requiring evidence to be
adduced before recording a finding, the determination of the question may in
appropriate, cases be liable to be postponed till after the determination of
all or several other issues if the evidence to be adduced by the parties may
be common on the issue of jurisdiction and such other issues."
9\. It is also argued that there is no doubt that the burden to prove its case
upon the plaintiff is more severe wherein there is a threat to the
infringement of its trade mark than where the trademarks are actually
infringed and since it is a mixed question of law and fact, the plaint cannot
be rejected at this stage and has relied on the findings of Single Judge of
this Court in L.G.
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 7 Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Bharat Bhogilal
Patel, 2012(6) R.A.J. 234. It is argued that learned Single Judge has also
relied on the decision in the case M/s Jawahar Engineering Company (supra)
and, thereafter, held as under:-
> "43. The said threat perception per se also cannot also be said to be acting
> as an escape route to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts by just averring
> so in the plaint. The judgments rendered in the Jawahar (supra) and Pfizer
> (supra) as well as the observations made herein have to be read in the
> context. The threats are accepted by the courts for the purposes of
> invocation of jurisdiction as a mixed question of fact and law when there
> are some facts indicating towards likelihood of the perfection of the said
> threats or furtherance of the threats becoming reality. The said nexus of
> the initial facts will allow the court to determine the likelihood aspect in
> such threat and will lead to the court drawing the inference treating it as
> a mixed question of fact and law.
> 44\. Thus, the real test would be when the court seized of such a matter is
> under doubt as to whether there is a possibility of threat becoming reality
> though the possibility of the same not becoming the reality is also not
> ruled out. In such cases, the question of jurisdiction on the basis of
> apprehension becomes a mixed question of fact and law and the same is thus
> deferred until the establishment of further facts in the trial."
10\. It is also argued by learned counsel for the plaintiffs that at this
stage, the plaintiffs are not required to elaborately disclose the extent of
the business the defendants are likely to carry on or name its customers to
whom the product be sold especially when the plaintiff's case is based on quia
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 8 timet action. It is argued that the averments in
the plaint which shows quia timet action are prima facie sufficient to show
that the defendants are planning to carry out their business within the
jurisdiction of this Court and so the cause of action has arisen within the
jurisdiction of this Court. The plaintiffs have also relied on the findings of
this Court para 31 in Bristol Myers Squibb Company (supra) wherein this Court
has held as under:-
> "31. It is not necessary at this stage, for the Plaintiff to name the
> particular customers of Defendants 1 and 2 to whom the product is to be sold
> since what is expressed is only an apprehension of "offer for sale". At this
> stage, the Plaintiff can at best refer to the fact that Defendant 2 supplies
> oncology APIs to various generic companies and that the said APIs are sold
> in Delhi. The apprehension that such oncology APIs may in the near future
> include the infringing product which is also an oncology API cannot, in the
> circumstances, be characterised as lacking credibility and having been
> asserted merely to attract the jurisdiction of the Court. The above
> averments in the present plaint, which is in a quia timet action, are prima
> facie sufficient to show that Defendant No.2 "carries on business" in Delhi
> and that the prima facie the cause of action arises within the jurisdiction
> of this Court."
11\. It is submitted that since regarding the existence of a territorial
jurisdiction in respect of quia timet action is a mixed question of law and
fact, the plaint cannot be rejected at this stage, and therefore, this issue
be decided only after the evidences are being led in the case.
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 9
12\. It is however argued by learned counsel for the defendants that the
pleadings are misconceived and the plaint has been cleverly drafted in order
to take recourse to quia timet action by the plaintiffs. It is argued that
such action is preventive in nature and is an example of precautionary justice
intended to prevent apprehended wrong before the wrong is being done, if
proved. So, it is argued that even in the case of quia timet action, the
plaintiff is required to show the actual extended threat which needs
protection. It is also required to show a strong case of probability that the
apprehended mischief will in fact arise, inducing the Court to intervene to
prevent such an injury. It is submitted that a mere possibility of injury does
not give rise to cause of action unless the threat be certain or imminent and
has relied on para 6 and para 8 of Kuldip Singh vs. Subhash Chander Jain and
Ors, (2000) 4 SCC 50.
13\. It is submitted that in this case the plaintiffs have failed to show that
there was any imminent danger to any possible injury and thus no cause of
action has arisen in favour of the plaintiff. It is submitted that admittedly
the plaintiffs are not selling their products in Delhi and it thus has not
attained any good will in Delhi which is sine qua non to an act of passing off
and has relied on the findings in Jay Engineering Works Ltd. vs. Ramesh
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 10 Aggarwal, 135 (2006) DLT 666. It is also argued
that in fact the plaintiffs have not earned any good will in Delhi. It is
running its business in Rajasthan since July 2013 as disclosed by plaintiffs
in para 7 of the plaint, and it is unlikely that in such a short period, its
good will has travelled to Delhi. Learned counsel for the defendants has
relied on the findings in the case of Goenka Institute of Education & Research
vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka & Anr, ILR (2009) VI Delhi 415. Learned counsel has
also relied on the findings in the case of T. Arivandandam vs. T.V. Satyapal,
(1977) 4 SCC 467 and has argued that the Court has to examine the allegation
made in the plaint in a meaningful manner and also has to examine the
documents in similar manner in order to assess if any cause of action has
really arisen in favour of the plaintiff.
14\. It is further argued that the findings in the case of Bristol Myers
Squibb Company and Anr. (supra) does not apply to the facts of this case as in
that case in para 16, the defendant no. 2 in its written statement had
admitted that it had customers located at Delhi. At the time when ex-parte
injunction order was obtained by the plaintiff from this Court on 28th March,
2000, the judgment in the case of Kuldeep Singh vs. Subhash Chander Jain &
Ors, (2000) 4 SCC 50 was not brought to its notice. It is submitted that
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 11 findings in the case of Pfizer Products (supra)
are also not applicable in the present case since in that case, the plaintiff
had alleged that the defendant had applied for registration in Delhi while in
the present case, there is no such allegation. It is submitted that this Court
has no territorial jurisdiction and the suit is liable to be dismissed.
15\. I have heard the arguments and perused the relevant records of both the
parties.
16\. There is no dispute to the proposition of law that while deciding the
issue relating to the jurisdiction at the initial stage, the Court has to rely
on the averments in the plaint and the plaint is needed to be read as a whole
to find out whether it discloses such facts which shows that a part of cause
of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court.
17\. From the pleadings, it is apparent that this suit has been filed by the
plaintiffs on its threat perception arising from the website of the defendants
as well as an interview wherein the defendants disclosed and discussed its
plan to launch its product throughout India including Delhi. In Shilpa
Medicare Limited vs. Brystol Myers Squibb Company and Ors, FAO(OS) 96/2014,
decided on 30.07.2015, this Court has held as under:-
" 14. The suit filed by the respondents is by way of a quia timet action,
which visualizes apprehended injury. No CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 12 doubt,
there are important constraints placed upon a plaintiff who brings such an
action, the most prominent one being that the burden of proving such
apprehension is heavy. Yet, the fact remains that the suit is based to a large
extent on the threat. Now how does a court evaluate a threat to adjudge if it
is justified, in the context of a dispute about its territorial jurisdiction?
This is to be seen from the requirements of what has to be pleaded in a
plaint, and what can legitimately be seen when a dispute (with regard to the
territorial jurisdiction) arises. The court necessarily has to confine its
gaze to the plaint and the documents filed with it......."
18\. The Jurisdiction of Courts in cases of infringement of the trade mark and
passing off, has to be determined in view of Section 134 of Trade Mark Act,
1999. In cases of infringement of the trade mark in addition to the provisions
of Section 20 of Civil Procedure Code (CPC), the plaintiffs have the
additional benefit of filing the suit within the jurisdiction of the Court
wherein it is actually residing or carrying on business or personally working
for gain. In this case, the plaintiffs in the plaint have not alleged anywhere
that it is carrying on its business within the jurisdiction of this Court. The
plaintiffs also do not have its registered office within the jurisdiction of
this Court so this Court has no territorial jurisdiction in terms of Section
134 of the Trademark Act, 1999. As regards the jurisdiction of this Court
under Section 20 CPC is concerned, the plaintiffs are required to show that
the defendants are residing or carrying on its business within the
jurisdiction of CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 13 this Court or that a cause of
action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court. The plaintiffs in
para 32 of the plaint have averred as under:-
> "32. That the cause of action arose in favour of the Plaintiffs and against
> the Defendants in Week of January, 2015 when the Plaintiff's representative
> came across to the articles on the internet wherein the Defendants has
> clearly stated its intention to enter the Delhi Market with its "GRENADE XXX
> RESERVE BOTTLE" rum product. The cause of action further arose when
> Plaintiff searched on the website of the Defendants and found the impugned
> product was shown and found to be an outright fraudulent imitation of the
> Plaintiffs' GRENADE DARK RUM BOTTLE. The cause of action further arose when
> the Plaintiff's representative found the brochure, of the Defendants and in
> the brochure the impugned product is clearly visible and mentioned. The said
> cause of action is a continuing one and continues to subsist till the
> Defendants, their distributors, retailers, agents, assigns in business etc.
> are restrained from carrying on their illegal trade activities of selling
> impugned bottles.
19\. As regards jurisdiction, it is averred in para 33 of the plaint
reproduced as under:-
> "33. This Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try the present
> suit since the Defendants are offering to supply and sell the infringing
> goods within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. This scale of business
> and activity of the defendants are not known at present and it is
> apprehended as being highly likely that the product sold under the impugned
> mark and designs-
"GRENADE RESERVE BOTTLE" will be made available in New Delhi. The website of
the Defendants as well as information in the newspaper publications reveal
that the CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 14 Defendants are about to launch their
products under the impugned designed bottle and mark in New Delhi. There is a
reasonable apprehension that the Defendants are likely to sell their products
bearing the impugned design bottle within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court. Thus this Hon'ble Court has the necessary jurisdiction. Therefore, the
cause of action has arisen at Delhi.
(emphasis supplied)
20\. In the case of T. Arivandandam vs. T.V. Satyapal and Anr, AIR 1977 SC
2421, the Supreme Court has held as under:-
> "5. ....................... reading of the plaint it is manifestly
> vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to
> sue, he should exercise his power under Order VII Rule 11, C.P.C. taking
> care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clear
> drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud at
> the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under Order X, C.P.C.
> An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits. The trial Courts
> would insist imperatively on examining the party at the first hearing so
> that bogus litigation can be shot down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code
> is also resourceful enough to meet such men, and must be triggered against
> them......."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 21\. The Court therefore has to read the plaint in a meaningful manner and
> see whether the cause of action has arisen within its jurisdiction or not.
Here, the Court is not concerned whether any cause of action has arisen or not
in favour of the plaintiffs but it has to determine whether the cause of
action, if any, has arisen in favour of the plaintiffs within the jurisdiction
of CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 15 this Court or not. The plaintiff's case is
based on the principle of quia timet action and it states that the defendants
are likely to expand its business and also likely to start selling its
products in Delhi. The courts, in the Bristol Myers Squibb company and Anr
(supra) and Pfizer Products (supra) and other cases, has held that the quia
timet action gives the cause of action. The question is whether that the
plaintiffs have been able to show that any part of cause of action to sue the
defendants on the basis of quia timet has arisen within the jurisdiction of
this Court. The findings in the Bristol Myers Squibb company and anr. (supra)
are not applicable on the facts of this case because in that case, the
defendant itself had admitted that it had its customers in Delhi and also the
plaintiff had pleaded that the defendant no. 3 was having its factory within
the jurisdiction of this Court. In this case, however, the plaintiffs have not
pleaded anywhere that the defendants are carrying on their business in Delhi
or have their registered office in Delhi. Admittedly, both the plaintiffs and
the defendants had their registered office as well as manufacturing units
outside Delhi. It is also noteworthy that both of them are dealing in the
products which is controlled under the Excise Act and they need the excise
licences for doing their business in any State. It is not the case of the
plaintiffs that defendants have applied for obtaining any CS(COMM) No.681/2016
Page 16 excise licence for sale of its products within the jurisdiction of
Delhi. The peculiar nature of the business of both the parties show that none
of the party has the liberty to start its business at any time in any part of
the country including Delhi as they need to first get a license for such sale.
Even if the defendants have plans to expand its business to Delhi, it cannot
do so because it need excise permission and in the absence of allegation or
contention that such an excise licence has been sought, it cannot be said that
there is imminent apprehension to the plaintiffs.
22\. Although principle of quia timet action gives a cause of action yet in
the case of Kuldeep Singh (supra), the Supreme Court has held as under:-
> "6. A quia timet action is a bill in equity. It is an action preventive in
> nature and a specie of precautionary justice intended to prevent apprehended
> wrong or anticipated mischief and not to undo a wrong or mischief when it
> has already been done. In such an action the Court, if convinced, may
> interfere by appointment of receiver or by directing security to be
> furnished or by issuing an injunction or any other remedial process. In
> Fletcher v. Bealey, Mr. Justice Pearson explained the law as to actions quia
> timet as follows :-
There are at least two necessary ingredients for a Quia timet action. There
must, if no actual damage is proved, be proof of imminent danger, and there
must also be proof that the apprehended damage will, if it comes, be very
substantial. I should almost say it must be proved that it will be
irreparable, because, if the danger is not proved to be so imminent that no
one can doubt that, if the remedy is delayed the damage will be suffered, I
think it must be shown that, if the damage does occur CS(COMM) No.681/2016
Page 17 at any time, it will come in such a way and under such circumstances
that it will be impossible for the plaintiff to protect himself against it if
relief is denied to him in a Quia timet action.
7\. xxx xxx xxx
8\. In our opinion a nuisance actually in existence stands on a different
footing than a possibility of nuisance or a future nuisance. An actually
existing nuisance is capable of being assessed in terms of its quantum and the
relief which will protect or compensate the plaintiff consistently with the
injury caused to his rights is also capable of being formulated. In case of a
future nuisance, a mere possibility of injury will not provide the plaintiff
with a cause of action unless the threat be so certain or imminent that an
injury actionable in law will arise unless prevented by an injunction. The
Court may not require proof of absolute certainty or a proof beyond reasonable
doubt before it may interfere; but a strong case of probability that the
apprehended mischief will in fact arise must be shown by the plaintiff. In
other words, a future nuisance to be actionable must be either imminent or
likely to cause such damage as would be irreparable once it is allowed to
occur. There may be yet another category of actionable future nuisance when
the likely act of the defendant is inherently dangerous or injurious such as
digging a ditch across a highway or in the vicinity of a childrens school or
opening a shop dealing with highly inflammable products in the midst of a
residential locality." (emphasis supplied)
23\. As discussed above in the present case, there is no certain or imminent
threat or injury in favour of the plaintiffs which needs interference by the
Court especially when no part of such cause of action has arisen in Delhi. The
plaintiffs are not running its business in Delhi and the defendants also not
having its registered office in Delhi or having CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 18
manufacturing unit in Delhi or have applied for excise licence or for
registration of its trademark in Delhi. In the cases relied upon by the
plaintiffs, clearly the defendants had existence in Delhi and it was on that
fact that the Court had continued with the suit.
24\. In the case of United Phosphorus limited vs. Ajay Garg & Anr, 2015 (63)
PTC 188 (Del) while placing reliance on Banyan Tree Holding (P) Ltd vs A.
Murali Krishna Reddy & Anr 2010 (42) PTC361, this Court had held as under:-
> 42\. This Court holds that jurisdiction of the forum court does not get
> attracted merely on the basis of interactivity of the website which is
> accessible in the forum state. The degree of the interactivity apart, the
> nature of the activity permissible and whether it results in a commercial
> transaction has to be examined. For the "effects" test to apply, the
> Plaintiff must necessarily plead and show prima facie that the specific
> targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm
> to the Plaintiff within the forum state. For the purposes of a passing off

25\. The settled law thus is that some connection needed to be shown with
forum state of the activities of the defendant. The Courts are not to merely
follow the averments of the pleadings. It can judge its correctness relying on
the various other averments in the plaint and the documents supporting it.
26\. Although in paragraph 33 of the plaint, the plaintiffs have stated that
defendants are 'offering to supply and selling the infringing goods within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court', however, nowhere in the plaint,
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 20 the plaintiffs have stated that defendants are
selling its product in Delhi. However, it is a fact that the product of the
defendants which is liquor cannot be sold without an excise licence and the
plaintiffs have not pleaded anywhere that the defendants hold an excise
license for sale in Delhi. The plaintiff's case is based on the contention
that the defendants are planning to sell its product in Delhi. The averments
itself thus show that no products of the defendants and the plaintiffs are
sold in Delhi. The plaintiffs thus have not been able to show prima facie that
there is any infringement or passing off his trade mark by the defendants in
Delhi. Even for quia timet action, the plaintiffs have to show that there is a
strong possibility of the defendants selling its product in Delhi which is
likely to cause injury to its business and trade mark. The plaintiffs have
failed to prima facie show its presence in Delhi or any goodwill in Delhi.
27\. The Court observing the contradictions in the pleadings in the case of
United Phosphorus limited vs. Ajay Garg & Anr, 2015 (63) PTC 188 (Del),
reached to the conclusion that the plaintiff was doing the forum shopping
observed as under:-
> 45\. Reading of the paragraph 28, more particularly the underlined portion,
> would show that a positive assertion has been made that the defendants are
> actively marketing and offering for sale of Acephate 97% dry flow soluble
> granules CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 21 including at Delhi. This assertion is
> contradictory and misleading. Once the plaintiff was in possession of the
> licence of the defendant no.2, a copy of which was filed, it would show that
> this assertion in paragraph 28 is false for the reason that the licence is
> only for export and, thus, to say that the defendants are actively marketing
> and offering for sale of Acephate 97% is a false statement.
> 46\. It has been averred that defendants have an office at Connaught Place.
> Having used the words "defendants‟ by the plaintiff, a duty is cast upon the
> plaintiff even at the initial stage to place a document on record or some
> material to make good such an averment especially when they have hired the
> services of an investigator. The defendant no.2 has taken a categorical
> stand that they do not have any office at Connaught Place and neither any
> business has been conducted by them through defendant no.1 in respect to
> Acephate 97%."
28\. In the case of Jay Engineering Works ltd. vs. Ramesh Aggarwal, 135 (2006)
DLT 666, this Court has also held that where the defendants are not residing
or carrying on its business within the jurisdiction of this Court, this Court
cannot be said to have any territorial jurisdiction under Section 20 of the
CPC for entertaining any suit for infringement of the trade mark or for
passing off.
29\. From the above discussions, it is apparent that the plaint does not
disclose that any part of the cause of action has arisen in Delhi. The
plaintiffs seem to be indulging in the forum shopping by resorting to a clever
drafting. From the averments in the plaint, it is clear that the plaintiff has
no existence in Delhi. Neither do they have their office in Delhi nor they are
CS(COMM) No.681/2016 Page 22 indulging into manufacturing of their product in
Delhi. They are dealing with the supply of excisable liquor and they do not
also have any licence for supply of their product in Delhi. The defendants are
also not having their office including the registered office within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor do they have a manufacturing unit in Delhi.
They have also not applied for the registration of their trade mark within the
jurisdiction of this Court nor have they applied for obtaining any excise
licence for supply/sale of their products within jurisdiction of this Court.
No part of cause of action has thus arisen within the jurisdiction of this
Court. The Court, therefore, has no territorial jurisdiction. The plaint is
returned to the plaintiffs for filing in the Court of appropriate
jurisdiction. In view of the above, the interim order dated 23.03.2015 stands
vacated.
The Registrar is directed to do the needful.
The petition along with pending applications stands disposed of in these
terms.
