3\. When the assessee raised objections before the DRP, the DRP directed the
AO/TPO to exclude the comparable companies, viz., E - zest solutions ltd.,
Kals Information Systems Ltd., and Tata Elxsi Ltd.
3.1 After applying the average margin of the remaining 16 comparables, as per
the directions of the DRP, the arm's length price was reworked out at Rs.
18,77,04,788/ - and the adjustment u/s 92CA(3) for the year under
consideration at Rs. 2,75,04,986/ - instead of Rs. 2,86,24,167/- made by TPO.
4\. The AO, thereafter, passed final assessment order u/s 143(3) rws 147
r.w.s. 92CA(3) rws 144C of the Act, on 27/10/2017, against which, the assessee
is in appeal before us raising the following grounds of appeal:
> " 1. The Learned(Ld.) Dispute resolutions panel (DRP)/ Assessing Officer
> (AO) are erroneous in law and on the facts of the case.
> 2\. The DRP/AO ought to have accepted the profit margin (OP/OC) of 6.27%
> adopted by the appellant as having complied with the arm's length principle.
> 3\. The Ld DRP/AO are not justified in law in considering wrong comparables
> and consequently arriving at an arm's length margin of 24.11% after making
> Working capital adjustment of 1.39% and thereby making an adjustment of Rs.
> 2,75,04,986/ -.
> 4\. The AO erred in not giving full effect to the directions of Ld. DRP in
> respect of excluding the company Wipro Limited (Seg) as a comparable company
> in computation of operating margin of comparable companies, which resulted
> in increase of margin by 0.33% (i.e. 24.11% less 23.78%) and thereby making
> an excess adjustment of Rs.5,03,127/- (i.e.Rs.2,75,04,986/- less
> Rs.2,70,011,859/-).
> 5\. The Ld. DRP/AO erred in not accepting assessee's contention of rejecting
> the following 8 Companies inter alia on the grounds of High Turnover,
> Functional Dis -similarity, ownership of intangible assets and non-
> availability of segmental information relating to software development in
> case of companies engaged in both software development and product
> development.

> 1\. Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd
> 2\. Bodh tree Ltd 3 Celestial Biolabs Ltd
> 4\. Infosys Technologies Ltd 5 GS Global Ltd 6 Persistent Systems Ltd 7
> Quintegra Solutions Ltd 8 Softsol India Limited
> 6\. The DRP/AO erred in confirming an adjustment when the appellant company
> was claiming exemption u/s 10B and hence there is no intention to shift
> profits outside India and more so when the tax rates in USA where the AE is
> located, were higher than those prevailing in India.
> 7\. Any other ground that may be urged at the time of hearing with the prior
> approval of the Hon'ble ITAT.
4.1 The assessee has filed a petition for Admission of following Additional
grounds:
> 1\. The Ld. TPO / DRP erred in computing /confirming the margin of appellant
> company by treating Fringe Benefit Tax("FBT") as an operating expense, which
> resulted in reducing the margin of the Appellant company from 6.27% to
> 5.92%.
> 2\. The Ld. TPO/DRP are not justified in law in considering FBT as an
> operating expense in case of Appellant company as the td. TPO himself did
> not consider the FBT as an operating expense while computing the margins of
> comparables. "
5\. Out of the said grounds, Ground Nos. 1, 2 & 3 are general in nature, the
assessee has not pressed ground No. 4, as the AO already addressed the issue
with the directions of DRP. Hence, all these grounds are dismissed.
6\. In ground No. 5, the assessee object to exclude the following 8 companies
as comparables from the list of comparables:
> 1\. Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd
> 2\. Bodh tree Ltd 3 Celestial Biolabs Ltd
> 4\. Infosys Technologies Ltd 5 LGS Global Ltd 6 Persistent Systems Ltd  6
> ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
7 Quintegra Solutions Ltd 8 Softsol India Limited 7 As regards Avani Cincom
Technologies Ltd, AR submitted that this company cannot be a comparable to the
assessee company as the company is into both segments product and software
services and further, segment-wise data is not available. The TPO included
this company in the final set of comparables only on the basis of information
obtained under section 133(6) of the Act. He relied on the following cases:
> 1\. Invensys Development Centre (P) Ld., Vs. aCIT, [2015] 68 SOT 247 (Hyd.)
> 2\. United Online Software Development (India) (P) Ltd., Vs. ITO [2016] 69
> Taxmann.com 446 (Hyd.) 7.1 The ld. DR, on the other hand, submitted that the
> assessee objects for inclusion of the said company on the ground that it has
> products and offers services and segmental information is not available.
> However, it has only one segment as seen from the annual report. The
> information obtained u/s 133(6) was shared with the assessee also by the
> TPO.
7.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd., by placing reliance on the judgement of
jurisdictional tribunal in the case of Invensys Development Centre P Ltd.
directed the AO/TPO to exclude the said company from the list of comparables
while computing arm's length price. Following the said decision, we direct the
AO to exclude the said company as comparable.
8\. As regards Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., ld. AR submitted that this company
cannot be a comparable to the assessee company as it is engaged in the
business of software products and it also provides open end to end web
solutions, software consultancy, design and  7 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen
Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
development of software. It is functio nally different from the assessee
company and thus needs to be eliminated from the list of comparables. He
relied on the following cases:
1\. Cash Edge India (P) Ltd. Vs. ITO [2014] 151 ITD 717.
8.1 Ld. DR, on the other hand, submitted that there is signif icant employee
cost and software development expenses and there are no intangibles indicating
products.
8.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd. directed to exclude the said company by
observing as under:
> 6\. Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. (Seg.) 6.1 The ld. AR objecting to the said
> company as comparable, relied upon the decision of the ITAT, Hyderabad in
> assessee's own case for AY 2005-06 wherein the Bench held as follows:
> "20. The Learned AR submitted that since the aforesaid company fails the RPT
> filter it cannot be treated as a comparable. The learned DR supported the
> order of the TPO.
> 21\. We have considered the submissions of the parties and perused the
> materials on record. The ground on which the learned AR seeks for exclusion
> of the aforesa id company is, its related party transaction as a percentage
> to the total revenue is 34.68% which is more than the accept/reject matrix
> of more than 25% fixed by the TPO. It is to be noted that in final filters
> adopted by the TPO in para 9.7 of his order he himself has excluded
> companies having RPT of more than 25%. We, therefore, direct the Assessing
> Officer/TPO to examine this aspect and exclude it from the list of
> comparables if the assessee's contention is found to be correct.
> 6.2 The ld. AR also relied upon the following cases:
> 1\. ITAT Delhi in case of Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No. 5848/D/2012
> for AY 2008-09  8 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
> 6.3 It is to be noted that in the case of 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd,

> 6.4 Ld. AR submitted that this company is engaged in providing open and end

Respectfully following the said decision, we direct AO/TPO to analyse this
comparable with the submissions of the assessee after giving them an
opportunity of being heard. In case, this comparable is found to be into
software products, it may be eliminated from the list of comparables.
9\. As regards Celestial Biolabs Ltd., ld. AR submitted that this company
cannot be a comparable to the assessee compan y as it is engaged in R&D
activities and renders services to specific sectors. It provides contract
research services and is also diversified int o  9 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen
Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
marketing and manufacturing activities. It is functionally different from the
assessee company, thus, it has to be excluded from the final list of
comparables. He relied on the following case:
1\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Vs. DCIT [2014] 42 Taxmann.com 333 ( Bangalore -
Trib.) 9.1 The ld. DR, on the other hand, submitted that in the case of this
company, unless R&D expenditure is shown to have material impact on the profit
margin, the comparable could not be excluded.
9.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the Bangalore Tribunal in the case of 3DPLM software Solutions
(supra) direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said company by observing as under:
> "9.5 Apart from relying on the afore cited judicial decisions in the matter
> (supra), the assessee has brought on record substantial factual evidence to
> establish that this company is functionally dis-similar and different from
> the assessee in the case on hand and is therefore not comparable and also
> that the findings rendered in the cited decisions for the earlier years i.e.
> Assessment Year 2007-08 is applicable for this year also. We agree with the
> submissions of the assessee that this company is functionally different from
> the assessee. It has also been so held by co-ordinate benches of this
> Tribunal in the assessee's own case for Assessment Year 2007 -08 (supra) as
> well as in the case of Triology E-Business Software India (P.) Ltd. (supra).
> In view of the fact that the functional profile of and other parameters of

We notice that the decision of the ITAT Bengaluru bench cann ot be relied as
it refers to AY 2007-08 and it is based on several other decisions. We notice
that similar to assessee, Celestial Bio Labs also offers several services to
its AEs and since we are determining with ALP based on TNMM, we consider the
avera ge margin of all the  10 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyd.
several activities carried on by the assessee. On a compartmentalizing two
profit making companies with several activities, we can compare the end
result, unless they are into product or highly diversified or some activities
which will modify the profit making ability of the organization. In this case,
we do not see any reason to interfere with the selection process. Therefore,
the objection of the assessee to exclude the said company is hereby rejected.
10\. As regards Infosys Technologies Ltd, ld. AR submitted that this company
cannot be a comparable case to the assessee company as it is to be rejected
based on its size, huge turnover, brand value, scale of operation, owning of
intangibles and diversified operations. He relied on the following cases:
> 1\. Invensys Development Centre (P) Ltd. (supra)
> 2\. Adaptec (India) P. Ltd. Vs. ACIT [2014] 44 Taxmann.com 236 (Hyd. Trib)

Following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said company
as comparable from the list of comparables.
11\. As regard LGS Global Ltd., the ld. AR submitted that this company cannot
be a comparable company to the assessee company, as this company is engaged in
rendering consultancy services, BPO, testing services and application
maintenance outsourcing. The segmental data is not available for comparability
analysis therefore the company is to be rejected from the final list of
comparables. He relied on the following cases:
1\. Cash Edge India (P) Ltd. (supra )
2\. United Online Software Development (India) Ltd. (supra) 11.1 The ld. DR on
the other hand, on the objections on LGS Global Ltd that segmental data is not
available, submitted that the range of services (consultancy services, BPO,
testing services and application maintenance) rendered by the said company are
very similar to that of the assessee and the said company operates only in one
segment and hence, the objection is not sustainable.
11.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd. directed to exclude the said company by
observing as under:
> "8. LGS Global Ltd.
> 8.1 Objecting to the said company as comparable, ld. AR submitted that this

principle, software products cannot be considered as comparables for software
services compa ny. The ld. AR relied upon the decision of the ITAT Delhi Bench
in case of Cash Edge India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) wherein the bench held as
follows:
> 15\. As regards the argument of Ld. A.R. regarding exclusion of LGS Global
> Ltd., Avani Cincon, Kals Information Systems and Bothtree Consultants, we

Following the said decision, we direct AO to determine the service and product
details from this company and if in case it is found that it is into product,
this company will have to be excluded from the list of comparables."
12\. With regard to Persistent Systems Ltd, the ld. AR submitted that this
company cannot be a comparable company to assessee company, as this company is
engaged in software product designing and analytical services. It is also
incurred R&D expenses. The segmental data is not available for comparison
purpose, therefore, the company is to be rejected from the final list of the
comparables. He relied on the following cases:
1\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra)
2\. United Online Software Development (India) P. Ltd. (supra) 12.1 The ld. DR
submitted that the said company is not into products and it only deploys
certain platforms to render IT Services. Therefore, the objections of the
assessee on the services offered by the company are not tenable. DRP examined
the comparable at length at pages 7 to 10 of its order and gave detailed
reasons for retention of the said comparable.
12.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd. directed to exclude the said company by
observing as under:

16
> ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.

Following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said company
from the list of comparables.
13\. As regards Quintegra Solutions Ltd., the ld. AR of the assessee submitted
that this company cannot be a comparable, as it is engaged in product
engineering services and is not purely a software development service
provider. This company is also engaged in proprietary software products and
R&D activities. Hence, this company may be excluded from the list of
comparables. He relied on the following cases:
> 1\. 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd. Vs. DCIT (supra)
> 2\. United Online Software Development (India) P. Ltd. (supra)  17 ITA No.
> 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
13.1 The ld. DR submitted that the assessee argues that it is a company
offering product engineering services and having proprietary software products
as well as R&D activities, but, it is subm itted that unless the assessee
establishes quantitatively that the R&D activity has significant impact on the
profit margin, the same cannot be excluded.
13.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd. directed to exclude the said company by
observing as under:
> "10. Qunitegra Solutions Ltd.
> 10.1 Objecting to the aforesaid company as comparable, the ld. AR relied on

Following the said decision, we direct the AO/TPO to exclude the said company
from the list of comparables.
14\. As regards the Softsol India Ltd., the ld. AR submitted that this company
cannot be a comparable case to assessee company because RPT is over 15% in
this case, i.e. 1 8.3%. He relied on the following case:
1\. United Online Software Development (India) P. Ltd. (supra) 14.1 The ld. DR
submitted that the assessee seeks exclusion of the said company as it fails
RPT filter at 15%. He submitted that the standard RPT filter is applied at 25%
and the assessee cannot seek selective application of this filter in case of
one comparabl e.
14.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. We
find that the coordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of United Online
Software Development (India) (P) Ltd. directed to exclude the said company by
observing as under:
> "11. Softsol India Ltd.
> 11.1 Objecting to the said company as comparable, the ld. AR relied on the

We notice that assessee has adopted 10% RPT whereas TPO adopted 25% filter for
RPT. Generally, the %age of RPT is determined based on the availability of
comparables. When the comparables are more, the RPT filter is adopted at
minimum level whereas when the comparables are less, the RPT % are fixed
liberally. Generally, it is selected between 15% or 25% depending upon the
availability of comparables. In the given case, TPO has selected 19
comparables. Therefore, it shows that comparables are reasonably more, hence,
TPO could have applied 15%. In the given case, out of 19 comparables, assessee
accepted only 7 and balance it objected. Therefore, in our conside red view,
in the restricted atmosphere of selection of comparables, the %age should be
25% not 15%. The more we restrict, chances of loosing reasonable
comparability. Therefore, we reject the contention of the assessee and
exclusion of the said comparable by the assessee from the list of comparables,
is herby rejected.

ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
15\. We therefore direct the Assessing Officer /TPO to determine the ALP
keeping in view our directions given hereinabove and if on such determination
the price charged by the assessee for its international transaction is found
to be within the arms length then no adjustment is required to be made.
16\. As regards ground No. 6 regarding exemption u/s 10B, the assessee stated
as under:
> "21.0 Appellant Company is enjoying benefit u/s 10B and therefore it is
> incorrect to make a transfer pricing adjustment. Moreover the tax rate in

21
> ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
This view has been endorsed by the Ahmedabad Tribunal in the case of Motif
India Info tech Pvt Ltd ITA No.3043/ Ahd/2010 for A Y 2006-07.
37\. In our considered opinion, in a case where the international transaction
entered into by the assessee with the AEs giving rise to exempt income in the
hands of the assessee is to be benchmarked with the ALP determined in
accordance with the provisions of Transfer Pricing to ensure that no excess
exempt income is disclosed by the assessee and assessee is entitled for
exemption of income u/s lOA of the total income determined as per the Transfer
Pricing Provisions only and where the assessee has claimed more exempt income,
then exemption u/s lOA shall be allowed in accordance with the profit compared
as per ALP only.
38\. Keeping in view the above in mind in the instant case we find that as per
the decisions of the lower authorities the assessee has not reported any
excess exempt income from its international transactions with AE. On the other
hand as per the opinion of the lower tiuthorities in the instant case exempt
income declared by the assessee when benchmarked with the ALP determined in
accordance with the provisions of Transfer Pricing, the assessee has declared
lesser exempt income and thereby no taxable base in India was eroded.
Therefore, in our considered opinion no adjustment with the exempt income of
the assessee was required to be made as per provisions contained in Chapter X
of the Act.
Similarly in the case of "Philip Software", 119 TT J 721 (Bang.), it was held
that since the basic intention behind introducing the TP provisions in the Act
is to prevent Shifting of profits outside India, and the assessee was claiming
benefit u/s 10A of the Act, the TP provisions ought not to be applied to the
assessee.
"5.1 We have heard the rival contentions and we proceed to adjudicate on the
issues in the sequence which has been argued by the rival parties before us.
Th e learned counsel for the assessee has argued that the tax payable by it in
India is lower than the tax rate applicable to its associated enterprise in
the Netherlands. Since the assessee is availing the benefit under section 10A
of the Act, one cannot take a simplistic view on the matter of tax avoidance.
In this connection the learned Departmental Representative has drawn reference
to the proviso to section 92C(4). Relying on OECD guidelines, the DR has
mentioned that the consideration of transfer pricing should not be confused
with the consideration of problems of tax avoidance, even though transfer
pricing policies may be used  22 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt.
Ltd., Hyd.
for such purposes. In this connection, it was pointed out that by not
declaring proper profits in India, the assessee is indirectly reducing its
liability to Dividend Distribution Tax (in short 'DDT'). The Special Bench of
the Tribunal, in the case of Aztec Software & Technology Services Ltd.
(supra), has concluded that the Assessing Officer/TPO need not prove the
motive of shifting of profits outside India for making a transfer pricing
adjustment. The assessee had generally argued that one of the factors driving
any motive for shifting profits would be the difference in the tax rate in
India and the tax rate applicable to the associated enterprise in the overseas
jurisdiction. In the instant case, since the assessee was availing the benefit
under section 10A of the Act, it would be devoid of logic to argue that the
assessee had manipulated pr ices (and shifted profits) to an overseas
jurisdiction for the purpose of avoiding tax in India. The reference by the OR
to the proviso to section 92C(4) is completely out of context and irrelevant.
The DR ought to have appreciated that the proviso comes into play only once a
transfer pricing adjustment is made. By quoting OECD guidelines, the Id. DR
does not get much help. The Id. DR ought to have appreciated that what is
relevant in the Indian context are the specific provisions of the Circular No.
14/200 1. As submitted above, at para 55.5 of the said Circular, the CBDT has
clearly mentioned that the intention of the transfer pricing provisions is to
curtail avoidance of taxes by shifting profits outside India."
In the case of Cotton Naturals (J) (P.) Lt d. v. DCIT [2013] 32 taxmann.com
219 (Delhi - Trib.) the Hon'ble Delhi Tribunal held as under:
"18. We further note that assessee's profits are exempt u/s. 10B. Hence, there
is no case that assessee would benefit by shifting profits outside India. This
vi ew is supported by Bangalore Tribunal decision in this case Philips
Software Centre (P.) Ltd. v. Asstt. CIT [2008J 26 SOT 226 and Mumbai Tribunal
in the case of ITO v. Zydus Altana HealthCare (P.) Ltd. [2011J 44 SOT 132."I
In the case of CIT v. Lumax Industries Ltd [2013]36 taxman.com 380 (Delhi -
Trib) "The TPO has nowhere made out a case that profit was shifted from a
higher tax jurisdiction to a lower tax jurisdiction. In fact, there was no, as
there could have been no, motive for any such shifting of profits at the hands
of the assessee company and there could have been no reason for a majority
stakeholder in India {the assessee} to over pay even a single paisa to the
minority stakeholder in Japan {Stanley}. The TPO fell in error in ignoring the
position that it is if and only if it stands proved that  23 ITA No.
2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
there was manipulation of prices to avoid taxes in India, that the transfer
pricing provisions of the Act can be invoked. Now, obviously, once the
shareholding of Stanley was only to the extent of 19.51%, the assessee company
would not have avoided taxes by shifting profits to Stanley. That transfer
pricing regulations in India have been brought on the statute book with the
intent of preserving tax base in India and preventing tax evasion through
manipulation of pricing of inter company transactions, is also evident from
CBDT Circular No.14/2001, providing the Explanatory Notes on provisions
relating to direct taxes with respect to Finance Act, 2001. As per this
Circular {also brought to the notice of the Assessing Officer by the assessee
by way of its submissions dated 20.12.2006, copy at APB 189-218, relevant
portion at page 194, para 3.1 ):-
"The profits derived by such enterprises carrying on business in India can be
controlled by the multinational gr oup, by manipulating the prices charged and
paid in such intra -group transactions, thereby leading to erosion of tax
revenues The basic intention underlying the new transfer pricing regulations
is to prevent shifting out of profits by manipulating prices c harged or paid
in international transactions, thereby eroding the country's tax base. "
21.3 In addition to the above reliance is also placed on the following case
laws where the above view was held by the various Benches of Hon'ble Tribunal.
i) "ITO vs. Zydus Altana Healthcare {P} Limited", 44 SOT 132 (Mumbai)
ii) ii "ACIT vs. Dufon Laboratories", 39 SOT 59 (Mumbai) and
iii) "IJM (India) Infrastructure", 281TR {Trib} 176 {Hyd} On the above facts
we would like to rely on the recent decision by Mumbai Tribunal in the DClT v.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd ITA No: 7513/M/2010 for the AY 2005 -06 wherein
it was held "54. For the above discussion, the assessee's support to the
impugned order on both counts is found to be correct. The AO erred in not
himself examining the issue of TP and with the approval of the Id. CIT, made a
reference to the TPO u/s 92CA(1) of the Act; that the AO as well as the Id. C
IT(A) failed to apply their mind to the TP Report filed by the assessee, or to
any other material or information or document furnished. The TPO made an
adjustment which was incorporated by the A O in the assessment order. Thereby.
the AD as well as the Id. C IT(A)  24 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt.
Ltd., Hyd.
did not discharge necessary respective judicial functions conferred on them
under sections 92C and 92CA of the Act. Further, the assessee is also correct
in contending that no TP adjustment can be made in a case like the present
one, where the assessee enjoys u/s 10A or 80HHE of the Act, or where the tax
rate in the country of the Associated Enterprises is higher than the rate of
tax in India and where the establishment of tax avoidance or manipulation of
prices or establishment of shifting of profits is not possible."
22.0 In view of what has been stated above we pray the Hon'ble Bench to grant
relief as per the grounds of appeal and submissions made as above."
16.1 The ld. DR, on the other hand, subm itted that merely because the
assessee is eligible for exemption u/s 10B, it would not establish that there
was no shifting of profit. The adjustments to ALP are not subject to exemption
u/s 10B. Besides, as per the TP law in India, intentions need not be
established and the ALP needs to be worked out as per the methods specified by
CBDT as per the provisions in the IT Act, 1961 and the IT Rules.
16.2 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. The
respective coordinate bench of I TAT has opined that when favourable exemption
is available to the assessee in India, assessee may not shift the profit to
other countries. This is general criteria that multinational companies will
plan their business activities to retain maximum profit in the country in
which less tax payment is there. But it is not the only criteria for decision
making. The decision making and shareholder appetite of expansion will not
remain same for all the time or countries. Irrespective of profit making
ability and exemption available in the country of operation, the actual profit
making ability cannot be determined. Irrespective of situation, the transfer
price of the global market and the corporates must be within the band of
pricing. It cannot fluctuate. It can be determined or evaluated only by means
of comparing pricing pattern of Indian market and global market. When it is
found that it is within the b and  25 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt.
Ltd., Hyd.
of prices adopted globally, no need of making any adjustment. It cannot be
restricted based on the prevailin g tax rate in other countries. As we said
earlier, the tax saving alone cannot be a decision making process to restrict
any TP adjustment. Therefore, ground No., 6 is dismissed.
17\. As regards additional grounds regarding FBT, the ld. AR submitted that
the TPO has traced the FBT as an expenditure and the margin determined by him
are less compared to other comparables. The TPO while considering analysis of
comparables, he has deducted the FBT from their operating expenses. He prayed
before us that the FBT expenses which are not allowed as deductible expenses,
the same should be removed while calculating profit of margin of the assessee
or to the method adopted for the comparables.
17.1 The ld. DR filed written submissions wherein it was stated as under:
> 3\. On the ground of treating FBT is treating as expenditure, it is humbly
> submitted that it is essential to know about the objective of levy of FBT
> which is available in Circular no: 8/2015. The relevant portions of the
> circular are quoted as under. The objective is as follows:
> "2. Objective:
> 2.1 The taxation of perquisites or fringe benefits is justified both on
> grounds of equity and economic efficiency. When fringe benefits are under-
> taxed, it violates both horizontal and vertical equity. A taxpayer receiving
> his entire income in cash bears a higher tax burden in comparison to another
> taxpayer who receives his income partly in cash and partly in kind, thereby
> violating horizontal equity. Further, fringe benefits are generally provided
> to senior executives in the organization. Therefore, under-taxation of
> fringe benefits also violates vertical equity. It also discriminates between
> companies which can provide fringe benefits and those which cannot thereby
> adversely affecting market structure. However, the taxation of fringe
> benefits raises some problems primarily because-
> (a) all benefits cannot be individually attributed to employees,
> particularly in cases where the benefit is collectively enjoyed;
26
> ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd., Hyd.
(b) of the present widespread practice of providing p erquisites, wherein many
perquisites are disguised as reimbursements or other miscellaneous expenses so
as to enable the employees to escape/reduce their tax liability; and
(c) of the difficulty in the valuation of the benefits.
2.2 In India, prior to assessment year 1998-99, some perquisites/fringe
benefits were included in salary in terms of section 17 and accordingly taxed
under section 15 of the Income-tax Act in the hands of the employee and a
large number of fringe benefits were taxed by the emplo yer-based disallowance
method where the quantum of the disallowance was estimated on a presumptive
basis. In practice, taxation of fringe benefits by the employer -based
disallowance method resulted in large-scale litigation on account of ambiguity
in defining the tax base. Therefore, the taxation of fringe benefits by the
employer-based disallowance method was withdrawn by the Finance Act, 1997.
However, the withdrawal of the provisions relating to taxation of fringe
benefits by the employer-based disallowance method resulted in significant
erosion of the tax base. The Finance Act, 2005 has introduced a new levy,
namely, the FBT as a surrogate tax on employer, with the objective of
resolving the problems enumerated in para 2.1 above, expanding the tax base
and maintaining equity between employers".
4\. From the above, it can be seen that as employee based taxation is
difficult and also from the considerations of equity, the tax on benefits
received by employees is charged from the employer. FBT is a tax on
expenditure of the employer and not on his income. The fact that FBT is part
of expenditure in commercial parlance is evident from answer to Query no: 103
of the circular cited above. The same is reproduced hereunder:
"Whether FBT would be allowable deduction while computing 'book profit' under
section 115JB?
103\. FBT is a liability qua employer. It is an expenditure laid out or
expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession
of the employer. However, sub -clause (ic) of clause (a) of section 40 of the
Income -tax Act expressly prohibits the deduction of the amount of FBT paid,
for the purposes of computing the income under the head 'profits and gains of
business or profession'. This prohibition does not apply to the computation of
'book profit' for the purposes of sect ion 11SJ8. Accordingly, the FBT is an
allowable deduction in the  27 ITA No. 2010/Hyd/17 Wissen Infotech Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyd.
computation of 'book profit' under section 11SlB of the Income - tax Act".
From the above, it may kindly be seen that FBT is an expenditure in commercial
parlance and needs to be considered as part of operating expenses. "
16.3 Considered the rival submissions and perused the material on record. The
assessee made the plea before us that TPO has considered the FBT as operating
expenses at the same time, he eliminated the FBT expenditure in the case of
comparables. AR has not submitted any papers in support of such submission.
However, as a principle, the profit margin should be compared with comparables
by following similar set of rules and accounting principles. In case of
following different methods/rules, we end up reaching different conclusions.
Therefore, we remit this issue also to the file of AO/TPO to treat the FBT as
business operating expenses for both the assessee as well as comparables to
determine the margin and then compare the same for arriving proper ALP.
Accordingly, additional ground raised by the assessee is allowed for
statistical purposes.
17\. In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for statistical
purposes.
