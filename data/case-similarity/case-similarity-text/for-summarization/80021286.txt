under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution are totally distinguishable and
to operate differently and distinctly in different situation, we are of the
view that the learned single Judge has committed an error by allowing the
draft amendment.
22\. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that Letters Patent Appeal
No. 26 of 2017 deserves to be allowed and accordingly, it is allowed by
setting aside the order dated 26th August, 2016 passed by the learned single
Judge in Special Civil Application No. 15647 of 2015. As the main Letters
Patent Appeal No. 26 of 2017 is allowed, Civil Application No. 733 of 2017
does not survive and the same is disposed of.
23\. Consequently, Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 23 of 2017 to 25 of 2017 are
also allowed by setting aside the order dated 26th August, 2016 passed by the
learned single Judge in Special Civil Application Nos. 15649, 15650 and 15651
of 2015. Since the Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 23 of 2017 to 25 of 2017 are
allowed, connected civil applications filed therein do not survive and the
same are disposed of. No order as to costs.

JUSTICE MR. R.SUBHASH REDDY)
1\. All these Letters Patent Appeals under Clause-15 of the Letters Patent are
filed by the original respondent in a group of Special Civil Applications,
aggrieved by the common C.A.V. order dated 26th August, 2016, passed by
learned single Judge, and therefore, they are heard together and disposed of
by this  Page 2 of 28 HC-NIC Page 2 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST
2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT common judgment.
2\. For the purpose of disposal, we refer to the facts and parties arrayed in
Special Civil Application No. 15647 of 2015 in which Letters Patent Appeal No.
26 of 2017 is filed.
3\. By the aforesaid common order, the learned single Judge allowed draft
amendments in each of the petitions and aggrieved by such order, these appeals
are filed. As such, we confine to state the facts which are necessary for
disposal of these appeals.
4\. The facts, in brief, giving rise to filing of these appeals, are that, the
appellant herein, entered into ship building contract with the respondent no.1
herein on 6th December, 2006. By the aforesaid contract, the appellant agreed
to design, build, launch, equip, outfit, test and complete one 74,600 DWT
Panamax Bulk Carrier (Hull No. P011) and the respondent no.1 has agreed to
purchase and accept the delivery thereof. The appellant, under the contract,
has furnished refund bank guarantee against the payment made in terms of
advances on signing the contract. The respondent no.1-company, on the ground
that there was delay in delivering the ship and thus, terms of the contract
were violated, cancelled and terminated the contract on 10th December, 2011.
In view of the termination of the contract, the appellant herein was left with
no option but to invoke arbitration as per the contract. Accordingly,
arbitration proceedings were commenced between the present  Page 3 of 28 HC-
NIC Page 3 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV
JUDGMENT appellant and respondent no.1-company herein at Singapore as per the
Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules, being SIAC Arbitration No.
175 of 2011. In the arbitration proceedings, the 1st partial award was passed
on 20th December, 2012, 2nd partial award was passed on 24th September 2013
and final award was passed on 5th May, 2014.
4.1. The appellant herein challenged the arbitral award dated 24th September,
2013, passed in arbitration proceedings, by way of application under Section
34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 ("the Act" for short) before
the 2nd Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula. Along with the
application under Section 34 of the Act, the appellant also filed an
application vide exh. 6, seeking stay of operation, implementation, execution
and/or enforcement of the arbitral award till the final disposal of the
application under Section 34 of the Act. The learned 2nd Additional District
Judge, Amreli, vide order dated 25th October, 2013, returned the application
which was filed under Section 34 of the Act, under Order VII of Rule 10 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\. The said order was challenged by the present
appellant before this Court by way of Appeal From Order No. 462 of 2013 and
the learned single Judge of this Court, while issuing notice in the said
Appeal From Order, granted status quo with regard to execution of the arbitral
award till final disposal of the appeal.
Page 4 of 28 HC-NIC Page 4 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017
C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT 4.2. It is the case of the appellant that in spite
of the fact that respondent no.1 was aware of the proceedings initiated before
the Indian court, respondent no.1 purposefully and in complete disrespect and
disregard to the Indian courts, has not appeared in the said proceedings and
ultimately, vide judgment dated 8th May, 2014, the Appeal From Order filed by
the appellant came to be allowed by the learned single Judge of this Court by
setting aside the order dated 25th October, 2013 passed by the learned
Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula. By the said order, it is held by
the learned single Judge of this Court that the learned Additional District
Judge, Amreli at Rajula has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the
application filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996.
4.3. It is the further case of the appellant that after the C.A.V judgment
dated 8th May, 2014 passed in the Appeal From Order, the learned Additional
District Judge, vide order dated 28th May, 2014 issued notice to the
respondent no.1 calling upon it to appear on 6th June, 2014 and to show cause
as to why reliefs as sought in the application filed under Section 34 of the
Act should not be granted. It appears that thereafter, the appellant sent the
complete set of application filed under Section 34 of the Act along with stay
application to respondent no.1, through courier service and proof of such
intimation was placed on record before the  Page 5 of 28 HC-NIC Page 5 of 28
Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT Additional
District Judge by way of affidavit of service dated 6th June, 2014. It is
stated that respondent no.1 has not chosen to appear before the Additional
District Judge and the learned Additional District Judge proceeded ex parte
and passed ad interim order dated 16th June, 2014, granting stay of operation,
implementation, execution and/or enforcement of the arbitral award. It is the
case of the appellant that even after issuance of notice, though respondent
no.1 was aware of the proceedings initiated before the Additional District
Judge, Amreli at Rajula, it has not deliberately appeared before the learned
Additional District Judge and thereafter, has indirectly enforced the arbitral
award under challenge by encashing the money secured under the refund bank
guarantees on 17th October, 2014, 20th October, 2014 and 22nd October, 2014.
It is the further case of the appellant that thereafter, in stead of filing
reply to the application filed by the present appellant under section 34 of
the Act, respondent no.1 filed an application vide exh. 19 (Application for
Dismissal) on 24th December, 2014 before the Additional District Judge, Amreli
at Rajula, raising the contention with regard to maintainability of the
application under Section 34 of the Act. The appellant herein filed its reply
vide exh. 23 to the application for dismissal on 27th February, 2015, mainly
highlighting the mala fide conduct of the respondent no.1 company. Apropos to
filing of the  Page 6 of 28 HC-NIC Page 6 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01
IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT application for dismissal by the
respondent, the appellant herein filed an application vide exh. 26 before the
Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula on 17th April, 2015, challenging
the maintainability of the application for dismissal filed by the respondent
no.1 company, mainly on the ground that the Act itself is a self-contained
code and the Act does not contain any provision for filing of the application
in the nature of application for dismissal. The respondent herein chose not to
file reply to the said application. Accordingly, the Additional District
Judge, Amreli at Rajula, after bipartite hearing, by a reasoned order dated
28th August, 2015, dismissed the application of respondent no.1 for dismissal
of the application filed by the appellant under section 34 of the Act, and
granted the application, exh. 26, filed by the appellant herein.
4.4. Challenging the said order dated 28th August, 2015, Special Civil
Application No. 15647 of 2015 was filed by the respondent-original petitioner
with the prayers which read as under:
> "28(a). that the Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari or a
> writ in the nature of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order or
> direction calling for records of the case and after going into the legality
> and validity thereof, direct the learned Civil Judge at Rajula, Amreli
> District, Gujarat, not to exercise its jurisdiction in the matter and to
> dismiss the application filed by the respondent under S.34 of the  Page 7 of
> 28 HC-NIC Page 7 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017
> C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996;
> (b) that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to set aside the order of the
> learned District Judge at Rajula, Amreli District dated 28 August 2015
> allowing the respondents application dated 17 April 2015 filed under Exh.26
> and rejecting the application challenging jurisdiction (Filed under Exh.19);
> (c) that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to set aside the interim order of
> the learned District Judge at Rajula, Amreli District staying the operation,
> implementation, execution and/or enforcement of the Award pending hearing
> and final disposal of the Original Application;
> (d) interim and ad-interim reliefs as terms of prayers Clause (a), (b) and
> (c);
> (e) for such further and other reliefs as the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
> proper in the nature and circumstances of the case."
4.5. In the aforesaid special civil application, which was filed under Article
227 of the Constitution of India, affidavit in reply was filed on behalf of
the appellant herein. After filing of the affidavit in reply on behalf of the
appellant, respondent no.1 herein has moved a draft amendment to add prayer
Clause-28(aa) after prayer clause 28(a) in the petition. The prayer which is
sought to be impleaded by way of amendment reads as under:
> "28(aa). This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a writ of prohibition
> and/or any other appropriate writ, order or direction restraining the
> learned District Judge, Amreli at Rajula from entertaining and/or
> adjudicating Misc. Civil Application No.16 of 2014 filed under Section  Page
> 8 of 28 HC-NIC Page 8 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017
> C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
> by the respondent herein and the learned District Judge, Amreli at Rajula
> may be directed to dispose of the said application as not maintainable."
4.6. When the said draft amendment was filed, the same was opposed by the
appellant herein, mainly on the ground that draft amendment which is allowed,
could enlarge the scope of the petition. It was the case of the appellant
before the learned single Judge that as the petition was filed in the capacity
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging the validity of the
order passed by the Civil Court on the maintainability of the petition, if any
prayer as sought for is allowed by introducing the prayer for issuance of writ
of prohibition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the same will
change the nature of the subject-matter in the proceedings between the
parties. It is also pleaded that there were delay and laches in seeking such
prayer by way of amendment. In spite of the same, the learned single Judge, by
overruling the objection of the appellant to the draft amendment, has allowed
the draft amendment permitting to carry out the amendment mainly on the ground
that, no ground existed to relegate the respondent no.1 company to the Civil
Court to decide its own jurisdiction when it has opposed the proceedings
initiated by the appellant under section 34 of the Act on the ground of  Page

Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.
5\. Heard Shri Tejas Karia, learned counsel assisted by Shri Nirag Pathak and
Ms Grishma Ahuja for Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas and Co., Advocate for the
appellant, Shri Rashesh Sanjanwala, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Shri
Hardik P Modh and Shri Amit Laddha, learned counsel for respondent no.1 and
Shri G.M. Joshi, learned counsel for respondent no.2.
6\. In these appeals, it is contended by Shri Karia, learned counsel appearing
on behalf of the appellant, that the learned single Judge has committed an
error in allowing the draft amendment, in spite of the fact that it would
result in the change of nature of the proceedings, being special civil
application. It is contended by the learned counsel that special civil
application was filed challenging the order dated 28th August, 2015 passed by
the learned Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula, whereby the
application filed by the appellant herein to reject the application filed by
the respondent no.1 for dismissal of application of the appellant filed under
Section 34 of the Act was allowed and the application of respondent no.1 was
rejected. It is submitted that initially, respondent no.1 has filed special
civil application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. But during
the course of hearing, draft amendment was filed to introduce the new prayer
for issuance of writ of prohibition. It is contended by the learned counsel
that the  Page 10 of 28 HC-NIC Page 10 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01
IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT learned single Judge has virtually
decided the merits of the matter in the impugned order itself and allowed the
petition contrary to the settled norms that no amendment can be allowed when
it changes the nature of a proceeding. It is further submitted that there were
abnormal delay and laches in seeking the amendment and in spite of the same,
such contention was not considered and the learned single Judge has allowed
the draft amendment. Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his
argument has relied on the following judgments:
(i) Thirumala Tirpuati Devasthanams and another vs. Thallappaka
Ananthacharyulu and others, reported in (2003) 8 Supreme Court Cases 134;
(ii) Radhey Shyam and another vs. Chhabi Nath and others, reported in (2015) 5
Supreme Court Cases 423;
(iii) Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji vs. State of Gujarat and others, reported in
(2015) 9 Supreme Court Cases 1;
(iv) Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited vs. Applied Electronics Limited,
reported in (2017) 2 Supreme Court Cases 37;
(v) judgment of learned single Judge of this Court rendered in Special Civil
Application No. 8009 of 2010 on 18.8.2010;
(vi) Venture Global Engineering vs. Satyam Computer Services Ltd and another,
reported in (2008) 4 Supreme Court  Page 11 of 28 HC-NIC Page 11 of 28 Created
On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT Cases 190.
7\. On the other hand, Shri R.S.Sanjanwala, learned Senior Advocate appearing
on behalf of respondent no.1, contended that there is no error committed by
the learned single Judge so as to challenge the said order by way of Letters
Patent Appeal. It is submitted that as per the terms of the contract entered
into between the parties, it was specifically agreed that the disputes between
the parties are to be resolved by way of arbitration as per the provisions
under Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules and as per the laws of
England, and therefore, the court of Additional District Judge at Amreli has
no jurisdiction either to entertain the application filed under Section 34 of
the Act or to pass interim order thereon. It is contended that the grounds
with regard to jurisdiction were already taken in the special civil
application, which is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
But at the same time, there was no specific prayer for writ of prohibition and
as such, the amendment sought is merely clarificatory in nature. It is
submitted that by virtue of allowing such draft amendment, no prejudice is
caused to the appellant herein and to avoid the multiplicity of proceedings,
the learned single Judge has rightly allowed the draft amendment. In support
of his contentions, the learned counsel has placed reliance on the following
judgments:

C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT

Supreme Court Cases 341;
(iii) Andhra Bank vs. ABN Amro Bank N.V. and others, reported in (2007) 6
Supreme court Cases 167.
8\. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the
order passed by the learned single Judge and other materials placed on the
record.
9\. Having regard to the contentions advanced by the learned counsel on both
sides, the only question that is required to be considered is, whether the
draft amendment granted by the learned single Judge would result in the change
in the nature of proceedings pending in the special civil application or not.
As the special civil application in which the draft amendment is granted, is
pending before the learned single Judge, it is not desirable to enter into the
merits of the matter, and therefore, we proceed to record our finding only for
the purpose of disposal of these appeals.
10\. From the materials placed on record, it is clear that there was an
agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent no.1 for ship
building on 6th December, 2006 and by the aforesaid contract, the appellant
agreed to design, build,  Page 13 of 28 HC-NIC Page 13 of 28 Created On Thu
Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT launch, equip, outfit,
test and complete one 74,600 DWT Panamax Bulk Carrier (Hull No. P011) and the
respondent companies agreed to purchase and accept the delivery thereof. It is
the case of the respondent no.1 that the contract was not executed within the
time as agreed upon and there was breach of terms of contract, resultantly,
the respondent no.1 terminated the contract and is entitled to invoke the bank
guarantees which were furnished by the appellant. On the other hand, it is the
case of the appellant that circumstances were beyond the control of the
appellant and the delay occurred on account of vis major, and therefore, there
was no breach of terms of contract. When the award was passed by Singapore
International Arbitration Centre, the said award was sought to be challenged
by the appellant by way of an application under the provisions of Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 before the learned Additional
District Judge, Amreli at Rajula. In the said application, it was the case of
the appellant that though there was knowledge about initiation of proceedings,
respondent no.1 has purposely and deliberately avoided to appear before the
learned Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula and the learned Additional
District Judge, Amreli at Rajula, after hearing the appellant herein, has
passed order of status quo granting injunction by restraining respondent no.1
from enforcing and executing the award under challenge. But the fact remains
that subsequently respondent  Page 14 of 28 HC-NIC Page 14 of 28 Created On
Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT no.1 has appeared
before the learned Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula and filed an
application seeking dismissal of the application filed by the appellant under
Section 34 of the Act, mainly on the ground that, the said court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the application in view of the contractual terms.
When such application was filed, the appellant herein also filed another
application to reject the application filed by respondent no.1 which
questioned the maintainability of the application filed by the appellant under
Section 34 of the Act. The learned Additional District Judge, Amreli at
Rajula, allowed the application of the appellant, which resulted in the
rejection of the application filed by respondent no.1, wherein respondent no.1
has questioned the maintainability of the application of the appellant under
Section 34 of the Act. Aggrieved by such order passed by the learned
Additional District Judge, Amreli at Rajula, respondent no.1 approached this
Court by filing special civil application with the reliefs which are quoted
hereinabove. At a belated stage, respondent no.1 has sought amendment by
introducing prayer for a writ of prohibition under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India, mainly on the ground that, the learned Additional
District Judge, Amreli at Rajula has no jurisdiction to adjudicate and proceed
with the matter.
11\. For the reasons we propose to record hereafter, we are of the view that,
by allowing the draft amendment filed by  Page 15 of 28 HC-NIC Page 15 of 28
Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT respondent
no.1 in the special civil application, it will change the nature of the
proceedings. The application which is initially filed is amenable to
correction only in view of the power of superintendence conferred on this
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is also fairly well
settled that jurisdiction vested in the High Court under Article 227 of the
Constitution is revisional jurisdiction and no Letters Patent Appeal lies
against such order passed by learned single Judge in exercise of such power.
The power conferred under Article 226 of the Constitution on this Court is
original jurisdiction and therefore, this Court is empowered to issue orders,
directions or writs which are in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,
prohibition, quo-warranto, certiorari, etc. So far as the writ of prohibition
is concerned, the High Courts are empowered to issue writs, including a writ
in the nature of prohibition. A writ of prohibition is normally issued only
when the inferior Court or Tribunal proceeds to act without or in excess of
jurisdiction, in violation of rules of natural justice or under the law which
is itself ultra vires or unconstitutional, or in contravention of fundamental
rights. It is also equally well settled that writs of prohibition are to be
issued in the rarest of rare cases and such jurisdiction is original
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Where the order
of a civil court is challenged by way of a proceeding, no amendment can be
allowed therein by introducing the prayer for a writ of  Page 16 of 28 HC-NIC

JUDGMENT prohibition which is normally to be issued in exercise of power under
Article 226 of the Constitution. When such amendment is allowed, definitely,
it changes the nature of proceedings from revisional jurisdiction to original
jurisdiction. Whereas the order under challenge in the special civil
application is to be tested under the revisional jurisdiction under Article
227 of the Constitution of India, the amendment which introduces the prayer
for issuance of a writ of prohibition, can be considered only in exercise of
power conferred under original jurisdiction of this Court in exercise of power
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
12\. In the judgment relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant in the
case of Thirumala Tirpuati Devasthanams and another vs. Thallappaka
Ananthacharyulu and others, reported in (2003) 8 Supreme Court Cases 134, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the scope for issuance of a writ of
prohibition and has held that the Supreme Court and the High Courts have power
to issue writs, including a writ of prohibition. It is further held that a
writ of prohibition is normally issued only when the inferior court or
tribunal proceeds to act without or in excess of jurisdiction, in
contravention of the rules of natural justice and in contravention of
fundamental rights. It is also held that a writ of prohibition must be issued
only in the rarest of rare cases and judicial discipline of the highest order
has to be exercised while  Page 17 of 28 HC-NIC Page 17 of 28 Created On Thu

specifically observed that writ jurisdiction is original jurisdiction distinct
from appellate jurisdiction. In clear terms, it is held that an appeal cannot
be allowed to be disguised in the form of a writ. In para-14 of the aforesaid
judgment, Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held as under:-
> "14. On the basis of the authorities it is clear that the Supreme Court and
> the High Courts have power to issue writs, including a writ of prohibition.
> A writ of prohibition is normally issued only when the inferior Court or

13\. In the case of Radhey Shyam and another vs. Chhabi Nath and others,
reported in (2015) 5 Supreme Court Cases 423, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
examined the scope and distinction between Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has held that all the courts in the jurisdiction of a High Court are
subordinate to it and subject to its control and supervision under Article 227
of the Constitution of India. It is specifically held that judicial orders of
civil courts are not amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, and challenge to such judicial orders would lie by way
of revision or under Article 227 of the Constitution, but not by way of a writ
under Articles 226 or 32 of the Constitution of India. While answering the
reference in the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in
Page 19 of 28 HC-NIC Page 19 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017
C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT paras 27 to 29.3 as under:
> "27. Thus, we are of the view that judicial orders of civil courts are not

> with the view of the referring Bench that a writ of mandamus does not lie

> Contrary view in Surya Dev Rai is overruled."
14\. Learned counsel for the appellant has also placed reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jogendrasinhji
Vijaysinghji vs. State of Gujarat and others, reported in (2015) 9 Supreme
Court Cases 1. In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
summarized the principles on the maintainability of Letters  Page 20 of 28 HC-
NIC Page 20 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV
JUDGMENT Patent Appeals under Clause-15 of the Letters Patent of the High
Court, against the order passed by the learned single Judges. While
considering the various issues elaborately, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
in the aforesaid judgment that the orders passed by the civil court are only
to be scrutinised by the High Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article
227 of the Constitution, which is different from Article 226 of the
Constitution. In the aforesaid judgment, the view taken by the High Court in
the case of Radhey Shyam (supra) is approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The
conclusions of the judgments are summarized in paras 45 and 46, which are
quoted as under:
> "45. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we proceed to summarise our
> conclusions as follows:-
> 45.1. Whether a letters patent appeal would lie against the order passed by
> the learned Single Judge that has travelled to him from the other tribunals
> or authorities, would depend upon many a facet. The Court fee payable on a
> petition to make it under Article 226 or Article 227 or both, would depend
> upon the rules framed by the High Court.
> 45.2. The order passed by the civil court is only amenable to be scrutinized
> by the High Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227 of the

CAV JUDGMENT 45.4. Tribunal being or not being party in a writ petition is not
determinative of the maintainability of a letters patent appeal."
15\. Further reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited vs Applied Electronics
Limited, reported in (2017) 2 Supreme Court Cases 37. In the aforesaid
judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has examined the applicability of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 to arbitration proceedings under the provisions of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the
aforesaid judgment has disagreed with the earlier view taken in the case of
ITI Ltd. Vs Siemens Public Communications Network Ltd, reported in (2002) 5
SCC 510 and has referred the matter to the larger Bench. Paras 27 and 28 of
the aforesaid judgment read as under:
> "27. Section 5 which commences with a non-obstante clause clearly stipulates
> that no judicial authority shall interfere except where so provided in Part
> 1 of the 1996 Act. As we perceive, the 1996 Act is a complete Code and
> Section 5 in categorical terms along with other provisions, lead to a
> definite conclusion that no other provision can be attracted. Thus, the
> application of CPC is not conceived of and, therefore, as a natural
> corollary, the cross-objection cannot be entertained. Though we express our
> view in the present manner, the judgment rendered in ITI Ltd. (supra) is a
> binding precedent. The three-Judge Bench decision in International Security
> & Intelligence Agency Ltd. (supra) can be distinguished as that is under the
> 1940 Act which has Section 41 which clearly states that the procedure of CPC
> would be applicable to appeals. The analysis made in ITI Ltd.
Page 22 of 28
HC-NIC Page 22 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017
CAV JUDGMENT (supra) to the effect that merely because the 1996 Act does not
provide CPC to be applicable, it should not be inferred that the Code is
inapplicable seems to be incorrect, for the scheme of the 1996 Act clearly
envisages otherwise and the legislative intendment also so postulates.
28\. As we are unable to follow the view expressed in ITI Ltd.(supra) and we
are of the considered opinion that the said decision deserves to be re-
considered by a larger Bench. Let the papers be placed before the Hon'ble the
Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate larger Bench."
16\. Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his argument
that foreign award passed in international commercial arbitration outside
India can be challenged by way of a petition under Section 34 of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, placed reliance on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Venture Global Engineering vs. Satyam
Computer Services Ltd and another, reported in (2008) 4 Supreme Court Cases
190. The said judgment is not relevant for the purpose of disposal of these
appeals as the matter before this Court is not with regard to such
maintainability as in the said judgment. However, the judgment relied on by
the leaned counsel for the appellant in the case of Radhey Shyam (supra) and
the judgment in the case of Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji (supra) would render
assistance to the appellant in support of the plea of the appellant that by
allowing the amendment, the nature of proceedings pending in the special civil
application would  Page 23 of 28 HC-NIC Page 23 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30
00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT change. In the aforesaid
judgments, in clear terms, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the orders
passed by subordinate courts are subject to challenge only in a proceeding
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and no challenge to such
judicial orders could lie by way of a writ petition under Articles 226 and 32
of the Constitution of India. The aforesaid view taken in the judgments
referred above, fortifies the stand of the appellant that, if amendment is
allowed, certainly, it would alter or change the nature of the proceedings.
17\. Learned Senior Advocate Shri R.S. Sanjanwala, appearing on behalf of
respondent no.1 has placed reliance on the judgment of the learned single
Judge of Allahabad High Court in the case of Arun Lata v. Civil Judge,
Bulandshahar and others, reported in 1997 SCC Online All 367. In the said
case, petition was filed only under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
and amendment was sought by adding the words, "petition under Articles 226/227
of the Constitution of India". By the aforesaid judgment, without dealing with
the petition with regard to the proposed amendment, the learned single Judge
allowed such amendment by observing that such question can be gone into at a
later stage.
18\. Learned counsel for respondent no.1 has also placed reliance upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Rehman and another
v. Mohd. Ruldu and others, reported in (2012) 11 Supreme Court Cases  Page 24
of 28 HC-NIC Page 24 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017
C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT 341, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
considered the scope of provision of Order-VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and the proviso which was added by the CPC Amendment Act 22 of 2002,
and held that the courts should try merits of the case that comes before them
and should, consequently, allow all amendments that may be necessary for
determining the real question in controversy between the parties, provided it
does not cause injustice or prejudice to the other side. In the aforesaid
judgment, it is clearly held that when the nature of proceeding is not
changed, such amendments are to be allowed.
19\. Further reliance is placed by the learned counsel for respondent no.1 on
the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Andhra Bank vs. ABN
Amro Bank N.V. and others, reported in (2007) 6 Supreme court Cases 167,
wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the relevant considerations
at the stage of considering the application for amendment filed under Order VI
Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In the aforesaid judgment, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the court cannot go into the question of merit
of such amendment and it can only consider whether such amendment would be
necessary for the decision of the real controversy between the parties
concerned.
20\. The judgments relied on by the learned counsel for respondent no.1 are of
no assistance in support of the plea of  Page 25 of 28 HC-NIC Page 25 of 28
Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017 CAV JUDGMENT respondent
no.1 having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case. It is
fairly well settled that all the amendments which are necessary for
determination of the issue in controversy are to be liberally allowed. But at
the same time, it is consistently held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that when
amendment in the petition results in the change of nature of the proceedings,
such amendment cannot be allowed. The judgments relied on by the learned
counsel for the appellant support the case of the appellant in this case.
21\. Applying the ratio of the judgments referred above and further looking at
the order passed by the learned single Judge, we are of the view that while
considering the prayer for amendment, the learned single Judge has gone into
the merits of the matter by relying on the clauses contained in the agreement.
The learned single Judge has recorded a finding that arbitration was held in
Singapore under the Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Centre and
the parties to the proceedings participated in the said arbitral proceedings
without any demur or protest, and thus, by agreement, excluded the
applicability of all provisions of Part-I of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996. In view of the above, we are of the view that the learned single
Judge has committed an error by placing reliance on such finding while
considering the prayer for amendment of the pleading. Having regard to the
fact that for determination of the real issue and controversy  Page 26 of 28
HC-NIC Page 26 of 28 Created On Thu Mar 30 00:12:01 IST 2017  C/LPA/23/2017
CAV JUDGMENT which arose for consideration in the special civil application,
we are of the view that the prayer which is sought to be introduced by way of
amendment is not necessary. Further, having regard to the judgments relied on
by the learned counsel for the appellant and the fact that the scope of powers
under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution are totally distinguishable and
to operate differently and distinctly in different situation, we are of the
view that the learned single Judge has committed an error by allowing the
draft amendment.
22\. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that Letters Patent Appeal
No. 26 of 2017 deserves to be allowed and accordingly, it is allowed by
setting aside the order dated 26th August, 2016 passed by the learned single
Judge in Special Civil Application No. 15647 of 2015. As the main Letters
Patent Appeal No. 26 of 2017 is allowed, Civil Application No. 733 of 2017
does not survive and the same is disposed of.
23\. Consequently, Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 23 of 2017 to 25 of 2017 are
also allowed by setting aside the order dated 26th August, 2016 passed by the
learned single Judge in Special Civil Application Nos. 15649, 15650 and 15651
of 2015. Since the Letters Patent Appeal Nos. 23 of 2017 to 25 of 2017 are
allowed, connected civil applications filed therein do not survive and the
same are disposed of. No order as to costs.
