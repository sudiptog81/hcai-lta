rejected. Having participated in the examination and taken the chance, the
candidate cannot be allowed to object to the date of examination or submit
that the examination should have been postponed. The said plea is unacceptable
and would set at naught the entire examination process. It was open to the
candidates, who had filed Civil Appeal No. 4794/2012, before the Supreme Court
to raise the said plea. We may only note here that list of 205 candidates
dated 30 th May, 2012 WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 16 of 17 was
circulated pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court in the judgment dated
28th May, 2012. By that time, the date of written examination in June, 2012
had already been notified and this was known to all candidates, including the
petitioners. Similar contentions were raised in WP(C) No. 3667/2012 Vivek
Tomar v. the Registrar General, High Court of Delhi and WP(C) 3668/2012
Archana Aggarwal v. the Registrar General High Court of Delhi, but were
rejected vide order dated 6th June, 2012, recording that the Supreme Court
while passing the order dated 28th May, 2012, did not consider it necessary to
extend the date for conducting the examination.

Aforementioned two writ petitions question the results of Delhi Judicial
Services Mains Examination, 2012. Interviews for selection are to commence on
28th January, 2013 and there being urgency, we have heard the arguments and
proceeded to deliver our judgment, as any delay would have caused prejudice to
the petitioners and an interim order that WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 1
of 17 the two petitioners and others similarly situated should be called for
interview would have created its own complications or a stay order would have
upset the entire schedule causing prejudice to others. In these circumstances
we have dispensed with the requirement of counter affidavit and the
respondents have been permitted to rely upon data/figures furnished in a form
of a chart.
2\. Rajesh Kumar Verma, who argued the writ petition in person, has submitted
that he had secured qualifying marks in three papers viz. General Knowledge
and Language (115 out of 250), Criminal Law (104 out of 200) and Civil Law-II
(103.5 out of 200), but could not qualify Civil Law-I in which he was awarded
53 marks out of 200. Rajesh Kumar Verma moved an application, under the Right
to Information Act, 2005, for inspection of the answer script. On inspection
he came to know that in Question No.1 of Part-A, Civil Law - I paper, he was
awarded „0‟ (zero) out of 25 marks.
3\. The contention of Rajesh Kumar Verma is that the evaluation of Part-A of
Civil Law-I paper, in which he scored low marks, was done arbitrarily since
there were no guidelines, scheme of valuation or model answers. Further, there
was no system of supervision or review of assessment i.e. marks awarded by the
examiner. This, according to him, has resulted in violation of Article 14 of
the Constitution as he has been denied right to fair evaluation, appearance
before the interview panel and possible selection. Reliance is placed on the
instructions, in the examination paper of Civil Law-I, to the effect that
"Even if you do not know the answer, you may attempt the questions as the test
is not only of knowledge of law but of the candidate‟s analytical skill also."
In support of his contentions, Rajesh Kumar Verma has relied upon decisions of
the Supreme Court in Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Ors.
WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 2 of 17
v. State of U.P. and Ors. (1991) 1 SCC 212; Y. Srinivasa Rao v. J. Veeraiah
and Ors. (1992) 3 SCC 63; The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v.
Shaunak H. Satya and Ors. (2011) 8 SCC 781 and decision of Kerala High Court
in Dr. B.K. Madhumohan and Anr. v. State of Kerala and Ors. 2000 KLJ 911.
Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in Sunil
Kumar Sharma and Ors. v. University of Bombay and Anr. 1987 MhLJ 124, to
contend that there is difference between re-evaluation of examination paper,
which may not be permissible unless there is a rule or policy to the said
effect, and cases where the examiner or the examination results itself are
faulty because the examiner has not followed certain basic parameters or
standard of assessment. He has contended that his case falls into the latter
category.
4\. On the other hand, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for Bhupender Pal
Sharma, has impelled that it is open to the court to direct re-evaluation or
rechecking of answer-sheets when the rules, policy or terms of examination are
silent. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of this Court in Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 2636/2012 titled Salil Maheshwari v. High Court of Delhi,
through Registrar General, decided on 4th May, 2012.
5\. It was accentuated that the candidate in question, Bhupender Pal Sharma,
had secured 79 marks out of 200 marks in Civil Law-I and, therefore, because
of one mark, has failed to qualify for the interview, in spite of securing
requisite marks in other written papers. It is submitted that the said
candidate has been awarded „0‟ (zero) mark in Question No. 4(b), out of 12.5
marks allocated to the said question.
WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 3 of 17
6\. Another submission made is that 205 candidates, who were declared as
qualified in 2nd/3rd list, published on 30th May, 2012, have been
discriminated against because they were asked to appear in the Main Subjective
Written Examination merely eight days thereafter, on 9th and 10th June, 2012.
Therefore, the other 346 candidates, whose names were published on 21st April,
2012, benefited by gaining longer time to prepare for the Main Subjective
Written Examination. The discrimination and lack of preparation time is
apparent, as it resulted in just 15 out of 215 candidates qualifying for the
interview, whereas 61 out of 346 candidates qualified for interview from the
earlier list.
7\. In the writ petition, filed by Bhupender Kumar Sharma, reliance has been
placed upon decision of Kerala High Court in B.K. Madhumohan (supra) and the
decision of Supreme Court in Y. Srinivasa Rao (supra) and Sanchit Bansal &
Anr. v. Joint Admission Board & Ors. in Civil Appeal No. 8520/2011 (AIR 2012
SC 214) and Sanjay Singh & Anr. v. U.P. Public Service Commission, Allahabad &
Anr. (2007) 3 SCC 720.
8\. In order to decide the above contentions, certain basic facts may be
noticed. Recruitment of judicial officers to Delhi Judicial Service is held as
per the procedure, criteria and qualifications prescribed under the Delhi
Judicial Service Rule, 1970. The said rules (See Appendix to the Rules)
prescribe a three stages process. In the first stage, the eligible candidates
appear in the objective type multiple choice examination and, on the basis of
their scores, qualify to appear in the Delhi Judicial Service Mains Written
Examination. This written examination is subjective with long answers and
consists of four distinct papers, General Knowledge & language, Civil Law-I,
Civil Law-II and Criminal Law. General candidates who secure 50% marks in
aggregate and 40% WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 4 of 17 marks in each
paper and 45% marks in aggregate and 35% marks in each paper, if he/she
belongs to the reserved category, qualify for the interview.
9\. The Civil Law-I paper, in the present case, consisted of two parts
„Part-A‟ and „Part-B‟. The cumulative marks, obtained in both the parts, have
been taken into consideration for deciding whether the minimum criteria, as
mentioned in the rules, are satisfied by the candidate.
10\. Writ petition, filed by Rajesh Kumar Verma, was listed before another
Bench and transferred to be listed before this Bench on 16th January, 2013. On
the said date, the respondents entered appearance, on advance notice, and
their counsel was directed to place on record details which were relevant and
material, in form of data. It was also directed, that to the extent permitted
and permissible in law, the said details or data shall be furnished to the
petitioner.
11\. The respondents on the next date i.e. 21st January, 2013, placed before
us, a chart setting out data required in order to decide the controversy
before us. For the sake of completeness, we are producing the entire chart:-

came up for hearing before us on 22nd January, 2013.
WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 6 of 17
12\. In addition to the said data, the respondents have filed a detailed chart
with the name of the candidates, their category and the marks awarded to each
question in Civil Law-I paper, for all candidates who appeared in the Delhi
Judicial Service Main Written Examination, held on June, 2012. To maintain
secrecy and confidentiality, this data was not provided to the two
petitioners. However, the chart, filed in support of the data/figures quoted
above, validates the data quoted above. The said chart will be kept on record
in a sealed cover by the Registrar General.
13\. At this stage, we would first like to deal with the contention raised by
the petitioner Bhupender Pal Sharma that re-evaluation and rechecking of the
question 4(b), in which the said petitioner had secured „0‟ zero marks out of
12.5 marks, should be permitted. It is an accepted and admitted position that
the rules and the terms, on which the examination was held, are silent
regarding re-evaluation. The petitioner propels that silence does not amount
to a negative command and, therefore, does not bar or prohibit re-evaluation.
We reject the said contention. The issue in question is not res integra and
has been settled by the Supreme Court in several decisions. In Maharashtra
State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education & Anr. v. Paritosh
Bhupesh Kurmarsheth and others. AIR 1984 SC 1543, the Supreme Court has held
that direction for re-evaluation cannot be issued when there is no provision
or absence of provision for re-evaluation. In other words, there must be a
specific provision for re-evaluation on merits before it can be directed. The
Supreme Court further held that a policy decision or provisions in rules that
no re-checking, verification or re-evaluation will be permitted, cannot be
challenged on the ground of arbitrariness or violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution, unless it can WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 7 of 17 be
shown that the policy itself was in violation of some statutory provision. It
was observed:-
> "......It is exclusively within the province of the legislature and its
> delegate to determine, as a matter of policy, how the provisions of the
> Statute can best be implemented and what measures, substantive as well as
> procedural would have to be incorporated in the rules or regulations for the
> efficacious achievement of the objects and purposes of the Act. .........
> .......The Court cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of the policy
> evolved by the legislature and the subordinate regulation-making body. It
> may be a wise policy which will fully effectuate the purpose of the
> enactment or it may be lacking in effectiveness and hence calling for
> revision and improvement. But any drawbacks in the policy incorporated in a
> rule or regulation will not render it ultra vires and the Court cannot
> strike it down on the ground that, in its opinion, it is not a wise or
> prudent policy, but is even a foolish one, and that it will not really serve
> to effectuate the purposes of the Act...."
14\. A more categorical exposition on the said principle is elucidated in
Pramod Kumar Srivastava v. Chairman, Bihar Public Service Commission, Patna &
Ors. AIR 2004 SC 4116:-
> "7. ....... Under the relevant rules of the Commission, there is no
> provision wherein a candidate may be entitled to ask for re-evolution of his
> answer-book. There is a provision for scrutiny only wherein the answer-books
> are seen for the purpose of checking whether all the answers given by a
> candidate have been examined and whether there has been any mistake in the
> totaling of marks of each question and noting them correctly on the first
> cover page of the answer-book. There is no dispute that after scrutiny no
> mistake was found in the marks awarded to the appellant in the General
> Science paper. In the absence of any provision for re-evaluation of answer-
> books in the relevant rules, no candidate in an examination has got any
> right whatsoever to claim or ask for re-evaluation of his marks."
15\. A similar view has been taken Dr. Muneeb Ul Rehman Haroon & Ors. v.
Government of Jammu and Kashmir State & Ors. AIR 1984 SC 1585; Board of
Secondary Education v. Pravas Ranjan Panda & WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013
Page 8 of 17 Anr. (2004) 13 SCC 383; President, Board of Secondary Education,
Orissa & Anr. v. D. Suvankar & Anr. (2007) 1 SCC 603; The Secretary, West
Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education v. Ayan Das & Ors. AIR 2007 SC
3098; and Sahiti & Ors. v. Chancellor, Dr. N.T.R. University of Health
Sciences & Ors. (2009) 1 SCC 599.
16\. Referring to the aforesaid decisions, the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal
Nos. 907/2006 and 897/2006 titled H.P. Public Service Commission v. Mukesh
Thakur & Anr. decided on 25th May, 2010, set aside the judgment and order of
High Court and allowed the appeals observing that in the absence of any
provision under the Statute or Statutory Rules/Regulations, the court should
not generally direct re- evaluation.
17\. The decision of this Court in the case of Salil Maheshwari (supra) and
Gunjan Sinha Jain v. High Court of Delhi through Registrar General, WP (Civil)
No. 449/2012, another connected matter decided on 9th April, 2012, are clearly
distinguishable and are not contrary to the principle or ratio stated above.
Judgment in Salil Maheshwari's case (supra) simply refers to the decision in
Gunjan Sinha Jain's case (supra). In Gunjan Sinha Jain's case, a Division
Bench of this Court noticed defects in some of the objective questions and the
suggested correct answers. The answers had to be marked by pencil for the
purpose of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR). It was, in these circumstances that
certain directions were issued in paragraphs 75, 76 and 77 of the judgment,
after noticing that the rules stipulated that minimum qualifying marks must be
secured and the number of candidates, to be admitted in the mains examination,
should not be more than 10 times the total number of vacancies advertised.
Accordingly, some directions were issued and the condition of permitting
appearing WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 9 of 17 candidates to be only 10
times the seats was diluted. This was a pragmatic solution to the problem
which had arisen. In Salil Maheshwari's case (supra), it was noticed that the
petitioner therein, on the basis of computation of marks, pursuant to decision
in Gunjan Sinha Jain's case (supra), had got 118.5 marks. However, the list of
top 230 candidates had ended at 122.5 marks and, therefore, the writ petition
of Salil Maheshwari was dismissed.
18\. We do not think that the judgment in the case of Gunjan Sinha Jain's case
(supra), postulates re-evaluation or re-examination of a single answer or the
entire paper. The said judgment was given in a peculiar situation, where some
questions were ambiguous and debatable, or multiple choices were incorrect or
the answers given in the answer sheet were incorrect. The situation was
entirely different. Similarly, in the case of Sunil Kumar Sharma's case
(supra), the Bombay High Court dealt with a peculiar factual matrix. 729
students had appeared and their papers in question were checked by 3 different
examiners. One examiner had checked and awarded marks to 22 candidates. He
failed the entire lot of 22 candidates whose papers were checked by him. They
were awarded marks between 4% to 19%. The High Court allowed the writ
observing that there was violation of two statutory paragraphs which
stipulated that the Chairman shall discuss the synoptic answers with his
examiners to ensure uniform standard in assessment and the Chairman/ Senior
Examiner had the right to review the assessment done by the examiner and could
issue instructions to the examiner to review or reassess the answer-sheet. The
examiner was to abide by the instructions. The statutory paragraphs were
important as they prevented discrimination when the answer papers were checked
by different examiners. Violation of the said paragraphs was the cornerstone
of the WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 10 of 17 said decision. In Sanchit
Bansal(supra) it has been observed that Court can interfere and direct re-
evaluation of the performance etc. where (i) there is violation of any
enactment, statutory Rules and Regulations; (ii) mala fides or ulterior
motives to assist or enable private gain to someone or cause prejudice to
anyone; or where the procedure adopted is arbitrary and capricious. The
procedure is arbitrary and capricious when it is illogical and whimsical,
something without any reasonable explanation.
19\. In the present case, the answer sheets of Part-A of Civil Law-I, have
been examined by one examiner and not by multiple or several examiners. The
said examiner has uniformly applied the same standard while checking the
answers of all the candidates. The chart quoted above shows that, out of 453
candidates, 265 candidates passed Civil Law-I paper and 188 candidates have
failed. Substantial number of candidates have cleared the paper and secured
good marks. In Part-A of the said paper, the maximum mark secured by a
candidate is 76% and the minimum marks secured is 7. In Part-B of the paper,
which was checked by a different examiner, maximum marks secured is 73% and
the minimum marks secured is 4%. Even in Part-B examination, several
candidates have secured „0‟ zero marks in respect of their answers. The number
of candidates securing „0‟ zero marks in Part-A paper may be more, but this
cannot be a ground to re-examine or re-evaluate the entire paper or even
specific answers. If we allow re-examination or re- evaluation of the answer
paper, in one case or even one question, the said exercise may have to be
completed across the board, in all cases where candidates have secured „0‟
zero or one, two or low marks. No particular candidate can be given
preference. Thus, if the plea of the petitioner is accepted, it will lead to
unpalatable and incongruous WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 11 of 17
situation which should be avoid. Rajesh Kumar Verma has secured 53 marks out
of 200 in Civil Law Paper 1 and he is short by 17 marks. The difference is
substantial in his case. In Bhupender Pal Sharma‟s case the difference may be
of only one mark but this by itself as noticed and elucidated below cannot be
a ground to direct re-evaluation or award grace marks. Given the intense
competition, it is not uncommon to come across cases where the difference
between a selected and unselected candidate is in fraction or less than one
mark.
20\. In matters of examination, especially competitive examination for
selection judicial interference should be exercised with care and grave
caution. Such kind of intrusion is rare. We do not think that present case
warrants interference and the valuation of marks award in the two
papers/answers are so glaring, absurd or demonstrably un-consciousable that
interference is called for. Answers papers of the two petitioners were in fact
shown to us. The present cases do not fall under the limited exceptions carved
out in Sanchit Bansal‟s Case (supra). Any interference will lead to gross and
indefinite uncertainty besides creating utter confusion. The position which
has been highlighted and explained by the Supreme Court in Maharashtra State
Board's case (supra).
21\. The contention of Bhupender Pal Sharma that he should be given one mark,
does not have any merit. We noticed that as per the chart, five candidates
have missed the qualifying mark by one and another five candidates by two
marks. There is no provision for giving bonus marks or additional marks to any
candidate. It will be improper and incorrect to give bonus mark or even
upgrade the marks. In Registrar, Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences,
Bangalore v. G. Hemlatha and Ors., (2012) 8 SCC 568 it was held:
WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 12 of 17
> "12. No provision of any statute or any rules framed thereunder have been
> shown to us, which permit rounding- off of eligibility criteria prescribed
> for the qualifying examination for admission to the PG course in MSc
> (Nursing). When the eligibility criteria is prescribed in a qualifying
> examination, it must be strictly adhered to. Any dilution or tampering with
> it will work injustice on other candidates. The Division Bench of the High
> Court erred in holding that the learned Single Judge was right in rounding-
> off of 54.71% to 55% so as to make Respondent 1 eligible for admission to
> the PG course. Such rounding- off is impermissible."
The said judgment also makes reference to an earlier decision in Orissa
Service Public Commission v. Rupashri Chaudhary, (2011) 8 SCC 108, that
neither grace marks nor rounding off is permissible unless there is a
permissible term under which the examinations were held. In the said case, the
candidate in question had secured qualifying marks in each individual paper
but in aggregate had 44.93% marks and not 45% marks as stipulated in the
rules. The difference was only 0.07% but the appeal filed was allowed by the
Supreme Court and the judgment of the High Court was set aside, observing that
rounding off or additional marks could not have been given.
22\. In Umesh Chand Shukla v. UOI, AIR 1985 SC 1351, Full Court resolution of
the High Court directing moderation by awarding 2 marks in each paper to all
candidates was adversely commented upon and the moderation done was struck
down. Exercise of power of moderation was likely to create a feeling of
discrimination in the process of selection and would violate principle of
equality and may lead to arbitrariness. There might be hard cases, but hard
cases cannot be allowed to make a bad law.
23\. In Rajinder Kumar Aggarwal v. High Court of Delhi and Anr., 1993 (25) DRJ
602, a Division Bench of this court examining the rules, has held that there
is no provision for reevaluation or moderation of WP(C) No. 207/2013 &
337/2013 Page 13 of 17 answer-sheets. In the said case, the petitioner therein
had secured one mark less for qualifying, in one of the papers, but had
obtained sufficient marks in other papers. The petitioner therein had made
reference to a Full Court Resolution. The said contention was rejected, after
referring to order dated 26th July, 1985 passed by the Supreme Court in an
application in Writ Petition No. 3805/1985 dated 26th July, 1985, which for
the sake of convenience is reproduced below:-
> "At the hearing of the above writ petition Mr. F.S. Nariman, learned counsel
> for Shri Rajan Sharma, one of the candidates selected for the Delhi Judicial
> Service Examination held in the year 1984, who has been imp leaded as a
> respondent in this case submits fairly and we think rightly that in the
> absence of an express rule for re- valuation it was not possible for the
> examining body to get one of the answer books of Shri Rajan Sharma revalued.
> In the absence of 18 marks which were added at the reevaluation, Shri Rajan
> Sharma would not have been eligible for the viva voce examination even
> though in some of the papers at the examination, he had done well. Shri
> Rajan Sharma, Therefore, withdraws his application for appointment to the
> Delhi Judicial Service. We appreciate the stand rightly taken by Shri Rajan
> Sharma in this Court. In view of the above we direct that the name of Shri
> Rajan Sharma would not be considered by the examining body for the purpose
> of appointment at the 1984 examination.
> sd/-
> E.S .Venkataramahia, J.
> R.B. Mishra, J.
> July 26, 1985."
The Division Bench rejected the contention that the petitioner had excellent
academic record and had secured First Division in LL.B. and that 1 (one) grace
mark should be given. Similar view has been taken in Vipin Sanduja v.
Registrar, Delhi High Court, 85 (2000) DLT 471.
24\. The contention that the absence of guidelines, moderation or model
answers results in arbitrary checking by the examiner has to be rejected as
unsustainable and meritless. The answer sheets relating to WP(C) No. 207/2013
& 337/2013 Page 14 of 17 Part-A were examined by one single examiner and not
by different examiners. The rules do not stipulate that there should be model
answers or mandatory guidelines, in writing, for assessment. The answer papers
have been checked by examiners who are proficient, well conversant and have
knowledge of the subjects. The examination, in question, is for appointment to
Delhi Judicial Service and is a competitive examination and not a college or
school examination. High standards are required and justified. The checking
and allotting of marks, for Part-A, may be strict, but this does not mean that
Court can interfere in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution. In matters of evaluation by experts and the standards which
should be adopted and applied, the courts cannot substitute or adorn the role
of the examiner. It cannot substitute its own opinion regarding what marks
could or should have been awarded, as the result. Interference is rare and
justified only when there is a blatant miscarriage of justice as set out in
Sanchit Bansal‟s case (supra). The following observations in H.P. Public
Service Commission (supra), are apposite:
> "19. In view of the above, it was not permissible for the High Court to
> examine the question paper and answer sheets itself, particularly, when the
> Commission had assessed the inter-se merit of the candidates. If there was a
> discrepancy in framing the question of evaluation of the answer, it could be
> for all the candidates appearing for the examination and not for respondent
> No. 1 only. It is a matter of chance that the High Court was examining the
> answer sheets relating to law. Had it been other subjects like physics,
> chemistry and mathematics, we are unable to understand as to whether such a
> course have been adopted by the High Court."
25\. In view of what we have stated above, we need not specifically deal with
the decisions relied upon by the petitioner Rajesh Kumar Verma, relating to
principle of arbitrariness, transparency etc. in the WP(C) No. 207/2013 &
337/2013 Page 15 of 17 cases of Shrilekha Vidyarthi (supra). In Y. Srinivasa
Rao's case (supra), a better candidate with the B.Com degree and longer
experience was ignored on the ground that the said aspects cannot be taken
into consideration for the purpose of comparison with the selected candidate
though they were relevant for the purpose of marks. Selection was by interview
and the allegation was that the interview was a farce. The Supreme Court while
allowing the appeal observed that in the absence of guidelines, the selection
was left to the whims of the individual officer holding the interview who had
unbridled powers. This is not so in the present case as there was a written
examination and marks have been awarded by examiners. The question papers and
answer papers are available. The decision in Dr. B.K. Madhumohan (supra), is
distinguishable for the reason, in the said case the question setters
themselves admitted that several questions should be deleted as there were no
correct choices in the answer booklet and the questions were controversial. It
is in this context, it was observed that capricious acts of examiners are not
immune from interference of the court. This was a case of blatant miscarriage
of justice.
26\. The contention raised by Bhupender Pal Sharma regarding lack of
preparation time and discrimination, as there were two separate lists and last
and second list came out eight days before the examination, has to be
rejected. Having participated in the examination and taken the chance, the
candidate cannot be allowed to object to the date of examination or submit
that the examination should have been postponed. The said plea is unacceptable
and would set at naught the entire examination process. It was open to the
candidates, who had filed Civil Appeal No. 4794/2012, before the Supreme Court
to raise the said plea. We may only note here that list of 205 candidates
dated 30 th May, 2012 WP(C) No. 207/2013 & 337/2013 Page 16 of 17 was
circulated pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court in the judgment dated
28th May, 2012. By that time, the date of written examination in June, 2012
had already been notified and this was known to all candidates, including the
petitioners. Similar contentions were raised in WP(C) No. 3667/2012 Vivek
Tomar v. the Registrar General, High Court of Delhi and WP(C) 3668/2012
Archana Aggarwal v. the Registrar General High Court of Delhi, but were
rejected vide order dated 6th June, 2012, recording that the Supreme Court
while passing the order dated 28th May, 2012, did not consider it necessary to
extend the date for conducting the examination.
27\. In view of the aforesaid position, the writ petitions are dismissed. No
Costs.

2\. Rajesh Kumar Verma, who argued the writ petition in person, has submitted
that he had secured qualifying marks in three papers viz. General Knowledge
and Language (115 out of 250), Criminal Law (104 out of 200) and Civil Law-II
(103.5 out of 200), but could not qualify Civil Law-I in which he was awarded
53 marks out of 200. Rajesh Kumar Verma moved an application, under the Right
to Information Act, 2005, for inspection of the answer script. On inspection
he came to know that in Question No.1 of Part-A, Civil Law - I paper, he was
awarded „0‟ (zero) out of 25 marks.

Civil Law-I paper, in which he scored low marks, was done arbitrarily since
rejected. Having participated in the examination and taken the chance, the
