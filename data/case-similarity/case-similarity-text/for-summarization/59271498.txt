                 which resulted in drastic reduction of agricultural lands. Agriculturists were
                 reduced to landless labourers. It was the grievance of the landless that there
                 were no proper schemes for rehabilitation of persons, who were deprived of
                 their land. Agriculturists were also aggrieved because their sole means of
                 livelihood was lost, as a result of the acquisition for purposes which were
                 admitted after a substantial lapse of time.
                              3. In the year 2003, National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation
                 was formulated and it was accepted that society should have a clear
                 perception of the reason behind land acquisition, and the benefits that will
                 flow from such acquisition. The adverse socio-economic and cultural impacts
                 resulting from acquisition of land were also to be examined. This policy was
                 replaced by the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy of 2007,
                 which also directed State Governments to acquire land, keeping in mind the
                 new rehabilitation policy.
                              4. Despite these policies, large scale acquisition by the State
                 Governments continued, and therefore the Parliament, thought it fit to bring
                 out a new Legislation to govern the law relating to Land Acquisition,by
                 enacting the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
                 Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, (hereinafter referred
                 to as the “New Act”). The statement of objects and reasons, which is self-

                                                                  6
                 explanatory and reads as under:
                                    "The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is the general law relating to
                              acquisition of land for public purpose and also for companies and for
                              determining the amount of compensation to be made on account of
                              such acquisition. The provisions of the said Act have been found to
                              be inadequate in addressing certain issues related to the exercise of
                              the statutory powers of the State for involuntary acquisition of
                              private land and property. The Act does not address the issues of
                              rehabilitation and resettlement to the affected persons and their
                              families.
                                    2. The definition of the expression "public purpose" as given in
                              the Act is very wide. It has, therefore, become necessary to re-
                              define it so as to restrict its scope for acquisition of land for strategic
                              purposes vital to the State, and for infrastructure projects where the
                              benefits accrue to the general public. The provisions of the Act are
                              also used for acquiring private lands for companies. This frequently
                              raises a question mark on the desirability of such State intervention
                              when land could be arranged by the company through private
                              negotiations on a "willing seller-willing buyer" basis, which could be
                              seen to be a more fair arrangement from the point of view of the
                              land owner. In order to streamline the provisions of the Act causing
                              less hardships to the owners of the land and other persons
                              dependent upon such land, it is proposed to repeal the Land
                              Acquisition Act, 1894 and to replace it with adequate provisions for
                              rehabilitation and resettlement for the affected persons and their
                              families.
                                    3. There have been multiple amendments to the Land
                              Acquisition Act, 1894 not only by the Central Government but by the
                              State Governments as well. Further, there has been heightened
                              public concern on land acquisition, especially multi-cropped irrigated
                              land and there is no central law to adequately deal with the issues of
    http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                                 7
                              rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced persons. As land
                              acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement need to be seen as
                              two sides of the same coin, a single integrated law to deal with the
                              issues of land acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement has
                              become necessary. Hence, the proposed legislation proposes to
                              address concerns of farmers and those whose livelihoods are
                              dependent on the land being acquired, while at the same time
                              facilitating land acquisition for industrialization, infrastructure and
                              urbanization projects in a timely and transparent manner.
                                    4. Earlier, the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007 and
                              Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2007 were introduced in the
                              Lok Sabha on 6th December, 2007 and were referred to the
                              Parliamentary   Standing Committee      on Rural Development for
                              Examination and Report. The Standing Committee presented its
                              reports (the 39th and 40th Reports) to the Lok Sabha on 21st
                              October, 2008 and laid the same in the Rajya Sabha on the same
                              day. Based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee and
                              as a consequence thereof, official amendments to the Bills were
                              proposed. The Bills, along with the official amendments, were
                              passed by the Lok Sabha on 25th February, 2009, but the same
                              lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha.
                                    5. It is now proposed to have a unified legislation dealing with
                              acquisition of land, provide for just and fair compensation and make
                              adequate provisions for rehabilitation and resettlement mecahnism
                              for the affected persons and their families. The Bill thus provides for
                              repealing and replacing the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 with broad
                              provisions for adequate rehabilitation and resettlement mecanism
                              for the project affected persons and their families.
                                    6. Provision of public facilities or infrastructure often requires
                              the exercise of powers by the State for acquisition of private
                              property leading to displacement of people, depriving them of their

                                                                    8
                              land, livelihood and shelter, restricting their access to traditional
                              resource   base    and    uprooting       them     from   the     socio-cultural
                              environment. These have traumatic, psychological and socio-cultural
                              consequences on the affected population which call for protecting
                              their rights, particularly in case of the weaker sections of the society
                              including members of the Scheduled Castes (SCs), the Scheduled
                              Tribes (STs), marginal farmers and their families.
                                    7. There is an imperative need to recognise rehabilitation and
                              resettlement    issues   as   intrinsic    to    the   development      process
                              formulated with the active participation of affected persons and
                              families. Additional benefits beyond monetary compensation have to
                              be   provided     to   families   affected       adversely   by     involuntary
                              displacement. The plight of those who do not have rights over the
                              land on which they are critically dependent for their subsistence is
                              even worse. This calls for a broader concerted effort on the part of
                              the planners to include in the displacement, rehabilitation and
                              resettlement process framework, not only for those who directly lose
                              their land and other assets but also for all those who are affected by
                              such acquisition. The displacement process often poses problems
                              that make it difficult for the affected persons to continue their
                              traditional livelihood activities after resettlement. This requires a
                              careful assessment of the economic disadvantages and the social
                              impact arising out of displacement. There must also be holistic effort
                              aimed at improving the all-round living standards of the affected
                              persons and families.
                                    8. A National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for
                              Project Affected Families was formulated in 2003, which came into
                              force with effect from February, 2004. Experience gained in
                              implementation of this policy indicates that there are many issues
                              addressed by the policy which need to be reviewed. There should be
                              a clear perception, through a careful quantification of the costs and
    http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                                  9
                              benefits that will accrue to society at large, of the desirability and
                              justifiability of each project. The adverse impact on affected
                              families-economic, environmental, social and cultural must be
                              assessed in participatory and transparent manner. A national
                              rehabilitation and resettlement framework thus needs to apply to all
                              projects where involuntary displacement takes place.
                                    9. The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007
                              has been formulated on these lines to replace the National Policy on
                              Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Families, 2003.
                              The new policy has been notified in the official gazette and has
                              become operative with effect from the 31st October, 2007. Many
                              State Governments have their own Rehabilitation and Resettlement
                              Policies. Many Public Sector Undertakings or agencies also have their
                              own policies in this regard.
                                    10. The law would apply when Government acquires land for
                              its own use, hold and control, or with the ultimate purpose to
                              transfer it for the use of private companies for stated public purpose
                              or for immediate and declared use by private companies for public
                              purpose. Only rehabilitation and resettlement provisions will apply
                              when private companies buy land for a project, more than 100 acres
                              in rural areas, or more than 50 acres in urban areas. The land
                              acquisition provisions would apply to the area to be acquired but the
                              rehabilitation and resettlement provisions will apply to the entire
                              project area even when private company approaches Government
                              for partial acquisition for public purpose.
                                    11. "Public purpose" has been comprehensively defined, so
                              that Government intervention in acquisition is limited to defence,
                              certain development projects only. It has also been ensured that
                              consent of at least 80 per cent of the project affected families is to
                              be obtained through a prior informed process. Acquisition under
                              urgency clause has also bee limited for the purposes of national

                              defence, security purposes and Rehabilitation and Resettlement
                              needs in the event of emergencies or natural calamities only.
                                    12. To ensure food security, multi-crop irrigated land shall be
                              acquired only as a last resort measure. An equivalent area of
                              culturable wasteland shall be developed, if multi-crop land is
                              acquired. In districts where net sown area is less than 50 per cent of
                              total geographical area, no more than 10 per cent of the net sown
                              area of the district will be acquired.
                                    13. To ensure comprehensive compensation package for the
                              land owners, a scientific method for calculation of the market value
                              of the land has been proposed. Market value calculated will be
                              multiplied by a factor of two in the rural areas. Solatium will also be
                              increased up to 100 per cent of the total compensation. Where land
                              is acquired for urbanization, 20 per cent of the developed land will
                              be offered to the affected land owners.
                                    14. Comprehensive rehabilitation and resettlement package
                              for land owners including subsistence allowance, jobs, house, one
                              acre of land in cases of irrigation projects, transportation allowance
                              and resettlement allowance is proposed.
                                    15. Comprehensive rehabilitation and resettlement package
                              for livelihood losers including subsistence allowance, jobs, house,
                              transportation allowance and resettlement allowance is proposed.
                                    16. Special provisions for Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
                              Tribes have been envisaged by providing additional benefits of 2.5
                              acres of land or extent of land lost to each affected family; one time
                              financial assistance of Rs.50,000/-; twenty-five per cent additional
                              rehabilitation and resettlement benefits for the families settled
                              outside the district; free land for community and social gathering
                              and continuation of reservation in the resettlement area, etc.
                                    17. Twenty-five infrastructural amenities are proposed to be
                              provided in the resettlement area including schools and play

                              places of worship, burial and cremation grounds, village level post
                              offices, fair price shops and seed-cum-fertilizers storage facilities.
                                       18. The benefits under the new law would be available in all
                              the cases of land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
                              where award has not been made or possession of land has not been
                              taken.
                                       19. Land that is not used within ten years in accordance with
                              the purposes, for which it was acquired, shall be transferred to the
                              State Government's Land Bank. Upon every transfer of land without
                              development, twenty per cent of the appreciated land value shall be
                              shared with the original land owners.
                                       20. The provisions of the Bill have been made fully compliant
                              with other laws such as the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled
                              Areas) Act, 1996; the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest
                              Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Land Transfer
                              Regulations in Fifth Scheduled Areas.
                                       21. Stringent and comprehensive penalties both for the
                              companies and Government in cases of false information, mala fide
                              action    and   contravention   of   the   provisions   of   the   proposed
                              legislation have been provided.
                                       22. Certain Central Acts dealing with the land acquisition have
                              been enlisted in the Bill. The provisions of the Bill are in addition to,
                              and not in derogation of these Acts. The provisions of this Act can be
                              applied to these existing enactments by a notification of the Central
                              Government.
                                       23. The Bill also provides for the basic minimum requirements
                              that all projects leading to displacement must address. It contains a
                              saving clause to enable the State Governments, to continue to
                              proivde or put in place greater benefit levels than those prescribed

                              under the Bill.
                                    24. The Bill would provide for the basic minimum that all
                              projects leading to displacement must address. A Social Impact
                              Assessment (SIA) of proposals leading to displacement of people
                              through a participatory, informed and transparent process involving
                              all stake-holders, including the affected persons will be necessary
                              before these are acted upon. The rehabilitation process would
                              augment income levels and enrich quality of life of the displaced
                              persons, covering rebuilding socio-cultural relationships, capacity
                              building and provision of public health and community services.
                              Adequate safeguards have been proposed for protecting rights of
                              vulnerable sections of the displaced persons.
                                    25. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. The notes on
                              clauses explain the various provisions contained in the Bill."
                              5. The object of the New Act, is therefore, to reduce the hardship
                 faced by the owners of the land whose land is sought to be acquired and
                 other persons dependent on the land, which is sought to be acquired. The
                 new Act was brought to address the issues of rehabilitation and resettlement
                 of displaced persons, and to obviate the concerns of farmers and those
                 persons, whose livelihood was dependent on the land acquired. The New Act,
                 at the same time, aimed to facilitate acquisition for industrialization and
                 modernization in a much more transparent manner.
                              6. The new Land Acquisition Act, has been divided into 13 chapters.
                 Chapter II is dedicated to determination of social impact and public
    http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                            13
                 purposes. The Act postulates that, before the land is acquired, a social
                 impact study has to be prepared, which has to be followed by a public
                 hearing at the affected area, which is to be conducted after giving adequate
                 publicity about the date, time and venue for the public hearing. This is to
                 ascertain the views of the affected families. The social impact study has to
                 be published and the social impact assessment report/study has to be
                 evaluated by a multi-disciplinary expert group.
                              7. Under the new Act, only after the social impact is analyzed and the
                 study is approved, the process of acquisition of land begins. The new Act,
                 also provides for a strict time period within which the acquisition has to be
                 completed. Section 14 of the new Act provides that, if Notification under
                 Section 11 of the New Act (Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894) is
                 not issued within 12 months from the date of appraisal of the social
                 economic assessment report, then the report lapses and a fresh report has
                 to be published. Section 25 postulates that the award has to be made by the
                 Collector within a period of 12 months from the date of publication of the
                 declaration under Section 19. The period of two years provided under
                 Section 11-A of the old Act has been reduced to one year. The mode of
                 calculating the compensation is given in the first schedule to the New Act.

                              8. Chapter IV of the new Act deals with the process of acquisition, i.e.
                 notification etc, Chapters V to VIII provide the provisions relating to
                 Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the persons whose land is sought to be
                 acquired. Chapters IX and X deal with determination of the compensation as
                 well as the payment of the amount under the New Act.
                              9. Thus, the New Act aims to bring out more transparency in the
                 process of Land Acquisition, and ensure that the land-losers, are suitably
                 resettled, and that only those acquisitions which are truly necessary take
                 place, and that land is not indiscriminately taken over by Governments.The
                 phased manner in which this New Act is to apply, is that at the first stage a
                 Survey has to be carried out which would be followed by a notification
                 relating to the acquisition. Subsequently, the process of Rehabilitation and
                 Resettlement as well as payment of compensation to take place, so that the
                 farmers and other persons whose lands are being acquired are put to
                 minimum disadvantage.
                              10. Interestingly, Section 105 of the new Land Acquisition Act provides
                 that the provisions of the new Land Acquisition Act will not apply or would
                 apply with certain modifications to certain Central enactments under which
                 lands can be acquired. Section 105 reads as under:

                                    105. Provisions of this Act not to apply in certain cases or to
                              apply with certain modifications.–(1) Subject to sub-section (3),
                              the provisions of this Act shall not apply to the enactments
                              relating to land acquisition specified in the Fourth Schedule.
                                    (2) Subject to sub-section (2) of section 106, the Central
                              Government may, by notification, omit or add to any of the
                              enactments specified in the Fourth Schedule.
                                    (3) The Central Government shall, by notification, within
                              one year from the date of commencement of this Act, direct that
                              any of the provisions of this Act relating to the determination of
                              compensation    in   accordance     with    the   First   Schedule     and
                              rehabilitation and resettlement specified in the Second and Third
                              Schedules, being beneficial to the affected families, shall apply to
                              the cases of land acquisition under the enactments specified in the
                              Fourth   Schedule    or   shall   apply    with   such    exceptions    or
                              modifications that do not reduce the compensation or dilute the
                              provisions of this Act relating to compensation or rehabilitation
                              and resettlement as may be specified in the notification, as the
                              case may be.
                                    (4) A copy of every notification proposed to be issued under
                              sub-section (3), shall be laid in draft before each House of
                              Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days
                              which may be comprised in one session or in two or more
                              successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session
                              immediately following the session or the successive sessions
                              aforesaid, both Houses agree in disapproving the issue of the
                              notification or both Houses agree in making any modification in
                              the notification, the notification shall not be issued or, as the case
                              may be, shall be issued only in such modified form as may be
                              agreed upon by both the Houses of Parliament.

                              11. This section is meant to ensure that provisions of the new Land
                 Acquisition Act do not apply to acquisition made under certain Central
                 enactments. The acquisitions made under Acts protected by Section 105 of
                 the New Act, are not bound by the procedure of Survey of the New Act, but
                 will still be mandated to provide compensation and rehabilitation which will
                 be at par with the New Act. Thus the Parliament has deemed it fit to exempt
                 the process of Survey and Notification in respect of acquisition of certain
                 lands, under the specified enactments. Parliament has however made sure
                 that any person who loses land is acquired under these statues, would not
                 be worse off from a person whose land is acquired under the New Act.
                 Persons whose lands are acquired under the enactment protected under the
                 new Act would be entitled to appropriate compensation and rehabilitation.
                 The only discernible difference between the two would be that the
                 compulsory survey process under the new Act, would no longer be
                 necessary, under the enactments found in the 4th Schedule to the new Act,
                 2013.
                              12. Government of India brought out an ordinance on 31.12.2014
                 substituting sub section (3) in Section 105 of the new Act. Clause 10 of the
                 ordinance which substitutes sub section (3) in Section 105 reads as under:
                                     " (3) The provisions of this Act relating to the

                                the     Second    Schedule     and     infrastructure    amenities    in

                                Schedule with effect from 1st January, 2015."
                              13. This ordinance lapsed and Government of India therefore brought
                 out another ordinance on 3.4.2015 which was called "The Right to Fair
                 Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
                 Resettlement (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 (No.4 of 2015), once again
                 bringing out the same substitution. Clause 12 of this Ordinance reads as
                 under:

3\. After the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act, the following Schedule
shall be added, namely:-

3\. The Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 2002)."
25\. This Bill was sent to the President for his assent. It is pertinent to
mention that the new Bill was in tune with the new Act. The President gave his
assent on 01.01.2015 and the Right to Fair Compensation and Rehabilitation and
Resettlement (Tamil Nadu) Act, 2014 came into force. The Amendment Act reads
as under:
http://www.judis.nic.in  38 TAMIL NADU GOVERNMENT GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY
CHENNAI, MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 2015 Margazhi 21, Jaya, Thiruvalluvar Aandu–2045
Part IV—Section 2 Tamil Nadu Acts and Ordinances The following Act of the
Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly received the assent of the President on the
1st January 2015 and is hereby published for general information:— ACT No. 1
OF 2015.
An Act to amend the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 in its application to
the State of Tamil Nadu.
BE it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu in the
Sixty-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-
1\. (1) This Act may be called the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency
in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment)
Act, 2014.
(2) It extends to the whole of the State of Tamil Nadu. (3) It shall be deemed
to have come into force on the 1st day of January 2014.
2\. In the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the
principal Act), after section 105, the following section shall be inserted,
namely:-
“105-A. Provisions of this Act not to apply to certain Tamil Nadu Acts or to
apply with certain modifications.—(1) Subject to sub- section (2), the
provisions of this Act shall not apply to the enactments relating to land
acquisition specified in the Fifth Schedule.
(2) The State Government shall, by notification, within one year from the date
of commencement of this Act, direct that any of the provisions of this Act,
relating to the determination of http://www.judis.nic.in  39 compensation in
accordance with the First Schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement
specified in the Second and Third Schedules, being beneficial to the affected
families, shall apply to the cases of land acquisition under the enactments
specified in the Fifth Schedule or shall apply with such exceptions or
modifications that do not reduce the compensation or dilute the provisions of
this Act relating to compensation or rehabilitation and resettlement as may be
specified in the notification, as the case may be. (3) A copy of the
notification proposed to be issued under sub- section (2) shall be laid in
draft before the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu and if the
Legislative Assembly agrees in disapproving the issue of the notification or
the Legislative Assembly agrees in making any modifications in the
notification, the notification shall not be issued or, as the case may be,
shall be issued only in such modified form as may be agreed upon by the
Legislative Assembly.”
3\. After the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act, the following Schedule
shall be added, namely:-
“THE FIFTH SCHEDULE.
(See section 105-A) LIST OF TAMIL NADU ENACTMENTS REGULATING LAND ACQUISITION
IN THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU.
1\. The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978
(Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1978).
2\. The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997
(Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999).
3\. The Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 2002).” (By Order
of the Governor) http://www.judis.nic.in  40
26\. Thus Section 105-A(3) was inserted by the Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 2015 into
the new Land Acquisition Act, 2013. The Section, as inserted in the New Land
Acquisition Act reads as under:
> “105-A. Provisions of this Act not to apply to certain Tamil Nadu Acts or to
> apply with certain modifications.—(1) Subject to sub-section (2), the
> provisions of this Act shall not apply to the enactments relating to land
> acquisition specified in the Fifth Schedule.
> (2) The State Government shall, by notification, within one year from the
> date of commencement of this Act, direct that any of the provisions of this
> Act, relating to the determination of compensation in accordance with the
> First Schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement specified in the Second
> and Third Schedules, being beneficial to the affected families, shall apply
> to the cases of land acquisition under the enactments specified in the Fifth
> Schedule or shall apply with such exceptions or modifications that do not
> reduce the compensation or dilute the provisions of this Act relating to

> (3) A copy of the notification proposed to be issued under sub-
section (2) shall be laid in draft before the Legislative Assembly of the
State of Tamil Nadu and if the Legislative Assembly agrees in disapproving the
issue of the notification or the Legislative Assembly agrees in making any
modifications in the notification, the notification shall not be issued or, as
the case may be, shall be issued only in such modified form as may be agreed
upon by the Legislative Assembly.”
27\. Thus Tamil Nadu Act No.1 of 2015 exempts the 3 Acts, namely a)
http://www.judis.nic.in  41 Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare
Scheme Act, 1978, b) Tamil Nadu Acquisition for Land for Industrial Purposes
Act, 1997 and c) Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001, in Schedule V from the
applicability of the procedure in the New Act, provided that the provisions
relating to Rehabilitation and Compensation payable under those acts are at
par with the New Act. Section 105-A provides that the provisions of the new
Act relating to determination of compensation in accordance with the First
Schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement specified in Second and Third
Schedule being beneficial to the affected families would apply to those Acts
mentioned in the V Schedule and the compensation and provisions of
rehabilitation and resettlement were not to be diluted.
28\. This amendment act is principally challenged in this batch of writ
petitions. By this Amendment Act, the three Acts, namely (i) The Tamil Nadu
Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 31
of 1978); (ii) The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act,
1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999); and (iii) The Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001
(Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 2002), are sought to be exempted from the applicability
of the new Act. Independent writ petitions have been filed challenging vires
of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial
Purposes Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in  42 Submissions of the Petitioners
29\. Mr.P.Wilson, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.
Nos.4397, 8368, 7222, 7223, 7224, 11380 of 2017, 5969, 23506 to 23509, 23462,
23463, 32886, 32891, 19912 to 19914, 18955 and 18956 of 2018, would submit
that Section 105-A is contrary to the spirit of the new Land Acquisition Act.
Mr.Wilson, learned senior counsel, would rely on the National Policy for
Farmers, brought out in 2007 and more particularly paragraph 4.2.1 of this
policy. He would also rely on the statement of objects and reasons and in
particular, paragraphs 11 to 16 and would submit that the new Act was brought
in, to ensure a comprehensive compensation package for the land owners, a
scientific method for calculation of market value of the land, a comprehensive
rehabilitation and resettlement package for land owners including subsistence
allowance, jobs, house, resettlement package for livelihood losers etc. He
would submit that the three State Acts which are now sought to be brought back
do not contain any such provision and therefore, it goes completely against
the very purpose for which New Act, was brought into force.
30\. Mr.Wilson, relied on the various provisions of the new Act and submitted
that they are much more beneficial to the land owners. He would submit that
the very purpose of bringing out the new Act stands defeated by inserting
Section 105-A. He submitted that just because 105-A(2) provides
http://www.judis.nic.in  43 the compensation and rehabilitation scheme should
not be diluted, does not mean, all the issues have been answered. He further
argued that if the entire scheme of the three Acts for acquiring the land are
seen and a comparison is made with the new Act, then it can be seen that there
are number of other provisions under the new Act, which are beneficial to the
land owners in comparison to the Industrial Purposes Act.Mr.P.Wilson would
rely on Sections 25, 29, 31, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 of the new Act and would
submit that there are no provision akin to these provisions in the Tamil Nadu
Acts and therefore Section 105-A which seeks to bring to life, the three
enactments, would become discriminatory. To buttress this submission,
Mr.Wilson would rely on P.VajraveluMudaliar and Another vs. Special Deputy
Collector, Madras and others reported in 1965 1 SCR 614 :
AIR 1965 SC 1017. Mr.Wilson placed reliance on paragraphs 19 and 20 of the
said judgment to contend that if there are adjacent lands belong to the same
individual, which are being acquired, a portion of the land is acquired under
a more beneficial Act, then the other portions, which is acquired under the
less beneficial Act, is per se discriminatory. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the said judgment has observed as under:
> 19.The last contention of Mr. ViswanathaSastri is that the Amending Act is
> hit by Article 14 of the Constitution. The law on the subject is well-
> settled. Under Article 14 the State shall not deny to any person equality
> before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of
> India. But this does not preclude http://www.judis.nic.in  44 the
> Legislature from making a reasonable classification for the purpose of
> legislation. It has been held in a series of decisions of this Court that
> the said classification shall pass two tests, namely,
> (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differential which
> distinguishes persons and things left out of the group; and
> (ii) the differential must have a rational relation to the object sought to
> be achieved by the statute in question. To ascertain whether the impugned
> Act satisfies the said two tests, three questions have to be posed, namely,
> (i) what is the object of the Act ? (ii) what are the differences between
> persons whose lands are acquired for the housing schemes and these whose
> lands are acquired for purposes other than housing schemes or between the
> lands so acquired? and (iii) whether those differences have any reasonable
> relation to the said object. On a comparative study of the Principal Act and

> housing scheme under the Amending Act, the claimant gets a lesser value than

> public purpose like hospital under the Principal Act. 'Me question is

> 20\. Now what are the differences between persons owning lands in the Madras

The differences based upon the said criteria have no relevance to the object
of the Amending Act. To illustrate: the extent of the land depends upon the
magnitude of the scheme undertaken by the State. A large extent of land may be
acquired for a university or for a network of hospitals under the provisions
of the Principal Act and also for a housing scheme under the Amending Act. So
too, if the housing scheme is a limited one, the land acquired may not be as
big as that required for a big university. If waste land is
http://www.judis.nic.in  46 good for a housing scheme under the Amending Act,
it will equally be suitable for a hospital or a school for which the said land
may be acquired under the Principal Act. Nor the financial position or the
number of persons owning the land has any relevance, for in both the cases
land can be acquired from rich or poor, from one individual or from a number
of persons. Out of adjacent lands of the same quality and value, one may be
acquired for a housing scheme under the Amending Act and the other for a
hospital under the Principal Act; out of two adjacent plots belonging to the
same individual and of the same quality and value, one may be acquired under
the Principal Act and the other under the Amending Act. From whatever aspect
the matter is looked at, the alleged differences have no reasonable relation
to the object sought to be achieved. It is said that the object of the
Amending Act in itself may project the differences in the lands sought to be
acquired under the two Acts. This argument puts the cart before the horse. It
is one tying to say that the existing differences between persons and
properties have a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved and
it is totally a different thing to say that the object of the Act itself
created the differences. Assuming that the said proposition is sound, we
cannot discover any differences in the people owning lands or ill. the lands
on the basis of the object. The object is to acquire lands for housing schemes
at a low price. For achieving that, object, any land falling in any of the
said categories can be acquired under the Amending Act. So too, for a public
purpose any such land can be acquired under the Principal Act. We, therefore,
hold that discrimination is writ large on the Amending Act and it cannot be
sustained on the principle of reasonable classification. We, therefore, hold
that the Amending Act clearly infringes Article 14 of the Constitution and is
void."
http://www.judis.nic.in  47
31\. He would also rely on paragraphs 27 to 31 of the judgment in Nagpur
Improvement Trust and Another vs. Vittal Rao and others reported in 1973 1 SCC
500, which reads as under:
> 27\. It is equally immaterial whether it is one Acquisition Act or another
> Acquisition Act under which the land is acquired. If the existence of two
> Acts enables the State to give one owner different treatment from another
> equally situated the owner who is discriminated against, can claim the
> protection of Article 14.
> 28\. It was said that if this is the true position the State would find it
> impossible to clear slums, to do various other laudable thing,. If this
> argument were to be accepted it would be totally destructive of the
> protection given by Art.14. It would enable the State to have, one law for
> acquiring lands for hospital, one law for acquiring lands for schools, one
> law acquiring lands for clearing slums, another for acquiring lands for
> Government buildings; one for acquiring lands in New Delhi and another for
> acquiring lands in old Delhi. It was said that in many cases, the value of
> the land has increased not because of any effort by the owner but because of
> the general development of the city in which the land is situated. There is
> no doubt that this is so, but Article 14 prohibits the expropriation of the
> un- earned increment of one owner while leaving his neighbour untouched.
> This neighbour could sell his land reap the unearned increment. If the
> object of the legislation is to tax unearned increment it should be done
> throughout the State. The State cannot achieve this object piece-
meal by compulsory acquisition of land of some owners leaving others alone. If
the object is to clear slums it cannot be done at the expense of the owners
whose lands are acquired, unless as we http://www.judis.nic.in  48 have said
the owner are directly benefited by the scheme. If the object is to build
hospitals it cannot be done at the expense of the owners of the land which is
acquired. The hospital, schools etc. must be built at the expense of the whole
community.
29\. It will not be denied that a statute cannot tax some owners of land
leaving untaxed others equally situated. If the owners of the land cannot be
taxed differently how can some owners be indirectly taxed by way of compulsory
acquisition? It is urged that if this were the, law it, willtic the hands of
the State in undertaking social reforms. We do not agree. There is nothing in
the Constitution which debars the State from bettering the lot of millions of
our citizens. For instance there is nothing to bar the State from taxing
unearned increment if the object is to deny owners the full benefit of
increase of value due to development of a town. It; seems to us, as we have
already said that to accede to the contentions of the appellant and e States
would be destructive of the protection afforded by Article 14 of the
Constitution. The States would only have to constitute separate acquiring
bodies for each city, or Division or indeed to achieve one special public
purpose and lay down different principles of compensation.
30\. In P. VajraveluMudaliar v. Special Deputy Collector, Madras(1) there were
two Acts under which the land of an owner could be acquired. The land could
have been acquired for various schemes under the Land Acquisition Act,
referred to as the Principal Act, in the judgment, and the Amending Act (The
Land Acquisition (Madras Amendment) Act, 1961). Court observed:
"The land could have been acquired for all the said purposes under the
Principal Act after paying the market value of the land. The Amending Act
empowers the State to acquire land for housing scheme at a price lower than
that the State has to pay if the same http://www.judis.nic.in  49 was acquired
under the Principal Act." The Court examined various justifications for the
classi- fications which were put forth by the State, and then concluded:-
"From whatever aspect the matter is looked at, the alleged differences have no
reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved. It is said that the
object of the Amending Act in itself may project the differences in the lands
sought to be , acquired under the two Acts. This argument puts the cart before
the horse. It is one thing to say that the existing differences between
persons and properties have a reasonable relation to the object sought to be
achieved and it is totally a different thing to say that the object of the Act
itself created the differences. Assuming that the said proposition is sound,
we cannot discover any differences in the people owning lands or in the lands
on the basis of the object. The object is to acquire lands for housing schemes
at a low price. For achieving that object, any land falling in any of the said
categories can be acquired under the Amending Act. So, too, for a public
purpose any such land can be acquired under the principal Act. We, therefore,
hold that discrimination is writ large on the Amending Act and it cannot be
sustained on the principal of reasonable classification. We, therefore, hold
that the Amending Act clearly infringes Art. 14 of the Constitution and is
void".
31\. In Balammal&Ors. v. State of Madras reported in [1969] 1 SCR 90 in which
the facts are substantially similar, the Board constituted under the Madras
City Improvement Trust Act, (Madras Act 16 of 1945) was authorised by virtue
of sec. 71, with the previous sanction of the Government, to acquire land
under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for carrying out any of
the purposes of the Act which included Town Expansion Scheme (This sec. 71 is
equivalent to see. 59 of the Improvement http://www.judis.nic.in  50 Act). For
the purpose of acquiring land for the Board under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 sec. 73 provided inter alia, that the, said Act shall be subjected to the
modifications specified in the Schedule (This section 73 corresponds to sec.
61 of theImprovement Act). The Schedule to the Act provided for modification
in the Land Acquisition Act for certain specific purposes. The Madras Act of
1945 as replaced by the Madras City Improvement Trust Act (Madras Act 37 of
1950) made an important change inasmuch as the result was that by the change
persons whose lands were compulsorily acquired under the Madras Act 37 of 1950
were deprived of the right to the solatium which would be awardable if the
lands were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. In this connection this
Court observed : "But, in our judgment, counsel for the owners is right in
contending that sub-cl. (2) of cl. 6 of the Schedule to Act 37 of 1950,
insofar as it deprived the owners of the lands of the statutory addition to
the market value of the lands under S. 23 (2) of the Land Acquisition Act is
violative of the equality clause of the Constitution, and is on that account
void. If the State had acquired the lands for improvement of the town under
the Land Acquisition Act, the acquiring authority was bound to award in
addition to the market value 15% statutory under s. 23(2) of the Land
Acquisition Act. But by acquiring the lands under the Land acquisition Act as
modified by the Schedule to the Madras City Improvement Trust Act 37 of 1950
for the Improvement Trust which is also a public purpose the owners are, it is
claimed, deprived of the right to that statutory addition. An owner of land is
ordinarily entitled to receive the solatium in addition to the market-value
for compulsory acquisition of his land, if it is acquired under the Land
Acquisition Act, but not if it is acquired under the Madras City Improvement
Trust Act. A clear case of discrimination which infringes the
http://www.judis.nic.in  51 guarantee of equal protection of the law arises,
and the owners of the lands which are compulsorily acquired must on the
decisions of, it his Court, be deemed invalid".
32\. He, therefore, submitted that in the light of the Supreme Court
judgments, Section 105-A ought to be struck down, as being discriminatory.
33\. Mr.Wilson further submitted that though earlier discrimination was not
one of the grounds available to strike down an enactment after the judgment of
the Supreme Court in Shayaro Bano & Others vs. Union of India & Others
reported in 2017 (9) SCC 1, if one Act results in discrimination, then that
Act can be struck down. Mr.Wilson relied on Paragraph Nos.72, 73, 74, 75 and
85 to substantiate this submission that Section 105-A(2) is per se
discriminatory in nature because, it brings to life the State Acts, which are
lesser beneficiary than the amended Land Acquisition Act, 2013.
72\. Close upon the heels of this judgment, a discordant note was struck in
State of A.P. v. McDowell & Co. [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co., (1996) 3
SCC 709] Another three-Judge Bench, in repelling an argument based on the
arbitrariness facet of Article 14, held: (SCC pp. 737-39, para 43) “43. Shri
Rohinton Nariman submitted that inasmuch as a large number of persons falling
within the exempted categories are allowed to consume intoxicating liquors in
the State of Andhra http://www.judis.nic.in  52 Pradesh, the total prohibition
of manufacture and production of these liquors is “arbitrary” and the amending
Act is liable to be struck down on this ground alone. Support for this
proposition is sought from a judgment of this Court in State of T.N. v.
AnanthiAmmal [State of T.N. v. AnanthiAmmal, (1995) 1 SCC 519]. Before,
however, we refer to the holding in the said decision, it would be appropriate
to remind ourselves of certain basic propositions in this behalf. In the
United Kingdom, Parliament is supreme. There are no limitations upon the power
of Parliament. No court in the United Kingdom can strike down an Act made by
Parliament on any ground. As against this, the United States of America has a
Federal Constitution where the power of the Congress and the State
Legislatures to make laws is limited in two ways viz. the division of
legislative powers between the States and the Federal Government and the
fundamental rights (Bill of Rights) incorporated in the Constitution. In
India, the position is similar to the United States of America. The power of
Parliament or for that matter, the State Legislatures is restricted in two
ways. A law made by Parliament or the legislature can be struck down by courts
on two grounds and two grounds alone viz. (1) lack of legislative competence,
and (2) violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of
the Constitution or of any other constitutional provision. There is no third
ground. We do not wish to enter into a discussion of the concepts of
procedural unreasonableness and substantive unreasonableness—concepts inspired
by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Even in USA, these
concepts and in particular the concept of substantive due process have proved
to be of unending controversy, the latest thinking tending towards a severe
curtailment of this ground (substantive due process). The main
http://www.judis.nic.in  53 criticism against the ground of substantive due
process being that it seeks to set up the courts as arbiters of the wisdom of
the legislature in enacting the particular piece of legislation. It is enough
for us to say that by whatever name it is characterized, the ground of
invalidation must fall within the four corners of the two grounds mentioned
above. In other words, say, if an enactment is challenged as violative of
Article 14, it can be struck down only if it is found that it is violative of
the equality clause/equal protection clause enshrined therein. Similarly, if
an enactment is challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights
guaranteed by sub-clauses (a) to (g) of Article 19(1), it can be struck down
only if it is found not saved by any of clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 and
so on. No enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary [
An expression used widely and rather indiscriminately—an expression of
inherently imprecise import. The extensive use of this expression in India
reminds one of what Frankfurter, J. said in Hattie Mae Tiller v. Atlantic
Coast Line Railroad Co., 87 L Ed 610 : 318 US 54 (1943), “A phrase begins life
as a literary expression; its felicity leads to its lazy repetition and
repetition soon establishes it as a legal formula, undiscriminatingly used to
express different and sometimes contradictory ideas”, said the learned Judge.]
or unreasonable. Some or other constitutional infirmity has to be found before
invalidating an Act. An enactment cannot be struck down on the ground that
court thinks it unjustified. Parliament and the legislatures, composed as they
are of the representatives of the people, are supposed to know and be aware of
the needs of the people and what is good and bad for them. The court cannot
sit in judgment over their wisdom. In this connection, it should be remembered
that even in the case of administrative action, the http://www.judis.nic.in
54 scope of judicial review is limited to three grounds viz. (i)
unreasonableness, which can more appropriately be called irrationality, (ii)
illegality and (iii) procedural impropriety (see Council of Civil Service
Unions v. Minister for Civil Service [Council of Civil Service Unions v.
Minister for Civil Service, 1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 : (1984) 3 All ER
935 (HL)] which decision has been accepted by this Court as well). The
applicability of doctrine of proportionality even in administrative law sphere
is yet a debatable issue. (See the opinions of Lords Lowry and Ackner in R. v.
Secy. of State for Home Deptt., ex p Brind [R. v. Secy. of State for Home
Deptt., ex p Brind, 1991 AC 696 : (1991) 2 WLR 588 : (1991) 1 All ER 720 (HL)]
, AC at pp. 766-67 and 762.) It would be rather odd if an enactment were to be
struck down by applying the said principle when its applicability even in
administrative law sphere is not fully and finally settled. It is one thing to
say that a restriction imposed upon a fundamental right can be struck down if
it is disproportionate, excessive or unreasonable and quite another thing to
say that the court can strike down enactment if it thinks it unreasonable,
unnecessary or unwarranted.”
73\. This judgment in McDowell & Co. case [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co.,
(1996) 3 SCC 709] failed to notice at least two binding precedents, first, the
judgment of a Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia [Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib
Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC 722 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 258] and second, the judgment of
a coordinate three-Judge Bench in Lakshmanan [K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of
T.N., (1996) 2 SCC 226]. Apart from this, the reasoning contained as to why
arbitrariness cannot be used to strike down legislation as opposed to both
executive action and subordinate legislation was as follows.
74\. According to the Bench in McDowell [State of A.P. v.
http://www.judis.nic.in  55 McDowell and Co., (1996) 3 SCC 709] , substantive
due process is not something accepted by either the American courts or our
courts and, therefore, this being a reiteration of substantive due process
being read into Article 14 cannot be applied. A Constitution Bench in Mohd.
Arif v. Supreme Court of India [Mohd. Arif v. Supreme Court of India, (2014) 9
SCC 737 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 408] has held, following the celebrated Maneka
Gandhi [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248] , as follows:
(Mohd. Arif case [Mohd. Arif v. Supreme Court of India, (2014) 9 SCC 737 :
(2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 408] , SCC pp. 755-56, para 27-28) “27. The stage was now
set for the judgment in Maneka Gandhi [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978)
1 SCC 248] . Several judgments were delivered, and the upshot of all of them
was that Article 21 was to be read along with other fundamental rights, and so
read not only has the procedure established by law to be just, fair and
reasonable, but also the law itself has to be reasonable as Articles 14 and 19
have now to be read into Article 21. [See at SCR pp. 646-48: SCC pp. 393-95,
paras 198-204 per Beg, C.J., at SCR pp. 669, 671-74 &687 : SCC pp. 279-84 &
296-97, paras 5-7 & 18 per Bhagwati, J. and at SCR pp. 720-23 : SCC pp.
335-39, paras 74-85 per Krishna Iyer, J.]. Krishna Iyer, J. set out the new
doctrine with remarkable clarity thus: (SCR p. 723: SCC pp. 338-39, para 85)
‘85. To sum up, “procedure” in Article 21 means fair, not formal procedure.
“Law” is reasonable law, not any enacted piece. As Article 22 specifically
spells out the procedural safeguards for preventive and punitive detention, a
law providing for such detentions should conform to Article 22. It has been
rightly pointed out that for other rights forming part of personal
http://www.judis.nic.in  56 liberty, the procedural safeguards enshrined in
Article 21 are available. Otherwise, as the procedural safeguards contained in
Article 22 will be available only in cases of preventive and punitive
detention, the right to life, more fundamental than any other forming part of
personal liberty and paramount to the happiness, dignity and worth of the
individual, will not be entitled to any procedural safeguard save such as a
legislature's mood chooses.’
28\. Close on the heels of Maneka Gandhi case [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of
India, (1978) 1 SCC 248] came Mithu v. State of Punjab [Mithu v. State of
Punjab, (1983) 2 SCC 277 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 405] , in which case the Court noted
as follows: (SCC pp. 283-84, para 6) ‘6. … In Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn.
[Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn., (1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 155] while
dealing with the question as to whether a person awaiting death sentence can
be kept in solitary confinement, Krishna Iyer, J. said that though our
Constitution did not have a “due process” clause as in the American
Constitution; the same consequence ensued after the decisions in Bank
Nationalisation case [Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC
248] and Maneka Gandhi case [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC
248] .… In Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 :
1980 SCC (Cri) 580] which upheld the constitutional validity of the death
penalty, Sarkaria J., speaking for the majority, said that if Article 21 is
understood in accordance with the interpretation put upon it in Maneka Gandhi
[Maneka http://www.judis.nic.in  57 Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC
248] , it will read to say that: (SCC p. 730, para 136) “136. ‘No person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to fair, just and
reasonable procedure established by valid law.’ ” ’ The wheel has turned full
circle. Substantive due process is now to be applied to the fundamental right
to life and liberty.”
75\. Clearly, therefore, the three-Judge Bench in McDowell case [State of A.P.
v. McDowell and Co., (1996) 3 SCC 709] has not noticed Maneka Gandhi [Maneka
Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248] cited in Mohd. Arif [Mohd. Arif v.
Supreme Court of India, (2014) 9 SCC 737 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 408] to show
that the wheel has turned full circle and substantive due process is part of
Article 21 as it is to be read with Articles 14 and 19.
85\. The third reason given is that the courts cannot sit in judgment over
parliamentary wisdom. Our law reports are replete with instance after instance
where parliamentary wisdom has been successfully set at naught by this Court
because such laws did not pass muster on account of their being
“unreasonable”, which is referred to in Om Kumar [Om Kumar v. Union of India,
(2001) 2 SCC 386 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 1039] . We must never forget the admonition
given by Khanna, J. in State of Punjab v. Khan Chand [State of Punjab v. Khan
Chand, (1974) 1 SCC 549] . He said: (SCC p. 558, para 12) “12. It would be
wrong to assume that there is an element of http://www.judis.nic.in  58
judicial arrogance in the act of the courts in striking down an enactment. The
Constitution has assigned to the courts the function of determining as to
whether the laws made by the legislature are in conformity with the provisions
of the Constitution. In adjudicating the constitutional validity of statutes,
the courts discharge an obligation which has been imposed upon them by the
Constitution. The courts would be shirking their responsibility if they
hesitate to declare the provisions of a statute to be unconstitutional, even
though those provisions are found to be violative of the Articles of the
Constitution. Articles 32 and 226 are an integral part of the Constitution and
provide remedies for enforcement of fundamental rights and other rights
conferred by the Constitution. Hesitation or refusal on the part of the courts
to declare the provisions of an enactment to be unconstitutional, even though
they are found to infringe the Constitution because of any notion of judicial
humility would in a large number of cases have the effect of taking away or in
any case eroding the remedy provided to the aggrieved parties by the
Constitution. Abnegation in matters affecting one's own interest may sometimes
be commendable but abnegation in a matter where power is conferred to protect
the interest of others against measures which are violative of the
Constitution is fraught with serious consequences. It is as much the duty of
the courts to declare a provision of an enactment to be unconstitutional if it
contravenes any article of the Constitution as it is theirs to uphold its
validity in case it is found to suffer from no such infirmity.” This again
cannot detain us.
http://www.judis.nic.in  59
34\. Mr.P.Wilson, learned senior counsel would contend that Section 105-A is
manifestly arbitrary and deserves to be struck down by applying the ratio of
Shayaro Bano & Others vs. Union of India.He further submitted that the
judgment of a Hon'ble Division Bench of this court in K.Ramakrishnan vs.
Government of Tamil Nadu represented by Secretary, Industries Department dated
02.03.2007 which upheld the validity of the Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition for
Industrial Purposes Act, 1997, would not be a binding precedent, as the
judgment is contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and
should be ignored as per incuriam.
35\. Mr.P.Wilson further submitted that Section 105-A is a piece of
conditional legislation. According to him, Section 105-A(1) is subject to the
provisions of Section 105-A(2). Section 105-A(2) mandates that the State
Government, shall, by notification, within one year from the date of
commencement of this Act direct that the provisions of this Act relating to
determination of compensation according to First schedule and provisions
relating to rehabilitation and resettlement in the Second and Third schedules
being beneficial to the affected families shall apply to all acquisitions
under the acts specified in the Fifth Schedule. The provisions relating to
compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement may be adopted with such some
modification that does not reduce the compensation or dilute the provisions of
this Act. According to Mr.Wilson, if Section 105-A(1) is to
http://www.judis.nic.in  60 operate, it was mandatory on the part of the State
Government to bring out a notification within one year from the date of
commencement of this Act.
According to Mr.Wilson, the term "This Act" refers to the amended Land
Acquisition Act which came into force on 01.01.2014. He submitted that since
there was no notification by 01.01.2015, section 105-A did not come into force
at all. He would submit that Section 105-A is a still-born Act, which cannot
be implemented. In the alternative, he would further submit that, in any
event, no notification has been issued till date in accordance with Section
105-A(3). He would submit that issuance of notification is mandatory.
36\. He would submit that Section 105A(3) mandates that the draft notification
so issued under Section 105-A(2) has to be placed before the Assembly. If the
Assembly disapproves the notification, then no notification can be issued. If
the Assembly suggests a modification in the notification, then the
notification has to be modified and can be issued only in the modified form.
He would state that Section 105-A (1) shall apply only if the conditions,
namely, (i) a notification is issued in terms of Section 105-A(3) and (ii) the
notification is placed before the assembly.
37\. Mr.Wilson would further rely on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in M.R.F. Limited vs. Manohar Parrikar and Ors. http://www.judis.nic.in
61 reported in 2010 (11) SCC 374, ShayaraoBano vs. Union of India and others
reported in 2017 (9) SCC 1, Vasu Dev Singh and Ors. vs. Union of India and
Ors. reported in 2006 (12) SCC 753, 1998 (1) SCC 318, Deena Alias DeenDayal
and others vs. Union of India and others reported in 1983 (4) SCC 645,
M/s.Atlas Industries Ltd., and others vs. State of Haryana reported in 1979
(2) SCC 196, B.K.Srinivasan and Ors. vs. State of Karnataka and Ors. reported
in (1987) 1 SCC 658 and Collector of Central Excise vs. New Tobacco Co. and
Ors. reported in 1998 (8) SCC 250.
38\. Mr.Wilson would also submit that Land Acquisition Act being ex-
proprietary in nature, could not be brought with retrospective effect. To
buttress the same, he would rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., vs. Darius Shapur, Chennai reported in
2005 (7) SCC 627 and Lakshman Lal (Dead) through LRs vs. State of Rajasthan
reported in 2013 (3) SCC 764,. Mr.Wilson would submit that even if Section
105-A is said to be a valid piece of legislation, then the Industrial Purposes
Act has to be struck down as it discriminates between two land owners. He
would rely on P.VajraveluMudaliar and Another vs. Special Deputy Collector,
Madras and others reported in 1965 1 SCR 614 : AIR 1965 SC 1017 and Nagpur
Improvement Trust and Another vs. Vittal Rao and others reported in 1973 1 SCC
500. http://www.judis.nic.in  62
39\. Mr.Wilson would state that Section 7(6) of the Industrial Purposes Act
which is the provision for payment of compensation is unworkable. He would
state that under Section 7(6) of the Industrial Purposes Act compensation is
to be calculated on the basis of Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,
which has not been repealed. Mr.Wilson would rely on Section 8 of the General
Clauses Act, to contend that even if the Land Acquisition Act is repealed,
compensation can be calculated only on the basis of the provisions mentioned
under Sections 23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and therefore,
Section 7(6) automatically becomes repugnant to Section 105-A(2) of the new
Act, as inserted by Tamil Nadu Amendment Act. He would therefore submit that
under Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997,
compensation cannot be calculated because one cannot look into the new Land
Acquisition Act (the inserted provisions) for calculating compensation for
acquisition under the Tamil Nadu Land Acquisition for Industrial Purposes Act.
Mr.Wilson would state that method of calculation of compensation is
legislative in nature and that cannot be delegated to the executive. According
to Mr.Wilson, Section 105-A(2) also suffers from the vires of excessive
delegation.
40\. Mr.N.Subramaniyan appearing in W.P. No.5893 of 2018 submitted that on and
from 01.01.2014, Tamil Nadu Highways Act and Tamil Nadu Land
http://www.judis.nic.in  63 Acquisition for Industrial Purposes Act have
become void. According to him, by virtue of Article 254(1), Tamil Nadu
Highways Act, stands impliedly repealed. For this proposition he relied on the
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s.Innoventive Industries Ltd. vs.
ICICI Bank reported in 2018 (1) SCC 407, ZaverbhaiAmaidas vs. State of Bombay
reported in AIR 1954 SC 752 and T.Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe and Another reported
in 1983 (1) SCC 177. According to him, the new Act covers every aspect of land
acquisition and therefore, once the new Act has come into force, Tamil Nadu
State Highways Act stands impliedly repealed and once it is impliedly
repealed,Section 105-A cannot bring life to an Act which is dead. According to
him, it is well settled that whenever an Act is repealed it must be considered
as if it never existed. Mr.N.Subramaniam would rely on State of Uttar Pradesh
& Others Vs. Hirendra Pal Singh, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as
under:-
> "It is a settled legal proposition that whenever an Act is repealed, it must
> be considered as if it had never existed. The object of repeal is to
> obliterate the Act from the Statutory books, except for certain purposes as
> provided under Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Repeal is not a
> matter of mere form but is of substance. Therefore, on repeal, the earlier
> provisions stand obliterated/abrogated/wiped out wholly i.e., pro tanto
> repeal (vide Daig Ram Pindi Lal Vs. Thrilok Chand Jain 1992 (2) SCC 113,
> Gajraj Singh Vs. STAT, 1997 (1) SCC 650, Property Owners Association Vs.
> State of Maharashtra 2001 (4) SCC 455 and Mohan Raj Vs. Dinbeswari Saikia
> 2007 (15) SCC 115"
http://www.judis.nic.in  64
41\. He further submitted that Section 105-A is still born and cannot come
into force at all.
42\. Mr.N.Subramaniyan would also submit that the term "This Act"
mentioned in Section 105-A(2) would mean the new Act and therefore, on
1.1.2015 i.e. on the date on which the President gave his assent since the
State Government had not brought out a Notification as contemplated under
Section 105-A(2) of the Act, it could not have come into force. He would
reiterate the submissions of Mr.P.Wilson that Section 105-A(2) is completely
arbitrary and deserves to be set aside. Mr.N.Subramaniyan further submitted
that the assent granted by the President is not correct and reflects the
complete non application of mind. According to him, entire materials have not
been placed before the President before the assent was granted. He reiterated
that when it was repealed, it was construed that the State enactments never
existed after 01.01.2015 and that since the whole Act stood was not in
existence, it could not be resurrected by Section 105-A.
43\. Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy, expanded the proposition given by
Mr.N.Subramaniyan. He would submit that, on 01.01.2014, all the State Acts
stood repealed. To buttress his submission, he would place reliance on the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Zaverbhai Amaidas vs. State of Bombay
reported in AIR 1954 SC 752, paragraphs 9 to 11 and T.Barai
http://www.judis.nic.in  65 vs. Henry Ah Hoe and Another reported in 1983 (1)
SCC 177. He would further state that once the Act stood impliedly repealed, it
could have been resurrected only by a fresh legislation. He would rely on the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PT.Rishikesh and Another vs Salma
Begum (Smt.) reported in (1995) 4 SCC 718, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has observed under:
> "The ratio therein must be understood in the light of the facts therein.
> Rule 72 of Order 21 CPC was amended by the State legislature, equally the
> Central Act repealed the existing rule and re-enacted the rule so as to be
> self-operative and complete code consistent with the development of the law.
> Therefore, the Bench held that State amendment since was not consistent with
> the Central Act, the State amendment was declared repugnant to the Central
> Act. Therefore, it became void unless it was re-enacted by the State
> Legislature, reserved for consideration and received the assent of the
> President."(emphasis supplied)
> 44\. He would also rely on paragraph 9 of the judgment in M.Karunanidhi vs.
> Union of India reported in AIR 1979 SC 898.
According to Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy, merely by inserting a Fifth Schedule
and putting the State enactment in the Fifth Schedule, cannot bring back to
life an Act which is dead. He would also place reliance on a Full Bench
judgment of the Delhi High Court in P.L.Mehra vs. D.R.Khanna reported in AIR
1971 Del 1, which states that when the State Act has become void, the only
course open is to re-enact the whole of the said Act. He would adopt the
arguments of Mr.P.Wilson and contended that the Highways Act and the
Industrial Purposes Act, are manifestly arbitrary. He would also adopt the
http://www.judis.nic.in  66 contention of Mr.P.Wilson that the Acts should be
struck down on the grounds of arbitrariness for which purpose he also placed
reliance on ShayaroBano'scase.
45\. Apart from the judgments cited by Mr.P.Wilson, Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy,
relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Kerala &
Others vs. T.M.Peter and others reported in 1980 3 SCC 554, P.C.Goswami v.
Collector of Darrang reported in (1982) 1 SCC 439 and Nikesh Tarachand Shah v.
Union of India & Another reported in (2018) 11 SCC 1 for this purpose. He
would also adopt the arguments of Mr.P.Wilson, that Section 105-A is a
conditional legislation and that the condition prescribed in the legislation
has not been fulfilled. The Act has not come into force.
46\. Mr.K.M.Vijayan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner would
also reiterate that the New Act could not be retrospectively amended and that
shows complete non-application of mind by the President while granting assent.
He would submit that Section 105-A is completely unworkable, since the three
Acts which were sought to be inserted in Fifth schedule were dead. He further
stateD that Section 105-A(2) suffers from the vires of excessive delegation
and that the executive could not have been http://www.judis.nic.in  67
empowered to perform a legislative function which Section 105-A permits.
According to Mr.K.M.Vijayan, there has to be corresponding amendment in the
various sections of the State enactments that Section 105-A(2) to be
unworkable. Section 7(c) of the Industrial Purposes Act, has to be amended to
bring in line with Section 30 of the new Land Acquisition Act. According to
Mr.K.M.Vijayan, Section 105-A(2) when the bill was forwarded, the President of
India without being satisfied the exact repugnancy and therefore in the
absence of material before the President, it would be stated that there was
complete non-application of mind. To buttress his argument, Mr.K.M.Vijayan
would rely on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kaiser-I-Hind Pvt.
Ltd. and Others vs. National Textile Corporation reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182.
47\. He would also submit that Section 105-A is a conditional legislation and
performance of those conditions was mandatory and since the notification,
which is to be brought within one year of the commencement of the new Land
Acquisition Act has not been brought out, section 105-A cannot be said to be
in existence. According to Mr.Vijayan, the present property now sought to be
acquired is in violation of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.
48\. Mr.Ajmal Khan, learned senior counsel would primarily reiterate the
http://www.judis.nic.in  68 submissions of Mr.P.Wilson. He focused his
submissions on the non-
application of mind by the President. He would rely on the Covering Note by
the Law Secretary along with the Bill would state that the nature of
inconsistencies that were not brought to the knowledge of the President. He
would rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kaiser-Hind Pvt.
Ltd. and Another vs. National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. and
others reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182, to submit that the courts can go into the
question as to whether such materials are placed or not, before the President.
According to him, the nature of inconsistency should have been brought out
before the President.
49\. Mr.T.V.Ramanujun, learned Senior Counsel would adopt the submissions of
other counsel and would submit that Section 105-A suffers from the vires of
discrimination and has to be struck down. He would also submit that, if it is
assumed that Section 105-A(2) is a valid legislation, then the provisions of
calculation of compensation, at the time of passing award etc. under the State
Act, would be inconsistent with the Central Act and therefore, these Acts are
not workable and would suffer from arbitrariness.
50\. Mr.M.S.Subramaniam, learned counsel would also broadly support the
submissions made by the other counsel. He submitted that to state that the
entire field of acquisition of land has been occupied by the Central
http://www.judis.nic.in  69 legislation and there cannot be any such
legislation governing the field. He would reiterate the arguments that the
mandatory conditions under Section 105-A(2) has not been applied. Learned
counsel relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
BishambarDayalChandramohan vs. State of UP reported in 1982 (1) SCC 39, and
GovindlalChaggan Lal Patel vs. The Agricultural Produce Market Committee,
Godhra & Others reported in 1975 (2) SCC 482 for this purpose. He would also
state that the Government orders passed by the State Government is not the Law
and therefore, the Government orders are violative of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India. He would also rely on (1995) 3 SCC 661 to support the
arguments of non-application of mind on the part of the President.
51\. One more argument which all the learned counsel made was that, the three
Government orders extracted supra, cannot take the place of a notification.
They would rely on Section (19-A) of the Tamil Nadu General Clause Act 1891,
which defines notification as under:-
19-A "notification" shall mean a notification published in the Official
Gazette;] :
52\. They would also rely on Section 3(v) of the Right to Fair Compensation
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013, which reads as under:-
http://www.judis.nic.in  70 " (v) -notification means a notification published
in the Gazette of India or, as the case may be, the Gazette of a State and the
expression -notify? shall be construed accordingly;"
53\. According to the petitioners, the conditions specified in Section
105-A(2) have not been fulfilled inasmuch as (a) Government Order is not
notification, as it does not fulfill the definition of notification; (b) the
Government order has not been placed before the two houses of the Legislature,
which is mandatory. The counsel for the petitioners would, submit that
valuable properties would be taken away in violation of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India, which stipulates that no person can be deprived of his
property save by authority of law.
54\. The learned counsel for the petitioners would also further submit that
G.O. is only based on Article 162 of the Constitution of India, which states
that the explicit power of the State is coexistence that the legislative power
according to them once the Act is void and there is no legislation, the
Government Order cannot operate in vacuum, more so when there is a legislation
by the Central Government and the Government Order is contrary to the
provisions of the new Land Acquisition Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in  71 Submissions of the State of Tamil Nadu:
55\. Mr.Vijay Narayan, learned Advocate General, would submit that Bill
No.5/2014, was introduced in the State of Tamil Nadu for enacting Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014. Section 105-A, which was sought
to be introduced by the said Bill reads as under:
> "l05-A. Provisions of this Act not to apply to certain. Tamil Nadu Acts or
> to apply with certain modifications.
> (1) Subject to sub-section (2), the provisions of this Act shall not apply
> to the enactments relating to land acquisition specified in the Fifth

> be, shall be issued only in such modified form as may be agreed upon by the
> Legislative Assembly."
> 3\. After the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act, Addition of Fifth
> Schedule.
> the following Schedule shall be added, namely:— "THE FIFTH SCHEDULE.
(See section 105-A) http://www.judis.nic.in  72 LIST OF TAMIL NADU ENACTMENTS

2\. The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997
(Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999).
3\. The Tamil Nadu Highways,Act, 2001 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 2002)"
56\. The Bill did not get the assent of the President and a fresh Bill, namely
Bill No.30/2014 was introduced. 105-A reads under:
> “105-A. Provisions of this Act not to apply to certain Tamil Nadu Acts or to

(2) The State Government shall, by notification, within one year from the date

Schedules, being beneficial to the affected families, shall apply to the cases
of land acquisition under the enactments specified in the Fifth Schedule or
shall apply with such exceptions or modifications that do not reduce the
compensation or dilute the provisions of this Act relating to compensation or
rehabilitation and http://www.judis.nic.in  73 resettlement as may be
specified in the notification, as the case may be.
(3) A copy of the notification proposed to be issued under sub- section (2)
shall be laid in draft before the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil
Nadu and if the Legislative Assembly agrees in disapproving the issue of the
notification or the Legislative Assembly agrees in making any modifications in
the notification, the notification shall not be issued or, as the case may be,
shall be issued only in such modified form as may be agreed upon by the
Legislative Assembly.”
57\. A comparison of two proposed sections would show that in the former bill
introduced, it was the prerogative of the State Government to issue a
Notification after one year from the date of commencement of the principal Act
and it only dealt with the determination of compensation in accordance with
the schedule. In the latter bill, it became mandatory. The word used was
'shall' for the purpose of issuance of notification and it also provided not
only compensation, but rehabilitation settlement in accordance with Second and
Third schedule would also be taken into consideration and the provisions in
the amended Land Acquisition Act, would be applicable. He further stated that
the bill got the assent of the President and was gazetted, and Section 105-A
was sought to be introduced.
58\. The learned Advocate General would state that, Sub section (3)(i)
http://www.judis.nic.in  74 of the amending Act states that the newly inserted
provision shall be deemed to have come into force from 01.01.2014. According
to the learned Advocate General, once Section 105-A is deemed to have come
into effect on 01.01.2014 then, all the three State enactments are deemed to
be in the V schedule on 01.01.2014 and therefore, the concept of implied
repeal does not arise. According to the learned Advocate General, the
contention that the three State enactments have become void to the extent of
their being repugnant to the Central Act on the Central Act coming to force
cannot hold water for the reason the amendment to the Land Acquisition Act by
insertion of Section 105-A is deemed to have come to force from the day on
which the Central Act came to force. The learned Advocate General would rely
on Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gurupad Khandappa Magdum vs
Hirabai Khandappa Magdum reported in 1978 (3) SCC 383, which quotes with the
approval the proposition of law laid down by Lord Asquith in East End
Dwellings Co. Ltd Vs. Finsbury Borough Council (1951) 2 All ER 587, as under:
> "If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of affairs as real, you must
> also imagine as real the consequences and incidents which, if the putative
> state of affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably have flowed from or
> accompanied it;
and if the statute says that you must imagine a certain state of affairs, it
cannot be interpreted to mean that having done so, you must cause or permit
your imagination to boggle when it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that
state of http://www.judis.nic.in  75 affairs."
59\. According to the learned Advocate General, if Section 105-A was in force
on 01.01.2014 itself, then there was no question of implied repeal and the
enactments mentioned in the V Schedule would be saved from the applicability
of the Central Act, right from 1.1.2014. According to the learned Advocate
General, Section 105-A(2) specifically provides that the method of
calculation, compensation and the schemes of rehabilitation etc. would be
applicable to the State enactments.
60\. The learned Advocate General would contend that since the compensation
payable under the three State enactments and the the schemes for
rehabilitation and resettlement would also be in line with the new Land
Acquisition Act, there is no question of any repugnancy between the new Land
Acquisition Act and three State enactments.
61\. The learned Advocate General would further submit that there is no
question of any discrimination in as much as the payment of compensation and
the schemes of rehabilitation in the three State Acts which have been placed
in Schedule V to the new Land Acquisition Act is not different from the new
Land Acquisition Act. The learned Advocate General would submit that Article
254 of Constitution of India would not be attracted in the absence of any
repugnancy. The learned Advocate General would http://www.judis.nic.in  76
further submit that in the absence of any repugnancy there can be more than
one enactment for the purpose of acquisition of land. The learned Advocate
General would rely on the judgment of 7 Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in MagganlalChhaganlal (P) Ltd. vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater
Bombay and others reported in AIR 1974 SC 2009 : (1974) 2 SCC 402 to
substantiate a submission that there can be more than one enactment in the
same field.
62\. The learned Advocate General, submitted that the Government orders dated
31.12.1994 issued by the Highways, Minor Ports Department and Adi Dravidar and
Tribal Welfare Department, must be read as a notification which is deemed to
come into force on 1.1.2014. The Advocate General, therefore, submitted that,
this would validate the actions taken by the Government. He would say that
Section 105-A takes care of the compensation that is to be awarded for
acquisitions under three State enactments. He would state that Section
105-A(2) guides the purpose of the compensation and rehabilitation.
63\. According to the learned Advocate General, Section 105-A(3) is not
mandatory. According to the learned Advocate General the word 'shall' in the
first portion of section 105-A(3) is only directory and that the Government
may place the notification before the Houses of the Assembly. The learned
http://www.judis.nic.in  77 Advocate General placed reliance on Atlas Cycle
Industries vs. State of Haryana reported in 1979 (2) SCC 196, Quarry Owners'
Association vs. State of Bihar reported in 2000 (8) SCC 655 and The
Prohibition & Excise Supdt., A.P. & Ors. vs. Toddy Tappers Coop. Society,
Marredpally&Orsreported in 2003 (12) SCC 738, and K.P. Plantations vs. State
of Karnataka reported in 2011 (9) SCC 1 to substantiate his contention that
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that failure to place the
notification before the Assembly is not fatal and the notification does not
cease to be in force, even if it is not placed before the Assembly.
The learned Advocate General would state that the notification can be placed
even now, before the House and the defect if any in not placing the
notification before the Assembly, can be cured.
64\. The learned Advocate General would rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the State of Tamil Nadu vs AnanthiAmmal reported in 1995 AIR
SC 2114 to state that the validity of the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for
Harijan Welfare Scheme was upheld, as not being violative of Articles 14, 19
and 300-A of the Constitution of India. The learned Advocate General would
rely on the judgment of the Madras High Court in a batch of writ petitions in
K.Ramakrishnan vs. The Government of Tamil Nadu in W.P. No.40850 of 2005
(Batch) dated 02.03.2007, upholding the validity of the Industrial Purposes
Act. By this Judgement, the http://www.judis.nic.in  78 Madras High Court held
that two Acts can operate in the respective fields and there is no repugnancy
and that both the Acts considered in the light of the respective two natural
characters. The learned Advocate General relied on N.Sathishkumar vs.
Secretary to Government reported in 2017 SCC online Mad 18861, wherein this
court observed as under.
> "14. As discussed above, Sub Sections 1 and 3 of Section 105- A of the Act 1
> of 2015 are distinct and different. If one reads Sub Section (1), there is
> no doubt that it exempts the enactments relating to land acquisition
> specified in the Fifth Schedule.
Admittedly, the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Lands for Industrial Purposes Act,
1997, comes under Fifth Schedule. The only exemption that is given is with
respect to the provisions which are not made applicable to the enactments
relating to the land Acquisition specified in the Fifth Schedule is to the
contingency specified under Sub Section 2. Thus, when the provision dealing
with the compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement under Act 30 of 2013 is
beneficial and gives more succour to a land owner divested with the land than
the one provided under the enactments mentioned in the Fifth Schedule, then
such a provision will have to be applied notwithstanding an acquisition made
under those enactments. As there is no dispute that the provisions governing
compensation under Act 30 of 2013 are more beneficial than the one provided
under the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes 1997, a
notification is sought to be made as mandated under Section 105-A sub clause 2
of Act 1 of 2015. Therefore, sub clause 2 of Section 105-A of the Act 1 of
2015, in specific terms, deals with the factors mentioned therein and thus,
has got no direct connection with the “acquisition of land” under the Acts
mentioned in the Fifth Schedule as such. In the case on hand, it is not
necessary to go into the issue pertaining to the http://www.judis.nic.in  79
non-publication of the notification since the respondents have agreed to grant
the benefit. Suffice it is to state that even assuming that a notification has
not been issued and published by the State Government, that by itself will not
set at naught or nullify the acquisition made.
15\. There is no repugnance involved. This is for the reason, Section 105-A of
the Act 1 of 2015 itself gives a clearance for an acquisition under the Tamil
Nadu Acquisition of Lands for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997. Though under
Section 114 of the Act 30 of 2013, the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894)
has been repealed, the provisions of compensation available under the Tamil
Nadu Act 10 of 1999, under Section 7(6) would not become inoperative. This
provision as rightly submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
second respondent is a piece of legislation by incorporation. Thus, even
though the provision contained under Sections 23 and 24 and other relevant
provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 are made applicable to determine
the compensation amount under Section 7 of Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999, the said
section shall continue to be in statute. To put it otherwise, repealing of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 would not have any bearing on the provisions of the
Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999, though certain provisions of the earlier Act have
been borrowed into it. This position of law has been held way back in the year
1963 in RAM SARUP v. MUNSHI (AIR 1963 Supreme Court 553) the following is
fruitful recapitulation of relevant passage.
“(1) Definition of “agricultural land’ under S.3(1): Where the provisions of
an Act are incorporated by reference in a later Act the repeal of the earlier
Act has, in general, no effect upon the construction or effect of the Act in
which its provisions have been http://www.judis.nic.in  80 incorporated. The
effect of incorporation is stated by Brett, L.J., in Clarke v. Bradlugh,
(1881) 8 QBD 63.
“Where a statute is incorporated, by reference, into a second statute the
repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second.” In the
circumstances, therefore, the repeal of the Punjab Alienation of Land Act of
1900 has no effect on the continued operation of the Preemption Act and the
expression ‘agricultural land’ in the later Act has to be read as if the
definition in the Alienation of Land Act had been bodily transposed into it.”
16\. Therefore, the contention of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioner that there is neither a provision for compensation under Tamil Nadu
Act 10 of 1999 nor under Act 30 of 2013 available to the petitioners and thus,
the entire land acquisition proceedings would become nullity, cannot be
sustained in the eye of law."
65\. However, this court held that it is to be noted that in the said
decision, the vires of Section 105-A had not been challenged. The learned
Advocate General had also placed reliance on S.S.Thangatthevan vs. Government
of Tamil Nadu in W.P. (MD) No.1329 of 2015 (Batch)dated 1.3.2018, observed as
under:
> "63. Therefore, this Court finds that the respondents have issued a notice
> under Section 15(2) of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act and the main point urged
> in these writ petitions by the petitioners is that instead of invoking the
> Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
> Rehabilitation and Resettlement http://www.judis.nic.in  81 (Tamil Nadu

> Schedule, the operation of the Principal Act is dispensed with. The Tamil
> Nadu Highways Act 2001 also got inserted in the V schedule."
66\. The learned Advocate General would also rely on K.Ramakrishnan vs. The
Government of Tamil Nadu in W.P.
No.40850 of 2005 (Batch) dated 02.03.2007, which held that Highways Act is not
limited to application alone and is a composite Act, for all the activities of
the Highways and the acquisition is only explanatory. According to the learned
Advocate General, the Highways Act, in pith and substance, is only for the
purpose of Highways and the fact, which is incidental, it also provides for
provision for acquiring land for the purpose of Highways, would not make this
Act repugnant to the Central Act, because in pith and substance the Highways
Act does not deal with acquisition, which is covered only under the Land
Acquisition Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in  82
67\. Mr.P.H.Arvindh Pandian, learned Additional Advocate General, appearing
for SIPCOT and TANGEDCO submitted that, it cannot be argued that there was no
material before the President and the President sans the material, has given
his assent. He would further state that three Bills had been placed before the
President of India. In Bill No.5 dated 22.2.2014, he would submit that the
President of India did not grant his assent on that Bill and it was returned.
It was only when the President was satisfied that the defects pointed out,
while returning the said Bill were cured. The President gave his assent. All
necessary information and material were furnished for specific reference with
regard to three Acts.
68\. With regard to repugnancy, the learned Additional Advocate General, would
rely on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Engineering Kamgar Union
vs. Electro Steels Castings Ltd. and Another reported in 2004 (6) SCC 36 and
Dr.Krushna Chandra Sahu and others vs. State of Orissa and others reported in
1995 (6) SCC 1, to substantiate his contention. He would also state that for
the three Acts, which are now sought to be put in the Fifth Schedule, the
assent of the President has been given and it cannot be said that the three
Acts were not there with the President.
69\. It is the submission of the learned Additional Advocate General
http://www.judis.nic.in  83 that both the Acts apply in their respective
fields. According to him, judgment of ShayaroBano's case is not applicable to
the facts of the case.
He placed reliance on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of
Mysore & Another vs D.Achiah Chetty etc. reported in 1969 (1) SCC 248 and
Subramanian Swamy vs. Director, CBI & Another reported in 2014 (8) SCC 682, to
buttress his contention.
Submissions in rejoinder:
70\. Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy, in his rejoinder submitted that the contention
of the Advocate General on the deeming provision, cannot be accepted. He would
even state that assuming that the Act came into force on 1.1.2014, yet it
cannot be restituted. Mr.Parthasarathy will contend that the Central Act
(Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013) received the assent on 27.9.2013
and the moment the President gave his assent, Article 254 comes in, and
thereafter the three Acts became repugnant on that very day.
He would say that making Section 105-A, as deemed to have come into force from
1.1.2014 is of no consequence. Mr.Parthasarathy would place reliance on State
of Kerala vs. Mar AppraemKuri Co. Ltd. reported in 2012 (7) SCC 106, wherein
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that repugnancy arises on the making and not
from the commencement of the Act. He would further argue that the moment the
President gives his assent http://www.judis.nic.in  84 to the Bill, the law is
made and once the law is made, then all the State Acts which operate in
concurrent list, would become repugnant to the Central Act and therefore, he
contends that though the State Act comes into force only on 1.1.2014, the date
on which the Central Act came into force, the deeming fiction still not
validate section 105-A. Introducing Section 105-A in the Central Legislation
even after obtaining the assent of the President is no answer to the question
of repugnancy.
71\. To respond to these submissions, Mr. Arvindh Pandian, Learned Additional
Advocate General has placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Jagannath v. Authorised Officer, Land Reforms, (1971) 2 SCC 893 to
submit that it is not necessary to re-enact the three state enactments for
them to have the force of law.

23\. Apart from the question as to whether fundamental rights originally
enshrined in the Constitution were subject to the amendatory process of
Article 368 it must now be held that Article 31-B and the Ninth Schedule have
cured the defect, if http://www.judis.nic.in  86 any, in the various Acts
mentioned in the said Schedule as regards any unconstitutionality alleged on
the ground of infringement of fundamental rights, and by the express words of
Article 31-B such curing of the defect took place with retrospective operation
from the dates on which the Acts were put on the statute book. These Acts even
if void or inoperative at the time when they were enacted by reason of
infringement of Article 13(2) of the Constitution, assumed full force and
vigour from the respective dates of their enactment after their inclusion in
the Ninth Schedule, read with Article 31-B of the Constitution. The States
could not, at any time, cure any defect arising from the violation of the
provisions of Part III of the Constitution and therefore the objection that
the Madras Ceilings Act should have been re-enacted by the Madras legislature
after the Seventeenth Constitutional Amendment came into force cannot be
accepted.
Summary of Arguments Advanced:
> 72\. Contentions of the petitioners can be summarized as under:
> i) Even though the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
> Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, new Act came into
> force on 1.1.2014 it got the assent of the President on 27.09.2014.
On that date itself, the three Acts, namely Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for
Harijan Welfare Scheme Act, 1978, Tamil Nadu Acquisition for Land for
Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 and Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001, had become
repugnant in the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pt.
Rishikesh v. Salma Begum reported in (1995) 4 SCC 718 and State of Kerala v.
Mar http://www.judis.nic.in  87 AppraemKuri Co. Ltd. reported in (2012) 7 SCC
106. The amended Act, therefore, could not bring to life to the three Acts
which were not in existence on 1.1.2014.
ii) Section 105-A(2) mandates that the Government has to by notification
within one year from the date of commencement of this Act i.e. from 1.1.2014
bring out a Notification relating to the determination of compensation in
accordance with the new Act. The Government has not brought out the
notification and therefore Section 105-A(1) which is subject to sub section
(2) could never have come into force.
iii) The notification has not been laid before the Assembly under Section
105(3). Section 105(3) is mandatory and therefore Section 105-A could never
have come into force. Even assuming without admitting that the three Acts have
come in back to force, they have to be struck down as being discriminatory.
The stand of the Government is as under "pithily put".
73\. The arguments of the State of Tamil Nadu can be summarized as follows:
> i) Section 1 (3) of the amending Act states that it shall be deemed to have
> been come into force on 1.1.2014. The courts must give fullest efforts to
> the deeming provision.
ii) The Government orders dated 31.12.2014 is sufficient compliance of Section
105(2) which states that the compensation payable under the three State
Enactments shall http://www.judis.nic.in  88 at no cost will be lesser than
the amount and the rehabilitation schemes will also be in tune with the new
Land Acquisition Act.
iii) 105-A(3) which states that the notification should be placed before the
assembly is only directory and not mandatory.
Issues:
> 74\. The issues therefore, which arise for our consideration are:
> 1) Are the State Enactments void because of inherent Arbitrariness?
2) Did the President of India fail to apply his mind while granting assent to
Section 105A?
3) Did the Impugned State Enactments become repugnant once the Parliament
‘made’ the New Land Acquisition Act. If so, did the presidential assent to
Section 105A inserted by Tamil Nadu Act No. 1 of 2015, revive the three acts?
4) Are the provisions of Section 105A(2) and (3) mandatory, and if so, whether
non-compliance of these provisions fatal to the validity of these enactments.
Arbitrariness of the Impugned State Enactments:
75\. It has been extensively argued at the bar, that the three state
enactments ought to be struck down on account of the fact that they violate
Article 14 of the Constitution of India, and they suffer from the vice of
arbitrariness.
http://www.judis.nic.in  89
76\. The argument as to whether the three State enactments have to be struck
down because of the fact that they will be hit by Article 14 of the
Constitution of India, need not deter us. The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land
for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978, was upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in State of Tamil Nadu and Others vs AnanthiAmmal and Others reported in AIR
1995 SC 2114. In the said judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
> "28. This is an appeal by the owner of land whose land was sought to be
> acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of
> a Harijan Welfare Scheme after the coming into force of the said Act, that
> is the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Lands for Harijan Welfare Scheme Act, 1978
> the appellant filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court for a direction
> to the State to for bear from continuing with the proceedings under the Land
> Acquisition Act having regard to the provisions of Section 20 of the said
> Act which required that for such purpose land could be acquired only in
> accordance with the provisions of the said Act. The learned single Judge
> dismissed the writ petition and the Division Bench the appeal filed
> therefrom, both on the ground that said Act, had been struck down as
> unconstitutional. Hence this appeal.
29\. We have held the provisions of the said Act to be valid legislation
except in so far as they provide for payment of the compensation amount in
instalments. The said Act being valid legislation,its provisions preclude the
State from acquiring land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme under
the Land Acquisition Act. The appeal is allowed and the proceedings under the
Land Acquisition Actto acquire http://www.judis.nic.in  90 the appellant's
land for the purpose of a Harijan Welfare Scheme are, therefore, quashed and
set aside."
77\. Similarly, the validity of the State Highways Act is upheld and the
validity of Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Lands for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997
in a batch of writ petitions in W.P. No.29555 etc. N.Sathish Kumar &Ors.
vs. Secretary to Government, Industries Department, Government of Tamil Nadu
and Ors. reported in MANU/TN/1116/2017, wherein it was argued that the Act
should be struck down has been violative of Article 14, this court rejected
the contention in paragaraphs 14 to 16 quoted supra.
Similarly, the question as to whether the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, is
repugnant to the new Act, this court in S.N.Sumathi vs. State of Tamil Nadu
and Ors. reported in MANU/TN/0882/2015 observed as under :
> "13. Now the contentions raised by the petitioners is that though there is
> no provision under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act 2001 on par with either under

> belonging to the petitioners under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act 2001 were
> deemed to have lapsed, since even after lapse of four years, the respondents

14\. As per Sec.11A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the Collector shall
make an Award under Sec.11 within a period of two years from the date of the
publication of the declaration http://www.judis.nic.in  91 and if no Award is
made within that period, the entire proceedings for the acquisition of the
land shall lapse.
15\. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 came into force w.e.f.1.1.2014. As
per Sec.114 of the said Act, the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was repealed . The
Tamil Nadu Highways Act 2001 came into force on 1.12.2002. As per Sec.68 of
the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
shall cease to apply to any land, which is required for the purpose specified
in Sec.15(1) of the Act and any such land shall be acquired by the Government
only in accordance with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act.
However, in Sec.19(6) of the Act in determining the compensation, the
Collector shall be guided by the provisions contained in Secs.23 and 24 and
other relevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 subject to
modification that in sections 23 and 24, the reference to the date of
publication of the Notification under Sec.4(1) and the date of publication of
the declaration under Sec.6 of the said Act shall be construed as reference to
the date of publication of the notice under sub sections (2) and (1)
respectively, of Sec.15 of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act.
16\. Secs.23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 shall apply for the
guidance of the determination of the amount for the lands acquired subject to
modification contained in Section 19(6) of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act. The
provisions similar to Sec.11(a) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 has been
incorporated in Sec.25 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, whereby the
Collector shall make an http://www.judis.nic.in  92 Award within a period of
twelve months from the date of publication of the declaration under Sec.19 and
if no award is made wtihin that period, the entire proceedings for the
acquisition of the land shall lapse. However, the Government shall have the
power to extend the period of 12 months if in its opinion, circumstances exist
justifying the same and any such decision to extend the period shall be
recorded in writing and the same shall be notified and be uploaded on the
website of the authority concerned.
17\. Under Sec.19(11) of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, the Collector shall
dispose of every case referred to him under sub-section (3) for determination
of amount as expeditiously as possible and in any case within six months from
the date of such reference. Though the time limit has been fixed for
determination of compensation under Sec.19(11) of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act,
the main diffference between the Tamil Nadu Highways Act and the other two
Acts is that after the expiry of the period of two years under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 and after the expiry of 12 months period Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013, the entire proceedings will lapse. But in the Tamil
Nadu Highways Act, even after the expiry of six months period contemplated
under Sec.19(11) of the Act, it will not lapse. However, under Sec.24 of the
Tamil Nadu Highways Act, when the amount is not paid or deposited on or before
taking possession of the land, the Government shall pay the amount determined
with interest thereon at the rate of nine percent per annum from the time of
so taking possession until it shall have been so paid or deposited.

19\. It is also pertinent to note that in the Acquisition of Land for Harijan
Welfare Scheme Act 1978 and in the Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for
Industrial Purposes Act also, there is no provision similar to Sec.11A of the
Land Acquisition Act 1894 or Sec.25 of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
has been incorporated. Vires of the Acquisition of land for Harijan Welfare
Scheme Act was also challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1995 SC 2114 (State of
Tamil Nadu and Others vs AnanthiAmmal and Others) upheld the validity of the
provisions contained in the Act except the provisions contained under Sec.11
providing for payment of compensation amount in instalments.
22\. In the case on hand, under Sec.19(11) of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, the
Collector should determine the compensation within six months. If the
Collector does not determine the compensation within six months, under Sec.24
of the Act, the land owners are entitled to the interest at the rate of 9% p.a
which has been included for compensating any disadvantage that may be caused
to the land owners.
36\. Before parting with, since it is for the Legislature to modify, amend or
repeal the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, I would like to suggest
that the Legislature may consider amending the Act by incorporating an outer
time limit for determination of the compensation by the District Collector and
in the case of not completing the determination within the stipulated period,
the legislature may consider introducing the deemed provisions as found in
Sec.11A of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 and also in Sec.25 of Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
http://www.judis.nic.in  94 Resettlement Act, 2013, which will be advantageous
to the land owners, who were deprived of their lands in the acquisition
proceedings under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, for getting a higher
compensation. The authorities may do the needful in this regard."
78\. Similarly, a Hon'ble Division Bench of this court in K.Ramakrishnan vs.
Government of Tamil Nadu reported in 2007 W.L.R. 372, while dealing with the
challenge to Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act and
the Rules, upheld the Industrial Purposes Act, by holding as under:
> "30. Resultantly,
> (i)the T.N.Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act and the Rules
> framed thereunder does not suffer from lack of legislative competency of the
> State Government and therefore, the same are held constitutionally valid;
> (ii)the impugned acquisition proceedings initiated under the T.N.Acquisition
> of Land for Industrial Purposes Act does not suffer any illegality,
> irrationality, or procedural impropriety; and
> (iii)the writ petitions and connected miscellaneous petitions are dismissed.
> No costs."
79\. The argument of the learned counsel for the parties, more particularly,
Mr.P.Wilson that the three State enactments ought to be struck down on the
ground of discrimination in the matter of computation and payment of
compensation cannot be accepted. Section 105-A(2) and the
http://www.judis.nic.in  95 Government orders categorically states that the
compensation has to be paid under the three State enactments will not be
lesser than the compensation awarded under the new Land Acquisition Act.
Similarly, it is also observed and accepted that a rehabilitation scheme and
resettlement scheme would also be not lesser than the new Land Acquisition
Act. It can therefore be said that the three State enactments are governed
completely by new Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of grant of
compensation and for resettlement/rehabilitation. Therefore, it cannot be said
that there is discrimination. A Bench of seven Judges MaganlalChhaganlal (P)
Ltd. vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay & Others reported in AIR 1974
SC 2009 : (1974) 2 SCC 402, has held that there could be two Acts in the same
field if it is not direct conflict to each other. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
has remarked as under:
> "45. It would on this view appear to be unnecessary to consider whether the
> special procedure set out in Chapter VA of the Municipal Act is
> substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the ordinary procedure of a
> civil suit. That is one more requirement which must be satisfied before the
> special procedure provided in Chapter VA of the Municipal Act can be
> condemned as discriminatory. We should not have ordinarily proceeded to
> consider whether this requirement is satisfied or not as it is unnecessary
> to do so, but since we find that there is some confusion in regard to this
> question which needs to be cleared up and the mist of uncertainty
> surrounding this question needs to be dispelled, we propose to deal with
> this question. We may point at the outset — http://www.judis.nic.in  96 and
> this must be constantly borne in mind, for otherwise it is likely to distort
> the proper perspective of Article 14 — that mere minor differences between
> the two procedures would not be enough to invoke the inhibition of the
> equality clause. The equality clause would become the delight of legal
> casuistry and be shorn of its real purpose which is to provide hope of equal
> dispensation to the common man — “the butcher, the baker and the candle
> stick maker” — if we indulged in weaving gossamer webs out of this guarantee
> of equality or started meticulous hunt for minor differences in procedure.
> What the equality clause is intended to strike at are real and substantial
> disparities, substantive or processual and arbitrary or capricious actions
> of the executive and it would be contrary to the object and intendment of

> substantially more drastic and prejudicial than the other and not mere
> superfine differences which in this imperfect world of fallible human
> instruments are bound to exist when two procedures are prescribed. We should
> avoid dogmatic and finical approach when handling life’s flexible
> realities."
80\. The purpose of acquisition under all the four Acts, namely new Act and
three State Acts are different. The compensation provided under all the
http://www.judis.nic.in  97 four Acts is going to be identical, the
rehabilitation and resettlement scheme too shall be identical. In view of the
above, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.VajraveluMudaliar and
Another vs. Special Deputy Collector, Madras and others reported in 1965 1 SCR
614 : AIR 1965 SC 1017 and Nagpur Improvement Trust and Another vs. Vittal Rao
and others reported in 1973 1 SCC 500 will not apply to the facts of the case.
The purpose of the new Act is not going to be defeated by placing the three
State Acts in the V Schedule and stating that the new Act will not apply to
them. The argument is therefore not accepted, and the Acts cannot be struck
down on the ground of arbitrariness.
81\. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners have also contended that in view of
the Judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of ShayaraBano v. Union
of India, (2017) 9 SCC 1, this Court can strike down the impugned state
enactments on the ground of “manifest arbitrariness.” We therefore deem it
appropriate to examine the scope of Manifest Arbitrariness. The Supreme Court
in the case of ShayaraBano has held as under:
> "101. It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of this Court in Indian
> Express Newspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of India89 stated that it was
> settled law that subordinate legislation can be challenged on any of the
> grounds available for challenge against plenary legislation. This being the
> case, there is no rational http://www.judis.nic.in  98 distinction between
> the two types of legislation when it comes to this ground of challenge under
> Article 14. The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down in
> the aforesaid judgments would apply to invalidate legislation as well as
> subordinate legislation under Article 14. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore,
> must be something done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally and/or
> without adequate determining principle. Also, when something is done which
> is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be manifestly
> arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of
> manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate
> legislation as well under Article 14.
> [Emphasis Supplied]"
82\. The Judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shayara Bano’s case is
clear insofar as it lays down that the only when the legislature does
something capriciously, irrationally or without adequate determining
principle, the action so done can be struck down as being manifestly
arbitrary. From the facts of this case, the enactment of the three impugned
State Acts, can in no way be held to irrational, capricious, or without
adequate determining principle, and therefore this argument of the Petitioners
deserves to be rejected.
Did the President of India apply his mind while granting assent to the Tamil
Nadu Act no. 1 of 2015 http://www.judis.nic.in  99
83\. Submissions were made at great length at the bar contending that the
President of India has failed to apply his mind while granting assent to Tamil
Nadu Act No. 1 of 2015. We will now proceed to deal with these submissions.
84\. The State Government have obtained assent of the President on 5.1.2015.
The assent of the President was obtained because of the fact that Entry 42
List III deals with acquisitions and requisitions of the property.
Since the new Act has come into force the three state enactments were
impliedly repealed. The State Government, have, therefore, obtained the assent
of the President to ensure that the provisions of the three State enactments
would be applicable to the State of Tamil Nadu.
85\. Mr.P.Wilson and Mr.M.S.Subramaniam, both strenuously argued that the
copies of the three Acts which were repugnant to the Central Act had not been
placed before the President. On 15.12.2014, the Law Secretary sent a letter to
the President of India for consideration of the President. The said letter
along with all the annexures read as under:
> MOST IMMEDIATE Law Department, STATE LEGISLATION Secretariat Chennai - 600

2\. In order to continue acquisition of land under the Tamil Nadu Acquisition
of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 (Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1978), the
Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu
Act 10 of 1999) and the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of
2002), after the date of commencement of the Rights to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
(Central Act 30 of 2013) and to apply the provisions of the Central Act 30 of
2013 for determination of compensation to the cases of land acquisition under
the said Tamil Nadu Acts, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, http://www.judis.nic.in  101 Rehabilitation and Resettlement
(Tamil Nadu Amendment) Bill, 2014 (L.A. Bill No.5 of 2014) was passed by the
Legislative Assembly on 20.02.2014 and reserved by the Governor for the
consideration of the President. The Government have now decided to apply the
provisions of Central Act 30 of 2013 relating to rehabilitation and
resettlement also to the cases of land acquisition under the said Tamil Nadu
Acts, in addition to compensation. Accordingly, the Government have taken a
policy decision to withdraw the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Bill,
2014 (L.A. Bill No.5 of 2014) and to introduce a fresh amendment Bill,
incorporating certain changes, on the lines of the provisions of Section 105
of the Central Act 30 of 2013. The Bill authorises the State Government to
issue a clarification to apply the provisions of Central Act 30 of 2013
relating to determination of compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement to
the cases of land acquisition under the above said Tamil Nadu Acts. The Bill
seeks to given effect to the above decision.
3\. The Bill falls, mainly, within the scope of the following entries of the
State and Concurrent Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution,
namely:-
STATE LIST Entry 18:- Land, that is to say, rights in or over land........
CONCURRENT LIST Entry 42:- Acquisition and requisitioning of property and is
intra-vires the State Legislature.
4\. The law made by the Parliament on the subject "Acquisition and
requisitioning of property", namely, the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and http://www.judis.nic.in
102 Resettlement Act, 2013 (Central Act 30 of 2013) contains procedure for
acquisition of land for the purposes specified therein. Besides that, the said
Act contains provisions relating to compensation, rehabilitation,
resettlement, etc. The Bill seeks to amend the said Central Act 30 of 2013 so
as to insert a new section 105-A in the said Act on the lines of the
provisions of Section 105 of the Central Act 30 of 2013, in its application to
the State of Tamil Nadu. The proposed new section 105-A seeks to provide that
the provisions of the said Central Act 30 of 2013 will not apply to the Tamil
Nadu enactments relating to land acquisition specified in the Fifth Schedule
and authorise the State Government to issue a notification to apply the
provisions of Central Act 30 of 2013 relating to determination of
compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement to the cases of land acquisition
under the said Tamil Nadu Acts. The provisions of new Section 105-A may be
said to be repugnant to the provisions of the said Central Act 30 of 2013.
Therefore, the Bill has been reserved for the consideration of the President
under Article 254(2) of the Constitution.
5\. I am also directed to enclose a Certificate, as required by the Government
of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi in their D.O. Letter
No.F.17/23-72/Judl., dated the 3rd August 1972.
6\. I am, therefore, directed to request that the Government of India will be
so good as to obtain the assent of the President to the Bill and to return two
authentic copies of the Bill to the Government with the assent of the
President signified thereon, expeditiously.

G.JAYACHANDRAN http://www.judis.nic.in  104 SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT
//Forwarded By Order// Section Officer.
86\. According to the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners
since the three Acts were not sent to the President, it cannot be said that
the President could have applied its mind on the Acts in question.
The petitioner relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kaiser-
I-Hind Pvt. Ltd. And Another vs. National Textile Corpn.
(Maharashtra North) Ltd. & Others reported in (2002) 8 SCC 182, wherein the
Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraph 65 observed as under:
> "65. The result of the foregoing discussion is:
> 1\. It cannot be held that summary speedier procedure prescribed under the
> PP Eviction Act for evicting the tenants, sub-tenants or unauthorised
> occupants, if it is reasonable and in conformity with the principles of
> natural justice, would abridge the rights conferred under the Constitution.
> 2\. (a) Article 254(2) contemplates “reservation for consideration of the
> President” and also “assent”. Reservation for consideration is not an empty
> formality. Pointed attention of the President is required to be drawn to the
> repugnancy between the earlier law made by Parliament and the contemplated
> State legislation and the reasons for having such law despite the enactment
> by Parliament.
> (b) The word “assent” used in clause (2) of Article 254 would in context
> mean express agreement of mind to what is proposed by the State.
http://www.judis.nic.in  105
(c) In case where it is not indicated that “assent” is qua a particular law
made by Parliament, then it is open to the Court to call for the proposals
made by the State for the consideration of the President before obtaining
assent.
3\. Extending the duration of a temporary enactment does not amount to
enactment of a new law. However such extension may require assent of the
President in case of repugnancy."
87\. It is argued that consideration by the President is not an empty
formality when attention of the President was drawn to the repugnancy between
the law made and the law contemplated by State legislation and the reasons for
having such law, despite the enactment by Parliament. The submissions of the
learned counsel for the petitioner is that the very fact that the President
has granted assent to the Tamil Nadu Act No. 1 of 2015, without considering
the repugnancy in the State enactments, shows that he has not applied his
mind, and that if the President had applied his mind, assent would not have
been given.
88\. We are afraid that the arguments of the learned counsel can be accepted.
The letter of the Secretary categorically states that in order to continue the
acquisition of the lands under the three Acts, the Government have decided to
seek the assent of the President. Paragraph 4 of the said letter specifies as
to why Section 105-A has been inserted. The copies of the Bills, as introduced
in the Assembly, and copies of the deemed submissions http://www.judis.nic.in
106 showing relevant sections exists and after the proposed amendment, has
been given. It is also important to mention that the three Acts, namely (i)
The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978
(Tamil Nadu Act 31 of 1978); (ii) The Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for
Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 (Tamil Nadu Act 10 of 1999); and (iii) The Tamil
Nadu Highways Act, 2001 (Tamil Nadu Act 34 of 2002), under which lands are
sought to be acquired by putting them in the V Schedule had also obtained the
assent of the President on 21.7.1978, 25.5.1999 and 16.9.2002 respectively.
Copies of the Acts were therefore available with the President. All the
materials were available with the President and thus therefore it cannot be
said that there was non-application of mind on the part of the President while
granting assent. It is also to be remembered that the First Bill was returned
only on the ground of inconsistency between the three Acts. The submission
that the President has not applied his mind to the repugnancy while granting
assent to the bill, therefore cannot be accepted, and is rejected by this
Court.
89\. Repugnancy, effect of deeming provisions in the Amendment Act and did the
Impugned State Enactments become repugnant once the Parliament ‘made’ the New
Land Acquisition Act.
If so, did the presidential assent to Section 105A inserted by Tamil Nadu Act
No. 1 of 2015, revive the three acts?
http://www.judis.nic.in  107
90\. Before Adverting to rival submissions, it is important to examine the law
relating to repugnancy, in the context of the power to legislate of the Centre
and the State. Article 246 of the Constitution of India deals with the
distribution of legislation powers as between the Union and the State
Legislatures with reference to the different lists in the Seventh schedule.
The Parliament has full and exclusive power to legislate in respect of matters
in List 1. States however, exercise exclusive powers to legislate in respect
of matters in List 2. The Parliament has the power to legislate on matters in
respect of list 3. The State government too enjoys concurrent power with
respect to matters included in List 3. Issues arise when there is
inconsistency between laws made by the Legislatures and laws made by the
Parliament in respect of matters enumerated in List 3.
91\. Article 254 deals with resolution of such inconsistencies. Article 254
reads as under:
> "254. (1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is
> repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is
> competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to
> one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the
> provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before
> or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may
> be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislature of
> the http://www.judis.nic.in  108 State shall, to the extent of the
> repugnancy, be void.
> (2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State 1 *** with respect to one
> of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision
> repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an
> existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the
> Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the
> consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that
> State:
> Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting
> at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding
> to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the
> State."
92\. A reading of Article 254 reveals that Article 254(1) gives overriding
effect to the provisions of law made by the parliament, which the parliament
is competent to enact or to any provision or to any existing law in respect of
matters enumerated in List 3 and if a law made by a State Legislature is
repugnant to the provisions of the law made by the Parliament, then the law
made by the legislature of the State is treated to be void to the extent of
the repugnancy. It could be seen that so far as clause (1) of Article 254 is
concerned, which clearly sets out where any provision of law made by the
legislation of the State, is repugnant to any provision of law made by the
Parliament then to the extent of repugnancy, the State law would be void.
This means that when law is made by both the states and Parliament under their
power to legislate under List 3, then the Act passed by the Parliament whether
made prior in point of time or later, will prevail and consequently,
http://www.judis.nic.in  109 the state Act will have to yield to the Central
Act.
93\. However, Article 254(2) contemplates that where a law made by the
Legislature of a State contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of
the earlier law made by the parliament, then the law made by the legislature
of the State, shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the
President and has received his assent will prevail in the State.
94\. The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that insofar
as the State Act is concerned, it will prevail in the State and will override
the law made by the Parliament in its applicability to the State.
Land acquisition falls in the concurrent list meaning thereby both the State
legislature and the parliament are competent to enact laws. The Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, is the law made by the parliament, which covers the
entire field in all matters relating to acquisition of land, payment of
compensation and other subjects. Various state governments have enacted laws
for acquiring land in their respective States for different purposes after
obtaining the assent of the President and these laws are applicable in the
respective States even if they contained provisions which are inconsistent
with the provisions contained in the Land Acquisition Act. The State of Tamil
Nadu has also enacted (i) Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare
Scheme Act, 1978, (ii) Tamil Nadu Acquisition for Land for Industrial Purposes
Act, 1997 and (iii) Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001. The State
http://www.judis.nic.in  110 obtained assent of the President on 21.7.1978,
25.5.1999 and 16.9.2002 in respect of these three statutes, respectively.
95\. As already discussed, the Parliament was of the view that the Old Act,
1864 Act is resulting in drastic reduction of agricultural lands, and ensuring
that agriculturalists were turned into landless poor. There were was no scheme
for rehabilitating persons who have lost their livelihood/land, and the
Parliament thought it fit to bring out the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013,
the New Act. The effect of the New Act is that on the date when the said Act
was made, the three State enactments, namely Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land
for Harijan Welfare Scheme Act, 1978, Tamil Nadu Acquisition for Land for
Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 and Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001, which
contained provisions inconsistent to the new Land Acquisition Act, would
become void, insofar as repugnancy is concerned.
96\. The Government of Tamil Nadu brought out G.O. Ms. No.45 dated 14.5.2014
stating that pursuant to the commencement of the New Act, executive
instructions were issued in G.O. No.88 and how to proceed with further action
on pending land acquisition cases which had already been initiated under the
Old Act, based on the provisions laid down in Section 24(1) of the New Act.
The Government order states that the State of Tamil http://www.judis.nic.in
111 Nadu had enacted three State Acts, namely Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land
for Harijan Welfare Scheme Act, 1978, Tamil Nadu Acquisition for Land for
Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 and Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001. The
Government Order states that the State Government had considered it necessary
to continue with the acquisition of land under the State Acts for a period of
one year on the same lines as provided under Section 105 of the new Act, which
exempts 13 Central enactments specified in the Fourth schedule and enables
continuation of the acquisition of land under the State enactments for a
limited period of one year from the date of commencement of new Land
Acquisition Act.
97\. The said G.O. No.45 further states that, to give effect to the decision
to new Land Acquisition Act, Tamil Nadu Amendment Bill 2014 (LA 5/2014) has
been passed to amend the new Act, so as to continue acquisition of lands under
the above mentioned Acts for a period of one year from the date of
commencement of the new Land Acquisition Act, by including the three State
Acts, in a newly inserted Fifth Schedule and the Government of India has been
requested to obtain the assent of the President.
98\. In pursuance to the said GO, the State Government issued three Government
Orders dated 31.12.2014 in G.O. Ms. No.169 Highways and
http://www.judis.nic.in  112 Minor Ports (HF1) Department, G.O. Ms. No.251
Industries (SIPCOT-LA) Department and G.O. (Ms) No.110, Adi Dravidar and
Tribal Welfare (LA2) Department.
99\. Bill No.5/2014 stated above was sent to the President for effecting the
amendment under the new Land Acquisition Act. The bill has been extracted
above.
100\. The said bill, as stated earlier, was returned with defects. The bill
was redrafted after curing the defects and once again sent to the President
for his assent. The said bill was sent with a covering letter dated
15.12.2014. The President gave his asset on 1.1.2015 and the amendment came
into effect from 1.1.2015. Amendment Act has already been extracted.
101\. It is the contention of the petitioners that all the State enactments
have been repealed by the New Act. The petitioners for this proposition,
placed reliance on ZaverbhaiAmaidas vs. State of Bombay reported in AIR 1954
SC 752 : (1955) 1 SCR 779, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as
under:
> "7. This is, in substance, a reproduction of Section 107(2) of the
> Government of India Act, the concluding portion thereof being incorporated
> in a proviso with further additions. Discussing the nature of the power of
> the Dominion Legislature, Canada, in relation to that of the Provincial
> Legislature, in a situation similar to http://www.judis.nic.in  113 that

8\. In the present case, there was no express repeal of the Bombay Act by Act
52 of 1950 in terms of the proviso to Article 254(2). Then the only question
to be decided is whether the amendments made to the Essential Supplies
(Temporary Powers) Act by the Central Legislature in 1948, 1949 and 1950 are
“furthers legislation” falling within Section 107(2) of the Government of
India Act or “law with respect to the same matter” falling within Article
254(2). The important thing to consider with reference to this provision is
whether the legislation is “in respect of the same matter”. If the later
legislation deals not with the matters which http://www.judis.nic.in  114
formed the subject of the earlier legislation but with other and distinct
matters though of a cognate and allied character, then Article 254(2) will
have no application. The principle embodied in Section 107(2) and Article
254(2) is that when there is legislation covering the same ground both by the
Centre and by the Province, both of them being competent to enact the same,
the law of the Centre should prevail over that of the State.
11\. It is true, as already pointed out, that on a question under Article
254(1) whether an Act of Parliament prevails against a law of the State, no
question of repeal arises; but the principle on which the rule of implied
repeal rests, namely, that if the subject- matter of the later legislation is
identical with that of the earlier, so that they cannot both stand together,
then the earlier is repealed by the later enactment, will be equally
applicable to a question under Article 254(2) whether the further legislation
by Parliament is in respect of the same matter as that of the State law. We
must accordingly hold that Section 2 of Bombay Act 36 of 1947 cannot prevail
as against Section 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act 24 of
1946 as amended by Act 52 of 1950.
102\. Similarly, the petitioners placed reliance on T.Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe
and Another reported in (1983) 1 SCC 177, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
at paragraph Nos.15 and 19, observed as under:
"15. There is no doubt or difficulty as to the law applicable.
Article 254 of the Constitution makes provision firstly, as to what would
happen in the case of conflict between a Central and State law with regard to
the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, and secondly, for resolving
such conflict. Article 254(1) enunciates the normal rule that in the event of
a conflict between a Union and a State law in the concurrent field, the former
prevails over the http://www.judis.nic.in  115 latter. Clause (1) lays down
that if a State law relating to a concurrent subject is “repugnant” to a Union
law relating to that subject, then, whether the Union law is prior or later in
time, the Union law will prevail and the State law shall, to the extent of
such repugnancy, be void. To the general rule laid down in Clause (1), Clause
(2) engrafts an exception viz. that if the President assents to a State law
which has been reserved for his consideration, it will prevail notwithstanding
its repugnancy to an earlier law of the Union, both laws dealing with a
concurrent subject. In such a case, the Central Act will give way to the State
Act only to the extent of inconsistency between the two, and no more. In
short, the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a State Act
which is inconsistent with a previous Union law relating to a concurrent
subject would be that the State Act will prevail in that State and override
the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to that State only.
The predominance of the State law may however be taken away if Parliament
legislates under the proviso to Clause (2). The proviso to Article 254(2)
empowers the Union Parliament to repeal or amend a repugnant State law even
though it has become valid by virtue of the President's assent. Parliament may
repeal or amend the repugnant State law, either directly, or by itself
enacting a law repugnant to the State law with respect to the “same matter”.
Even though the subsequent law made by Parliament does not expressly repeal a
State law, even then, the State law will become void as soon as the subsequent
law of Parliament creating repugnancy is made. A State law would be repugnant
to the Union law when there is direct conflict between the two laws. Such
repugnancy may also arise where both laws operate in the same field and the
two cannot possibly stand together, e.g., where both prescribe punishment for
the same offence but the punishment differs in degree or kind or in the
http://www.judis.nic.in  116 procedure prescribed. In all such cases, the law
made by Parliament shall prevail over the State law under Article 254(1). That
being so, when Parliament stepped in and enacted the Central Amendment Act, it
being a later law made by Parliament “with respect to the same matter”, the
West Bengal Amendment Act stood impliedly repealed.
19\. The question that falls for consideration in the appeal is whether a
“contrary intention” appears from the provisions of the Central Amendment Act
so as to exclude the applicability of Section 8 of the Bengal General clauses
Act. Anil Kumar Sen, J. in B Manna case [(1977) 81 Cal WN 1075] , mentions
several reasons why the Central Amendment Act was not really intended to be
retrospective in operation so that it would not cover cases of offences
committed prior to the enactment itself. In the first place, he observes that
the Central Amendment Act had not expressly repealed the West Bengal Amendment
Act nor dealt with the Act or any of its provisions in any manner. It was
enacted with reference and having regard to the provisions of the Act as it
stood before the Central Amendment Act came into force. Even if the Central
Amendment Act had not expressly repealed the West Bengal Amendment Act, it
would still be repealed by necessary implication under the proviso to Article
254(2) as it conflicts with a later law with respect to the same matter
enacted by Parliament".
103\. According to the petitioners, the moment, the new Act, came into force,
all the three State enactments to the extent of repugnancy with the new Land
Acquisition Act, have become void. They would therefore submit that the three
Acts cannot be said to be in force. The learned counsel for the
http://www.judis.nic.in  117 petitioners would state once the three Acts
became void, the same cannot be given life by inserting an amendment in the
new Act and declare that it would apply to the enactments mentioned in the
Fourth Schedule. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, once
the three Acts to the extent of repugnancy have become void, then all the
provisions in the three enactments which are repugnant to the Central
enactment, have been struck down and once these provisions have been struck
down, they cannot be saved by bringing in an amendment by stating that the new
Land Acquisition Act, would not apply to these three enactments for the only
reason that the three State enactments were not in existence at all.
104\. Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy, learned counsel for the petitioner, placed
reliance on a Full Bench judgment of a Delhi High Court in P.L.Mehra vs.
D.R.Khanna reported in AIR 1971 Del 1, wherein the High Court of Delhi
observed as under:
> "80. The contention urged on behalf of the petitioners is that the whole of
> the Principal Act prior to its amendment in 1968 was void. Section 5 and
> Section 7(2) have been declared void by two High Courts. Section 7(1) though
> not formally declared so, was none-the-less void for the same reason. The
> remaining provisions of the Act were merely incidental and were intended to
> subserve and/or effectuate the proceedings for the recovery of rent, damages
> and possession which were instituted under Sections 7(1), 7(2) and 5. These
> other provisions could not separately exist http://www.judis.nic.in  118 as
> their existence depended on Sections 7(1), 7(2) and 5 which constituted the
> core of the Act and were its only raison d'etre. Without these provisions
> Parliament would not have enacted the other provisions at all. The Whole Act

> amendment of a void Act which was dead the moment it was born and therefore
> non- existent, was ineffective. The proceedings for eviction of the
> petitioners could not, therefore, be taken even under the Amended Act.
94\. My learned brother is of the view that when it is said that a void
statute is a dead statute, it is merely a figure of speech which is being
taken to be a reality. What is really meant by the expression is that a
statute which is void within the meaning of Article 13(2) of the Constitution
is 'ineffectual, nugatory and without legal force or binding effect' and the
Courts will not enforce it in deciding rights of the parties. But such a
statute very much exist on the statute book and Parliament is bound to take
notice of it for further legislation to repeal or amend it. This indeed
appears to be the major premise for the view taken by my learned brother who
also finds support for his view in the following passage in the judgment in
Mahendra Lal Jaini's case, . It was there said: "The meaning of the word
'void' for all practical purposes is the same in Article 13(1) as in Article
13(2) namely, that the laws which were void were ineffectual and nugatory and
avoid of any legal force or binding effect. But the pre-Constitution laws
could not become void form their inception on account of the application of
Article 13(1). The meaning of the word 'void' in Article 13(2) is also the
http://www.judis.nic.in  119 same viz., that the laws are ineffectual and
nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect, if they contravene
Article 13(2)."
Although my learned brother has quoted from the judgment the sentence
following the above passage, he does not seem to be willing to concede the
full implications of the statement of law laid down therein. It was there
said: "But there is one vital difference between pre-Constitution and post-
Constitution laws in this matter. The voidness of the pre-Constitution laws is
not from inception. Such voidness supervened when the Constitution came into
force; and so they existed and operated for some time and for certain
purposes; the voidness of post-Constitution laws is from their very inception
and they cannot therefore continue to exist for any purpose."
96\. According to my learned brother, the decision in Mahendra Lal Jaini's
case "confirms the view that the statute itself continues to exist on the
statute book but has become ineffectual, nugatory and devoid of any legal
force or binding effect.
The thrust of these words is that such a law cannot be given effect to by the
Courts in deciding upon the rights of the parties. these words are significant
only for the purposes of the Courts vis-a-vis the rights of the parties. they
would be meaningless if applied to the power of the legislature to re-enact,
repeal or amend a statute."
My learned brother is also of the opinion that "the continuance of existence
of a statute" is synonymous with "its operativeness or enforceability" and is
different from "continuance of its existence on the statute book."
97\. I find it exceedingly difficult to put faith in the continued existence
of a statute which the Supreme Court says was 'dead' or 'still-born' when it
was enacted. The concept of a dead statute being still in 'existence for the
purpose of amendment reminds me of the http://www.judis.nic.in  120
metaphysical concept of 'non-existence' being regarded as a form of
'existence'. I am also unable to share my learned brother's interpretation of
what has held in Mahendra Lal Jaini's case, . That decision in no way supports
the view taken by him and is entirely against it.
103\. It is true that a decision of the Supreme Court, much less a decision of
any other Court, much less a decision of any other Court, holding a statute to
be void does not repeal the statute and that it is only a legislature having
requisite competence which can repeal a statute. But that is by no means the
entire statement of law on the point. What the Court does when it holds a
statute to be void under Article 13(2) is to declare that such a statute had
not been enacted at all. It existed neither in the past nor shall it exist in
future. Having been born dead there is nothing except its reversal that can
revitalise it. The activities of the two organs of State, namely, the
legislature and the Courts, though complementary and in no way antagonistic to
each other, have their own allotted functions. The function of the legislature
is to enact, amend or repeal a statute. The courts, especially the Supreme
Court and the High Courts, do not have any such function. They only test the
statute enacted, amended or repealed by the legislature in the light of the
organic law of the land, namely, the Constitution, and if they find that the
statute enacted after coming into force of the Constitution, contravenes Part
Iii of the Constitution or any other Constitutional provision which limits the
power of the Legislature, they simply say that the statute should be held
never to have been enacted at all. It neither was nor shall it be.
104\. It would also not be correct to say that the voidness of a statute under
Art. 13 is the result of a judicial decision. If a statute
http://www.judis.nic.in  121 contravenes the provisions of the Constitution it
is void because the Constitution says so. A statute is either void or not
void. A Court only adjudges whether it is so in terms of the Constitution.
Legislature only repeals a statute which is in existence. it is correct that
no statute can go out of existence unless the legislature repeals it; but vis-
a-vas a statute which is void ab initio it is begging the question to say that
it remains on the statute-book till it is repealed.
105\. In that view of the matter I fail to understand what difference it would
make to the statute still remaining physically on the "statute-book", a
circumstance which appears to have registered such a profound impression on
the mind of my learned brother it cannot be denied that even in the case of a
statute which is repealed by the legislature it is only in subsequent editions
that the repealed statute is not printed. it may be that once a statute is
repealed, a red line is drawn across it in the statute-book to show that it is
not longer there. The same result will follow or at any rate, should follow,
when a statute is declared void by the Supreme Court for a note can certainly
be made to identify such a statute from others with respect to which no such
declaration has been made".
105\. A perusal of the above-mentioned judgments, especially the last
paragraph quoted above, the Delhi High Court, has taken a view that the once a
statute is declared ultra vires, or repealed, or even for that matter
repugnant under Article 254, it is as if a red line is drawn across the
statute book to show that it is no longer there. If this is so, then the
question is that, whether can it be saved? It is argued by the learned counsel
for the petitioner that once the statute has been declared as void, it cannot
be http://www.judis.nic.in  122 saved by the State Government by inserting it
in the fifth Schedule because according to him, only when a legislature is
valid, it could be saved by inserting into the Fifth Schedule. According to
Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy, learned counsel, the fact that the Central Act saved
the 13 Central Acts by inserting it into the Fourth schedule cannot help the
State Government to adopt the same procedure, because the Central Acts had
become void after the commencement of the new Land Acquisition Act. Article
254(2) applies only when there is a conflict between the State enactment and a
Central enactment, in matters which are enumerated in List 3 of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India. It does not apply to legislations made
by Parliament. According to the learned counsel, therefore, what was open to
the Central Act under 105 cannot be made applicable to the State Acts by
inserting 105-A in the light of Article 254.
106\. Learned counsel for the petitioners would further contend that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in PT. Rishikesh and Another vs. Salma Begum (Smt)
reported in (1995) 4 SCC 718 at Paragraph Nos.20 and 21, which reads as under:
> "20. The contention of the learned counsel proceeded on the assertion that
> the Central Act is a Consolidation Act intended to repeal Act 5 of 1908 and
> re-enact Act 104 of 1976 to be a complete code is misconceived. The title of

The ratio therein must be understood in the light of the facts therein. Rule
72 of Order 21 CPC was amended by the State http://www.judis.nic.in  124
Legislature, equally the Central Act repealed the existing rule and re-enacted
the rule so as to be self-operative and complete code consistent with the
development of the law. Therefore, the Bench held that State Amendment since
was not consistent with the Central Act, the State Amendment was declared
repugnant to the Central Act. Therefore, it became void unless it was re-
enacted by the State Legislature, reserved for consideration and received the
assent of the President. The ratio on the facts in that case is
unexceptionable but observations which we have noted above, gave rise to a
construction advanced by the counsel. The wide construction put up by the
Bench with due respect does not appear to be sound. It is seen that Order 15
of the Central Act, as it stood before to the Amendment Act, consists of only
Rules 1 to
4\. Since the special need arose in Uttar Pradesh to maintain equilibrium
between the rights of the tenants of their fixity of tenures subject to
compliance with the provisions of the Rent Act and of the landlord to receive
rent from the tenant, even pending proceedings, enacted Rule 5 and received
the assent of the President and became a statute. Three Explanations were made
by U.P. Act 57 of 1976 to remove ambiguities and doubts. As stated earlier,
the Central Act being an Amending Act and not a repealing Act and only Rule 2
of Order 15 was amended by the Central Act and the State Act made no amendment
to Order 15, Rule 2. Rule 5 as was pre-existing was not dealt with in the
Central Act. On the other hand, Section 35-B of the Code empowers the Court to
strike down the defence if costs are not paid as directed by the Court.
Equally, Order 6, Rule 16 empowers the Court to strike down the pleading on
conditions mentioned in the said rule. Order 11, Rule 21 empowers the Court to
strike down the defence in case the party fails to comply with any order to
answer interrogatories for discovery or inspection of the documents. The Code,
thus, by itself envisages striking off the defencein the stated circumstances.
Similar provision made by the State Legislature is also consistent with the
policy and principles of Act 5 of 1908 as amended by the Central Act. In other
words, there is no repugnancy in that behalf.
21\. The condition precedent to bring about repugnancy should be that there
must be an amendment made to the principal Act under the Central Act and the
previous amendment made by a State Legislature or a provision made by a High
Court must occupy the same field and operate in a collision course. Since the
State Act as incorporated by Act 37 of 1972 and the Explanations to Rule 5 by
Act 57 of 1976, Rule 5 was not occupied by the Central Act in relation to the
State of U.P., they remain to be a valid law. We may clarify at once that if
the http://www.judis.nic.in  125 Central law and the State law or a provision
made by the High Court occupy the same field and operate in collision course,
the State Act or the provision made in the Order by a High Court being
inconsistent with or in other words being incompatible with the Central Act,
it becomes void unless it is re-enacted, reserved for consideration and
receives the assent of the President after the Central Act was made by
Parliament i.e. 10-9-1976.
107\. According to the learned counsel, the only way to resurrect a State
enactment which has become void is to get it re-enacted and then send it to
the President for assent.
108\. On the other hand, the learned Advocate General has contended that sub
section (1)(3) of Section 105-A of Act 1/2015 states that the amendment shall
deem to have come into force on 1.1.2014 on the date when the new Land
Acquisition Act came into force. Therefore, according to him, the State Acts
never have been rendered as void. According to him on 1.1.2014 simultaneously
the State Acts were kept in the 4th schedule of the new Land Acquisition Act.
According to the learned Advocate General since the Amendment Act has received
the assent of the President. Article 254(2) would be attracted and these three
State enactments cannot be declared as void and they will prevail over the new
Land Acquisition Act in the State of Tamil Nadu. The learned Advocate General
will place reliance on the apt-
quoted judgment of Lord Asquith in the celebrated judgment of East End
Dwellings Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council reported in 1952 AC 109 :
(1951) 2 All ER 587, wherein Lord Asquith has observed as under.
http://www.judis.nic.in  126 "If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of
affairs as real, you must also imagine as real the consequences and incidents
which, if the putative state of affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably
have flowed from or accompanied it; and if the statute says that you must
imagine a certain state of affairs, it cannot be interpreted to mean that
having done so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle when it
comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs."
109\. According to the learned Advocate General, this principle has been
followed in a number of judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
According to him, there is no question of any repugnancy. He would also state
that a reading of Section 105-A would show that the compensation under the
three State enactments would be the same in respect of the three State
enactments and that the compensation would never be reduced. He would also
state that the three State enactments will also not dilute the provisions
regarding rehabilitation and resettlement as was specified in the
Notification. According to the learned Advocate General the fact that the
Amendment Act had received the assent of the President on 1.1.2015 does not
have any impact as the State Act cannot be held to be repugnant to the Central
enactment because of the deeming provision in the Amendment Act which deems
that the amendment has come into force on 1.1.2014, on which date, the new
Land Acquisition Act came into force.
110\. Mr.Suhirth Parthasarathy would state that the argument of the learned
Advocate General cannot be accepted because even though the new
http://www.judis.nic.in  127 Land Acquisition Act came into force on 1.1.2014,
it received the assent of the President on 27.9.2013 and was published in Part
II Section 1 of the Gazette India Extraordinary Issue No.40 dated 27.9.2014.
According to him, repugnancy kicks when the moment the law is made and not
when the law comes into force. According to him since the Law was made on
27.9.2013, the three State enactments to the extent of repugnancy to the new
Land Acquisition Act had seized to have any force on that day itself. It was
struck of the statute books on 27.9.2013 itself and therefore the deeming
provision as argued by the State Government would not have any effect. A
perusal of Articles 254(1) and 254(2) brings out the following:
> (i) Repugnancy under Article 254 arises only if both the parliamentary law
> and the state law are referrable to List 3 of the 7th schedule of the
> Constitution.
> (ii) In order to determine whether the parliamentary law is also referable
> to the concurrent list and whether the State Law is also referable to the
> concurrent list, the doctrine of pith and substance must be applied.
111\. Applying the above principles, it is clear that both Parliament and the
State Legislature are competent to enact these laws. The three State
enactments received the assent of the President on 21.7.1978, 25.5.1999 and
16.9.2002 respectively and therefore, prevailed in the State of Tamil Nadu
even when the Old Act, 1894 covered the entire field. Contention of the
petitioner is that when the new Act came into force, the three state
enactments have become void. In order to save the acquisitions made under
http://www.judis.nic.in  128 the three State enactments, the State of Tamil
Nadu brought out an amendment to the Central Act by inserting Section 105-A in
order to save the acquisitions made under the three State enactments from
1.1.2014 to the insertion of 105-A. The State Government also brought out
three Government Orders dated 31.12.2014, clearly mentioning that the
acquisitions made under the three State enactments would be saved by amendment
to the new Land Acquisition Act and for this purpose the amending Act even
though received the assent of the President on 1.1.2015 was deemed to have
come into force on 1.1.2014. Article 254 kicks in when there is repugnancy in
any provision of the law made by the Legislature of the State to any provision
of law made by the Parliament which the Parliament is competent to
enact.Therefore, these state enactments are rendered void, the moment the New
Act was “made.” i.e. when it received the presidential assent, as on
27.09.2013.
112\. The only protection in this sense offered to law made by the States in
case of repugnancy is under Article 254(2). Importantly, the repugnancy is
noted only in respect of an earlier law laid down by the Parliament. The
provisions of Article 254(2) would not apply in the case of a law already made
by the State, which has become repugnant as a result of a new enactment of
Parliament. Article 254(2) does not offer any protection to laws made by
States before the Central Legislation, which leads them to be
http://www.judis.nic.in  129 repugnant,comes into force. It requires the
entire repugnant law to be reserved for the consideration of the President,
afresh, and the President must give his consent to the entire law. This law
which otherwise would be repugnant, is then specifically saved. These laws
must receive his assent in the present sense. Thus, in order to bring any act
within the purview of Article 254(2) it must necessarily be re-enacted, and
reconsidered by the President afresh. Merely inserting Section 105A in the New
Act, shall not fulfil the requirements of Article 254(2), and the laws would
remain repugnant.
113\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Kerala and others vs.
Mar AppraemKuri Company Limited and Another reported in (2012) 7 SCC 106,
considered the following question:
> Whether Kerala Chitties Act 23 of 1975 became repugnant to the (Central)
> Chit Funds Act 40 of 1982 under Article 254(1) upon making of the (Central)
> Chit Funds Act 40 of 1982 (i.e. on 19-8- 1982 when the President gave his
> assent) or whether the Kerala Chitties Act 23 of 1975 would become repugnant
> to the (Central) Chit Funds Act 40 of 1982 as and when the notification
> under Section 1(3) of the (Central) Chit Funds Act 40 of 1982 bringing the
> Central Act into force in the State of Kerala is issued?
114\. While answering the issue as to at what time the State Act becomes
repugnant to the Central Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
http://www.judis.nic.in  130 clearly stated the State Act becomes repugnant to
the Central Act the moment the President gives assent to the Central Act. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case has observed as under:
> "34. Article 254 deals with inconsistency between laws made by Parliament
> and laws made by the legislatures of States. It finds place in Part XI of
> the Constitution. Part XI deals with relations between the Union and the
> States. Part XI consists of two chapters. Chapter I deals with Distribution
> of Legislative Powers. Articles 245 to 255 find place in Chapter I of Part
> XI.
> 35\. Article 245 deals with extent of laws made by Parliament and by the

> Head Note to Article 245. The verb “make”, in the present tense, exists in
> Article 245(1) whereas the verb “made”, in the past tense, finds place in

> Legislatures.
> 36\. Article 246 deals with the subject-matter of laws made by Parliament

> List III. (See SubrahmanyanChettiar v. MuttuswamiGoundan [AIR 1941 FC 47 :
> (1940) 2 FCR 188] .)
> 37\. Article 246, thus, provides for distribution, as between Union and the
> States, of the legislative powers which are conferred by Article 245.
> Article 245 begins with the expression “subject to the provisions of this
> Constitution”. Therefore, Article 246 must be read as “subject to other
> provisions of the Constitution”.
38\. For the purposes of this decision, the point which needs to be emphasised
is that Article 245 deals with conferment of legislative powers whereas
Article 246 provides for distribution of the legislative powers. Article 245
deals with extent of laws whereas Article 246 deals with distribution of
legislative powers. In these articles, the Constitution Framers have used the
word “make” and not “commencement” which has a specific legal
http://www.judis.nic.in  131 connotation. [See Section 3(13) of the General
Clauses Act, 1897.]
39\. One more aspect needs to be highlighted. Article 246(1) begins with a non
obstante clause “Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3)”. These words
indicate the principle of federal supremacy, namely, in case of inevitable
conflict between the Union and State powers, the Union powers, as enumerated
in List I, shall prevail over the State powers, as enumerated in Lists II and
III, and in case of overlapping between Lists III and II, the former shall
prevail. (See Indu Bhushan Bose v. Rama Sundari Devi [(1969) 2 SCC 289 :
(1970) 1 SCR 443] , SCR at p. 454.)
40\. However, the principle of federal supremacy in Article 246(1) cannot be
resorted to unless there is an “irreconcilable” conflict between the entries
in the Union and State Lists. The said conflict has to be a “real” conflict.
The non obstante clause in Article 246(1) operates only if reconciliation is
impossible. As stated, the parliamentary legislation has supremacy as provided
in Articles 246(1) and (2). This is of relevance when the field of legislation
is in the Concurrent List. The Union and the State Legislatures have
concurrent power with respect to the subjects enumerated in List III. [See
Article 246(2).] Hence, the State Legislature has full power to legislate
regarding subjects in the Concurrent List, subject to Article 254(2) i.e.
provided the provisions of the State Act do not come in conflict with those of
the Central Act on the subject. [See Amalgamated Electricity Co. (Belgaum)
Ltd. v. Municipal Committee, Ajmer [AIR 1969 SC 227 : (1969) 1 SCR 430] .]
Thus, the expression “subject to” in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246
denotes supremacy of Parliament.
41\. Further, in Article 246(1) the expression used is “with respect to”.
There is a distinction between a law “with respect to” and a law “affecting” a
subject-matter. The opening words of Article 245 “Subject to the provisions of
this Constitution” make the legislative power conferred by Article 245 and
Article 246, as well as the legislative Lists, “subject to the provisions of
the Constitution”. Consequently, laws made by a legislature may be void not
only for lack of legislative powers in respect of the subject-matter, but also
for transgressing constitutional limitations. (See Para 22.6 of Vol. 3 at p.
2305 of the Constitutional Law of India by H.M. Seervai, 4th Edn.) This aspect
is important as the word “void” finds place in Article 254(1) of the
Constitution. Therefore, the Union and State Legislature have concurrent power
with respect to subjects enumerated in List III. Hence, the State Legislature
has full power to legislate regarding the subjects in List III, subject to the
provision in Article 254(2) i.e. provided the provisions of the State Act do
not conflict with those of the Central Act on the subject. Where Parliament
has made no law occupying the field in List III, the State Legislature is
competent to legislate in that field. As stated, the expression “subject to”
in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246 denotes the supremacy of Parliament.
Thus, Parliament and the State Legislature derive the power to legislate on a
subject in List I and List II from Articles 246(1) and (3) respectively. Both
derive their power from Article 246(2) to legislate upon a matter in List III
subject to Article 254 of the Constitution. The respective Lists merely
http://www.judis.nic.in  132 demarcate the legislative fields or legislative
heads.
42\. Further, Article 250 and Article 251 also use the word “make” and not
“commencement”. If one reads the Head Note to Article 250 it refers to power
of Parliament to legislate with respect to any matter in the State List if a
Proclamation of Emergency is in operation. The word “made” also finds place in
Article 250(2). In other words, the verb “make” or the verb “made” is
equivalent to the expression “to legislate”. Thus, making of the law is to
legislate with respect to any matter in the State List if Proclamation of
Emergency is in operation. The importance of this discussion is to show that
the Constitution Framers have deliberately used the word “made” or “make” in
the above articles.
43\. Our Constitution gives supremacy to Parliament in the matter of making of
the laws or legislating with respect to matters delineated in the three Lists.
The principle of supremacy of Parliament, the distribution of legislative
powers, the principle of exhaustive enumeration of matters in the three Lists
are all to be seen in the context of making of laws and not in the context of
commencement of the laws.
44\. Under clause (1) of Article 254, a general rule is laid down to say that
the Union law shall prevail where the State law is repugnant to it. The
question of repugnancy arises only with respect to the subjects enumerated in
the Concurrent List as both Parliament and the State Legislatures have
concurrent powers to legislate over the subject-matter in that List. In such
cases, at times, conflict arises.
45\. Clause (1) of Article 254 states that if a State law relating to a
concurrent subject is “repugnant” to a Union law relating to that subject,
then, whether the Union law is prior or later in time, the Union law will
prevail and the State law shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, be void.
Thus, Article 254(1) also gives supremacy to the law made by Parliament, which
Parliament is competent to enact. In case of repugnancy, the State legislation
would be void only to the extent of repugnancy. If there is no repugnancy
between the two laws, there is no question of application of Article 254(1)
and both the Acts would prevail. Thus, Article 254 is attracted only when
legislations covering the same matter in List III made by the Centre and by
the State operate on that subject; both of them (Parliament and the State
Legislatures) being competent to enact laws with respect to the subject in
List III.
46\. In the present case, Schedule VII List III Entry 7 deals with the subject
of “Contracts”. It also covers special contracts. Chitties are special
contracts. Thus, Parliament and the State Legislatures are competent to enact
a law with respect to such contracts.
47\. The question of repugnancy between parliamentary legislation and State
legislation arises in two ways. First, where the legislations, though enacted
with respect to matters in their allotted spheres, overlap and conflict.
Second, where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the
Concurrent List and there is a conflict. In both the situations, the
parliamentary legislation will predominate, in the first, by virtue of non
http://www.judis.nic.in  133 obstante clause in Article 246(1); in the second,
by reason of Article 254(1).
48\. Article 254(2) deals with a situation where the State legislation having
been reserved and having obtained the President's assent, prevails in that
State; this again is subject to the proviso that Parliament can again bring a
legislation to override even such State legislation.
49\. In clause (1) of Article 254 the significant words used are “provision of
a law made by the legislature of a State”, “any provision of a law made by
Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact”, “the law made by
Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of
such State”, and “the law made by the legislature of the State shall, to the
extent of repugnancy, be void”. Again, clause (2) of Article 254 speaks of “a
law made by the legislature of a State”, “an earlier law made by Parliament”,
and “the law so made by the legislature of such State”. Thus, it is noticeable
that throughout Article 254 the emphasis is on law-making by the respective
legislatures.
50\. Broadly speaking, law-making is exclusively the function of the
legislatures (see Articles 79 and 168). The President and the Governor are a
part of the Union or the legislatures of the States. As far as Parliament is
concerned, the legislative process is complete as soon as the procedure
prescribed by Article 107 of the Constitution and connected provisions are
followed and the Bill passed by both the Houses of Parliament has received the
assent of the President under Article 111. Similarly, a State legislation
becomes an Act as soon as a Bill has been passed by the State Legislature and
it has received the assent of the Governor in accordance with Article
200\. It is only in the situation contemplated by Article 254(2) that a State
legislation is required to be reserved for consideration and assent by the
President. Thus, irrespective of the date of enforcement of a parliamentary or
State enactment, a Bill becomes an Act and comes on the statute book
immediately on receiving the assent of the President or the Governor, as the
case may be, which assent has got to be published in the Official Gazette.
51\. The legislature, in exercise of its legislative power, may either enforce
an Act, which has been passed and which has received the assent of the
President or the Governor, as the case may be, from a specified date or leave
it to some designated authority to fix a date for its enforcement. Such
legislations are conditional legislations as in such cases no part of the
legislative function is left unexercised. In such legislations, merely because
the legislature has postponed the enforcement of the Act, it does not mean
that the law has not been made.
52\. In the present case, the (Central) Chit Funds Act, 1982 is a law made.
The Chit Funds Bill was passed by both the Houses of Parliament and received
the assent of the President on 19-8-1982. It came on the statute book as the
Chit Funds Act, 1982 (40 of 1982). Section 1(2) of the said Act states that
the Act extends to the whole of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir
whereas Section 1(3) states that:
“1. (3) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may,
by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint, and http://www.judis.nic.in
134 different dates may be appointed for different States.” The point to be
noted is that the law-making process ended on 19-8-1982. Section 1(3) is a
piece of conditional legislation. As stated, in legislations of such
character, merely because the legislation has postponed the enforcement of the
Act, it does not mean that the law has not been made.
53\. In the present case, after enactment of the Chit Funds Act, 1982 on
19-8-1982, the said Act has been applied to 17 States by the notifications
issued from time to time under Section 1(3). How could Section 1(3) operate
and make the said Act applicable to 17 States between 2-4-1984 and 15-9- 2008
and/or postpone the commencement of the Act for certain other States including
the States of Kerala, Gujarat, Haryana, etc. unless that section itself is in
force?
54\. To put the matter in another way, if the entire Act including Section
1(3) was not in operation on 19-8-1982, how could the Central Government issue
any notification under that very section in respect of 17 States? There must
be a law authorising the Government to bring the Act into force. Thus, Section
1(3) came into force immediately on the passing of the Act (see A. Thangal
Kunju Musaliar v. M. Venkatachalam Potti [AIR 1956 SC 246 : (1955) 2 SCR 1196]
). Thus, the material dates, in our opinion, are the dates when the two
enactments received the assent of the President which in the case of Central
Act is 19-8-1982 while in the case of the Kerala Chitties Act, 1975, it is
18-7-1975.
55\. There is one more way in which this problem can be approached. Both the
courts below have proceeded on the basis that there are conflicting provisions
in the Central Act, 1982 vis-à-vis the State Act, 1975 (see paras 13, 14 and
15 of the impugned judgment). In our view, the intention of Parliament was
clearly to occupy the entire field falling in Entry 7 of List III. The 1982
Act was enacted as a Central legislation to “ensure uniformity in the
provisions applicable to chit fund institutions throughout the country as such
a Central legislation would prevent such institutions from taking advantage
either of the absence of any law governing chit funds in a State or exploit
the benefit of any lacuna or relaxation in any State law by extending their
activities in such States”.
56\. The background of the enactment of the (Central) Chit Funds Act, which
refers to the report of the Banking Commission has been exhaustively dealt
with in Shriram Chits and Investment (P) Ltd. v. Union of India [1993 Supp (4)
SCC 226] as also in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1982 Act. The
clear intention of enacting the Central 1982 Act, therefore, was to make the
Central Act a complete code with regard to the business of conducting chit
funds and to occupy the legislative field relating to such chit funds.
57\. Moreover, the intention to override the State laws is clearly manifested
in the Central Act, especially Section 3 which makes it clear that the
provisions of the Central Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force.
http://www.judis.nic.in  135 Similarly, Section 90 of the Central Act
providing for the repeal of State legislations also manifests the intention on
the part of Parliament to occupy the field hitherto occupied by State
legislation.
58\. Each and every aspect relating to the conduct of the chits as is covered
by the State Act has been touched upon by the Central Act in a more
comprehensive manner. Thus, on 19-8-1982, Parliament in enacting the Central
law has manifested its intention not only to override the existing State laws,
but to occupy the entire field relating to chits, which is a special contract,
coming under Entry 7 of List III. Consequently, the State Legislature was
divested of its legislative power/authority to enact Section 4(1)(a) vide the
Kerala Finance Act 7 of 2002 on 29-7-2002, save and except under Article
254(2) of the Constitution. Thus, Section 4(1)(a) became void for want of
assent of the President under Article 254(2).
59\. Let us assume for the sake of argument that the State of Kerala were to
obtain the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution in
respect of the insertion of Section 4(1)(a) by the Kerala Finance Act 7 of
2002. Now, Article 254(2) deals with the situation where State legislation is
reserved and having obtained the President's assent, prevails in the State
over the Central law. However, in view of the proviso to Article 254(2),
Parliament could have brought a legislation even to override such assented-to
State Finance Act 7 of 2002 without waiting for the Kerala Finance Act 7 of
2002 to be brought into force as the said proviso states that nothing in
Article 254(2) shall prevent Parliament from enactingat any time, any law with
respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or
repealing the law so made by the State Legislature [emphasis supplied].
60\. Thus, Parliament in the matter of enacting such an overriding law need
not wait for the earlier State Finance Act 7 of 2002 to be brought into force.
In other words, Parliament has the power under the said proviso to override
the Kerala Finance Act 7 of 2002 even before it is brought into force.
Therefore, we see no justification for construing Article 254(2) read with the
proviso in a manner which inhibits Parliament from repealing, amending, or
varying a State legislation which has received the President's assent under
Article 254(2), till that State legislation is brought into force. We have to
read the word “made” in the proviso to Article 254(2) in a consistent manner.
61\. The entire above discussion on Articles 245, 246, 250, 251 is only to
indicate that the word “made” has to be read in the context of the law- making
process and, if so read, it is clear that to test repugnancy one has to go by
the making of law and not by its commencement.
62\. In T. Barai v. Henry Ah Hoe [(1983) 1 SCC 177 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 143] this
Court has laid down the following principles on repugnancy: (SCC pp. 186-87,
para 15) “15. There is no doubt or difficulty as to the law applicable.
Article 254 of the Constitution makes provision firstly, as to what would
happen in the case of conflict between a Central and State law with regard to
the subjects http://www.judis.nic.in  136 enumerated in the Concurrent List,
and secondly, for resolving such conflict. Article 254(1) enunciates the
normal rule that in the event of a conflict between a Union and a State law in
the concurrent field, the former prevails over the latter. Clause (1) lays
down that if a State law relating to a concurrent subject is ‘repugnant’ to a
Union law relating to that subject, then, whether the Union law is prior or
later in time, the Union law will prevail and the State law shall, to the
extent of such repugnancy, be void. To the general rule laid down in clause
(1), clause (2) engrafts an exception viz. that if the President assents to a
State law which has been reserved for his consideration, it will prevail
notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law of the Union, both laws
dealing with a concurrent subject. In such a case, the Central Act will give
way to the State Act only to the extent of inconsistency between the two, and
no more. In short, the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a
State Act which is inconsistent with a previous Union law relating to a
concurrent subject would be that the State Act will prevail in that State and
override the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to that
State only. The predominance of the State law may however be taken away if
Parliament legislates under the proviso to clause (2). The proviso to Article
254(2) empowers the Union Parliament to repeal or amend a repugnant State law
even though it has become valid by virtue of the President's assent.
Parliament may repeal or amend the repugnant State law, either directly, or by
itself enacting a law repugnant to the State law with respect to the ‘same
matter’. Even though the subsequent law made by Parliament does not expressly
repeal a State law, even then, the State law will become void as soon as the
subsequent law of Parliament creating repugnancy is made. A State law would be
repugnant to the Union law when there is direct conflict between the two laws.
Such repugnancy may also arise where both laws operate in the same field and
the two cannot possibly stand together e.g. where both prescribe punishment
for the same offence but the punishment differs in degree or kind or in the
procedure prescribed. In all such cases, the law made by Parliament shall
prevail over the State law under Article 254(1).” (emphasis supplied)
63\. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka [1985 Supp SCC 476] this Court vide
para 18 stated as under: (SCC p. 496) “18. Thus, in my opinion, the five
principles have to be read and construed together and not in isolation—where
however, the Central and the State legislation cover the same field then the
Central legislation would prevail. It is also well settled that where two
Acts, one passed by Parliament and the other by a State Legislature, collide
and there is no question of harmonising them, then the Central legislation
must prevail.” (emphasis supplied)
64\. In M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India [(1979) 3 SCC 431 : 1979 SCC (Cri)
691] , the test for determining repugnancy has been laid down by the Supreme
Court as under: (SCC pp. 436-38, 444 & 448-49, paras 8, 24-25 &
http://www.judis.nic.in  137
35) “8. It would be seen that so far as clause (1) of Article 254 is concerned
it clearly lays down that where there is a direct collision between a
provision of a law made by the State and that made by Parliament with respect
to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the
provisions of clause (2), the State law would be void to the extent of the
repugnancy. This naturally means that where both the State Legislature and
Parliament occupy the field contemplated by the Concurrent List then the Act
passed by Parliament being prior in point of time will prevail and
consequently the State Act will have to yield to the Central Act. In fact, the
scheme of the Constitution is a scientific and equitable distribution of
legislative powers between Parliament and the State Legislatures. First,
regarding the matters contained in List I i.e. the Union List to the Seventh
Schedule, Parliament alone is empowered to legislate and the State
Legislatures have no authority to make any law in respect of the Entries
contained in List I. Secondly, so far as the Concurrent List is concerned,
both Parliament and the State Legislatures are entitled to legislate in regard
to any of the Entries appearing therein, but that is subject to the condition
laid down by Article 254(1) discussed above. Thirdly, so far as the matters in
List II i.e. the State List are concerned, the State Legislatures alone are
competent to legislate on them and only under certain conditions Parliament
can do so. It is, therefore, obvious that in such matters repugnancy may
result from the following circumstances:
(1) Where the provisions of a Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent
List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable, the Central Act
will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy.
(2) Where however a law passed by the State Legislature comes into collision
with a law passed by Parliament on an Entry in the Concurrent List, the State
Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the
Central Act would become void provided the State Act has been passed in
accordance with clause (2) of Article 254.
(3) Where a law passed by the State Legislature while being substantially
within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the
Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by
invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the
provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the
four corners of the State List and entrenchment, if any, is purely incidental
or inconsequential.
(4) Where, however, a law made by the State Legislature on a subject covered
by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law
made by Parliament, then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent
of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution. The result of
obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the State Act is
concerned, it will prevail in the State and overrule the provisions
http://www.judis.nic.in  138 of the Central Act in their applicability to that
State only. Such a state of affairs will exist only until Parliament may at
any time make a law adding to, or amending, varying or repealing the law made
by the State Legislature under the proviso to Article 254.
So far as the present State Act is concerned we are called upon to consider
the various shades of the constitutional validity of the same under Article
254(2) of the Constitution.
***
24\. It is well settled that the presumption is always in favour of the
constitutionality of a statute and the onus lies on the person assailing the
Act to prove that it is unconstitutional. Prima facie, there does not appear
to us to be any inconsistency between the State Act and the Central Acts.
Before any repugnancy can arise, the following conditions must be satisfied:
(1) That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and
the State Act.
(2) That such an inconsistency is absolutely irreconcilable. (3) That the
inconsistency between the provisions of the two Acts is of such a nature as to
bring the two Acts into direct collision with each other and a situation is
reached where it is impossible to obey the one without disobeying the other.
25\. In Colin Howard's Australian Federal Constitutional Law, 2nd Edn., the
author while describing the nature of inconsistency between the two enactments
observed as follows:
‘An obvious inconsistency arises when the two enactments produce different
legal results when applied to the same facts.’ ***
35\. On a careful consideration, therefore, of the authorities referred to
above, the following propositions emerge:
(1) That in order to decide the question of repugnancy it must be shown that
the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions, so that
they cannot stand together or operate in the same field.
(2) That there can be no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency
appears on the face of the two statutes.
(3) That where the two statutes occupy a particular field, but there is room
or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming
into collision with each other, no repugnancy results.
(4) That where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same
field seeks to create distinct and separate offences, no question of
repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same
field.” (emphasis supplied)
65\. Applying the above tests to the facts of the present case, on the
enactment of the (Central) Chit Funds Act, 1982 on 19-8-1982, intending to
http://www.judis.nic.in  139 occupy the entire field of chits under Entry 7 of
List III, the State Legislature was denuded of its power to enact the Kerala
Finance Act 7 of 2002. However, as held in numerous decisions of this Court, a
law enacted by the State Legislature on a topic in the Concurrent List which
is inconsistent with and repugnant to the law made by Parliament can be
protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article 254(2) and
that the said assent would enable the State law to prevail in the State and
override the provisions of the Central Act in its applicability to that State
only.
115\. Since the President has given the assent to the New Act on 27.9.2013,
all the three State Acts had become repugnant to the Central enactment. They
had therefore become void on 27.9.2013. By introducing Section 105-A and
putting the three Acts which had become void, in the fifth schedule would not
resurrect the Acts which had become void and a dead letter as observed in
PT.Rishikesh vs. Salma Begum (Smt.) reported in (1995) 4 SCC 718, the only way
by which the Acts could have been given life so as to re-enact them, get fresh
assent from the President of India, so as to attract Article 254(2) of the
Constitution of India, for it to be applicable in the State of Tamil Nadu. The
deeming fiction as argued by the learned Advocate General would not apply in
this case because the deeming fiction only goes back up to 1.1.2014 i.e. the
date on which the new Land Acquisition Act becomes operative. The three State
Enactments have already become void on the date on which the new Act become
operative and therefore, even if the deeming fiction the fullest effect, it
would still not revive the three State enactments, which had become void on
27.9.2013.
http://www.judis.nic.in  140
116\. Reliance of Mr. Arvindh Pandian on the Judgement of the Supreme Court in
the case of Jagannath v. Authorised Officer, Land Reforms (supra) is
misplaced. It is important to note that the observations relied upon by Mr.
Arvindh Pandian were in the context of a law becoming void, because it
violated part III of the Constitution of India, and were not in respect of
laws becoming repugnant because of the operation of Article 254(1). The case
law relied upon will have no bearing on the facts of the present case.
117\. It must also be noted that the analogy of Section 105 cannot be extended
to 105-A. Section 105 applies only to Central enactments. Article 254 applies
only in case of repugnancy between the Central enactment and a State
enactment, regarding a subject covered under the List 3 in the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution of India. Section 105 only enumerates the Central
enactment to which the provision of the Land Acquisition Act does not apply.
Section 105-A, which has been inserted by an amendment, namely Tamil Nadu Act
1 of 2015, is an attempt by the State to save the three State enactments,
which became void on 1.1.2014, the date on which the Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 2015
was to come into force. The three State enactments, therefore, cannot be said
to be operative in the State of Tamil Nadu by virtue of Section 105-A, and
were null and void as on the date on which the New Act was made.
http://www.judis.nic.in  141
118\. It is also important to remember that the Acts saved under Section 105
of the New Act, are all Central Legislations which did not become
void/repugnant by virtue of the New Act being brought into force.
These Legislations were never subject to Article 254, and the issue of
repugnancy did not arise. It is for this reason, that the Central Acts covered
under Section 105 of the New Act, and the Impugned State Enactments cannot be
equated.
119\. Thus we hold that the impugned three state enactments were rendered
repugnant as on the date the New Act, was made, i.e. the date of which the
President of India gave the New Act his assent, i.e. 27.09.2013.
We further hold that in order to revive these acts it is necessary to re-enact
these laws, in accordance with the provisions of Article 254(2). Mere
insertion of Section 105A in the new Act, would not save these acts from
repugnancy.
Mandatory nature of 105-A(2)
120\. We have already held that merely by inserting Section 105A in the New
Act, the State could not be revived three state enactments.
Submissions have however been made across the bar at great length, that even
if Section 105A has the effect of reviving the three state enactments,
http://www.judis.nic.in  142 the fact that the requirements of Section 105A(2)
and (3) have not been made is fatal, to these acts. We deem it appropriate to
deal with these submissions.
121\. Section 105-A(2) mandates the State Government to bring out a
Notification within one year from 1.1.2014 and direct that the provisions of
the Central Act relating to the determination of compensation in accordance
with the first schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement specified in 2nd
and 3rd Schedule being beneficial to the affected families shall apply to the
case of the land acquisition and the enactment specified the 5th Schedule.
Section 105-A(2) therefore mandates that the State Government has to bring out
a Notification. Admittedly, no Notification has been brought out by the State
Government. Notification has been defined in the new Act under Section 3(v),
which reads as under:
> (v) -notification means a notification published in the Gazette of India or,
> as the case may be, the Gazette of a State and the expression -notify shall
> be construed accordingly;
122\. The New Act, therefore, specifies that a Notification should be one
which has been published in the Gazette of India or as the case may be
http://www.judis.nic.in  143 in the Gazette of State.
123\. Similarly Section 2(19-a) of the Tamil Nadu General Clause Act defines
Notification as under:
> "Notification" shall mean a notification published in the official Gazette.
124\. The learned Advocate General would submit that the Government have
brought out three Government orders dated 31.12.2014, which have been
extracted earlier. According to the learned Advocate General, the said
Government Orders categorically state that the compensation would be only in
accordance with the first schedule and the rehabilitation and resettlement
would be in accordance with the 2nd and 3rd schedules. He would state that
these copies of these Government Orders have been given to all the Principal
Secretaries/Secretaries to Government, Additional Chief
Secretary/Commissioner, Revenue Administration, Principal Secretary, Land
Reforms, all Heads of the Departments for the various departments, namely
Industries Department, the Director, Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare
Department, Highways Department and all the Collectors of the State. He would
state that these Government orders, is sufficient compliance on the
http://www.judis.nic.in  144 mandate of Section 105-A(2). He would also state
that the rules and plan, namely the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Social
Impact Assessment and Consent) Rules, 2014 and Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Development
Plan Rules, 2015, have also been framed. He would therefore state that since
these rules have been brought out, Section 105-
A(2) has been substantially complied with.
125\. Section 105-A(3) states that a copy of the Notification proposed to be
issued under sub section (2) shall be laid in draft before the Legislative
Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu and if the Legislative Assembly agrees in
disapproving the issue of the notification or the Legislative Assembly agrees
in making any modifications in the notification, the notification shall not be
issued or, as the case may be, shall be issued only in such modified form as
may be agreed upon by the Legislative Assembly.
126\. Section 105-A(1) categorically states that the provisions of the new Act
shall not apply to the enactments relating to land acquisition specified in
5th schedule. However,Section 105-A(1) also clearly states that Section
105-A(1) is only subject to Section 105-A(2). Section 105-A(2) in no uncertain
statement states that the State Government shall, by notification,
http://www.judis.nic.in  145 within one year from the date of commencement of
this Act, direct that any of the provisions of this Act, relating to the
determination of compensation in accordance with the First Schedule and
rehabilitation and resettlement specified in the Second and Third Schedules,
being beneficial to the affected families, shall apply to the cases of land
acquisition under the enactments specified in the Fifth Schedule or shall
apply with such exceptions or modifications that do not reduce the
compensation or dilute the provisions of this Act relating to compensation or
rehabilitation and resettlement as may be specified in the notification, as
the case may be. Section 105-A(2), therefore stipulates that the State
Government have to (a) issue a notification; (b) within one year from the date
of commencement of this Act;
and (c) the notification has to state that the compensation in accordance with
the First Schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement specified in the Second
and Third Schedules, would be applicable to the three enactments specified in
Fifth Schedule.
127\. The learned Advocate General has contended that the State Government
have issued Government orders relating to three enactments on 31.12.2014 and
all the three enactments specifically states that the compensation shall be
calculated in accordance with the new Act and that the rehabilitation scheme
also be only in accordance with the new Act. The question for determination is
as to whether the Government issued orders http://www.judis.nic.in  146 dated
31.12.2014 is sufficient compliance of Section 105-A(2) of the new Land
Acquisition Act.
128\. Admittedly no notification has been issued. Notification as stated
earlier has been defined in the new Act and also under the Tamil Nadu General
Clauses Act. The Government Orders dated 31.12.2014 cannot be said to be a
notification within the definition of Section 3(v) of the new Land Acquisition
Act or Section 2(19-a) of the Tamil Nadu General Clause Act.
129\. When Section 105-A has been made subject to Section 105-A(2), section
105-A(1) can work only when the conditions specified in 105-A(2) are
satisfied. Section 105-A(2) mandates that a notification has to be published.
The notification as stated earlier is defined in the Act itself to mean that
it has to be in the official gazette and shall to come within one year from
the commencement of this Act. The purpose of the notification is to inform the
general public about how the compensation is to be calculated and how the
rehabilitation scheme will be worked out.
130\. It is well settled and has been laid down by a number of judgments that
if there is power coupled with a duty mandating that the particular act must
be done by the executive in a particular way, then it shall be done in that
way or not at all.
http://www.judis.nic.in  147
131\. A perusal of Section 3(v) of the new Act, where notification means a
notification published in the Gazette of India or, as the case may be, Gazette
of a State. It is well established that when a term which is defined under the
Act, the same meaning has to be given for the term occurring throughout the
Act. Therefore, when Section 105-A(2) stipulates the State Government have to
issue a notification within one year, the notification has to be only in the
official Gazette of the State Government.
Unless and until the notification is published in an official Gazette, there
is no notification in the eye of law. The Government orders therefore, cannot
take the place of a notification, which is a defined term. Further Section
105-A(2) mandates that the State, 'shall', issue a notification within one
year. No doubt, it has been consistently laid down that no universal rule can
be laid down as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory
only or obligatory, with an implied nullification for disobedience. It is the
duty of courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the
Legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be
considered.
Crawford, on statutory construction has observed; which has been followed by a
number of judgments by the Hon'ble Supreme Court;
> "the question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon
> the intent of the Legislature and not upon the language in which the intent
> is clothed. The meaning and intention of the Legislature must govern, and
> these are to be ascertained not http://www.judis.nic.in  148 only from the
> phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its
> design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one
> way or the other.
132\. The further issue which arises is as to whether 105A(2) and (3) is a
piece of conditional legislation or delegated legislation. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in re Delhi Laws Act, 1912, Ajmer - Merwara (Extensions of
Laws) Act, 1947 Vs. Part 'C' States (Laws) Act, 1950, 1951 SCR 747:AIR 1951 SC
332, has observed as under:-
> "302. In a conditional legislation, the law is full and complete when it
> leaves the legislative chamber, but the operation of the law is made
> dependent upon the fulfilment of a condition, and what is delegated to an
> outside body is the authority to determine, by the exercise of its own
> judgment, whether or not the condition has been fulfilled. “The aim of all
> legislation”, said O'Conner, J.
in Baxter v. Ah Way [8 CLR 626 at 637] “is to project their minds as far as
possible into the future and to provide in terms as general as possible for
all contingencies likely to arise in the application of the law. But it is not
possible to provide specifically for all cases and therefore legislation from
the very earliest times, and particularly in more modern times, has taken the
form of conditional legislation, leaving it to some specified authority to
determine the circumstances in which the law shall be applied or to what its
operation shall be extended, or the particular class of persons or goods or
things to which it shall be applied”. In spite of the doctrine of separation
of powers, this form of legislation is well recognised in the legislative
practice of America, and is not considered as an encroachment upon the anti-
delegation rule at all. As stated in a leading Pennsylvania case [Locke's
Appeal, 1873 72 Pa. 491] , “the http://www.judis.nic.in  149 legislature
cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a
power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes or
intends to make its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the
wheels of Government. There are many things upon which wise and useful
legislation must depend, which cannot be known to the law-making power and
must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside the halls
of legislation”.
133\. The difference between a conditional legislation and delegated
legislation has been very succinctly explained in the case of Vasu Dev Singh &
Others Vs. Union of India & Others, (2006) 12 SCC 753, has observed as under:-
> 16\. We, at the outset, would like to express our disagreement with the
> contentions raised before us by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of

> 17\. In Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India [AIR 1960 SC 554 : (1960) 2 SCR
> 671 : 1960 Cri LJ 735] this Court stated: (AIR p. 566, para 29) “The

http://www.judis.nic.in  151 Paper and Industries Ltd. v. State of Orissa
[1991 Supp (1) SCC 81] )":
134\. Similarly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Tulsipur
Sugar Co. Ltd Vs. Notified Area Committee, (1980) 2 SCC 295, at page 305, has
observed as under:-
> "14. The essential distinction between conditional legislation and delegated
> legislation was considered for the first time by this Court in In Re The
> Delhi Laws Act, 1912 [AIR 1951 SC 332 : 1951 SCR 747] . After considering
> the decision in Queen v. Burah [5 IA 178] , Mukherjee, J., observed at p.
> 980:
> “The same principle was applied by the Judicial Committee in King v. Benoari
> Lal Sharma [72 IA 57] . In that case, the validity of an emergency ordinance
> by the Governor General of India was challenged inter alia on the ground
> that it provided for setting up of special criminal courts for particular

> Provincial Governments which were authorised to set them up at such time and
> place as they considered proper. The Judicial Committee held that ‘this is
> not delegated legislation at all. It is merely an example of the not
> uncommon legislative power by which the local application of the provisions
> of a statute is determined by the judgment of a local administrative body as
> to its necessity’.
Thus, conditional legislation has all along been treated in judicial
pronouncements not to be a species of delegated legislation at all. It comes
under a separate category, and, if in a particular case all the elements of a
conditional legislation exist, the question does not arise as to whether in
leaving the task of determining the condition to an http://www.judis.nic.in
152 outside authority, the legislature acted beyond the scope of its powers.”
15\. In Basant Kumar Sarkar v. Eagle Rolling Mills Ltd. [AIR 1964 SC 1260 :
(1964) 6 SCR 913, 916-917] this Court was required to consider the question
whether Section 1(3) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 was valid.
One of the contentions urged by the appellants in that case was that the said
provision sufferred from the vice of excessive delegation on the ground that
the power given to the Central Government to apply the provisions of that Act
by notification, conferred on the Central Government absolute discretion, the
exercise of which was not guided by any legislative provision and was,
therefore, invalid. Gajendragadkar, C.J., rejected the above contention with
the following observations:
“We are not impressed by this argument. Section 1(3) is really not an
illustration of delegated legislation at all; it is what can be properly
described as conditional legislation. The Act has prescribed a self- contained
code in regard to the insurance of the employees covered by it; several
remedial measures which the Legislature thought it necessary to enforce in
regard to such workmen have been specifically dealt with and appropriate
provisions have been made to carry out the policy of the Act as laid down in
its relevant sections. Section 3(1) of the Act purports to authorise the
Central Government to establish a Corporation for the administration of the
scheme of Employees' State Insurance by a notification. In other words, when
the notification should be issued and in respect of what factories it should
be issued, has been left to the discretion of the Central Government and that
is precisely what is usually done by conditional legislation. What Lord
Selborne said about the powers conferred on the Lieutenant Governor by virtue
of the relevant provisions of Act 22 of 1869 in Queen v. Burah [5 IA 178] ,
can be said with equal jurisdiction http://www.judis.nic.in  153 about the
powers conferred on the Central Government by Section 1(3).”
135\. As is evident from the above discussions, in case of conditional
legislation, the legislation is complete in itself but its operation is made
to depend on fulfilment of certain conditions and what is delegated to an
outside authority, is the power to determine according to its own judgment
whether or not those conditions are fulfiled. In case of delegated legislation
proper, some portion of the legislative power of the legislature is delegated
to the outside authority in that, the legislature, though competent to perform
both the essential and ancillary legislative functions, performs only the
former and parts with the latter, i.e., the ancillary functions of laying down
details in favour of another for executing the policy of the statute enacted.
The distinction between the two exists in this that whereas conditional
legislation contains no element of delegation of legislative power and is,
therefore, not open to attack on the ground of excessive delegation, delegated
legislation proper does confer some legislative power on some outside
authority and is therefore open to attack on the ground of excessive
delegation.
136\. As stated earlier, a reading of Section 105-A(1) says that it is subject
to Section 105-A(2) and 105-A(2) mandates of a notification.
http://www.judis.nic.in  154 Therefore, 105-A can come into force only if the
notification as stated in Section 105-A(2) is issued. Section 105-A(1)
therefore depends upon the fulfillment of the condition in 105-A(2). It is
well settled that enforcement of the law would depend upon the fulfillment of
the condition and what is delegated to the executive, is the authority to
determine, by exercising its own judgment as to whether such a condition has
been fulfilled/ within the time, that has given, when such legislation should
be brought into force.
When the effect of the legislation is depends upon the determination of a
condition by the executive organ of the State, it becomes a conditional
legislation and as observed in ITC Bhadrachalam's case, a conditional
legislation is mandatory. The condition that is required for Section 105-A(1)
to be active is that the notification as contemplated under Section 105-A(1)
must be published within one year from 1.1.2014.
137\. In this regard, learned counsel for the Petitioners have relied on a
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Reserve Bank of India vs. Peerless
Co. reported in (1987) 1 SCC 424, wherein, at paragraph No.33, the Hon'ble
Apex Court held as follows:
> "33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the
> bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture,
> context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored.
Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual
interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best http://www.judis.nic.in
155 interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the
statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by
clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the
context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by
such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take
colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the
glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as
a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word
is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No
part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation.
Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is
in its place. It is by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of
the entire Act and by reference to what preceded the enactment and the
reasonsfor it that the Court construed the expression “Prize Chit” in
Srinivasa and we find no reason to depart from the Court’s construction."
138\. According to the learned Advocate General, Government order issued
amounts to substantial compliance with the provisions of Section 105-
A(2) and the same were issued were only for the benefit of the Government
officers to whom the orders were sent. The purpose of this notification is
just not for the officials to calculate compensation but to inform the general
public that the effect of introduction of Sec.105-A(1) of the Act and the
procedure set out in the New Act 2013 regarding Social Impact study etc would
not be followed and that the compensation would be calculated only in
http://www.judis.nic.in  156 accordance with the First Schedule and the
rehabilitation Scheme would not be lesser than that specified in the Second
and Third Schedules. The purpose of just bringing out a Government Order
cannot therefore be said to be a compliance of Section 105-A(2), and the
argument of the Learned Advocate General must be rejected. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in I.T.C.
Bhadrachalam Paperboard and Another vs. Mandal Revenue Officer, A.P. and
others reported in (1996) 6 SCC 634, while considering the effect of non-
publication of an order/rule in official gazette has observed as under:
> "12. On the other hand, Shri Ram Kumar, learned counsel for the State of

13\. The first question we have to answer is whether the publication of the
exemption notification in the Andhra Pradesh Gazette, as required by Section
11(1) of the Act, is mandatory or merely directory? Section 11(1) requires
that an ordermade thereunder should be (i) published in the Andhra Pradesh
Gazette and (ii) must set out the grounds for granting the exemption. The
exemption may be on a permanent basis or for a specified period and shall be
subject to such restrictions or conditions as the Government may deem
necessary. Shri Sorabjee's contention is that while the requirements that the
power under Section 11 should be expressed through an order, that it must
contain the grounds for granting exemption and that the order should specify
whether the exemption is on a permanent basis or for a specified period are
mandatory, the requirement of publication in the Gazette is not. According to
the learned counsel, the said requirement is merely directory. It is enough,
says the counsel, if due publicity is given to the order. He relies upon
certain decisions to which we shall presently refer. We find it difficult to
agree. The power under Section 11 is in the nature of conditional legislation,
as would be explained later. The object of publication in the Gazette is not
merely to give information to public. Official Gazette, as the very name
indicates, is an official document. It is http://www.judis.nic.in  158
published under the authority of the Government. Publication of an order or
rule in the Gazette is the official confirmation of the making of such an
order or rule. The version as printed in the Gazette is final. The same order
or rule may also be published in the newspapers or may be broadcast by radio
or television. If a question arises when was a particular order or rule made,
it is the date of Gazette publication that is relevant and not the date of
publication in a newspaper or in the media (See Pankaj Jain Agencies v. Union
of India [(1994) 5 SCC 198] ). In other words, the publication of an order or
rule is the official irrefutable affirmation that a particular order or rule
is made, is made on a particular day (where the order or rule takes effect
from the date of its publication) and is made by a particular authority; it is
also the official version of the order or rule. It is a common practice in
courts to refer to the Gazette whenever there is a doubt about the language
of, or punctuation in, an Act, Rule or Order. Section 83 of the Evidence Act,
1872 says that the court shall presume the genuineness of the Gazette. Court
will take judicial notice of what is published therein, unlike the publication
in a newspaper, which has to be proved as a fact as provided in the Evidence
Act. If a dispute arises with respect to the precise language or contents of a
rule or order, and if such rule or order is not published in the Official
Gazette, it would become necessary to refer to the original itself, involving
a good amount of inconvenience, delay and unnecessary controversies. It is for
this reason that very often enactments provide that Rules and/or Regulations
and certain type of orders made thereunder shall be published in the Official
Gazette. To call such a requirement as a dispensable one — directory
requirement — is, in our opinion, unacceptable. Section 21 of the Andhra
Pradesh General Clauses Act says that even where an Act or Rule provides
merely for publication but does not http://www.judis.nic.in  159 say expressly
that it shall be published in the Official Gazette, it would be deemed to have
been duly made if it is published in the Official Gazette [ Section 21
reads:“21. Publication of Orders and Notifications in the Official
Gazette.—Where in any Act or in any rule passed under any Act, it is directed
that any order, notification or other matter shall be notified or published,
that notification or publication shall, unless the Act otherwise provides, be
deemed to be duly made if it is published in the Official Gazette.”] . As
observed by Khanna, J., speaking for himself and Shelat, J. in Sammbhu Nath
Jha v. Kedar Prasad Sinha [(1972) 1 SCC 573 : 1972 SCC (Cri) 337] the
requirement of publication in the Gazette (SCC p. 578, para 17) “is an
imperative requirement and cannot be dispensed with”. The learned Judge was
dealing with Section 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 which
provides inter alia that a Commission of Inquiry shall be appointed “by
notification in the Official Gazette”. The learned Judge held that the said
requirement is mandatory and cannot be dispensed with. The learned Judge
further observed: (SCC p. 578, para 17) “The commission of inquiry is
appointed for the purpose of making an inquiry into some matter of public
importance. The schedule containing the various allegations in the present
case was a part of the notification, dated 12-3-1968 and specified definite
matters of public importance which were to be inquired into by the Commission.
As such, the publication of the schedule in the Official Gazette should be
held to be in compliance with the statutory requirement. The object of
publication in an Official Gazette is twofold: to give publicity to the
notification and further to provide authenticity to the contents of that
notification in case some dispute arises with regard to the contents.”

139\. In the said judgment in paragraph 14, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, with
approval quoted a passage from B.K.Srinivasan v. State of Karnataka reported
in (1987) 1 SCC 658, held as under:
> 14\. To the same effect are the observations in B.K. Srinivasan v. State of
> Karnataka [(1987) 1 SCC 658] . While pointing out the importance of
> subordinate legislation in the affairs of the modern State, Chinnappa Reddy,
> J., speaking for himself and G.L. Oza, J., made the following observations:
> (SCC pp. 672-73, para 15) “But unlike Parliamentary legislation which is
> publicly made, delegated or subordinate legislation is often made
> unobtrusively in the chambers of a Minister, a Secretary to the Government
> or other official dignitary. It is, therefore, necessary that subordinate
> legislation, in order to take effect, must be published or promulgated in
> some suitable manner, whether such publication or promulgation is prescribed
> by the parent statute or not.
It will then take effect from the date of such publication or promulgation.
Where the parent statute prescribes the mode of publication or promulgation
that mode must be followed. Where the parent statute is silent, but the
subordinate legislation itself prescribes the manner of publication, such a
mode of publication may be sufficient, if reasonable. If the subordinate
legislation does not prescribe the mode of publication or if the subordinate
legislation prescribes a plainly unreasonable mode of publication, it will
take effect only when it is published through the customarily recognised
official http://www.judis.nic.in  161 channel, namely, the Official Gazette or
some other reasonable mode of publication.”
140\. This judgment would apply squarely to the cases on hand. As stated
earlier, Section 105-A(1) is dependent upon Section 105-A(2) and therefore
until the condition of Section 105-A(2) is satisfied with, Section 105-A
cannot be given effect.
141\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in State of Tamil Nadu vs. K.Sabanayagam and
Another reported in (1998) 1 SCC 318 has held that conditional legislations
are mandatory. In the said judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraph
Nos.14 and 15 held as under:
> "14. This takes us to the last contention canvassed on behalf of the
> appellants. It is true that Section 36 of the Act is held by a Constitution
> Bench of this Court to be a piece of conditional legislation. In the case of
> Jalan Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. Mill Mazdoor Sabha [AIR 1967 SC 691 : (1967) 1
> SCR 15 : (1966) 2 LLJ 546] the majority of the Constitution Bench speaking
> through J.C. Shah, J. while interpreting Section 36 of the Act has made the
> following pertinent observations:
“By Section 36 the appropriate government is invested with power to exempt an
establishment or a class of establishments from the operation of the Act,
provided the Government is of the opinion that having regard to the financial
position and other relevant circumstances of the establishment, it would not
be in the public interest to apply all or any of the provisions of the Act.
Condition for http://www.judis.nic.in  162 exercise of that power is that the
government holds the opinion that it is not in the public interest to apply
all or any of the provisions of the Act to an establishment or class of
establishments, and that opinion is founded on a consideration of the
financial position and other relevant circumstances. Parliament has clearly
laid down principles and has given adequate guidance to the appropriate
government in implementing the provisions of Section
36\. The power so conferred does not amount to delegation of legislative
authority. Section 36 amounts to conditional legislation, and is not void.
Whether in a given case, power has been properly exercised by the appropriate
government would have to be considered when that occasion arises.” The said
observations have been made for repelling the challenge to the vires of
Section 36 of the Act on the ground that it amounted to excessive delegation
of legislative power or was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. The question with which we are concerned in the present proceedings was
not on the anvil of scrutiny before the Constitution Bench of this Court in
that case, namely, whether before exercising powers under Section 36 as a
delegate of conditional legislative function the appropriate government was
estopped from considering the rival version or rebuttal evidence that may be
offered by the employees whose employer seeks exemption from the Act under
Section 36 thereof. The distinction between delegated legislation and
conditional legislation is a clear and well-settled one. In this connection we
may usefully refer to a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case
of Hamdard Dawakhana(Wakf) v. Union of India [AIR 1960 SC 554 : (1960) 2 SCR
671] . Kapur, J. speaking for the Constitution Bench has made the following
pertinent observations at pp. 695-96 of the Report:
“The distinction between conditional legislation and delegated
http://www.judis.nic.in  163 legislation is this that in the former the
delegate's power is that of determining when a legislative declared rule of
conduct shall become effective; Hampton & Co. v. U.S. [276 US 394 : 72 L Ed
624 (1928)] and the latter involves delegation of rule-making power which
constitutionally may be exercised by the administrative agent. This means that
the legislature having laid down the broad principles of its policy in the
legislation can then leave the details to be supplied by the administrative
authority. In other words by delegated legislation the delegate completes the
legislation by supplying details within the limits prescribed by the statute
and in the case of conditional legislation the power of legislation is
exercised by the legislature conditionally leaving to the discretion of an
external authority the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect
as also the determination of the area to which it is to extend; (R. v. Burah
[(1878) 3 AC 889, PC] ; Russell v. R. [(1882) 7 AC 829 : 51 LJPC 77, PC] , AC
at p. 835; King Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sarma [(1944) 72 IA 57 : AIR 1945 PC
48] ; Sardar Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan [AIR 1957 SC 510 : 1957 SCR
605] ). Thus when the delegate is given the power of making rules and
regulations in order to fill in the details to carry out and subserve the
purposes of the legislation the manner in which the requirements of the
statute are to be met and the rights therein created to be enjoyed it is an
exercise of delegated legislation. But when the legislation is complete in
itself and the legislature has itself made the law and the only function left
to the delegate is to apply the law to an area or to determine the time and
manner of carrying it into effect, it is conditional legislation.” It is thus
obvious that in the case of conditional legislation, the legislation is
complete in itself but its operation is made to depend on fulfilment of
certain conditions and what is delegated to an http://www.judis.nic.in  164
outside authority, is the power to determine according to its own judgment
whether or not those conditions are fulfilled. In case of delegated
legislation proper, some portion of the legislative power of the legislature
is delegated to the outside authority in that, the legislature, though
competent to perform both the essential and ancillary legislative functions,
performs only the former and parts with the latter, i.e., the ancillary
function of laying down details in favour of another for executing the policy
of the statute enacted. The distinction between the two exists in this that
whereas conditional legislation contains no element of delegation of
legislative power and is, therefore, not open to attack on the ground of
excessive delegation, delegated legislation does confer some legislative power
on some outside authority and is therefore open to attack on the ground of
excessive delegation. In this connection we may also refer to a decision of
this Court rendered in the case of Sardar Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan
[AIR 1957 SC 510 : 1957 SCR 605] wherein it is laid down that when an
appropriate legislature enacts a law and authorises an outside authority to
bring it into force in such area or at such time as it may decide, that is
conditional and not delegated legislation.
15\. A number of decisions of this Court were pressed into service by the
learned Senior Counsel for the appellants to submit that there is no question
of giving any hearing to the affected parties by an agent who exercises
conditional legislative power. We may briefly refer to them."
142\. Apart from Section 105-A(2), 105-A(3) mandates that the draft of the
Notification has to be placed before the two Houses for approval. If the
assembly rejects the proposed notification or suggested changes, then the
http://www.judis.nic.in  165 notification cannot be brought out. It is well
settled that when a power is given by a statute to do a particular thing in a
particular manner, the thing shall be done only in that manner or not at all.
The Privy council in Nazir Ahmad vs. King Emperor reported in AIR 1936 Privy
Council 253(2) has observed as under:
> " The rule which applies is a different and not less well recognized rule,
> namely, that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way
> the thing must be done in that way or not at all."
143\. A perusal of Section 105-A(3) would show that the purpose of keeping the
Notification before the House is to satisfy the elected members of people that
the new Act, exempts a procedure in the matter of acquiring lands, for
thepurpose mentioned in the three Acts, and that the compensation for the land
and rehabilitating/resettlement schemes which have been offered is in no way
inferior or rater is equal to the mode specified in Schedules I and II
respectively. This shows that Section 105-
A(3) is not a subordinate legislation for making rules, which could be
delegated to the authorities. The judgments relied on by the learned Advocate
General, namely (1) Prohibition & Excise Supdt. A.P. and others vs. Toddy
Tappers Co-Op. Society, Marredpally and Ors reported in (2003) 12 SCC 738; (2)
K.T.Plantation Private Limited and Another vs. State of Karnataka reported in
(2011) 9 SCC 1; and (3) Accountant General, State of Madhya Pradesh vs.
S.K.Dubey and http://www.judis.nic.in  166 Another reported in (2012) 4 SCC
578, deal with subordinate legislation i.e. placing the rules before the two
Houses. Section 105-A(3) affects the rights of parties. The very purpose of
bringing this new enactment is to ensure that certain procedure constituted in
the New Act 2013, would not be applicable when acquisition of lands is taken
for the purpose of the three Acts and also includes that people whose lands
are acquired get adequate compensation and are effectively resettled. The Act
came into force primarily as stated earlier because it was found that lands
are being acquired without providing adequate rehabilitation and turning
agriculturists, into landless labourers. To make matters worse, the Land so
acquired was not put to use for substantial period of time. It is only to
remedy all these ills; the new Act was brought into force. In the said
context, it is impossible for us to hold that the notification to be issued
under Section 105-A(2) and placed before the Houses in Section 105-A(3)
subordinate legislation can be delegated to rule making authorities, by
issuing Government orders, Notification has to be issued and placed before the
legislative house for approval.
144\. 'Notification' as envisaged in the Act 2013 and General Clause Act,
1897, a subordinate legislation, cannot be equivalent to Government Order,
which according to the learned Advocate General issued to the officers. Even
if we are to accept the argument of the Advocate General that the G.O. Ms.
No.251, 169 and 110, all dated 31.12.2014 are “notifications”,
http://www.judis.nic.in  167 all these G.O.’s would have to be placed before
the assembly in the draft stage and if the assembly after considering the
Government Orders was not satisfied then the notification of the Government
Orders will not come into force. Assuming that they are notifications for the
purposes of the New Act, the question to then be determined by us, is whether
the placing of these notifications in the draft stage, is mandatory or
directory?
145\. The learned Advocate General has placed reliance on several judgments to
substantiate the contention that the condition to place the notification
before the Houses is only directory and non-fulfillment of the condition will
not make the act ineffective. In Atlas Cycle Industries vs. State of Haryana
reported in 1979 (2) SCC 196, the Hon'ble Supreme court was dealing with the
provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955.
Section 3(6) of the Act, mandated every order made under Section 3 of the
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 by Central Government are by an officer or
authority of a Central Government shall be laid before both the Houses of the
Parliament made after it was made. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 20
and 21 observed as under:
> "20. Thus two considerations for regarding a provision as directory are: (1)
> absence of any provision for the contingency of a particular provision not
> being complied with or followed, and (2) serious general inconvenience and
> prejudice that would result to the general public if the act of
> http://www.judis.nic.in  168 the Government or an instrumentality is
> declared invalid for non-compliance with the particular provision.
> 21\. Now, the policy and object underlying the provisions relating to laying
> the delegated legislation made by the subordinate law making authorities or
> orders passed by subordinate executive instrumentalities before both Houses
> of Parliament being to keep supervision and control over the aforesaid
> authorities and instrumentalities, the “laying clauses” assume different
> forms depending on the degree of control which the Legislature may like to
> exercise. As evident from the observations made at pp. 305 to 307 of the 7th
> Edn. of Craies on Statute Law and noticed with approval in Hukam Chand v.
> Union of India [(1972) 2 SCC 601 : AIR 1972 SC 2427 : (1973) 1 SCR 896]
> there are three kinds of laying which are generally used by the Legislature.
> These three kinds of laying are described and dealt with in Craies on
> Statute Law as under:
> “(i) Laying without further procedure,
> (ii) Laying subject to negative resolution,
> (iii) Laying subject to affirmative resolution.
> (i) Simple laying.—The most obvious example is in Section 10(2) of the 1946
> Act. In earlier days, before the idea of laying in draft had been
> introduced, there was a provision for laying rules etc. for a period during
> which time they were not in operation and could be thrown out without ever
> having come into operation (compare Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, Section
> 417; Inebriates Act, 1898, Section 21) but this is not used now.
(ii) Negative resolution.—Instruments so laid have immediate operative effect
but are subject to annulment http://www.judis.nic.in  169 within forty days
without prejudice to a new instrument being made. The phraseology generally
used is “subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of
Parliament”. This is by far the commonest form of laying. It acts mostly as a
deterrent and sometimes forces a Minister (in Sir Cecil Carr's phrase) to “buy
off opposition” by promising some modification.
(iii) Affirmative resolution.—The phraseology here is normally no order shall
be made unless a draft has been laid before Parliament and has been approved
by a resolution of each House of Parliament. Normally, no time limit is fixed
for obtaining approval — none is necessary because the Government will
naturally take the earliest opportunity of bringing it up for approval — but
Section 16(3) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,
1946 did impose a limit of forty days. An old form (not much used nowadays)
provided for an order to be made but not to become operative until a
resolution of both Houses of Parliament had been obtained. This form was used
in Section 10(4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1930 [cf. Road Traffic Act, 1960,
Section 19(3)] .... The affirmative resolution procedure necessitates a debate
in every case. This means that one object of delegation of legislation (viz.
saving the time of Parliament) is to some extent defeated. The procedure
therefore is sparingly used and is more or less reserved to cases where the
order almost amounts to an Act, by effecting changes which approximate to true
legislation (e.g. where the order is the meat of the matter, the enabling Act
merely outlining the general purpose) or where the order replaces local Acts
or provisional orders and, most important of all, where the spending, etc. of
public money is affected.
http://www.judis.nic.in  170 Sometimes where speedy or secret action is
required (e.g. the imposition of import duties), the order is laid with
immediate operation but has to be confirmed within a certain period [cf.
Import Duties Act, 1958, Section 13(4)]. This process of acting first and
getting approval after has also been adopted in the Emergency Powers Act, 1920
under which a state of emergency can be proclaimed and regulations made. The
proclamation must be immediately communicated to Parliament and does not have
effect for longer than a month; but it can be replaced by another
proclamation. Any regulations made under the proclamation are to be laid
before Parliament immediately and do not continue in force after the
expiration of seven days from the time when they are so laid unless a
resolution is passed by both Houses providing for their continuance.”
146\. Reading of paragraph 21 would show that the policy and object underlying
Section 3(6) relates to laying the delegated legislation made by the
subordinate law making authorities/orders passed by subordinate executive
instrumentalities, before both the Houses of parliament was to keep the
supervision and control over the aforesaid authorities and instrumentalities.
The underlying purpose was only to keep a check. The court found that by not
laying it before the Houses does not vitiate the subordinate legislation.
147\. Similarly, in Quarry Owners' Association vs. State of Bihar reported in
2000 (8) SCC 655, dealing with Section 28 of the Mines and
http://www.judis.nic.in  171 Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraph No.45 held as under:
> "45. It is true that the language of both sub-section (1) and sub-section
> (3) of Section 28 is different. They are reproduced below:
> “28. Rules and notifications to be laid before Parliament and certain rules
> to be approved by Parliament.—(1) Every rule and every notification made by
> the Central Government under this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after
> it is made, before each House of Parliament while it is in session for a
> total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two
> or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the session
> immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both
> Houses agree in making any modification in the rule or notification or both
> Houses agree that the rule or notification should not be made, the rule or
> notification shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be
> of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such modification or
> annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously
> done under that rule or notification.
*** (3) Every rule and every notification made by the State Government under
this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House
of the State Legislature where it consists of two Houses, or where such
legislature consists of one House, before that House.” There is no difficulty
for us to uphold their submissions that in view http://www.judis.nic.in  172
of difference in the language of sub-section (3), the same meaning to it as
that of sub-section (1) cannot be given. This difference has been carved out
for a purpose to give different projection to the said two provisions. In the
case of major minerals which play important role in the national growth and
wealth and where the delegatee is the Central Government, Parliament retained
its full control but for the minor minerals, Parliament felt for the minor
minerals as the subject is of local use and the State Government being well
versed in dealing with it in the historical background, mere placement of
rules, notifications framed by it before the State Legislature would be a
sufficient check on the exercise of its powers. Thus, this difference of
language gives two different thrusts as intended by Parliament. Any act of
Parliament, far less when it introduces any new provision through amendment,
it could be said for it to be in futility. The purpose has to be found. What
could be the purpose for such an amendment? One of the reasons is that this
was brought in, in view of the observation made by this Court in D.K. Trivedi
[1986 Supp SCC 20] . This Court records: (SCC p. 62, para 51) “It was,
therefore, for Parliament to decide whether rules and notifications made by
the State Governments under Section 15(1) should be laid before Parliament or
the legislature of the State or not. It, however, thought it fit to do so with
respect to minerals other than minor minerals since these minerals are of
vital importance to the country's industry and economy, but did not think it
fit to do so in the case of minor minerals because it did not consider them to
be of equal importance.” Parliament through its wisdom, apart from the above
brought this amendment also to keep a check on the exercise of power by the
State Government as delegatee. The question is whether mere laying
http://www.judis.nic.in  173 of rules and notifications before the
legislature, as in the present case, can be construed as a check on the State
Government's power.
Laying before the Houses of Parliament is done in three different ways. Laying
of any rule may be subject to any negative resolution within a specified
period or may be subject to its confirmation. This is spoken of as negative
and positive resolution respectively. Third may be mere laying before the
House. In the present case, we are not concerned with either the affirmative
or negative procedure but consequence of mere laying before the legislature."
148\. The Hon'ble Supreme court, while deciding as to when in not placing the
rule before the parliament would make the rule inoperative, held as under:
> "55. However, since we have upheld the impugned notifications issued by the
> State to be within the ambit of delegation and that delegation is not
> excessive as there are enough guidelines and control over the State
> Government, notwithstanding its check on the State under sub-section (3) of
> Section 28, it would not have any effect on its validity. But we make it
> clear that when a statute as under sub-section (3) of Section 28 requires
> its placement, it is the obligation of the State Government to place such
> with this specific note before each House of State Legislature. Even if it
> has not been done, the State shall now do place before each House of the
> State Legislature at the earliest, the notification dated 28-9-1994 and will
> also do so in future while framing rules or issuing any notifications under
> the Rules framed under sub- section (1) of Section 15 of the Act."
http://www.judis.nic.in  174
149\. The Hon’ble Apex Court made these observations in the context of the
serious general inconvenience and prejudice that will be result to the general
public by not placing the notifications before Parliament. In the present
case, as stated, the land owners are losing land, by not resorting to a
procedure which is contemplated in Act 2013. The mandate on the Government is
that the rehabilitation and resettlement package and the compensation will not
be lesser than which is to be paid under the new Land Acquisition Act. When
the nature, scope and ambit of the Act is to deviate from the procedure set
out in 2013 Act, one cannot say that the provision is only directory. If the
learned Advocate General's argument is accepted, then the substantial rights
of the parties will be affected. If Section 105-A(3) has to be interpreted as
directory, then the elected members / representatives of people who are the
lawmakers will not have any say in with respect to procedure to be followed
compensation and rehabilitation schemes. Leaving the notification entirely to
the executive without the legislature having any say in it, will make the
notification susceptible to the challenge of excessive delegation.
150\. The Learned Advocate General has also relied on the Judgement of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case ofThe Prohibition & Excise Supdt., A.P. &
Ors. vs. Toddy Tappers Coop. Society, Marredpally&Orsreported in 2003 (12) SCC
738, wherein the court was http://www.judis.nic.in  175 dealing with Section
72(3) and 72(4) of the Andhra Pradesh Excise Act, 1968, which action was
dealing only with rule making powers. Section 72(3) and 72(4) of the said Act
reads as under:
(3) Any rule under this Act may be made with retrospective effect and when
such a rule is made the reasons for making the rule shall be specified in a
statement to be laid before both Houses of the State Legislature.
(4) Every rule made under this Act, shall, immediately after it is made be
laid before each House of State Legislature if it is in session and if it is
not in session, in the session immediately following for a total period of
fourteen days which may be comprised in one session or in two successive
sessions and if, before the expiration of the session in which it is so laid
or the session immediately following, both Houses agree in making any
modification in the rule or in the annulment of the rule, the rule shall, from
the date on which the modification or annulment is notified, have effect only
in such modified form or shall stand annulled, as the case may be, so however
that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the
validity of anything previously done under that rule.”
151\. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraph Nos.28, 30 and
31, held as under:
> 28\. Sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act merely provides for laying
> down the rules before both the Houses of the legislature with the reasons
> for giving a retrospective effect.
The said provision does not speak of the necessity to obtain permission or
prior approval therefor by the Houses of the http://www.judis.nic.in  176
legislature. Only in the event the legislature is not satisfied with the
sufficiency or otherwise of the reasons assigned, it may direct that the same
would operate prospectively. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 72 must be
read in such a manner that both may be given effect to. Sub-section (3) deals
with only a special situation, whereas sub-section (4) is general in nature.
In the event, a negative resolution is adopted the rules will cease to have
the force of law. Difference between sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 72
lies in the fact that whereas in case the rule is given retrospectivity, the
members of both the Houses of the legislature shall be apprised of the reasons
therefor, whereas in case of a rule which is prospective in nature, simple
laying down before both the Houses would serve the statutory object.
30\. In that case, therefore, laying of the rules before both the Houses was
held to be subject to affirmative resolution.
31\. Interpreting the said provision, it was observed: (SCC p. 310, para 8)
“Mere perusal of sub-section (2) shows that there has to be a positive act of
approval by Parliament to the issuance of the notification before it can be
held that Schedule I has been amended. Merely laying the notification before
each House of Parliament is not sufficient compliance within the provisions of
Section 16(2). There is of course no time-limit within which the Houses of
Parliament are required to pass a resolution once the Central Government has
sought approval as contemplated by sub-section (2), but in the present case
the pleadings disclose that no such approval was in fact sought for.”
(emphasis sought for) http://www.judis.nic.in  177
152\. Here again, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing only with the rule
making power and not dealing with the substantive rights of the parties.
Further the said judgment was dealing with acts where rule has been made and
that rule which has been made was not placed before the Houses.
Importantly, no substantive rights of individuals are adversely affected by
not placing the rules before the Legislature, and therefore, this case
therefore will not come to the aid of State of Tamil Nadu.
153\. The Learned Advocate General has also placed reliance on K.T.Plantation
Private Limited and Another vs. State of Karnataka reported in (2011) 9 SCC 1,
the Hon'ble court, while dealing with Section 140 of the Roerich and
Devikarani Roerich Estate (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1996, at paragraphs
76 and 80, observed as under:
> 76\. For easy reference Section 140 is extracted hereunder:
> “140.Rules and notifications to be laid before the State Legislature.—Every
> rule made under this Act and every notification issued under Sections 109,
> 110 and 139 shall be laid as soon as may be after it is made or issued

> 80\. Section 140 does not require the State Legislature to give its approval

154\. The observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph 80 is to the
effect that Section 140 does not require state legislature to give its
approval for bringing into effect to the notification. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that the fact that the State Legislature did not by any positive
act approve of the impugned notifications/rules, would not affect the legal
validity of those impugned notifications and rules. However, if we look at
http://www.judis.nic.in  179 Section 140, quoted in the judgment it is not
parimateria to Section 105-
A(3), and therefore does not come to the aid of the State of Tamil Nadu, in
the present case. The language employed by the Legislature in Section 105-
A, cannot be construed in a manner that laying of the notifications before the
State Legislature is only directory. So even if the G.O.’s are to be taken to
be “notifications” the failure to lay these before the State Legislature is
fatal, and therefore the provision of Section 105A-(3) has not been complied
with.
155\. The learned Advocate General has also contended that the failure to lay
these Government Orders is a curable defect, and that they can still be laid
before the State Legislature. However, this Court has already taken the view
that these G.O.s cannot be construed as “notifications” under the New Act.
Thus this argument of the Learned Advocate Generalcannot be sustained in view
of the fact that the Government orders are not notifications and there is no
notification as postulated under Section 105-
A(2) which can be laid. By issuig Government orders, there is not even
substantive compliance of the conditions. As pointed out notification is to
inform the general public as to how the procedure would be followed,
resettlement will be fixed and how the compensation was to be calculated.
Merely by saying that the compensation calculated will not be lesser than one
arrived at in the new Act would not make the Government Order equal
http://www.judis.nic.in  180 to a notification.
156\. We therefore are of the unequivocal view, that the mandatory provision
of Section 105-A has not been complied and therefore Section 105-A cannot be
said to have come into force in the absence of the notification as stipulated
in Section 105-A(2) and also non-placing the notification before the Assembly.
157\. The learned Advocate General also made a submission that, large extent
of lands which have been acquired under the three State enactments after
01.01.2014, have been put to use and projects have, on those lands and now it
will be impossible to return the lands. In those lands where the purpose for
which the land was acquired and to put to use, it will be impossible to return
those lands to the land owners. Issuing any direction to
http://www.judis.nic.in  181 the land owners, now would be unscrambling a
scrambled egg. In such cases, we can only direct that the compensation and the
rehabilitation must be strictly made in accordance with the New Land
Acquisition Act.
Conclusions:
158\. In view of the discussion, the net result of Writ Petitions before us is
as follows:
> 158.1. Contention of petitioners that the President failed to apply his mind
> while granting assent to Section 105-A of the New Act, cannot be accepted.
> 158.2. The Petitioners have also not demonstrated, how and why the impugned
> State Acts were arbitrary in nature, and liable to be stuck down on the
> ground of being manifestly arbitrary.
> 158.3. However, the Writ Petitioners before us ultimately succeed because,
> Article 254(1) by its operation rendered the impugned Tamil Nadu
> Legislations repugnant, and null and void, as on the date on which the New
> Act was made, i.e. 27.09.2013, the date of making of the New Act, as held in
> the case of State of Kerala v Maar AppraemKuri Co. (Supra) and therefore the
> impugned Acts do not survive.
> 158.4. By enacting Section 105-A of the New Act, the State of Tamil Nadu
> could not have revived the three state Acts, that had become repugnant as on
> 27.09.2013.
> 158.5. In order to revive these acts, the State must re-
enact these statutes, in accordance with Article 254(2) of the
http://www.judis.nic.in  182 Constitution of India, and obtain the assent of
the President.
Merely, by inserting Section 105-A and the 5th Schedule, in the new Act, these
impugned enactments do not get revived. Since this had admittedly not been
done, the Acts remain repugnant, and Article 254(1) renders them inoperative.
158.6. In view of the requirements of Article 254(2) of the Constitution of
India, Section 105-A of the New Act, is virtually otiose. Since We have
already held that Section 105-A has not revived the State Acts, the validity
of Section 105-A per se, need not be examined by us.
158.7. The provisions of Section 105A(2) and (3) are mandatory in view of the
necessity of complying with these provisions. The State Government has failed
to make the necessary notifications, as contemplated under 105A(2) and as such
the provisions of Section 105A(2) have not been satisfied. Since the
notifications have not been made under sub-section (2) the requirement of sub-
section (3) i.e. placing the draft notifications before the State Legislature
has also obviously not been met. We therefore hold, that the requirements of
Section 105A(2) & (3) have not been satisfied, and as such the insertion of
the enactments in the 5th Schedule of the new Act, was not done in accordance
with law.
158.8. Consequently, all the acquisitions made under the three impugned
enactments made on or after 27.09.2013, are held to be illegal and quashed
save those lands which have already been put to use and the purpose for which
the land was acquired has been accomplished.
159\. All the writ petitions are allowed as indicated above. The
http://www.judis.nic.in  183 connected writ miscellaneous petitions and other
miscellaneous petitions are closed. However, there shall be no order as to
costs.
