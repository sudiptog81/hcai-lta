Government had taken possession of the land. Once the possession of the land
is taken it is not open to the government to withdraw from the acquisition.
The very letter dated 24.2.1990 relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner
recites that 'before restoring the possession to the society the amount of
development charges will have to be returned back............. This shows
clearly that possession was taken over by the Housing Board. Indeed the very
tenor of the letter is, asking the Housing Board as to what development work
they had carried out on the land and how much expenditure they had incurred
thereon, which could not have been done unless the Board was in possession of
the land. The Housing Board was asked to send the full particulars of the
expenditure and not to carry on any further development works on that land.
Reading the letter as a whole, it cannot but be said that the possession of
the land was taken by the government and was also delivered to the Housing
Board. Since the possession of the land was taken, there could be no question
of withdrawing from the acquisition under section 48 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894\.

    HEADNOTE:
    Notification  under  Section  4(1)  of	the  Rajasthan	Land
    Acquisition  Act 1953 was published in the Gazette  for	 the
    acquisition  of	 certain  lands	 for  the  benefit  of	 the
    Rajasthan  Housing Board.  Another notification	 was  issued
    under S. 17(4) dispensing with the provisions of S. 5(A)  of
    the Act.  A declaration under S.6 of the Act was also issues
    in  respect  of that area.  The validity  of  the  aforesaid
    notifications was challenged before the High Court by way of
    writ  petitions.   The	challenge made	was  mainly  on	 the
    grounds that since the land acquired was not waste or arable
    land inasmuch as there were houses, huts, cattle sheds	etc.
    on  the land, the inquiry contemplated under S.	 5(A)  could
    not have been dispensed with; that there was no real urgency
    for  dispensing	 with the Inquiry and that  the	 houses	 and
    other structures on the land should not have been  acquired.
    The  Writ  Petitions were dismissed by a  Single  Judge	 and
    Special Appeals were preferred to Division Bench.  Since the
    two Judges In the Division Bench deferred in their opinions,
    the  matter  was referred to Third Judge.  The	Third  Judge
    recorded his opinion on the questions, viz., whether it	 was
    necessary or obligatory for the Government to mention in the
    notification issued under S. 17(4) that the land proposed to
    be acquired was waste or arable and whether the	 non-mention
    thereof, vitiated the said notifica
    270
    tions; and if a small fraction of an arable land proposed to
    be acquired was occupied by buildings like buts kham  houses
    and  pucca houses for residential purposes and	for  keeping
    fodder,	 cattle	 farms, cattle sheds and for  similar  other
    purposes, was it still permissible to treat the entire	land
    as  arable land and Issue notification under s.	 17(4)	read
    with  Section  17(1) of the Rajasthan Land  Acquisition	 Act
    1953,  and the legal consequences thereof.  Then the  matter
    went  back  to the Division Bench which	 observed  that	 the
    opinion	 of the Third Judge was not categorical on the	last
    question.   Therefore, the last question was referred  to  a
    Full  Bench.   By a majority view the Full Bench  held	that
    inasmuch as there were pucca and kutcha houses, cattle-sheds
    etc.  on  a fraction of a land proposed to be  acquired	 and
    since	the  notification  was	not  severable	the   entire
    notification  under s. 17(4) failed.  Accordingly, the	Full
    Bench  quashed	the  declaration  under s.  6  of  the	Act.
    Against	 this  the respondent Board  preferred	the  present
    appeal.	  Contending that the matter stood concluded by	 the
    decision of this Court in State of U.P. v. Smt.	 Pista Devi,
    [1986] 4 SCC 251.
    The Writ Petition flied before this Court claimed that since
    the  Petitioner	 Society  also	fulfilled  the	same  public
    purpose served by the housing Board viz. housing, the  Urban
    Development Minister had recommended that the land  allotted
    to  the petitioner.  Society be denotified  and	 de-acquired
    and  to regularise the scheme of the Society, and  that	 the
    Chief  Minister	 has accepted the same.	  The  Society	thus
    contended  that	 the proceedings were final  and  its  lands
    could not be acquired.
    Allowing the appeals by the Housing Board and dismissing the
    Writ Petition flied by the Housing Society, this Court,
    HELD  : 1. 'Mere was material before the government in	this
    case  upon  which it could have and did form  the  requisite
    opinion	 that  it was a case calling for exercise  of  power
    under Section 17(4) of the Rajasthan land Ceiling Act, 1953.
    The  material  placed before the Court	disclosed  that	 the
    government  found,  on due verification, that there  was  an
    acute  scarcity	 of land and there was	heavy  pressure	 for
    construction of houses for weaker sections and middle income
    group people, that the Housing Board had obtained a loan  of
    Rs.16 crores under a time-bound	 programme to construct	 and
    utilise	  the  said  amount  by	 31.3.1983;  that   in	 the
    circumstances  the  Government	was  satisfied	that  unless
    possession  was	 taken immediately, and	 the  Housing  Board
    permitted to proceed with
    271
    the  construction, the Board will not be able to  adhere  to
    the  time-bound	 programme.There  were	also  certain  other
    materials  upon	 which the government had  formed  the	said
    satisfaction  viz, that In view of the time-bound  programme
    stipulated  by	the  lendor, HUDCO, the	 Board	and  already
    appointed a large number of engineers and other	 subordinate
    staff  for  carrying out the said work and that	 holding  an
    inquiry	 under Section 5-A would have resulted	in  uncalled
    for delay endangering the entire scheme and time-schedule of
    the Housing Board.  The satisfaction under Section 17(4)  of
    the  Act  Is a subjective one and that so long as  there  is
    material  upon	which the government could have	 formed	 the
    said satisfaction fairly, the court would not interfere	 nor
    would  it  examine the material as an  appellate  authority.
    This is the principle affirmed by decision of this Court not
    only under Section 17(4) but also generally with respect  to
    subjective satisfaction. [279E-H, 280A-B]

    2.1. The petitioner-cooperative society which claims to have
    purchased  about  525  bighas of  land	from  the  khatedars
    represented   to  the  Government  to  de-notify  the	land
    purchased by them.  On the basis of the said representation,
    the  then  Minister in-charge of Urban	Development  took  a
    decision  to release the lands but he was over-ruled by	 the
    then Chief Minister.  This issue lay dormant till 1990	till
    the  general elections were announced.	It is at this  stage
    the petitioner-society made a representation to the Minister
    for  Urban Development to de-notify the lands  purchased  by
    them.	The Minister for Urban Development  recommended	 de-
    notification  which  was  approved by  the  Chief  Minister.
    [281A-D]
    2.2. 'Mere  was no final decision at any time  to  de-notify
    the said lands.	 A tentative decision was no doubt taken  in
    February,  1990	 but  before it	 could	be  implemented	 the
    government thought it necessary to ascertain the view of the
    Housing Board and to find out as to what the Board had	done
    upon the land, what structures it had raised and what amount
    it  had spent so that the Board could be  compensated  while
    delivering  the	 possession  back to  the  Housing  society.
    Before	this  could  be	 done there  was  a  change  In	 the
    Government and the said tentative decision
    272
    was  reversed.	 In  this  view of the	matter,	 it  is	 not
    necessary  to  go  into the question  whether  there  was  a
    communication  of  the 'decision' of the government  to	 the
    petitioner.   The communication must be of a final  decision
    and not of a provisional or tentative decision. [285A-C]
    2.3. In	 any event the government could not  have  withdrawn
    from the acquisition under Section 48 of the Act inasmuch as
    the  Government had taken possession of the land.  Once	 the
    possession  of	the  land is taken it is  not  open  to	 the
    government  to	withdraw from the  acquisition.	  Admittedly
    possession was taken over by the Housing Board. (285D]
    2.4. The notification under S.4 need not necessarily  recite
    that  the land proposed to be acquired is waste	 or  arable.
    The non-recital does not vitiate the notification. [279C]
    2.5. Where a large extent of land is acquired, the existence
    of a few superstructures here and there does not prevent the
    Govt. from exercising the power under S.17(4). [277B]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. These appeals
are preferred against the judgment of the Full Bench of the Rajasthan High
Court allowing a batch of 16 special appeals. The special appeals were
preferred against the judgment of a learned Single Judge dismissing a batch of
24 writ petitions. The result of the judgment of the Full Bench is that the
notification issued by the Government of Rajasthan under Section 4(1) of the
Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act, 1953 proposing to acquire a large extent of
land stands quashed. The notification under Section 4(1) of the Rajasthan Act,
published in the Rajasthan Gazette dated 13.1.1982, proposed to acquire a
total extent of 2,.517 bighas (approximately equal to 1,580 crores) for the
benefit of the Rajasthan Housing Board. On 9.2.1982, another notification was
issued under Section 17(4) of the said Act dispensing with the provisions of
Section 5(A). On the same day, a declaration under Section 6 was also issued
in respect of the said area. According to the Government, the possession of
the land was also taken on 22nd and 24th of May, 1982. The validity of the
said notifications was questioned in the batch of writ petitions (being S.B.
Civil Writ Petition No. 707 of 1982 etc.) on three grounds viz., (i) that the
land acquired was not a waste or arable land inasmuch as there were pucca and
kutchha houses, huts and cattle sheds etc. On the said land. If so, the power
under sub-section (1) and sub-sec- tion (4) of Section 17 could not have been
invoked to dispense with the enquiry under Section 5(A); (ii) that there was
no real urgency warranting the invocation of urgency clause. An inquiry under
Section 5(A) ought to have been held, which is a valuable right given to the
land- owners whose land is acquired under the Act; and (iii) that at any rate
the houses and other structures on the land acquired should not have been
acquired.
The learned Judge rejected all the three contentions and dismissed the writ
petitions. Special appeals were preferred against the same which were heard by
a Division Bench in the first instance. The two learned Judges, N.M. Kasliwal
and K.S. Siddhu, JJ. differed in their opinions. Accordingly, the matter was
referred to a third Judge by an order dated 12.12.1983. Three questions were
framed for the consideration of third Judge viz., (1) whether it was necessary
for the Government to mention in the notification that the land is waste or
arable and whether the non-men-
274
tion of the said fact vitiates the notification; (2) whether it was obligatory
upon the Government to mention in the notification issued under Section 17(4)
that the land proposed to be acquired is waste or arable and whether the non-
mention thereof vitiates the said notification; and (3) "if a small fraction
of an arable land proposed to be acquired is occupied by buildings like huts,
kham houses and pucca houses for residential purposes and for keeping fodder,
cattle farms, cattle sheds and for similar other purposes, is it still
permissible to treat the entire land as arable land and issue notification
under Section 17(4) read with Section 17(1) of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition
Act, 1953? If not, what are the legal consequences which such buildings
aforementioned entail in the context of the said notification?' The third
Judge recorded his opinion on the said questions but when the matter went back
to the Division Bench, it was of the opinion that while the opinion of the
learned third Judge on questions 1 and 2 was categorical, affirming the view
of the learned Single Judge, his opinion on question No.3 was not clear or
categorical. Accordingly, the said question No.3 was referred to a Full Bench.
The Full Bench comprising N.M. Kasliwal, M.B. Sharma and Farooq Hasan, JJ.
heard the parties and held by a majority (Sharma and Farooq Hasan, JJ.) that
inasmuch as there were pucca and kutchha houses, cattle sheds etc. on a
fraction of a land proposed to be acquired and also because the notification
is not severable, the entire notification under Section 17(4) is liable to
fail. Accordingly, the declaration under Section 6 was also quashed. The
minority view was expressed by Kasliwal J. He was of the opinion that merely
because on a small portion of the land proposed to be acquired there were
pucca and kutchha houses, the invocation of power under Section 17(4) read
with Section 17(1) of the Act was not bad. The opinion of the majority Judges
is questioned in these appeals before us.
Sri Soli Sorabji, learned counsel for the appellant (State of Rajasthan)
submitted that the question considered by the Fun Bench of the High Court is
since concluded by a decision of this court in State of U.P. v. Smt. Pista
Devi, [1986] 4 S.C.C. 251 and, therefore, the appeals must be allowed
straightaway. On the other hand, S/Sri D.D. Thakur and S.K. Jain, learned
counsel for the respondent-writ petitioners submitted on the basis of the
decision in Sarju Prasad Saha v. The State of Uttar Pardesh, A.I.R. 1965 S.C.
1763 that once it is found that a portion of a land proposed to be 275
acquired is not waste or arable, the entire notification should fail inasmuch
as the notification is not severable. They also submitted that the decision in
Dom Phalauli v. State of Punjab and Ors., [1979] 4 S.C.C. 485 supports their
contention that the notification under Section 17(4) read with Section 17(1)
should itself expressly recite that the land in respect of which the said
power is being invoked is a waste or arable land and that non-recital of the
said fact vitiates the notification. The learned counsel also sought to argue
that there was no such urgency as to call for dispensing with the inquiry
under Section 5(A). They submitted that when a large chunk of land comprising
four villages was being acquired it was but fair and just that an inquiry
under Section 5(A) was held The construction of houses by Housing Board, it
was submitted, was not so urgent as to brook no delay and, therefore, the
invocation of urgency was not called for.
So far as the main question which was considered by the Fun Bench is
concerned,it is necessary to refer to the factual finding in the first
instance. Although the writ petitioners contended that there were pucca
houses, kham houses and huts used for residential purposes and also cattle
sheds, cattle-ponds and other structures, no clear material was placed before
the court. With the result that the Full Bench proceeded on the basis that
these structures were stituated only upon a fraction of a land sought to be
acquired. We may quote the following observation from the judgment of Sharma,
J. (majority opinion):
> "From the pleadings of the parties, it can also no longer be disputed that
> in the case of some of the appellants on fraction of this land kuchcha
> houses, kham houses and even some pucca constructions are situated which are
> being used by the appellants for tethering their cattle, storage of fodder
> and grain and also for residential purposes. It cannot be said as to out of
> the large area of 2570.15 bighas on what portion such constructions have
> been made, but in case of the appellants in each case they could be only on
> a fraction of the entire land sought to be acquired.
(emphasis added) The question is, whether in such a situation the majority
Judges of the Full Bench were right in holding that the notification under
Section 17(4) should fail.
276
In State of U.P. v. Smt. Pista Devi, a bench comprising E.S. Venkataramiah and
Khalid, JJ. considered an identical question. That case arose from Uttar
Pradesh where by way of a State amendment sub-section 1(A) was introduced in
Section 17. Paragraph 7 of the judgment brings out the ratio of the judgment
besides quoting the said State Amendment. It reads:
> "It was next contended that in the large extent of land Acquired which has
> about 412 acres there were some buildings here and there and so the
> acquisition of those parts of the land on which buildings were situated was
> unjustified since those portions were not either waste or arable lands which
> could be dealt with under Section 17(1) of the Act. This contention has not
> been considered by the High Court. We do not, however, find any substance in
> it. The government was not acquiring any property which was substantially
> covered by buildings. It acquired about 412 acres of land in the outskirts
> of Meerut city which was described as arable land by the Collector. It may
> be true that here and there were a few super-structures. In a case of this
> nature where a large extent of land is being acquired for planned
> development of the urban area it would not be proper to leave the small
> portions over which some super- structures have been constructed out of the
> development scheme. In such a situation where there is real urgency it would
> be difficult to apply Section 5-A of the Act in the case of few bits of land
> on which some structures are standing and to exempt the rest of the property
> from its application. Whether the land in question is waste or arable land
> has to be judged by looking at the general nature and condition of the land.
> It is not necessary in this case to consider any further legality or the
> propriety of the application of Section 17(1) of the Act to such portions of
> land proposed to be acquired, on which super-structures were standing
> because of the special provision which is inserted as sub- section (1-A) of
> Section 17 of the Act by the Land Acquisition (U.P. Amendment Act) (22 of
> 1954) which reads thus:
> (1-A) The power to take possession under sub- section (1) may also be
> exercised in the case of land other than waste or arable land, where the
> land is acquired for or in connection with  277 sanitary improvements of any
> kind or planned development."
We are of the opinion that the principle enunciated in the said paragraph is
the correct one and that the said principle is not really based upon sub-
section (1-A) of Section 17 introduced by U.P. State Amendment. Having
expressed a definite opinion that existence of a few super- structures here
and there, where a large extent of land is being acquired, does not prevent
the government from exercising the power under Section 17(4), the learned
Judge evolved the following test: "whether the land in question is waste or
arable has to be judged by looking at the general nature and condition of the
land.' Having so held, the learned Judges referred to the U.P. State Amendment
by way of an additional supporting ground. We are of the opinion that even
apart from the said State amendment, the principle enunciated in the said
decision is the correct one and is fully applicable here. Mr. Sorabji is,
therefore, right in contending that the said decision concludes the said issue
in these appeals.
The learned counsel for the respondents, however, submitted on the basis of
the decision in Sarju Prasad Saha v. The State of U.P. & Ors., A.I.R. 1965
S.C. 1763 that in such a situation the notification being not severable, the
entire notification should fail. We cannot agree. That was a converse case in
the sense that a major part of the land proposed to be acquired was covered by
buildings and constructions whereas only smaller part was waste or arable. It
is in such a case that the court opined that the notification cannot be held
to be partially good and partially bad. Accordingly, it was held, dispensing
with enquiry under Section 5(A) by invoking the urgency clause in Section
17(4) was bad. Paragraph (9) relied upon by the learned counsel may now be set
out. It reads:
> "One other point raised at the Bar may be briefly referred to. It was
> contended by Mr. S.P. Sinha appearing on behalf of the Municipal Board,
> Basti, that a part of the land notified for acquisition was waste or arable
> and in support of his contention, counsel referred us to certain revenue
> record. But if only a part of the land is waste or arable and the rest is
> not, a notification under S. 17(4) dispensing with compliance with the
> requirements of S. 5-A would be invalid. It would not be open to the Court
> to regard the notification as partially good and partially bad, for if the
> State had no power to dispense with the inquiry in respect of any part of
> the land notified under  278 S.4(1), an inquiry must be held under S.5-A
> giving an opportunity to persons interested in the land notified to raise
> their objections to the proposed acquisition and in that inquiry the persons
> interested cannot be restricted to raising objections in respect of land
> other than waste or arable land."
We don not think that in a case where only a fraction of a large extent of
land sought to be acquired is not waste or arable, the observations made in
the said judgment are applicable.
The counsel for the respondents then relied upon Dora Phalauli v. State of
Punjab & Ors., [1979] 4 S.C.C. 485 in support of their contention that the
notification under Section 17(4) should necessarily recite that the land
concerned is waste or arable land and that absence of such recital renders
the. notification invalid. The observations relied upon in the judgment of
N.L. Untwalia and A.P. Sen, JJ. read thus:
> "It is to be clearly understood that under sub-section (4), the appropriate
> Government may direct that the provisions of Section 5-A shall not apply
> where in the opinion of the State Government, the provisions of sub- section
> (1) or sub-section (2) are applicable, otherwise not. For making the
> provisions of sub-section (1) applicable, two things must be satisfied,
> firstly that the land in respect of which the urgency provision is being
> applied is waste or arable and secondly, that there is an urgency to proceed
> in the matter of taking immediate possession and so the right of the owner
> of the land for filing an objection under Section 5-A should not be made
> available to him. In the portion of the notification which we have extracted
> above, it is neither mentioned that the land is waste or arable nor has it
> been stated that in the opinion of the Government, there was any urgency to
> take recourse to the provisions of Section 17 of the Act. A direction to the
> Collector has been given to take action under Section 17 on the ground of
> urgency but this is not a legal and complete fulfillment of the requirement
> of the law. It is to be remembered that the right of a person having any
> interest in the property to file an objection under Section 5- A of the Act
> should not be interfered with in such a casual or cavalier manner as has
> been done in this case."
279
The learned Judges observed that the notification neither mentions that the
land is waste or arable nor does it mention that in the opinion of the
government there was urgency to take recourse to the provision of Section 17.
The decision is not really based upon the ground that the notification fails
to recite that the land is waste or arable. The paragraph read as a whole
shows that the learned Judges were impressed more by the fact that the
notification does not state that the government is of the opinion that it was
a case where the inquiry under Section 5-A ought to be dispensed with under
Section 17(4). It is in that context that they also pointed out that the
notification does not recite that the land is waste or arable. Section 17(4)
does not require that notification itself should recite the fact that the land
concerned is waste or arable. In such a situation there is no basis for the
respondent's contention that the notification should itself recite the said
fact nor does the said decision support their contention.
Sri Thakur further argued that the construction of houses by Housing Board is
not of such urgency as to call for the invocation of the said power. We are
not satisfied. Firstly, on this question the decision of the Rajasthan High
Court is against the writ petitioners. The learned Single Judge negatived it
as well as Division Bench following the opinion of the third Judge. Secondly,
we are satisfied that there was material before the government in this case
upon which it could have and did form the requisite opinion that it was a case
calling for exercise of power under Section 17(4). The learned Single Judge
has referred to the material upon which the government had formed the said
opinion. The material placed before the Court disclosed that the government
found, on due verification, that there was an acute scarcity of land and there
was heavy pressure for construction of houses for weaker sections and middle
income group people; that the Housing Board had obtained a loan of Rs. 16
crores under a time-bound programme to construct and utilise the said amount
by 31.3.1983; that in the circumstances the Government was satisfied that
unless possession was taken immediately, and the Housing Board permitted to
proceed with the construction, the Board will not be able to adhere to the
time-bound programme. In addition to the said fact, the Division Bench
referred to certain other material also upon which the government had formed
the said satisfaction viz., that in view of the time- bound programme
stipulated by the lender, HUDCO, the Board had already appointed a large
number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work
and that holding an inquiry under Section 5-A would have resulted in uncalled
280 for delay endangering the entire scheme and time-schedule of the Housing
Board. It must be remembered that the satisfaction under Section 17(4) is a
subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the government
could have formed the said satisfaction fairly, the court would not interfere
nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority. This is the
principle affirmed by decisions of this court not only under Section 17(4) but
also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction. For the above reasons,
the appeals are allowed and the judgment of the Full Bench of the Rajasthan
High Court impugned herein as set aside. Having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.
WITH PETITION (C) NO. 290 OF 1989 This writ petition is preferred by the New
Pink Grih Nirman Sahkari Sangh questioning the very same notification which
were questioned in the writ petitions filed in Rajasthan High Court and which
have given rise to the aforementioned Civil Appeals. It was admitted because
of the pendency of the above appeals and was directed to be heard alongwith
them. In the writ petition, several reliefs are asked for viz., quashing of
the notification under Section 4(1), quashing of the notification under
Section 17(1), quashing of the notification under section 17(4) as well as the
declaration under Section 6. It is prayed that the acquisition proceedings
must be declared to have been withdrawn by virtue of the order of the Hon'ble
Housing Minister of Rajasthan dated 20th July, 1984. Before us, however, Sri
D.D. Thakur, learned counsel for the petitioner urged only one contention
viz., that by virtue of the decision of the Minister in-charge of Urban
Development, Government of Rajasthan and the Chief Minister dated 8.2.1990 the
Rajasthan Government must be held to have withdrawn from the said acquisition
proceedings within the meaning of Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
in so far as the lands purchased by the petitioner-society are concerned. For
a proper appreciation of this contention, it is necessary to notice the
relevant facts and circumstances in their sequence.
The notification under section 4(1) was published on 12.1.1982. On 9.2.1982,
the notification under section 17(4) and the declaration under section 6 were
issued. According to the government, possession was also 281 taken of the
entire extent of land on 22nd and 24th of May, 1982\.
The petitioner-cooperative society which claims to have purchased about 525
bighas of land from the khatedars represented to the Government to de-notify
the land purchased by them. On the basis of the said representation, the then
Minister in-charge of Urban Development took a decision on 20.7.1984 to
release the lands but he was over- ruled by the then Chief Minister Sri
Harideo Joshi on 29.4.1985. The decision of the Chief Minister has also been
placed before us. This issue lay dormant till 1990. On 27.1.1990, general
elections were announced. Polling was to take place on 27.2.1990. It is at
this stage that a sudden urgency appears to have developed in this matter
again. The petitioner-society made a representation on 6.2.1990 to the
Minister for Urban Development to de-notify the lands purchased by them. The
Minister for Urban Development recommended de-notification which was approved
by the Chief Minister Sri Harideo Joshi on 8.2.1990. It was signed by the
Minister concerned on 13.2.1990.
The recommendation put up by the Urban Development Minister for the
consideration of the Chief Minister stated the following facts: The
petitioner-society had entered into agreements of sale in 1974-75 and 1975-76
for purchasing a substantial extent of land for developing the Indira Bihar
Residential Scheme and had also allotted plots to its three thousand members
during the years 1976 to 1981. The society had deposited Rs. 50,000 as sub-
division charges according to rules in the year 1981 with the Urban
Improvement Trust and had initiated proceedings for technical approval of the
scheme in the same year. The society had also deposited a sum of Rs. 9 lakhs
towards conversion of the land (from agricultural to urban land) in the office
of the Additional Collector, Land Conversion in March, 1982 under the Land
Conversion Rules, 1981. The Housing Board had actually started the proceedings
for acquisition and the acquisition notifications were issued in January, 1982
i.e., after the society had taken the above steps. The petitioner-society had
obtained a stay order against the acquisition proceed- ings and that as in
1990, the stay granted by the Supreme Court was in force. On 18.1.1990, the
State Government had taken a policy decision to regularise and de-acquire the
lands under acquisition covered by schemes of the Housing Cooperative
Societies on payment of prescribed amount. The said policy may be applied to
the petitioner-society. As far as the question of exemption 282 from urban
land ceiling is concerned, all the plot holders of this society, like other
societies, will hand over their plots to the Jaipur Land Authority and it
shall be deemed to be the government land but will be re-allotted to the same
plot holders after charging the fixed price and development charges on
prescribed terms. This procedure is being followed by Jaipur Development
Authority in other matters as well. In this way, the problem of exemption from
the urban land ceiling would also be solved. The final recommendation was:
'looking to the aforesaid facts it is desirable to direct to de-acquire that
land of the scheme under the provisions of section 48 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 and regularise the scheme because this society is fulfilling the
same public purpose of housing by starting proceedings for which the Housing
Board wants to acquire this land later on for this purpose."
The above recommendation was accepted by the Chief Minister on 8.2.1990 as
stated hereinbefore. It appears that the matter again came before the Hon'ble
Chief Minister on 23.2.1990 when he approved a note, the latter half of which
reads as follows: "Therefore, it will be in the interest of broad public
interest that this land of the society be regularised according to the
decision of Cabinet after releasing it from acquisition, as is the opinion of
Honourable Minister Incharge Local Self Govt, and Housing Minister. As far as
the question of Scheduled Caste/Tribes land is concerned, in this respect the
Government has already taken a decision much before, according to which the
proceedings are to be taken." Evidently, in pursuance of the aforesaid
decision, the Deputy Secretary, Urban Development and Housing Department,
Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur ad- dressed the following letter to the
secretary, Rajasthan Housing Board, Jaipur:
"RAJASTHAN GOVERNMENT URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING DEPARTMENT No. F. 5(3)
UDH/92 DATED 24.4.90.
Secretary, Rajasthan Housing Board, Jaipur.
Sub:- In the matter of De-acquisition of land of Indira Bihar Scheme Sahkari
Samiti situated in village Devri, Sukhalpura, Jhalana Chaur, and Goliyabas.
283
Sir, In respect of the above subject it has been directed by the State Govt.
that a decision to release the aforesaid land of the Society from acquisition
has been taken. It has been brought to the notice of the State Government that
some improvement has been done by you on the land covered by this scheme.
Therefore, kindly intimate as to what development works have been performed by
you on the land covered by the aforesaid scheme of the society and how much
expenditure has been incurred by the Housing Board in it. Please send the full
particulars to the State Govt. immediately also inform as to at what stage the
matter is going in the courts without delay. Now so far as possible do not
make any development works further on this land. Intimate as to whether
possession of the land has been taken or not. Before restoring the possession
to the society the amount of development charges will have to be returned
back, therefore, send the valuation within three days. Conversion charges will
be payable according to the rules. The copies of the orders of the court may
also be sent.
Yours faithfully, sd/ Dy. Secretary.' A copy of the said letter was also
marked to the petitioner society as would be evident from the endorsement at
the foot of the said letter which reads:
"No. F. 5(3) UDB/90 Dated: 29.2.90 Copy to the secretary, New Pink City Grah
Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd., Bapu Bazar, Jaipur for information. He may kindly
intimate as to within what period of time the amount of Development charges
and cost of land etc. will be deposited.
sd/ Dy. Secretary to the Govt.
28.2.90"
284
The learned counsel for the writ petitioners stops here and says that the
above proceedings constitute a definite and final decision to de-notify and
de-acquire the lands and that nothing more was required to be done to
constitute withdrawal from acquisition within the meaning of section
48\. Sri F.S. Nariman, the learned counsel appearing for the government of
Rajasthan, however, filed an additional affidavit setting out the developments
subsequent to the aforesaid letter dated 24.2.1990 which may now be noticed.
The additional affidavit is sworn to by the Secretary, Rajasthan Housing
Board, Sri M.K.Khanna. It is stated that in response to the aforesaid letter
dated 24.2.1990, the Rajasthan Housing Board represented to the Government
that the land should not be de-notified whereupon the Secretary, urban
Development and Housing ordered the stopping of the issuance of notification
for de-acquisition of the land of the petitioner society on 25.5.1990.
(Meanwhile, a new Government represented by a different political party had
come into power). The order of the secretary dated 25.5.1990 is filed as Ann.
X-1 to the additional affidavit. It is further submitted that at no time any
notification was issued withdrawing from the acquisition. It is further stated
that on 13.12.1990 the then Chief Minister referred the entire matter
pertaining to de-acquisition of petitioner's land to the Beri Commission for
report. The said commission was constituted to look into illegalities and
irregularities committed by the functionaries and officials of the previous
government. The Beri Commission reported that the decision to de-acquire the
lands of the petitioner-society was in contravention of the earlier decision
of the Cabinet, contrary to law and against public interest. The commission
stated that the said decision was the result of the influence brought upon the
concerned Minister by the petitioner- society and is not a fair decision. The
Chief Minister also acted under the influence and pressure of the petitioner-
society and, therefore, his decision too is not a proper one. Accepting the
said report, the government intimated the Rajasthan Housing Board that there
is no question of de-acquiring the said land. The letter dated 24.4.1990 was
also formally withdrawn on 31.10.1991. It is also stated in the said
additional affidavit that the Khatedars from whom the society claimed to have
purchased the said land under agreements of sale, have by separate letters
intimated the Secretary, Rajasthan Housing Board and the Land Acquisition
Collector as far back as 5th April, 1982 that they had no objection to the
acquisition of their lands. They asked for compensation @ Rs. 40,000/ per
bigha.
285
From the above material it is clear that there was no final decision at any
time to de-notify the said lands. A tentative decision was no doubt taken in
February, 1990 but before it could be implemented the government thought it
necessary to ascertain the views of the Housing Board and to find out as to
what the Board had done upon the land, what structures it had raised and what
amount it had spent so that the Board could be compensated while delivering
the possession back to the Housing society. Before this could be done there
was a change in the government and the said tentative decision was reversed.
In this view of the matter, it is not necessary for us to go into the question
whether there was a communication of the 'decision' of the government to the
petitioner. The communication must be of a final decision and not of a
provisional or tentative decision.
We are of the further opinion that in any event the government could not have
withdrawn from the acquisition under section 48 of the Act inasmuch as the
Government had taken possession of the land. Once the possession of the land
is taken it is not open to the government to withdraw from the acquisition.
The very letter dated 24.2.1990 relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner
recites that 'before restoring the possession to the society the amount of
development charges will have to be returned back............. This shows
clearly that possession was taken over by the Housing Board. Indeed the very
tenor of the letter is, asking the Housing Board as to what development work
they had carried out on the land and how much expenditure they had incurred
thereon, which could not have been done unless the Board was in possession of
the land. The Housing Board was asked to send the full particulars of the
expenditure and not to carry on any further development works on that land.
Reading the letter as a whole, it cannot but be said that the possession of
the land was taken by the government and was also delivered to the Housing
Board. Since the possession of the land was taken, there could be no question
of withdrawing from the acquisition under section 48 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894\.
For the above reasons, the writ petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
    G.N.				   Appeals allowed.
    				 Petition dismissed.
