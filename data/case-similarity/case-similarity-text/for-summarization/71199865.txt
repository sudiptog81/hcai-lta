Act is required to be entertained when the Arbitral Tribunal is already
continued by the parties and the applicant has taken recourse to remedy under
Section 17 of the Act, so as to treat the said remedy under Section 17 of the
Act to be not efficacious; whether in the facts of the case, such
circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under Section 17
efficacious - is the moot question for consideration.

sought to invoke Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Arbitration Act'), to seek interim measures
till the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings between the parties, which

executed by him on behalf of partnership firm between the period from 10th
February, 2015 to 26th February, 2016.
2.2 It is to be stated at the outset that the present applicant had earlier
filed an Application No.119 of 2016 under Section 9 of the Act before the City
Civil Court for similar relief. The applicant appears to have in the meantime,
initiated other proceedings under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act before
the Apex Court for appointment of Presiding Arbitrator, in which proceedings,
the Supreme Court passed order dated 24th April, 2017 and held the present
arbitration to be an international commercial arbitration. In this view, the
present Application is now filed before this Court under Section 9 of the
Arbitration Act.
3\. A Limited Liability Partnership was set up between the respondent Nos.1
and 2 pursuant to agreement dated 10th February, 2015. The present applicant

the valuation of the Firm was Rs.05.00 lakhs only wherein amount of Rs.02.25

resident Indian based in country of Oman, stated that when in the month of
December, 2014 he had come to India upon being invited by his business
associates, the applicant came in contact with respondent No.1. It is the case
of the applicant that respondent No.1 painted a rosy picture of him as the
owner of business empire and that he had large stake in the business company
Kinetrics. According to the applicant, he was unaware about the actual
financial capacity and credibility of respondent No.1 and the Limited

February, 2015\.

of the firm without knowledge of the applicant and other partners through fund
transfer and cash withdrawals from the account of the firm. Several
commissions and omissions were alleged against respondent No.1 to be contrary
to the agreement of LLP. It was also alleged by the applicant that respondent
No.2 who was one of the founding partners started to connive with respondent
No.1 and resorted to malicious conduct against the interests of the firm as
well as of the applicant. It was alleged that only money which came to the
firm was the sum of Rs.45.00 crores contributed by the applicant, besides the
initial contribution of Rs.05.00 lakhs made by the other Partners. In the
memorandum of application averments are made to allege as to how the funds
were misused or siphoned off to the detriment of the financial interest of the

JUDGMENT firm. It was alleged that respondent No.1 in collusion with
respondent No.2 siphoned off large amount of Rs.21.18 crores. In this order,

3.1.3 Respondent No.1 came to be expelled as Partner from the firm by

2016 under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act before the Commercial Court being
the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, seeking directions against respondent No.1

No.111 of 2016 which was filed by respondent No.1, respondent No.2 opted to

respondent No.2, applicant filed application under Section 340 of the Code of

(v) Application under Section 9 of the respondent No.1 being Civil

Leave Petition came to be dismissed by the Apex Court.
3.3 Respondent Nos.1 and 2 had in response to the nomination of arbitrator by
the applicant as above, had appointed a retired Chief Justice of the Bombay
High Court as their nominee arbitrator. This nominee arbitrator withdrew
himself from arbitration  Page 7 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST
2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT proceedings on or around 16th January, 2017.
applicant called upon on 17th January, 2017 respondent No.1 to appoint another
co-arbitrator. On 16th February, 2017 respondent No.1 appointed a retired
Judge of the Supreme Court as co-arbitrator. Arbitrator nominated by the
applicant and arbitrator nominated by respondent No.1 failed to appoint the
Presiding Arbitrator within the stipulated period of 30 days.
3.3.1 Therefore, the applicant filed application under Section 11 of the Act
before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court by order dated 24th July, 2017 in
Arbitration Petition No.14 of 2017 appointed retired Judge of the Supreme
Court as the Presiding Arbitrator. It was in the said order dated 24 th July,
2017 that the arbitration was considered as international commercial
arbitration by the Apex Court. Thus, the Atbitral Tribunal stood constituted
with three members as above. It began hearing of the arbitration proceedings
holding its first meeting on 29th August, 2017.
3.3.2 On the same day of the first hearing, that is on 29th August, 2017, the
applicant - claimant moved an application for interim protection before the
Arbitral Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act. Thereunder the applicant -
claimant asked for various reliefs against respondent Nos.1 and 2. These
reliefs were similar to one prayed in the present application under Section 9.
Thereafter following pleadings were filed before the Arbitral Tribunal - (i)
Application under Section 17 of the Act filed by the Claimant  Page 8 of 38
Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT along
with documents, (ii) Additional documents in support of the Section 17
application filed by the Claimant, (iii) Statement of Claim along with
supporting documents filed by the Claimant, (iv) Application under Section 17
of the Act filed by the Respondent No.2, which the Respondent No.2 also sought
to be treated as his reply to the Claimant's Section 17 application, (v)
Documents in support of the Respondent No. 2's Section 17 application filed by
the Respondent No. 2, (vi) Reply to Claimant's Section 17 application filed by
the Respondent No. 1 along with certain documents and (vii) Reply to the
Claimant's Statement of Claim filed by the Respondent No. 2.
3.3.3 Thus, application under Section 17 was filed by the applicant before the
Arbitral Tribunal and respondent No.1 had also filed his Section 17
application separately. There were two applications under Section 17 by
different parties before the Arbitral Tribunal and the replies therein were
filed.
3.3.4 applicant has stated that hearings in the arbitration took place on 29th
August, 2017, 03rd October, 2017, 15th October, 2017, 22nd October, 2017 and
23rd October, 2017 and the arguments on the applicant - claimant's application
under Section 17 were heard by the Arbitral Tribunal. The tribunal had
reserved pronouncement of the order in the said Section 17 application. At
this stage, the Presiding Arbitrator who was appointed by the Supreme Court by
order dated 24th April, 2017, by e-mail communication  Page 9 of 38 Downloaded
on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT dated 11th
November, 2017 expressed his inability to continue in the arbitration
proceedings.
3.3.5 As the co-arbitrators failed to decide on the appointment of Presiding
Arbitrator, applicant approached the Supreme Court. By order dated 04th
December, 2017 the Apex Court appointed another retired Judge of the Supreme
Court as new Presiding Arbitrator. It may be stated that against the Presiding
Arbitrator who came to be appointed by aforesaid order dated 04th December,
2017 by the Supreme Court, the applicant made allegations at the subsequent
stages by addressing letter dated 28th November, 2018, the details of which
are referred to hereinafter. By order dated 10th December, 2017, the re-
constituted Arbitral Tribunal set out a time-table for rehearnig of the
application under Section 17 filed by the applicant.
3.3.6 Noticeably, on 02nd November, 2018 applicant
\- claimant's application under Section 17 of the Act was heard and order was
reserved by the Arbitral Tribunal. In the subsequent meetings which were
scheduled on 17th, 18th and 19th December, cross- examination of claimant's
witness named one Shri Colonel R.K. Singh was mid-way. Soon thereafter on 28th
November, 2018 the applicant - claimant addressed the aforementioned letter
making allegations against members of then constituted tribunal, which led to
withdrawal by co-arbitrator and the Presiding Arbitrator.
3.3.7 On 24th January, 2019 Shri Andre Yeap, the  Page 10 of 38 Downloaded on
: Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT nominee arbitrator
of the applicant addressed a letter to Shri Vinayak Pradhan requesting said
Mr.Pradhan on behalf of himself as well as the other co-arbitrator Honourable
Mr.Justice G.T. Nanavati (Retd.) to act as Presiding Arbitrator. Said Shri
Vinayak Pradhan on the very day, that is on 24th January, 2019, accepted the
appointment as Presiding Arbitrator.
3.3.8 It was on 25th January, 2019 that the present application came to be
filed before this Court for interim measures of protection under Section 9 of
the Act, which was registered on 28 th January, 2019.
3.4 Figures on the record of the present application (Annexure-P54, Page 779),
detailed letter dated 28th November, 2018 addressed by advocate of the
applicant - claimant to the three members of the Arbitral Tribunal. In this
letter, insinuations and tacit, if not direct, allegations came to be made
against the Presiding Arbitrator - the Honourable Judge of the Supreme Court
(Retd.) who was appointed by the Supreme Court on 04th December, 2017. The
contents of the said letter are mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs in
details.
3.4.1 In the aforementioned letter dated 28th November, 2018, the applicant -
claimant in the former part narrated the history of the arbitration and the
constitution of Arbitral Tribunal, that the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted
on 24th July, 2017 as per the order passed by the Apex Court in  Page 11 of 38
Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT
Arbitration Petition No.14 of 2017, wherein Honourable Judge of the Supreme
Court (Retd.) was appointed as Presiding Arbitrator whereas the two other
Honourable Judges (Retd.) of the Supreme Court were the co-arbitrators. It was
stated that respondent Nos.1 and 2 previously filed Civil Miscellaneous
Application No.119 of 2016 before the City Civil Court under Section 9 of the
Arbitration Act, which was withdrawn and subsequently application under
Section 17 came to be filed by respondent Nos.1 and 2, that this application
was heard extensively during the month of October, 2017 and Tribunal reserved
its order on 25th October, 2017 in that application under Section 17 of the
Act. It was stated that soon after the then Presiding Arbitrator resigned from
the Tribunal, that thereafter the Supreme Court appointed on 04th December,
2017 another Presiding Arbitrator who was another Honourable Judge of the
Supreme Court (Retd.), and that the new Presiding Arbitrator set down time-
table for hearing of the applicant's application under Section 17 of the Act.
However, according to the applicant, long date was given.
3.4.2 It was next stated by the applicant that respondent No.1 wanted to
secure Rs.17.00 crores procuring certain parcels of land in favour of the
firm, and that despite claimant's objections, the Tribunal permitted
respondent No.1 to take necessary steps to procure land parcels in the name of
the firm and to secure such amount. It was suggested by the claimant in
paragraph 15 of the said communication  Page 12 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun
30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT dated 28th November, 2018
that, "It is also noteworthy that the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have used any
and all means to delay adjudication of Claimant's Section 17 Application and
main arbitral proceedings as well". It was alleged that respondent Nos.1 and 2
sought time and further stated in paragraph 16 that, "However, this Hon'ble
Tribunal was not able to prevent the Respondent No. 1 from delaying and
protracting the arbitration proceedings ... ... ...", and further that
"Hon'ble Tribunal did not give any directions to the Respondent No. 1 and just
spent the said two months awaiting response of the Respondent No.1". It was
thereafter sought to be stated by the applicant that parcels of land which the
respondent No.1 wanted to bring in for the firm was much less in value than
Rs.17.00 crores as suggested. The applicant in clever language suggested that
even after detailed arguments addressed by the parties, Tribunal took
cognizance of frivolous and dilatory e- mail from respondent No.2. It was
thereby sought to be suggested that the Arbitral Tribunal was a participant in
prolonging the proceedings.
3.4.3 After narrating the events and making indirect suggestion against
functioning of the Tribunal and alleging that hearing of Section 17
applications was being delayed, the applicant - claimant adverted to
allegations about personal incapacity etc. of the Presiding Arbitrator. It was
stated in paragraph 24 of the letter by the applicant thus, "By this time, it
became apparent to the Claimant that the Presiding Arbitrator was  Page 13 of
38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT
unfortunately not keeping well and was unable to recollect arguments etc....".
Since learned Presiding Arbitrator, due to ill-health, did not recollect the
arguments heard on claimant's Section 17 application, the matter was
effectively re-heard on merits at length and the order was again reserved on
02nd November, 2018.
3.4.4 It was stated that the time limit of the arbitral award to be rendered
by the Tribunal was 12 months, which expired on 05th December, 2018; however,
the Tribunal had failed to adjudicate the claimant's application under Section
17 of the Act. It was alleged that the Tribunal had been acting in favour of
respondent Nos.1 and 2, as stated in paragraph 27 of the letter thus, "The
main arbitration proceedings have been delayed due to unfair leniency by the
Hon'ble Tribunal towards the Respondent Nos. 1 & 2 wherein several
opportunities have been granted to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to file their
respective pleadings without there being any sufficient ground for such
indulgence as also by entertaining repeated adjournment requests at almost
every pre-scheduled hearing.". The applicant further made suggestive
allegations against the Tribunal, the relevant sentence is reproduced from
paragraph 28 of the letter - "This long delay has been compounded by the
situation that the Hon'ble Tribunal has been unable to enforce its directions
issued against Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 from time to time and adhere to the
schedule fixed by the Tribunal itself only because of the unnecessary leniency
shown by the Hon'ble  Page 14 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST
2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT Tribunal to the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, who
are being treated with obvious preference and to their advantage.".
3.4.5 It was alleged that the Presiding Arbitrator gave long dates and was
prolonging the hearing of the decision on application under Section 17 which
was made by the applicant. The Arbitral Tribunal was giving unequal treatment
to respondent Nos.1 and 2 and had been acting to their advantage. On the basis
of such bare allegations, it was sought to be suggested by the applicant that
due to such functioning of the Tribunal, his application under Section 17 of
the Act did not culminate. It was sought to be argued by the applicant that
due to all such things, remedy under Section 17 of the Act already availed by
the applicant before the Arbitral Tribunal had become inefficacious.
3.4.6 It was thereafter stated by the applicant that the Tribunal had failed
to dispense justice in fair manner. The applicant - claimant did not give his
consent for extension of time period for the Arbitral Tribunal as contemplated
under Section 29(A) (3) of the Act. In the backdrop and on the premise of the
contents of the letter, the insinuation and allegations, direct or indirect,
applicant devoted paragraphs 32 to 36 in the letter under the head "Presiding
Arbitrator's Inability to Act" and stated that the Presiding Arbitrator should
consider himself to be withdrawn from the arbitration proceedings as Presiding
Arbitrator in view of what is stated by the  Page 15 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun
Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT claimant.
3.5 The respondents would indeed emphatically and categorically submit that
all the allegations on the conduct and capacity of the Arbitral Tribunal and
in respect of the Presiding Arbitrator, were unsubstantiated, unsupported by
any material and they were only paper-deep statements which were the
insinuations and indirect or direct allegations made against the Presiding
Arbitrator for the sake of making, who was a person with all time integrity,
commitment and discipline.
3.6 While the aforesaid letter was addressed on 28th November, 2018, it
attracted immediate reaction from one of the co-arbitrators, who was nominee
of the applicant. The co-arbitrator by letter dated 29th November, 2018
tendered his resignation and withdrew from the Tribunal with immediate effect.
It referred to contents of letter dated 28th November, 2018 to state that the
allegations were against the whole Tribunal.
3.7 The conduct on part of the applicant in addressing the aforesaid letter
dated 28th November, 2018 and his indulgence in making insinuations and
allegations, direct and indirect, on the Arbitral Tribunal in general and
against the Presiding Arbitrator in particular, led to a sharp reaction from
learned Presiding Arbitrator - Honourable Judge of the Supreme Court (Retd.).
The Presiding Arbitrator addressed letter dated 01st December, 2018  Page 16
of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT
to deal with and deny all the direct and indirect insinuations and allegations
made against him by the applicant in his aforesaid letter. The reply of the
Presiding Arbitrator dated 01st December, 2018 is on record of this
proceedings (Annexure-P56, Page 792).
3.7.1 The Presiding Arbitrator's reply communication dated 01st December, 2018
specifically denied all the wanton allegations sought to be levelled by the
applicant. It was stated that the applicant might be in habit of making
baseless statements and allegations to get the order in his favour. It was
stated that, "Be sure that such baseless statements and allegations would not
count much before the Tribunal consisting of three retired Judges of the
Honourable supreme Court". All the allegations were denied. The repetition of
contents of the denial is not considered necessary. The Presiding Arbitrator
ultimately showed his disinclination to continue and withdrew from the
arbitration.
3.7.2 Followed thereafter another communication dated 03rd December, 2018 by
the applicant addressed to the Presiding Arbitrator stating that highlighted
in their earlier letter dated 28th November, 2018 (i) the conduct of
respondent Nos.1 and 2 and the unequal treatment being meted out to respondent
Nos.1 and 2 to their advantage in the arbitration proceedings and
(ii) the general health condition and concerns regarding the same, to further
state that the Tribunal had ceased to exist and no further order be  Page 17
of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT
passed by the Tribunal in absence of the Presiding Arbitrator who had
resigned. It was stated that the applicant had taken steps for reconstitution
of the Arbitral Tribunal. The papers of the arbitral proceedings were
collected back.
3.8 Thereafter ensued correspondence dated 04th December, 2018, 15th December,
2018 and 26th December, 2018 between the Presiding Arbitrator's office who had
resigned, and the applicant for return of the papers of the arbitral
proceedings. The Presiding Arbitrator returned all the arbitration papers to
the applicant.
3.8.1 In communication dated 26th December, 2018 mentioned above which was by
the applicant to the continuing co-arbitrator, it was sought to be pointed out
by the applicant that his nominee arbitrator had resigned from the proceedings
on 28th November, 2018 and that the Presiding Arbitrator had also withdrawn
from the arbitral proceedings with effect from 01st December, 2018. The
applicant stated in his letter about the said order to state that "the
purported "proposed reasoned order" has no sanctity in the eyes of law and any
attempt to give effect to such a "proposed reasoned order" will only give
greedance to and substantiate the contents of the applicant- claimant's letter
dated 28.11.2018".
3.8.2 In the very letter dated 26th November, 2018, the applicant stated that
for the purpose of reconstitution of the Arbitral Tribunal the requisite steps
were already taken as stated in letter dated  Page 18 of 38 Downloaded on :
Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT 03rd December, 2018
and that the applicant - claimant had nominated one Mr.Andre Yeap, SC as his
nominee arbitrator in the present arbitral proceedings. It was stated that the
respondents and their respective advocates were also sent a communication in
this regard.
3.8.3 It may be recollected here that the draft order was already issued by
the team of two Arbitrators in respect of applicant's application under

4\. Heard learned senior advocate Mr.Shalin Mehta with learned advocate
Mr.Parth Contractor for the applicant, learned advocate Mr.G.H. Virk for
respondent No.1, learned senior advocate Mr.Nirupam Nanavaty with learned
advocate Mr.Himanshu Desai for respondent No.2, learned advocate Mr.M.N.
Marfatia for respondent No.3 and learned advocate Mr.P.M. Buch for respondent
No.4.
4.1 Learned senior advocate for the applicant, in order to press the prayers,
extensively relied on the averments made in the application to submit that the
respondents had acted to the detriment of the firm and that the funds were
wasted and siphoned off. It was submitted that the respondents brought money
in the firm to the extent of Rs.05.00 lakhs whereas applicant brought Rs.45.00
crores. Learned senior advocate referred to the bank accounts, remittance
notes, transfer notes, letter of the bank etc., seeking to emphasise that the
applicant had brought  Page 19 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST
2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT in more than Rs.45.00 crores for the firm. He
then submitted that there were illegal transfers and withdrawals by the
respondents in favour of their family members. applicant alleged that all
those acts amounted to tinkering with the funds of the firm. He sought to rely
on the judgment in First Appeal No.668 of 2017 dated 04th May, 2017. It was
further sought to be alleged in the submission that circuitous transactions
had taken place at the behest of respondent No.1.
4.1.1 Learned senior advocate next submitted that the Memorandum of
Understandings in respect of lands were bogus and did not fulfill the basic
essentials of contract. He also submitted that though the parcels of lands
were offered as security by respondent No.1 during hearing of Section 17
application before the Arbitral Tribunal, the lands offered was useless and
could not stand as security and that it was not commensurate with the amounts
embezzled by the respondents. It was submitted that the land was not properly
valued and respondent No.1 had not provided to the Arbitral Tribunal the
details about the land valuer.
4.1.2 Learned senior advocate for the applicant relied on judgments of
Calcutta High Court in Bishnu Kumar Yadav v. M/s. M.L. Soni [2016 SCC Online
Cal 1420, more particularly paragraphs 6, 16 and 17 thereof] as well as in
SREI Equipment Finance Limited v. Ray Infra Services Private Limited [2016 SCC
Online Calcutta 6765] in which it was observed that  Page 20 of 38 Downloaded
on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT the Court might
entertain an application for interim relief after the constitution of a
Arbitral Tribunal if the Court finds that the circumstances exist which might
not rendered the remedy provided under Section 17 of the Act to be
efficacious. A Kerala High Court decision in M. Ashram v. Kasim V.K. [2018 SCC
Online Kerala 4913] was pressed into service, in which the question addressed
by that High Court was whether an application under Section 9(1)(ii) of the
Act was maintainable seeking an interim measure for protection after passing
the award by the Tribunal. By pressing into service decision of the Delhi High
Court in NGC Network India Private Limited v. Orangefish Entertainment Private
Limited being OMP No.326 of 2018 decided on 18th September, 2018 wherein it
was held on the facts of that case that delay and lack of knowledge about the
constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal provided sufficient ground to the
applicant to approach with application under Section 9 and in the facts of
that case, bar under Section 9(3) of the Act would not apply, it was submitted
that the present application is required to be entertained though application
under Section 17 of the Act is filed before the Arbitral Tribunal.
4.2 On behalf of respondent No.1, affidavit-in- reply came to be filed in the
present proceedings, it was highlighted that as on the date, the Arbitral
Tribunal comprising of the Presiding Arbitrator one Shri Vinayak Pradhan and
co-arbitrators comprising of the Honourable Retired Judge of the Supreme Court
and one Mr.Andre Yeap was continued and was in existence.
Page 21 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV
JUDGMENT
It was contended that Section 9(3) envisages that application under Section 9
would not be entertained unless the Court is of the view that the remedy under
Section 17 was not efficacious. It was further pointed out by annexing the
e-mail correspondence exchanged between the arbitrators, the parties and their
advocates between 24th Jaunary, 2019 to 25th February, 2019 that the Arbitral
Tribunal was constituted and had gone in existence.
4.2.1 It was contended on behalf of respondent No.1 that in narrating the
events and raising pleadings in the application, the applicant had placed a
convenient version of facts far from correct, which again suffered from vice
of suggestio falsi and suppressio veri. It was submitted that the Tribunal
consisting of two Honourable Judges of the Supreme Court (Retd.) and
Honourable Supreme Court Judge (Retd.) as Presiding Arbitrator had to disband
itself due to applicant's conduct, who realised that his false case was
exposed in the proceedings of Section 17 application and that the relief
prayed for therein was on the verge of rejection in view of the witnesses'
depositions and cross-examination. It was the case of respondent No.1 that the
allegations levelled by the applicant against the Presiding Arbitrator by
addressing letter dated 28th November, 2018 were motivated and self-serving to
a desired end.
4.2.2 Respondent No.1 quoted the denial of the Presiding Arbitrator contained
in his letter dated  Page 22 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST
2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT 01st December, 2018 extracting as under, by
pinpointing that the Presiding Arbitrator, who was an Honourable Judge of the
Supreme Court (Retd.) and always-and-all-the-time-above board person was drawn
into allegations levelled against him by the applicant who himself became
unethical in making allegations to serve the self-interests, bringing to
disrepute the whole dispute resolving process of arbitration. "It appears that
it might be your habit to make such baseless statements and allegations to get
the order in your client's favour. Be sure that such baseless statements and
allegations would not count much before the Tribunal consisting of three
retired Judges of the Supreme Court. It is, therefore, quite possible that
because of such behaviour, ex-Presiding Arbitrator, .... (Former Judge,
Supreme Court of India) was required to withdraw his consent to continue as
Presiding Arbitrator."
4.2.3 It was submitted by respondent No.1 that application under Section 17
filed by the applicant before the Arbitral Tribunal was already decided by
reasoned order signed and passed by majority members of the Arbitral Tribunal.
It was stated that it was decided below applicant's application dated 29th
August, 2017 which was not produced and suppressed from this Court in the
memorandum of the present application and the list of documents. It was
contended that once the order on the application under Section 17 of the
applicant was passed and the said proceedings were decided, it was a
suppression  Page 23 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019
C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT going to the root of the matter and that the
present application is therefore, an attempt to revive Section 17 application
already decided as above. In paragraphs 8 onwards of the affidavit, respondent
No.1 also dealt with merits to refute the case of the applicant.
4.3 Affidavit-in-reply came to be filed by respondent No.2 also raising a
submission that the majority members of the Arbitral Tribunal had passed a
reasoned order on the application under Section 17 of the Act preferred by the
applicant before the Arbitral Tribunal and that the said order has not been
challenged by the applicant. It was submitted that the said order since signed
by the majority members of the Tribunal, would hold field under the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, until and unless set aside by the
appellate court. It was contended that the majority members had signed the
order and thereafter the minority resigns, then also such order would hold the
field and any other view would frustrate the entire exercise undertaken under
Section 17 and the entire purpose would be defeated.
4.4 Learned senior counsels for respondents relied on the contentions in their
respective affidavits-in-reply. They pinpointed the aspect that the
proceedings of applicant's application under Section 17 of the Act had
progressed before the Arbitral Tribunal and the order was drawn and that it
was signed by the majority members of the Tribunal. In this regard, in order
to submit that the order  Page 24 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55
IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT would bind, the provision of sub-section
(3) of Section 15 was referred to, which provides that unless otherwise agreed
by the parties, an order or ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal made prior to
replacement of an arbitrator shall not be invalid solely becuse there has been
a change in the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal.
4.4.1 It is clarified that the above issue or the aspect - whether the order
claimed to have been passed - in Application under Section 17 of the Act which
was claimed to have been signed by majority arbitrators, stands valid in eye
of law or not etc. is not the subject-matter or within the compass of present
controversy. Therefore, the Court has only recorded submissions made by the
parties in that regard. The said issue is not gone into herein. Nor anything
is expressed on merits, and recording of submissions shall not be construed as
having gone into merits on that score or expression on merits.
5\. While the part of the factual merits and rival submissions on that count
are recorded in this order, they are neither elaborated nor are gone into in
depth, as in the ultimate analysis of the facts and aspects of the case, and
after hearing learned counsels for the parties, the court was of the view that
for considering the grantability or otherwise of the prayers, the factual
merits were not necessary to be adverted to. It was only to be seen, adjudged
and decided as to whether the test of Section 9(3) of the Act was satisfied in
the facts of the case. The court  Page 25 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30
13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT has accordingly not gone into
factual merits.
5.1 Now, therefore, the provisions of Section 9 and in particular Section 9(3)
may be considered. The Section reads as under.
> "Section 9. - Interim measures, etc. By Court. - (1) A party may, before or
> during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral
> award but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36, apply to a

> (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound

> (ii) for an interim measure or protection in respect of any of the following
> matters, namely:-
> (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the

> (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;
> (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which
> is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any

5.1.1 Section 9 thus permits interim measures. A party to the arbitration may
seek such interim protective measures either at the stage before the
commencement of the arbitral proceedings or post- making of award before it it
enforced. However, sub- section (3) is a provision in the nature of exception.
There is a mandate not to entertain an application under sub-section (1) of
Section 9 once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. The words used are
"the court shall not entertain". The necessary implication is that once the
Arbitral Tribunal is constituted by the parties, application under Section 9
would not be enertainable by the Court since the remedy of similar kind under
Section 17 of the Act is provided for by the legislature to be resorted to
before the Arbitral Tribunal. A rider is also provided in sub-section (3) of
Section 9 that if such remedy under Section 17 could be said to be becoming
inefficacious, then only the Court may entertain an application under Section
9. In other circumstances, a party has to file an application under Section 17
before the constituted Arbitral Tribunal.
5.1.2 Sub-section (2) and sub-section (3) in Section 9 came to be subsequently
introduced by Act No.3 of 2016 with effect from 20th October, 2015. The  Page
27 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV
JUDGMENT object of insertion of both these sub-sections is to see that steps
are not unnecessarily resorted to for interim measure under Section 9 or that
Section 9 measures are not unduly protracted by the party who may have
obtained the order for interim measures under Section 9 but would while away
the time in commencing the actual arbitral proceedings to continue to enjoy
the interim measures. Therefore, by resorting to sub-section (2) in Section 9,
it is provided that if before the commencement of arbitral proceedings a court
has passed order of interim measure of protection under sub-section (1),
arbitration proceedings shall have to be commenced within a period of 90 days
from the date of such order.
5.1.3 With similar objective, sub-section (3) of Section 9 which is under
consideration in this controversy, was also inserted. It provides that no
application would be entertained by the court where arbitration proceedings
have commenced. This sub- section (3) and the amendment in that regard would
indicate that the said provision is brought into the statute book so as to
give primacy to Section 17 when the arbitration proceedings are pending before
the Arbitral Tribunal. The party is expected to resort to Section 17 for
having an interim measure of protection when the arbitration proceedings are
underway. However, a provision is made to mention an exception that in such
circumstances where remedy under Section 17 does not become efficacious, then
in such eventuality, application under Section 9 may be  Page 28 of 38
Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT
entertained by the Court.
5.1.4 The introduction of sub-section (3) to Section 9 in the Act had a
purpose. In the Report No.246 of the Law Commission of India (August, 2014)
(Page No.44), it is highlighted that this amendment seeks to reduce the role
of the court in relation to the grant of interim measures once the Arbitral
Tribunal has been constituted. The Law Commission stated that after or, once
the Tribunal is ceased of the matter, it is most appropriate that the Tribunal
to hear all interim applications. Thus, Section 17 came to be amended to
provide the Arbitral Tribunal the same powers as the court would have under
Section 9 of the Act.
5.2 It stands to reason that once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, the
remedy of interim measures for protection would lie and would have to be dealt
with by the Tribunal with whom the arbitral dispute between the parties is
pending and which is well aware of the compass and the canvass of the
controversy to be better equipped and poised to deal with the prayer for
interim measures for protection which would raise issues touching the pending
dispute between the parties before the Tribunal.
5.3 The basic postulate is that it would be the constituted Arbitral Tribunal
which shall here and taken up all interim applications. Once the arbitration
has commenced, measures of protection by invoking Section 9 cannot be availed
of, for, remedy  Page 29 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019
C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT under Section 17 would be specifically available
before the Arbitral Tribunal. Once the arbitration proceedings have commenced,
it is considered trite that the parties take up all matters relating to the
subject matter of dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal and does not go to the
court on one pretext or other when the arbitration proceedings are pending.
5.4 The idea is not only to reduce the burden on the courts, but to congregate
the determination of the issues relating to subject matter of arbitration
dispute in the matter of interim protective measures, to be decided by the
Arbitral Tribunal which is ceased of and which is in know of the compass of
the controversy between the arbitrating parties. For the Court, the discretion
to entertain Section 9 application overriding the availability of provision of
Section 17 before the tribunal, could be said to be extremely confined,
limited to the ground that Section 17 proceedings may render themselves not
efficacious. Having regard to the nature of provision of Section 9 vis-a-vis
that of Section 17, it cannot be said that every case now and then or any
sundry reason, could be viewed as one wherein the remedy under Section 17
could be readily treated as not efficacious.
6\. Viewing the facts of the case in the context of aforesaid requirement in
sub-section (3) of Section 9 of the Act, it was a submission advanced by
learned senior counsel for the respondents that the  Page 30 of 38 Downloaded
on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT Presiding
Arbitrator who was Honourable Supreme Court Judge (Retd.), was always-and-all-
the-time-above board person and man of integrity, against whom allegations
were raised by the applicant, perhaps deliberately, to divert the arbitral
proceedings which had progressed substantially. It was submitted that the
applicant - claimant found that he was unlikely to succeed in his application
under Section 17 of the Act, therefore the applicant adopted different means
and address letter dated 28th November, 2018 making allegations against the
Arbitral Tribunal.
6.1 From the facts highlighted in the preceding paragraphs, it clearly
appeared that it was a conduct on part of the applicant in addressing letter
dated 28th November, 2018 making allegations against the Arbitral Tribunal,
resulted into prolongation of the proceedings of application under Section 17
already preferred by the applicant. The allegations made in the aforementioned
letter against the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and in particular
Presiding Arbitrator, were not shown to be substantiated by any material. It
appeared that they are made for the sake of making in absence of any material
whatsoever.
6.2 The conduct of the applicant could not be brushed aside as of non-bearing
nature, when the applicant has justified the filing of the present application
notwithstanding the fact that his application under Section 17 is pending, to
put-forth the case that the present application under Section 9 Page 31 of 38
Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT is
required to be entertained. While the entire approach of the party to raise
allegations against the arbitrators was deplorable, the act of filing the
present application under Section 9 of the Act wholly lacked in its legal
strength when it could not be suggested by any circumstance, aspect or factor
that the remedy of Section 17 already availed would be rendered inefficacious
before the Arbitral Tribunal already constituted. Inefficaciousness is
ineffectiveness. In order to maintain an application under Section 9 of the
Act when the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, what is required in terms of
Section 9(3) is that the remedy under Section 17 stands inefficacious, to say
ineffective.
6.3 A party who indulges into bare allegations against the arbitrators for
alleged inaction and by making allegations of bias and levelling insinuations
without any proof or material, cannot complain at the same time that the
proceedings stood protracted and the remedy of application under Section 17
has become inefficacious. Nor the act of making allegations per se against the
members of the Arbitral Tribunal by any party to the arbitration could be
viewed as a circumstance rendering the remedy under Section 17 of the Act to
be not efficacious. The applicant cannot take advantage of its own conduct, so
as to contend now that Section 9 may be permitted to be invoked even though
the proceedings under Section 17 were pending before the Arbitral Tribunal,
which stands constituted.

JUDGMENT
6.4 It is an admitted position that now the new Arbitral Tribunal has been
constituted by the parties to the arbitration. It consist of Vinayak Pradhan
as Presiding Arbitrator and two co-arbitrators, one of whom was earlier
nominated Honourable Judge of the Supreme Court (Retd.) and one Mr.Andre Yeap,
who was nominated by the applicant. As the new members of the Arbitral
Tribunal have already been chosen by the parties and the parties have already
thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the new Arbitral Tribunal and that
application under Section 17 of the applicant is already made and pending, it
is for the newly constituted Arbitral Tribunal to consider the said
application to take to its logical end. It is expected even from the parties
to the arbitration that the proceedings are concluded before the newly
constituted Arbitral Tribunal without whiling away the time and in shortest
possible span.
6.5 The members of the newly constituted Arbitral Tribunal were chosen by the
parties themselves and the applicant was ad idem in the constitution of the
Arbitral Tribunal. Once the fresh Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and the
parties are before it, there is no reason as to why the Tribunal could not
take up and immediately decide the application for interim measures under
Section 17 of the Act. It could hardly be contended that before the newly
constituted Tribunal, the remedy under Section 17 of the Act is not
efficacious and effective so as to lend a justification to iunvoke and utilise
the provisions of Section 9 of the Act before this Court.
Page 33 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV
JUDGMENT
No circumstance could be pointed out or found to be existing on the basis of
which it could be said that remedy under Section 17 would render not
efficacious.
6.6 As the Arbitral Tribunal is now constituted, the question of entertaining
application under Section 9 by this Court does not arise as it is not possible
in the facts of the case to conclude that proceedings under Section 17 before
the new tribunal which are pending would become efficacious which were never
inefficacious at any earlier point of time, but for the conduct of the
applicant himself. A lame excuse was sought to be put-forth on behalf of the
applicant that the Arbitral Tribunal has yet not given any definite date. It
is always open to the parties including the applicant to approach the Arbitral
Tribunal to request to take up and decide the proceedings of Section 17 at the
earliest. The proceedings before the new tribunal could be get completed. Once
the Tribunal is constituted and available and when the application under
Section 17 is already moved and pending, the present application by the
applicant before this Court is not well conceived either on facts or in law.
6.7 In addition, what is noticeable is also the aspect that the present Civil
Application was somehow opted to be filed by the applicant invoking Section 9
of the Act, at a time when the new Arbitral Tribunal was already constituted,
the new Presiding Arbitrator was appointed and the new Tribunal was fully set
to deal with and decide the proceedings before it  Page 34 of 38 Downloaded on
: Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT including the
applicant's application under Section 17 of the Act.
7\. The proceedings under Section 9 are not appellate proceedings. Nor Section
9 of the Act can be converted or used as an appeal when the Arbitral Tribunal
is available to look into the merits for the similar prayers which is pending
in this case, or in a given case could be made to the Tribunal, under Section
17 of the Act.
8\. The whole arbitral dispute is pending consideration before the Arbitral
Tribunal. The interim measures prayed for by the applicant has a necessary
interaction to the aspects of main controversy. The issues relate to main
controversy and the question of interim measures prayed for have to be decided
in that light and context. Therefore when the dispute is already before the
Arbitral Tribunal, the proper and expedient remedy for interim protective
measures is, in all ordinary circumstances, under Section 17 of the Act. It is
before the Arbitral Tribunal that the dispute between the parties regarding
interim protection could be better appreciated and adjudicated.
8.1 The Arbitral Tribunal who would be in know of the factual canvass of the
dispute, would be able to precisely and effectively deal with the prayers
regarding interim measures. The remedy under Section 17 therefore, in that
way, could be rather said to be an effective and efficacious remedy to be
properly  Page 35 of 38 Downloaded on : Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019
C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT taken recourse to when the Arbitral Tribunal is
constituted. As far as the facts of the present case is concerned, it may be
stated at the cost of the repetation that in the present case such application
under Section 17 is not only already made by the applicant, the same was
subjected to a progress before the Arbitral Tribunal to be now concluded to
its logical end by the newly constituted Arbitral Tribunal.
9\. In view of the above facts and the aspects emerging and for the foregoing
reasons and discussion, the present application is not liable to be
entertained and requires to be rejected.
10\. While parting, it is required to be observed that the process of
arbitration has its own sanctity. The arbitral process is a process in law. It
is a statutory procedure. Provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 govern the process. The parties are bound, while choosing the dispute
resolution method of arbitration, by the envisages of law and the ethics of
conduct. Any process of law including the arbitration process is not a
trading. Litigants are expected to observe the norms of decency. The facts of
the instant case left a prima facie impression that the litigant party finding
himself to be on the backfoot in terms of favourable order and sensing that
proceedings may not turn out to be in his favour, proceeded to make
allegations in black and white against the Presiding Arbitrator who was none
other than a highly respectable Judge of the  Page 36 of 38 Downloaded on :
Sun Jun 30 13:06:55 IST 2019 C/MCA/90/2019 CAV JUDGMENT Supreme Court (Retd.).
10.1 It has to be observed that members of the Arbitral Tribunal including the
Presiding Arbitrators who withdrew from the Arbitral Tribunal and the
Presiding Arbitrator who walked out pursuant to allegations in letter dated
28th November, 2018, were all retired Honourable Judges of the Supreme Court
(Retd.) and stalwarts in the legal field. Levelling allegations and repeating
them in the legal pleadings have to be necessarily eschewed. Besides that the
approach of the applicant on this count is to be denounced, the conduct of the
applicant represents how litigating parties have in the recent times developed
a rank commercial mind-set to pursue their commercial interests solely and
self-servingly. Such litigants with pelf care little to accord respect to the
members of the Honourable Judges, the members of the legal fraternity and
legal luminaries chosen by themselves to be their arbitrators or
representatives. The affairs of the arbitration have touched the state of
nadir at the hands of those who care scant for ethics in litigating, where
fairness to legal forums and faith in them are sine qua non.
10.2 The total sequence of events and the conduct of the applicant has
contributed only to bring the dispute resolution remedy of arbitration under
the Arbitration Act, to a disrepute. The delay whichever occurred is due to
the conduct of the parties, to be deprecated. It defeated the very purpose of
arbitration which is to bring about an early  Page 37 of 38 Downloaded on :

10.3 The facts and circumstances not only reveal the above sorry state of
affairs, the present application came to be filed by the applicant invoking
Section 9 of the Act when the new Arbitral Tribunal was already constituted.
The members of the Tribunal and the Presiding Arbitrator were appointed by the
parties and application under Section 17 of the Act of the applicant was also
pending. In the cumulative circumstances obtained above, the present
proceeding could be said to be hardly bona fide and partakes abuse of process
of law.
