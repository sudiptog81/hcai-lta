2\. The assessee is engaged in manufacture of Ceramic Fiber Bulk and Ceramic
Fiber Products. They have received Intellectual Property Service from
M/s.Morgan Crucible Co.Plc. UK. As per the Know-how Agreement dt.1.2.1995 the
assessee paid royalty of 1.3% of the net selling price of Ceramic Fibre
Products to Morgan Crucible Co. Plc. UK. Department took the view that  2
Appeal Nos.ST/517/2011 ST/513/2011 & ST/CO/41205/2013 assessee is liable to
discharge service tax liability under the category of "Intellectual Property
Service" under section 65 (55b) read with Section 65 (105) (zzr) w.e.f.
10.09.2004. Two Show cause notices were issued for recovery of a total amount
of Rs.17,99,176/- (Rs.10,95,575 + Rs.7,03,601) towards service tax demand
under reverse charge for the period from September 2004 to December 2006 and
January 2007 to December 2007. After due process of law, the adjudicating
authority confirmed the demand as proposed in the SCNs with interest and
imposed penalties under Section 76, 77 & 78 of the Finance Act, 1994\. On
appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) modified the order of the original
authority to the extent of restricting the tax demand along with interest on
Royalty payments only w.e.f. 18.04.2006 and setting aside of penalties imposed
under Section 76 & 78 of the Act. Assessee being aggrieved with the order of
lower appellate authority against confirmation of demand is in Appeal
ST/517/2011. Revenue being aggrieved on non-confirmation of demand of service
tax from 1.1.2005 and non-imposition of penalties under Section 76 & 78 of the
Act, has filed Appeal No.ST/513/2011.
2\. Ld. counsel Shri M. Kannan appearing on behalf of the assessee made the
following submissions:
i) The payment was made in terms of the agreement dated 1.2.1995 and there
cannot be any tax liability for the services rendered prior to 10.09.2004.
Liability to service tax will arise only with reference to payments made
during September 2004 to December 2007 where such payments relate to transfer
of right to use IPR on or after 10.09.2004, the date on which service tax levy
came  3 Appeal Nos.ST/517/2011 ST/513/2011 & ST/CO/41205/2013 into force on
IPR service. Hence assessee is not liable to pay service tax for the IPR
services received prior to that date.
ii) In department appeal, counsel submits that Revenue is in appeal to confirm
the demand of service tax under reverse charge from 1.1.2005. He submits that
the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Indian National Shipowners
Association Vs UOI - 2009 (13) STR 235 (Bom.) has held that reverse charge
mechanism in terms of Section 66A will be effective only from 18.04.2006. The
said decision has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as reported in
2010 (17) STR J57 (SC). The aforesaid judgements have also been followed by
Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of T.Abdul Wahid & Co Vs UOI 2017 (47)
STR 123 (Mad.). Department appeal deserves to be dismissed on monetary ground
also in the wake of recent Board's Instructions dt. 11.07.2018.
iii) As regards imposition of penalty, he submits that, in the event of
liability for payment of tax, the assessee is entitled to avail cenvat credit
and the entire situation is revenue-neutral and no malafide intention can be
attributed against the assessee and therefore the lower appellate authority
has rightly set aside the penalties. In this regard, he relied upon Tribunal's
decision in Modern Woolens Vs CCE Jaipur - 2017 (52) STR 288 (Tri.-Del.). For
these reasons, He prays for allowing appeal of the assessee and dismissal of
Revenue's appeal.
3\. Ld. A.R Shri A. Cletus reiterated the grounds of appeal.
4\. Heard both sides.

Appeal Nos.ST/517/2011 ST/513/2011 & ST/CO/41205/2013
5\. The assessee is aggrieved by the decision of the lower appellate authority
upholding the demand of service tax under IPR service, albeit only from
18-04-2006. Their main contention in appeal is that payment having been made
in terms of agreement dated 1-2-1995, service tax liability cannot be foisted
on them, since IPR service became taxable only w.e.f. 10.09.2004. However, we
note that the said Agreement required the assessee to pay royalty annually to
their foreign service provider, based at 1.3% of ceramic refractory fibre
sales. As per the two related show cause notices dated 11.8.2008 and
02.02.2009 such payments have been made from September 2004 to December 2006
and January 2007 to December 2007 respectively. No infirmity is then found in
the inclusion of Lower appellate authority in para 5.1 of the impugned order
that transfer of knowhow is not a onetime affair for which royalty charges are
being paid even during the disputed period. At the same time, the authority
has correctly followed the ratio laid down by High Court of Bombay in Indian
National Ship Owners Association - 2009 (13) STR 235 (Bom.) to decide that
assessee are liable to pay service tax, with interest thereon, on the Royalty
charges paid, only w.e.f. 18.04.2006, i.e. after enactment of Section 66A of
the Act. The Lower appellate authority has also given further relief to the
assessee by setting aside penalty under section 76 ibid.
6\. We thus find that the impugned order is just, fair and legally correct.
The assessee appeal ST/517/2011 therefore does not hold merit for which reason
it is dismissed.

for filing the appeal before the Tribunal by the Revenue has been fixed at Rs.
20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs only). Since in this appeal the amount is
less than Rs. 20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs only), the appeal has to be
rejected. The Revenue's appeal is dismissed on monetary limits. The cross
objections filed by respondent also stands disposed.
