> read divorced from the context in which they were used.""
67\. Consequently, with utmost respect, I hold a different view from the view
of the Division Bench in Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
68\. For all the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that this court has no
territorial jurisdiction to deal with the present suit. Accordingly, the
plaint is liable to be returned under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC. The plaintiff may,
if it so desires, move an application under Order 7 Rule 10A CPC. The
VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1\. This application has been moved by the defendant under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC
to seek the return of the plaint to the plaintiff for filing the same in the
proper court having jurisdiction, on the premise that this court lacks
territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present suit.
2\. The plaintiff has filed the present suit under section 134 and 135 of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Copy Right Act, 1957 alleging I.A. No.11034/2015
in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 1 of 43 infringement of the plaintiffs
registered trademark as well as infringement of the plaintiffs copyright, and
passing off. The plaintiff also seeks rendition of accounts etc. from the
defendant. The case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff M/s. RSPL Limited,
which has its registered office at Kanpur and corporate office at Pitampura,
New Delhi is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of soaps
and detergents. The plaintiff claims to have honestly and bonafidely adopted
the trademark GHARI/WATCH/ CLOCK since 1975. The plaintiffs mark GHARI label
is registered with the Registrar of Trademarks in several classes. Several
applications of the plaintiff for registration of the trademark GHARI label
are also stated to be pending.
3\. The plaintiff claims to hold a copyright in the original art work in GHARI
label, which is also stated to be registered. The plaintiff claims that its
mark/ label is well known. In para 26 of the plaint, the plaintiff avers as
follows:-
> "26. That to the best of knowledge of the plaintiff, the defendant no.1
> namely Mr. Mukesh Sharma is the lawyer and proprietor of his law firm namely
> GHARI TRADE MARK COMPANY (referred to as the impugned trade name) situated
> at 64, Kailashpuri, Bulandshahar (U.P.) and is engaged in providing legal
> and advisory services in relation to IPR matters (referred to as the
> impugned services). The word/name GHARI is the most important part of the
> impugned trade name".
> (emphasis supplied)
4\. The plaintiff claims that by adopting the firm name GHARI TRADE MARK
COMPANY, the defendant is infringing the plaintiffs trademark. In I.A.
No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 2 of 43 para 35 of the plaint, the
plaintiff states that in the third week of November 201, the plaintiff
received the caveat petition filed by the defendant in different district
courts at Delhi. The plaintiff claims in para 37 of the plaint that this court
has territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit as:
> ".... The defendants are committing the impugned acts within the
> jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court by conducting, soliciting, rendering the
> impugned services within the impugned trade name within the territorial
> jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. The plaintiff is having its corporate
> office at 3rd Floor, C-1, 2 and 3, Netaji Subhash Place, Wazirpur District
> Centre, Pitampura, New Delhi-110034 which is nerve center of the plaintiff's
> said business and from where the plaintiff has been carrying on with its
> important aspects of its business including marketing, distribution and
> finance and is carrying on its said goods and business under the said
> trademark/ label within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court
> ...."
> (emphasis supplied)
> 5\. The submission of counsel for the defendant/applicant is that this court
> does not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. This
> submission is premised on the fact that the plaintiffs registered office is
> situated at Kanpur. Though the corporate office of the plaintiff is situated
> at New Delhi - within the jurisdiction of this court, the applicant states
> that no part of cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this
> court.
Consequently, it is stated that this court does not have the territorial
jurisdiction to deal with the suit in the light of judgment of the Supreme
Court in Indian Performing Right Society v. Sanjay Walia & Ors., (2015) 10 SCC
161.
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 3 of 43
6\. The submission of Mr. Bansal, learned counsel for the plaintiff to justify
the filing of the present suit in this court is, firstly, that the defendant
had filed caveats in different district courts of Delhi, which itself shows
that the defendant is carrying on his legal profession within the jurisdiction
of this court. He submits that the filing of the caveat itself constitutes a
part of the cause of action. Mr. Bansal states that in para 36, the plaintiff
has averred that cause of action arose, inter alia, in the third week of
November 2014 when the plaintiff received the caveat filed by the defendant at
the district courts in Delhi. He has also referred to one of the caveats,
wherein the defendant has stated he is engaged in the business of carrying on
its profession under the trademark GHARI trademark company. Mr. Bansal submits
that the plaintiff has specifically averred in para 38 that the defendant is
carrying on his profession within the jurisdiction of this court by
conducting, soliciting, rendering his services with the impugned trademark
within the territorial jurisdiction of this court.
7\. Mr. Bansal submits that the averments made in para 37 of the plaint have
to be accepted as true on a demurer to decide the said issue of jurisdiction,
at this stage. He submits that the said averment of the plaintiff would have
to be tested on the anvil of evidence that the parties may lead at the trial
of suit. Mr. Bansal also refers to para 2 of the preliminary objections in the
written statement of the defendants. The defendants have merely stated that
they are "not residing or carrying on their business in Delhi. It is hereby
submitted that the defendants are operating and providing their services for
registration of trade marks from Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh only, thus no
cause of action can be said to have arisen in I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS)
No.124/2015 Page 4 of 43 Delhi, and therefore, the suit is not maintainable
within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court in Delhi as neither
the defendants are residing or carrying on their business in Delhi nor any
cause of action has arosen in Delhi".
8\. Mr. Bansal submits that there is no denial of the specific averment made
by the plaintiff in para 37 of the plaint to the effect that the defendants
are soliciting work within the jurisdiction of this court. The only denial
pertains to the defendants residing or carrying on their business within
Delhi. Mr. Bansal submits that soliciting work within the jurisdiction of this
court also gives rise to cause of action to the plaintiff as the said activity
is being undertaken under the impugned mark.
9\. In support of this submission, learned counsel for the plaintiff has
sought to place reliance on Govardhan Motels & Restaurants v. I. Subramanyam &
Anr., 2008 (36) PTC 513 (Del). In this case, the defendant, an ex-employee of
the plaintiff - who was carrying on the business of running vegetarian
restaurant under the mark 'Govardhan', had adopted the mark 'Goverdhan' in
respect of a similar trade. The submission of the defendants was that their
activity was being conducted in Gurgaon in the State of Haryana, i.e. outside
the jurisdiction of the court. It was the case of the defendants that
defendant no.2's restaurant was owned by a third party, and not by defendant
no.1 the ex-employee. Thus, the submission of the defendants was that no part
of cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this court. The
plaintiff had invoked Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act as the plaintiff
claimed copyright in the stylized form in which the mark 'Govardhan' was
displayed. The plaintiff's principle place I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS)
No.124/2015 Page 5 of 43 of business was within the jurisdiction of this
Court. Territorial jurisdiction was also claimed by the plaintiff on the
premise that part of cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of the
court by resort to Section 20(c). The jurisdiction was claimed by the
plaintiff by claiming that:
> "The defendant no. 1 resides in Delhi at 140-G, 1st Floor, Gautam Nagar, New
> Delhi and works for gain at Delhi. ... ... Both defendants no. 1 & 2
> individually or in unison are soliciting customers, clients and trade of the
> plaintiff in Delhi. The defendants are carrying on, promoting and soliciting
> trade under the impugned GOVERDHAN trade mark/trade name in Delhi interalia
> by circulating trade & promotional material, packed foods etc. and through
> the word of mouth in Delhi thereunder. The defendants are catering to
> customers/clients based and residing in Delhi. Numerous residents of Delhi
> are availing of the impugned goods & business of the defendants. ... ... The
> plaintiff's said goods & business under its said trade mark/trade name and
> the goodwill and reputation thereof is being adversely effected in Delhi due
> to the defendants impugned activities. The defendants impugned acts of
> passing off and violation and infringement of copyright are taking place in
> Delhi. The cause of action in whole and/or in part has arisen within the
> jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. ... ...in Delhi from its aforesaid two
> restaurants, which are its nerve center and from where the plaintiff has
> been controlling and carrying on each and every aspect of its said goods &
> business under its said trade mark/trade name, respectively in Adchini and
> Kashmiri Gate in Delhi. This Hon'ble Court, in addition, also has the
> jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section
> 62(2) of the copyright Act."
10\. The Court while rejecting the objection to the territorial jurisdiction
of this court observed as follows:
> "16. From the aforesaid it is evident that it is, inter-alia, claimed by the
> plaintiff that the defendants are soliciting I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS)
> No.124/2015 Page 6 of 43 customers, clients and trade of the plaintiff in
> Delhi. It is claimed that they are promoting and soliciting business under
> the impugned trademark/trade name in Delhi by circulating trade and
> promotional material, packed food and by word of mouth in Delhi. It is
> claimed that the defendants are catering to customer residing in Delhi. The
> plaintiff also claims adverse effects on, inter-alia, its reputation in
> Delhi. The aforesaid actions, to my mind, constitute a part of the cause of
> action which the plaintiff claims have arisen in its favour.
> 17\. Even if one were to ignore the other averments made by the plaintiff,
> which, according to him, constitute a part of the cause of action, at least
> the averments culled out in the previous paragraph would in my view,
> constitute a part of the cause of action since the plaintiff would have to
> prove the aforesaid conduct and actions of the defendants to support its
> claim for injunction and damages on the ground that it causes prejudice to
> the business of the plaintiff. The averment of the plaintiff that the
> defendants are soliciting prospective customers of the plaintiff also finds
> support from the report of the Local Commissioner appointed by this court
> which shows that the defendant is distributing its food packets by providing
> home delivery to its customers. The argument of the defendants that the free
> home delivery service is restricted within a radius of 5 Kms, cannot be
> taken to mean that it does not deliver its food packets beyond the limit of
> 5 Kms free or otherwise for a charge. Moreover, these averments would have
> to be tested at the trial of the suit. As aforesaid, the averments made in
> the plaint have to be assumed to correct, if the issue of jurisdiction is to
> be decided by this court at this preliminary stage".
11\. Mr. Bansal further submits that the defendants have filed their
opposition to the application of the plaintiff before the Registrar of
Trademark in Delhi, which itself gives cause of action to the plaintiff.
12\. Mr. Bansal submits that the settled position of law is that if a part of
cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this court, this court
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 7 of 43 would have
territorial jurisdiction to deal with the suit. In support of this submission,
he has placed reliance on Pfizer Products Sarl v. Cipla Ltd., 2009 (39) PTC
358 (Del.) (DB). For the same purpose, reliance is also placed on Intas
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Allergan Inc., 2006 (32) PTC 272 (Del.) (DB). I may
here itself observe that there could be no quarrel with the said proposition.
However, the issue remains whether any part of cause of action has arisen
within the jurisdiction of this court.
13\. On the other hand, the submission of learned senior counsel for the
defendants is that no part of cause of action can be said to have arisen
within the jurisdiction of this court. It is pointed out by Mr. Uppal that the
plaintiff has not disclosed any address of the defendant wherefrom the
defendant is alleged to be carrying on its professional activities in Delhi.
Pertinently, the plaintiff sought the appointment of a local commissioner to
visit the premises of the defendant situated at Kailashpuri, Bulandshahar,
U.P. and at no address in Delhi. Mr. Uppal submits that the averment of the
plaintiff that the defendant is carrying on its business, soliciting work etc.
within the jurisdiction of this court is completely vague and devoid of
particulars, and such an averment cannot be accepted in the absence of
relevant particulars.
14\. After the hearing was concluded, the plaintiff has tendered in court the
following decision in support of his submission:
> i) Pfizer Products, Inc v. Rajesh Chopra & Ors., 2006 (32) PTC 301 (Del.);
> ii) Bhatia Industries & Ors. v. Pandey Industries & Ors., 2011 (45) PTC 343
> (Del.);
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 8 of 43
> iii) LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Bhogilal Patel & Ors., 2012
> (51) PTC 513 (Del.);
> iv) St. Ives Laboratories Inc. v. Ives Drugs (I) Pvt. Ltd., in IA
> No.17479/2011 in CS (OS) 27/2005 decided on 08.10.2013;
> v) Mayar (H.K.) Ltd. & Ors v. Owners & Parties, Vessel M.V.
> Fortune Express & Ors., AIR 2006 SC 1828;
> vi) Laxman Prasad v. Prodigy Electronics Ltd. & Anr., 2008 (37) PTC 209
> (SC).
15\. I have heard learned counsels and considered their respective
submissions. I have also perused the plaint and the documents filed by the
plaintiff and the decisions relied upon by the plaintiff.
16\. In Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), the Supreme Court
while placing reliance on Jones v. Scottish Accident Insurance Co. Ltd. (1886)
LR 17 QBD 421 (DC), observed that, 'the domicile of the company is fixed by
the situation of its principal place of business..........In the case of
companies registered under the Companies Act, the controlling power is, as a
fact, generally exercised at the registered office, and that office is
therefore not only for the purposes of the Act, but for other purposes, the
principal place of business............". In this regard, reliance was placed
on Watkins v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Co. (1889) LR 23 QBD 285 (DC).
17\. In paragraph 19, the Supreme Court observed that:
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 9 of 43
> "19. .......The provisions of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section
> 134 of the Trade Marks Act never intended to operate in the field where the
> plaintiff is having its principal place of business at a particular place
> and the cause of action has also arisen at that place so as to enable it to
> file a suit at a distant place where its subordinate office is situated
> though at such place no cause of action has arisen. Such interpretation
> would cause great harm and would be juxtaposed to the very legislative
> intendment of the provisions so enacted."
> (Emphasis supplied)
> 18\. Para 20 reads as under:
> "20. In our opinion, in a case where the cause of action has arisen at a
> place where the plaintiff is residing or where there are more than one such
> persons, any of them actually or voluntarily resides or carries on business
> or personally works for gain would oust the jurisdiction of other place
> where the cause of action has not arisen though at such a place, by virtue
> of having subordinate office, the plaintiff instituting a suit or other
> proceedings might be carrying on business or personally works for gain."
> (Emphasis supplied)
> 19\. In para 25, the Supreme Court, while rejecting the submission of the
> appellant, who was the plaintiff and had invoked Section 62 of the Copyright
> Act, observed:
> "25. ........The legislature has never intended that the plaintiff should
> not institute the suit where he ordinarily resides or at its head office or
> registered office or where he otherwise carries on business or personally
> works for gain where the cause of action too has arisen and should drag the
> defendant to a subordinate office or other place of business which is at a
> far distant place under the guise of the fact that the plaintiff corporation
> is carrying on business through branch or I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS)
> No.124/2015 Page 10 of 43 otherwise at such other place also. If such an
> interpretation is permitted, as rightly submitted on behalf of the
> respondents, the abuse of the provision will take place. Corporations and
> big conglomerates, etc. might be having several subordinate offices
> throughout the country. Interpretation otherwise would permit them to
> institute infringement proceedings at a far-flung place and at an
> unconnected place as compared to a place where the plaintiff is carrying on
> their business, and at such place, cause of action too has arisen. In the
> instant cases, the principal place of business is, admittedly, in Mumbai and
> the cause of action has also arisen in Mumbai. Thus, the provisions of
> Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act
> cannot be interpreted in a manner so as to confer jurisdiction on the Delhi
> Court in the aforesaid circumstances to entertain such suits. The Delhi
> Court would have no territorial jurisdiction to entertain it."
> (Emphasis supplied)
> 20\. In para 26, the Supreme Court further observed;
> "26. .......It was never visualised by the lawmakers that both the parties
> would be made to travel to a distant place in spite of the fact that the
> plaintiff has a remedy of suing at the place where the cause of action has
> arisen where he is having head office/carrying on business, etc. The
> provisions of the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act provide for the
> authors/trade mark holders to sue at their ordinary residence or where they
> carry on their business. The said provisions of law never intended to be
> oppressive to the defendant. The Parliamentary debate quoted above has to be
> understood in the manner that suit can be filed where the plaintiff
> ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.
> Discussion was to provide remedy to the plaintiff at convenient place; he is
> not to travel away. Debate was not to enable the plaintiff to take the
> defendant to farther place, leaving behind his place of residence/business,
> etc. The right to remedy given is not unbridled and is subject to the
> prevention of abuse of the aforesaid provisions, as discussed above.
> Parliament never I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 11 of 43
> intended that the subject provisions be abused by the plaintiff by
> instituting suit in wholly unconnected jurisdiction. In the instant cases,
> as the principal place of business is at Mumbai the cause of action is also
> at Mumbai but still the place for suing has been chosen at Delhi. There may
> be a case where the plaintiff is carrying on the business at Mumbai and
> cause of action has arisen in Mumbai. The plaintiff is having branch offices
> at Kanyakumari and also at Port Blair, if interpretation suggested by the
> appellants is acceptable, mischief may be caused by such plaintiff to drag a
> defendant to Port Blair or Kanyakumari. The provisions cannot be interpreted
> in the said manner devoid of the object of the Act."
> (Emphasis supplied)
> 21\. Again, in para 52, the Supreme Court observed;
> "52. ......No doubt about it that a suit can be filed by the plaintiff at a
> place where he is residing or carrying on business or personally works for
> gain. He need not travel to file a suit to a place where the defendant is
> residing or cause of action wholly or in part arises. However, if the
> plaintiff is residing or carrying on business, etc. at a place where the
> cause of action, wholly or in part, has also arisen, he has to file a suit
> at that place, as discussed above."
> 22\. From the aforesaid decision in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited
> (supra), and the decision cited by the Supreme Court therein, in my opinion,
> the position that emerges is as follows:
> (a) By resort to Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act and 62 of the Copyright
> Act, the plaintiff may institute the suit where the plaintiff voluntarily
> resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. In the context
> of corporation, which includes a company incorporated under the Indian
> Companies Act, 1956, I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 12 of
> 43 such a place would be the place where the registered office of the
> company is situated. Thus, a company can maintain a suit under Section 134
> of the Trade Marks Act, or Section 62 of the Copyright Act, at the place
> where its registered office is situated, irrespective of the fact, whether
> or not, cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court,
> within whose jurisdiction the registered office of the company is situated.
> (b) Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act and Section 62 of the Copyright Act
> do not take away right of the plaintiff to institute the suit by resort to
> Section 20 of the CPC, as Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act and Section 62
> of the Copyright Act provide an additional forum to the plaintiff alleging
> infringement of the registered trademark or copyright, as the case may be.
> This is clear from the inclusive definition of the expression, 'District
> Court having jurisdiction' contained in Section 134 (2) of the Trade Marks
> Act and Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act. Thus, the plaintiff may file a
> suit for infringement of trademark/copyright either at the place where the
> plaintiff voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for
> gain by resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the
> Trade Marks Act, or at the place where, 'the defendant, or each of the
> defendants where there are more than one, at the time of commencement of the
> suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or
> personally works for gain'. [Section 20 (a)]; or I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S.
> (OS) No.124/2015 Page 13 of 43 where any of the defendants, where there are
> more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and
> voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain,
> provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the
> defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally work for
> gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution [section 20(b)]; or the
> cause of action wholly or in part, arises [section 20(c)].
> (c) The plaintiff cannot file a suit alleging infringement of
> trademark/copyright at a place where it has a subordinate office, by resort
> to Sections 134 of the Trade Marks Act or Section 62 of the Copyright Act,
> unless one of the conditions of Section 20 CPC are satisfied.
> 23\. Since the plaintiffs registered office is not situated within the
> jurisdiction of this court, to be able to maintain the suit within the
> jurisdiction of this court, it is essential for the plaintiff to show that
> some part of cause of action has arisen in Delhi as the defendants,
> admittedly, are situated in Bulandshahar.
24\. The averments of the plaintiff clearly show that there is absolutely
nothing to suggest that the defendant has any presence in Delhi, or that the
defendant has carried out any professional or business activity including that
of soliciting work, or rendering services under the impugned mark within the
jurisdiction of this Court. Pertinently, in para 26, the plaintiff gives the
address of the defendant in Bulandshahar. While stating that the defendant
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 14 of 43 is situated at 64,
Kailashpuri, Bulandshahar, U.P., the plaintiff does not state that the
defendant has any presence or office/address at Delhi. Though in para 37, it
is claimed by the plaintiff that the defendants are conducting the impugned
acts within the jurisdiction of this court by adopting, soliciting and
rendering the services with the impugned trademark within the jurisdiction of
this court, the said averment is as vague as it could be. No particulars,
whatsoever, have been disclosed on the basis of the said averment, in the
plaint.
25\. Order 6 CPC deals with pleadings generally. Order 6 Rule 2 CPC provides
that every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a concise
form of the "material facts" on which the party pleading relies for his claim
or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be
proved. Order 6 Rule 4 provides that in all cases in which the party pleading
relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, willful default, or
undue influence "and in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary
beyond such as are exemplified in the forms aforesaid, particulars (with dates
and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleading". Order 7 deals with
the plaint.
26\. Order 7 Rule 1 CPC deals with "Particulars to be contained in plaint". It
states "The plaint shall contain the following particulars:-
> (a) ... ... ...
> (b) ... ... ...
> (c) ... ... ...
> (d) ... ... ...
> (e) ... ... ...
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 15 of 43
> (f) the facts showing that the Court has jurisdiction;
> (g) ... ... ...
> (h) ... ... ...
> (i) ... ... ..."

28\. The Supreme Court in Udhav Singh v. Madhav Rao Scindia, AIR 1976 SC 744,
while dealing with a case arising out of the Representation of the People Act,
1951 (RPA), and in particular Section 83 thereof, dealt with issue as to what
constitutes "material facts" and "material particulars". Section 83(1)(a) and
83(1)(b) of RPA, insofar as they are relevant, read as follows:
> "83. Contents of petition -
> (1) An election petition--
> (a) shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the
> petitioner relies;
> (b) shall set forth full particulars of any corrupt practice that the
> petitioner alleges including as full a statement as possible of the names of
> the parties alleged to have committed such corrupt practice and the date and
> place of the commission of each such practice; and"

> 29\. The Supreme Court in Udhav Singh (supra), inter alia, observed as
> follows:
> 37\. Like the Code of Civil Procedure, this section also envisages a
> distinction between material facts and material particulars. Clause (a) of
> sub-section (1) corresponds to O.6, R.2, while clause (b) is analogous to
> Order 6 Rules 4 and 6 of the Code. The distinction between "material facts"
> and "material particulars" is important because different consequences may

> In the case of a petition suffering from a deficiency of material

> 38\. All the primary facts which must be proved at the trial by a party to

> 30\. Mahendra Pal v. Ram Dass Malanger & Ors., (2000) 1 SCC 261, is another

31\. In Mahadeorao Sukaji Shivankar v. Ramaratan Bapu and Ors. (2004) 7 SCC
181, which was also a case under the RPA, and pertained to Section 83(1)(a)
and 83(1)(b) of the said Act, the Supreme Court, inter alia, observed:
> "6. ... ... ... The expression "material facts" has neither been defined in
> the Act nor in the Code. It may be stated that the material facts are those
> facts upon which a party relies for his claim or defence. In other words,
> material facts are facts upon which the plaintiff's cause of action or

> opposite party by surprise".

32\. In the context of the claim of territorial jurisdiction, and in the light
of the obligation cast on a plaintiff by Order 7 Rule 1 CPC, "material facts"
would mean all the basic facts constituting the ingredients conferring
jurisdiction on the court which the plaintiff is bound to disclose before he
can claim such jurisdiction. Thus, it is not enough for a plaintiff to plead
that the court has the territorial jurisdiction as a part of cause of action
has arisen within the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiff is obliged to
plead the particulars as to how it is claimed that the cause of action, or a
part of the cause of action, has arisen within the jurisdiction of the court.
The particulars in the present context - wherein the plaintiff claims that the
defendants are carrying on their business, namely, conducting, soliciting and
rendering their services within the jurisdiction of the court, would mean,
atleast the disclosure of the address from where such activity is being
carried out within the jurisdiction of the court. The plaint is completely
silent in this regard. For the sake of argument, even if one were to proceed
on the assumption that the facts showing that the court has jurisdiction are
"particulars", and not "material facts", the plaintiff has not come forward to
disclose the said particulars either in the replication, or in the reply to
the I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 20 of 43 present
application, despite a challenge being raised by the defendant to the
territorial jurisdiction of this court in the present application.
33\. Merely by making a vague and non-specific averment, which is devoid of
particulars, the plaintiff cannot call upon this court to act upon the said
averment, on the premise that the plaintiff is not obliged to lead evidence in
his pleadings, and the plea of territorial jurisdiction should not be decided
at this stage and that the same should be left to be decided only after the
parties have led their evidence at the trial. By disclosing the particulars,
which he is obliged to plead, the plaintiff does not plead evidence. Looking
to the overflowing dockets and workload of the Courts, the Courts are not
obliged to turn a blind eye to frivolous pleas, and to swallow unfounded
averments. The Court is not helpless to deal with such shallow pleas at the
threshold, and nip such causes in the bud.
34\. The plaintiff is not even aware of and, therefore, has not pleaded the
particulars of the cause of action which is claimed to have arisen within the
jurisdiction of the Court. The plaintiff cannot take a blind shot in the dark
and hope to subsequently make good his averment in his pleading. It is one
thing to say that a party may not be aware of definite particulars of the
facts pleaded on the date of filing of his pleadings, but he has definite
knowledge of the facts pleaded, and quite another thing to say that he has no
definite knowledge of the pleaded fact. If the plaintiff had definite
knowledge that the defendants are carrying on their impugned activities within
the jurisdiction of this Court, the plaintiff would also have been aware of
definite particulars in regard thereto. Obviously, the plaintiff has no such
definite knowledge. Pertinently, the plaintiff did not seek appointment of a
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 21 of 43 local commissioner
in respect of any premises of the defendant situated within the jurisdiction
of this court. The plaintiff has not filed any document in relation to the
alleged "conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services" with the
impugned trade name within the jurisdiction of this court.
35\. There is no reason to subject the defendant, who is admittedly located
outside the jurisdiction of this Court, namely in Bulandshahar, U.P., to
continue to face the present proceedings in this Court when the acts of the
defendant, complained of by the plaintiff, have not been undertaken within the
jurisdiction of this Court, and the defendants are also not situated or
working for gain within the jurisdiction of this Court.
36\. The submission of Mr. Bansal that the filing of the caveats by the
defendant in the several district courts at Delhi gives cause of action to the
plaintiff has absolutely no merit. These caveats have been filed by the
defendants in their capacity of litigants/prospective defendants, and not
while acting in their professional capacity on behalf of their client. The
defendant was apprehensive that the plaintiff may institute proceedings within
the jurisdiction of this court. By filing the caveat, the defendant cannot be
assumed to conceding jurisdiction in the court. The purpose of filing caveat
is only to ensure that no ex-parte ad-interim orders of injunction are passed
against the defendant without hearing the defendant. The caveat filed by the
defendant before the District Judge, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi relied upon by
the plaintiff reads as follows:
> "Let nothing be done in the above matter without notice to the undersigned.
> The plaintiff has been harassing for using the word GHARI WHICH IS A
> DICTIONARY WORD and embarrassing by threatening to use local commissioner.
> That I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 22 of 43 caveator is a
> lawyer and running a law firm under the name Ghari Trade mark Co. and
> anticipating a suit for infringement of trade mark, passing off etc.".
There is nothing in the caveat to suggest that the defendants have admitted to
carrying on their business/profession within the jurisdiction of this court.
37\. The submission of Mr. Bansal that the defendant has not denied in the
written statement the averment of the plaintiff that the defendants are
soliciting work within the jurisdiction of this court and, thus, the
defendants have admitted that they are soliciting work in Delhi, is completely
wrong and misconceived. The relevant portion of the preliminary objection
raised by the defendants in their written statement has been set out herein
above. In reply to para 37 of the plaint (in which the plaintiff avers that
the defendants are carrying on their business in Delhi), the defendant has
stated as follows:
> "37. That the contents of para 37 of the plaint are wrong, misleading and
> denied. The plaintiff be put to strict proof thereof. This Hon'ble Court has
> no territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present suit. That the
> cause title/memo of parties of the plaint itself shows that the defendants
> are based at Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh and are not residing or carrying
> their business in Delhi. It is hereby further submitted that the defendants
> have no place of business in Delhi, which is corroborated by the fact that
> there is no documentary evidence filed along with the plaint about such
> service in relation to registration of trade mark from Delhi of the
> defendants, thus no cause of action can be said to have arisen in Delhi for
> filing the present suit, and therefore, the suit is not maintainable within
> the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court in Delhi as neither the
> defendants are I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 23 of 43
> residing or carrying on their business in Delhi nor has any cause of action
> arisen in Delhi. That the plaintiff in paragraph 37 of the plaint have
> falsely claimed that this Hon'ble Court has territorial jurisdiction to
> entertain the present suit by merely averring that by the defendant impugned
> activities in North East Delhi area, besides other parts of country,
> however, such averment is vague and baseless as not supported by any
> material or documentary evidence to showcase and establish to this Hon'ble
> Court for jurisdiction purpose that the defendants are actually doing any
> activity within the territorial jurisdiction of the Courts in Delhi, and
> also that no address of place where defendants, as alleged by plaintiff, are
> carrying out activities in North East Delhi has been mentioned in the
> plaint, thus such an averment is vague and false, and cannot be given any
> credence in law being vague as not supported by any material in its support.
> Thus this Hon'ble Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
> present suit. It is further submitted that the plaintiff just in order to
> create false territorial jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, have vaguely
> stated that the defendants are carrying out activities in North East Delhi

> ............".

38\. Thus, it cannot be said that the defendant has admitted in the written
statement that the defendant is carrying on its business within the
jurisdiction of this court. I may observe that though, for the purpose of
deciding the present issue, the written statement of the defendant cannot be
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 24 of 43 looked into, the
same has been referred only to examine the submission of Mr. Bansal is that
there is an admission made by the defendant in their written statement that
they are carrying on business within the jurisdiction of this court. It is
clear that there is absolutely no admission made by the defendants, who have
repeatedly and categorically stated that they are not residing or carrying on
business in Delhi, and that they have no place of business in Delhi.
39\. The submission of Mr. Bansal that the filing of opposition by the
defendant to the application moved by the plaintiff before the Registrar of
Trademark gives cause of action, also has no merit. Once again, while filing
the opposition, the defendants have acted as the litigating party/opposer and
not in their professional capacity as advocates-to represent the cause of a
client. The opposition would be filed, obviously, before the Trademark
Registry, before whom the application for registration of Trademark is made.
The opposer does not determine the situs of the place where the opposition is
filed. It is determined by the applicant for trademark registration. Thus, the
fact that the defendants have filed their opposition in Delhi, does not
constitute a part of cause of action in favour of the plaintiff.
40\. The Supreme Court in Dhodha House & Patel Field Marshal Industries v.
S.K. Maingi & P.M. Diesel Ltd., 2006 (9) SCC 41 has, inter alia, observed:
> "31. .... ... but a cause of action for filing the suit would not arise
> within the jurisdiction of the court only because an advertisement has been
> issued in the trademark journal or any I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS)
> No.124/2015 Page 25 of 43 other journal notifying the factum of filing of
> such an application".
41\. The said decision was followed in Pfizer Products v. Rajesh Chopra
(supra). In this decision, the Court held that the publication of the
advertisement in the trademark journal would not confer jurisdiction upon a
court within whose territorial limits the advertisement is published or is
seen. The mere allegation that the defendants mark had been advertised in the
trademark journal which was circulated in Delhi, would not constitute a part
of cause of action.
42\. In Union of India v. Adani Exports Limited & Anr., (2002) 1 SCC 567,
while considering the issue of territorial jurisdiction of the High Court to
entertain a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
Supreme Court relied upon its earlier decision in ONGC v. Utpal Kumar Basu &
Ors., (1994) 4 SCC 711, and held that "... ... ... It is clear from the above
judgment that each and every fact pleaded by the respondents in their
application does not ipso facto lead to the conclusion that those facts give
rise to a cause of action within the court's territorial jurisdiction unless
those facts pleaded are such which have a nexus or relevance with the lis that
is involved in the case. Facts which have no bearing with the lis or the
dispute involved in the case, do not give rise to a cause of action so as to
confer territorial jurisdiction on the court concerned."
(Emphasis supplied)
43\. The filing of the opposition by the defendants to the plaintiffs
application for registration of the trademark with the Registrar of Trademarks
in Delhi, or the filing of the caveat by the defendants in several I.A.
No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 26 of 43 district courts in Delhi,
are not facts which either need to be pleaded by the plaintiff in the paint to
establish its cause of action, nor required to be traversed by the defendant
in their written statement and thus, do not constitute facts giving rise to
cause of action.
44\. The decision in Govardhan Motels & Restaurants (supra) does not come to
the aid of the plaintiff in the facts of this case. No doubt, the act of
soliciting business would give rise to cause of action, but the plaintiff has
not made any specific averment as to how the defendant is carrying on its
business and, inter alia, soliciting work within the jurisdiction of this
court. As noticed above, in Govardhan Motels & Restaurants (supra), the
defendant no.1 - an ex-employee of the plaintiff, was carrying on the
infringing business along with another person at Gurgaon, and defendant no.1
was residing within the jurisdiction of the court. Moreover, the report of the
local commissioner clearly establishes that the defendants were soliciting
customers and advertising within the jurisdiction of the court to promote
their infringing brand. The plaintiff had also alleged infringement of the
copyright and invoked Section 62 (2) of the Copyright Act. The plaintiff in
that case was situated in Delhi. Thus, this decision is not applicable in the
facts of this case.
45\. The decision in Bhatia Industries (supra) is of no avail to the
plaintiff. In this case, the plaintiff pointed out that the defendant in its
written statement itself stated that it was selling its goods throughout India
since 1995, which would include Delhi. At another place, the defendant had
claimed that their business activities were confined to the State of U.P. and
they were neither manufacturing, nor selling goods outside the State of U.P.
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 27 of 43
In view of the said contradictory stand, the court did not accept the
defendants application under Order 7 Rule 10 (though styled as one under Order
7 Rule 11). In the present case, there is no inconsistency in the written
statement of the defendants, and the defendants have consistently pleaded that
they have no address in Delhi and they are not carrying on any business in
Delhi. No admission has been pointed out by the plaintiff with regard to the
defendant carrying on their business within the jurisdiction of this court.
46\. Reliance placed on the order dated 08.10.2013 in St. Ives Laboratories
(supra) is of no avail for the reason that the court found that, firstly, the
denial of the defendant to para 22 of the plaint (in which the plaintiff had
asserted the territorial jurisdiction of the court) was minimal, and secondly,
the documents filed by the defendants itself showed that the defendant was
supplying its products at Delhi.
47\. LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) relied upon by the plaintiff is
wholly irrelevant to the point in issue and does not, therefore, need any
comment. There can be no quarrel with the proposition laid down by the Supreme
Court in Mayar (H.K.) Ltd. (supra). For the purpose of examination of the
present application, in the light of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, it is only the
averments made in the plaint and the documents filed by the plaintiff which
are relevant to be examined, and the averments made by the defendant in the
written statement and the documents filed by the defendant would become
relevant only if the plaintiff seeks to rely upon them to claim jurisdiction
in this court. The defendant cannot rely upon its own written I.A.
No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 28 of 43 statement or the
documents filed by it for the purpose of examining the application under Order
7 Rule 10, or Order 7 Rule 11 CPC.
48\. The decision in Laxman Prasad (supra) also has no relevance to the facts
of the present case. In that case, the court found that the defendant had used
the trademark within the jurisdiction of the court by using the mark at a
trade fair in Delhi. Consequently, a part of cause of action had arisen within
the jurisdiction of the court.
49\. After this judgment was reserved and drafted, I have come across a
judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Ultra Home Construction Pvt.
Ltd. v. Purushottam Kumar Chaubey & Ors., in FAO (OS) No.494/2015 rendered on
20.01.2016. Though this judgment was rendered prior to the date on which the
judgment in the present case was reserved, the same was not cited by either of
the counsels at the bar.
50\. On a perusal of the decision in Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd.
(supra), I find that my opinion as incorporated in para-22 above is at
variance with the opinion of the Division Bench. No doubt, the view of the
Division Bench would prevail. But in the present case, the said difference of
opinion does not come in my way in deciding the present case as it has no
relevance to the present case.
51\. Since the said decision in Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra) has
now come to my notice and, with utmost respect, I beg to differ with the view
expressed by the Division Bench in the said case to a limited extent, as a
student of law, I take this opportunity to express my reasons for the said
I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 29 of 43 difference of
opinion and why, in my humble view, the same may need reconsideration.
52\. In Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the plaintiff filed the
suit in this Court alleging infringement of its trademark. The plaintiff had
its registered office/ principal place of business within the jurisdiction of
this Court. The defendant was situated in Deogarh, Jharkand, where the
infringement of the plaintiffs trademark was taking place. The plaintiff also
had a subordinate office at Deogarh, Jharkand. The Division Bench examined the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited
(supra) and observed:
> "13. .... ..... the expression "carries on business" in the context of a
> defendant under section 20 of the Code has also been employed in the context
> of a plaintiff under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). Thus, in addition

54\. The reason for my having a different view is that, apparently, it was not
brought to the notice of the Division Bench that in Indian Performing Rights
Society Limited (supra), the Supreme Court was dealing with a fact situation,
wherein the plaintiff company's principal place of business/ head office was
situated at Mumbai, and the cause of action had also arisen within the
jurisdiction of the courts at Mumbai, whereas the suit had been filed in Delhi
- where the subordinate office of the plaintiff was situated, but where no
cause of action has arisen. This is evident from paras 2 and 3 of the judgment
in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra):
> "2. The appellant-plaintiff in Civil Appeals Nos. 10643-44 of 2010 had filed
> a suit praying for relief against Defendant 1 so as to prevent infringement
> of the rights of the plaintiff without obtaining a licence. The defendant
> owns cinema halls in Maharashtra and Mumbai where the infringement is
> alleged and the entire cause of action, as alleged in the plaint, has arisen
> in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
> 3\. Civil Suit FAO (OS) No. 359 of 2007 has been filed in the High Court at

55\. The extract from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Indian Performing
Rights Society Limited (supra) relied upon by the Division Bench, along with
the emphasis as laid down by the Division Bench, is extracted herein below:
> "14. Considering the very language of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and
> Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, an additional forum has been provided by
> including a District Court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and

> to drag the defendant further away from such a place also as is being done

> applicability of the provisions of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure
> and it is clear that additional remedy has been provided to the plaintiff so

56\. From the above, it would be seen that in para 14 of the judgment in
Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), the Supreme Court recognized
that an additional forum had been provided under Section 62 of the Copyright
Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act by including District Court within
whose limit the plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on
business or personally works for gain, where the plaintiff could institute the
suit for infringement of copyright/ trademark, as the case may be. The object
of these provisions was recognized-as to enable the plaintiff to institute a
suit at a place where he or they resides or carry on business. In the context
of the facts of the case before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court
pertinently observed in the same paragraph:
> "14. ... .... The object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to
> institute a suit at a place where he or they resided or carried on business,
> not to enable them to drag the defendant further away from such a place also
> as is being done in the instant cases ... ....".
> (Emphasis supplied) I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 37 of
> 43
57\. As noticed above, the fact situation considered by the Supreme Court was
where the plaintiff had filed the suit where its subordinate office was
situated (where no part of cause of action had arisen) - and not where its
principal office/ head office was situated. As already noticed above,
incidentally, the entire cause of action in the case before the Supreme Court
had arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court where the principal place of
business/ head office of the plaintiff was situated. The Supreme Court, in my
opinion, did not interpret Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of
the Trade Marks Act to mean that the plaintiff could not file the suit where
its principal place of business was situated, if it had a subordinate office
where the cause of action had arisen. To my understanding, the sentence in the
judgment of the Supreme Court in para 14, which has been emphasized by the
Division Bench, does not in any way impinge on the right of the plaintiff to
file the suit-by resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of
the Trade Marks Act, at the principal place/ head office/ place of residence
of the plaintiff, under any circumstances, as the said extract itself
recognizes that an additional forum has been provided to the plaintiff so as
to file a suit where he is residing or carrying on business, as the case may
be.
58\. From para 15 of the judgment of the Supreme Court, as extracted above, it
appears to me, with utmost respect, that the Division Bench has not
appreciated that the observation of the Supreme Court was in the context of a
defendant, and not in the context of a plaintiff. The explanation following
Section 20(c) CPC is in relation to a defendant, and not in relation to a
plaintiff. Section 20(a) and 20(b) CPC permit the institution of the suit I.A.
No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 38 of 43 where the defendant(s) or
one or more of them "actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business,
or personally works for gain". Section 20(c) permits the filing of the suit
where "the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises". The explanation
following clause (c) is an explanation qua Section 20(a) and Section 20(b).
The said explanation reads:
> "A corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal
> office in [India] or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place
> where it has also a subordinate office, at such place".
59\. Thus, no part of Section 20 CPC is concerned with the situs of the
plaintiff. That is not the focus of the said provision. Section 62 of the
Copyright Act, and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, on the other hand,
focus on the situs of the plaintiff.
60\. The extract of para 18 of the judgment of the Supreme Court itself shows
that the Supreme Court recognized that "it is clear that if a cause of action
has arisen wholly or in part, where the plaintiff is residing or having its
principal office/ carries on business or personally works for gain, the suit
can be filed at such place(s)". The Supreme Court merely stated that the suit
under Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act
"can be filed .... .... ....". The Supreme Court did not observe that such a
suit could only be filed at the place of the principal office or the place of
residence of the plaintiff, or where the plaintiff carries on business or
personally works for gain. The Division Bench has laid great emphasis on the
highlighted portion in para 18 of the judgment of the Supreme Court. With due
respect, while doing so, the material fact in Indian Performing I.A.
No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 39 of 43 Rights Society Limited
(supra) - that no part of cause of action had arisen at the situs of the
subordinate office, was overlooked.
61\. From para 19 of the above extract from the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), to my mind, it is clear
that what the Supreme Court observed was that a suit could not be filed by
resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and Section 134 of the Trade Marks
Act at a distant place where the plaintiff has a subordinate office situated,
when at such place no part of cause of action has arisen.
62\. A perusal of para 20 from the extract of the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), once again, shows
that the Division Bench has not appreciated the factual context in which the
said observations came to be made. Very clearly, the Supreme Court observed
"... ... oust the jurisdiction of other place where the cause of action has
not arisen though at such a place, by virtue of having a subordinate office,
the plaintiff instituting a suit or other proceedings might be carrying on
business or personally works for gain".
63\. Similarly, the portion highlighted in para 21 of the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra), that the
suit should not be filed at other places where the plaintiff is having branch
offices etc. has to be understood in the context that in the cases dealt with
by the Supreme Court, no part of cause of action had arisen at the location of
such branch offices. Since the cause of action had arisen at the place where
the plaintiff was residing/ working for gain and had its principal office, the
Supreme Court observed that the suit could be filed before the Court having
jurisdiction over the said place. The Supreme Court was not I.A. No.11034/2015
in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 40 of 43 dealing with a case where the suit had
been filed at a place where the subordinate office of the plaintiff was
situated and a part of the cause of action had also arisen at the same place.
It was dealing with cases where the cause of action had arisen at the
principal place of business of the plaintiff, and no part of cause of action
had arisen at the place where the subordinate office was situated and where
the suit had been filed by resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act.
64\. In my humble view, there is nothing in the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra) to suggest that the
plaintiff is precluded from filing a suit where its head office/ principal
office is situated, even though it has a subordinate office at a place where
the cause of action arises by resort to Section 62 of the Copyright Act and
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act. In such a situation, the plaintiff, in my
view, could maintain a suit at either of the two places, namely, where its
head office/ principal place of business is situated and where he resides or
works for gain, and also at the place where the plaintiff may have subordinate
office and a part of cause of action has arisen. In fact, even if the
plaintiff does not have a subordinate office at the place where cause of
action has arisen, by resort to Section 20(c) CPC, the plaintiff would be
entitled to file a suit within the jurisdiction of the Court where the cause
of action has arisen, wholly or partly.
65\. As already observed by me, the decision in Ultra Home Construction Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) as regards the third situation discussed in the said judgment
does not come in my way in the present case, since, in the present case, the
plaintiff has filed the present suit simply on the premise that a part of
cause I.A. No.11034/2015 in C.S. (OS) No.124/2015 Page 41 of 43 of action has
arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court and it has a subordinate office
within the jurisdiction of this Court, and I am of the view that, no part of
cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court.
66\. It is well settled that a judgment cannot be read like a statute.
Construction of a judgment should be made in the light of the factual matrix
involved therein. What is more important is to see the issues involved in a
given case, and the context wherein the observations were made by the Court
while deciding the case. Observation made in a judgment, it is trite, should
not be read in isolation and out of context. [See Goan Real Estate &
Construction Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India, (2010) 5 SCC 388]. It is the ratio
of the judgment, and not every observation made in the context of the facts of
a particular case under consideration of the court, which constitutes a
binding precedent. The Supreme Court in P.S. Sathappan v. Andhra Bank Ltd. &
Ors., (2004) 11 SCC 672 has held as follows:
> "144. While analyzing different decisions rendered by this Court, an attempt
> has been made to read the judgments as should be read under the rule of
> precedents. A decision, it is trite, should not be read as a statute.
> 145\. A decision is an authority for the questions of law determined by it.

67\. Consequently, with utmost respect, I hold a different view from the view
of the Division Bench in Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
68\. For all the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that this court has no
territorial jurisdiction to deal with the present suit. Accordingly, the
plaint is liable to be returned under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC. The plaintiff may,
if it so desires, move an application under Order 7 Rule 10A CPC. The
defendants shall be entitled to costs which are quantified at Rs.35,000/-,
which shall be paid by the plaintiff within four weeks.
