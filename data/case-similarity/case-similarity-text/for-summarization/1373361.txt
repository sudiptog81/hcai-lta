Section 29 in The Trade And Merchandise Marks Act, 1958
29\. Infringement of trade marks.
(1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being the
registered proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user thereof using by
way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical
with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark, in relation to any goods in
respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render
the use of the mark likely to be taken as being use as a trade mark.
(2) In an action for infringement of a trade mark registered in Part B of the
register an injunction or other relief shall not be granted to the plaintiff
if the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the use of
the mark of which the plaintiff complains is not likely to deceive or cause
confusion or to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade
between the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and some
person having the right, either as registered proprietor or as registered
user, to use the trade mark.
