the earlier defendants, who were also parties to the present suit, the
appellant's remedy lies in the previous suit. Even on merit, we do not find
anything adverse in favour of the defendants to the extent of entitling the
appellant in getting the interim order. After all, the injunctions was
declined on the earlier occasion except to a very  71/73

443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 limited extent. When once the Apex Court has
observed that the suit has to be expedited and the issues decided, the
appellant ought not to have filed the present one. In fact, the defendants
contended that there is no other way except to use the same 'AdWords'.
18.12.Thus, looking from any perspective, we do not find any error warranting
interference with the order passed by the learned single Judge.
Accordingly, the Original Side Appeals stand dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, connected civil miscellaneous petitions are also dismissed.

                          M.M.SUNDRESH,J.
PREFACE:
1.1.Internet has created a new class of literates. Anyone who uses internet
sparingly, knows nothing about it, despite formal education becomes a semi
illiterate or literate. World over, there is a rapid escalation of internet
users with a particular reference to our country. It has indeed become
inseparable in the lives of the people as one of absolute necessity.
1.2.An information has to be obtained by crawling. The web is like an
exhaustive library. To get an information, a software known as 'web crawler'
is used to discover the webpages.
1.3.'Google' has earned a reputation of one of the best search engines
worldwide facilitating a primary platform for the advertisement of goods and
services. It has not only started its advertisement business but also 'Ad
Words' programe.
3/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 1.4.The functioning of an AdWord Programme
and the key words are best expressed through the words of google itself.
“(iv)The AdWords program allows an advertiser to create and run these
advertisements through a simple process.. A advertiser, using the AdWords
program creates a sponsored link, will specify the headline, the address of
the web page to which the headline links, and the advertising text, within
certain limits set by Google.
(v)”Keywords” are those words, phrases, sentences, etc., that might trigger
certain sponsored results or advertisements, if they correspond to certain
terms selected by the advertiser to trigger an Advertisement. The terms or
expressions selected by an advertiser trigger advertisements are known as
“Keywords”. For example, a “search term” could be “Trains from Muymbai to New
Delhi” which is typed by the user on the Google Website in the search query
box. The advertiser can select the Keywords “Mumbai Delhi Trains” which is
based on the search terms and for which the advertiser would like his
advertisement to be shown.
It is submitted that the Plaintiff has used the expressions 'AdWords' and
'Keywords' interchangeably. To summarise, it is respectfully submitted that
the term 'AdWords' is the name of the advertising program provided and managed
by Defendant No.5 and that the expression 'Keywords' refers to the terms or
phrases used at the backend as a trigger to display ads that meet the specific
criteria for the display of an ad in response to a search query entered by a
user. These are therefore distinct terms and cannot be used interchangeably.”
4/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440,
442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 1.5.The following is the working
mechanism. “(ii) It is important to appreciate that when a user enters a
search query (search terms) for searching particular information on the Google
Website, the Google Wesite conducts a search of the existing material
available on the third party websites as indexed by (which predominantly
relate to data and content hosted by third parties on their websites) in an
automated manner through its search algorithm and displays the links to the
websites and other information of such search that correspond to the query
entered by the user. The results that are generated are referred to as
“Organic Results” or “Natural results”. The order in which the natural or
organic results are ranked and indexed are based on multiple factors, chief
amongst them being relevance of the respective websites to the search term
entered by the Internet user. The search engine operator does not claim any
remuneration for displaying those results.”.....................
(iii)When such search results are displayed on a page, certain advertisements
also appear at the top or bottom of the page (previously they also appeared on
the right hand side of the search page), clearly distinguished from the search
results by various indicators that included a line along with a label
“Sponsored Links” or 'Ads' in a yellow or green background. Currently all
advertisements are distinguished by a yellow or green coloured label with the
word 'Ad' displayed in it.”  5/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of
2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 1.6.Thus,
“Google” has formulated its own mechanism and policy.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SMO) are the two
primary methods of running business in online business platform. Both these
methods use Keywords as their tool. Using maximum number of keywords is
necessary to optimise web searches and to attain maximum profit. This has been
programmed accordingly by the 'Google'.
1.7.There are three primary players involved in the entire process.
One is the search engine viz., 'Google'. The second is the advertisers, who
bid for the “AdWords” and the third, the consumer/user. The website owners bid
on the keywords/Adwords to get a strategic placement in the web results for
the display of web pages, either as sponsor links or Ads.
1.8.Search platform is required not only from the point of view of the bidders
of 'Google' but also the users. It is like a consumer going to a particular
floor of the Mall which conveniently has a particular product though
manufactured by different entities. If an intending purchaser goes to the said
first floor wherein it is filled up with shoes of different brands belonging
to the different manufacturers, it will be a win-win situation for  6/73

443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 everyone. A consumer can pick the best from
his perspective while creating a healthy competition. He could also assess and
compare the products.
2.FACTS:
2.1.The appellant is a registered trade mark Proprietor. It has not only
registered the mark “BharatMatrimony” but also various other names by
combining the language along with the word “Matrimony” apart from the place
and religion. It has thus, combined the word 'Tamil' with 'Matrimony' and
Kerala with Matrimony etc. This has been done with almost most of the well
known languages and religions.
2.2.We would appositely place on record the registrations obtained by the
appellant as indicated in the plaint.

are the same as the trade marks of the appellant with the only difference
being the space between the words. This made the appellant to file a suit for
permanent injunction on the ground of 'infringement' and 'passing off' filed
in C.S.No.832 of 2009. The learned single Judge(as he then was) through his
celebrated judgment, which is one of its kind, declined the order of
injunction sought for. Though the ultimate decision of the learned single
Judge was confirmed, some of the findings were not agreed upon by the Division
Bench in the judgment reported in Consim Info Private Limited Vs. Google India
Private Limited and others (2012(5) Law Weekly 1).

in paragraph 148, has stated that in spite of leaving a space in between the
two words, it certainly provides a likelihood of confusion. However, the
learned Judge found that the respondents 2 to 4, are also dealing in the same
services i.e. matrimony services as that of the appellant would be left with
no other choice to advertise their services, in case if the use of the
combination of the above word is prohibited. The learned Judge also held that
the grant of an order of injunction would lead to the consequence of reducing
the choice of words available to competitors, to a very few and resulting in
the appellant's monopolising the English word 'Matrimony'. In this connection,
the respondents have not pleaded with regard to alternative synonym for the
words 'Tamil', 'Malayalam', 'Telugu', 'Matrimony' etc. In the absence of any
pleading with regard to the same, we are not agreeing with the finding of the
learned single Judge that by preventing the use of the words would leave the
respondents 2 to 4 with a very limited choice of words.” 2.4.The following are
the ultimate finding by the Division Bench.
“59. Further, in the counter affidavit, first respondent has stated that they
did not allow the registered trademark of any one from being used as adwords
by any other person and that the impression "Adword" as used in the industry
9/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440,
442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 would mean the use of the words in the
title and text of the advertisement. In paragraph 9 of the counter, the first
respondent has reiterated its commitment that they would adhere to the present
business policy and also indicated that its current adwords policy does not
permit the use of any trademarked term in the ad text, i.e., the title and
text of the advertisement. Therefore, it is clear from the order dated
07.10.2009, by recording the undertaking given by the first respondent, the
injunction was vacated. The arrangement made on 07.10.2009 is continuing till
date.
60\. While dismissing both the applications i.e. O.A.Nos.977 and 978 of 2009,
the learned Judge made it clear that dismissal of these applications shall not
be construed to mean that the first respondent (Google) may henceforth deprive
the plaintiff (appellant) of the benefit of their Adwords Trademark Policy, as
reflected in documents filed by them. As already stated we are of the
considered view that the appellant has established their case with regard to
prima facie case and balance of convenience. As such, the appellants are
entitled for injunction. So far as the irreparable hardship is concerned, the
same can be decided only in the trial.” 2.5.The Division Bench was pleased to
observe that there is no pleading to the effect that there were no alternative
words than the one  10/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 &
CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 used by the
appellant and the combination of two words happened deliberately but however,
this can only be examined at the time of trial through the witnesses.
Ultimately, the undertaking given by Google India Private Limited has been
recorded while declining an order of injunction.
Not satisfied with the orders passed, the appellant filed Special Leave
Petition in SLP No.30064-30065/2012, wherein the following order was passed.
“In the meantime, at the first instance, the respondents Nos.2, 3 and 4 in
S.L.P.(C) Nos.30064-30065 of 2012, shall remain restrained from displaying
their names in the website of the petitioner in the “Adwords” programme of the
Google.” 2.6.After hearing Civil Appeal Nos.908-909 of 2016 with
C.A.Nos.906-907 of 2016 dated 04.08.2016, the Civil Appeals were disposed of
as under.
“However, we direct that the Trial Court shall conclude the trial of the
pending cases within six months from the date of communication of this order
to the Trial Court. The interim order granted by this Court in these appeals
on19.10.2012 and confirmed on 02.02.2016 shall continue to operate till the
trials are concluded.
The learned counsel appearing for the parties have assured this Court that
their counterparts appearing before the Trial Court  11/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 shall extend their full co-operation to the
Court so that the matters can be finally decided within the period mentioned
above.
With the above observations and directions, these appeals stand disposed of.
It is needless to mention that the Trial Court shall decide the matters on
their own merits, without being influenced by any observation made by the
Division Bench.” 2.7.In the written statement filed by Google India Private
Limited, the following stand has been taken with respect to the usage of trade
marks in the AdText and as key words.
(x) At the relevant time, the AdWords Trade mark Policy deals with the
approach with respect to use of trademarks in the AdText and as Keywords. At
the time of filing of the present suit and as on date, under the AdWords
Trademarks policy as applicable to Zindia registered trade mark terms that
were reported to Defendant No.5 were investigated from appearing in the AdText
of the advertisement of a third party. The AdWords Trade marks policy did not
restrict the appearance of trademarked terms as keywords to trigger an ad, as
the mere use of a trade mark as a trigger does not violate any rights of a
trademarks  12/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP
Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 owner under the
Trademarks Act.” Thus, Google India Private Limited has taken a specific stand
that there is nothing illegal in the policy that is being adopted.
2.8.On the bidding made to the AdWords as was done earlier, few of the
defendants in the first suit among others got their placements. This triggered
the filing of the second suit notwithstanding the pendency of the earlier one
having a specific direction to expedite the trial. To be noted, 'Google' has
not been arrayed as a party defendant nor any attempt made to file another
injunction application in the pending suit. In the present suit also, the same
issue has been raised though the defence taken by the defendants is rather
exhaustive.
2.9.The learned single Judge dismissed the interlocutory application, inter
alia holding that no case of either infringement or passing off is made out.
As the issue pertains to the AdWord Program of 'Google', not arraying it as a
party defendant to the present suit is fatal. The words are generic and
descriptive. For separating the words and using them accordingly, the
appellant does not have any objection. The appellant cannot claim monopoly.
Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act (hereinafter referred to as  13/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 'the Act') starts with the words 'subject to
other provisions of the Act'.
The first word depicts the language, the religion or the place and the second
word being matrimony. The appellant is only trying to monopolise the business.
This might lead to unfair trade practice and affect the provisions of the
Competition Act, 2002. It is also against the constitutional mandate of right
to carry on one's own trade and profession. Accordingly, by a reasoned order,
the injunction applications were dismissed. To over-
turn them and to allow the applications filed, these original side appeals are
filed by the appellant.
3.As all these original side appeals arise out of the common order passed, the
issues being one and the same though there are certain factual differences
among the defendants, we pass a common judgment.
4.Heard Mr.Ariyamasundaram, learned Senior Counsel for Mr.Arun C.Mohan,
learned counsel for the appellants in all these appeals and Mr.Harishankar,
learned counsel appearing for the respondent in OSA No.4 of 2020; Mr.Sathish
Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel for Mr.Jacab Kurian and Mr.Madhan Babu,
learned counsel for the Respondent in  14/73 http://www.judis.nic.in

of 2020 OSA Nos. 5 and 6 of 2020 and M/s BFS Legal & Hemanth Thadhani, learned
counsel for the respondent in OSA Nos.8 and 11 of 2020 respectively and
Mr.R.Sathishkumar, learned counsel for the respondent in OSA Nos.9 and 10 of
2020, perused the documents and written arguments filed.
5.Before venturing into the respective arguments of the learned counsel at the
Bar, we would like to summarise the legal principles governing the case.
6.Trade Marks Act, 1999: (Sections 28 and 29) 6.1.Chapter IV of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999, concerns with the effect of registration. Section 28 of the
Act thus confers a right of protection to the registered proprietor of a trade
mark. However, such a right is a qualified one, subject to the other
provisions of the Act. Subject to the other provisions of the Act, a
registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered
proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to its use in relation to the
goods or services in respect of which it is registered and to obtain relief
for infringement in the manner provided by the Act. We  15/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 need to make more emphasis on the words 'if
valid'. Only when a registered mark becomes valid, this protection would come
into play. It is a condition precedent before exercising the right conferred
by registration of a trade mark. This position has also been extended and
reiterated under sub section 2 of Section 28, which makes it mandatory that
such an exclusive right shall be subject to any conditions and limitations.
6.2.The literal and natural reading of Section 28, a right under it can be
exercised subject to the rigour of other provisions, such as, Sections 29 and
30 of the Act. Section 29 also does not give any absolute right. We do not
wish to discuss these provisions at length in view of the judgment rendered by
one of us (Justice M.M.Sundresh) in Banana Brand Works Pvt. Ltd., V. Kavan
Antani, Director, Bananabandy Network Private Limited (2016(4) CTC 647). We
would only quote the following paragraphs.
“12.2. Section 29 of the Act deals with infringement by two sets of entities.
Section 29(1) of the Act deals with a case of infringement through a mark,
which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation
to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
Resultantly, such a mark of the infringer would in all manner  16/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 likely to be taken as that of a registered
one. Thus, Section 29(1) of the Act speaks about the mark being identical or
deceptively similar in the same goods or services qua a registered mark. There
is no difficulty for a Court to decide an infringement under Section 29(1) of
the Act. It has to be seen as to whether the infringing mark is identical or
deceptively similar to the registered trade mark in relation to the goods or
services. Section 29(1) places on part the word “identical with deceptive
similarity”. Hence a distinction has to be made between a mere “similarity”
and a deceptive one.
12.3. The Courts are faced with more number of cases applicable to Section
29(2) of the Act onwards. Section 29(2) of the Act gives importance to two
words. They are, “identity” and “similarity”. Though they have to be seen in
the context of the provision by giving a natural and a reasonable
interpretation, the word “identity” is placed at a higher pedestal than
similarity. It becomes closer to the infringing mark than similarity. It
denotes a mark goods or service of a same kind in appearance, character or
quantity, without being identical. It is more to do with resemblance of one
trade mark to another. However, both cannot be the same and hence, there would
be certain independent factors attached to each of them. Thus, there involves
some degree of difference between the mark, goods, services of a infringer as
against the registered holder.
12.4. Section 29(2)(a) of the Act deals with “identity” with the registered
trade mark and “similarity” with the goods  17/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 or services. Thus, the word “identity” is attributable to the
registered trade mark as against the case of goods or services covered by such
registered trade mark. Therefore, a difference is shown between “identity” and
the “similarity”. Section 29(2)(b) of the Act speaks about similarity to the
registered trade mark and identity or similarity of the goods and services.
Here, similarity is used with respect to the registered trade mark, whereas
both identity and similarity are used with respect to the goods or services.
Coming to Section 29(2)(c) of the Act, it deals with identity of the
registered trade mark and identity of the goods and services.
12.5. In all these cases mentioned supra, infringement would occur when such
acts are likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or which is an
act associated with the registered trade marks. Therefore, the basis is
likelihood of causing confusion from the point of view of the public in
general. Hence, no actual confusion is necessary and it is relatable to an end
user. Similarly, with reference to the association with the registered mark
also what is sufficient is the likelihood. Therefore, if one reads all the
provisions together, then intention of the legislature is very clear that is
to protect the registered mark holder even in case of latter as what is
sufficient is only likelihood. Coming to sub section 3 of Section 29(2) of the
Act, it creates a statutory presumption in view of sub section 2(c) onwards a
likelihood of causing confusion on the part of the public. Now this is because
the word “identity” has been given more weightage  18/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 towards infringement as against “similarity”.
Therefore, once there is an identity between marks of a registered holder and
the other, the statutory presumption would follow the suit.
12.6. Sub Section 4 of Section 29 of the Act mandates compliance of all the
three sub clauses viz., a to c to constitute the infringement. Sub section 4
deals with a mark which is identical with or similar as the case of Section
29(1) of the Act, though the said provision deals with deceptive similarity.
However, in this case, the other two conditions are also to be satisfied.
However, Section 4 deals with goods or services, which are not similar to
those, for which, the trade mark is registered. This is subject to the further
condition that such a mark has got a reputation in India and the usage is
without due care involving undue advantage apart from detrimental to the
distinctive character or reputation of the registered trade mark. Therefore,
Section 29(4) of the Act can be pressed into service only when there exists a
reputation of the mark holder in India. It does not stop with that, but
proceeds to state that the usage of the mark is without “due cause” and by
taking “undue advantage of” or “detrimental to the distinctive character or
repute”. Therefore, there has to be a proof of undue care followed by other
facts, such as unfair advantage and being detrimental to the distinctive
character or reputation as the case may be. To succeed under these provisions,
a registered mark holder has to not only prove its  19/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 reputation, but the distinctive character
followed by undue advantage or detrimental activity without due cause. All
these factors are required to be proved by the registered mark holder. This is
for the reason that there is no similarity to the goods or services with the
registered trade marks.” 6.3.Thus, a registered trade mark holder has to prove
not only the reputation but the other incidental factors. However, even this
provision is subject to Section 30 of the Act.
7.SECTION 30:
The scope and ambit of Section 30 of the Act has been dealt with by one of us
(Justice M.M.Sundresh) in Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Vs.
Wockhardt Limited (2013 (56) PTC 558). The relationship between Sections 29
and 30 along with the scope and ambit has also been considered. We would
reiterate the following passage for better appreciation.
“5.6. Sections 28 to 30 of the the Trade Marks Act, 1999, deal with the effect
of registration under Chapter IV of the Act. In so far as Section 28 of the
Act is concerned, it deals with the rights conferred by registration. Section
28 of the Act specifically deals with the "exclusive" right under the Act.
Therefore, a registered  20/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of
2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 proprietor of
a trade mark can assert an exclusive right to use the trade mark under Section
28 of the Act. However, the said assertion is subject to two conditions. The
first condition is that it is "subject to other provisions of the Act". The
second condition is that it is subject to its "validity".
5.7. Now coming to Section 29 of the Act, it deals with an infringement of the
registered trade mark. Section 29 of the Act specifies that an infringement
would occur when an unregistered Proprietor uses a registered trade mark,
which is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or which is
likely to have an association with the registered trade mark. Therefore, if
one sees the object and reasons under Section 29 of the Act, it is clear that
it is meant to be used against the person, who is not entitled to use the said
trade mark under "law". This is required to constitute an infringement.
5.8. Now coming to Section 30 of the Act, it limits the effect of registered
trade mark. A perusal of Section 30 of the Act would show that Section 29 of
the Act is subjected to it. Therefore, Section 30 of the Act is an overriding
provision to Section 29 of the Act. However, the parameters stipulated under
Section 30 of the Act will have to be complied with. For example, in a case
where a party is using a registered trade mark belonging to another one, if it
is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters or
is detrimental to the distinctive character of the different trade mark, no
infringement would occur as it limits the effect of registered trade mark.
Similarly, when the usage is  21/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12
of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 indicative
of a kind, quality or a quantity, then there will not be any infringement
notwithstanding the registration.
5.9.While considering the statutory provisions, the Courts will have to read
them together to understand the intending purpose and object. Therefore, we
are of the considered view that Sections 28 to 30 of the Trade Marks Act,
1999, are to be read in connection with each other. Such a yardstick will have
to be adopted in view of the settled interpretative principle of harmonious
construction.
5.10.Accordingly, let us apply the facts to the provisions. The records would
show that the word "METOPROLAL" is a chemical component. It is "publici
juris". There are number of registered Proprietors having the prefix "METO".
The learned single Judge has also noted the said fact. Now all of them are
identified with the common name, in view of the chemical component. Hence, it
is not as if the respondent has infringed the said word "METO". It is already
in the public domain, even much prior to the application of the appellant.
Applying the said facts when we read Section 29 of the Act, we can safely come
to the conclusion that the limits on effect of the registered trade mark under
Section 30 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, would apply with all force.
Therefore, the exclusive right claimed by the appellant in pursuant to the
registration would no longer be available, in view of the fact that the word
'METO" is already "publici juris", thereby, giving protection under Section 30
of the Act. When Section 28 of the Act is not applicable, then consequently,
Section 29 of the Act also is not applicable. Even otherwise, Section 29 of
the Act is  22/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP
Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 subject to Section 30 of
the Act. As Section 28 of the Act is also subject to other provisions, it is
needless to state that it is also subject to Section 30 of the Act. Therefore,
looking from any angle, we have no hesitation in holding that there is no
infringement of the appellant's trade mark under Section 29 of the Trade Marks
Act, 1999.”
8\. Section 31:
8.1.Section 31 states that in all the legal proceedings relating to the
registered trade mark, the original registration shall be the prima facie
evidence of its validity. This provision also will have to be read in the
light of Section 30 of the Act. To put it differently, Section 31 does not
exclude Section 30. The power of the Civil Court is plenary in nature. It is
involved in an adjudicative process both in the interlocutory stage and the
final stage. Therefore, what is applicable at the final stage has to be made
applicable at the interlocutory stage. Thus, Section 31 is subject to Section
30 of the Act. It applies to the proceedings at all stages. There is a
difference between a civil suit and a legal proceeding under the Act. Under
the Act, the trade mark itself is questioned on its validity, whereas in a
suit its evidentiary value is assessed. A right is claimed based upon a
registered trade mark. Further, the presumption under Section 31 is a  23/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 rebuttable presumption. It can be rebutted
even in the interlocutory stage.
The word 'prima facie' mentioned under Section 31 of the Act cannot be
understood to mean that at the interlocutory stage, the Civil Court is
expected to hold always that a registered trade mark is valid. One cannot
confuse a statutory presumption of prima facie validation with an adjudicatory
process. We may note that Section 31 also comes under Chapter IV. Any
interpretation other than the one we have arrived at would make Sections 28 to
30 as redundant and otiose.
8.2.As the law governing grant of injunction is well settled, it is axiomatic
that once Court finds that there is an infringement of a registered trade
mark, an order of injunction has to follow. We may quote with profit the
following passage of the Apex Court in Midas Hygiene Industries Private
Limited and another V. Sudhir Bhatia and Others (2004(2) CTC 77(SC).
“The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either of
Trade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow.”
9.Passing Off:-
24/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 9.1.Passing Off principle has been settled
for now. Suffice it is to say that for a passing off action, one has to seek
common law remedy.
We do not wish to multiply the judgments except by quoting the decision
rendered in Maya Appliances Pvt. Ltd., Vs. Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances
Ltd.,(2017(2) CTC 742) by one of us (Justice M.M.Sundresh).
11.1. As the principle governing “passing off” is very often repeated, this
Court does not want to repeat, as it has been dealt with in extenso in BANANA
BRAND WORKS PVT. LTD., V. KAVAN ANTANI AND ANOTHER (2016 (4) Law Weekly
33) and in O.A.No.1102 of 2015 and A.No.6797 of 2015 in C.S.No.828 of 2015
dated 21.10.2016. Suffice it is to state that the fundamental principles
popularly called as “classic trinity” as enunciated in Jif Lemon's case (1991
All England Reporter 873) still continues to rule the field. Here is a
fruitful recapitulation of the given passages:
“7. PASSING OFF:-
7.1. An action for “passing off” also comes under the common law. An action
for “passing off” is much wider than an infringement. The principle governing
"passing off" has already been dealt with by this Court in BANANA BRAND WORKS
PVT. LTD., V. KAVAN ANTANI AND OTHERS ((2016) 4 Law Weekly 33), which reads as
follows.
“6.3. Ultimately, the Courts are concerned with the damages or their
likelihood. Therefore, absence of intention and the real damage cannot be the
factors  25/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428
to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 standing the way of getting an
order of protection. Fraud is not an absolutely necessary element and thus, a
mere absence of intention to deceive is not a defence. In a case of
infringement qua identity and similarity with the registered mark, the
requisite parameters are the same as passing off.
7\. Intention is not required:-
When we speak about misrepresentation, a narrow interpretation is not
required. It has to be seen and understood from the point of view of the
protection, such as, act of misrepresentation, though not necessarily
intentional, can be, by any one starting from the manufacturer to the
retailer. The reason is that such an act is attached to the goods or services
as the case may be. It is also attributable to the last of the transaction and
therefore, it should also be seen from the point of view of the end seller.
10\. PASSING OFF:-
The concept of “passing off” has already been dealt with by this Court in
A.Nos.1554 and 1555 of 2016 and O.A.Nos.1145 and 1146 of 2015 in C.S.No.854 of
2015 dated 30.06.2016, wherein it has been held as follows.
“8.1.Passing off is a concept in the domain of common law remedy. It offers
protection to a party, when the other makes an attempt to pass off his goods
through a misrepresentation, as  26/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to
12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 that of
the former. What is required in a passing off is the existence of a goodwill,
damage or injury to it and through representation. This fundamental principles
called as classical trinity has been enunciated in Jif Lemon's case (1991 All
England Reporter 873), which deduced the larger requirement enunciated in the
Advocate's case (ERVEN WARNINK V. TOWNEND & SONS LTD., ((1979) 2 ALL E.R. 927)
(See S.SYED MOHIDEEN V. P.SULOCHANA BAI ((2016) 2 Supreme Court Cases 683).
                                           8.    A party, who comes to the Court, has to
                                           establish     the   three    basic    requirements      as
                                           mentioned above, while seeking an                order of
protection. An actual injury is not a sine qua non and thus, likelihood of
damage would suffice. A misrepresentation by the defendant to the public may
or may not be intentional.
What is sufficient is that an action qua a defendant, which leads or likely to
lead a prospective customer to believe that the goods or services offered by
it are that of the plaintiff. Such a deception can either be proved on
evidence and if not by the decree of probability, of course, to the
satisfaction of the Court.” 7.2.The scope of passing off vis-a-vis an
infringement has been dealt with by the Apex Court in a recent judgment in
SYED MOHIDEEN MOHIDEEN V  27/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of
2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 P.SULOCHANA
BAI ((2016) 2 Supreme Court Cases 683). The following passage of the said
judgment is apposite.
31.1. Traditionally, passing off in common law is considered to be a right for
protection of goodwill in the business against misrepresentation caused in the
course of trade and for prevention of resultant damage on account of the said
misrepresentation. The three ingredients of passing off are goodwill,
misrepresentation and damage. These ingredients are considered to be classical
trinity under the law of passing off as per the speech of Lord Oliver laid
down in the case of Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc
MANU/UKHL/0012/1990 : (1990) 1 AllE.R. 873 which is more popularly known as
"Jif Lemon" case wherein the Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out
by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink v. Townend & Sons Ltd. [1979) AC 731, 742
(HL)] (the "Advocate Case") to three elements: (1) Goodwill owned by a trader,
(2) Misrepresentation and (3) Damage to goodwill. Thus, the passing off action
is essentially an action in deceit where the common law rule is that no person
is entitled to carry on his or her business on pretext that the said business
is of that of another. This Court has given its imprimatur to the above
principle in the case of Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah and Anr.
MANU/SC/0763/2001 : 2002 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 357 : (2002) 3 SCC 65. 31.2. The
applicability of the said principle can be seen as to which proprietor has
generated the goodwill by way of use of  28/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 the mark name in the business. The use of the mark/carrying on
business under the name confers the rights in favour of the person and
generates goodwill in the market. Accordingly, the latter user of the
mark/name or in the business cannot misrepresent his business as that of
business of the prior right holder. That is t he reason why essentially the
prior user is considered to be superior than that of any other rights.
Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which are based on
goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are independent to that of registered
rights. The mere fact that both prior user and subsequent user are registered
proprietors are irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the
goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is causing
misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and
reputation of the prior right holder/former user. That is the additional
reasoning that the statutory rights must pave the way for common law rights of
passing off.
32\. Thirdly, it is also recognized principle in common law jurisdiction that
passing off right is broader remedy than that of infringement. This is due to
the reason that the passing off doctrine operates on the general principle
that no person is entitled to represent his or her business as business of
other person. The said action in deceit is maintainable for diverse reasons
other than that of registered rights which are allocated rights under Recent
Civil Reports the Act. The authorities of other common law jurisdictions like
England more specifically  29/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of
2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 Kerry's Law
of Trademarks and Trade Names, Fourteenth Edition, Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell
South Asian Edition recognizes the principle that where trademark action
fails, passing off action may still succeed on the same evidence. This has
been explained by the learned Author by observing the following:--
15-033 "A claimant may fail to make out a case of infringement of a trade mark
for various reasons and may yet show that by imitating the mark claimed as a
trademark, or otherwise, the Defendant has done what is calculated to pass off
his goods as those of the claimant. A claim in "passing off' has generally
been added as a second string to actions for infringement, and has on occasion
succeeded where the claim for infringement has failed"
32.1. The same author also recognizes the principle that Trade Marks Act
affords no bar to the passing off action. This has been explained by the
learned Author as under:-- 15-034 "Subject to possibly one qualification,
nothing in the Trade Marks Act 1994 affects a trader's right against another
in an action for passing off. It is, therefore, no bar to an action for
passing off that the trade name, get up or any other of the badges identified
with the claimant's business, which are alleged to have been copies or
imitated by the Defendant, might have been, but are not registered as, trade
marks, even though the evidence is wholly addressed to what may be a mark
capable of registration. Again, it is no defense to passing off that the
Defendant's mark is registered. The Act offers advantages to those who
register their trade marks, but  30/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to
12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 imposes
no penalty upon those who do not. It is equally no bar to an action for
passing off that the false representation relied upon is an imitation of a
trade mark that is incapable of registration. A passing off action can even
lie against a registered proprietor of the mark sued upon. The fact that a
claimant is using a mark registered by another party (or even the Defendant)
does not of itself prevent goodwill being generated by the use of the mark, or
prevent such a claimant from relying on such goodwill in an action against the
registered proprietor. Such unregistered marks are frequently referred to as
"common law trade marks".
7.3. A person complaining of passing off has a broader remedy as against the
act of infringement for the reason that it involves deceit and confusion. For
the aforesaid purpose, a mere likelihood would be sufficient. Likewise, a
right against passing off can be asserted even as against a registered mark
holder and in the absence of a registration of a mark or a design as the case
may be in favour of the applicants. The said principle has also been
reiterated by the High Court of Delhi in the decision of the Full Bench in
MOHAN LAL, PROPRIETOR OF MOURYA INDUSTRIES V. SONA PAINT & HARDWARES(2013(55)
PTC 61).
7.4. Passing off is an action meant to protect and preserve the reputation of
a party. The said concept has also got an element of public interest as it
intends  31/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428
to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 to protect the public against
the fraudulent sale by way of imitation, which might indirectly affect the
quality of the product copied. In such a case, it is not absolutely necessary
for the applicants to prove long user to establish reputation and goodwill.
The test for likelihood of confusion is through the eyes of a man of imperfect
recollection with an ordinary memory. Incidentally, it can also be seen from
the point of view of the end user. In this context, the following paragraphs
of the Apex Court in SATYAM INFOWAY LTD., VS. SIFYNET SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD.,
((2004) 28 PTC 566) is apposite.
12\. The next question is would the principles of trade mark law and in
particular those relating to passing off apply? An action for passing off. as
the phrase "passing off itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from
passing off its goods or services to the public as that of the plaintiff's. It
is an action not only to preserve the reputation of the plaintiff but also to
safeguard the public. The defendant must have sold its goods or offered its
service in a manner which has deceived or would be likely to deceive the
public into thinking that the defendant's goods or services are the
plaintiff's. The action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive
trademark and the person who, if the word or name is an invented one. invents
and uses it. If two trade rivals claim to have individually invented the same
mark, then  32/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP
Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 the trader who is able
to establish prior user will succeed. The question is, as has been aptly put,
who gets these first? It is not essential for the plaintiff to prove long user
to establish reputation in a passing off action. It would depend upon the
volume of sales and extent of advertisement.
13\. The second element that must be established by a plaintiff in a passing
off action is misrepresentation by the defendant to the public. The word
misrepresentation does not mean that the plaintiff has to prove any malafide
intention on the part of the defendant. Of course, if the misrepresentation is
intentional, it might lead to an inference that the reputation of the
plaintiff is such that it is worth the defendant's while to cash in on it. An
innocent misrepresentation would be relevant only on the question of the
ultimate relief which would be granted to plaintiff. What has to be
established is the likelihood of confusion in the minds of the public, (the
word "public" being understood to mean actual or potential customers or users)
that the goods or services offered by the defendant are the goods or the
services of the plaintiff. In assessing the likelihood of such confusion the
courts must allow for the "imperfect recollection of a person of ordinary
memory"
29\. What is also important is that the respondent admittedly adopted the mark
after the appellant. The appellant is the prior user and has the right to
debar the respondent from eating into the goodwill it may have  33/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 built up in connection with the name.
30\. Another facet of passing off is the likelihood of confusion with possible
injury to the public and consequential loss to the appellant. The similarity
in the name may lead an unwary user of the internet of average intelligence
and imperfect recollection to assume a business connection between the two.
Such user may, while trying to access the information or services provided by
the appellant, put in that extra 'f' and be disappointed with the result.
Documents have been filed by the respondent directed at establishing that the
appellant name Sify was similar to other domain names such as Scifinet,
Scifi.com etc. The exercise has been undertaken by the respondent presumably
to show that the word 'Sify' is not an original word and that several marks
which were phonetically similar to the appellants' trade name are already
registered. We are not prepared to deny the appellant's claim merely on the
aforesaid basis. For one, none of the alleged previous registrants are before
us. For another, the word 'sci- fi is an abbreviation of 'science fiction' and
is phonetically dissimilar to the word Sify. (See Collins Dictionary of the
English Language).
7.5. A passing off action would lie where there exists a similarity of get up
between the products which in turn would satisfy the test of likelihood of
confusion and deceit. A useful reference can be made to the following passage
in RUSTON AND HORNBY LTD. V. ZAMINDARA ENGINEERING 34/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 CO. (AIR (1970) Supreme Court 1649).
“5. It very often happens that although the defendant is not using the trade
mark of the plaintiff, the get up of the defendant's goods may be so much like
the plaintiff's that a clear case of passing off would be proved. It is on the
contrary conceivable that although the defendant may be using the plaintiff's
mark the get up of the defendant's goods may be so different from the get up.
of the plaintiff's goods and the prices also may be so different that there
"would be no probability of deception of the public. Nevertheless, in an
action on the trade mark, that is to say, in an infringement action, an
injunction would issue as soon as it is proved that the: defendant is
improperly using the plaintiff's mark.
6\. The action for infringement is a statutory right. It is dependent upon the
validity of the registration and subject to. other restrictions laid down in
ss. 30, 34 and 35 of the Act. On the other hand the gist of a passing off
action iS that A is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B but
it is not necessary for B to prove that A did this knowingly or with any
intent to deceive. It is enough that the get-up of B's goods has become
distinctive of them and that there is. a probability of confusion between them
and the goods of A. No. case of actual deception nor any actual damage need be
proved.“ 7.6. While deciding a case of “passing off” with reference to the
similarity, the Court has to see the  35/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 products of both sides as a whole. This might include the shape, get
up, label, package and the colour scheme. If the combined features indicate a
similarity to a naked eye, the consequence will have to flow. In such a case,
the onus is on the respondent to give a plausible explanation to justify its
adoption. This onus will become more pronounced when the applicants are the
market leader and prior user. When we take about distinctiveness, it includes
that of the products as a whole as well as a single one. In other words, the
commonality governing the products along with the distinctiveness of a single
product are factors for consideration against a violator. Ultimately, the
Court has to sit in the arm chair of an end user and decide. So is the case
with distinctiveness. The substantial volume of sale is a primary indicator of
the distinctiveness of a product. However, these factors will have to be seen
on the facts of each case.
7.7. The concept of initial interest confusion would certainly constitute a
case of “passing off”. There need not be any evidence of actual confusion and
deception. In BAKER HUGHES LIMITED AND ANOTHER V. HIROO KHUSHALANI AND ANOTHER
(1998 (18) PTC 580 Del.), the High Court of Delhi has held as follows:
“54...........There can be an informed class of purchasers who have a degree
of knowledge and a sense of discrimination more  36/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 substantial than that of an ordinary purchaser, but the mere fact that
the customers are sophisticated, knowledgeable and discriminating does not
rule out the element of confusion if the trade marks/trade names/corporate
names of two companies are identical or if the similarity between them is
profound. In several cases it has been held that initial confusion is likely
to arise even amongst sophisticated and knowledgeable purchasers under a
mistaken belief that the two companies using the same corporate name, trading
name or style are inter-related. It is the awakened consumers who are more
aware of the modern business trends such as trade mark licensing, mergers,
franchising, etc. It is this class of buyers who are likely to think that
there is some sort of association between the products of two different
companies when they come across common or similar trade names or corporate
names or trading styles used by them. The sophistication of a buyer is no
guarantee against likely confusion. In some cases, however, it is also
possible that such a purchaser after having been misled into an initial
interest in a product manufactured by an imitator discovers his folly, but
this initial interest being based on confusion and deception can give rise to
a cause of action for the tort of passing off as the purchaser has been made
to think that there is some connection or nexus between the products and
business of two disparate companies. This view finds support from various
decisions gathered in Section 20.12 of the Filing Instructions 1988, Fall
Cumulative Supplement from Callmann 'Unfair Competition, Trademarks and
Monopolies'. This section reads as under:
37/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 "But even apart from the doctrine of greater
care, if the manner of purchasing becomes routine, the possibility of
confusion can arise notwithstanding the expertise of the purchasers (Layne-
Western Co. Vs. Fry, 174 F Supp 621 (CCPA 1960). The mere fact that all the
customers are discriminating technicians does not by itself insure against
confusion; being skilled in the relevant art does not necessarily preclude
confusion if the similarity between the marks is great (Wincharger Corpn. Vs.
Rinco, Inc., 297 F2d 261 (CCPA 1962). "The words 'sophisticated' and
'knowledgeable' are not talismans which, when invoked, act magically to
dissipate a likelihood of confusion. It must also be shown how the purchasers
react to trademarks, how observant and discriminating they are in practice, or
that the decision to purchase involves such careful consideration over such a
long period of time that even subtle differences are likely to result in a
recognition that different marks are involved before an irrevocable decision
is made" (Refreshment Mach., Inc. Vs. Reed Industries, Inc.,196 USPQ 840 (TTAB
1977)."
"In some cases it has been held that a different type of confusion, referred
to as "initial confusion," is likely to arise even among sophisticated
purchasers. As one Court has said: "by intentionally copying the trade mark of
another more established company, one company attempts to attract potential
customers based on the reputation and name built up by the first user, the
older company. The danger here is not that the sophisticated  38/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 purchaser [in the oil trading market] will
actually purchase from Pegasus Petroleum believing that he has purchased from
Mobil [Oil Co.]; the danger is that the purchaser will be misled into an
initial interest in Pegasus Petroleum based on a mistaken belief as to the two
companies' inter relationships [Mobil Oil Corp. Vs. Pegasus Petroleum Corp.,
229 USPQ 890].
It has also been suggested that sophisticated consumers, being more aware of
such modern business trends as trademark licensing and conglomerate mergers,
are more rather than less likely to suspect some association between disparate
companies or products when they see what appears to be one company's mark on
another's product [Lois Sportswear, USA, Inc. Vs. Levi Straus & Co., 230 USPQ
831, 837 (CA2, 1986)]."
55\. In John Hayter's case (supra) the Court failed to notice the principle
that even the informed, sophisticated and knowledgeable customers suffer from
initial confusion where the corporate names, trade names or trade marks of two
different companies are the same or similar to each other. Therefore, the view
expressed in the case does not commend to me and compels me to respectfully
depart from the same.
                                       7.8.      The      Apex     Court      in   MAHENDRA           &
                                  MAHENDRA         PAPER        MILLS        V.    MAHINDRA           &
MAHINDRA LTD., (AIR 2001 Supreme Court 117) held  39/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 as under.
“15.This question has been considered by different High Courts and this court
in umpteen cases from time to time. On analysis of the principles laid down in
the decisions, certain recognised parameters relating to the matter have
emerged. Without intending to be exhaustive some of the principles which are
accepted as well settled may be stated, thus, that whether there is a
likelihood of deception or confusion arising is a matter for decision by the
court, and no witness is entitled to say whether the mark is likely to deceive
or to cause confusion; that all factors which are likely to create or allay
deception or confusion must be considered in combination; that broadly
speaking, factors creating confusion would be, for example, the nature of the
market itself, the class of customers, the extent of the reputation, the trade
channels, the existence of any connection in course of trade, and others.”
7.9. Thus, while dealing with the case of passing off, the Court may not be
concerned with the trade mark of the parties, but the similarity involving the
get up of the goods as held by the Apex Court in RUSTON AND HORNBY LTD. V.
ZAMINDARA ENGINEERING CO.
(AIR (1970) Supreme Court 1649) stated supra.
7.10. There is a small difference between an act of “passing off” in general
and “product passing off”. In dealing with the product “passing off” apart
from the factors, such as, shape, get up, let out, package and colour scheme,
overall configuration/appearance are  40/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 relevant factors. The concept of novelty has to be seen in the context
of each case.
11.2. There are two facets of passing off, which we are concerned with in this
case. One is a “product passing off” and another is “initial interest
confusion”. We are concerned with the products of the applicants and the
respondent. In these two cases, it is not, as if the general principles will
have to be given a go-by. Therefore, it could have relevancy while dealing
with the facts of this case. When we deal with “product passing off”, we are
required to consider the two products of the parties concerned. These two
products will have to be seen with respect to the same-ness, similarity or
identity, as the case may be. However, in a case of a contravention of a
registration granted already, its effect, will also have to be seen through
the common law as well. While dealing with the product passing off, the
concept of prior user would certainly apply. However, the element of long user
may not be strictly necessary in all cases. For example, a newly introduced
product may attract the attention of huge customers by its quality and
uniqueness. In such a case, the question of period of time loses its
significance. An injunction for passing off does not lie automatically. For
example, the defendant succeeds through one of its defence under Section 19 of
the Act, such as a prior publication  41/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 having been made by the plaintiff over a design for which a protection
is sought for through the Court. To put it differently, when a design comes
under the public domain, it cannot be said that any subsequent user would be
violating the common law remedy by its usage. In such a case, the other
factors like intention, deceit, likelihood of confusion, apart from damage to
reputation, would come. There is a difference between deceit and likelihood of
confusion. A “deceit” is one out of intention. But a likelihood of confusion
may not be with such intention. Considering the same, it has been held by Lord
Denning in PARKER KNOLL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED ((1962) RPC 265) in the
following manner:
> "Secondly, 'to deceive' is one thing. To 'cause confusion' is another. The
> difference in this: When you deceive a man, you tell him a lie. You make a
> false representation to him and thereby cause him to believe a thing to be
> true which is false. You may not do it knowingly, or intentionally, but
> still you do it, and so you deceive him. But you may cause confusion without
> telling him a lie at all, and without making any false representation to
> him. You may indeed tell him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
> truth, but still you may cause confusion in his mind, not by any fault of
> yours, but because he has not the knowledge or ability to distinguish it
> from the other pieces of truth known to him or because he may not even take
> the trouble to do so."
42/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 11.3. This has been quoted with approval by
the Bombay High Court in M/S SELVEL INDUSTRIES AND ANOTHER VS. M/s OM PLAST
(INDIA) in Notice of Motion (L) No.1434 of 2016 in Suit (L) No.439 of 2016
dated 30th June/1st July 2016.
9.2. However, when a claim of passing off is made by the plaintiff being an
user on generic term, he must prove that it is beyond the mere use of a
generic name by the defendant.
10.The concept of initial interest confusion has to be seen in the context of
each case. It has to be assessed from the point of view of the registered mark
holder/prior user, the infringing party/tortfeasor and the consumer. This
concept is nothing but a facet of passing off.
11.DILUTION:-
Dilution would occur when a consumer is not in a confused state of mind, but
factually the plaintiff's mark is diluted.
12.Res-judicata and Estoppel:
43/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 These two principles are well known. A party
will have to plead and establish the existence of res-judicata and issue
estoppel. However, there is no need for a separate suit when parties act in
contravention of the issues decided. Such a plea cannot be raised in a
piecemeal manner by leaving out the joint tortfeasor, who was the principal
defendant in the earlier suit. However, an issue decided not on a conscious
consideration of relevant materials cannot be termed as a binding one. The
principles also would not act against the defendants, who were not parties to
the earlier proceedings. In the subsequent proceedings, if the Court comes to
the conclusion after considering the relevant materials in favour of some of
the defendants, who were not parties in the earlier one, then the other
defendants, notwithstanding the fact they were parties earlier, would also get
the benefit. This may be so, especially, when the ultimate relief was declined
in favour of the plaintiff even in the first proceeding.
13.Generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful trade marks:
13.1.These are different categories of terms governing trade mark protection.
Depending upon the category, in which the goods come, the  44/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 degree of protection would follow. These
categories may overlap each other because of the difference in usage over a
period of time. The word generic encompasses a whole group of things. Thus, it
is not specified, it is a genus, in which, a product is a specie. A generic
word can also be descriptive though they are not interchangeable all the time.
When a mark is generic, the chance of protection to the holder is very less
compared to descriptive. However, in a case where a generic term becomes
descriptive, its impact would not get diluted. Certainly, in both the cases,
the onus is heavily on the plaintiff who relies upon the mark.
13.2.When a trade mark is a product of imagination, thought and perspective,
it becomes suggestive. Whereas, it becomes descriptive when it conveys the
idea of the ingredients, qualities and characteristics of the goods. Thus,
when it becomes suggestive as against descriptive, there is no need for any
proof of secondary meaning. The validity of the mark would come at naught
where suggestion ends and description begins.
The terms 'arbitrary' and 'fanciful' are also borne out of such imagination
though there is no element of suggestion involved. It is the out and out
creation of the mark holder. In this connection, we would like to quote the
45/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440,
442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 decision rendered by one of us (Justice
M.M.Sundresh) in Hatsun Agro Product Ltd., Vs. Arokya Food Products (2016(5)
CTC 382).
“10. Generic and Descriptive:-
The words generic and descriptive are not inter- changeable. “Generic” would
mean general and it encompasses a whole group of things. To put it otherwise,
it is not specific. Therefore, the generic name is genes, which has different
species. The word “bird” is a genes and the words “eagle”, “crow” are species.
Once a word becomes generic, it looses its exclusivity qua a registered trade
mark. This is not a general principle though there are cases in which
protection would still be available. When once a word becomes generic, the
burden is much higher on the plaintiff to convince the Court for a prohibitory
order on the strength of his registered mark. It is much more onerous when the
defendant is in some other business. However, there is a difference between
the usage of generic work, which are having direct connection with the product
as against the other goods. For example, if the word “Rose” is used involving
in a trade dealing with the Roses, then there is a direct connection. In such
a case, it may be difficult for the plaintiff being a registered mark holder
to success on that score alone de horse other factors. The reason being, the
plaintiff might prevent the whole world from using the said name by a sheer
act of registration. When once we understand the general principle that a
registration is to protect the trade, the protection given would lead to
prohibit the others to use a generic word  46/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 adopting the nature or quality of goods cannot generally be accepted.
It is also contrary to the intention of the enactment. On the contrary, if the
word “rose” is used in a software business, then it would become a fanciful or
arbitrary application. It is for the reason that though the word is generic,
the protection comes for the particular business and it is the business that
is identified with the name and not otherwise. Therefore, such fanciful or
arbitrary words are entitled for protection as a general principle.” 13.3.In
Abercrombie & Fitch Company V. Hunting World Incorporated, 537 F.2d 4, it has
been observed as under.
“It will be useful at the outset to restate some basic principles of trademark
law, which, although they should be familiar, tend to become lost in a welter
of adjectives. The cases, and in some instances the Lanham Act, identify four
different categories of terms with respect to trademark protection. Arrayed in
an ascending order which roughly reflects their eligibility to trademark
status and the degree of protection accorded, these classes are (1) generic,
(2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. The lines of
demarcation, however, are not always bright. Moreover, the difficulties are
compounded because a term that is in one category for a particular product may
be in quite a different one for another,6 because a term may shift from one
category to another in light of differences in usage through time,7 because a
term may have one meaning to one group of  47/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 users and a different one to others,8 and because the same term may be
put to different uses with respect to a single product.9 In various ways, all
of these complications are involved in the instant case.
A generic term is one that refers, or has come to be understood as referring,
to the genus of which the particular product is a species. At common law
neither those terms which were generic nor those which were merely descriptive
could become valid trademarks, see Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. v. Clark, 80
U.S. (13 Wall.) 311, 323, 20 L.Ed. 581 (1872) ("Nor can a generic name, or a
name merely descriptive of an article or its qualities, ingredients, or
characteristics, be employed as a trademark and the exclusive use of it be
entitled to legal protection"). The same was true under the Trademark Act of
1905, Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co.,220 U.S. 446, 31 S.Ct.
456, 55 L.Ed. 536 (1911), except for marks which had been the subject of
exclusive use for ten years prior to its enactment, 33 Stat. 726.10 While, as
we shall see, p. ---- infra, the Lanham Act makes an important exception with
respect to those merely descriptive terms which have acquired secondary
meaning, see § 2(f), 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f), it offers no such exception for
generic marks. The Act provides for the cancellation of a registered mark if
at any time it "becomes the common descriptive name of an article or
substance," § 14(c). This means that even proof of secondary meaning, by
virtue of which some "merely descriptive" marks may be registered, cannot
transform a generic term into a  48/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to
12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 subject
for trademark. As explained in J. Kohnstam, Ltd. v. Louis Marx and Company,
280 F.2d 437, 440, 47 CCPA 1080 (1960), no matter how much money and effort
the user of a generic term has poured into promoting the sale of its
merchandise and what success it has achieved in securing public
identification, it cannot deprive competing manufacturers of the product of
the right to call an article by its name. See, accord, Application of
Preformed Line Products Co., 323 F.2d 1007, 51 CCPA 775 (1963); Weiss Noodle
Co. v. Golden Cracknel and Specialty Co., 290 F.2d 845, 48 CCPA 1004 (1961);
Application of Searle & Co., 360 F.2d 650, 53 CCPA 1192 (1966). We have
recently had occasion to apply this doctrine of the impossibility of achieving
trademark protection for a generic term, CES Publishing Corp. v. St. Regis
Publications, Inc., 531 F.2d 11 (1975). The pervasiveness of the principle is
illustrated by a series of well known cases holding that when a suggestive or
fanciful term has become generic as a result of a manufacturer's own
advertising efforts, trademark protection will be denied save for those
markets where the term still has not become generic and a secondary meaning
has been shown to continue. Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505 (2 Cir.
1921) (L. Hand, D. J. ); DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products Co., 85 F.2d
75 (2 Cir.) (A. N. Hand, C. J. ), cert. denied, 299 U.S. 601, 57 S.Ct. 194, 81
L.Ed. 443 (1936); King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries, 1958).
Cir. 1963). A term may thus be generic in one market  49/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 and descriptive or suggestive or fanciful in
another. The term which is descriptive but not generic11 stands on a better
basis. Although § 2(e) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1052, forbids the
registration of a mark which, when applied to the goods of the applicant, is
"merely descriptive," § 2(f) removes a considerable part of the sting by
providing that "except as expressly excluded in paragraphs (a)-(d) of this
section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used
by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in
commerce" and that the Commissioner may accept, as prima facie evidence that
the mark has become distinctive, proof of substantially exclusive and
continuous use of the mark applied to the applicant's goods for five years
preceding the application. As indicated in the cases cited in the discussion
of the unregistrability of generic terms, "common descriptive name," as used
in §§ 14(c) and 15(4), refers to generic terms applied to products and not to
terms that are "merely descriptive." In the former case any claim to an
exclusive right must be denied since this in effect would confer a monopoly
not only of the mark but of the product by rendering a competitor unable
effectively to name what it was endeavoring to sell. In the latter case the
law strikes the balance, with respect to registration, between the hardships
to a competitor in hampering the use of an appropriate word and those to the
owner who, having invested money and energy to endow a word with the good will
adhering to his enterprise, would be deprived of the fruits of his efforts.

http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 The category of "suggestive" marks was
spawned by the felt need to accord protection to marks that were neither
exactly descriptive on the one hand nor truly fanciful on the other a need
that was particularly acute because of the bar in the Trademark Act of 1905,
33 Stat. 724, 726, (with an exceedingly limited exception noted above) on the
registration of merely descriptive marks regardless of proof of secondary
meaning. See Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit Co., 54 U.S.App.D.C.
313, 297 F. 892 (1924). Having created the category the courts have had great
difficulty in defining it. Judge Learned Hand made the not very helpful
statement: It is quite impossible to get any rule out of the cases beyond
this: That the validity of the mark ends where suggestion ends and description
begins.
Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Fashionit Sweater Mills, Inc., 297 F. 247,
248 (2 Cir. 1923), aff'd per curiam, 4 F.2d 1018 (2 Cir. 1925) a statement
amply confirmed by comparing the list of terms held suggestive with those held
merely descriptive in 3 Callmann, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and
Monopolies § 71.2 (3d ed.). Another court has observed, somewhat more
usefully, that:
A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to
reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods. A term is descriptive if it
forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities or
characteristics of the goods. Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &
Manufacturers Inc., 295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968) a formulation deriving
51/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440,
442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 from General Shoe Corp. v. Rosen, 111
F.2d 95, 98 (4 Cir. 1940). Also useful is the approach taken by this court in
Aluminum Fabricating Co. of Pittsburgh v. Season-All Window Corp., 259 F.2d
314 (2 Cir. 1958), that the reason for restricting the protection accorded
descriptive terms, namely the undesirability of preventing an entrant from
using a descriptive term for his product, is much less forceful when the
trademark is a suggestive word since, as Judge Lumbard wrote, 259 F.2d at 317:
The English language has a wealth of synonyms and related words with which to
describe the qualities which manufacturers may wish to claim for their
products and the ingenuity of the public relations profession supplies new
words and slogans as they are needed.
If a term is suggestive, it is entitled to registration without proof of
secondary meaning. Moreover, as held in the Season- All case, the decision of
the Patent Office to register a mark without requiring proof of secondary
meaning affords a rebuttable presumption that the mark is suggestive or
arbitrary or fanciful rather than merely descriptive. It need hardly be added
that fanciful or arbitrary terms enjoy all the rights accorded to suggestive
terms as marks without the need of debating whether the term is "merely
descriptive" and with ease of establishing infringement.
In the light of these principles we must proceed to a decision of this case.

14.Scope of Interference:
14.1.When the Court of first instance considered the relevant materials and
passed an order at the interlocutory stage, the appellate Court is not
expected to reassess it and substitute its views unless an error is apparent.
The following is the law laid down by the Apex Court in Transmission
Corporation of A.P., Ltd., and others Vs. Lanco Kondapalli Power (P) Ltd.,
((2006) 1 Supreme Court Cases 540).
45\. In 'A Treatise on The Law Governing Injunctions' by Spelling and Lewis'
it is stated :
"Sec. 8. Conflict and Loss of Jurisdiction. Where a court having general
jurisdiction and having acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter has issued
an injunction, a court of concurrent jurisdiction will usually refuse to
interfere by issuance of a second injunction. There is no established rule of
exclusion which would deprive a court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction
because of the issuance of an injunction between the same parties appertaining
to the same subject-matter, but there is what may properly be termed a
judicial comity on the subject. And even where it is a case of one court
having refused to grant an injunction, while such refusal does not exclude
another coordinate court or judge from jurisdiction, yet the granting of the
injunction by a second judge may lead to complications and retaliatory action"
46\. The High Court, therefore, while noticing the interim order  53/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 passed in the writ proceedings may have the
said principle in mind.
47\. In Wander Ltd. and Another v. Antox India P. Ltd. [(1990) Supp. SCC 727],
it is stated :
"The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of
parties which may appear on a prima facie case. The court also, in restraining
a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the
plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant
consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or
whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations
somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet
to commence his enterprise, are attracted."
14.2.The Apex Court in Skyline Education Institute (India) Private Ltd., V.
S.L.Vaswani and another (Civil Appeal Nos.1360-1361 of 2005 dated 05.01.2010)
held as follows.
13\. We have thoughtfully considered the entire matter. Before pronouncing
upon the tenability or otherwise of the appellant's prayer for restraining the
respondents from using the word `Skyline' for the Institute of Engineering and
Technology established by them, we consider it necessary to observe that as
the suit filed by the appellant is pending trial and issues raised by the
parties are yet to be decided, the High Court rightly  54/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 considered and decided the appellant's prayer
for temporary injunction only on the basis of the undisputed facts and the
material placed before the learned Single Judge and unless this Court comes to
the conclusion that the discretion exercised by the High Court in refusing to
entertain the appellant's prayer for temporary injunction is vitiated by an
error apparent or perversity and manifest injustice has been done to it, there
will be no warrant for exercise of power under Article 136 of the
Constitution. In Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd 1990 (Supp.) SCC 727, this
Court was called upon to determine the scope of appellate court's power to
interfere with the discretion exercised by the court of first instance in
granting or refusing the prayer for temporary injunction. The facts of that
case were that in the suit filed by it, respondent-Antox India (P) Ltd. had
prayed for restraining the appellant from using registered trade mark `Cal-
De-Ce'. The learned Single Judge of the High Court refused to entertain the
respondent's prayer but on reconsideration of the matter the Division Bench
passed an order of injunction. This Court reversed the order of the Division
Bench and observed:
> "... In such appeals, the appellate court will not interfere with the
> exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its own
> discretion except where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised
> arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored
> the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory
> injunctions. An appeal  55/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of
> 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 against
> exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court
> will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from

> reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not
> be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal
> solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage
> it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been
> exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact
> that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify
> interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion."
14\. The proposition of law laid down in Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd
(supra) was reiterated in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation (supra) in
which this Court considered the correctness of an order of temporary
injunction passed by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in a
suit filed by the respondents to restrain defendants from manufacturing,
selling, advertising or in any way using the trade mark `Whirlpool' or any
other trade mark deceptively or confusingly similar to the trade mark
`Whirlpool' in respect of their goods. The claim of the plaintiffs-respondents
was based on prior user of the mark `Whirlpool'. After considering the rival
pleadings and material placed before him, the learned Single Judge granted
temporary injunction. The Division Bench confirmed that order and dismissed
the appeal preferred by the appellant. This  56/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 Court, declined to interfere with the discretion exercised by the
learned Single Judge and Division Bench of the High Court and held:
> "Injunction is a relief in equity and is based on equitable principles. On
> the above concurrent findings, the weight of equity at this stage is in
> favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. It has also to be borne
> in mind that a mark in the form of a word which is not a derivative of the
> product, points to the source of the product. The mark/name `WHIRLPOOL' is
> associated for long, much prior to the defendants' application in 1986 with
> the Whirlpool Corporation, Plaintiff 1. In view of the prior user of the
> mark by Plaintiff 1 and its trans-border reputation extending to India, the
> trade mark `WHIRLPOOL' gives an indication of the origin of the goods as
> emanating from or relating to the Whirlpool Corporation, Plaintiff 1. The
> High Court has recorded its satisfaction that use of the `WHIRLPOOL' mark by
> the defendants indicates prima facie an intention to pass off the
> defendants' washing machines as those of the plaintiffs or at least the
> likelihood of the buyers being confused or misled into that belief."
15\. A somewhat similar view was expressed in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v.
Cadila Pharmaceuticals 2001 (5) SCC 73.
16\. The ratio of the above noted judgments is that once the court of  57/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 first instance exercises its discretion to
grant or refuse to grant relief of temporary injunction and the said exercise
of discretion is based upon objective consideration of the material placed
before the court and is supported by cogent reasons, the appellate court will
be loath to interfere simply because on a de novo consideration of the matter
it is possible for the appellate court to form a different opinion on the
issues of prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable injury and
equity.
14.3.In Neon Laboratories Ltd., Vs. Medical Technologies Ltd and others (Civil
Appeal No.1018 of 2006 dated 05.10.2015), the Apex Court has observed as
under.
“3 This Court does not normally entertain appeals against interlocutory
orders. In the case of trademarks, however, keeping in perspective the endemic
delay in concluding cases/suits in India because of the exponentially
increasing docket explosion, temporary ad interim injunctions are of far
reaching consequences, oftentimes effectively deciding the lis and the
disputes themselves. Possibly for this reason ‘Leave’ has already been granted
in the present Appeal. However, it is now well entrenched in our jurisprudence
that the Appellate Court should not flimsily, whimsically or lightly interfere
in the exercise of discretion by a subordinate court unless such exercise is
palpably perverse. Perversity can pertain to the  58/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 understanding of law or the appreciation of
pleadings or evidence. We shall restrict ourselves to reference in Wander Ltd.
v. Antox India P. Ltd. 1990 Supp SCC 727, wherein it has been adumbrated that
the Appellate Court ought not to “reassess the material and seek to reach a
conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one
reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate
court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of
discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the
matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the
discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial
manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may
not justify interference with the trial court’s exercise of discretion”. We
shall be careful not to transgress these frontiers.
14.4.In Wockhardt Limited V. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and another (Civil
Appeal No.9844 of 2018 dated 12.09.2018), the Apex Court has held as follows:
> “(11) We are of the view that this is not a case where Wander Ltd. (supra)
> has not been heeded. On the contrary, the Division Bench has interfered on a
> matter of principle, pointing out errors of law by the learned Single
> Judge.”  59/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP
> Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020
> 15.Having considered the relevant principles of law, let us summarise the
> submissions at the Bar.
> 16.Submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant:
The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant submits that the
learned single Judge has not considered the scope of Section 31 of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999. The findings rendered both by the learned single Judge on the
earlier occasion and the Division Bench have not been understood in the
correct perspective. The aforesaid findings would operate on the principle of
res judicata and issue of estoppel. There is no need to rearray Google India
Private Limited as party defendant. It has stated that it has not violated the
law. A contempt action has also been initiated against it. There is an element
of initial interest confusion that would arise in the case. The appellant has
been forced to bid and pay the higher costs for its own trademark due to the
defendants bidding for the same. The appellant is the prior user having
substantial reputation.
Therefore, even assuming the words are generic and descriptive, the appellant
has acquired the secondary meaning. A clear case of dilution made out. The
respondents cannot be allowed to ride on the reputed mark  60/73

443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 of the appellant. In view of the objections
raised by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents placing reliance
upon the documents filed by the appellant itself, the learned Senior Counsel
has fairly submitted that the following reliefs may be considered by this
court.
1.That the respondent be restrained from entering into any arrangement with
Google such that when the Appellant's registered trademarks are searched by a
user, the respondent's website appears?
2.That the respondent be restrained from displaying in any manner the
trademarks of the appellant on the respondent's websites or advertisements?

17.The Submissions of the Respondents:
The learned Senior Counsel appearing for some of the respondents submits that
the trademark registered is both generic and descriptive. A mere registration
per se may not give legal right. Sections 17, 28 and 29 of the Trademarks Act
are subject to limitations. Section 31 of the Act cannot  62/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 get over the limitations. Neither any issue
of estoppel involved nor res judicata would arise. We are dealing with the
case where the users are tech-savvy. Even in the typed set of papers filed by
the appellant in page Nos.161 and 167, it is only its name which comes first
either by using its trade mark or the generic and descriptive names.
Ultimately, the consumer will have to get into the website of the defendants.
What the appellant challenges is the policy of the Google and the appellant at
best could have filed applications in the pending suit. The injunction
applications in the earlier round of litigation were dismissed. The order of
the Apex Court has not been violated. If that is the case, the remedy open to
the appellant is to file contempt. One has to see the case from the view of
the working mechanism of 'Google', interest of the consumer and the nature of
competition leading to a situation of monopoly being exercised. The
defendants' names come below the appellant's. One of the defendants does not
even use all the name of the appellant's mark as alleged. The suit is not
maintainable by leaving out the main tortfeasor. A mere registration per se
will not give absolute monopoly to the appellant. In support of their
contentions, the learned Senior Counsel has made reliance upon the following
decisions.

18.DISCUSSION:-
18.1.As stated above, this is a second round of litigation against some of the
defendants excluding the fourth defendant in the earlier suit  64/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 viz., Google India Private Limited. There is
no reason as to why such entity is left out deliberately, especially, when it
had taken a specific plea that it is following the law correctly. If a
contempt petition is stated to be filed against Google, then, it is not open
to the appellant to contend to the contrary that it is not a necessary party.
If some of the defendants, who were parties to the earlier suit, continue to
violate the orders passed, the remedy lies elsewhere. Thus, we are in
respectful agreement with the order of the learned single Judge in this
regard. The consumer is Tech-
savvy. He knows the importance of 'AdWord' and the search terms. We cannot get
into the mind of the consumer and expect him to use different search terms.
Obviously, the consumer is expected to use such term, which he is familiar
with. Such a familiarity is with respect to the language, religion,
caste/community, the place and the subject. 'Google' has founded its own
policy, which we have noted already. The program is such, it is bound to
create more options by search engine optimization and search engine marketing.
These are part and parcel of the online business platform. The key words are
nothing but tools. In creating the  65/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4
to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020
optimization while facilitating the marketing, the idea is to have a common
platform for the identical products or service. Whether that policy is right
or wrong is certainly a matter for consideration in the earlier suit. The
orders passed in the earlier suit did not enure to the benefit of the
appellant. Perhaps, that is exactly the reason why the present suit has been
filed. It is nothing but an extension of the earlier suit with few new
defendants. Perhaps, the appellant could have sought for appropriate relief in
the first suit as subsequent events can also be taken note of when they
happened pending the suit. Unfortunately, this has not been done so and that
too, without the presence of the primary actor viz., 'Google'. This is nothing
but an attempt to set at naught its policy in it absence.
18.2.In the scope and ambit of Sections 29 and 31 of the Act, we have
discussed already. Even the appellant has admitted that if the words 'Tamil-
Matrimony' broken into two and used separately, it would not have any
objection. We are not concerned with the import of Section 17 of the Act.
Rather, the concern is with respect to Sections 28 to 31 of the  66/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 Act. Section 32 of the Act also will not come
into play as we do not find any distinctiveness involved.
18.3.In the case on hand, the appellant has conveniently registered all
similar names spanning across the entire country. This may be a business
prudence. It certainly will not give a distinct advantage when the defendants
seek to use them in a different way. Here is a case where the defendants did
not seek to use the trade mark of the appellant per se.
Rather they want to get into the platform from which the consumer can choose
the respective website. The grievance of the appellant that it has been forced
to make more demand by the 'Adwords' chosen by the defendants cannot be
countenanced, particularly, in the business of Google Private India Limited.
There is no need for it to pay the amount when there is no challenge made to
the policy adopted by it. Similarly in the website of some of the defendants,
the words 'Tamil Matrimony' and similar words in nature have been shown. But
one has to see the content of it. They only facilitate the consumer about the
nature of the service offered. Here again, it differs from case to case. After
all, a consumer is  67/73 http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 &
CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 expected to use
consciously the website he or she wants.
18.4.We may also note that all the parties are doing the same business. In
fact, one of the defendants is doing a voluntary service either by using
'AdWord' or trade mark of the appellant. Its name alone comes first. The
documents filed by the appellant would indicate the abovesaid factum. That is
the reason why the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant fairly
modified the prayer sought for.
18.5.We do not find any 'infringement' or 'passing off' involved.
Once we hold that the trade mark used by the appellant is generic and
descriptive in nature, the entire scenario changes. The ingredients of
'passing off' is also not made out. Certainly, the appellant seeks to have a
monopoly throughout the country by mere registration of the trade marks.
Ultimately, one has to see from the perspective of the consumer as well.
Granting an order of injunction would amount to set aside the very policy that
is being adopted by 'Google'. There is no initial interest  68/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 confusion or dilution that would arise in
this case. The consumer is knowledgeable and tech-savvy. He knows what he
wants and what he is doing. In fact, as a competitor, the procedure adopted
would only help the appellant, if one agrees with it that it has established
its reputation and thus, become the forerunner and the market leader.
18.6.We do not find any likelihood of confusion involved. A user is
consciously expected to go into the website of the party either the appellant
or the defendants. Therefore, at that point of time, he makes the decision
consciously. If the contention of the appellant is accepted, the search
results shall contain only the appellant's website alone. It is certainly
contrary to the established functioning of the internet.
18.7.One cannot expect the consumer to use only the particular words as
'AdWords'. After all, the word 'Matrimony' is a most common word in the field
of marriage. Even before the advent of internet, the newspapers used to carry
matrimony columns. When the general public understand the words in a
particular way, a different meaning must be  69/73 http://www.judis.nic.in
O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442, 443, 445, 446, 448 & 449
of 2020 given. The appellant has not demonstrated that it has attained the
secondary meaning especially when the nature of trade and business is in tune
with the natural meaning of the word. The word Tamil which depicts the
language gives a certain identity. A combination of these two words is one of
absolute necessity to cull out the information required. As stated, this is
the very essence of search engine optimization and marketing.
18.8.The learned single Judge has considered the matter in extenso.
Accordingly, he came to the correct conclusion after assessing the materials
placed before him. We do not find any acceptable reason to differ with the
views expressed especially in the light of the judgments referred above on the
scope of the Appellate Court in reassessing the materials and findings
rendered by the Court of first instance.
18.9.Though the learned counsel at the Bar made reliance upon number of
judgments, we are not inclined to go into the same as there is no difficulty
in appreciating the principle of law laid down therein. Neither  70/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 those judgments nor that of the Division
Bench which dealt with the issue on the earlier occasion would entitle the
appellant to get the orders of injunction against the defendants, who were
arrayed as such earlier and now. Ultimately, even on the earlier occasion, the
relief sought for has been declined.
18.10.The principal of Res-judicata and issue of estoppel are not available in
the case. We do not think that the appellant is entitled to succeed based upon
the findings rendered by the Division Bench on the earlier occasion.
18.11.For the alleged involvement of violation by the 'Google', a fresh suit
cannot be the remedy and that too, against the new defendants. Even against
the earlier defendants, who were also parties to the present suit, the
appellant's remedy lies in the previous suit. Even on merit, we do not find
anything adverse in favour of the defendants to the extent of entitling the
appellant in getting the interim order. After all, the injunctions was
declined on the earlier occasion except to a very  71/73
http://www.judis.nic.in O.S.A.Nos.4 to 12 of 2020 & CMP Nos.428 to 440, 442,
443, 445, 446, 448 & 449 of 2020 limited extent. When once the Apex Court has
observed that the suit has to be expedited and the issues decided, the
appellant ought not to have filed the present one. In fact, the defendants
contended that there is no other way except to use the same 'AdWords'.
18.12.Thus, looking from any perspective, we do not find any error warranting
interference with the order passed by the learned single Judge.
Accordingly, the Original Side Appeals stand dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, connected civil miscellaneous petitions are also dismissed.
