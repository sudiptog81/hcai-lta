jurisdiction was raised in the written statement. Section 20 of the Code of
Civil Procedure is also referred to therein. The specific reasons as to why
the court lacks territorial jurisdiction are not stated in the written
statement, submits the counsel for the plaintiff. It is true that at the time
when the application for temporary injunction and appeal therefrom were
considered, the question of lack of territorial jurisdiction was not raised.
But that does not mean that the defendants have waived the right to raise that
contention in the written statement. Therefore, I reject the plea of waiver
raised by the plaintiff. C.R.P.No.1417/2004 13
14\. The court below held in the order impugned that the suit as such is
maintainable before the District Court, Kottayam. That finding is not correct
in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court referred to above. Accordingly,
the order passed by the court below is set aside. The plaintiff is given
liberty to amend the plaint, so that the suit will be maintainable before the
District Court, Kottayam, in the light of the principles laid down by the
Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions. When an application is filed for

                              O R D E R
The defendants in O.S.No.2 of 2001, on the file of the court of the District
Judge, Kottayam, challenge the order dated 6.10.2004 in I.A.No.322 of 2004 in
O.S.No.2 of 2001, by which the court below held that it has got territorial
jurisdiction to try the suit.
2\. The suit was filed by the respondent claiming reliefs under the Copyright
Act, 1957 and The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The plaintiff also
sought for reliefs alleging that there was passing off the goods of the
plaintiff as the goods of the defendants.
3\. It is stated that an interim injunction was granted in favour of the
plaintiff. The defendants challenged that order in C.M.A.No.52 of 2003 before
the High Court. The C.R.P.No.1417/2004 2 C.M.A. was disposed of directing the
trial court to dispose of the suit.
4\. Thereafter, the defendants filed I.A.No.322 of 2004 to try the question of
territorial jurisdiction as a preliminary issue. The defendants raised a
contention that the District Court, Kottayam has no territorial jurisdiction
to try the suit. The court below dismissed the application by the order dated
22.3.2004. That order was challenged in C.R.P.No.363 of 2004\. This Court
allowed the revision. The trial court was directed to decide the issue of
territorial jurisdiction afresh.
5\. Thereafter, the trial court passed the order dated 6th October, 2004
holding that it has territorial jurisdiction to try the suit. The said order
is challenged by the defendants in this revision. The court below held that in
view of Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957 the suit is maintainable before
the District Court, Kottayam.
C.R.P.No.1417/2004 3
6\. Sri.R.D.Shenoy, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners
submitted that the order passed by the court below is liable to be set aside
in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court in M/s.Dhodha House vs.
S.K.Maingi (AIR 2006 Supreme Court 730) = (JT 2006(1) SC 123) and Dabur India
Ltd. vs. K.R. Industries (AIR 2008 Supreme Court 3123) = 2008 (10) SCC 595.
The learned senior counsel also referred to the decisions in Kurivalli
Lingayya Setty vs. Sitharam Agarwala and another (AIR 1955 Madras 595),
Laxmikumar Srinivas Das vs. Krishnaram Baldev Bank, Lashkar and another (AIR
1954 Madhya Bharat 156), M/s.Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Allergan Inc. (AIR
2007 Delhi 108) and Dharampal Premchand Ltd. vs. Golden Tobacco Products (AIR
2007 Delhi 266).
7\. Sri.Narendra Kumar, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
submitted that the plea of lack of territorial C.R.P.No.1417/2004 4
jurisdiction is not available now to the defendants as they shall be deemed to
have waived that contention. It is pointed out that when the application for
temporary injunction and the appeal therefrom were being considered, the
defendants did not raise the contention that the court has no territorial
jurisdiction. A direction was issued by the High Court in C.M.A.No.52 of 2003
to dispose of the suit expeditiously. Only at that juncture, I.A.No.322 of
2004 was filed praying for deciding the question of lack of territorial
jurisdiction as a preliminary issue. The counsel relied on the decisions in
Hira Lal Patni vs. Sri Kali Nath (AIR 1962 Supreme Court 199) and Bahrein
Petroleum Co. Ltd. vs. P.J.Pappu and another (AIR 1966 Supreme Court 634) in
support of this contention.
8\. Sub Section 2 of Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957 reads thus :
> "(2) For the purpose of Sub Section (1), a "District Court having
> jurisdiction" shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the
> C.R.P.No.1417/2004 5 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or any other
> law for the time being in force include a District Court within the local
> limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or
> other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or other proceeding or,
> where there are more than one such persons, any of them actually and
> voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain."
> There is no similar provision in the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.
> Therefore, the territorial jurisdiction in so far as it relates to the
> relief under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 has to be considered
> with reference to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. There is no
> case for the plaintiff that the District Court, Kottayam would have
> jurisdiction, if Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applied.
9\. In M/s.Dhodha House vs. S.K.Maingi (AIR 2006 C.R.P.No.1417/2004 6 Supreme
Court 730), the Supreme Court held thus :
> "45. The short question which arises for consideration is as to whether
> causes of action in terms of both the 1957 Act and the 1958 Act although may
> be different, would (enable?) a suit to be maintainable in a court only
> because it has the jurisdiction to entertain the same in terms of Section
> 62(2) of the 1957 Act?
> 46\. A cause of action in a given case both under the 1957 Act as also under
> the 1958 Act may be overlapping to some extent. The territorial jurisdiction
> conferred upon the court in terms of the provisions of the Code of Civil
> Procedure indisputably shall apply to a suit or proceeding under the 1957
> Act as also the 1958 Act. Sub Section (2) of Section 62 of the 1957 Act
> provides for an additional forum. Such additional forum was provided so as
> to enable the author to file a suit who may not otherwise be in a position
> to file a suit at different places where his copyright C.R.P.No.1417/2004 7
> was violated. The Parliament while enacting the Trade and Merchandise Marks
> Act in the year 1958 was aware of the provisions of the 1957 Act. It still
> did not choose to make a similar provision therein. Such an omission may be
> held to be a conscious action on the part of the Parliament. The intention
> of the Parliament in not providing for an additional forum in relation to
> the violation of the 1958 Act is, therefore, clear and explicit. The
> Parliament while enacting the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provided for such an
> additional forum by enacting Sub Section (2) of Section 134 of the Trade
> Marks Act. The court shall not, it is well-settled, readily presume the
> existence of jurisdiction of a court which was not conferred by the statute.
> For the purpose of attracting the jurisdiction of a court in terms of Sub
> Section (2) of Section 62 of the 1957 Act, the conditions precedent
> specified therein must be fulfilled, the requisites wherefor are that the
> plaintiff must actually and voluntarily reside to carry on business or
> personally work for gain.
> C.R.P.No.1417/2004 8
> 56\. For the purpose of invoking the jurisdiction of a court only because
> two causes of action joined in terms of the provisions of the Code of Civil
> Procedure, the same would not mean that thereby the jurisdiction can be
> conferred upon a court which had jurisdiction to try only the suit in
> respect of one cause of action and not the other. Recourse to the additional
> forum, however, in a given case, may be taken if both the causes of action
> arise within the jurisdiction of the court which otherwise had the necessary
> jurisdiction to decide all the issues."
> In M/s.Dhodha House vs. S.K.Maingi (AIR 2006 Supreme Court 730), the Supreme
> Court made it clear that the question as to whether in a case where cause of
> action arises under the 1957 Act and the violation of the provisions of the
> the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is only incidental, a composite suit will lie or
> not, did not arise in that case.
C.R.P.No.1417/2004 9
10\. In Dabur India Ltd. vs. K.R.Industries (AIR 2008 Supreme Court 3123), the
Supreme Court held thus :
"27. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the Parliament having inserted
Sub Section (2) in Section 62 of the 1957 Act, the jurisdiction of the court
thereunder would be wider than the one under Section 20 of the Code. The
object and reasons for enactment of Sub Section (2) of Section 62 would also
appear from the report of the Committee, as has been noticed by this Court
being a provision which as been specifically designed to confer an extra
benefit upon the authors who were not in a position to instate copyright
infringement proceeding before the courts. It is in the aforementioned context
the law laid down by this Court in paragraph 13 of Dhodha House (supra) must
be understood.
29\. What then would be meant by a composite suit? A composite suit would not
entitle a court to entertain a suit in respect C.R.P.No.1417/2004 10 whereof
it has no jurisdiction, territorial or otherwise. Order II, Rule 3 of the Code
specifically states so and, thus, there is no reason as to why the same should
be ignored. A composite suit within the provisions of the 1957 Act as
considered in Dhoda House (supra) therefore, would mean the suit which is
founded on infringement of a copyright and wherein the incidental power of the
court is required to be invoked. A plaintiff may seek a remedy which can
otherwise be granted by the court. It was that aspect of the matter which had
not been considered in Dhoda House (supra) but it never meant that two suits
having different causes of actions can be clubbed together as a composite
suit."
11\. In the the Trade Marks Act, 1999 a provision similar to Section 62(2) of
the Copyright Act, 1957 is available. However, the Trade Marks Act, 1999 came
into force only on 15.9.2003. The suit was filed in the year 2001. Therefore,
the Trade Marks Act, 1999 cannot be applied to the present case
C.R.P.No.1417/2004 11 for the purpose of deciding the question of territorial
jurisdiction.
12\. It cannot be disputed that under Section 62(2) of the Copyright Act, the
District Court, Kottayam has jurisdiction to try the suit in so far as it
relates to the reliefs under the Copyright Act and incidental matters. It is
also fairly clear that the reliefs prayed for by the plaintiff under the Trade
and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 would not be maintainable before the District
Court, Kottayam as that court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to
try the suit in respect of those reliefs. In the light of the decisions of the
Supreme Court referred to above, it is for the plaintiff to suitably amend the
plaint, so that the suit will be maintainable before the District Court,
Kottayam. An opportunity to the plaintiff to amend the plaint cannot be denied
in the facts and circumstances of the case. If an application for amendment is
filed by the plaintiff, the court C.R.P.No.1417/2004 12 below shall consider
the same and pass appropriate orders, after affording an opportunity of being
heard to both parties.
13\. I am not inclined to accept the contention raised by the learned counsel
appearing for the plaintiff that the plea of lack of territorial jurisdiction
was waived by the defendants. It is stated that the question of lack of
jurisdiction was raised in the written statement. Section 20 of the Code of
Civil Procedure is also referred to therein. The specific reasons as to why
the court lacks territorial jurisdiction are not stated in the written
statement, submits the counsel for the plaintiff. It is true that at the time
when the application for temporary injunction and appeal therefrom were
considered, the question of lack of territorial jurisdiction was not raised.
But that does not mean that the defendants have waived the right to raise that
contention in the written statement. Therefore, I reject the plea of waiver
raised by the plaintiff. C.R.P.No.1417/2004 13
14\. The court below held in the order impugned that the suit as such is
maintainable before the District Court, Kottayam. That finding is not correct
in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court referred to above. Accordingly,
the order passed by the court below is set aside. The plaintiff is given
liberty to amend the plaint, so that the suit will be maintainable before the
District Court, Kottayam, in the light of the principles laid down by the
Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions. When an application is filed for
amendment of the plaint, the court below shall consider the same on the
merits, after affording an opportunity of being heard to both sides.
The Civil Revision Petition is allowed as above.
