J.B.PARDIWALA Date : 01/10/2020 CAV JUDGMENT (PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE
J.B.PARDIWALA)
1\. This Appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent is at the instance of an
unsuccessful writ-applicant of a writ-application  Page 1 of 75 Downloaded on
: Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT and is directed
against the judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court
dated 28 th July 2020 in the Special Civil Application No.7804 of 2020, by
which the learned Single Judge rejected the writ-application filed by the
appellant herein.
2\. The facts giving rise to this Appeal may be summarised as under :
3\. The appellant herein came before this Court by filing the Special Civil
Application No.7804 of 2020, praying for the following reliefs:
> "(A) To issue appropriate writ, direction or order to quashing and set aside
> the Respondent's selection process whereby 50% the weightage is given to
> personal interview and only 25% CAT score which is produced in Annexure-B as

> (AA) To issue appropriate writ, order or direction to the Respondent to set
> aside the Respondent's selection process also on the ground of providing 10%
> weightage to AWT as compared to 25% weightage to CAT score and 15% weightage
> to the previous academic/professional score as being unjust, unreasonable,
> arbitrary, in contrary to settled legal position and also violative of
> Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India.
(AB) To issue appropriate writ, order or direction to the Respondent to revise
the final merit based selection list of  Page 2 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct
02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT the candidates for the course
of post graduate programme of the Respondent institute through CAT-2019 on the
basis of settled law which determines not more than 15% weightage to oral
interview on the basis of the questions which are directly connected with the
course/programme in question and to make admissions on the basis of such
revised final merit based list, in the interest of justice and equity.
(AC) To issue appropriate writ, order or direction to the Respondent to record
the oral interview of all the candidates for all the programmes and courses
and supply a copy thereof on demand by a candidate, in the interest of justice
and equity.
(B) Pending hearing, admission and final disposal of this petition, direct the
Respondent;
> 1\. To keep one seat vacant for admission to 2020- 2022 batch of PGP course;

4\. The appellant herein, along with 2,44,000 other students, appeared for the
Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management,
Kozhikode, in 2019 for the Post Graduate Programme in Management 2020-2022
batch. The appellant secured 206.86 marks in the CAT 2019 examination, thereby
securing 99.95 percentile. He secured a rank in the top 10 students across the
country.
5\. The appellant, thereafter, was shortlisted for the next round of
Analytical Written Test (AWT) and Personal Interview (PI) by the Institute. He
received a call-letter dated 6 th January 2020 for the purpose of appearing in
the AWT and PI. It is his case that he holds a certificate issued by the
Director, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, U.K., certifying
that he has completed a Strategic Professional ACCA Examination, which is an
internationally recognized and accepted qualification equivalent to the Indian
Chartered Accountant qualification.

JUDGMENT
6\. By an email dated 11th May 2020, the appellant was informed that he was
not selected nor wait-listed. As the Institute declined to disclose the marks
secured by the appellant, he issued a legal notice dated 11 th May 2020 and
sought for the following details :
> (a) Total score/grade under different heads of the last candidate in the
> merit list of the general category
> (b) Total score/grade under different heads of the last candidate in the
> wait list
> (c) Total score/grade under different heads of the petitioner.
> (d) Seats alloted to engineering and non-engineering candidates.
> (e) Average months' work experience of candidates selected.
7\. On 19th June 2020, the appellant was informed that his composite score is
0.630269, whereas the composite score of the last selected candidate was
0.657594 and that the last wait- listed candidate had a composite score of
0.645370. The trouble started over here. It is the case of the appellant that
the allotment of 50% weightage of marks to the Personal Interview (PI) is
something very unreasonable. It is his case that the allocation of only 25%
marks secured in the CAT examination leads to subjective and lack of
transparency in the admission process.

JUDGMENT
8\. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant came before this
Court by filing the writ-application. The learned Single Judge declined to
grant any relief to the appellant substantially on the ground that the
allotment of 50% of marks for the Personal Interview in the IIM at Ahmedabad
being the policy matter, the High Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction,
should not interfere. In other words, according to the learned Single Judge,
as it is a question of educational policy or an issue involving an academic
matter, the writ court should keep its hands off. We quote the relevant
observations of the learned Single Judge as under:
> "14. What has come forth during the course of arguments and hearing of the
> matter is that IIM, Ahmedabad conducts personal interviews in order to
> select the best candidates out of the pool of shortlisted candidates to its
> flagship management program (PGP). Personal interviews are a critical
> component in the admission process. Finding quality candidates to management
> program involves interacting with the candidates on a wide range of topics
> such as their academic background and clarity of concepts learnt in the
> undergraduate degree, learnings from work experience, logical reasoning and
> ability to frame coherent arguments, achievements and learning in co-
> curricular and extra-
curricular fields, awareness of national as well as international events, and
ability to communicate in English, among others. For the PGP Program, these
are essential characteristics of a management post-graduate who will in  Page

JUDGMENT the future become leader of an enterprise that can only be determined
during a personal meeting. As reproduced at the beginning of the judgement is
the message from the Chairperson of IIM, Ahmedabad which also makes it clear
that other than academically intelligent students, the institute also needs
candidates who can excel in wide range of areas beyond conventional business,
areas that seek knowledge and expertise in management.
15\. What therefore comes to the foray is that the admission policy of
respondent IIM, Ahmedabad is in the public domain at the time of beginning of
the admission process. It has to be kept in mind that as discussed above, the
course offered by IIM, Ahmedabad is not a mere professional degree course.
Here at the time of admission, not only the candidate's Intelligence Quotient
is assessed by way of CAT examination but also the Emotional Quotient by way
of Personal Interview. At the time when due weightage has to be given to CAT
score, the same has been done by giving it a weightage of 65% and when the
interview is to be given more weightage, it is also so done. It has to be kept
in mind that for an admission to IIM, Ahmedabad, a candidate's Emotional
Quotient is rather more important than the Intelligence Quotient. The CAT
score does measure a candidate's intelligence to an extent, the final
selection process is based on many qualities which are necessary for a
professional's career growth.
16\. The institute's selection process/admission process thus cannot be
faulted with as it can be seen that IIM,  Page 7 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct
02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT Ahmedabad offers studies in a
higher education course which cannot be compared to graduate degrees because
the course offered requires overall development of a candidate and the
intellectual ability of a candidate can be judged only on the basis of an
interview and not on the basis of a CAT score which includes a limited
assessment in the three Multiple Choice Questions phase which the candidate
undertakes. CAT score at best entitles the candidate to be short-listed for
further rigorous test for the admission process.
17\. So far as the contention that there is violation of Section 7(e) and
Section 8(3) of the IIM Act is concerned, Section 7(e) stipulates that the IIM
is obliged to conduct examinations and to establish processes for evaluation
and performance assessment through a fair and transparent system. Section 8(3)
of the IIM Act stipulates that every academic course or programme of study
shall be based on merit assessed to the transparent system and reasonable
criteria disclosed through the prospectus prior to the commencement of the
process of admission. From the discussions hereinabove, it cannot be said that
the said sections have been violated by the respondent Institute. The
prospectus has been very clear and the entire evaluation process has been
fairly explained therein.
18\. I would also agree with Mr. Chudgar's submission based on the judgements
cited by him that it is now pleaded by the petitioner that he is not selected
and such ignorance  Page 8 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT on the part of the petitioner that he was not
aware of the selection process is misconceived in view of the fact that the
prospectus was uploaded, reading of which would indicate that a categorical
assertion was made in the prospectus that it was important for the candidate
to read them carefully. When such specific instructions were laid down in the
prospectus, it is not proper for the petitioner now to turn around after
having found himself not been selected to challenge the selection process. The
petitioner has relied on the decision in the case of Dr. (Major) Meeta Sahai
(supra), relevant paragraph of the same is reproduced hereinbelow:
> "22. It is the responsibility of the Courts to interpret the text in a
> manner which eliminates any element of hardship, inconvenience, injustice,
> absurdity or anomaly. This principle of statutory construction has been
> approved by this Court in Modern School v. Union of India , by reiterating
> that a legislation must further its objectives and not create any confusion
> or friction in the system. If the ordinary meaning of the text of such law
> is non-conducive for the objects sought to be achieved, it must be
> interpreted accordingly to remedy such deficiency."
18.1 The decision relied upon by Mr. Pahwa would not help the petitioner
because in the above decision it was a case of misconstruction of statutory
rules which is not the case here. Here is a case where the petitioner
participated in the admission process being fully aware of the standards of
assessment laid down in the prospectus. The candidate like  Page 9 of 75
Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT the
petitioner who has himself undergone as stated in the petition an accredited
course like ACCA and has academically performed well should have understood
and should be treated to have accepted the admission process and the criteria
laid therein. Once having found from the prospectus that the final selection
is based on a diverse set of attributes which includes performances in CAT,
AWT and PI and having read such process of selection, on being unsuccessful,
to challenge the same also is a ground on which the petitioner does not
deserve any relief. Thus, the petitioner will have to accept the fact that he
was not selected for final admission at IIM, Ahmedabad as there are number of
other more meritorious candidates ahead of the petitioner.
19\. What also needs to be seen that the jurisdiction of the High Court is
well limited as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in All India Council for
Technical Education vs. Surinder Kumar Dhawan and Ors . [(2009) 11 SCC 726].
The Hon'ble Supreme Court expressed this principle as under :-
> "17. The role of statutory expert bodies on education and role of courts are
> well defined by a simple rule. If it is a question of educational policy or
> an issue involving academic matter, the courts keep their hands off. If any
> provision of law or principle of law has to be interpreted, applied or
> enforced, with reference to or connected with education, courts will step
> in. In J.P.

> Kulshrestha (Dr.) v. Allahabad University [(1980)3 SCC 418 : 1980 SCC (L&S)
> 436] this Court observed:
> "11. ... Judges must not rush in where even educationists fear to tread.
> ..."
> 20\. Thus, having found that the process of admission undergone and
> undertaken by the IIM, Ahmedabad being above board, as having so laid out in
> detail in the affidavit in reply and as so seen from the prospectus, and the
> limited scope of this court, coupled with the fact that different business

> not think it fit to interfere with the same, as no arbitrariness has been
> borne out, the apprehension of the petitioner that undue weightage has been
> given to interview and the student who has secured such a high CAT score
> failed to secure an admission and this process being unjust, is a submission
> which is misconceived."
9\. Being dissatisfied with the judgment and order passed by the learned
Single Judge, the appellant herein (original writ- applicant) is here before
this Court with the present Appeal.
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT :
10\. Mr.Navin Pahwa, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant
has filed his written submissions as under :
Page 11 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
1\. IIM ACT, 2017 All IIMs are governed by this Central Act. A cumulative
reading of Sections 17(j), 10(2), 11, 21, 23, 29, 32 and 34 would demonstrate
that the respondent is under direct control and supervision of the Central
Government and is therefore a "State" within the meaning of Art. 12 of the
Constitution of India.
 Section 7(e) and 8(3) of the Act, in particular, are relevant and therefore
are reproduced:-
> "7(e) to conduct examinations and to establish processes for evaluation and
> performance assessment through a fair and transparent system;
> 8(3) The admission to every academic course or programme of study in each
> Institute shall be based on merit assessed through transparent and
> reasonable criteria disclosed through its prospectus, prior to the
> commencement of the process of admission by such Institute:
 From the above provisions, it is therefore clear that respondent is under
statutory obligation to establish a process for evaluation and performance
assessment through a fair and transparent system .
Page 12 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
 Similarly, the admission to the IIM is to be based on merit assessed through
transparent and reasonable criteria disclosed through its prospectus prior to
the commencement of process of admission by such institute .
2\. Selection process is in violation of Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution
of India and also in violation of section 7(e) r/w. 8(3) of the IIM Act, 2017.
 The selection process of respondent IIM is produced at Page 39/48 of the
SCA. It is in two parts. In the first part, the respondent allocates 35 marks
to the score for the previous academic career i.e. from Class- 10th Standard
to Graduation and 65% marks are allocated to the score of CAT (Pg.43).
 The second part and the final selection process contain following allocation
(Pg.45).
                          Personal Interview          50%
                          AWT                         10%
                          CAT Score                   25%
                          Previous Academic Career    15%
                          Total                       100%
There are no marks allocated towards co-curricular and extra curricular
activities as per the prospectus.
Page 13 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
 Allocation of 50% marks towards Personal Interview (PI) as compared to only
25% to CAT Score is ex-facie arbitrary and violative of Art. 14 of the
Constitution of India.
 The Constitutional Bench Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ajay Hasia
(1981) 1 SCC 722 in terms observe :-
> "19. ... .... there can be no doubt that allocating 33 1/3 of the total
> marks for oral interview is plainly arbitrary and unreasonable. It is
> significant to note that even for selection of candidates for the Indian
> administrative service, the Indian Foreign Service and Indian Police
> Service, where the Personality of the candidate and his personal
> characteristics and traits are extremely relevant for the purpose of
> selection, the marks allocated for oral interview are 250 as against 1800
> marks for the written examination, constituting only 12.2% of the total
> marks taken into consideration for the purpose of making the selection. We
> must, therefore, regard the allocation of as high a percentage as 33 1/3 of
> the total marks for the oral interview as infecting the admission procedure
> with the vice of arbitrariness and selection of candidates made on the basis
> of such admission procedure cannot be sustained. ... ..."

JUDGMENT
"... ... we are of the view that, under the existing circumstances, allocation
of more than 15% of the total marks for the oral interview would be arbitrary
and unreasonable and would be liable to be struck down as constitutionally
invalid." (Pg.Z/7 to Z/11 of Appeal)  The Hon'ble Supreme Court again in
Liladhar (1981) 4 SCC 159 in Para 6 was pleased to make certain observations,
relevant of which are reproduced as under:-
> "6. ... .... In the case of admission to a college for instance, where the
> candidate's personality is yet to develop and it is too early to identify
> the personal qualities for which greater importance may have to be attached
> in later life, greater weight has per force to be given to performance in
> the written examination. The importance to be attached to the interview must
> be minimal. ... ...." (Pg.Z/11 of Appeal)  Again the constitutional bench
> of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Yadav (1985) 4 SCC 417
> while considering selection by PSC was pleased to observe thus :
> "26. ... ... It is therefore obvious that the allocation  Page 15 of 75
> Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT of
> such a high percentage of marks as 33.3% opens the door wide for
> arbitrariness and in order to diminish, if not eliminate, the risk of
> arbitrariness, the percentage needs to be reduced. ... ...
> ... .... .. But in any event, the marks allocated for viva voce test cannot
> be as high as 33.3%.
> 29\. ... ... We would therefore direct that in case of ex-service officers,
> having regard to the fact that they would ordinarily would be middle aged
> personalities fully developed, the percentage of marks allocated for viva
> voce test may be 25. Whatever selections are made by the Haryana Service
> Commission in the future shall be on the basis that the marks allocated for
> the viva voce test shall not exceed 12.2% in case of candidates belonging to
> general category and 25% in case of ex-service officers. ... ..."
>  The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ashok @ Somanna Gowda (1992) 1 SCC 28, while
> considering recruitment to service for the post of Assistant Engineer was
> pleased to observe as under :-
> "2. ... ... Further, the selections were made according to the Rules of 1973
> and this practice is being consistently followed for the last 17 years and
> there is no allegation of any malafides in the matter of the impugned
> selections. However, the  Page 16 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23
> IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT Rules are clearly in violation of the
> dictum of this Court in the above referred cases and in case the marks for

> before us were bound to be selected on the basis of the marks secured by
> them in interview, calculated on the basis of converting the same to 15% of
> the total marks.... ... ..." (Pg.Z/12-13)"
>  The appellant also relied upon judgments in the case of Kiran Gupta & Ors.
> (2000) 7 SCC 719 (Para 22), Mrudul Dhar (Minor) vs. UOI, AIR 2005 SC 666 and
> a Division Bench judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh in the
> case of Ravinder Baloria, as mentioned in written submissions of the
> appellant placed at Pg.108, at Pg. 109 to 111.
 In view of the observations, it was urged that by allocating 50% of marks to
oral interview and additional 10% marks to AWT as compared to 25% marks to CAT
score which is written examination score, the merit is completely compromised.
A reference was also made to the table contained at Pg.61 (Part of SCA) to
demonstrate the effect of allocation of 50% marks to PI as compared to only
25% marks to CAT score on the result of the appellant. A candidate who secured
only 163.69 marks in CAT score is the last candidate who is selected and the
appellant is rejected. The selection process is therefore not in violation of
Art. 14 of the  Page 17 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT Constitution of India but is also in violation of
Sec. 7(e) and 8(3) of the Act.
 There is no distinction carved out in Ajay Hasia between admission to Under
Graduate Course and Post Graduate Course. The only classification is made
between admission to educational institutions and service recruitments. (Ref.
Kiran Gupta (2000) 7 SCC 719, Para 22 and also in Ravinder Baloria vs. State
of H.P, 2006 (1) ShimLC 259). The age of appellant was only 21 years when he
appeared for the interview.
 The appellant begs to place on record a chart referring to list of cases
where the issue of weightage on oral interview has been considered by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court at Annexure-I .
Observations and findings of the Hon'ble Single Judge  The Hon'ble Single
Judge is pleased to reject this contention by making observations as contained
in Para 13 @ Pg. Z/30, Para 16 and 17 @ Pg. Z/32 of the impugned judgment.
Other judgments which were placed are not even dealt with.
2A. Allocation of 6% marks towards co-curricular and extra-
> curricular activities is also arbitrary and unreasonable.
>  The prospectus does not provide allocation of any marks to co-curricular
> and extra-curricular activities  Page 18 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
> 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT (Pg.45 of the petition).
> However, it was disclosed through reply affidavit of the respondent @ Pg.64

>  In rejoinder, the appellant took serious objection to this allocation of

3\. Estoppel - No bar when challenge is based on violation of the Constitution
of India or the statute  A specific contention on behalf of the appellant in
this  Page 19 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT regard is made before the Hon'ble Single Judge in
written submissions (Pg.115). Five Judgments were cited. The Hon'ble Single
Judge however referred to only one judgment which is in the case of Dr.
(Major) Meeta Sahai (Pg.Z/5). However, this contention is rejected while
however referring to Para 22 of the judgment and not Para 18 of the judgment
(Pg.Z/33, Para 18). He contention that there cannot be an estoppel when the
challenge is made on the ground of arbitrariness under Art. 14 and on the
ground of violation of Sec. 7(e) and Sec. 8(3) of the Act is not considered.
4\. Selection Process- a policy decision  The Hon'ble Single Judge also
rejected the petition on the ground that admission process is a policy
decision (Para 19 & 20, Pg. Z/34 & 35).
 The Hon'ble Single Judge however did not consider that if admission process
is arbitrary and unreasonable, the same can be challenged even if it is
considered to be a policy decision. The impugned selection process is
violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution of India.

stood at 110 in the CAT merit list. There are about 200 general seats in IIM,
Ahmedabad. If the allocation of marks to the PI were given at 15% considering
judicial pronouncements, the appellant was bound to be in the select list. The
Hon'ble Single Judge by interim order dated 26.6.2020 was pleased to direct to
keep one seat vacant. The said interim order has been continued by this
Hon'ble Court. This Hon'ble Court may consider to allow the present appeal
considering the submissions. No prejudice will be caused to the IIM since one
seat is already kept vacant under the orders of this Hon'ble Court.

Page 21 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT Management - Ahmedabad ("IIMA"). The case of the Petitioner is that
the selection should be on the basis of written examination i.e. CAT Score and
that the weightage of only 25% to CAT Score in the final round of selection is
bad in law in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter
of Ajay Hansia reported in 1981 (1) SCC 722. Relying on the said Judgment the
Petitioner is contending that the weightage to interview score cannot be more
than 15% for final selection in any Educational Institute irrespective of the
nature of Education/Course offered to be imparted i.e. irrespective whether it
is Engineering, Medicine, Science, Arts, Humanities or Higher Education in
Management Studies. While in the instant case, where IIMA is engaged in
imparting Higher Education in the field of Management, for the final selection
the weightage of personal interview is 50% and weightage of CAT Score is only
25%.
DEFENCE / JUSTIFICATION BY IIMA:
2\. IIMA is an autonomous institute, imparting Higher Education in the field
of Management studies. Though with effect from 31.01.2018, IIMA is covered
under the Indian Institute of Management Act, 2017, IIMA continue to be
independent and autonomous body governed by the Board of Governors. The
overall superintendence, direction and control of the Institute including
powers to frame policies/ regulations lies with the Board of Governors and all
the IIMs have full autonomy to prescribe the courses of learning to be  Page
22 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT imparted including the criteria and procedure to be prescribed for
admission to each of the courses offered to the students. IIMA is offering
nine different courses.
Present Petition is with regard to 'Two Year Post Graduate Programme in
Management' (PGP). The course of PGP in Management as offered and imparted by
IIMA is a course having much more in-depth studies in the subject of Business
Management which includes studies of the following intra-subjects/topics
within the Business Management studies:
Organisational behaviour, Human Resource Management, Economics, Agri-business
Management, Public Policy, Strategy, Law, Educational Innovation and
Educational Psychology, Communication, Finance and Accounting, Information
Systems, Marketing, and Production and Quantitative Methods (including
operations research, operations management and statistics).
3\. Thus, it may be noted that in the instant case, it is with regard to
admission to higher studies in the field of Management, and is not with regard
to other courses like Engineering, Medicine, Science, Commerce, Arts or
Humanities.
Selection Process/ Criteria
4\. The selection process for the PGP Course in Management Studies is
consisting of two phases / two rounds: (1) Short  Page 23 of 75 Downloaded on
: Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT listing for
Analytical Writing Test (AWT) and Personal Interview (PI); and (2) Final
Selection.
For being selected for the second round (final selection round), i.e. short
listing for AWT and PI the weightage is as under:
(a) CAT Score 65%, (b) Past Academic 30% and (c) work experience 5%.
The criteria/parameters for final selection round is as under:
(a) Normalized PI Score 50%, (b) Normalized AWT Score 10%, (c) Normalized CAT
Score 25%, (d) Application Rating Score (Past Academic) 15%.
The entire selection process and the basis for arriving at the different
scores and the criteria/weightage has been explained in detail in the
prospectus which was uploaded on the website of IIMA and is also produced by
the Petitioner himself in the petition.
Nowhere in the prospectus, it has been mentioned that CAT Score will be the
sole criteria for the admission in IIMA. The prospectus mentions in detail the
different criteria and weightage of different parameters for both the rounds
and for different streams of past academics.
5\. It may be noted that the CAT Score plays an important role  Page 24 of 75
Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT for
being short listed for AWT and PI inasmuch as, the weightage of CAT Score is
65% for being short listed for final round, at that stage. Thereafter, in the
final round, along with other parameters, the weightage of CAT Score is 25%.
Rationale for Weightge of 50% for Personal Interview:
6\. (a) IIMA conducts personal interviews in order to select the best
candidates out of the pool of shortlisted candidates to its flagship
management program (PGP). Personal interviews are a critical component in
IIMA's admission process. Finding quality candidates to Management Program
involves interacting with the candidates on a wide range of topics such as
their academic background and clarity of concepts learnt in the undergraduate
degree, learnings from work experience, logical reasoning and ability to frame
coherent arguments, achievements and learning in co-curricular and extra-
curricular fields, awareness of national as well as international events, and
ability to communicate in English, among others. For the PGP Program, these
are essential characteristics of a management post-graduate who will in the
future become leader of an enterprise that can only be determined during a
personal meeting.
(b) Unlike undergraduate degrees where the candidates are enrolled in a
technical/engineering or commerce or arts/humanities degree; management post-
graduates are  Page 25 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT often required to understand business/management
problems from multiple perspectives drawing upon knowledge from various
domains. Also, management is about leading people which is often very
subjective, involves a lot of interpersonal dynamics, one needs good hold on
language (communication skills) as well as an impressive personality. These
are skills that are difficult to assess in a written examination. CAT is an
examination that is geared toward testing candidates on numerical ability,
data interpretation and reading/ comprehension ability. However, skills such
as general awareness, ability to present coherent arguments, communication
skills, etc. can only be assessed through a face-to-face meeting. Considering
these issues, IIMA believe that a personal interview plays an important role
in selection to a post- graduate management degree.
7\. It may be noted that the CAT Examination is of a Pattern having Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQ Pattern). The CAT Examination is geared towards testing
candidates on Numerical Ability (i.e. MATH), Data Interpretation (i..e. MATH)
and Reading / Comprehension Ability. While the Management Course requires
evaluation of a candidate in several different attributes such as learning
from academic discipline, learning from work experience, learning from other
domains, analytical abilities, socio cultural awareness, communication
abilities, leadership quality and overall development and personality of a
candidate. Such attributes cannot be evaluated through any written test.

JUDGMENT
The rationale for 50% weightage given to personal interview by IIMA has been
explained in detail at para 17 of the Reply of IIMA filed in SCA.
8\. All the top ranking IIMs and other top ranking Business Management Schools
in the Country, also give much more weightage to personal interview scores
than 15% as is sought to be capped by the Petitioner. A chart showing the
personal interview score weightage of various top ranking IIMs and other
Management Schools is produced at paragraph 16 of the Reply of IIMA (Running
page 63 of the Paperbook), which is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:

Thus, it will be appreciated that CAT Score alone is not a criteria for
admissions in IIMs. A combination of weightage of different attributes of a
candidate has always been recognized by IIMs and other top ranking management
schools.
Petitioner's Score and his Standing in Merit List:
9\. So far as the Petitioner is concerned, his scores for different attributes
and different parameters have been stated in paragraph 15 of the Reply of
IIMA. The charts produced at paragraph 15 (running pg. 61 and 62) also shows
the comparison between the Petitioner, the last select list candidate and the
last wait list candidate. It may be noted that there is not much difference
between the CAT Scores of the Petitioner and the last wait list candidate,
however, since the Normalized Final Composite Score of the Petitioner is
slightly less than the Normalized Final Composite Score of the last select
list candidate, unfortunately the Petitioner has missed out of being selected.
It may be noted that there are 64 number of candidates whose Final Composite
Score is more than the Petitioner i.e. there are 64 candidates between the
last selected candidate the Petitioner. Further, for the batch of 2020-2022,
out of the short listed candidates for the Second Phase/Second Round of
selection at IIMA, there are 37 number of  Page 28 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri
Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT candidates who have
scored more than 206.86 in CAT, which is the score of the Petitioner, but are
also NOT figuring in the select list or the wait list because their Final
Composite Score is less than the last of the wait listed candidate.
Thus, it may be appreciated that CAT Score is not the sole criteria for
securing admission in IIMA.
Petitioner is estopped from challenging selection process/criteria after
participating in it without grievance, after coming to know that he is not
successful.
10\. The selection criteria/weightage and the selection process has been
explained in detail in the prospectus/website of IIMA. The Petitioner, right
from the beginning was well aware of the selection process and the selection
criteria as explained in detail in the prospectus/website. The Petitioner
himself has annexed at Annexure-H, Page 39 to the Petition, the prospectus and
particularly the admission/selection process. It will be worthwhile to point
out at this juncture that, it has been clearly mentioned in the prospectus of
IIMA, amongst other things as under:
> "The following information is about the admission process followed by IIMA
> for its PGP subsequent to CAT. It is therefore, important for the candidates
> to read them carefully.

JUDGMENT
1 Performance in CAT is an important input in the admission process.
Candidates should note that it is important to perform well in each section of
the test. In addition to the performance in CAT, IIMA uses academic
performance of the candidates throughout their academic career up to the
bachelor's level for shortlisting for AWT & PI.
2 .....
3 .....
4 After the AWT & PI round, admission offers are made by IIMA to successful
candidates. The final selection is based on a diverse set of attributes which
includes performance in CAT, performance in AWT & PI, academic, co-curricular
and extra-curricular achievements, work experience etc.....
5 .....
6 ....."
(emphasis supplied) Thus, the Petitioner was always aware that, the CAT score
was to be considered for the purpose of shortlisting for AWT and PI round.
While the final selection is to be based on diverse set of attributes which
includes performance in CAT, performance in AWT and PI, academic co-curricular
and extra-curricular achievements, work experience etc. The Prospectus clearly
mentions that for shortlisting for the final  Page 30 of 75 Downloaded on :
Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT round the weightage
of CAT Score is 65%, past academics is 30% and work experience is 5%. The
prospectus also mentions that for final selection the weightage of CAT score
is 25%, personal interview is 50%, AWT is 10% and Application Ratings is 15%.
The Petitioner was thus, also aware that for final selection, the weightage of
CAT score is 25% while the weightage of Personal Interview is 50% and that of
AWT is 10%. The Petitioner with complete knowledge of the said aspect applied
for being selected at IIMA and has participated in the admission/selection
process.
In this context, the following dates may kindly be noted:
     Dates               Events
     July, 2010          Prospectus uploaded on website of
                         IIMA.
     18.09.2019          Last date for submission of Forms for
                         CAT Examination.
     November, 2019      CAT Examination held.
     04.01.2020          CAT Results declared.
     06.01.2020          Petitioner short listed for Second/Final
                         Round (i.e. short listed for AWT and
                         PI).
     12.01.2020          Interview of Petitioner held.
     11.05.2020          Petitioner informed by regret letter that
                         he is not selected or wait-listed.
     22.06.2020          Petition filed by Petitioner.
The Petitioner, therefore, after being unsuccessful in getting selected, is
now, as an afterthought, trying to contend that the selection process and the
criteria was not made known  Page 31 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23
IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT in advance by IIMA. The said contention,
on the face of it, is absolutely false and frivolous and is made by the
Petitioner only to suit his purpose. The prospectus uploaded on the website,
has been produced by the Petitioner himself at Annexure-H, Page 39 to the
Petition. The Petitioner has clearly tried to mislead this Hon'ble Court. It
is well settled that, when the selection process and the selection criteria is
made known to the public at large including the participating candidates
before the selection, then the candidates are not entitled to challenge the
selection process and the selection criteria, after having participated in and
not being successful in getting selected. This principle of law is well
settled by a catena of decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court including the
decisions reported in (a) 1995(3)SCC 486 [Madanlal Vs State of J & K]; (b)
1998 (3) SCC 694; (c) 2008(4)SCC 486 [Dhananjay Malik Vs State of
Uttaranchal]; and (d) 2010(12) SCC 576 [Manish Kumar Shahi Vs State of Bihar].
The Petition, therefore, fails on this ground alone.
11\. The reliance placed by the Petitioner on the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Dr. (Major) Meeta Sahai vs. State of Bihar & Ors.
reported in 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1632, is also ill founded and not applicable in
the facts and circumstances of the present case. It is submitted that in the
said matter of Dr. (Major) Meeta Sahai, it was a case of mis-interpretation
and misconstruction of statutory rules concerning selection by the Institute
concerned and consequent discrimination arising from such misconstruction of
statutory rules. It was in such  Page 32 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT circumstances that the Hon'ble
Court has observed and permitted a candidate to challenge the selection, after
participating in the selection process. In the instant case that is not the
issue involved. There is no statutory rule or a provision of Statute which is
being misinterpreted or misconstrued by IIMA. On the contrary IIMA has
scrupulously followed the process as documented in the prospectus.
Decision of Ajay Hasia reported in 1981(1) SCC 722 relied upon by the
Petitioner is not applicable:
12\. It is respectfully submitted that there is no provision of any Statue
including IIM Act or any other Statutory Rule which prescribe of not giving
50% weightage to Personal Interview for being selected for a course of higher
education i.e. post graduate studies in the field of Business Management. The
reliance placed by the Petitioner on the decision of Ajay Hasia reported in
1981 (1) SCC 722 is also misplaced in the present matter. In the case of Ajay
Hasia, the issue was with regard to admission to the course of the Basic
Degree of Engineering after 12th grade. The students to be admitted to the
college of engineering were the boys of 16-17 years of age who were not
experienced with other attributes and their personality was yet to be
developed. Moreover, the admissions were for engineering courses and not for
higher education in the field of Business Management where many attributes to
the personality of a candidate are relevant. It is the overall development of
a candidate which is required to  Page 33 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT be ascertained, for admission in
the course of higher studies in Management field. Therefore, the reliance
placed on the said Judgment by the Petitioner is ill-founded.
The dicta in the case of Ajay Hansia has been much water down by the
subsequent Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court also in the matter of
appointment for job in Services Law. In the matter of Kiran Gupta V/s. State
of UP, reported in 2000 (7) SCC 719, the Supreme Court has observed as under:
> "22. It is difficult to accept the omnibus contention that selection on the
> basis of viva voce only is arbitrary and illegal and that since allocation
> of 15% marks for interview was held to be arbitrary by this Court, selection
> solely based on interview is a fortiori illegal. It will be useful to bear
> in mind that there is no rule of thumb with regard to allotment of
> percentage of marks for interview. It depends on several factors and the
> question of permissible percentage of marks for an interview-test has to be
> decided on the facts of each case. ........."
Even in the matter of Lila Dhar V/s. State of Rajsthan reported in 1981 (4)
SCC 159, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 5 of the said Judgment has observed
as under:
> "... ...... .....
> It is now well recognised that while a written  Page 34 of 75 Downloaded on

Generally Courts not to interfere in Educational Policy Matters or issue
involving academic matter:
13\. Without undermining the wide powers and jurisdiction exercised by this
Hon'ble Court, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, it is
respectfully submitted that generally, in a question of educational policy or
an issue involving academic matter, the Courts keep their hands off. Only if
any provision of law or rules has to be interpreted or applied with reference
to or connected with education that the Courts may step in. It is respectfully
submitted that, what should be norms and standards in regard to entry
qualification, weightage to be given to different parameters/ attributes for
admission, content of course, inspections/ manner of assessing the
performance, are all decisions in  Page 35 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT academic matters of technical
nature. It is most humbly and respectfully submitted that, the Courts may not
be equipped nor may have the academic or technical background to substitute
themselves in place of professionals and academicians and take the decision in
academic matters involving standard and quality of higher education. In a
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 2009 (11) SCC 726, it has
been observed as under:
> "16. The courts are neither equipped nor have academic or technical

14\. Thus, the following aspects emerges in the instant case:
(i) The entire selection process has been well documented in advance and
uploaded on the website and is  Page 37 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT transparent, fair and designed
to select the most meritorious candidates;
(ii) The selection procedure and criteria is framed and designed by the expert
academicians of IIMA;
(iii) The Petitioner was well aware of the selection criteria and weightage of
different of tests/parameters as well as the weightage of personal interview
visa-a-vis weightage of CAT Score;
(iv) Petitioner participated in the selection process as well as participated
in the AWT and PI round without any grievance;
(v) Having not fared well in the interview, Petitioner challenges the
selection criteria on being not selected in the final round at a very belated
stage (Petitioner is estopped from challenging the criteria after having
participated in the selection process without any grievance);
(vi) There are no allegations of mala-fide or prejudice against any of the
Member of the Interviewing Penal who had interviewed the Petitioner;
(vii) The interviews are conducted by experts in the field and lasts on an
average about 20-30 mins. The interview scores are rescaled to remove any bias
that may exist in the interview scores;

JUDGMENT
(vii) Almost all top ranking IIMs and other top ranking Business Management
Schools also give much more weightage to person interview and Analytical
Writing Test (Essay Writing);
(viii) There is no statute or a statutory regulation prohibiting any
management school from having weightage of more than 15% to personal interview
score for the purpose of selection for admission in the course of Higher
Studies in Management field.
15\. Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that the admission/selection
procedure and criteria framed and designed by the expert academicians of IIMA
to assess and ascertain the most meritorious candidate from out of the
shortlisted brilliant candidates may not be interfered with by this Hon'ble
Court and that too on a Petition of a candidate who has not been successful in
selection, after participating in the selection process, knowing fully well
the selection process and the criteria including the weightage given to AWT &
PI and the weightage of CAT score. It is only because the Petitioner has not
been able to score well in AWT and PI after scoring well in CAT examination,
that he wants weightage of all other attributes/ parameters to be nullified
and weightage of CAT score be increased so that he is able to secure an
admission. This would, in the respectful submission of IIMA create a bad
precedence, encouraging all other candidates to challenge the selection
criteria after participating in the selection process, on not being selected.

JUDGMENT
16\. The Ld. Single Judge has rightly appreciated the above aspects and the
position of law and has rightly dismissed the Petition by a well reasoned
Judgment and Order dated 28.07.2020. Therefore, the present Appeal is required
to be dismissed in limine.
ANALYSIS :
12\. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having
gone through the materials on record, the only question that falls for our
consideration is, whether the learned Single Judge committed any error in
passing the impugned judgment and order.
13\. As pointed out by Mr.Navin Pahwa, the learned senior counsel appearing
for the appellant, the selection process of the respondent is in two parts :
In the first part, the respondent allocates 35 marks to the score for the
previous academic career, i.e. from Class-X to Graduation and 65% marks are
allocated to the score of the CAT. The second part and the final selection
process contained the following allocation :
    1.     Personal Interview (PI)                              50%
    2.     Analytical Written Test (AWT)                        10%
    3.     Common Admission Test (CAT)                          25%
    4.     Previous Academic Career                             15%
                                              TOTAL :          100%

           C/LPA/388/2020                                   CAV JUDGMENT
14\. We need to consider the principal argument of Mr.Pahwa that the
allocation of 50% marks towards the Personal Interview as compared to only 25%
marks to the CAT score is ex-facie arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of
the Constitution of India.
15\. One of the first cases where the question regarding the validity of
interview/viva voce as a mode of assessing the merit of a candidate arose is
R.Chitralekha v. State of Mysore and others, [1964]6 SCR 368. This case
related to admission to the Medical and Engineering Colleges. The contention
raised was that the system of selection by interviews is illegal inasmuch as
it enables the interviewers to act arbitrarily and to manipulate the results
and, therefore, it contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution. The Supreme
Court noted that the highly qualified educationists were appointed to the
Selection Committees and guidelines had been issued to the Selection
Committees to allot marks in interview keeping in view the general knowledge,
aptitude and personality, previous academic career including the special
distinction and the N.C.C., A.C.C., etc. of the candidates. Taking into
consideration all these factors the Court observed as follows:
> "It is, therefore, clear that the Government by its order not only laid down
> a clear policy and prescribed definite criteria in the matter of giving
> marks at the interview but also appointed competent men to make the
> selection on that basis. The order of the Government does not in any way
> contravene Article 14 of the Constitution."
16\. The court further held as under:
Page 41 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
> "We cannot, therefore, hold without better and more scientific material
> placed before us that selection by interview in addition to the marks
> obtained in the written examination is itself bad as offending Article 14 of
> the Constitution."
17\. A similar question came up for consideration in Minor A Peeraikaruppan v.
State of Tamil Nadu and others, [1971]2 SCR
430\. In this case the Supreme Court was dealing with a case relating to
admissions to the Medical Colleges where 75 marks out of 275 marks had been
earmarked for the interview. The Supreme Court dealing with the contention
that the marks allotted to the interview were excessive held as follows:
> "13. Earmarking 75 marks out of 275 marks for interview as interview marks
> prima facie appears to be excessive. It is not denied that the interview
> lasted hardly for three minutes for each candidate. In the course of three
> minutes interview it is hardly possible to assess the capability of a
> candidate. In most cases the first impression need not necessarily be the
> best impression....
> 14\. Even when the interviews are conducted by impartial and competent
> persons on scientific lines very many uncertain factors like the initial
> nervousness on the part of some candidates, the mood in which the
> interviewer happens to be and the odd questions that may be put to the
> persons interviewed may all go to affect the result of the interview....

JUDGMENT
> 17\. We may note that the committee had not divided the interview marks

18\. In Dr. J.P.Kulshrestha and others v. Chancellor, Allahabad University and
others, (1980)II LLJ 175 SC, the Supreme Court was dealing with a case
relating to the selection of Readers by the Allahabad University. In this case
while dealing with the question whether the method of interview is a proper
method for selecting persons for the post of Readers, the court observed as
follows:
> "10. Certainly, cases arise where the art of interviewing candidates
> deteriorates from strategy to stratagem and undetectable manipulation of
> results is achieved by remote control tactics masked as viva voce tests.
> This, if allowed, is surely a sabotage of the purity of proceedings, a

> that courts insist, as the learned Single Judge has, in this very case,
> suggested on recording of marks at interviews and other fair checks like

> is skeptical, the record of the selection proceedings, including the notes
> regarding the interviews, may have to be made available. Interviews, as
> such, are not bad but polluting it to attain illegitimate ends is bad...."

JUDGMENT
19\. In this regard, a constitutional bench judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib, reported in (1981)1 SCC 722, has been
significantly relied upon. We must understand the principles of law
discernible from this judgment, more particularly, the ratio.
20\. In Ajay Hasia (supra), the validity of the admissions made to the
Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, in the academic year 1979-80 was
brought in question. The College was sponsored by the Government of India. It
was established and its administration and management were carried on by a
society registered under the Jammu and Kashmir Registration of Societies Act,
1898. The Society had framed certain rules regulating its administration. Rule
15(iv) conferred power on the Board of Governors to make by-laws for admission
of students to various courses. Pursuant to Rule 15(iv), the Board of
Governors laid down the procedure for admission to students to different
courses.
21\. Separate marks were assigned under four different heads for the viva voce
examination. The petitioners in that case challenged the validity of the
admissions on the ground that the Society acted arbitrarily in the matter of
granting of admissions; first, by ignoring the marks obtained by the
candidates at the qualifying examination; secondly, by relying on the viva
voce examination as a test for determining comparative merit of the
candidates; thirdly by allocating as many as 50 marks for the viva voce
examination as against 100 marks allocated for the written test and lastly, by
holding superficial interviews lasting  Page 44 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct
02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT only 2 or 3 minutes on an
average and asking questions which had no relevance to the assessment of the
suitability of the candidates with reference to the four factors required to
be considered at the viva voce examination. The first ground of challenge was
rejected. On the second ground of challenge, the holding was that it could not
be said that the oral interview test is so defective that selecting candidates
for admission on the basis of oral interview in addition to written test must
be regarded as arbitrary. However, the following further observations were
made while dealing with the said challenge:
> "The oral interview test is undoubtedly not a very satisfactory test for
> assessing and evaluating the capacity and calibre of candidates, but in the
> absence of any better test for measuring personal characteristics and
> traits, the oral interview test must, at the present stage, be regarded as
> not irrational or irrelevant though it is subjective and based on first
> impression. Its result is influenced by many uncertain factors and it is
> capable of abuse. We would, however, like to point out that in the matter of
> admission of Colleges or even in the matter of public employment the oral
> interview test as presently held should not be relied upon as an exclusive
> test, but it may be resorted to only as an additional or supplementary test
> and, moreover, great care must be taken to see that persons who are
> appointed to conduct the oral interview test are men of high integrity,
> calibre and qualification."
22\. As regards the third ground of challenge, it was held that the allocation
of 50 marks out of 150 marks for the viva voce test  Page 45 of 75 Downloaded
on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT was arbitrary
and unreasonable inasmuch as it came to 331/3% of the total number of marks
taken into account for the purpose of making the selection and it was observed
as follows:
> "....having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview
> test and the conditions prevailing in the country, particularly when there
> is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much
> on the increase, allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral
> interview as compared to the marks allocated for the written test, cannot be
> accepted by the Court as free from the vice of arbitrariness....There can be
> no doubt that allocating 33 1/3 of the total marks for oral interview is
> plainly arbitrary and unreasonable.... and selection of candidates made on
> the basis of such admission procedure cannot be sustained.... We are of the
> view that, under the existing circumstances, allocation of more than 15% of
> the total marks for the oral interview would be arbitrary and unreasonable
> and would be liable to be struck down as constitutionally invalid."
23\. On the facts of the case, it was pointed out that it was a rather
disturbing feature that a large number of successful candidates succeeded in
obtaining admission to the college by virtue of very high marks obtained by
them at the viva voce examination, which tilted the balance in their favour,
though the marks secured by them at the qualifying examination were much less
than those obtained by the petitioners and even in the written test, they had
fared much worse than the petitioners. As regards the last ground of
challenge, the holding was that if the  Page 46 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct
02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT interview did not take more
than 2 or 3 minutes on an average and the questions asked had no bearing on
the factors required to be taken into account, the oral interview test would
be vitiated, because it would be impossible in such an interview to assess the
merit of a candidate with reference to these factors. On the facts of the
case, it was found that the interview of each candidate did not last for more
than two or three minutes on an average and hardly any questions were asked
having bearing on the relevant factors. The selections made on the basis of
such oral interview test were held to be vitiated as arbitrary. As regards the
grant of relief, however, the Supreme Court was of the view that although the
selections were vitiated on the two grounds mentioned above, no relief could
be granted in the exercise of discretion of the court since it would cause
immense hardship to those students in whose case the validity of the selection
could not otherwise be questioned and who had nearly completed three semesters
and it would not be possible to restore the petitioners to the position as if
they were admitted for the academic year 1979-80 which had long since run out.
Besides, in that case, the respondents had agreed before the court that the
best fifty students out of those who had failed to secure admission would be
granted admission for the academic year 1981-82 and that the seats allocated
to them would be in addition to the normal intake of students in the college
and an order was made accordingly. Having regard to all these factors, the
writ petitions were dismissed but the Supreme Court cautioned the authorities
that for the future academic years, selections should be made on the basis of
the observations made in the judgment lest they might run the risk of being
struck down.

JUDGMENT
24\. In Arti Sapru and others v. State of J&K and others, [1981]3 SCR 34, the
Supreme Court held that in view of the judgment in Ajay Hasia's case (supra),
the allocation of more than 15% marks for interview in case of admission to
the Medical Colleges would be arbitrary and unreasonable. However, it did not
interfere in the case and asked the State to revise the marks ratio.
25\. In Koshal Kumar Gupta and others v. State of J & K and others, [1984]3
SCR 407, the Supreme Court held that for the purpose of interview for
admission to the Engineering College the allocation of 15 marks in the
interview was valid especially since the method of interview was virtually
foolproof. The Supreme Court held as follows:
> "...15 marks assigned for viva-voce test were further split-up under four
> heads, namely, (i) Science-5 marks, (ii) General Knowledge-4 marks (iii)
> curricular activities-3 marks (iv) Personality test-3 marks. In respect of
> the first three heads the Selection Committee prepared cards on each of
> which a question was typed referable to the 4 subjects, namely, Physics,
> Chemistry, Mathematics and General Knowledge and they were kept in 4
> different boxes. When the candidate entered the room for interview, he was
> required to pick-up at random one card from each of the four boxes, each box
> containing at least 150 cards and answer the question. A tape recorder was
> kept on the table in front of the members of the Selection Committee and the
> candidate appearing, for  Page 48 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23
> IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT the interview and the two-way dialogue
> was recorded in full. Marks were assigned under each head of viva-voce test
> depending upon the merit of the answer. Thereafter, the merit list was
> prepared on the basis of the total marks obtained at written test and the
> viva-voce test and it was strictly adhered to save and except for reserved
> seats where also persons seeking admission to reserved seats had to stand in
> queue as in the merit list. The method and the number of marks assigned for
> the viva-voce test was challenged on the ground that reservation of 15 marks
> for viva-voce test conferred arbitrary, unguided and uncanalised power on
> those conducting the viva voce test and that reservation of 15 marks for
> viva-voce test would have the pernicious tendency of affecting the merit
> disclosed by the marks obtained at written examination. Not a single case
> was pointed out in which the candidate otherwise being eligible for
> admission on merit, lost the same because of inability to get some marks
> under the personality test, the maximum being 3 only."
26\. In Javid Rasool Bhat and others v. State of Jammu and Kashmir and others,
[1984]2 SCR 582, the Supreme Court held that the allotment of 15 marks for the
interview out of which 8 marks were for the aptitude and 7 marks for the
general knowledge and the general information were just and reasonable
especially when the Selection Committee consisted of the Chairman of the Jammu
& Kashmir Public Service Commission and two members, namely, the Principals of
the two Government Medical Colleges of Srinagar and Jammu.

27\. In Lila Dhar v. State of Rajasthan and Ors., (1981) 4 SCC 159, a three-
Judge Bench rejected the Petitioner's challenge to the recruitment to
Rajasthan Judicial Service on the ground prescribed for interview (25%) were
highly excessive and observed:

courts to pronounce upon it unless exaggerated weight has been given with
proven or obvious oblique motives. that the marks The Kothari Committee also
suggested that in view of the obvious importance of the subject, it may be
examined in detail by the Research Unit of the Union Public Service
Commission.
In this background, let us now examine the situation presented by the
Rajasthan Rules. The Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules have been made by the
Governor of Rajasthan in consultation with the High Court of Rajasthan and the
Rajasthan Public Service Commission. The High Court may be expected to know
the precise requirements of the judicial service of the State and the calibre
of the available source- material, while the Public Service Commission is an
expert  Page 51 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT body thoroughly conversant with recruitment
policies and selection methods. Both the High Court and the Public Service
Commission are independent bodies, outside executive control, occupying
special positions and enjoying special status under the Constitution. Neither
is an outside agency. Both are well-acquainted with the particular needs of
their State and the people. If the Governor, in consultation with the High
Court and the Public Service Commission of the State makes rules stipulating
seventy-five per cent of the marks for the written examination and twenty-five
per cent for the interview-test, on what basis can a court say that twenty-
five per cent for the interview-test is on the high side? It must not also be
forgotten that the interview test is generally conducted and was, in the
present case, conducted by a body consisting of a Judge of the High Court, the
Chairman and a Member of the Public Service Commission and a special invitee
expert. There can surely be no legitimate grievance or hint of arbitrariness
against this body. Yet another factor worthy of consideration is that the
candidates expected to offer themselves for selection are not raw graduates
freshly out of college but are persons who have already received a certain
amount of professional training. The source-material is such that some
weightage must be given to the interview-test and can it possibly be said that
twenty-five per cent of the total marks is an exaggerated weightage. We may
add here that it has been made clear by the Chairman, Rajasthan Public Service
Commission on whose behalf a counter- affidavit has been filed before us that
the marks obtained by the candidates at the written examination were not made
available to the  Page 52 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT members of the Interview Board either before or at
the time of the interview. We are unhesitatingly of the view that the
selection cannot be struck down on the ground that more than due weightage was
given to the interview-test."
28\. In State of U.P. v. Rafiquddin and Ors., 1987 Supp SCC 401, the court
referred to the ratio of the Judgment in Lila Dhar v. State of Rajasthan and
Ors. (supra), refused to nullify the selection made for recruitment to the
U.P. Civil Service (Judicial Branch) and observed:
> "In A.K. Yadav v. State of Haryana a Constitution Bench of this Court
> approved the view expressed in Lila Dhar case. The Court observed there
> cannot be any hard and fast rule regarding the weight to be given as against
> the written examination. It must vary from service to service; according to
> the requirement of the service, the minimum qualification, prescribed age
> group from which the selection is to be made, the body to which the task of

> factors. It is a matter for determination by experts. The court does not
> possess the necessary equipment and it would not be right for the court to

29\. In Mehmood Alam Tariq and others v. State of Rajasthan and Ors., (1988) 3
SCC 241, the court distinguished the earlier Judgments in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid
Mujib Sehravardi, (1981)1 SCC 722, Ashok Kumar Yadav v. State of Haryana,
(1985) 4 SCC 417, relied upon Lila Dhar v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. (supra)
and held that prescription of 33% marks for interview for recruitment to the
Rajasthan State and Services (Direct Recruitment by Combined Competitive
Examinations) Rules, 1962, Rajasthan Service Rules, 1954, Rajasthan Police
Service Rules, 1954, Rajasthan Forest Service Rules, Rajasthan Forest
Subordinate Service Rules, 1963 is not violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution. Some of the observations made in that Judgment are extracted
below:
> "On a careful consideration of the matter, we are persuaded to the view that
> the prescription of minimum qualifying marks of 60 (33 per cent) out of the
> maximum marks of 180 set apart for the viva voce examination does not, by
> itself,  Page 54 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
> C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT incur any constitutional infirmity. The
> principles laid down in the cases of Ajay Hasia, Lila Dhar, Ashok Kumar
> Yadav, do not militate against or render impermissible such a prescription.

02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT detail the question as to how
many marks should be allotted for the interviews. In this case, the court was
concerned with selections made by the Haryana Public Service Commission to the
cadre of Haryana Civil and Allied Services. It was held that the allocation of
22.2% marks for the viva voce test in the case of Haryana Civil Services
(Executive Branch) and other Allied Services were unreasonable. The court
directed as follows:
> "29. We would therefore direct that hereafter in case of selections to be
> made to the Haryana Civil Services (Executive Branch) and other Allied
> Services, where the competitive examination consists of a written
> examination followed by a viva voce test, the marks allocated for the viva

215 SC, where the Supreme Court was considering the case of promotions to the
post of Deputy Operations Manager and in Madan Lal and others v. State of J&K
and others, [1995]1 SCR 908, where the selections to the post of Munsifs in
the State of Jammu and Kashmir were being made and the court upheld the viva
voce examination in addition to the written test.
36\. In D.V. Bakshi and others v. Union of India and others, 1993 ECR 209
(SC), the Supreme Court was dealing with a case where the examination was for
grant of licence to the Customs House Agents. The Supreme Court held that in
such circumstances the allocation of 50% marks was justified where the nature
of the job was such that it required a well developed personality. The court
held that the test which is valid for the competitive examination or admission
to the educational institutions may not be relevant in that case. With regard
to the method of conducting the interview the court held as follows:
> "7. If an oral test is, therefore, a 'must' as in this case, a heavy
> responsibility is cast on the examiners to maintain a proper record of the
> oral test in respect of each candidate and marks must preferably be assigned
> under each head considered relevant to evaluate the candidate. That is why
> we have said that a heavy responsibility lies on those examining the
> candidates at the interview to ensure that proper record is maintained so
> that there is no room for suspicion in the minds of the unsuccessful
> candidates that  Page 58 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
> C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT the result of the oral test is tainted with bias
> for or against any candidate because even light proof in support of the
> charge may upset the result of the oral test as a whole or qua a candidate,
> as the case may be."
37\. In Jasvinder Singh and others v. State of J&K and others, (2003)2 SCC
132, the Court was concerned with a case relating to the selection to the post
of the Sub Inspector of Police and upheld the allocation of 20% marks for the
interview.
38\. The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered in Mridul Dhar (minor) and
another v. Union of India and others, AIR 2005 SC 666, was dealing with the
whole gamut of questions relating to the admissions to the Medical Colleges.
The directions of the court are contained in para 35. Direction No.13, which
is relevant for the purpose of the decision of the present case, reads as
follows:
> "13. For granting admission, the merit determined by competitive examination
> shall not be tinkered with by making a provision like grant of marks by mode
> of interview or any other mode."
39\. From a perusal of the various judgments cited above, it is clear that
right from the very beginning the law has been that for admission to the
educational courses where interviews are conducted, the weightage of marks
given for the interview should be as low as possible. The law also is that the
persons of very high integrity who are impartial and known to be competent in
Page 59 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT their fields should be made the members of the Selection Committee. A
clear and unambiguous guidelines should be given to them. The interview marks
should be awarded under the various heads to make the procedure more objective
and transparent. The court has held that where young children of
impressionable mind, whose personality has still to develop are to be tested,
then the admission should be, as far as possible, on the basis of the
performance in the written test. The importance attached to the interview
should be as less as possible.
40\. The Supreme Court has also drawn a clear-cut distinction between the
weightage of marks to be given for the interviews when admission to the
educational courses is to be made and the weightage when the interviews are
conducted for recruitment to services. In the latter case, the nature of the
service shall also be very relevant. This would also be a relevant factor to
determine what should be the weightage of marks to be given for the interview.
In case the interview is of persons who are of the matured age and the
requirement of the job is that person's personality is well developed, then
obviously higher marks can be kept for the interview. There can be no hard and
fast rule in this regard.
41\. From the judgments noticed above, it is clear that in cases relating to
the admission to the Medical and Engineering Colleges, initially it was held
that the marks for the interview should not exceed 15% of the total marks.
However, in Mridul Dhar (minor) (supra), the Supreme Court has held that the
marks obtained in the written test should not be tinkered by  Page 60 of 75
Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT
making a provision for marks by way of interview or any other mode. Therefore,
the Supreme Court has moved from granting 15% marks to nil marks for the
interview.
42\. With everything that has been stated above, more particularly, the
various decisions of the Supreme Court referred to above, could it be said
that such decisions has laid down a straitjacket formula for determining,
whether the prescription of particular percentage of marks for the viva voce
test/interview introduces an element of arbitrariness in the process of
selection or gives unbridled power to the recruiting authority/agency to
select less meritorious candidates ? Should a writ court, in exercise of its
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
raise its eyebrows on the mere look at the figure of 50 ? Or, should a writ
court try to look into and understand the rationale behind such policy of
allocating 50% marks for the viva voce test ?
43\. In the aforesaid context, we must try to understand the rationale behind
the policy of the IIM to allocate 50% marks for the personal interview. The
rationale has been explained in the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent
in the main matter, in paragraphs 14 and 17 respectively, which read thus :
> "14. Thereafter he had appeared for Analytical Writing Test (AWT) and
> Personal Interview (PI). He has scored 7 out of 10 in AWT and has scored 8.5
> out of 44 in PI. In respect to co-
curricular and extra-curricular attributes he has scored 1 out of 6. At this
juncture, it may be pointed out that so far as the  Page 61 of 75 Downloaded
on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT Personal
Interview is concerned, such interviews last for about 20 to 30 minutes and
sometimes even 40 minutes for each candidate. There are two professors in the
panel for interview for each candidate. The process adopted at IIMA is such
that, the interviewers do not know the CAT score or AWT score or AR score of
the candidate being interviewed. Both the panelists give their independent
marks with regard to different attributes of a candidate in the PI test, and
thereafter the average of both the panelist is taken into consideration for
each candidate. So far as the Petitioner is concerned, in his case, panelist-1
has given score of 7/44 and panelist-2 has given score of 10/44 and thus the
average score of the Petitioner came to 8.5/44. It is submitted that, the PI
test is aimed at finding out the expertise of the candidate in respect to
different attributes such as : (i) Learning from Academic Discipline, (ii)
Learning from Work Experience, (iii) Learning from other Domains, (iv)
Analytical Abilities, (v) Socio-Cultural Awareness, (vi) Communication
Abilities, (vii) Leadership quality, (viii) Overall Suitability, etc. It is
submitted that, such attributes of a candidate can be ascertained only through
personal interviews and cannot be ascertained through any written test, and
particularly not through CAT examination. It may be noted that, the CAT
examination is following the MCQ pattern i.e. multiple-choice question.
Therefore, it is extremely difficult to judge the aforesaid attributes of a
candidate from the CAT scores and hence CAT score alone cannot form basis for
final selection of a candidate.

JUDGMENT
17\. It will be appreciated that, CAT score cannot be made the sole criteria
for securing admission for higher studies like PGP in Management at IIMA,
which ranks higher compared to degree of MBA offered by other Universities and
Colleges. The rationale for weightage to Personal Interview is as under :
A. IIMA conducts personal interviews in order to select the best candidates
out of the pool of shortlisted candidates to its flagship management program
(PGP). Personal interviews are a critical component in IIMA's admission
process. Finding quality candidates to Management program involves interacting
with the candidates on a wide range of topics such as their academic
background and clarity of concepts learnt in the undergraduate degree,
learnings from work experience, logical reasoning and ability to frame
coherent arguments, achievements and learning in co- curricular and extra-
curricular fields, awareness of national as well as international events, and
ability to communicate in English, among others. For the PGP Program, these
are essential characteristics of a management post-graduate who will in the
future become leader of an enterprise that can only be determined during a
personal meeting.
B. Unlike undergraduate degrees where the candidates are enrolled in a
technical/engineering or commerce or arts/ humanities degree; management post-
graduates are often required to understand business/management problems from
multiple perspectives drawing upon knowledge from various domains. Also,
management is about leading people  Page 63 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02
03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT which is often very subjective,
involves a lot of interpersonal dynamics, one needs good hold on language
(communication skills) as well as an impressive personality. These are skills
that are difficult to assess in a written examination. CAT is an examination
that is geared toward testing candidates on numerical ability, data
interpretation and reading/ comprehension ability. However, skills such as
general awareness, ability to present coherent arguments, communication
skills, etc. can only be assessed through a face-to-face meeting. Considering
these issues, IIMA believe that a personal interview plays an important role
in selection to a post-graduate management degree.
C. To given an example, questions on analytical thinking during the personal
interview are devised to see how the candidate can analyse a situation and
create a solution. For example, an interviewer may ask a candidate to explain
a time when the candidate had to work quickly against a pending deadline. In
the personal interview, the interviewer may ask follow-up questions to dig
deeper into the candidate's analytical thinking process, to see if he/she fits
the profile for a successful management graduate.
D. Another example could be, when an interviewer is engaged in a personal
interview with a candidate, he/she will listen to hear how the candidate gives
answers to questions, watch for body language that can indicate the candidate
is not being truthful or is uncomfortable; determine confidence by gauging eye
contact. In positions of management (such as a leader, manager), being able to
Page 64 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT effectively communicate using his/her entire body is important, and
these skills can only be assessed during a personal interview."
44\. Thus, the respondent has tried in its own way to explain the rationale
behind its policy to allocate 50% marks for the personal interview. If we have
to put the policy or the rationale in few words, we may only say that while
the written examination will testify the candidate's academic knowledge, the
oral test alone can bring out or disclose his overall intellectual and
personal qualities like alertness, resourcefulness, dependableness,
cooperativeness, capacity for clear and logical presentation, effectiveness in
discussion, effectiveness in meeting and dealing with others, adaptability,
judgment, ability to make decision, quality of leadership, etc.
45\. As the fate of a candidate desirous of securing admission in the IIM is
more dependent on his performance in the viva voce test, the principle-
oriented approach would in the end-result convince one that norms or
guidelines are very much essential from the following stand-points :
> (1) The criteria are well defined and well known to all the members of the
> Selection Committee so that all of them measure with the same yardstick and
> not with different weights and measures.
> (2) The same criteria is applied in the case of all candidates so that all
> are selected or discarded by the same standards.
Page 65 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
> (3) The same criteria is uniformly applied from year to year unless a
> deliberate modification is made in light of new developments and/or past
> experience.
> (4) The criteria are capable of being ascertained if occasion so demands.
> (5) The members of Selection Committee are rendered immune from the external
> pulls and pressures as also from the inner subconscious pulls, pressures and
> predilections.
> (6) The selectors inform themselves and there is a guarantee that only the
> relevant factors enter into the decision and all irrelevant factors are
> excluded.
> (7) The same extent of weightage within known parameters is accorded to
> every individual criterion uniformly inter se amongst the contestants from
> year to year.
46\. In a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the court
does not sit in appeal over a decision of the Selection Committee. However,
the selection procedure adopted by the Committee is open to judicial scrutiny.
If it is found that the mode and method of selection was arbitrary,
irrational, unreasonable, irrelevant, bias or vitiated by malafides or
contrary to the rules and regulations, the court would have the power, indeed
duty, to quash the selection because of the mandate of Articles 14 and 16
respectively of the Constitution. However, in the present case, the challenge
is not to the  Page 66 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT selection procedure adopted by the Committee. The
challenge is to the very policy of the IIM of allocating 50% marks to the viva
voce test.
47\. In Arti (supra), the challenge was to the admission of a number of
candidates to the M.B.B.S. course in the Government Medical College, Srinagar,
for the academic year 1980-81. The basis for the selection was threefold: (i)
merit in the qualifying examination (35 marks), (ii) objective test (35 marks)
and (iii) viva voce examination (30 marks). The viva voce examination was held
by the Selection Committee which determined the inter se merit on the strength
of : (a) physical fitness, (b) personality,
(c) aptitude, (d) general knowledge and (e) general intelligence. There was
also a distribution of seats into three distinct divisions. As many as 660
candidates appeared before the Selection Committee for the viva voce
examination at its sittings held for four days. A selection list was then
finalised taking into account the reservations made for the various categories
and classes and the names of 75 candidates were announced for admission. The
petitioners, who were not selected, challenged the selection, inter alia, on
two grounds: first, the allocation to the viva voce test of 30 per cent of the
total marks was patently unreasonable and arbitrary and, secondly, having
regard to the number of candidates interviewed and the time applied for
conducting the interview, no more than two minutes or so could have been given
on the average to the oral interview of each candidate which demonstrated that
the selection process was conducted in a perfunctory manner and there was no
real application of the mind to the selection of candidates. As regards the
first challenge, the Supreme Court referred to the decisions  Page 67 of 75
Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT in
A.Peeriakarappan v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1971 SC 2303, Nishi Maghu v.
State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR 1980 SC 1975 and Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib
(supra) and observed that the State Government would have done well to apply
its mind seriously to the evaluation of ratio between the three criteria
adopted for admission. However, it expressed its reluctance to interfere on
the said ground because a clear pronouncement that an allocation of more than
15% of the total marks to the viva voce examination would result in
constitutional invalidity had been made in Ajay Hasia's case (supra) after the
selection process in the case in hand had already been completed. The State
Government was, however, cautioned that "there is need to revise the marks
ratio because of the very real risk future selections will face on this
score". As regards the second challenge, the Supreme Court observed that it
was the case of the State Government itself that the time spent on
interviewing each candidate was approximately only four minutes. However, it
was held that there was no adequate material for striking down the selection
on the said ground. The Supreme Court, however, sounded the following note of
caution:
> "But here again the State Government would do well to note the observations
> made by this Court in Ajay Hasia (MANU/SC/0498/1980: AIR 1981 SC 487)
> (supra) in this matter, and to ensure that Selection Committees take care to
> devote sufficient time to the oral interview of individual candidates having
> regard to the several relevant considerations which must enter into their
> judgment respecting each candidate."

JUDGMENT
48\. It may be reiterated that there cannot be any hard and fast rule
regarding the extent of weightage that is to be given to the viva voce test as
against the written examination and there are a series of considerations for
conducting such a test which are best left to the experts in the field. As
observed in Lila Dhar's case (supra) and Ashok Kumar Yadav's case (supra), it
is not for the court to lay down, whether interview test should be held at all
or how many marks should be allowed for the interview test and the matters of
this nature are more appropriately left to the wisdom of the experts. It is
also relevant to note that no allegations of malafides have been levelled by
the petitioner against either the respondent, or the committee that conducted
the viva voce test, so as to invalidate the process.
49\. In our opinion, the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge
does not suffer from any material infirmity or jurisdictional error warranting
interference at our end in this Appeal. The learned Single Judge has taken the
pains to study, understand and discuss the entire admission policy of the IIM.
This is evident from the paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of the impugned judgment.
Ultimately, it is a policy decision. The role of statutory expert bodies on
education and role of courts are well defined by a simple rule. If it is a
question of education policy or an issue involving academic matter, the court
should keep their hands off. If any provision of law or principle of law has
to be interpreted, applied or enforced with reference to or connected with
education, the court will step in. This is what the Supreme Court observed way
back in the year 2009 in the case of All India Council for Technical Education
(supra). This decision of the Supreme Court has been rightly referred to by
the  Page 69 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020
CAV JUDGMENT learned Single Judge in paragraph 19 of the impugned judgment.
50\. The Supreme Court, in the case of Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of Bihar
and others, reported in (2010)12 SCC 576, had the occasion to consider the
very same question which we are called upon to decide as regards the
percentage of marks which ordinarily should be allocated for the purpose of
personal interview. In the case before the Supreme Court, the challenge was to
the decision of the Patna High Court, whereby the petitioner's challenge to
the earmarking of 200 marks for the viva voce test as against the 850 marks
for the written test for recruitment to the Bihar Civil Services (Judicial
Branch) was negatived. In the said case, the petitioner was one of the
candidates who had applied for selection pursuant to an advertisement dated
18th November 2005 issued by the Bihar Public Service Commission for
appointment of Civil Judges (Junior Division). After being declared successful
in the written examination, the petitioner was interviewed. However, his name
did not figure in the merit list prepared by the Commission. After nine
months, the petitioner filed a writ-petition questioning the constitutionality
of the Appendix-C of the Bihar Civil Service (Judicial Branch) (Recruitment)
Rules, 1955, on the ground that the marks prescribed for the viva voce test
were excessive and contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Ashok
Kumar Yadav (supra) and its various other decisions. The Supreme Court, after
an exhaustive review of its earlier decisions on the subject, ultimately
observed in paragraph 10 as under :
Page 70 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
> "10. The question whether the marks prescribed for viva voce test/interview
> are excessive and selection made in accordance with the criteria like the
> one specified in Rule 14 read with Appendix-C and para (vi) of the
> advertisement issued by the Commission has been considered by this Court in
> several cases including those upon which reliance has been placed by Learned
> Counsel for the Petitioner. Although, no straitjacket formula has been
> judicially evolved for determining whether the prescription of particular
> percentage of marks for viva voce test/interview introduces an element of
> arbitrariness in the process of selection or gives unbridled power to the
> recruiting authority/agency to select less meritorious candidates, by and
> large, the courts have not found any Constitutional infirmity in prescribing
> of higher percentage of marks for viva voce test/interview for recruitment
> to judicial services, administrative services and the like."
51\. Thus, the Supreme Court held that no straitjacket formula has been
judicially evolved for determining, whether the prescription of particular
percentage of marks of viva voce test/interview would introduce an element of
arbitrariness in the process of selection. The court further observed that the
Supreme Court, by and large, has not found any constitutionality infirmity in
prescribing of higher percentage of marks for the viva voce test/interview. Of
course, such observations fell from the Supreme Court in context with the
recruitment to the Judicial Services, Administrative Services and the like. By
and large, the same principle would apply even in the case on hand, wherein
the respondent is the IIM.

JUDGMENT
52\. There is one another important aspect taken note of by the learned Single
Judge. The learned Single Judge has taken notice of the fact, and in our
opinion, very rightly, that the appellant herein participated in the admission
process being fully aware of the standard of assessment laid down in the
prospectus. Once having participated in the admission process, being very much
aware of the fact that the final selection would be based on a diverse set of
attributes, which includes performances in the CAT, AWT and PI, thereafter, on
being unsuccessful, the appellant cannot come to a writ court and complain
that the policy of the respondent in allocating 50% marks to the viva voce
test is unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
53\. We have referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Manish Kumar
(supra) above. We have also stated that Manish Kumar (supra) arose from a
Division Bench judgment of the Patna High Court. The petitioner lost before
the Division Bench of the Patna High Court in challenging the legality and
validity of prescription of marks for the personal interview. The Division
Bench of the Patna High Court referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Madan Lal v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, reported in (1995)3 SCC 486, and held
thus :
> "In the light of the aforesaid legal position, it has to be held and we do
> hold that the Petitioner by his conduct has disentitled himself to any
> relief in the high prerogative jurisdiction of this Court. He was well aware
> when he  Page 72 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020
> C/LPA/388/2020 CAV JUDGMENT applied to appear in the 26th Judicial

> test. The Petitioner had no grievance about the criteria when he applied nor

> test.
Had he been successful, he would have no grievance at all about the provision
of maximum 200 marks for interview. Had he secured higher marks in the viva
voce test, he would have been happy with the provision made in the Rules. It
is only after the entire selection process has been over and he remained
unsuccessful that he thought of raising grievance about unreasonableness of
maximum 200 marks fixed for viva voce test. He approached the court much after
the entire selection process was over. BPSC had recommended the names of 318
candidates for selection and the Personnel and Administrative Reforms
Department, Government of Bihar appointed the selected candidates. The entire
selection process has been over. In our view, the same cannot be undone or
upturned at the instance of the Petitioner who approached the court only after
he remained unsuccessful in the examination on the plea that the provision of
200 marks for viva voce test out of total marks 1050 was unreasonable. If out
of 318 candidates who were recommended by the BPSC to the State Government for
appointment, any candidate did not join, that vacancy has to be carried
forwarded to the next year. There is no challenge to the circular issued by
the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department way back in the year 1977
that any vacancy having remained unfilled due to non-
Page 73 of 75 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 02 03:23:23 IST 2020 C/LPA/388/2020 CAV
JUDGMENT
joining of the selected candidates will be carried forwarded to the next
year."
54\. The aforesaid findings recorded by the Division Bench of the Patna High
Court ultimately came to be affirmed by the Supreme Court, holding as under :
> "We also agree with the High Court that after having taken part in the
> process of selection knowing fully well that more than 19% marks have been
> earmarked for viva voce test, the Petitioner is not entitled to challenge
