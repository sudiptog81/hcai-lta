                                  ORDER
PER B.R. BASKARAN, ACCOUNTANT MEMBER:
These cross appeals are directed against the order dated 24- 04-2014 passed by
Ld CIT(A)-IV, Bangalore and they relate to the assessment year 2005-06.
2\. Both the parties have filed revised grounds of appeal. The revenue is
contesting following issues:-
> (a) Whether the Ld CIT(A) was justified in directing deduction of Satellite
> link charges from Total turnover also while computing deduction u/s 10A of
> the Act.
> (b) Relief granted in respect of Transfer pricing adjustment.
3\. The assessee is in appeal in respect of following issues:-
> (a) Whether the tax authorities are justified in deducting Satellite link
> charges from Export turnover while computing deduction u/s 10A of the Act.
> (b) Transfer pricing adjustment sustained by Ld CIT(A).
4\. Facts relating to the case are discussed in brief. The original name of
the company was M/s Aztec Software & Technology Services Ltd. It has merged
with M/s Mindtree Limited. The assessee is engaged in developing software
solutions for its customers in USA. The Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) noticed
that there were contradictions between Transfer pricing report and Audit
report given in Form 3CEB with regard to the nature and amount of
international transactions pertaining to this year. Ultimately, the TPO
rejected the transfer pricing study of the assessee.
IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 3 of 17
5\. The TPO noticed that the turnover of the assessee was Rs.82.34 crores. The
TPO adopted Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as most appropriate method.
He adopted Operating Profit /Operating Revenue (OP/OR) as the Profit level
indicator. The TPO, by making his own search, selected following 17 comparable
companies.

6\. The average margin of above said comparables calculated at OP/TC was
26.59% and at OP/OR was 21%. The TPO computed the transfer pricing adjustment
as under:-
> IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 4 of 17

              Pertaining to related parties           16,11,91,000

8\. The AO completed the assessment by making the TP adjustment proposed by
the TPO. The assessee challenged the transfer pricing adjustment made by the
TPO by filing appeal before Ld CIT(A). The first appellate authority excluded
following five comparables accepting the contention of the assessee for
application of turnover filter.

In this regard, the ld CIT(A) followed the decision rendered by Bangalore
bench of Tribunal in the case of Genisys Integrating Systems Vs. DCIT (15 ITR
(Trib) 475) and certain other decisions, wherein identical view has been
expressed. In the above said cases, it was held that the companies having
turnover of less than 200 crores cannot be compared with the companies having
more than 200 crores. The turnover of the assessee company is Rs.82.34 crores
and hence it falls under the category of companies having turnover of 1 to 200
crores. The above said five companies are having turnover of more than 200
crores and hence the Ld CIT(A) held that these companies cannot be considered
as comparable companies.
9\. The assessee also sought exclusion of certain other companies on the
ground of functional dissimilarity. The Ld CIT(A), however, rejected the same
by following certain case laws. All those case laws had expressed the view
that once a company falls under the category of "software development
services, they cannot be excluded merely on the reason that they are operating
in different verticals.
10\. The revenue is in appeal challenging the decision of Ld CIT(A) in
excluding above said five comparable companies. The Ld D.R placed his reliance
on the decision rendered by Tribunal in the case of Wills Processing services
india (P) Ltd and also in the case of IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s.
Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 6 of 17 Societe Generale Global Solutions P Ltd
and contended that the turnover filter is not to be applied.
11\. On the contrary, the ld A.R supported the order passed by Ld CIT(A) on
this issue.
12\. We heard rival contentions and perused the record. The question of
application of turnover filter was examined by the co- ordinate bench in a
detailed manner in the case of Autodesk India (P) Ltd (2018)(96 taxmann.com
263)(Bang.) and it was held that the turnover filter can be applied. The
relevant discussions and decision taken by the co-ordinate bench are extracted
below for the sake of convenience:-
> IT(TP)A No.616/Bang/2013: Revenue's appeal for AY 2005-06
> 17\. The first issue to be decided in Revenue's appeal is the application of
> turnover filter for exclusion of companies that are otherwise found to be
> functionally comparable. The Grievance of the revenue in this regard is
> projected in Gr.No.2 of the Grounds of appeal raised by the revenue in its
> appeal. The basic facts to be noticed with regard application of turnover

> Rs.10.65 crores. The TPO excluded from the list of comparable companies
> chosen by the Assessee in its TP study companies whose turnover was less
> than Rs.1 Crore. The contention of the Assessee before the CIT(A) was that
> while the TPO excluded companies with low turnover, he failed to apply the
> same yardstick to exclude companies with high turnover compared to the
> Assessee. The reason for excluding companies with low turnover was that such
> companies do not reflect the industry trend as their low cost to sales ratio
> made their results less reliable. The contention of the Assessee was that
> there would be effect on profitability wherever there is high or low
> turnover and therefore companies with high turnover should also be excluded

17.1 The learned DR submitted that high turnover is not a relevant criterion
to regard a company as not comparable, so long as the two companies are
functionally comparable. If functions by two companies are identical then they
have to be regarded as comparable. According to him therefore the CIT(A) was
not justified in excluding 5 companies on the ground that their turnover was
above Rs.200 Crores and cannot be compared with the Assessee whose turnover
was around Rs.10.65 Crores. In support of his contention the learned DR placed
reliance on the following decisions:

17.2 The learned DR also filed before us a note contending that in software
industry, size has no influence on the margins earned by an entity. According
to him economies of scale are relevant only in capital intensive companies
which have substantial fixed assets in the form of plant and machinery.
According to him, in software industry, size does not matter, what matters is
the human capital. According to him application of the filter of turnover
might be justified for excluding companies with low turnover of say Rs.1 crore
or less because the margin earned by these companies might widely fluctuate
due to narrow capital base and lack of competitive strength, lack of
operational efficiencies and also lack of human resources. They also escape
the eyes of regulators. He drew our attention to the turnover and profit
margins of company Infosys Technologies Ltd. For FY 1997 to 2010 and submitted
that in FY 1997 the company had turnover of Rs.139 Crores and its profit
margin was 34.95% whereas in FY 2010 its turnover was Rs.21140 crores but its
profit margin was only 44.91%. According to him therefore the profit margins
hover between 35% and 40% over the period of 15 years and therefore high
turnover does not necessarily mean high profit margins. He also gave a chart
showing turnover and margin of 20 companies IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014
M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 8 of 17 in the IT-BPO industry for three
years. According to him the chart would show that for the same range of
turnover companies earned different profit margins. Therefore according to him
there is no relation between the margins earned and the turnover of a company.
According to him software industries operate on the basis of cost plus margin
of profits and therefore turnover would be irrelevant and have no impact of
the profit margins. His further submission was that under Rule 10B(3) of the
Income Tax Rules, 1962 (Rules) it is only functions performed, assets employed
and the risks assumed that are relevant criteria for comparison and turnover
is not a prescribed criterion for the purpose or comparison. He fairly
admitted that there are differences of opinion amongst various benches of the
Tribunal on the application of turnover filter and that some Benches have held
that high turnover was relevant criteria for excluding comparable companies.
His prayer in the alternative was for constitution of a special bench to
resolve the conflict.
17.3 Per Contra the learned counsel for the Assessee submitted that ITAT
Bangalore Bench in the case of Dell International Services India (P) Ltd. v.
Dy. CIT [2018] 89 taxmann.com 44 order dated 13.10.2017, considered the
various aspects of application of turnover filter for excluding companies and
has noted that the first decision rendered on application of this filter was
in the case of Genisys Integrating Systems (I)(P) Ltd. (supra) rendered on
5.8.2011. In the case of Dell International Services India (P) Ltd. (supra),
the tribunal took note of a divergent view expressed by ITAT Bangalore Bench
in the case of Robert Bosch Engg. and Business Solutions Ltd. v. Dy. CIT ITA
No.1519/Bang/2013 order dated 13.9.2017 after considering the decision
rendered by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Chryscapital
Investment Advisors India (P.) Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2017] 82 taxmann.com 167
(Delhi - Trib.), that high turnover ipso facto does not lead to the conclusion
that a company which is otherwise comparable on FAR analysis can be excluded
and that the effect of such high turnover on the margin should be seen. The
Tribunal in the case of Dell International (supra) also took note of the
decision of the ITAT Bangalore Bench in the case of Sysarris Software (P.)
Ltd. v. Dy. CIT [2016] 67 taxmann.com 243 (Bang. - Trib) wherein the Tribunal
after noticing the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of
Chryscapital Investment Advisors India (P.) Ltd. (supra) and the decision to
the contrary in the case of CIT v. Pentair Water India (P.) Ltd. [2016] 69
taxmann.com 180/381 ITR 216 (Bom.) wherein it was held that high turnover is a
ground to exclude a company from the list of comparable companies in
determining ALP, held that there were contrary views on the issue and hence
the view favourable to the Assessee laid down in the case of Pentair Water
India (P.) Ltd. (supra) should be adopted. The following were the conclusions
of the Tribunal in the case of Dell International (supra):
'41. We have given a very careful consideration to the rival submissions. ITAT
Bangalore Bench in the case of Genesis Integrating Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. DCIT, ITA No.1231/Bang/2010, relying on Dun and Bradstreet's analysis, held
grouping of companies having turnover of Rs.
IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 9 of 17 1
crore to Rs.200 crores as comparable with each other was held to be proper.
The following relevant observations were brought to our notice:-- "9. Having
heard both the parties and having considered the rival contentions and also
the judicial precedents on the issue, we find that the TPO himself has
rejected the companies which .ire (sic) making losses as comparables. This
shows that there is a limit for the lower end for identifying the comparables.
In such a situation, we are unable to understand as to why there should not be
an upper limit also. What should be upper limit is another factor to be
considered. We agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the
assessee that the size matters in business. A big company would be in a
position to bargain the price and also attract more customers. It would also
have a broad base of skilled employees who are able to give better output. A
small company may not have these benefits and therefore, the turnover also
would come down reducing profit margin. Thus, as held by the various benches
of the Tribunal, when companies which arc loss making are excluded from
comparables, then the super profit making companies should also be excluded.
For the purpose of classification of companies on the basis of net sales or
turnover, we find that a reasonable classification has to be made. Dun &
Bradstreet & Bradstreet and NASSCOM have given different ranges. Taking the
Indian scenario into consideration, we feel that the classification made by
Dun & Bradstreet is more suitable and reasonable. In view of the same, we hold
that the turnover filter is very important and the companies having a turnover
of Rs.1.00 crore to 200 crores have to be taken as a particular range and the
assessee being in that range having turnover of 8.15 crores, the companies
which also have turnover of 1.00 to 200.00 crores only should be taken into
consideration for the purpose of making TP study."
42\. The Assessee's turnover was around Rs.110 Crores. Therefore the action of
the CIT(A) in directing TPO to exclude companies having turnover of more than
Rs.200 crores as not comparable with the Assessee was justified. As rightly
pointed out by the learned counsel for the Assessee, there are two views
expressed by two Hon'ble High Courts of Bombay and Delhi and both are non-
jurisdictional High Courts. The view expressed by the Bombay High Court is in
favour of the Assessee and therefore following the said view, the action of
the CIT(A) excluding companies with turnover of above Rs.200 crores from the
list of comparable companies is held to correct and such action does not call
for any interference.' 17.4 His submission was that the decision rendered by
the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors
India (P.) Ltd. (supra) was not on the application of turnover filter. He
brought to our notice that the relevant substantial question of law in the
case of Christcapital decided by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court was (i) whether
comparables can be rejected on the ground that they have exceptionally high
profit margins as compared to the Assessee in Transfer Pricing Analysis.(ii)
Whether factors like differential functional and risk profile coupled with
high IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 10 of
17 degree of volatility in operating profit margins is sufficient ground to
reject comparables for transfer pricing analysis. In answering the above
question, the Hon'ble Court however at page 218 of the report (the said
decision is Chryscapital Investment Advisors India (P.) Ltd. (supra)) observed
that the mere circumstance that a company-otherwise confirming to the
stipulations in rule 10B(2) of the Rules in all details, presenting a peculiar
feature- such as a huge profit or a huge turnover, ipso facto does not lead to
its exclusion. The Court further observed that the Transfer Pricing officer,
first, has to be satisfied that such differences do not "materially affect the
price .......... or cost". Secondly, an attempt to make reasonable adjustment
to eliminate the material effect of such differences has to be made. According
to him therefore the observations of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in so far as
it relates to application of turnover filter are obiter dictum. Obiter dictum
though is entitled to a weight cannot be equated with ratio decidendi of a
case. In support of his contention as above, he relied on the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Director of Settlements A.P. v. M.R.
Apparao [2002] 4 SCC 638. Countering the submission of the learned DR that the
decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court rendered in the case of Pentair
(supra) is not ratio decidendi as it was merely dismissal of appeal u/s.260A
of the Act on the ground that no substantial question of law arose for
consideration, learned counsel drew our attention to the decision of the
Bombay High Court in the case of Pentair water India (P.) Ltd. (supra)
paragraph 9, wherein the Hon'ble Bombay High Court after referring to a
decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court rendered in the case of CIT v. Agnity
India Technologies (P) Ltd. [2013] 36 taxmann.com 289/219 Taxman 26 (Delhi),
clearly observed that turnover is obviously a relevant fact to consider the
comparability. Our attention was also drawn to paragraph-3 of the decision
rendered in the case of Pentair (supra) wherein the department specifically
contended that the Tribunal erred in holding that size and turnover of a
company are deciding factors for treating a company as comparable. According
to him therefore it was not a case of merely dismissal of appeal u/s.260A of
the Act as unadmitted on the ground that no substantial question of law arose
for consideration but was precedent in so far as the Hon'ble Court has
expressed a clear opinion on the issue. 17.5 The learned counsel for the
Assessee also drew our attention to a decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court
rendered in the case of Pr. CIT v. New River Software Services (P) Ltd. [2017]
85 taxmann.com 302 wherein the Hon'ble Delhi High Court followed the decision
of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court rendered in the case of Pentair (supra) and
held that Infosys BPO was rightly excluded as not being a comparable company.
Our attention was also drawn by him to a decision of the Hon'ble Punjab &
Haryana High Court in the case of CIT v. Mercer Consulting (I) (P) Ltd. [2016]
76 taxmann.com 153/390 ITR 615 wherein the Hon'ble Court held that a giant
company cannot be compared with a company which was a captive service provided
assuming limited risks.
17.6 As far as the decisions of the Tribunal rendered on the application of
turnover filter that are contrary to the decision rendered in the case IT(TP)A
Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 11 of 17 of
Genisys Integrating Systems (supra), the first submission of the learned
counsel for the Assessee was that those decisions were rendered at a later
point of time and were to be regarded as per incurium since these decisions
were also rendered by a bench of equal strength and either the subsequent
decisions refused to follow or were rendered in ignorance of an earlier
binding precedent. He submitted that if a bench of equal strength differs with
a view taken earlier, the proper course for them is to make a reference to
larger bench. They cannot refuse to follow a binding decision. If they do so,
the decisions so rendered have to be regarded as per incurium. Even if they
are rendered in ignorance of the earlier binding precedent, they have to be
regarded as per incurium. In this regard the learned counsel for the Assessee
placed reliance on the decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union
of India v. Raghubir Singh AIR 1989 SC 1933, Union of India v. S.K. Kapoor
[2011] 4 SCC 589 and Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State of Maharashtra [2014] 16 SCC
623. In the aforesaid decisions the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in a
situation where there are conflicting decisions of High Court on an issue
which are irreconcileable and pronounced by judges of co-equal strength, then
the earlier view has to be followed as the later decision has to be regarded
as per incuriam. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sundeep Kumar Bafna
(supra) held that a decision or judgment can also be per incuriam if it is not
possible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously pronounced judgment
of a Co-equal or Larger Bench and when High Courts encounter two or more
mutually irreconcilable decisions of the Supreme Court cited at the Bar, the
inviolable recourse is to apply the earliest view as the succeeding ones would
fall in the category of per incuriam. The following were the relevant
observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:
"19. It cannot be over-emphasised that the discipline demanded by a precedent
or the disqualification or diminution of a decision on the application of the
per incuriam rule is of great importance, since without it, certainty of law,
consistency of rulings and comity of Courts would become a costly casualty. A
decision or judgment can be per incuriam any provision in a statute, rule or
regulation, which was not brought to the notice of the Court. A decision or
judgment can also be per incuriam if it is not possible to reconcile its ratio
with that of a previously pronounced judgment of a Co-equal or Larger Bench;
or if the decision of a High Court is not in consonance with the views of this
Court. It must immediately be clarified that the per incuriam rule is strictly
and correctly applicable to the ratio decidendi and not to obiter dicta. It is
often encountered in High Courts that two or more mutually irreconcilable
decisions of the Supreme Court are cited at the Bar. We think that the
inviolable recourse is to apply the earliest view as the succeeding ones would
fall in the category of per incuriam."
It was therefore submitted by him that the earliest view rendered by the ITAT
Bangalore Bench in the case of Genisys Integrating (supra) should be followed.
IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 12 of 17
17.7 We have considered the rival submissions. The substantial question of law
(Question No.1 to 3) which was framed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the
case of Chryscapital Investment Advisors (India) Pvt. Ltd., (supra) was as to
whether comparable can be rejected on the ground that they have exceptionally
high profit margins or fluctuation profit margins, as compared to the Assessee
in transfer pricing analysis. Therefore as rightly submitted by the learned
counsel for the Assessee the observations of the Hon'ble High Court, in so far
as it refers to turnover, were in the nature of obiter dictum. Judicial
discipline requires that the Tribunal should follow the decision of a non-
jurisdiction High Court, even though the said decision is of a non-
jurisdictional High Court. We however find that the Hon'ble Bombay High Court
in the case of Pentair Water India (P.) Ltd. (supra) has taken the view that
turnover is a relevant criterion for choosing companies as comparable
companies in determination of ALP in transfer pricing cases. There is no
decision of the jurisdictional High Court on this issue. In the circumstances,
following the principle that where two views are available on an issue, the
view favourable to the Assessee has to be adopted, we respectfully follow the
view of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court on the issue. Respectfully following the
aforesaid decision, we uphold the order of the DRP excluding 5 companies from
the list of comparable companies chosen by the TPO on the basis that the 5
companies turnover was much higher compared to that the Assessee.
17.8 In view of the above conclusion, there may not be any necessity to
examine as to whether the decision rendered in the case of Genisys Integrating
Systems (I) (P.) Ltd. (supra) by the ITAT Bangalore Bench should continue to
be followed. Since arguments were advanced on the correctness of the decisions
rendered by the ITAT Mumbai and Bangalore Benches taking a view contrary to
that taken in the case of Genisys Integrating Systems (I) (P.) Ltd. (supra),
we proceed to examine the said issue also. On this issue, the first aspect
which we notice is that the decision rendered in the case of Genisys
Integrating Systems (I) (P.) Ltd. (supra) was the earliest decision rendered
on the issue of comparability of companies on the basis of turnover in
Transfer Pricing cases. The decision was rendered as early as 5.8.2011. The
decisions rendered by the ITAT Mumbai Benches cited by the learned DR before
us in the case of Willis Processing Services (supra) and Capegemini India (P.)
Ltd. (supra) are to be regarded as per incurium as these decisions ignore a
binding co-ordinate bench decision. In this regard the decisions referred to
by the learned counsel for the Assessee supports the plea of the learned
counsel for the Assessee. The decisions rendered in the case of NTT Data
(supra), Societe Generale Global Solutions (supra) and LSI Technologies
(supra) were rendered later in point of time. Those decisions follow the ratio
laid down in Willis Processing Services (supra) and have to be regarded as per
incurium. These three decisions also place reliance on the decision of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Chriscapital Investment (supra). We
have already held that the decision rendered in the case of Chriscapital
Investment (supra) is obiter dicta and that the ratio decidendi laid down by
the Hon'ble Bombay IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd.,
Bangalore  Page 13 of 17 High Court in the case of Pentair (supra) which is
favourable to the Assessee has to be followed. Therefore, the decisions cited
by the learned DR before us cannot be the basis to hold that high turnover is
not relevant criteria for deciding on comparability of companies in
determination of ALP under the Transfer Pricing regulations under the Act. For
the reasons given above, we uphold the order of the CIT(A) on the issue of
application of turnover filter and his action in excluding companies by
following the ratio laid down in the case of Genisys Integrating (supra)."
We have noticed that the Ld CIT(A) has followed the decision rendered by co-
ordinate bench in the case of Genisys Integrating Systems (supra) and the
decision rendered in the above said case was followed in the Autodesk India
(P) Ltd extracted supra. In the case of Autodesk India (P) Ltd, the co-
ordinate bench has distinguished the decisions relied upon by Ld D.R.
Accordingly, we uphold the order of Ld CIT(A) in excluding above said five
comparable companies applying turnover filter.
13\. We shall now take up the appeal of the assessee. Though the assessee has
raised many grounds, the ld A.R submitted that the assessee is seeking
exclusion of following four companies upheld by Ld CIT(A):-
> (a) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd
> (b) Tata Elxsi Ltd
> (c) Exensys Software Solutions Ltd
> (d) Thirdware Solution Ltd.
The Ld A.R submitted that all the above said four companies were examined by
the Bangalore bench of Tribunal in the case of CGI Information Systems &
Management Consultants (P) Ltd (IT(TP)A No.612/Bang/2013) on functionality
different basis. Accordingly, he prayed for exclusion of above said four
companies.
IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 14 of 17
14\. On the contrary, the Ld A.R submitted that the Ld CIT(A) has relied upon
certain case laws and held that the functionality difference cannot be a
criteria to exclude the companies.
15\. We have heard rival contentions and perused the record. We notice that
the Bangalore bench of Tribunal has excluded above said four companies holding
that these are not comparable companies in the case of CGI Information systems
& Management Consultants (P) Ltd (supra). The relevant discussions made by the
Tribunal in respect of above said four companies are extracted below:-
(A) Bodhtree Consulting Ltd:-
> 15.2. We have perused submissions advanced by both sides in light of records

> We find that Ld.CIT(A) directed their exclusion of these comparables as they

(B) Tata Elxsi Ltd:-

(C) Exensys Software Solutions Ltd:-

(D) Thirdware Solutions Ltd:-

16\. Following above said decision of the Tribunal, we direct exclusion of
above said four companies. The AO/TPO shall re- compute ALP of the
international transactions accordingly.
17\. The assessee has raised a ground as to whether the satellite charges
incurred in foreign currency are required to be reduced from export turnover
while computing deduction u/s 10A of the Act. The revenue has raised a ground
as to whether the Ld CIT(A) was justified in following the decision of
Karnataka High Court rendered in the case of Tata Elxsi Ltd, i.e., exclusion
of expenses incurred in foreign currency from both export turnover and total
turnover while computing deduction u/s 10A of the Act. The Ld A.R submitted
that the assessee would be satisfied, if parity is given in respect of
deduction from both export turnover and total turnover.
18\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has settled this issue in the case of CIT vs.
HCL Technologies Ltd (TS \- 218 - SC -2018). The relevant observations made by
Hon'ble Supreme Court are extracted below:-
> "20. Even in common parlance, when the object of the formula is to arrive at
> the profit from export business, expenses excluded from export turnover have
> to be excluded from total turnover also. Otherwise, any other interpretation
> makes the formula unworkable and absurd. Hence, we are satisfied that such
> deduction shall be allowed from the total turnover in same proportion as
> well.
> IT(TP)A Nos.349 & 878/Bang/2014 M/s. Mindtree Ltd., Bangalore  Page 17 of 17
> 21\. On the issue of expenses on technical services provided outside, we
> have to follow the same principle of interpretation as followed in the case
> of expenses of freight, telecommunication etc., otherwise the formula of
> calculation would be futile. Hence, in the same way, expenses incurred in
> foreign exchange for providing the technical services outside shall be
> allowed to exclude from the total turnover."
Accordingly, following the decision rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court, we
uphold the order passed by Ld CIT(A) on this issue.
19\. In the result, the appeal of the revenue is dismissed and the appeal of
the assessee is treated as allowed.
