same would be defeated.
24\. We therefore hold the learned trial Judge has applied the correct
position of law and has taken the right course of action, having found
similarity of the case with the earlier matter which was dealt with by the
appellate court in the judgment recorded by the learned trial Judge. It is
true that the plea of forum conveniens is to be pleaded and proved by the
party taking such a plea ordinarily, but when it is established on an
identically proven fact between the same parties, no such pleading is needed
for it would be mere repetition.
25\. According to us, the learned trial Judge had no option but to accept and
follow the judgment on an identical jurisdictional fact. Therefore, we do not
find any reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the Honble trial
Judge.
26\. The Writ Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. There will be no order as to
costs.

AND THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR WRIT APPEAL No.1346 OF 2012 Date:
03.12.2014 JUDGMENT: (Per the Honble The Chief Justice Sri Kalyan Jyoti
Sengupta) This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order of the
learned Single Judge, dated 9.3.2012, by which His Lordship was pleased to
dismiss the writ petition on the question of jurisdiction without deciding the
matter on merit. The writ petition (W.P. No.26300 of 2010) was filed by the
petitioner for the reliefs as set out hereunder:
2\. A writ of Mandamus declaring the advertisement of the 2nd respondents
applications in respect of MRC-7918, MRC-7041 BGII and MRC-7160 varieties in
the Plant Variety Journal of India without following the due procedure
specified under the provisions contained in Sections 19, 20, 21 read with
Rules 29 and 30 of Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001
as illegal and unconstitutional and for other allied reliefs.
3\. After the counter-affidavits were filed before the learned trial Judge,
the writ petition was called upon to be disposed of finally on the mention
made by the learned lawyer for the 2nd respondent that the jurisdictional
issues involved in the above writ petition were covered by the judgment
rendered by the Division Bench on 24.1.2012 in W.A.No.651 of 2010 and batch of
cases.
4\. From the tenor of the judgment of the learned trial Judge, it appears to
us that His Lordship was pleased to consider and decide the question of
territorial jurisdiction of this Court following the judgment of the Division
Bench as referred to above.
5\. While deciding, the learned trial Judge held that though part of the cause
of action in the writ petition disclosed by the petitioner had arisen within
the territorial jurisdiction of this High Court, because of forum conveniens
as held by the Division Bench on an identical jurisdictional fact, this Court
would not entertain the matter on merit. This matter, likewise previous one,
is to be decided by Honble Delhi High Court.
6\. In order to decide this appeal, we feel it expedient to narrate brief
facts pertaining to the issue of jurisdiction.
The 2nd respondent, while carrying on the same kind of business as the
petitioner is doing, has submitted applications to the 1st respondent under
Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001 (hereinafter
referred to as Act of 2001) for registration of the seed varieties being
numbers MRC-7918, MRC-7041 BGII and MRC-7160. The said applications have been
published in the Plant Variety Journal of India in Volume No.3 of Book No.4,
Volume No.3 of Book No.8 respectively inviting objections, if any. However,
while giving details of the seed varieties (hybrids), the 2nd respondent is
not mentioning the denominations of their parental lines, which would have
been prior notified and published in the Plant Variety Journals in accordance
with the provisions of the said Act and Rules framed thereunder for
registration.
7\. The provisions of the Act, Rules and Regulations thereof obviously have an
all India application, and the Journal is published throughout India for the
purpose of submitting objections. Objections can be submitted from any part of
the country, including by sending the same by registered post. Any farmer or
seed grower residing in any part of the country can maintain objections to the
particulars published in the journal. The journal is circulated throughout
India, including within the State of Andhra Pradesh, and in fact the
petitioner herein is registered as a recipient of the journal within the State
of Andhra Pradesh. In the writ affidavit to invoke territorial jurisdiction it
is stated as follows:-
The petitioner has its corporate office in the State of Andhra Pradesh and has
its major seed processing facilities within the State of Andhra Pradesh and
largely conducts its business within the State of Andhra Pradesh. The
registration of any variety would result in grant of indefeasible rights to
the applicant defeating the rights of others to use the said varieties. The
consequences of infringement, violations would visit the petitioner within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Honble Court.
8\. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that the learned
trial Judge has committed an error in dismissing the writ petition on the
concept of forum conveniens even after accepting that a part of the cause of
action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, as no
such specific plea was taken in the counter- affidavit.
9\. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, once it is held that a
part of the cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of
this Court, the Court has no option but to entertain the writ petition on
merit, as the language of clause (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution of
India is very clear. According to him, the impact of the advertisement of the
application has been felt by the petitioner in Hyderabad, therefore this part
of the cause of action is good enough for this Court to decide the matter on
merit invoking its jurisdiction.
10\. He has brought to our attention the following number of judgments of the
Supreme Court, wherein it was consistently held, considering a variety of
jurisdictional facts, that if part of the cause of action is found to have
arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of a particular High Court, it will
entertain the writ petition.
1\. S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v. Government of A.P.
2\. Union of India v. Adani Exports Limited
3\. Kusum Ingots & Alloys Limited v. Union of India
4\. Godrej Sara Lee Limited v. Reckitt Benckiser Australia Pty. Limited
5\. Om Prakash Srivatsava v. Union of India
6\. Oil & Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu
7\. State of Rajasthan v. Swaika Properties
8\. Alchemist Limited v. State Bank of Sikkim
11\. The learned Senior Counsel, Sri C.V. Mohan Reddy, appearing for the
respondents, on the other hand, says that on an identical jurisdictional fact,
a Division Bench of this Court has dismissed the writ application on the
ground of forum conveniens. As such, having found similarity of the
jurisdictional fact, the learned trial Judge has dismissed the writ petition.
He would rely on the same judgment of the Division Bench of this Court.
12\. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and reading the
statements and averments in the writ petition and considering the finding of
the Honble trial Judge, now the question which has fallen for decision of this
Court is as follows:
(i) Whether the learned trial Judge is justified in non- suiting the writ
petitioner even after observing that a part of the cause of action has arisen
in this matter within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, on the
concept of forum conveniens?
(ii) Whether the learned trial Judge is right in following the judgment of the
earlier Division Bench of this Court on the question of jurisdiction?
13\. The aforesaid decisions of the Apex Court cited by the learned counsel
for the appellant, in our view, have laid down a statement of law, having
noted the individual jurisdictional facts constituting part of the cause of
action.
14\. In the case of Union of India v. Adani Exports Limited (2 supra), the
Supreme Court, upon examining the jurisdictional fact, held that each and
every fact pleaded by the respondents (writ petitioner therein) in their
application does not ipso facto lead to the conclusion that those facts give
rise to a cause of action within the courts territorial jurisdiction unless
those facts are such, which have a nexus or relevance with the lis that is
involved in the case. Applying this principle, the Supreme Court held that
none of the facts pleaded by the respondents falls into the category of bundle
of facts which would constitute a cause of action giving rise to a dispute
which could confer territorial jurisdiction on the courts at Ahmedabad.
15\. Therefore, taking note of the jurisdictional facts pleaded in the above
case, the Supreme Court found that the concerned High Court had no territorial
jurisdiction. This judgment did not deal with concept of forum conveniens.
16\. In the case of S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v. Government of A.P. (1 supra), the
Supreme Court held that in the event of threatened or imminent violation of a
right, writ petition can be filed. This judgment recognizes pre-emptive
action, but this judgment has not dwelt upon the concept of forum conveniens.
17\. In the case of Kusum Ingots & Alloys Limited v. Union of India (3 supra),
the Supreme Court held that the question as to whether the Court has a
territorial jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition, must be arrived at on
the basis of the averment made in the petition, the truth or otherwise thereof
being immaterial.
It is further held that in order to confer jurisdiction on a High Court to
entertain a writ petition, it must disclose that the integral facts pleaded in
support of the cause of action do constitute a cause so as to empower the
Court to decide the dispute and that the entire or a part of the cause of
action arose within its jurisdiction. The facts pleaded in the writ petition
must have a nexus on the basis whereof a prayer can be granted. Those facts
which have nothing to do with the prayer made therein cannot be said to give
rise to a cause of action which would confer jurisdiction on the Court.
18\. In the case of Godrej Sara Lee Limited v. Reckitt Benckiser Australia
Pty. Limited (4 supra), the Supreme Court was dealing with a question of
jurisdiction in relation to cancellation of registration under the Designs
Act, 2000. It was held by the Supreme Court that the Court within whose
jurisdiction the registration has taken place will have jurisdiction.
19\. In the case of Om Prakash Srivatsava v. Union of India (5 supra), the
Apex Court has merely held, by necessary implication, the concept of forum
conveniens. In this case, the appellant filed a writ petition before the Delhi
High Court. The said High Court refused to consider that writ petition holding
that though it might have jurisdiction to deal with grievances of the
appellant but these could be more effectively dealt with by the Allahabad High
Court. In this case, the Supreme Court found that Delhi High Court did not
decide whether it had jurisdiction to deal with the writ petition. Therefore,
such question was asked to be decided. The concept of forum conveniens was not
accepted by the Supreme Court because there was no decision and finding as to
whether the Delhi High Court had jurisdiction or not.
20\. In the case of Oil & Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu (6
supra), the Supreme Court found that the Calcutta High Court had no
jurisdiction on the given statement and averment in the writ petition.
21\. In the cases of State of Rajasthan v. Swaika Properties (7 supra) and
Alchemist Limited v. State Bank of Sikkim (8 supra), the Court explained what
are part or whole cause of action, and if any part thereof arises within the
territorial limit of any particular High Court, it is competent to entertain
the writ petition.
22\. According to us, the concept of forum conveniens can be applicable when
it is found by the Court that a part of the cause of action has arisen within
the territorial limit of a number of Courts legally competent to entertain and
decide the lis and in the choice would be one of them for entertainment and
trial of the lis. We are of the view concept of forum conveniens would be
invoked when, on a given case, two or more Courts have territorial
jurisdiction basing on disclosure of the cause of action, one of such court is
to be chosen, within whose jurisdiction dominant part of the cause of action
has arisen.
23\. Viewing from this angle, we now examine the case on hand. Application for
registration has been made in New Delhi at the office of the 1st respondent;
in pursuance thereof advertisement is ordered from the office of 1st
respondent. Moreover, this plea can be entertained going by the jurisdictional
facts disclosed in the writ petition. Obviously, after receipt of objections,
decision for registration would be taken upon hearing by the first respondent
in New Delhi. It is not that registration shall automatically be granted. If
registration is granted, only then the writ petitioner would feel the impact.
If on this infinitesimal part of cause of action, that may not arise even,
this Court entertains this writ petition, then all High Courts over the
country within whose jurisdiction adverse impact of the same registration is
felt, would have to entertain number of writ petitions against the same
official respondent. The inevitable result would be inviting possible conflict
of judicial decisions, and the uniform judicial policy of avoidance of the
same would be defeated.
24\. We therefore hold the learned trial Judge has applied the correct
position of law and has taken the right course of action, having found
similarity of the case with the earlier matter which was dealt with by the
appellate court in the judgment recorded by the learned trial Judge. It is
true that the plea of forum conveniens is to be pleaded and proved by the
party taking such a plea ordinarily, but when it is established on an
identically proven fact between the same parties, no such pleading is needed
for it would be mere repetition.
25\. According to us, the learned trial Judge had no option but to accept and
follow the judgment on an identical jurisdictional fact. Therefore, we do not
find any reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the Honble trial
Judge.
26\. The Writ Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. There will be no order as to
costs.
Consequently, pending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall also stand
closed.
