    (based on weighted
    average for three
    years)
         The approach adopted by the tax payer:
In the TP study, the appellant created two segments as mentioned in Table 1
above. Operating Profit/Total Cost (OP/TC) was selected as the Profit Level
Indicator (PLI) under Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) as the most
appropriate method. The appellant had used 18 comparables in the software
segment which had a margin of 13% (based on three year's weighted average) and
7 comparables in Market Support Services segment with a margin of 11% (based
on three years weighted average) [see Table 1 above]. Therefore, the margin
earned by the appellant was held to be at arm's length by the TP study.
The approach adopted by the TPO: 5.3. The TPO rejected the comparable analysis
conducted by the appellant. TPO also gathered information from various
industry studies to understand the business profile of the industry. TPO
arrived at his own independent conclusions based on such studies. He rejected
some of the comparables of the appellant. The TPO conducted a fresh search for
the comparables. While doing so, TPO used different quantitative filters to
find a closer set of comparable companies. In the process, TPO used power u/s
133(6) to gather additional information from some of the  2 ITA No.
5865/Del/2012 AY: 2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
comparable companies. TPO issued a detailed show cause notice to the
appellant. The appellant replied to such show cause notices. The 1 PO
considered the reply filed by the appellant before passing the order. TPO used
single year data and allowed working capital adjustments. The TPO merged both
the segments of the appellant by stating that the market support service
segment is not having significant transaction and they are interrelated. TPO
followed the order of the earlier years of his predecessors so far as clubbing
of these two segments are concerned. The margins as determined by the TPO are
given in the Table 2 below:
Description Software development services and market support services segment
Number of comparables as per TPO 27 OP/TC margin (based on single year 23.28%
(page no.161 of the TPO data and after working capital order) adjustment)
3\. The Ld.Counsel for the assessee Sri S.D.Kapila submitted that the facts of
the case of the assessee are similar to the facts of the case of M/s Motorola
Solutions India Pvt.Ltd.(Motorola for short), which case was adjudicated by
the Delhi 'I' Bench of the Tribunal in ITA No.5637/Del/2011 vide order dt.
14.8.2014. He pointed out that the AY involved in the case of the assessee as
well as in the case of Motorola is AY 2007-08 and FAR of the tested party is
the same in both cases. He further submitted that the T.P.O. selected the same
26 comparables in both the cases for the purpose of bench marking. Hence his
submission is that the comparables picked up by the TPO in both the cases
being the same, the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Motorola on each
of these comparables has to be followed in the case of the assessee. He
submitted that he is not pressing ground no.4 and the second part of ground
no.2, which pertains to enhancement made by the  3 ITA No. 5865/Del/2012 AY:
2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
Ld.CIT(Appeals) for the reason that the Ld.CIT(Appeals) has rectified his
order u/s 154 of the Act.
4\. The Ld.Counsel for the assessee further submitted that, ground no.1 is
general in nature and ground no.3 also is not pressed. Ground no.11 was also
not pressed by the Ld.Counsel for the assessee without prejudice to his rights
to raise this issue during proceedings in future years. The reason for not
pressing this ground for the current year was smallness of the amount.
Thus this ground is dismissed with a rider that the decision shall not be a
precedent. All other grounds relate to inclusion of certain comparables by the
TPO, as upheld by the Ld.CIT(Appeals).
5\. The Ld.D.R. Mr.Peeyush Jain, on the other hand, opposed the contentions of
the assessee. He submitted that:
> (a) On the issue of employee cost filter, the TPO had laid down that all
> companies which have employee cost which is greater than 25% of their total
> revenues would be taken as comparables and this view of the TPO was upheld
> by the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Navisite India Pvt.Ltd.,
> in ITA no.2329/Del/2012 2013-TII-153-ITAT- DEL-TP. He pointed out that the
> author of the order in the case of Navisite India Pvt.Ltd. and in the case
> of Motorola (supra) was the same.
> (b) He relied on the decision of the Delhi 'A' Bench of the Tribunal in the
> case of Avaya India (P) Ltd. in ITA No. 5150/Del/2010 (2011-TII-139- ITAT-
> DEL-TP) specifically at para 19 and submitted that it was the TPO in that
> case who fixed the range of 30% to 60% for picking up comparables with
> filter of wages to sales ratio and it was only this decision of the TPO
> which was upheld. He further relied on the case of Vedaris Technology
> Pvt.Ltd. ITAT Delhi "H" Bench of the Tribunal in  4 ITA No. 5865/Del/2012
> AY: 2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
> ITA 4372/Del/2009 order dt. 31.3.2010 specifically at para 5.3. The sum and
> substance of his submission is that the Tribunal in its order in the case of
> Motorola had not considered the Coordinate Bench Order in the case of
> Navisite (supra) and had wrongly relied on the case of Avaya India (P) Ltd.
> (supra) as it was a case where the range was picked up by the TPO and not by
> the Bench of the ITAT. He further submits that if a range has to be applied,
> then if the employee cost is more than 90%, then the range of + 15% would be
> an absurd proposition.
> (c) On the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Motorola that certain
> comparables have to be excluded for the reason that they have created in-
> house assets resulting in higher profitability, Mr.Jain submits that the
> position of intangibles by itself can not lead to a conclusion that the
> comparable should be eliminated. He relied on the decision of the Hyderabad
> Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Deloitte Consulting India Pvt.Ltd. in
> ITA 1082, 1084/H/10 vs. DCIT. He further submitted that comparables cannot
> be eliminated on the ground of high turnover and for this proposition he
> relied on the judgement of Delhi High Court in the case of Agnity India
> Technologies (P) Ltd. 262 CTR (Delhi) 291.
> (d) On the issue of elimination of Persistent Systems India Ltd. On the
> ground that there are extra ordinary circumstances (acquisitions), he argued
> that if the acquisition or merger is of a company which is in the same line
> of business, then there should not be any difference and the elimination
> should not be there. On the exclusion on the ground that there is no
> credible information u/s 136, he submitted that the matter may be restored
> to the AO for fresh adjudication. On the criteria for exclusion adopted in
> the case of Motorola on the filter of related party transaction (hereinafter
> referred to as RPT) he submitted that the filter adopted by the TPO has to
> be upheld.
6\. Joining the issue, the Ld.Counsel for the assessee submitted that on
search, it is revealed that there is no software company which spends more  5
ITA No. 5865/Del/2012 AY: 2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
than 70% towards employees cost and hence the argument of the Ld.D.R.
that 15% range would result in absurd results if employee cost is 90% does not
hold water. He argued that the range determined by the Bench in the case of
Motorola is more scientific approach in picking up comparables. He contended
that the Tribunal has dealt at length on the issue of intangibles and other
assets used by each of the comparable and after detailed reasoning, came to a
conclusion that these comparables should be eliminated. On a query from the
Bench he agreed that in the case where employee cost filter has to be applied,
the issue if necessary, may be restored to the file of the TPO for
verification.
7\. Rival contentions heard. On a careful consideration of the facts and
circumstances of the case, on perusal of material on record, order of lower
authorities and case laws cited, we hold as follows.
8\. We are bound by the order of the Co-Ordinate Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of "Motorola"(supra) for the reason that the facts as well as the order
of the T.P.O. are identical.
8.1. We now consider each comparable by referring to the order of the ITAT in
the case of "Motorola"(supra).
(i) Accel Transmatic Ltd.:- The Tribunal in the case of Motorola Sales (supra)
at para 89 restored the issue to the file of the TPO to consider the
inclusion/exclusion of this comparable depending upon the finding of RPT.
Consistent with the view taken therein, we restore the matter to the file of
AO for following the decision of the Tribunal in the case of Motorola (supra).
6
ITA No. 5865/Del/2012 AY: 2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
(ii) Avani Cimcon Technologies Ltd:- The Tribunal directed exclusion of this
comparable for the reason that it own certain softwares developed by it and
the revenues earned are not merely on account of development of new software
from scratch but because of utilisation of own software also. It held that the
asset base of the company could not be compared with that of the tested party.
Consistent with the view taken by the ITAT in the case of Motorola (supra), we
direct the TPO to exclude this company from the list of comparables.
(iii) Celestial Labs:- The Tribunal observed that Celestial Labs is mainly
into software development services, in as much as, R&D facilities have been
used by it in relation to development of a software for discovery of new
drugs. It was engaged in bioforma and biotech manufacturing of customised
I.T.solutions, manufacturing of trucks, and contract research activities. At
para 93.2 of the ITAT order, the reasons are given as to why this company
should be excluded from the comparables. Consistent with the view taken
therein we direct the AO to exclude this comparable
(iv) KALS Information Systems:- At para 94.1 the Tribunal directed the AO to
exclude this comparable on the ground that there is a difference in the asset
base of both the companies. We follow the same and direct the AO to exclude
this comparable.
(v) E-Zest Solutions:- We restore this issue to the file of the TPO to examine
the reply of the assessee and adjudicate the matter afresh as was done in the
case of Motorola (supra).
(vi) Flextronic Software Systems Ltd.:- At para 97.2 the Tribunal in the case
of Motorola (supra) held that the company cannot include a comparable as there
is a clear contradiction in the contents of the annual report and the
information obtained u/s 136, hence this comparable has to be excluded for the
same reason.
(vii) Infosys Technologies Ltd.:- The reasons given in this comparable has to
be excluded by following the decision of the Jurisdictional  7 ITA No.
5865/Del/2012 AY: 2007-08 M/s Freescale Semiconductor India Pvt.Ltd.
High Court in the case of CIT vs. Agnity India Technologies Pvt.Ltd.(2013) 262
CTR (Del) 291.
(viii) Ishir Infotech Ltd.:- Consistent with the view taken in Motorola
(supra) we restore the matter to the file of the AO to provide information
obtained u/s 133(6) to the assesse and thereafter decide the issue de novo.
(ix) Helios & Matheson Information Technologies Ltd.:- For the reasons given
while restoring the matter in Asian Infotec Ltd., we restore this comparable
also to the file of the TPO.
(x) Lucid Software Ltd.:- As the comparable has been excluded by the TPO
himself for the AY 2008-09 the TPO is directed to exclude the comparable as in
the case of Motorola (supra).
(xi) Sasken Communication Technologies Ltd.:- The company has to be excluded
as it owns IPRs and had branded products by following the decision of the
Tribunal in the case of Motorola (supra) at para
111\.
(xii) Tata Elxis Ltd.:- The Tribunal directed the exclusion of this comparable
for the reason that the software developed by this company were used as tools
in development of new softwares at para 113.1 of the order. Consistent with
the view taken therein, we direct the AO to exclude this comparable.
(xiii) Wipro Ltd.:- For the reasons given while directing exclusion of Infosys
Ltd., as a comparable we direct the AO to exclude this comparable also.
(xiv) Persistent Systems Ltd.:- This should be excluded on the same grounds on
which the Ld.CIT(A) has excluded the case of Megasoft.
