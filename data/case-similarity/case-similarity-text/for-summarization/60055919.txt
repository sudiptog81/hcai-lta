PER N.V.VASUDEVAN, J.M, ITA No.1810/M/05 is an appeal by the Revenue and ITA
No.1905/M/05 is an appeal by the Assessee. Both these appeals are directed
against the order dated 15.12.2004 of CIT(A)-X, Mumbai, relating to A.Y.01-02:
2 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
2\. First we shall take up for consideration ITA No.1905/M/05, appeal by the
Assessee. Ground No.1 to3 raised by the Assessee reads as follows:
> "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> Assessing Officer in disallowing an amount of Rs. 39,407/- being the
> employer's contribution to Provident fund paid after the due date but before
> the end of the accounting year relevant to assessment year 2001-2002 under
> section 43B.
> 2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> Assessing Officer in making an addition of Rs.4,484/- being the employees'
> contribution to provident fund paid after the due date but before the end of
> the financial year relevant to assessment year 2001- 2002 under section
> 36(1)(va) read with section 2(24)(x).
> 3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> Assessing Officer in a disallowing an amount of Rs.55,825/- in respect of
> the employer's contribution to Employees State Insurance Corporation under
> section 43B."
3\. It is not in dispute that the addition sustained by the CIT(A) were
employers and employees contribution to Provident Fund and ESIC on the ground
that the same were not paid on or before the due date as envisaged under the
relevant law relating to the Provident Fund and ESIC. It is not in dispute
that the payments were made on or before the due date for filing the return of
income for the A.Y. in question. In CIT Vs. Alom Extrusions Ltd. 319 ITR 306
(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the claim for 3 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) deduction
u/s.43-B of the Act in respect of contribution to Provident Fund. Sec.43-B
provides that Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provisions of
the ITAct, 1961, a deduction otherwise allowable under the said Act in respect
of any sum payable by the Assessee as an employer by way of contribution to
any provident fund or superannuation fund or gratuity fund or any other fund
for the welfare of the employees shall be allowed as deduction only in
computing the income referred to in section 28 of that previous year in which
such sum is actually paid. Thus the above provision which are incorporated in
Sec.43-B (b) applies to contribution by an Assessee of his share of
contribution i.e,, employers share, to provident fund in respect of an
employee. Section 4 3-B was inserted with effect from 1st April, 1984, by
which with regard to tax, duty and contribution to welfare funds, it became
mandatory for the assessee (s) to account for the afore- stated items not on
Merchantile basis but on cash basis. In other words they had to claim
deduction on account of aforesaid payments as expenditure only in the previous
year in which they actual pay the tax, duty and contribution to welfare fund.
This situation continued between 1st April, 1984, and 1st April, 1988, when
the Parliament amended Section 4 3-B and inserted first proviso to Section
43-B. By this first proviso, it was, inter alia, laid down, any tax duty, cess
or fee payable by the assessee(s) if an assessee(s) pays such tax, duty, cess
or fee even after the closing of the 4 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) accounting year but before the date of filing of
the Return of income under Section 139(1) of the Act, the assessee(s) would be
entitled to deduction under Section 43-B on actual payment basis and such
deduction would be admissible for the accounting year. This proviso, however,
did not apply to the contribution made by the assessee(s) to the labour
welfare funds (which were covered by provisions of clause(b) to Section 43-B
of the Act). Vide Finance Act, 1988, the second proviso came to be inserted
(which covered contributions to labour welfare funds by an Assessee to which
provisions of clause(b) to Section 43-B of the Act applied). It reads as
follows:
> "Provided further that no deduction shall, in respect of any sum referred to
> in clause (b), be allowed unless such sum has actually been paid during the
> previous year on or before the due date as defined in the Explanation below
> clause (va) of sub-section (1) of section 36."
> "Explanation.-- For the purposes of this clause, "due date' means the date
> by which the assessee is required as an employer to credit an employee's
> contribution to the employee's account in the relevant fund under any Act,
> rule, order or notification issued thereunder or under any standing order,
> award, contract of service or otherwise."
4\. The second proviso stood further amended vide Finance Act, 1989, with
effect from 1st April, 1989, which reads as under:
> "Provided further that no deduction shall, in respect of any sum referred to
> in clause (b), be allowed unless such sum has actually been paid in cash or
> by issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode on or before the due date
> as defined in the Explanation below clause (va) of sub-section (1) of
> section 36, and where such payment has been 5 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y.
> 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02)
> ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) made other wise than in cash, the sum has
> been realised within fifteen days from the due date."
Explanation below clause (va) of sub-section (1) of Section 36 reads as
follows:
> "Explanation.-- For the purposes of this clause, `due date' means the date
> by which the assessee is required as an employer to credit an employee's
> contribution to the employee's account in the relevant fund under any Act,
> rule, order or notification issued thereunder or under any standing order,
> award, contract of service or otherwise."
5\. The question arose before the Hon'ble Supreme Court as to whether the
deletion of the said second proviso and amendment of the first proviso was
retrospective or prospective. The Hon"ble Supreme Court held that the deletion
had retrospective effect:
(i) The deletion of the second proviso to s. 43B, and the amendment to the
first proviso, by the Finance Act, 2003 was to overcome implementation
problems. Consequently, the amendments, though made applicable by Parliament
only with effect from 1.4.2004, were curative in nature and would apply
retrospectively w.e.f. 1.4.1988.
(ii) In Allied Motors 224 ITR 677 (SC) it was held that even though the first
proviso to s. 43B was inserted w.e.f 1.4.1988, it operated retrospectively
from 1.4.1984.It was held that when a proviso is inserted to remedy unintended
consequences and to make the section workable it could be read retrospective
in operation. This principle applies to the deletion of the second proviso as
well.
(iii) if the contention of the Department that the deletion of the second
proviso is prospective is accepted, there will be hardship and invidious
discrimination because assessee who have paid the contributions after the 6
ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) due date will be
denied deduction for all times while a defaulter who pays the contribution
after 1st April, 2004 would get the benefit of deduction under s. 43-B.
(iv) Though Parliament has explicitly stated that the amendment will operate
w.e.f. 1.4.2004, as a principle of construction the intention should be
determined from the language used by the Legislature and if strict literal
construction leads to an absurd result, i.e., a result not intended to be sub-
served by the object of the legislation, then if another construction should
be preferred.
6\. In view of the aforesaid decision, the employers contribution paid to
Provident Fund and Employees State Insurance Corporation on or before the end
of the accounting year has to be allowed as a deduction. Thus ground No.1 and
3 are allowed
7\. As far as Ground No.2 is concerned, In CIT vs. AIMIL Limited The Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in ITA No. 1063 of 2006 ITA No.755 of 2008 ITA No. 204 of
2009 ITA No. 1214/2008 with ITA No. 1246/2008 ITA No. 50/2009 ITA No. 78/2009
judgment dated December 23, 2009 had to deal with a case of disallowance
u/s.36(1)(va) of the Act. The Hon'ble Court discussed the provisions of S. 2
(24) (x) which provides that amounts received by an assessee from employees
towards PF contributions etc shall be "income" and S. 36 (1) (va) which
provides that if such sums are contributed to the employees account in the
relevant fund on or before the 7 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) due date specified in the PF etc legislation, the
assessee shall be entitled to a deduction. The Court also noticed that the
second Proviso to s. 43B (b) provided that any sum paid by the assessee as an
employer by way of contribution to any provident fund etc. shall be allowed as
a deduction only if paid on or before the due date specified in 36(1)(va).
After the omission of the second Proviso w.e.f 1.4.2004, the deduction is
allowable under the first Proviso if the payment is made on or before the due
date for furnishing the return of income. In Alom Extrusions 319 ITR 306 (SC),
the deletion of the second Proviso has been held to be with retrospective
effect. The High Court had to consider whether the benefit of s. 43B can be
extended to employees' contribution as well which are paid after the due date
under the PF law but before the due date for filing the return. The Hon'ble
Court held that:
(i) Though the revenue has argued that a distinction is to be made between
"employers' contribution" and "employees' contribution" and that employees'
contribution being in the nature of trust money in the hands of the assessee
cannot be allowed as a deduction if not paid on or before the due date
specified in the PF etc law, the scheme of the Act is that employees'
contribution is treated as income u/s 2 (24) (x) on receipt by the assessee
and allowed as a deduction u/s 36 (1) (va) on making deposit with the
concerned authorities. S. 43B (b) stipulates that such deduction would be
permissible only on actual payment;
(ii) The question as to when actual payment should be made is answered by
Vinay Cements 213 CTR 268 where the deletion of the second Proviso to s.
8 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) 43B w.e.f
1.4.2004 was held applicable to earlier years as well. As the deletion of the
2nd Proviso is retrospective, the case has to be governed by the first
Proviso. Dharmendra Sharma 297 ITR 320 (Del) & P.M. Electronics 313 ITR 161
(Delhi) followed;
(iii) If the employees' contribution is not deposited by the due date
prescribed under the relevant Acts and is deposited late, the employer not
only pays interest on delayed payment but can incur penalties also, for which
specific provisions are made in the Provident Fund Act as well as the ESI Act.
Therefore, the Act permits the employer to make the deposit with some delays,
subject to the aforesaid consequences. Insofar as the Income-tax Act is
concerned, the assessee can get the benefit if the actual payment is made
before the return is filed, as per the principle laid down in Vinay Cement.
8\. In view of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, the
employees contribution to Provident Fund on or before the end of the Financial
year is also directed to be allowed as a deduction. Ground No.2 of the
Assessee is allowed.
9\. Ground No.4 raised by the Revenue and Gr.No.2 raised by the Revenue can be
conveniently decided together. These grounds read as follows:
Ground No.4 of the Assessee reads as follows:
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of
> Assessing Officer in disallowing depreciation of Rs. 1.30 crore on
> Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on the ground that the said IPR comprised
> of skills for operation and maintenance of hardware and 9 ITA
> NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
> NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) software which
> were not covered within the meaning of intangible assets and accordingly,
> not eligible for depreciation under section 32."
Ground No.2 of the Revenue reads as follows:
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case as well as in law, the
> Learned CIT(A) has erred in directing the Assessing Officer that
> depreciation on EDP equipment, application and systems software should be
> allowed as claimed by the assessee company without appreciating the fact
> that value adopted by the assessee company at Rs. 2.50 crores and Rs. 5
> crores respectively for working depreciation is excessive than the value
> shown in the books of the sister concern and which results in excessive
> depreciation.
10\. M/s. Mukund Ltd. had an Electronic Data Processing Department (EDP)
carrying on various I.T. related activities which, inter alia, include
Software Development Projects, Data Processing, Net Working, Accounting System

Co., two well know firms of Chartered Accountants. The equipments were also
valued by D.K. Nagarseth & Associates, Chartered Engineers. The amount paid

The A.O noticed that the computer software purchased by the seller i.e. Mukund
Ltd. is under lease and hire purchase agreement,. Clause 2.1.3 of the
agreement for sale by which assessee acquired these assets provided:
> "Seller undertakes to complete necessary documentation for transfer of
> computer hardware under lease and hire purchase covered in Annexure 2 & 3 in
> the name of the purchaser within 30 days or any other date agreed between
> the parties mutually of the signing of this agreement. The obligations under
> these lease/hire purchase agreements shall be to the account of the
> purchaser with effect from 1st October,2000. As the agreement of Hire
> Purchaser for AS-400 model 720 machine is executed recently, the purchaser
> also agrees to 13 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y.

> reimburse the Seller, the margin money paid by the seller and interest till
> the date of assignment."
According to the AO once the lease and hire purchase agreement is transferred
in the name of the assessee the assets also necessarily has to be transferred
at the book value of Mukund Ltd. which was Rs. 1.70 crores. According to the
AO, the assessee cannot substitute value based on non government approved
valuer when the value of these assets are readily ascertainable from the hire
purchase and lease agreement and also from the fixed asset register of the
Mukund Ltd. The value attributable to these leased assets can at best be the
purchase/market value if the assets have been acquired recently or the value
as per the lease agreement or the book value in the books of account of Mukund
Engineers. The A.O was also of the view that Computer is an asset on which
depreciation @60% is allowed under the I.T. Act. Such a high rate of
depreciation was granted for the asset computer, in view of the high rate of
obsolescence and fast changing technology. In present times the software which
is developed becomes obsolete very fast. The application software necessarily
facilitates better and more effective use of the computer. However, the use is
limited to a specific period. The assessee instead of paying less than the
market value has acquired these computers at a value which is about 150% of
the book value which cannot be accepted. Even the External Valuer has valued
the entire 14 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y.
2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
assets of the EDP division at Rs. 45 lacs while following the Net Assets Value
method. In view of the above the AO held that the purchase transaction of
computers is not at arm's length. He held that the depreciation can only be
allowed at the value at which these assets were standing in the books of
accounts of Mukund Ltd. which is Rs. 1.70 crores. Any consideration given over
and above the book value was held to be not paid for business reasons. The
depreciation allowable was worked by the AO as under:-
    S.No.   Assets                       Depreciation    Rate        of   Depreciation      Rate        of

                                                                          Ltd.(allowable)

Accordingly depreciation amounting to Rs. 14,425,555/- - Rs.8,608,008 =
Rs.5,817,546/- was disallowed.
II. Application and Systems Software:
The assessee contended that it had acquired from Mukund Ltd. application and
system software in running mode, valued at Rs. 5 crores. The assessee has
capitalized the same in its books and claimed depreciation thereon @ of 60%
amounting to Rs. 3 crores. The application software acquired by the assessee
comprised of :

                                                           ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
       -      Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
       -      JD Edwards Worldsoft 7.3 cum. 10
       -      Manufacturing, Distribution and Finance modules.
       -      60 concurrent users.
The assessee's claim of depreciation of Rs. 3 crores on the ERP package was
rejected by the AO for the following reasons:
(i) The ERP package is not freely tradeable in the open market since it is a
patented software which can be acquired only from a Registered Dealer. Mukund
Ltd. had acquired this software in the year 1994 and in the same year the
entire cost of acquisition was claimed as a revenue expenditure.
(ii) The agreement of sale under which the assessee purchased the software
also clearly stipulates, that the ERP software will be used exclusively for
Mukund Ltd. The assessee had contended that the application and systems
software which has a book value of Rs. NIL in the books of accounts of Mukund
Ltd. has been agreed at Hi-tech price of Rs. 5 crores by the assessee to
expand its sphere of work for its Infotech Division.
(iii) The EDP division was an integral part of functioning of Mukund Ltd. as
it undertook the processing of data for the company. In the year 1995, IBM AS/
400 mid range computer system was installed along with the ERP solution JD
Edwards, which is the total 16 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) solution for a company's major commercial
application and the ERP system was in the F.Y. 2000-01 in the process of
implementing other systems for Mukund Ltd. It was also, in the process of
establishing leased line connectivity between two different units of Mukund
Ltd. This clearly implies that the entire performance of Mukund Ltd. is
heavily dependent on the ERP package and this transaction to transfer the ERP
package to the assessee can only be a paper transaction to reduce the profits
of the assessee as this ERP package has to be utilized exclusively by Mukund
Ltd. even after this paper transfer of the software.
(iv) Looking at the above facts, the AO was of the view that the payment of
Rs. 5 crores to acquire this ERP package from Mukund Ltd. for the sole use of
the latter is not governed by any prudent business agency. The ERP package is
not for use in the assessee's infotech business but can be only used
exclusively for as an accounting package, for maintaining the accounts of
Mukund Ltd. According to the AO the assessee has indulged in a paper
transaction to claim higher depreciation in order to reduce its business
income. The entire transaction is not at arms length but done with the sole
intention to reduce the tax liability.
17 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
(v) The value of the ERP package as per books of Mukund Ltd. on the date of
sale was Nil and the sum of Rs.5 crores paid over and above the WDV was held
by the AO to be paid for consideration other than business. Accordingly the
claim of depreciation of Rs. 3 crores was disallowed.
III. Intellectual property rights comprised of all technical skill for
operation and maintenance of hardware and software. The assessee had claimed
depreciation on this human resources @ 25% amounting to Rs. 1.30 cores. As per
clause 3.1 of the agreement for sale under which the Assessee purchased the
EDP division from Mukund Ltd., it was provided as follows:
> "The parties agree that it is an essential term of this agreement that the
> skills required for the operation and maintenance of the Hardware and
> Software shall be made available to the purchaser within 30 days or any
> other date agreed between the parties mutually of the signing of this
> agreement at cost, that is to say on no profit no loss basis."
The assessee contended that it has taken over the services of approximately 30
to 35 employees who are erstwhile employees of Mukund Ltd. The Assessee
claimed that these employees were computer trained. The skills of the
erstwhile employees of Mukund Ltd. have been assessed and valued by the
assessee, by its own internal valuer Mr. K.L. Mehta at Rs. 5.20 crores. The
assessee has further stated that these employees are having experience of
about 30 to 35 years and are a great asset to the organization.

NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) The claim of the
assessee was not accepted by the AO for the following reasons.
(i) Depreciation can be allowed under the I.T. Act only if conditions stated
in Sec. 32 of the I.T. Act are satisfied. Section 32 of the Income-tax Act,
1961 Clause (b) below explanation (3) to section 32(1) defines intangible
assets as Intangible assets, being know-how, patents, copy rights, trade
marks, licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of
similar nature.
Explanation 4 further clarifies that for the purpose of these subsection the
expression "know-how" means any industrial information or technique likely to
assist in the manufacture or processing of goods or in the working of a mine,
oil well or other sources of mineral deposits "including searching or
discovery or testing of deposits for the winning of access"
From the plain reading of the above provisions it is clear that human
resources can by no stretch of imagination qualify for intangible assets as
defined in Sec. 32(1) of the I.T. Act and are hence not eligible for
depreciation.
19 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
(ii) The term 'technical know-how' used in section 32 referred above is not
the same thing as operation skills of employees alleged to be acquired by the
assessee.
(iii) The skills for operation and maintenance of hardware and software
belongs to the human employees of Mukund Ltd. It is a personal individual
asset of a human being. It is not capable of being owned and capitalized by a
company.
(iv) There is no provision in the Income-tax Act, 1961 to allow depreciation
on skilled manpower.
(v) What has been acquired is not an Intellectual property right, there is no
tangible or intangible asset as defined in the I.T. Act which has been
acquired by the assessee. What has been acquired can at best be said to be
services of the skilled workers, previously employed by Mukund Ltd., and it is
only the salary and other perquisites which at best can be paid and claimed by
the assessee as a revenue expenditure.
(vi) The foremost precondition for grant of claiming depreciation is that the
asset must be owned by the company. The employees cannot be said to be owned
by the assessee.

NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03)
(vii) The assessee has not obtained any bond, restricting these employees from
leaving its service, or stipulating the period of service.
(viii) The assessee has taken over employees of M/s. Mukund ltd. and assigned
value to them. Employees are manpower and are paid higher salary to compensate
for their skills and better experience rendered by them. The technical skills
of human resources for operation and maintenance of hardware and software are
such that these items can not be capitalized in the books of accounts. In fact
when these employees were working for M/s. Mukund Ltd., no such value was
assigned to them. What these employees were receiving was only salary and this
was the only revenue expenditure claimed by M/s. Mukund Ltd.
As the manpower resources are not covered within the meaning of intangible
asset as defined in sec. 32 of the Act and are not depreciable assets, the
claim of allowance of depreciation u/s. 32 of the Act on these human resources
were disallowed amounting to Rs. 1.3 crores. Thus the total disallowance on
account of depreciation as discussed in the paragraphs above was as under:-

14\. Before CIT(A), the assessee submitted that: (1) the surplus on sale of
EDP Division has been offered to for by Mukund Ltd., the seller by reducing
the value of the assets and sold from the respective block of assets.
(2) The assessee after acquiring the EDP Division from Mukund Ltd. was
rendering infotech services to Mukund Ltd., and was getting Rs. 30 lacs per
month from them towards EDP services rendered. The assessee had between the
period from Oct. 2000 to July 2004 received an aggregate amount of Rs. 13.80
crores from Mukund Ltd. towards EDP charges as against Rs. 12.70 crores paid
by the assessee to acquire the EDP Division from M/s. Mukund Ltd. Thus the
assessee pointed out that the allegation of the Assessing Officer that the
transaction of sale by Mukund Ltd. to the assessee of the EDP Division was
only a paper transaction to reduce tax liability by claiming higher
depreciation is not true. The allegation of the 22 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y.
2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02)
ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) Assessing Officer that the transaction was
not a prudent business transaction is also not correct.
(3) With regard to disallowance of depreciation on EDP equipments including
furniture and fixtures, the assessee pointed out that the assessee assigned
value of Rs. 2.5 crores to these assets. The internal valuer of the assessee
had given an item wise valuation and on that basis the values recorded in the
books of accounts of the assessee. The value assigned by the External Values
was the book value but the value assigned by the internal valuer is the market
value. No fault has been found in such valuation by the Assessing Officer. It
was further pointed out that for the purpose of allowing depreciation the
Assessing Officer has to look at the provisions of Sec. 43(1) which define
"Actual Cost" as the cost of Assets to the assessee. It was submitted that the
cost as recorded by the assessee in its books based on the valuation by the
valuer was its cost. The WDV of the Assets in the books of the seller is
irrelevant. It was argued that if the Assessing Officer disputed the valuation
i.e. the Actual Cost as recorded by the assessee in its books he ought to have
resorted to the provisions of Explanation-3 to Sec. 43(1) which casts a duty
on the Assessing Officer to establish that the purpose of transfer of assets
was to reduce tax liability of the assessee by claiming higher depreciation.

NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) (4) With regard
to disallowance of depreciation on Application Software System, the assessee
submitted that the Assessing Officer made the disallowance of depreciation on
the ground that almost all software are not freely tradeable in the open
market and normally are patented. Software also comes with a condition that it
would only be exclusively used on a particular system where installed. Even
simple packages like Microsoft Office and Windows are not tradeable in the
open market and can be only exclusively used in the computer in which they are
installed. In fact what is purchased by paying for the software is the right
to use. The assessee invited attention to Appendix I to the Income-tax Rules,
1962 which g gives the rates at which depreciation is allowable where in item
III(5) refers to computers including computer software. Note No.7 to the said
Appendix clarifies that "Computer Software" means any computer programme
recorded on any disc, tape, perforated media or other information storage
device. when the entire EDP Department was purchased, the said purchase would
be meaningless if the associated software is not purchased together. As regard
the allegation that the transaction is only a paper transaction the assessee
submitted that they were planning to go in a very big way into infotech
business to take advantage of the software boom at that time. In fact, they
had already associated themselves with IBM, one of the leading brands in
computer, and had set up an IBM Authorised Training Centre at 24 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) Kurla for high
end computer training and also for ERP Training. It was felt that if the
company concentrates on the computer and software segment it would be able to
establish itself as one of the leading companies in the sector. Accordingly,
the entire EDP division of Mukund Ltd. was acquired including its trained
manpower which would give the assessee a head start into this activity. Both
the companies involved are public limited companies and though they may be
belonging to the same group, the transaction has been carried out at arms
length and the consideration has been determined on the basis of the valuation
report of M/s. Dalal & Shah and M/s. N.M. Raiji & Co., two very reputed firms
of Chartered Accountants. The assessee further submitted that they are
receiving an amount of Rs. 30 lacs a month from Mukund Ltd. towards EDP
services and accordingly an amount of Rs. 3.60 crores is received annually.
(5)With regard to disallowance of depreciation on technical skills purchased
on the ground that they were intellectual property rights, the assessee
submitted that the said payment is more in the nature of technical know- how
which is received in the form of skilled manpower and the same would be
covered as an intangible asset as a commercial right.
15\. The CIT(A) on consideration of the above submissions held that under
"Section 43(1) of the I.T. Act, defines "actual cost" means 'actual cost' of
the 25 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) asset to the
assessee reduced by that portion of the cost thereof, if any, as has been made
directly or indirectly by any person or authority. The aforesaid provisions of
the I.T.Act has got one exception in the form of Explanation 3 to section
43(1) of the I.T. Act, which reads as under:-
> Explanation 3.--Where, before the date of acquisition by the assessee, the
> assets were at any time used by any other person for the purposes of his
> business or profession and the [Assessing] Officer is satisfied that the
> main purpose of the transfer of such assets, directly or indirectly to the
> assessee, was the reduction of a liability to income-tax (by claiming
> depreciation with reference to an enhanced cost), the actual cost to the
> assessee shall be such an amount as the [Assessing] Officer may, with the
> previous approval of the [Joint Commissioner], determine having regard to
> all the circumstances of the case."
The CIT(A) found that independent valuations of EDP divisions have been
carried out and the AO has not pinpointed any specific defect in the valuation
of assets of EDP division. He was of the view that the AO has not established
that the main purpose of the transfer of EDP division directly or indirectly
to the appellant, was reduction of liability of income-tax by claiming
depreciation with reference to an enhanced cost. He also noticed that the
Assessee was getting Rs. 30.00 lacs per month from M/s. Mukund Ltd. for
rendering the services of EDP division and total receipts till July, 2004
amounted to Rs. 13.80 crores. In the light of the above findings as he
considered the claim for depreciation made by the Assessee:

NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) I. EDP
Equipments including furniture and fixture: As regards to the assets of the
EDP division referred to in the order of the AO and valued at Rs./2.50 crores
by the Assessee on which it claimed depreciation, the CIT(A) was of the view
that the Assessee company has assigned the value of these assets as Rs. 2.50
crores in its books of account. The valuation was based on the itemized
valuation of each and every asset. He held that these assets are "tangible
assets", which are entitled for depreciation u/s. 32 of the Income-tax Act. He
found that these assets have been transferred to the assessee by M/s. Mukund
Ltd. He held that the WDV of these assets, as standing in the books of M/s.
Mukund Ltd. does not represent the market value of these assets. The actual
market value of these assets have been determined and assigned at Rs. 2.50
crores in the books of Assessee. He held that the AO has not pin pointed any
specific defect in the valuation of these tangible assets. In view of the
above, he directed the AO to consider the value of these assets at Rs. 2.50
crores and allow depreciation of the same in accordance with law.
II. Application and Systems Software: As regard to the technology application
software, the CIT(A) found that a value of Rs. 5 crores had been assigned to
these item of assets. The items have been specified at Annexure IV of the
agreement dated 30/09/2000. He held that these assets were in 27 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) the nature of '
intangible assets', i.e. in the nature of rights, which appellant got due to
acquisition of EDP division. The intangible assets i.e. rights are required to
be assigned some value at the time of acquisition of EDP division. These
assets includes the following:
> "Application software.
> Enterprises Resource Planning (ERP) JD Edwards Worldsoft 7.3 cum.
> *Manufacturing, Distribution & finance modules. *60 concurrent users.
> The application software considered in the officer.
> *Customised JD Edwards ERP software.
> *Purchase Stores.
> *Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, General Ledger *Other Platforms
> *Payrolls,Personnel, Provident Fund.
> *Share Accounting-Normal/Demat NSDL/CDSL, Fixed deposits.
> *Marketing, Despatch, Excise.
> *Attendance Recording.
> *PPC Maintenance.
> *Finished Goods Inventory, Finished Goods warehouse.
> *Quality Control, Off-loading *Marketing, Despatch and stock systems at
> stockyards.
> *Computer Aided designs of products"
The CIT(A) found that in the assessment order the AO has also mentioned that
softwares are not freely tradeable in the open market and are normally
patented. He found that, the software mentioned above are used exclusively 28
ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) on a particular
system where it was installed. Those system were itself transferred to the
Assessee. He also found that Assessee was earning income, due to acquisition
of these "intangible assets", in the form of technology and application
software. The assessee was getting Rs. 30.00 lacs per month from M/s. Mukund
Ltd. as a result of providing services of EDP division. He was of the view
that without these rights i.e. in software, the assessee could not operate the
hardware and the work of data processing could not be carried out. The fact
that value of these "intangible assets" in the books of M/s. Mukund Ltd. was
"NIL" in his opinion was of no consequence. He also held that when the entire
EDP division is transferred, then all tangible and intangible assets are
required to be assigned some value. According to him the assignment of value
to such intangible rights was considered further justified, as assessee was
earning income by use of these softwares. He held that the value of Rs. 5
crores earmarked to the software which in fact is a price paid for using the
software, which is installed in the system. In view of the above, the CIT(A)
directed the AO to allow depreciation on the computer software @ 60% as
claimed in the return. III. Intellectual property rights: The assessee has
also accounted for Rs. 5.20 croes in its books of accounts as value of the IPR
which it received from M/s. Mukund Ltd. The rights mentioned therein are
technical skills of 29 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) operation, maintenance of hardware and software.
The CIT(A) held that such Intellectual Property Rights(IPR) does not quality
for depreciation u/s. 32 of the I.T. Act. According to him under the Act such
rights and its depreciable character are not recognized. In his opinion, over
the years, such IPRs appreciates. In view of the above, the CIT(A) held that
the amount of Rs. 5.20 crores, assigned as the value of he IPR acquired from
M/s. Mukund Ltd. would not be entitled for any depreciation.
16\. Aggrieved by the relief allowed by the CIT(A), the revenue has raised
Ground No.2 in its appeal. Aggrieved by the order of CIT(A) sustaining
disallowance of depreciation on Intellectual Property Rights(IPR) the assessee
is in appeal before the Tribunal.
17\. We have heard the rival submissions. We shall take up for consideration
ground No.2 raised by the revenue in its appeal. As far as aforesaid ground of
appeal of the revenue is concerned the ld. D.R relied on the order of the
Assessing Officer. The ld. Counsel for the assessee reiterated the submissions
as were made before the CIT(A). He drew our attention to the order of the
Assessing Officer, wherein the Assessing Officer has referred to the fact that
the assets of the EDP Division were valued by the external valuer at Rs. 45.00
lacs while determining the valuation by 30 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02)
ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) following net assets valuing method. In this
regard he drew our attention to the report of Mr.D.K. Nagarseth, an external
valuer appointed for the purpose of valuation of EDP Equipments. A copy of
which is at page 28 to 36 of the assessee's paper book. He pointed out that as
far as the value of the assets of the EDP Division is concerned the value has
been arrived at a sum of Rs. 2,47,93,000/-. He pointed out that this valuation
is based on individualized items. He reiterated the fact that the Assessing
Officer did not dispute this valuation. The aforesaid valuation is being the
market value as on the date of transfer was rightly adopted by assessee as
actual cost for the purpose of claiming depreciation. With regard to the
disallowance of depreciation on application of software system he relied on
the order of the CIT(A).
18\. We have considered the rivals submissions. In our view the order of the
CIT(A) on this issue deserves to be upheld. As far as the disallowance of
depreciation on EDP Equipment including furniture and fixtures is concerned
the main objection of the Assessing Officer appears to be that WDV of these
assets as per the books of Mukund Ltd. should have been adopted as actual cost
by the assessee while claiming depreciation. One of the reasons assigned by
the Assessing Officer is that these assets were purchased by Mukund Ltd. under
a lease and hire purchase agreement and 31 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02)
ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) the value as per this agreement should hold good
for all purposes. In our view this was not the proper approach. The value
adopted by the assessee is duly supported by the report of a valuer, who has
certified that the value adopted by the assessee is the market value of the
assets on the date of transfer. This valuation has not been found to be
incorrect by the Assessing Officer. Besides the above, as far as the assessee
is concerned, it was justified in adopting the value it paid for acquiring
these assets from Mukund Limited because that was the actual cost which it had
paid for acquiring these assets. The action of the assessee is in accordance
with the provisions of section 43(1) of the Act. The Assessing Officer could
have made out the case by invoking Explanation-3 to section 43(1) of the Act
which he had not done. In these circumstances we are of the view that the
CIT(A) was right in directing the Assessing Officer to allow depreciation on
EDP Equipment including furniture and fixtures as claimed by the assessee.
19\. As far as depreciation on application and system software is concerned we
are of the view that the fact that the ERP package was licensed for used by
Mukund Limited cannot be the reason to hold that the assessee is not a
licensed user of the said software on which depreciation can be allowed. The
assessee by paying a sum of Rs. 5 crores for acquiring the right to use ERP
package has used the said license and earned income. The said income was 32
ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) offered to tax
by the assessee. But for the license to use ERP software the assessee would
not have earned this income. The fact that these software were used by Mukund
Limited and because of claim of depreciation over the year, their book value
was nil as per the books of Mukund Limited, cannot be the reason to hold that
the right acquired by the assessee to use these ERP package has no value. In
our view the CIT(A) was, therefore, right in directing the Assessing Officer
to allow depreciation on the value of the application and system software as
claimed by the assessee. For the reasons stated above the ground No.2 raised
by the revenue is dismissed.
20\. We shall now take up for consideration the Ground No.4 raised by the
assessee in its appeal. As far as the claim of the assessee for depreciation
on IPR is concerned the ld. Counsel for the assessee reiterated the stand of
the assessee on this issue as was made before the revenue authorities. His
alternative claim was that the said expenditure had to be allowed as revenue
expenditure and in this regard relied on the decision of the Hon'ble ITAT,
Bangalore Bench in the case of IBM Global Services India Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT,
114 ITD 264(Bang). The ld. D.R relied on the order of the Assessing Officer.
21\. We have considered the rival submissions. As far as the claim of the
assessee that depreciation has to be allowed on the IPR we are of the view 33
ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) that the claim
cannot be accepted. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the right
which the assessee acquired could be considered as a business or commercial
right as laid down u/s. 32(1)(ii) of the Act. In our view the reasons given by
the Assessing Officer for rejecting this claim are proper and calls for no
interference. As far as alternative claim of the assessee is concerned we find
that facts in the case before the Bangalore Bench of the ITAT in the case of
IBM Global Services India Pvt. Ltd.(supra) were the assessee-company in that
case was incorporated during the financial year 1997-98. Originally, there was
a company jointly promoted by Tata and IBM, which were known as Tata-IBM.
During the financial year 1997-98, it was mutually agreed between the two
promoters to bifurcate the business activities into separate entities viz. IBM
Global Services India Private Limited (the assessee-company) and Tata-IBM. As
per the agreement entered into, various assets of the erstwhile Tata-IBM were
transferred to the assessee-company for a certain consideration. As mutually
agreed, the assessee-company has paid amounts of Rs. 9,38,57,925 and Rs. 5.3
crores on account of transfer of certain employees to the assessee-company and
on account of transfer of the data base of the domestic business. The
assessee- company actually paid a sum of Rs. 18.4 crores for the transfer of
the employees to the assessee-company but claimed an expenditure of Rs.
9,38,57,925 as the remaining sum of around Rs. 9.01 crores was 34 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) attributable to
STP Unit, income of which was exempt. No report of valuer was filed to justify
the valuation attributed to the personnel transferred from Tata-IBM to the
assessee-company. The Assessing Officer felt that the methodology followed by
the assessee indicates that a sum of Rs. 5.24 crore was considered as
expenditure incurred by Tata-IBM towards training- related expenses of the
transferred employees. Salaries paid for the transferred employees for a
period of six months by Tata-IBM during the period of their services with
Tata-IBM was also added to arrive at the valuation of the employees
transferred. Before the Assessing Officer, it was submitted that such
expenditure was incurred in getting the trained and skilled employees from
Tata-IBM. Thus, the assessee-company was not required to incur any expenditure
on recruitment and training of the employees. It was argued that the
expenditure incurred is towards revenue field. The Assessing Officer concluded
that the working lacks objective and rational basis. The employees transferred
to the assessee-company are to be considered as valuable asset, which would
give an enduring advantage to the company over a long period of time. In case
such employees are not viewed as valuable asset, there would not have been any
necessity to pay such huge compensation towards an arrangement of their
transfer to the assessee- company. Actually business run by Tata-IBM has been
bifurcated and part of the business activities have been taken over by the
assessee. The business 35 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) activity, which has been taken over by the
assessee-company, is having high revenue earning potential and, therefore, the
payments are in the nature of premium for taking over the software business
segments of the erstwhile Tata-IBM. The AO held that the transaction has not
been presented in true perspective but has been camouflaged to gain an
advantage by claiming it as revenue expenditure. The Assessing Officer,
therefore, treated the compensation paid by the assessee-company to Tata-IBM
towards the so called transfer of human skills and the so called customer
database as part and parcel of overall consideration mutually agreed to the
taking over of the software segment of the business of the erstwhile Tata-IBM.
The Assessing Officer, therefore, disallowed the expenditure claimed as
revenue. The Tribunal on the above issue found that the agreement between the
parties at the time of segregation of business contained the following terms:
> "1. Tata IBM agreed to do the following :-
> (a) Sell all maintenance spares and accessories comprising inventory of Tata
> IBM relating to IBM computers;
> (b) Facilitate transfer of its personnel of Tata IBM set out in Annexure I;
> and
> (c) Share the database relating to Tata IBM's clients and customers, list

Thereafter the Tribunal held as follows:
> "In respect of payment made for transfer of human skill, it is clear that
> the expenditure has been incurred to save the expenses on training 37 ITA
> NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
> NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) and on
> recruitment. Such expenses were under revenue field and, therefore, payments
> have been made to save such revenue expenses.
The payments have been made as per the agreement. In case the transaction is
in accordance with some deed, then proper construction of the deed is
necessary to see the allowability of the expenses. The true nature of the
transaction is to be collected from the entire document. As per clause
C(3)(d), the assessee-company agreed to give due credit to all the transferred
personnel who have opted for employment with IBM Global for their past
services in Tata-IBM. Such employees rendered services to the Tata-IBM and the
amounts, if any, which were to be paid to such employees for rendering
services to Tata-IBM, were agreed to be paid by the assessee. Such expenditure
cannot be termed as an expenditure laid for carrying on the business. The
advantages were obtained by Tata-IBM as services were rendered by those
employees to Tata-IBM. It is not the case of the assessee that as and when
such employees will leave the assessee-company, the assessee will not claim
expenditure in respect of payments made to such employees after considering
the credit of services given by such employees to Tata-IBM. The Assessing
Officer has mentioned that for valuing the amount paid for transfer of human
skills, salary of six months paid by Tata-IBM has been added for arriving at
the valuation of the employees transferred. Though it is not clear from the
order that such quantum was attributable in respect of the credit to be given
for the past services rendered to Tata-IBM by the employees transferred to the
assessee-company. However, it is held that the expenditure included in the
valuation of transfer of human skills and representing the credit to be given
to the transferred employees in respect of their services to Tata-IBM, is not
allow-able, as the same expenditure will be claimed by the assessee-company as
and when such employees leave their organization. The assessee cannot be
allowed double benefit of such expenditure. The Assessing Officer will
determine the amount representing the cost to the assessee in respect of
credit to be given to these employees in respect of services rendered to Tata-
IBM. The balance expenditure is held as allowable as it has been incurred by
the assessee-company to free itself in making recurring revenue expenditure.
The amount so disallowed will not be entitled to depreciation as it does not
result into an intangible asset entitled for depreciation."

22\. As can be seen from the facts of the above case, it was a case of one
unit which was split into two units and personnel of the erstwhile single unit
became employees of one of the two split units. In the present case we find
that under Clause-3 of the agreement, Mukund Limited has agreed to provide
skills required for operation and maintenance of the hardware and software
within 30 days from the date of the agreement. Such skills have to be provided
on cost i.e. to say on the basis of no profit or no loss. It is significant to
note that the assessee as a matter of right could not compel the employees of
Mukund Limited to render services to them. In the case of IBM Global Services
India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) the agreement specifically provided that the employees
will give consent for serving in the transferee company. Further it was also
agreed that the transferee will give due credit to the transferred personnel
for benefits for past services rendered to the transferor. It was in those
circumstances that the expenditure was considered as revenue expenditure. In
the aforesaid decision the Tribunal also made it clear that the expenditure
included in the valuation of transfer of human skills and representing the
credit to be given to the transferred employees in respect of their services
to Tata-IBM, is not allow-able, as the same expenditure will be claimed by the
assessee-company as and when 39 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) such employees leave their organization. The
Assessing Officer was directed to determine the amount representing the cost
to the assessee in respect of credit to be given to these employees in respect
of services rendered to Tata- IBM. The balance expenditure was held as
allowable as it has been incurred by the assessee-company to free itself in
making recurring revenue expenditure. The amount disallowed was also held to
be not entitled to depreciation as it does not result into an intangible asset
entitled for depreciation. In the present case we find that there are no terms
agreed between the parties as was the facts in the case of IBM Global Services
India Pvt. Ltd.(supra). The Assessing Officer in the order of assessment has
clearly brought out the fact that the assessee did not have any right to call
upon the employees of Mukund Limited to render services to them. We are,
therefore, of the view that the claim for deduction for the aforesaid
expenditure as a revenue expenditure cannot be allowed. The cost paid by the
Assessee was part of acquiring the EDP division which by its very nature was
capital expenditure. The benefit of getting skilled employees is an associated
benefits from such acquisition and any cost attributed to the same will have
to be necessarily considered as capital expenditure. For the reasons given
above, Ground No.4 of the assessee is dismissed.

23\. Ground No.5 was not pressed and the same is dismissed as not pressed.
24\. Ground No.6 raised by the assessee reads as follows:
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> assessing office in levying interest under section 234D amounting to Rs.
> 16,70,807/- and ignoring the fact that the major portion of the refund on

25\. An amount of Rs. 1,95,21,537/- was refunded to the assessee vide the
following refund orders.
                           Date                      Amount (Rs.)

The said refund comprised of prepaid taxes amounting to Rs. 1,66,54,765/- and
interest thereon under section 244A amounting to Rs. 28,66,772/-. In the order
passed under section 143(3) of the Act, interest under section 234D amounting
to Rs. 16,70,807/- was been levied.
26\. Sub-section (1) of Section 234D enjoins that where any refund is granted
to the assessee under sub-section (1) of Section 143 and no refund 41 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA

regular assessment or the amount refunded under sub-section (1) of Section 143
exceeds the amount refundable on regular assessment, then the assessee shall
be liable to pay simple interest at the given rate, on the whole or the excess
amount so refunded for every month or part of a month comprised in the period
from the date of grant of refund to the date of such regular assessment. Sub-
section (2) provides that where as a result of an order under section 154 or
section 155 or section 250 or section 254 or section 260 or section 262 or
section 263 or section 264 or an order of the Settlement Commission under sub-
section (4) of section 245D of Income-tax Act, the amount of refund granted
under sub-section (1) of section 143 is held to be correctly allowed, either
in whole or in part, as the case may be, then, the interest chargeable, if any
under sub-section (1) shall be reduced accordingly. According to the
Explanation, an assessment made for the first time under section 147 or
section 153A shall be regarded as a regular assessment for the purpose of this
section.
27\. The AO levied interest u/s.143(3) of the Act consequent to the regular
assessment. The legality of the same is in challenge before the Tribunal.
Recently, the Special Bench of the Delhi Tribunal, in the ITO New Delhi vs
Ekta Promoters Pvt Ltd (ITA Nos 2551, 2552 and 2553/Del/2006 dated July 42 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA

had to consider whether the levy of interest under Section 234D of the Act
from June 1, 2003, will have retrospective application.
28\. The Bench reasoned that "there is no dispute to the proposition that a
court cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and
unambiguous. A statute is the edict of the legislature. The language employed
in a statute is determinative of the legislative intent and according to the
first and primary rule of construction, the intention of the legislation must
be found in the words used by the legislature itself and the function of the
court is only to interpret the law and the court cannot legislate. If a
provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of the process of law,
it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.

Accordingly, the Special Bench held that the levy on interest under Section
234D of the Act can only be prospective i.e., from AY 2004-05 onwards. The
Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Kerala Chemicals & 43 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA

233 ITR 584 (Ker) has taken the view that interest u/s.234-D is chargeable
from 1-6-2003 till completion of regular assessment where the refund is
granted prior to 1-6-2003 while sending intimation u/s.143(1) and regular
assessment was completed converting the refund into demand of tax. The Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in the case of Bajaj Hindustan Ltd. ITA No.198 of 2009
(order dated 15.4.2009) dealt with the following question of law: "Whether in
the facts and circumstances of the case and in law the ITAT was right in
holding that the interest u/s.234D cannot be charged in respect of refunds
granted prior to 1-6-2003"?. The Court answered the question as follows:
> " 5. So far as the last question is concerned, it is seen that the subject
> provision came on the statute book w.e.f.1-6-2003. If that be so, the said
> provision does not have retrospective effect. In this view of the matter, we
> do not see appeal giving rise to any substantial question of law. Appeal is,
> therefore, dismissed in limine with no order as to costs."
In view of the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court, which is
the jurisdictional High Court, we are of the view that in respect of refund
granted prior to 1-6-2003, the provisions of Sec.234-D cannot be applied. We
hold accordingly. In respect of refund granted after 1-6-2003, we find the
decision of the Special Bench of ITAT in the case of Ekta Promoters (supra0
has held that the provisions can be applied only for and from AY 04-05. The
Hon'ble Kerala High Court has however held that from 1-6-2003 interest 44 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) u/s.234-D is
chargeable from the date of refund till date of regular assessment where the
refund was granted prior to 1-6-2003. By implication, the Hon'ble Bombay High
Court has held that in respect of refunds granted after 1-6-2003, provisions
of Sec.234-D will apply and interest has to be charged from the date of refund
till making of regular assessment. We accordingly hold that in respect of
refund granted after 1-6-2003, interest u/s.234-D can be levied from the date
of refund till making of regular assessment. Thus Ground No.6 is partly
allowed.
29\. Ground No.7 raised by the assessee reads as follows.:
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in not giving any finding in
> respect of ground relating to short granting of credit in respect of tax
> deducted at source to the extent of Rs.6,82,924/-."
30\. We deem it appropriate to direct the AO to grant credit in respect of tax
deducted at source after verification on the basis of certificate filed.
31\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
32\. As far as the appeal of the revenue is concerned Ground No.1 raised by
the revenues reads as follows:
> "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case as well as in law, the
> Learned CIT(A) has erred in deleting disallowance of liaisoning expenses of
> Rs. 3,72,000 paid to the sister concern namely M/s.

> for liaisoning work done at Delhi, Calcutta and Chennai without appreciating
> the fact that no documentary evidence in support of these expenses except
> filing of Xerox copies of self made debit notes were furnished before the
> Assessing Officer."
33\. The assessee debited a sum of Rs.3,72,000/- under the head liaisoning
expenses. The assessee explained that the aforesaid sum was paid to M/s.
Mukund Ltd. for liaisoning work done by them at their branch office at Delhi,
Chennai and Calcutta. The assessee furnished the debit note in respect of the
aforesaid expenses which showed the description "being liaison work done on
behalf of the assessee relating to customers and government authorities".
According to the Assessing Officer the debit notes were self made and the
assessee did not furnish supporting bills to show to whom the sum has been
paid and the nature of services rendered. The Assessing Officer, therefore,
disallowed the claim for deduction of the aforesaid sum.
34\. Before the CIT(A) the assessee submitted that the expenditure on this
score was incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business since
the assessee did not have offices at Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta and he
liaison work with government department was handled by M/s. Mukund Ltd. since
it had a full-fledged branch at the said places. The projects executed by the
assessee at the said places and income arising therefrom in A.Y 2001-

The Assessee submitted that the evidences in support of the claim were
furnished before the AO during the assessment proceedings.
35\. The CIT(A) was of the view that the assessee established the identity of
the payee and the purpose of the payment and, therefore, directed the
Assessing Officer to allow the claim for deduction.
36\. Before us the ld. D.R submitted that the evidence filed by the assessee
did not establish the nature of services rendered by the assessee for which
payments for liaisoning charges were made.
47 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA

37\. Ld. Counsel for the assessee relied on the order of the CIT(A) and the
documents filed before the Assessing Officer.
38\. We have considered the rival submissions. From page 53 to 56 of the
assessee's paper book we find that there are four debit notes raised by Mukund
Ltd. claiming liaisoning expenses. These debit notes only give a description
that it was being raised for liaisoning work done by Mukund Ltd. in relation
to customers and government authorities. From the details of the contracts in
respect of which the liaisoning work was done by Mukund Ltd. it is seen that
they were mainly government agencies. It is the plea of the assessee that
since Mukund Ltd. had full fledged office at Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta and
since assessee did not have branchy office at these places, but were carrying
on number of projects, they utilized the services of Mukund Ltd. We do not
find any details of the nature of liaisoning services rendered. We are of the
view that the evidence furnished by the assessee did not establish the purpose
for which the payments were made by the assessee. What was the nature of
services rendered is also not clear. The claim by the Assessee that the
payment was for liaisoning services will not in our opinion be sufficient to
allow the deduction. In that view of the matter we set aside the order of
CIT(A) and restore the order of the Assessing Officer. Ground No.1 raised by
the revenue is allowed.

39\. Ground No.2 raised by the revenue has already been adjudicated while
deciding the appeal of the assessee. For the reasons stated therein Ground
No.2 of the revenue is dismissed.
40\. Ground No.3 raised by the revenue reads as follows.
> "3, On the facts and in the circumstances of the case as well as in law, the
> Learned CIT(A) has erred in directing to delete the disallowance of

> that assessee did not file the detailed working of the deduction claimed
> u/s. 35D in the Return of Income or during the course of assessment
> proceedings.
41\. Under section 35D the assessee is entitled to the deduction of 1/10th of
expenditure for a period of 10 years, which is incurred for setting up new
industrial undertaking. The over all ceiling limited for the expenditure to be
allowed as a deduction u/s. 35D is 2.5% of the cost of the project or capital
employed, at the option of the assessee. The assessee claimed a deduction of
Rs. 11,48,000/- u/s. 35D of the Act. According to the Assessing Officer the
assessee did not file the required calculation to find out the limit of 2.5%
of the cost of the project or capital employed. The assessee submitted before
the Assessing Officer that right from the assessment year 1995-96 the assessee
had been claiming deduction u/s.35D of the Act and has been allowed the
deduction. In 1995-96 the assessee had made a right issue of 49 ITA

incurred an expenditure of Rs.11,61,848/- in connection with the same for
which deduction u/s. 35D was allowed. In A.Y 1997-98 the assessee came out
with public issue of shares for expansion of its undertaking and has claimed
deduction u/s. 35D of the Act on such expenses. The assessee also submitted
that 2.5% of the capital employed in respect of public issue in A.Y 1997-98
would come to Rs. 36 lacs. The assessee thus submitted that the deduction
claimed should be allowed.
42\. The CIT(A) held as follows.
> "6.2 I have considered the submissions of the appellant company. I find that
> the AO has disallowed the deduction u/s. 35D for the obvious reason that
> capital employed and the borrowings upto A.Y 1997-98 works out to Rs. 1449

> allow the same in accordance with restrictions specified under section 35D
> (3) of the I.T. Act. This ground is partly allowed."
43\. Before us ld. D.R submitted that the neither the Assessing Officer nor
the CIT(A) have verified the over all ceiling limit contemplated u/s. 35D of
the Act. We are of the view that this is a matter which requires verification.
The Assessing Officer will verify as to whether the deduction claimed is
within the over all ceiling limit of 2.5% of the cost of the project or
capital employed after giving the assessee opportunity of being heard.

44\. In the result, the appeal field by the revenue is partly allowed. ITA
No.1081/M/06 & ITA No.1215/M/06 (For A.Y. 02-03)
45\. ITA No.1081/M/06 is an appeal by the assessee while ITA No.1215/M/06 is
an appeal by the revenue. Both these appeals are directed against the order
dated 17/11/2005 of CIT(A) X, Mumbai relating to A.Y 2002-03. First we take up
for consideration of filed by the assessee.
46\. Ground No.1 & 2 raised by the assessee read as follows:
> "1.On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> Assessing Officer in making an addition under section 36(1)(va) read with
> section 2(24)(x) of Rs.2,61,387/- in respect of employees contribution to

47\. These grounds are identical to Ground No.1 to 3 raised by the assessee in
ITA No. 1905/M/05 for A.Y 2001-02. For the reasons stated 51 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) therein these
grounds of appeals are allowed and the Assessing Officer is directed to
allowed the deduction claimed by the assessee.
48\. Ground No.3 raised by the assessee reads as follows:
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in not directing to allow
> depreciation on the opening written down value of various blocks of assets
> as finally determined in the appellate order for earlier year."
49\. This issue relates to the depreciation claimed by assessee in A.Y 2001-
02 on the various assets which were acquired in the process of purchase of the
EDP division of Mukund Ltd. Since the issue with regard to depreciation has
already been decided by us in A.Y 2001-02 the Assessing Officer is directed to
give effect to the same and consequently work out the opening WDV of various
blocks of assets and allow depreciation in accordance with law.
50\. Ground No.4 raised by the assessee reads as follows:
> "4. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) erred in upholding the action of the
> Assessing Officer in not granting deduction in respect of prior period
> expenses amounting to Rs. 40,51,722/- being the expenses debited in the
> Profit and Loss account of the previous year relevant to the above
> assessment year."
51\. On going through the Annexure XXI to Tax Audit Report it was seen by the
AO that a sum of Rs. 40,51,722 has been shown as prior period 52 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) expenses debited
to profit. The assessee was asked to show cause as to why prior period
expenses should not be disallowed as the method of accounting followed by the
assessee company was mercantile system of accounting. In reply, the assessee
filed a letter dated 4.2.2005 stating as under:-
> "In Annexure XXI, of the Tax Audit report for assessment year 2003- 04,
> amounts of Rs. 99512958 and Rs. 1049875 has been shown as prior period

> expenses should be allowed as a deduction in assessment year 2003-04 being

The submission of the assessee was considered but rejected by the AO.
According to the AO, the assessee company was following mercantile system of
accounting and therefore the expenses of prior period amounting to Rs.
40,51,722/- was disallowed and added to the total income of the assessee. The
AO also held that the claim of adjustment of prior period expenses debited in
the previous year relevant to the assessment year 2003-04 will be considered
during the course of assessment for assessment year 2003-04.

52\. The findings of the CIT(A) on the issue were as under:-
> "During the appellate proceedings it has been submitted that as the AO had
> not allowed such expenses in earlier assessment year it should be allowed
> the expenses to be deducted for the year under consideration. The appellant

53\. Before us ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee
offered prior period income to tax in this year which was duly taxed by the AO
but when it comes to allowing deduction of prior period expenses the 54 ITA
NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA
NO.1810/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1215/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) Assessing
Officer took a stand that the expenses relate to the earlier period. It was
also submitted by him that the issue is recurring issue in each year and the
revenue should follow a uniform practice. If prior period expenses are claimed
in 2001-02 the revenue should not take a stand that the same can be allowed
only in the year of crystallization and when it is claimed in the year of
crystalisation they should not take a stand that they should be claimed in the
year in which they are accounted in the books. The ld. Counsel for the
assessee submitted that the assessee is willing to produce all vouchers and
the deduction should be allowed in the year of crystallization. In this regard
ld. Counsel for the assessee filed before us a copy of the decision of the
ITAT Mumbai Bench in the case of M/s. Excel Industries Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA
No.5630/M/91 for A.Y 1987-88 and Toyo Engineering India Ltd. vs. JCIT (2006) 5
SOT 616(Mum). In the aforesaid cases on identical facts, as that of the
assessee in this appeal, the Tribunal has taken the view that fair
determination of tax liability of an assessee should be made adopting the
reasonable approach.
54\. The Ld. D.R on the other hand, relied on the order of the revenue
authorities.
55 ITA NO.1905/MUM/05(A.Y. 2001-02) ITA NO.1081/MUM/06(A.Y. 2002-03) ) ITA

55\. After considering the rival submissions we are of the view that it would
just and proper to remand the issue back to Assessing Officer for fresh
consideration. The assessee will produce for examination by the Assessing
Officer all the bills and vouchers in respect of expenses. The Assessing
Officer will examine the same and allow it in the year in which the expenses
crystallized or accrued. The above directions in our view will meet the ends
of justice as the assessee has to get deduction in one of the assessment
years.
56\. In the result, appeal by the assessee is partly allowed. ITA
NO.1215/MUM/06 - REVENUE'S APPEAL
