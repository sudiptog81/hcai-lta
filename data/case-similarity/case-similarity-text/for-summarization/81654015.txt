                        We do not consider it necessary to examine
                        whether the allegations made by the CBI and the
                        State of Bihar against each other are true. That
                        would involve undertaking a needlessly protracted

                        to the overall picture, which emerges out of the
                        rival pleadings of the CBI, and the State of Bihar
                        we are of the opinion that it is in the interest of
                        justice to transfer the case from the State of Bihar
                        to Delhi.
                        We       accordingly   direct   that   the   committal

                        within four weeks of the date of receipt of record
                        by him. If and after the proceedings are committed
                        to the Court of Sessions, the trial of the case shall
                        be held in Delhi. We direct in that behalf that the
                        case shall be tried by a Sessions Judge or
                        Additional Sessions Judge to be nominated by the
                        Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.
                        We would like to make it clear that the fact that we
                        are transferring the case from Bihar to Delhi does
                        not mean and ought not to be construed to mean

    4.        On 02.01.1975, the then Railway Minister late Lalit Narain
    Mishra arrived at Samastipur Railway Station, Bihar to inaugurate the
    opening of a Board Gauge Railway Line from Samastipur to
    Muzaffarpur. In the evening as soon as Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra
    finished his speech and was to step down from the Dais, accused
    Sudevanand threw a hand grenade, which exploded. This resulted into
    death of Lalit Narain Mishra, Surya Narain Jha MLC (Bihar) and Ram

                                     1) Factual Matrix
    5.        The factual matrix of the prosecution case is that one Prabhat
    Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti @ Baba, the then employee of
    Jamalpur Workshop, Eastern Railway, founded Anand Marg
    CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.                                        Vinod Goel

     Parcharak Sangh on 09.01.1955. The followers of Anand Marg
    regarded him as incarnation of God like Shiva and Krishna. The object
    of the Anand Marg was to establish 'Sadvipra Raj', a government of
    moralists. In order to achieve this, a cadre of full time workers known
    as Avadhoots was created by Anand Murti. He also formed several
    wings of the cult including Vishwa Shanti Sena (VSS) and the workers
    of this organization were trained in use of arms with a view to
    establish Sadvipra Raj by use of force, if necessary. Prabhat Ranjan
    Sarkar @ Anand Murti was arrested on 29.12.1971 at Patna on the
    charge of criminal conspiracy to annihilate such followers who had
    defected from the organization. He was prosecuted along with other
    accused on the charges of murder, conspiracy etc. in the Court of
    Sessions at Patna. When Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti could
    not secure his release in accordance with law, a false propaganda was
    set afoot that he was being maltreated in jail, and to compel the
    government for his release, two Anand Margies Divyanand and
    Dineshwaranand committed self-immolation at Patna and Delhi
    respectively in 1973. Messages purported to have been sent by P.R.
    Sarkar from jail exhorted his followers to prove their bravery by
    bringing him out of jail and not to rest until they kill their enemies.
    Demonstrations and gheroas were organized for release of Prabhat
    Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti. Having failed under law, a
    Revolutionary Group was formed around July 1973 at Patna. This
    group        was       joined    by   accused   Vinayanand   (P.O.),   accused

     Visheshwaranand (approver) and some others for securing his release
    by pressurizing the Government by recourse to violent acts. Accused
    Visheshwaranand                  (approver)   and   Vinayanand   (P.O.)   adopted
    pseudonyms 'Vijay' and 'Jagdish' respectively.                   With a view to
    disguise their identity, they also discarded their saffron robes, cut their
    hair, and shaved their beard. The accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand,
    Arteshanand (now deceased) and Aacharya Ram Kumar Singh (P.O.)
    joined this group. In the latter half of 1973, a secret meeting was held
    at village Trimohan, District Bhagalpur (Bihar), at the residence of
    accused Aacharya Ram Kumar Singh (P.O.). In the meeting, it was
    decided to liquidate one Madhavanand, who turned an approver in the
    case of criminal conspiracy against Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand
    Murti as the enemy no.1. Late Lalit Narain Mishra, the then Union
    Railway Minister was considered to be the enemy no.2 and Abdul
    Gaffoor, the then Chief Minister of Bihar was considered as puppet of
    late Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra also came within the purview of an
    enemy. Accused Santoshanand assigned certain specific duties
    amongst the conspirators. Accused Vinayanand @ Jagdish (P.O.) was
    to murder Madhavanand, accused Visheshwaranand @ Vijay
    (approver) was to murder Abdul Gaffoor, accused Arteshanand and
    Sudevanand were to kill other persons opposing the cult in the case
    against Anand Murti.
    6.        In order to achieve the object, accused Ram Aasrey Prasad,
    (P.O.) obtained five bombs and other accused Vinayanand,

     Visheshwaranand and Santoshanand procured arms and ammunitions
    and handed over the same to one Gopalji R/o Village Chautham (A-7
    in the charge sheet).
    7.        On 07.01.1974, an attempt was made on the life of
    Madhavanand at the Collectorate, Patna where he was brought for
    grant of pardon in the above said case where Anand Murti and others
    were accused. Proclaimed Offender Vinayanand attempted to kill the
    approver Madhavanand by throwing a live hand grenade on him but it
    did not explode. After throwing a live hand grenade on him, accused
    Vinayanand (P.O.) escaped and jumped into the River Ganga but was
    apprehended while his other companions managed to escape. A case
    no. 24 (1) 74 u/s 120-B/302/307 IPC was registered on the complaint
    of Naik Chandi Mishra at PS Kotwali, Patna. This case was later on
    transferred to C.B.I. vide RC-14/75 CIU.      In July 1974, accused
    Vikram (approver) joined the conspiracy and he brought three hand
    grenades from Delhi to Bhagalpur in a packet, given to him by the
    accused Santoshanand to be delivered to one Budheshawaranand
    Avadhoot @ Tyageshwaranand @ Amar Singh (deceased). On
    13.7.1974, Budheshawaranand was arrested at Maqbara (tomb),
    Chhotti Khanjarpur (Bhagalpur), close to Anand Marg Primary School
    at Bhagalpur for being in possession of a bag (jhola) containing three

    8.        In furtherance of conspiracy, the conspirators planned the
    murder of Late Lalit Narain Mishra, who was to arrive on 02.01.1975
    at Samastipur Railway Station for inauguration of Broad Gauge
    Railway Line from Samastipur to Muzaffarpur.            The inaugural
    function was to be held at Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway
    Station on a grand scale. Entry to this function was regulated by
    means of "passes/badges/invitation cards".
    9.        Prosecution alleges that the accused Ranjan Dwivedi (A-3),
    active member of Anand Marg, reached Samastipur on or about
    01.01.1975 by bus along with Santoshanand (A-1) and Sudevanand
    (A-2). He managed to secure passes to enable himself, A-1 and A-2 to
    gain entry to Platform No. 3. By this time, PW-2 Vikram (Approver)

23\. I have heard Ld. Special Public Prosecutor Sh. N.K. Sharma and Ld.
Defence Counsel Sh. Siddharth Luthra, Senior Advocate, Ms. Sima Gulati,
Advocate, Sh. Ashwani Kumar Bali, Amicus Curiae for accused Santoshanand, Sh.
Feroz Ahmed and Sh. R.S. Sharma, Advocates for accused Sudevanand, Ms. Sima
Gulati and Sh. Anuj Kumar, Advocates for accused Gopalji and accused Ranjan
Dwivedi in person at length. I have carefully perused the material available
on the record. Certain basic and rudimentary aspects argued by the learned
Defence Counsel which are pure questions debatable in law are being taken up
at the threshold for adjudication.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 110
6) Defect in charge- effect
24\. It is argued by ld. Defence Counsel that as per the case of prosecution,
Vinayanand, Arteshanand and Ram Kumar have not participated in the crime at
Samastipur on 02.01.1975 and only the accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram
Janam Dwivedi and Vikram approver have participated there. However, they
pointed out that while framing the charges under Sections 120-B & 302 IPC with
regard to the incident dated 2.1.1975 for throwing hand grenade on the Dais at
Platform No.3, Samastipur Railway Station to kill L.N. Mishra the names of
Vinayanand, Arteshanand and Ram Kumar are also mentioned to suggest that their
participation in the said crime. Nevertheless, there is no force in the
arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel as admittedly, it is nowhere the case of the
prosecution that Vinayanand, Arteshanand and Ram Kumar have participated in
the crime dated 02.01.1975 along with Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam
Dwivedi and approver Vikram. This is mentioned neither in the charge sheet nor
in the order dated 21.01.1981 by which the point of charge was decided by my
Learned Predecessor. The Ld. Defence Counsel merely pointed out the defect in
the charge framed against the accused persons during the course of their
respective arguments; they did not submit how this prejudiced their defence or
the course of trial. The law governing the subject is that no technical
formula of words but the substance, whether the matter was explained to the
accused and whether accused understood as to what he was being tried for is to
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 111 be considered and nothing more. This is so held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhoor Singh and another. Vs. State of Punjab 1974
SCC (Crl.) 664. Further, it has also been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
K. Prema S Rao and Another Vs. Yadla Siriniwas Rao & Others 2003 (1) SCC 217
that Section 215 allows the criminal court to ignore any error in stating
either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, if
the accused was not, in fact, misled by such error or omission in framing the
charge, and it has not occasioned a failure of justice. Section 215 Cr. PC
provides that no error in stating either the offence or the particulars
required to be stated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or
those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material,
unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission and it has
occasioned a failure of justice.
25\. The information about involvement of persons namely Santoshanand,
Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Vikram approver in the crime at Railway
Station, Samastipur had already been conveyed to accused persons. In the
circumstances, when the defence has failed to point out as to how the trial
has prejudiced them, this court is unable to sail with the defence that the
clerical error in the charge occasioned any failure of justice to the accused
persons in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhoor Singh &
in K. Prema S Rao (supra).

7) Clubbing of Investigations
26\. As per the case of the prosecution, on 7.1.1974 an attempt was made on
the life of Madhavanand at Collectorate, Patna regarding which an FIR No.
24/1974 (Ex.PW-92/A) was registered with PS Kotwali, Patna and when the matter
was assigned to C.B.I., they registered an FIR vide RC-14/1975. They further
submitted that regarding incident at Tomb (Maqbara), Khanjarpur dated
13.7.1974, an FIR No.71 dated 13.7.1974 was also registered with PS Kotwali,
Bhagalpur and when the matter was assigned for investigation to C.B.I., they
registered an FIR vide RC-13/1975. Regarding the incident dated 02.01.1975 at
Railway Station, Samastipur, GRP Samastipur Railway Station lodged an FIR
no.1/1975 dated 02.01.1975 and when the matter was assigned to C.B.I., they
registered an FIR vide RC-1/1975. Regarding the explosion of the hand grenade
at the house of Sh. Mahadev Sahu, an FIR no.1/75 dated 02.01.1975 was
registered with PS Samastipur, Bihar and when the matter was assigned to
C.B.I., they registered an FIR vide RC-2/1975. Regarding all these four
matters, the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a common charge sheet
before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna on 12.11.1975. It is testified
by the Investigation Officer PW- 151 H.L. Ahuja at page no. 3559 of his
statement that after discussion with the C.I.D., Bihar and local police
officers, the investigations of both these cases bearing no. RC-1/1975 &
RC-2/1975 were amalgamated on 10.1.1975 itself. At page no.3581 of his
statement, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 113 Sh. H.L. Ahuja further deposed that he received
the copies of FIRs RC-13/1975 & RC-14/1975 on 15.9.1975 at Delhi; and he
amalgamated investigations of these two FIRs with the investigation of
RC-1/1975 on 15.9.1975.
27\. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that there is no such procedure in the "Cr.
PC." authorizing an Investigating Officer to consolidate the investigation of
the cases and that too without permission of the concerned judicial
Magistrate. They argued that for this reason, the accused have been grossly
prejudiced as this illegality goes to the root of the matter; and on this
ground alone, the accused persons are liable to be acquitted. Per contra it is
submitted by the Ld. Special PP that the investigations into such inter-twined
facts, which are sequential like separate levers in the chain necessarily
makes the investigating agency to look into with a broader spectrum. It is the
case of the prosecution that pursuant to the criminal conspiracy which was
hatched at the roof of the house of Ram Kumar at village Trimohan, an attempt
was made on the life of Madhavanand who was an approver in a murder case
against Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti @ Baba, head of Anand Marg
Organization. An FIR No. 24/74 was registered with PS Kotwali Patna. It is
also the case of the prosecution that arms were got collected and some hand
grenades were being carried out from Delhi to Bhagalpur by Vikram (PW-2) on
asking of accused Santoshanand to execute the criminal conspiracy hatched at
Trimohan. As directed by Santoshanand, those hand CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 114
grenades were delivered to Budheshawaranand and they were carrying the same in
a Jhola (bag) when Budheshawaranand was apprehended at said Tomb at Khanjarpur
& Vikram ran away and an FIR No. 71 dated 13.07.1974 was registered at PS
Kotwali, Bhagalpur. In furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, a hand grenade
was thrown at the Dais of Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway Station on
02.01.1975, which led to murder of the then Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra
and two more persons, and several persons were injured. An FIR No. 1 of 1975
with PS GRP Samastipur was registered. As per the case of the prosecution, the
approver Vikram dropped the hand grenade at the railway track at Samastipur
Railway Station, which was picked up by PW-4 Rajinder Parshad Nayak, who took
it to the house, and he had shown it to his cousin PW-3 Mahinder Parshad Sahu
and the hand grenade exploded in their house. An FIR No. 1 of 1975 was
registered with PS Samastipur. All these incidents have taken place in
pursuant to deep-rooted criminal conspiracy and admittedly, there is no bar in
the Cr. PC that investigation officer cannot consolidate the investigations of
these cases and file a common charge sheet. The similar point has come up
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in C. Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu (SC) :
2010 (9) SCC 567 and relevant Para 28 of the judgment reads as under :-
> "28. The submission on behalf of the appellants that two crimes bearing Nos.
> 188 and 190 of 2000 could not be clubbed together, has also no merit CBI Vs.
> Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
> Page No. 115 for the simple reason that if the cases are considered, keeping
> in view the totality of the circumstances and the sequence in which the two
> incidents occurred, taking into consideration the evidence of drivers and
> conductors/cleaners of the vehicles involved in the first incident and the
> evidence of C. Ramasundaram V.A.O., (PW.87), we reach the inescapable
> conclusion that the second occurrence was nothing but a fall out of the
> first occurrence. The damage caused to the public transport vehicles and the
> consequential burning of the University bus remained part of one and the
> same incident. Merely because two separate complaints had been lodged, did
> not mean that they could not be clubbed together and one charge sheet could
> not be filed (See: T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala & Ors. 2001(3) R.C.R.
> (Criminal) 436 : (2001) 6 SCC 181)."
28\. Though it is not an illegality and there is no bar in the "Cr. PC" from
clubbing the investigations of the connected cases, yet it should have been
brought to the notice of the court at the initial stage of trial by the
accused persons if they felt aggrieved by the action of the investigation
officer. It is held by our own Hon'ble High Court in Dr. R.R. Kishore vs.
C.B.I. (2006) 3 JCC 1758 (Para 28 and 29) that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 116 where
cognizance is taken on the basis of an illegal investigation; no objection is
taken at the initial stage; trial proceeds to its conclusion and results in
conviction, the same can be set aside only if it has resulted in miscarriage
of justice. Relevant Para 28 and 29 reads as under:-
> "28. After examining the aforesaid decision of the Privy Council as well as
> of the Supreme Court, the following principles emerge:-
> 1\. If cognizance is taken on the basis of such an illegal investigation and
> no objection is taken at the initial stages and the trial proceeds to its
> conclusion and results in conviction then the same can be set aside only if
> it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
> 2\. However, if the illegal investigation is brought to the notice of the
> Trial Court at the initial stages then the court ought not to proceed with
> the trial and be a mute spectator to the illegality and contravention of a
> mandatory provision but should direct reinvestigation so that defect in
> investigation is cured.
29\. It follows that if, at the initial stage of trial, the illegality of
investigation is brought to the notice of the court and yet the Trial Court
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 117 continues with the trial then, such proceedings would
be liable to be set aside by the High Court in exercise of its revisional
jurisdiction........"
29\. For the foregoing reasons and the case law discussed above, the following
points emerge inexorably on record: -
                        (a)          That clubbing of investigations is not
                        specifically barred under Cr. PC;
                        (b)          That the case law recognizes the clubbing of
investigations pertaining to the same genre of events culminating into a
triable offence, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in C. Muniappan's case
(supra)
(c) It is worthwhile to note that initial meeting of mind resulting into
conspiracy hatched at the terrace of the house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan, and
deliberation, carrying of similar intentions, consensus among the parties,
their conceiving the common intention to liquidate the defector of their cult
Sh. Madhavanand, and the acts done in pursuance of achieving the goal to get
released the "Cult Head" by means unknown to law, have led the accused persons
in the overt acts of collecting the arms and ammunitions, like hand grenades,
pistols and subsequent events, like attempt on life CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 118 of
Madhavanand at Collectorate, Patna (FIR No. 24/1974, PS Kotwali, Patna) are
all sequential facts sprouting from the ill conceived intentions for which
four separate FIRs were registered. In this case, the first FIR No. 24/1974,
PS Kotwali, Patna deals with an attempt on the life of Madhavanand, the
defector of the cult, pursuant to the conspiracy in a larger goal and this
attempt on his life is the starting point of an overt act. The second FIR No.
71/1974 dated 13.07.1974, registered with PS Kotwali, Bhagalpur, pertained to
carrying of hand grenades and arms by Budheshawaranand @ Tyageshwaranand @
Amar Singh (since deceased) and Vikram @ Jaldhar Dass @ Subir (PW-2) as a
second event arising from the same conspiracy. This is further followed by the
most macabre event in which the then Union Railway Minister Late Sh. L.N.
Mishra, one MLC Sh. Surya Narain Jha and a railway clerk Sh.
Ram Kishore Singh Kishore were disincarnated and resulting into grievous
injuries to eight persons and causing hurt to 18 persons. Consequently, an FIR
No. 1/75, PS GRP, Samastipur Railway Station was lodged on 02.01.1975. The 4th
FIR CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 119 No. 1/75, PS Samastipur dealt with an explosion of a
hand grenade at the house of an innocent railway employee in the railway
colony adjoining the Railway Station, Samastipur resulting into injuries to
two siblings of the railway employees.
(d) Needless to say that as per case of prosecution, incident dated 02.01.1975
vide FIR No.1/75 PS GRP Samastipur, explosion had taken place due to the
grenade flung by A-2 in pursuance to conspiracy & another carried by PW-2
(approver), which could not be used, and dropped by him on railway track while
fleeing and A-1 could not use his grenade as one flung by A-2 exploded. These
facts cannot be looked at, investigated or understood in isolation. Hence,
from the progression of investigation conducted separately was later on
rightly felt by IO PW-151 to club them to project a wholesome picture and not
a piecemeal investigation, which would have clashed with the collection of
facts resulting into futility. Therefore, considering the progression of the
case, sequence of events for achieving the end result to put the crime into
justice, it was most expedient, warranted and wanted in the ends of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 120 justice to consolidate the investigations of all the afore said
four FIRs. Hence, I see no reason to reject the charge sheet per se on this
ground.
(e) The defence had never objected to or pointed out this defect, as now
argued by them, at the time of framing the charges. I do not see any specific
prejudice having been caused to any of the accused during the course of trial.
8) Effect of Pardon
30\. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that pardon has been granted to PW-1
Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Aacharya Madan @ Kapalic @ Aacharya Visheshwaranand @
Vijay and to PW-2 Jaldhar Dass @ Vikram @ Subir by a common order dated
27.10.1975 by the court of CJM, Patna in FIR bearing no. RC-1/1975 but they
have not been granted pardon in other three cases. It is also argued that the
accused in all four FIRs are different persons. As per the case of the
prosecution, PW-2 joined the criminal conspiracy in the year 1974 whereas the
alleged criminal conspiracy was hatched at village Trimohan in October 1973,
and this order of pardon cannot be treated for three other FIRs. For this
reason, the Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the statement of approvers PW-1
and PW-2 cannot be looked into by this court. It is to be kept in mind that
the investigating officer Sh. H.L. Ahuja has already amalgamated the
investigation of two cases of RC-1/1975 (FIR No. 1/75 dated 2.1.1975 PS GRP,
Samastipur) & RC-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 121 2/1975 (FIR No. 1/75, PS Samastipur) on 10.01.1975,
the day he took over the investigations on behalf of C.B.I. Subsequently on
15.9.1975, he amalgamated the investigation of FIRs no.RC-13/1975 (FIR No.
71/1974 PS Kotwali, Bhagalpur & RC-14/1975 (FIR No. 24/1974 Patna Kotwali)
with RC-1/1975. After amalgamation of investigation of all the four cases and
subsequent to filing of the common charge sheet, the order of pardon was
granted by Ld. CJM, Patna on 27.10.1975 and for that reason, Ld. CJM has
mentioned the number of main case RC-1/1975 in the title of its order. So,
there is no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel that statement of
approvers PW-1 and PW-2 in cases other than RC-1/1975 is not relevant.
31\. There is also no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel that Sh.
Madan Mohan Srivastava (PW-1) was arrested only in the case registered vide
FIR No. 24/1974 (RC-14/1975) and not in other 3 cases and accused Vikram
(PW-2) was not arrested in the present case. They argued that accused Vikram
(PW-2) was arrested in a case registered in New Delhi for attack on the then
CJI Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Ray and only production warrants were issued in
the case vide FIR No.1/1975 (RC-1/1975) and he was not arrested in any of
these four cases.
32\. Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava was already released on bail on 08.05.1975 in
Patna Kotwali case vide FIR No. 24/1974. On 12.05.1975, his confessional
statement was recorded u/s 164 Cr. PC.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 122 He was granted pardon on 27.10.1975 and as such there
was no occasion for the Investigation Officer to take him in custody under u/s
306 (4) (b) of Cr. PC.
33\. So far as approver Vikram is concerned, he was arrested on 24.07.1975 in
a case of attack on the then CJI Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Ray and turned
approver. Ld. Defence Counsel vehemently urged that accused Vikram was not at
all arrested in this case and order of pardon is per se void ab initio. This
court has ventured to peruse the entire old voluminous record of this case and
found that there is no force in the argument. Record reveals that during the
investigation, Sh. H. L. Ahuja moved an application in the present case before
CMM, Delhi on 12.08.1975. The accused Vikram was produced in RC-11/1975 (A.N.
Ray's case) and the court directed that he be produced before Sh. R.D.
Aggarwal IV ACMM, Delhi for necessary action. On the same day, he was produced
before the court of Sh. R.D. Aggarwal, ACMM, Delhi and accused Vikram @ Subir
@ Jaldhar Dass was remanded to judicial custody in the present case and was
directed to be produced on 14.08.1975. He was again produced before the said
court of ACMM, Delhi on 14.08.1975 at 4.30 PM and he was further remanded to
judicial custody for 2 days and directed to be produced on 16.08.1975. On
16.08.1975, he was again produced before the said court at 10:15 AM and he
expressed his desire to make confession in the present case. The court
cautioned him and gave him time to think it over. The court of ACMM, Delhi
recorded his part CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 123 statement on that day. The
statement of Vikram was completed on 18.08.1975, which is Ex.PW-2/L. This
statement of Vikram was ordered to be sent in sealed cover to Special
Magistrate (CBI) Patna. (All these proceedings are available in File No. is
R-43-5.) It is, thus, clear that before making confessional statement, the
accused Vikram was taken into custody by the court and after recording his
statement by ACMM, Delhi, he was granted pardon on 27.10.1975 by CJM, Patna.
34\. To sum up the contention of the defence to attack the order granting
pardon to PW-2 is based on the following grounds: -
(a) that grant of pardon in one case RC-1/1975 cannot be read in evidence in
other three cases.
(b) that the grant of pardon in RC-1/1975 is itself illegal as he was never
arrested prior to grant him pardon in the present case.
While dealing with the above said arguments, it is to be delineated that: -
                        (i)          the investigations of RC-1/1975 and RC-
                        2/1975          were   clubbed/amalgamated    by    the
                        Investigating Officer on 10.01.1975.
                        (ii)         the investigation of RC-13/1975 and RC-
                        14/1975 were clubbed with RC-1/1975 by the
                        Investigating Officer on 15.09.1975.
    CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.                                                  Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 124
(iii) the Judicial Record found in File No. R-43-5 dispels all the doubts as
regards the arrest of Vikram (approver). Firstly, he was arrested and produced
before the Ld. ACMM, Delhi on 12.08.1975, and later on, 16.08.1975 when he
expressed his desire to confess. Following the judicial norms in taking down
the confessional statement, the Ld. ACMM had adjourned the matter for
14.08.1975 and 16.08.1975. His confessional statement was completed on
18.08.1975.
After delineating the above said facts, it is needless to say that the order
of granting pardon to approver Vikram is fully in consonance with the
procedure laid down under Section 164 and Section 306 of the Cr. PC and this
court does not find any illegality therein. Further, the argument that the
Vikram was not arrested at all in the present case falls to the ground for the
facts mentioned hereinbefore revealed through the judicial record. The second
leg of argument that the granting of pardon in one case be not read as
evidence in other cases does not appeal to the common prudence since the
investigations of all the four FIRs mentioned hereinbefore were amalgamated by
the investigating officer. The essence of confessional statement seeking
pardon covers the entire gamut of events. Thus, this court finds no CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 125 tenable grounds to strike at the root of prosecution on the above
contentions of the defence.
9) Whether the pardon to PW-1 is tainted?
35\. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Aacharya
Visheshwaranand Avadhoot could not have been made an approver in this case as
he had filed an application for grant him bail claiming innocence on
03.05.1975 through one Sh. Radha Raman Prasad, Advocate. The Ld. Defence
Counsel pointed out that in his bail application, it is pleaded by PW-1 that
he is quite innocent and had been falsely implicated and arrested on
30.04.1975 with incorrect and baseless allegations and the court has already
granted bail to other co-accused persons. (This bail application is available
at page no.186 of Folder R-4). A perusal of the relevant record reveals that
this bail application was not signed by PW-1. It bears only signatures of his
counsel. The court of CJM, Patna granted him bail vide order dated 08.05.1975.
(This bail order is available at page no.81 of Folder R-9). In the order
granting bail, it is, inter-alia, mentioned that accused Visheshwaranand @
Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Vijay had been produced from police custody. He
submitted to the court of CJM, Patna that no ill treatment was given to him.
The investigating officer filed memo of evidence against him (PW-1) and it was
noted by the court of CJM, Patna that the main accused Vinayanand, who was
arrested at the spot, had already been CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 126 granted bail by
the Hon'ble High Court and as such, PW-1 was ordered to be bailed out by the
court of CJM, Patna.
36\. In this regard, ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate has relied
upon a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rampal Pithwa Rahidass v. State of
Maharashtra 1994 SCC (2) 685. The Ld. Defence Counsel argued that approver
must not exculpate himself from the crime and if he participates in crime,
only then he can be an approver. I have gone through the judgment in Rampal
Pithwa Rahidass (supra). The judgment relied upon by the Ld. Counsel for the
defence is distinguishable. PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava did not sign the
application filed for bail on his behalf and it is merely signed by Sh. Radha
Raman Prasad, Advocate. In his cross- examination, he has stated that the said
application was moved by his father and maternal uncle and not by him. This
application appears to have been filed before the court by the counsel Sh.
Radha Raman Prasad in a routine manner and it is drafted in a standard
formats, which is filed by any Advocate on behalf of the accused in every
criminal case. This application has been filed four days after his arrest on
03.05.1975 as he was admittedly arrested on 30.04.1975. It is common prudence
that in the anxiety to get enlarged on bail, every accused under incarceration
pleads in his bail application firstly that he is innocent and secondly he is
falsely implicated. Mere assertion as such cannot be believed as biblical
truth without trial. In the judgment Rampal Pithwa Rahidass (supra) relied
upon by the Ld. Defence CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 127 Counsel, the approver Ram Charan
was arrested on 07.07.1984 in some other case to touch a cycle parked on the
side of the road u/s 379/511 IPC and during interrogation, as per prosecution,
approver Ram Charan disclosed having participated in a decoity on a highway.
The complainant of that case u/s 379/511 IPC did not say that any attempt was
made to steal his cycle. The approver was not produced by the investigation
officer before the Magistrate to record his statement u/s 164 Cr. P.C. While
accused Ram Charan was in police custody, another accused Murari died in
police custody on 10.07.1984 and within a few days of his death, he made
confessional statement of his own. After more than 2 years of his arrest, he
submitted an application seeking bail from judicial lock-up pleading therein
that he was being forced to become an eye witness in the case though he knew
nothing about crime and the bail was declined. Suddenly, of his own on
01.04.1987, accused Ram Charan filed an application to become an approver and
to make disclosure of all the facts about which he had stated in his earlier
application dated 17.01.1987, where he pleaded that he knew nothing. Even in
his application dated 01.04.1987 he, inter-alia, stated that persons against
whom the case for dacoity and murder have been filed were responsible for
murder and that "I was only looking after their clothes". In these
circumstances, coupled with many others, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
that his testimony is not worthy of acceptance.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 128
37\. Therefore, the judgment relied upon by Ld. Defence Counsel is quite
distinguishable and not applicable to the facts of the present case. Moreover,
u/s 306 Cr. PC., an accomplice may be "any person" supposed to have been
directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence, and with a view to
obtain evidence of such person, the Magistrate may grant him pardon at any
stage of investigation or enquiry or trial, subject to his making a full and
true disclosure within his knowledge relating to the offence. At the cost of
repetition, this court is to concisely state that: -
(i) The bail application is not the conscious effort of PW-1 Madan Mohan
Srivastava @ Aacharya Visheshwaranand Avadhoot and the same cannot be the
basis for grant or refusal of pardon.
(ii) As already concluded the stereo-type language employed by an Advocate,
that too instructed by relatives of the incarcerated person who stated that
the accused is innocent cannot in my view invalidate the rights open to any
accused seeking pardon under Section 306 of the Cr. PC.
(iii) Even if bail application is taken at the face value, the mere assertion
that the applicant was innocent cannot nullify his right to invoke the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 129 protections guaranteed under Section 306 of the Cr. PC.
38\. One cannot oblivious of the ratio decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
that in the administration of criminal justice, Law of Precedents alone has no
much relevance; criminal case cannot be decided in colour of precedents unless
facts and circumstances in a cited case are in pari materia in all respects
with the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. In his regard, it has
been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Singh alias Photti v. State
of A.P. AIR 2004 SC 4545 that unless and until the facts and circumstances in
a cited case are in pari materia in all respects with the facts and
circumstances of the case in hand, it would not be proper to treat an earlier
case as a precedent to arrive at a definite conclusion. The relevant Para of
the judgment reads as under:
> "11. A reading of the above judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for
> the appellants does indicate that this Court in the said cases held that
> certain acts as found in those cases did not indicate the sharing of common
> intention. But we have to bear in mind that the facts appreciated in the
> above judgments and inference drawn have been so done by the Courts not in
> isolation but on the totality of the circumstances found in those cases. The

> circumstances in a cited case is in pari materia in all respects with the
> facts and circumstances of the case in hand, it will not be proper to treat
> an earlier case as a precedent to arrive at a definite conclusion."
39\. Similar view has been taken by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Punjab National
Bank v. R.L. Vaid and others AIR 2004 SC 4269 and relevant Para 5 reads as
under :-
> "5. .....There is always peril in treating the words of a judgment as though
> they are words in a Legislative enactment and it is to be remembered that
> judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular
> case. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may make

> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 131
40\. Same principle of law has been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Parasa Raja Manikyala Rao and another vs. State of A.P. AIR 2004 SC 132 and
relevant Para of the judgment reads as under:-
> "9. Each case, more particular a criminal case depends on its own facts and
> a close similarity between one case and another is not enough to warrant
> like treatment because a significant detail may alter the entire aspect. In
> deciding such cases, one should avoid the temptation to decide cases (as
> said by Cordozo) by matching the colour of one case against the colour of
> another. To decide therefore on which side of the line a case falls, the
> broad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive......"
41\. Similar view has been taken by our own Hon'ble High Court in Sukhvinder
Singh Sandhu vs. C.B.I. 2010 (3) JCC 2324 that it is settled law that it is
the statutory provisions which govern the trial and the court has to act in
accordance with various provisions of Cr. P.C. The judgments of High Courts
and Supreme Court are given in facts and circumstances of each case. Judgments
are not to be read as a statute. Each case represents its own problem
adjudicated upon by the court and unless and until the High Court and Supreme
Court lay down a general principle of law to be followed by the courts below,
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 132 the judgments would have to be considered as
adjudication of the particular issue before the court.
42\. Thence for the clear disposition of law on the subject, I am making it
clear that no sanctity can be attached to the workings in the bail application
of approver for the following reasons: -
(a) In Rampal Pithwa (supra), it was held that bail application of approver as
having been made conscientiously since it was in his own handwriting claiming
himself as innocent.
(b) That in the instant case, bail application on behalf of PW-1 was moved at
the behest of relatives of the approver.
(c) Such application at the behest of relatives of approver was moved in a
routine manner, following a standard format, normally used by the practicing
lawyers on criminal side. Such an application cannot be treated as done
conscientiously by the PW1 himself.
(d) I have already delineated the facts and position of law to hold that no
sanctity can be attached to the wordings in the bail application only to
defeat the true purpose of a remorseful accused, who wants to unscramble the
truth before the Temple of Justice.

10) Effect of Non-examination of Magistrate
43\. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the Judicial Magistrate, who had recorded
the confessional statement of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand @
Vijay and the ACMM, Delhi, who recorded the confessional statement of PW-2
Vikram @ Subir @ Jaldhar Dass u/s 164 Cr. PC, have not been examined to prove
that they voluntarily made their respective statements. Thus, the Ld. Defence
Counsel argued that the order of pardon granted to PW-1 and PW-2 is of no
avail to the prosecution and consequently, the statement of PW-1 and PW-2
cannot be looked into. However, this argument of Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima
Gulati is devoid of any merit in view of Section 80 of Indian Evidence Act,
1872, which reads as under: -
> "80. Presumption as to documents produced as record of evidence - Whenever
> any document is produced before any Court, purporting to be a record or
> memorandum of the evidence, or of any part of the evidence, given by a
> witness in a judicial proceeding or before any officer authorized by law to
> take such evidence, or to be a statement or confession by any prisoner or
> accused person, taken in accordance with law, and purporting to be signed by
> any Judge or Magistrate, or by any such officer as aforesaid, the CBI Vs.
> Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
> Page No. 134 Court shall presume - that the document is genuine; that any
> statements as to the circumstances under which it was taken, purporting to
> be made by the person signing it, are true, and that such evidence,
> statement or confession was duly taken."
44\. PW-1 testified that Ex.PW-1/X is his statement, which he made on
12.05.1975 in the court of SDM Sh. B.K. Derhgawan and bears his signatures at
points A and B. He confirmed that he had given this statement (Ex.PW-1/X)
voluntarily without any pressure or inducement. In his cross-examination, PW-1
testified that his statement u/s 164 of the Cr. PC was recorded from 8.30 AM
to 12.30 PM. This was not recorded by putting question to him and he admitted
on his own. On 12.05.1975, he was shown his statement by Ld. CJM and asked him
whether it was correct. He saw his statement and admitted the same to be
correct. In his further cross-examination, PW-1 testified that before
recording his statement on 12.05.1975, he was not told that he had been made
an approver. On 27.10.1975, when he appeared before CJM, Patna, he was told
that he was given pardon and made an approver. When he appeared before the
CJM, he was alone and later on, he came to know that one Vikram had also been
produced before CJM. He signed as Madan Mohan Srivastava since the CJM had
written his name as Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand. He denied the
suggestion that his statement CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 135 recorded u/s 164 of the Cr.
PC was not shown to him or read out to him on 27.10.1975. He has also denied
the suggestion that he accepted the pardon blindfolded under pressure of the
police. He asserted that the Magistrate had explained him the meaning of
conditional pardon and asked him if his statement was correct and truthful and
would be ready to state the facts truly and correctly in future. He has also
denied the suggestion that he was persuaded to make a statement before the
Magistrate or was tutored later on for making further statement in the court.
45\. The statement of PW-1 dated 12.05.1975 Ex.PW-1/X (is available in the
Folder R-4), reveals that this statement was recorded by Sub-Divisional
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Patna authorized by CJM, Patna regarding the
offence committed at Patna Collectorate premises on 07th day of January, 1974
at about 10.30 AM. The SDJM, Patna has also complied with the mandatory
requirement of section 164 (4) of the Cr. PC.
46\. PW-2 further deposed that after his arrest, he was brought to Delhi on
28.07.1975 and was lodged in Tihar Jail. A Magistrate in Delhi recorded his
statement in the month of August 1975. The Magistrate told him his
designation. He (PW-2) had given that statement before the Magistrate
voluntarily and willingly. As far as he recalled, his statement was recorded
two days after his production before the Magistrate. On first occasion, his
statement was recorded CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 136 in the case regarding throwing of
a bomb on Sh. A.N. Ray and then after a gap of one day, his statement was
recorded in the present case. It was probably a holiday on the day of gap. His
statement was read over to him. He has signed his statement on every page
after seeing it which is at Ex.PW-2/L. The writing at Point A on Statement
Ex.PW- 2/L is in his handwriting and then he signed at point B with a date
under it. (This statement of the approver PW-2 is available in Folder R-43-5).
The record reveals that his statement was recorded by Sh. R.D. Aggarwal, 4 th
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi on 16.08.1975 and 18.08.1975.
On 16.08.1975, the learned ACMM, Delhi after asking the accused, satisfied
himself that there was no threat or inducement to Vikram and he was not under
any coercion. The learned ACMM recorded the statement from 01.15 PM to 04.15
PM which was read over to Vikram and he signed on each page in Hindi by
putting the date 16.08.1975 beneath his signatures on each page. He has
written in his own handwriting in Hindi that he had heard the statement which
is correct and he will make the remaining statement on 18.08.1975. On the
adjourned date also, Vikram stated that in the jail he has not talked to any
police official or jail officer or employee or he wants to complete his
statement made by him on 16.08.1975. His statement was recorded in pre-lunch
and post lunch sessions. Vikram has signed on all the pages in Hindi and
beneath his signatures he has put the date as 18.08.1975. In the end, at point
A and B in his own handwriting, he has written in Hindi that he has CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 137 heard his statement, which is correct and true and he has given
his statement voluntarily. He has again signed after certifying his statement
on 18.08.1975. The Ld. 4th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi has
also complied with the mandatory requirement of Section 164 (4) of the Cr.
PC., which is again signed by accused Vikram in English with date 18.08.1975.
47\. PW-1 has testified that he attended the court of CJM, Patna on
27.10.1975. On that day, he was granted Pardon by the court. He accepted the
Pardon vide his acceptance Ex.PW-1/Y voluntarily. PW- 2 has testified that he
accepted the order of Pardon Ex.PW-1/Y by his writing Mark-X in his hand and
bears his signature with date as 27.10.1975. He was not given any promise nor
was put under pressure by any person. The order of Pardon dated 27.10.1975
passed by the court of CJM, Patna in RC-1/75 under Section 120-B/302/307 IPC
is available in Folder R-65 and this order of Pardon was accepted by PW-1 and
PW-2.
48\. This point as to whether the Magistrate, who has recorded the statement
of a person under Section 164 of the Cr. PC is to be examined during trial to
depose the factum of recording of the statement of such person, has come up
for interpretation before the Privy Council as also before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court. It has been consistently held that the Magistrate is not required to
appear during trial to depose since presumption is attached under Section 80
of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 138 Indian Evidence Act, 1872. This question first
came up before the Privy Council in the year 1936 in Nazir Ahmad v. King-
Emperor (PC) 1936 AIR (PC) 253 and the relevant Para of the judgment reads as
under:-
> "11. As a matter of good sense, the position of accused persons and the

49\. Then, this question came up before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhagwan
Singh Versus The State of Punjab, 1952 AIR (SC) 214, and the relevant Para of
the judgment reads as under: -
> "28. Now, the certificate of the Committing Magistrate endorsed on the
> deposition sheet states that the deposition was read out to the witness and
> that the witness admitted it to be correct. The Court is bound to accept

> 253 AT P. 258, regarding the undesirability of any such practice.
29\. But even if the fact be true that the deposition was not read over, that
would only amount to a curable irregularity and, as the Privy Council observed
in 'Abdul Rehman v. Emperor', AIR 1927 PC 44 at pp. 46, 47, in the absence of
prejudice which must be disclosed in an affidavit which CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 142
shows exactly where the record departs from what the witness actually said,
there is no point in the objection. The object of the reading over prescribed
by Section 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to enable the witness
to change his story but to ensure that the record faithfully and accurately
embodies the gist of what the witness actually said. Therefore, before
prejudice can be substantiated on this score, it must be disclosed by
affidavit exactly where the inaccuracy lies."
50\. Thereafter, this question again came up before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in State of U.P. Vs. Singhara Singh and others, 1964 AIR (SC) 358, and the
relevant Para of the judgment reads as under: -
> "7. In Nazir Ahmed's case, 63 Ind App 372 the Judicial Committee observed
> that the principle applied in Taylor v. Taylor, (1876) 1 Ch. D 426 to a
> Court, namely, that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a

> that which is laid down with such minute particularity in the sections
> themselves."
8\. The rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor (1876) 1 Ch D 426 is well recognized
and is founded on sound principle. Its result is that if a statute has
conferred a power to do an act and has laid down the method in which that
power has to be exercised, it necessarily prohibits the doing of the act in
any other manner than that which has been prescribed. The principle behind the
rule is that if this were not so, the statutory provision might as well not
have been enacted. A magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of
investigation record a confession except in the manner laid down in Section
164. The power to record the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 144 confession had obviously
been given so that the confession might be proved by the record of it made in
the manner laid down. If proof of the confession by other means was
permissible, the whole provision of Section 164 including the safeguards
contained in it for the protection of accused persons would be rendered
nugatory. The section, therefore, by conferring on magistrate the power to
record statements or confessions, by necessary implication, prohibited a
magistrate from giving oral evidence of the statements or confessions made to
him."
51\. This question again came up before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Madi
Ganga Vs. State of Orissa, 1981 AIR (SC) 1165, and the relevant Para of the
judgment reads as under: -
> "With regard to the confessional statement made to the Magistrate his
> submission was that it should have been excluded from the evidence as the
> Magistrate was not examined to prove it.
5\. We desire to express no opinion on the question whether the extra-judicial
confession made to P.Ws. 2 to 5 is barred under Section 24 of the Evidence
Act. It is unnecessary for us to say CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 145 anything on this
question, since we are satisfied that the learned Sessions Judge was wholly
wrong in excluding and the High Court was certainly right in acting upon the
confessional statement made to the Magistrate. The learned Magistrate has put
to the accused all the necessary questions to satisfy himself that the
confession was voluntary. He has also appended the necessary certificate. We
do not accept Shri Jain's submission that the learned Magistrate should have
been examined as a witness. Section 80 of the Evidence Act makes the
examination of the Magistrate unnecessary. It authorises the Court to presume
that the document is genuine, that any statements as to the circumstances
under which it was taken are true and that such confession was truly taken in
accordance with law. Shri Jain submitted that if the Magistrate had been
examined as a witness, the accused might have been in a position to show, by
cross-examination that the confession recorded by the Magistrate was not
voluntary. The Magistrate has appended a certificate that he was satisfied
that the confession was voluntary. No circumstance has been brought out in the
evidence justifying the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 146 calling of the Magistrate as a
witness. We do not think that the circumstances of the case justify any
comment on the alleged failure of the prosecution to examine the Magistrate as
a witness.
52\. Having discussed the settled position of law as above, this court does
not see any ground to discard the prosecution case for non- examining the
Judicial Magistrates, who had recorded the confessional statements of PW-1
Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Aacharya Visheshwaranand Avadhoot and PW-2 Vikram @
Jaldhar Dass @ Subir, since;
(i) Section 80 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 attaches judicial sanctity to all
such court records and statement made on oath at any stage of investigation or
trial.
(ii) Such statements cannot be ignored unless and until the defence point out
that the same were involuntary.
(iii) Non-examination of Magistrate would not be fatal to the case of the
prosecution as held in Nazir Ahmed by Privy Council, and in Singhara Singh's
case (supra), Bhagwan Singh's case (supra) and in Madi Ganga's case (supra) by
Hon'ble Supreme Court and mandate of law to be culled out as done above.
(iv) The confessional statements per se carry the due certificates of the
Magistrates recording the confessions as required by CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 147 law.
The SDJM, Patna after recording the statement of PW-1 has certified that he
believed the confession to have been made voluntarily and the same was read
over to him and he has admitted the same to be correct. Similarly, 4 th ACMM,
Delhi had after recording the statement of PW-2 has certified that he believed
the confession to have been made voluntarily and the same was read over to him
and he has admitted the same to be correct.
11) Whether PW-1 was induced?
53\. Ms. Sima Gulati, Ld. Counsel for accused Gopalji argued that the approver
PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand was induced of his reinstatement
after about 11 years of his termination from service and as such, his
confessional statement and consequent statement made in the court cannot be
relied upon. She argued that PW-1 was working in the office of Superintendent
Engineer, PWD, Darbhanga, from where he resigned in the year 1964 and he was
arrested on 29.04.1975 and the Superintendent Engineer on 30.04.1975
communicated his reinstatement to him. PW-1 has applied vide application
Ex.PW-1/C in March 1964 for permission to leave the station. He also sent a
telegram Ex.PW-1/D dated 16.3.1964 for extension of leave. He submitted his
resignation letter dated 15.04.1964 Ex.PW-1/E. She argued that PW-1 was
granted bail on 08.05.1975 and his confessional statement u/s 164 Cr. PC on
application of the investigating officer was recorded on 12.05.1975 CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 148 and he rejoined the service on 13.05.1975 and he was granted
pardon by the CJM, Patna on 27.10.1975. She argued that application for
reinstatement is pre-dated and does not bear any date and stamp of receiving
in the office. She argued that in his application, PW-1 has mentioned that he
remained moving from one place to another and later on filed a false medical
certificate to the effect that he was suffering from a mental disease
'melancholia' from 1964 to 1974.
54\. Ld. Defence Counsel has relied upon judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Mohd. Khalid vs. State of West Bengal : 2002 (7) SCC 334 wherein it has been
held as under :
> "28. That brings us to another angle i.e. acceptability of the confession.
> Section 24 of the Evidence Act interdicts a confession if it appears to the

55\. To buttress her arguments, Ld. Defence Counsel also referred another
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Aloke Nath Dutta vs. State of West Bengal
2007 (12) SCC 230 and relevant Para 86 and 87 of the judgment read as under:-
> "86. Confession ordinarily is admissible in evidence. It is a relevant fact.

> to law laid down by the superior judiciary from time to time form the basis

> "22. This confession was retracted by the appellant when he was examined at

Therefore, when in a capital case the prosecution demands a conviction of the
accused, primarily on the basis of his confession recorded Under Section CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 151 164 Criminal Procedure Code, the Court must apply a
double test:
                        (1)     Whether   the   confession     was    perfectly
                        voluntary?
                        (2) If so, whether it is true and trustworthy?
Satisfaction of the first test is a sine quo non for its admissibility in
evidence. If the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any
inducement, threat or promise such as is mentioned in Section 24, Evidence
Act, it must be excluded and rejected brevimanu. In such a case, the question
of proceeding further to apply the second test does not arise. If the first
test is satisfied, the Court must before acting upon the confession reach the
finding that what is stated therein is true and reliable. For judging, the
reliability of such a confession or for that matter of any substantive piece
of evidence there is no rigid canon of universal application. Even so, one
broad method, which may be useful in most cases for evaluating a confession,
may be indicated. The Court should carefully examine the confession and
compare it with the rest of the evidence, in the light of the surrounding
circumstances and probabilities of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 152 case. If on such
examination and comparison, the confession appears to be a probable catalogue
of events and naturally fits in with the rest of the evidence and the
surrounding circumstances, it may be taken to have satisfied the second test."
56\. The Ld. Defence Counsel has cited another judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in State (N.C.T. of Delhi) vs. Navjot Sandhu 2005 (11) SCC 600 on the
same point and Para 8 of the judgment reads as under :-
> "8. Law regarding confessions We start with the confessions. Under the
> general law of the land as reflected in the Indian Evidence Act, no
> confession made to a police officer can be proved against an accused.
> 'Confessions' - which is a terminology used in criminal law is a species of

> admission is a statement - oral or documentary, which enables the court to

It is trite to say that every confession must necessarily be an admission,
but, every admission does not necessarily amount to a confession. While
Sections 17 to 23 deal with admissions, the law as to confessions is embodied
in Sections 24 to 30 of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 153 the Evidence Act. Section 25 bars
proof of a confession made to a police officer. Section 26 goes a step further
and prohibits proof of confession made by any person while he is in the
custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a
Magistrate. Section 24 lays down the obvious rule that a confession made under
any inducement, threat or promise becomes irrelevant in a criminal proceeding.
Such inducement, threat or promise need not be proved to the hilt. If it
appears to the court that the making of the confession was caused by any
inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority, the
confession is liable to be excluded from evidence. The expression 'appears'
connotes that the Court need not go to the extent of holding that the threat
etc. has in fact been proved. If the facts and circumstances emerging from the
evidence adduced make it reasonably probable that the confession could be the
result of threat, inducement or pressure, the court will refrain from acting
on such confession, even if it be a confession made to a Magistrate or a
person other than police officer....."

57\. PW-1 testified about his personal details i.e. his application for
employment, resignation and re-employment. Ex.PW-1/A is application submitted
by him to his employer dated 19.08.1974 addressed to Superintendant Engineer,
Darbhanga Circle, to the effect that he was appointed as a Correspondence
Clerk and joined circle office on 8.8.1961 and remained on duty till
15.03.1964 and due to family problems he left home and remained moving from
one holy place to another and he has no source of subsistence to give relief
to his old parents and he being the only son came to his senses and came back
to his parents and he may be allowed to join duty. He deposed that he had
submitted a reminder Ex.PW-1/G in connection with his reinstatement to the
Superintendent Engineer which was received in the receipt section at serial
no. 7276 dated 19.09.1974. He received an office order from Superintendant
Engineer on 30.04.1975 to join service and at that time he was not present in
his house and he received the letter only on his return to home on 13.05.1975
when he was relieved from the court of SDM, Patna as he was attending his
court date for his statement which was completed on 12.05.1975 under Section
164 Cr. PC and he gave his joining report Ex.PW-1/B on 13.05.1975. PW-1
further testified that Ex.PW-1/X is statement, which he made on 12.05.1975 in
the court of SDM Sh. B.K. Derhgawan and bear his signatures at point A and B
and he gave his statement voluntarily without any pressure or inducement. He
attended the court of CJM, Patna on 27.10.1975 when pardon was CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 155 granted to him and he accepted the pardon voluntarily vide his
acceptance Ex.PW-1/Y.
58\. It is elicited in his cross-examination that in the note Ex.PW- 1/DD, it
was mentioned that one Udit Narain Mishra, Clerk, who was posted at Khagaria
under the jurisdiction of Superintendant Engineer, was reinstated after a gap
of 6/7 years and his case was cited as a precedent to recommend his
appointment. In the cross-examination, PW-1 further replied that he personally
submitted application Ex.PW- 1/A in the office of Superintendant Engineer at
Lahariya Sarai. He further clarified that there was no dispute with the
parents except that he was not agreeable for marriage at that time as proposed
by them. It was on this account that he mentioned that Ex.PW-1/A, the reason
of leaving home was a family trouble. It is further elicited in his cross-
examination that the endorsement Ex.PW-1/DD dated "04.10" in the file Ex.P-1
is in the handwriting of Sh. R.P. Verma, Superintendant Engineer. It was not
his fresh appointment and he would have been barred by age, had it been a
fresh appointment. His services were regarded "as continuing", but pay for the
period of his absence and increment for that period were not given to him. He
has denied the suggestion that this would be allowed on the conditions of his
making statement as desired by CBI.
59\. I have perused the Service Book of PW-1 (which is available in folder
R-26) and at page no. 44, there is an application submitted CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 156 by PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava addressed to Superintendent
Engineer, PWD, Darbhanga dated 19.08.1974 Ex.PW-1/A to the effect that he was
mentally disturbed. He pleaded therein that to save him and his parents from
starvation he may be allowed to join the services. This application was duly
received in the office of Superintendent Engineer, PWD, Darbhanga, at Serial
No.6428 on 26.08.1974 with the seal of the office. Ex.PW-1/G is the reminder
dated 17.9.1974 as per which he again requested Superintendent Engineer to
join services and this has been received in the office of Superintendent
Engineer, PWD, Darbhanga at serial no.7276 on 18.9.1974 with the seal of the
office. By office note Ex.PW-1/DD dated 04.10.1974, there is reference of
reinstatement of a previous employee after about six years of termination of
his service. There are various office notes for recommendations in favour of
PW-1 vide Ex.PW-1/DD (Dated 4.10.1974) and other office notes and formal
approval was issued on 12.4.1975. He was appointed on 30.04.1975 as per office
note at Ex.PW-1/H. He received this communication on his return to home on
13.5.1974 after recording his statement u/s 164 Cr. PC on 12.5.1975. He
submitted his joining report Ex.PW-1/B on 13.5.1975. However, his application
for reinstatement was allowed vide orders Ex.PW-1/H as per the service book on
12.4.1975 yet his case was recommended on 04.10.1974 vide office note
Ex.PW-1/DD and some other office notes of subsequent dates.

60\. The argument of Ld. Defence Counsel that PW-1 has mentioned in the letter
for reinstatement that he was moving from one holy place to another which
cannot be believed. After considering the statement in his cross-examination
that PW-1 having mentioned "Ashram" as symbolical meaning, the argument does
not sound to any reason. He further testified in his cross-examination that as
the Government was not going well with Anand Marg, he did not mention that he
had joined Anand Marg and symbolically mentioned that his parents had become
old in his application Ex.PW-1/A.
61\. The above said facts including the dates of submitting application dated
26.8.1974 for reinstatement received in office on 26.08.1974, reminder dated
17.09.1974, office note and consequential communication of his reinstatement
clearly shows that PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava had applied for his
reinstatement long before he was arrested. It was almost nine months after his
prayer for reinstatement, his case was also recommended for reinstatement on
04.10.1974 as per office notes Ex.PW-1/DD and other office notes, and
appointment order was issued on 12.04.1975. It clearly reflects that the
recommendation of reinstatement was already issued by the concerned
appropriate authority even much before his arrest. Therefore, the arguments
that PW-1 was induced to turn an approver after his arrest with a luring is
highly improbable and is nothing but a figment of imagination by the accused
persons with sole purpose to save their skin and mud-slinging the PW-1 and
prosecuting agency.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 158 The alleged allurement also falls on the ground since
the C.B.I. being the investigating agency under a separate enactment does not
have any administrative control or in remote sense to influence the policy
decisions of a different state namely the State of Bihar. Therefore, it cannot
be said that C.B.I. had any role in the reinstatement of PW-1 Madan Mohan
Srivastava.
12) Evidentiary Value of Approver/Accomplice
62\. This case is based on statement of two approvers namely (i) Madan Mohan
Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand @ Vijay (PW-1) and
(ii) Vikram @ Subir @ Jaldhar Dass (PW-2). Therefore, it is necessary to find
out the legal position regarding law on accomplices/approvers.
63\. It is appropriate to refer to Section 133 of the Indian Evidence Act,
1872 along with Illustration (b) to Section 114 which read as under:-
> "133. Accomplice - An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an
> accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds
> upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice."
> Illustration (b) to Section 114.
> (b) That an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in
> material particulars."
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 159
64\. An approver is a person, who has actively participated in the crime, and
facts which are known to approver cannot be known to other persons. He is the
best person to tell the facts but his evidence requires corroboration in
material particulars which depend upon the facts and circumstances of each
case.
65\. Dealing with the scope and ambit of the above-noted two provisions, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Bhiva Doulu Patil v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1963
Supreme Court 599 has held that both the sections are part of one subject and
have to be considered together. It has further been held: (Para 7) "The
combined effect of Sections 133 and Illustration (b) to Section 114, may be
stated as follows:
According to the former, which is a Rule of law, an accomplice is competent to
give evidence and to the latter, which is a Rule of practice it is usually
unsafe to convict upon his testimony alone. Therefore, though the conviction
of an accused on the testimony of an accomplice cannot be said to be illegal
yet the courts will, as a matter of practice, not accept the evidence of such
a witness without corroboration in material particulars."
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 160
66\. The very same principle was reiterated in Mohd. Husain Umar Kochra etc.
v. K. S. Dalipsinghji and another, (1969) 3 SCC 429 and it was held: (Para
21).
> ".... The combined effect of Sections 133 and 114, Illustration (b) is that
> though a conviction based upon accomplice evidence is legal, the Court will
> not accept such evidence unless it is corroborated in material particulars.
> The corroboration must connect the accused with the crime. It may be direct
> or circumstantial. It is not necessary that the corroboration should confirm
> all the circumstances of the crime. It is sufficient if the corroboration is
> in material particulars. The corroboration must be from an independent
> source. One accomplice cannot corroborate another."
67\. Both the sections have also been interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Mrinal Das v. State of Tripura 2011 (9) SCC 479 in the following words
(Para No. 11 & 12):-
> "11. Though a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds on the
> uncorroborated testimony of an approver, yet the universal practice is not
> to convict upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated in
> material particulars. The evidence of an approver does not CBI Vs.
> Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
> Page No. 161 differ from the evidence of any other witness save in one
> particular aspect, namely, that the evidence of an accomplice is regarded ab
> initio as open to grave suspicion.
> 12\. If the suspicion which attaches to the evidence of an accomplice be not
> removed, that evidence should not be acted upon unless corroborated in some
> material particulars; but if the suspicion attaching to the accomplice's
> evidence be removed, then that evidence may be acted upon even though
> uncorroborated, and the guilt of the accused may be established upon the
> evidence alone."
68\. Very recently, these provisions came up for consideration before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prithipal Singh v. State of Punjab 2012(1) SCC 10,
which laid down the following principle:-
> "18. An accomplice is a competent witness and conviction can lawfully rests
> upon his uncorroborated testimony, yet the court is entitled to presume and
> may indeed, be justified in presuming in the generality of cases that no
> reliance can be placed on the evidence of an accomplice unless the evidence
> is corroborated in material particulars, which means that there has to be
> some independent witness tending to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
> Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 162 incriminate the
> particular accused in the commission of the crime. (Vide: Rameshwar v. The
> State of Rajasthan, AIR 1952 Supreme Court 54; and Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh
> v. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 Supreme Court 637).
> 21\. In view of the above, the law on the issue can be summarized to the
> effect that the deposition of an accomplice in a crime who has not been made
> an accused/put to trial, can be relied upon, however, the evidence is
> required to be considered with care and caution. An accomplice who has not
> been put on trial is a competent witness as he deposes in the court after
> taking oath and there is no prohibition in any law not to act upon his
> deposition without corroboration."
69\. The approver is not required to prove entire prosecution story or even
all the material particulars and if such a view is adopted, it would render
evidence of the accomplice wholly superfluous. This is so held by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh vs. State of Punjab AIR 1957 SC 637
and Para 7 reads as under :-
> "It would not be right that expect that such independent corroboration
> should cover the whole of the prosecution story or even all the material
> particulars. If such a view is adopted it would CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
> Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 163
> render the evidence of the accomplice wholly superfluous. On the other hand,
> it would not be safe to act upon such evidence merely because it is
> corroborated in minor particulars or incidental details because, in such a
> case, corroboration does not afford the necessary assurance that the main
> story disclosed by the approver can be reasonably and safely accepted as
> true."
70\. In Bhubon Sahu v. The King, (AIR 1949 PC 257), it was observed that the
rule requiring corroboration for acting upon the evidence of an accomplice is
a rule of prudence. However, the rule of prudence assumes great significance
when its reliability on the touchstone of credibility is examined. If it is
found credible and cogent, the Court can record a conviction even on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. On the subject of the credibility
of the testimony of an accomplice, the proposition that an accomplice must be
corroborated does not mean that there must be cumulative or independent
testimony to the same facts to which he has testified. At the same time, the
presumption available under Section 114 of the Evidence Act is of
significance. It says that the Court may presume that an accomplice is
unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in "material particulars".
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 164
71\. Section 133 of the Evidence Act expressly provides that an accomplice is
a competent witness and the conviction is not illegal merely because it
proceeds on an uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. In other words, this
section renders admissible such uncorroborated testimony. Nevertheless, this
Section has to be read along with Section 114, illustration (b). The latter
section empowers the Court to presume the existence of certain facts and the
illustration elucidates what the Court may presume and make clear by means of
examples as to what facts the Court shall have regard in considering whether
or not maxims illustrated apply to a given case. Illustration
(b) in express terms says that accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is
corroborated in material particulars. The Statute permits the conviction of an
accused based on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice but the rule of
prudence embodied in illustration (b) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act
strikes a note of warning, cautioning the Court that an accomplice does not
generally deserve to be believed unless corroborated in material particulars.
In other words, the rule is that the necessity of corroboration is a matter of
prudence except when it is safe to dispense with such corroboration must be
clearly present in the mind of the Judge. (See Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State
of Bihar AIR 1994 SC 2420.)
72\. Although Section 114 illustration (b) provides that the Court may presume
that the evidence of an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless corroborated,
"may" is not must and no decision of Court can CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 165 make it
must. The Court is not obliged to hold that he is unworthy of credit. It
ultimately depends upon the Court's view as to the credibility of evidence
tendered by an accomplice.
73\. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of T.N. v. Suresh and another
1998 SC 1044 has laid down the following principle:-
> "Thus, the law is not that the evidence of an accomplice deserves outright
> rejection if there is no corroboration. What is required is to adopt great
> circumspection and care when dealing with the evidence of an accomplice.
> Though there is no legal necessity to seek corroboration of accomplice's
> evidence it is desirable that Court seeks reassuring circumstances to
> satisfy the judicial conscience that the evidence is true."
74\. In Sitaram Sao @ Mungeri v. State of Jharkhand : 2007 (12) SCC 630, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that there must be some additional evidence
rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is
true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it and the relevant extract is
as under: -
> "26. First, it is not necessary that there should be independent
> confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the
> independent CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
> 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 166 evidence in the case, apart from the
> testimony of the complainant or the accomplice, should in itself be
> sufficient to sustain conviction. As Lord Readings says -
> 'Indeed, if it were required that the accomplice should be confirmed in
> every detail of the crime, his evidence would not be essential to the case,
> it would be merely confirmatory of other and independent testimony.'
> 27\. All that is required is that there must be some additional evidence
> rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is
> true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it.
28\. Secondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe
that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend
to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the
testimony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the
crime. This does not mean that the corroboration as to identify must extend to
all the circumstances necessary to identify the accused with the offence.
Again, all that is necessary is that there would be independent CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 167 evidence, which will make it reasonably safe to believe the
witness's story that the accused was the one, or among those, who committed
the offence. The reason for this part of the rule is that -
"a man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate
the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only on the truth of that
history, without identifying the persons, that is really no corroboration at
all ...... It would not at all tend to show that the party accused
participated in it."
29\. Thirdly, the corroboration must come from independent sources and thus
ordinarily the testimony of one accomplice would not be sufficient to
corroborate that of another. But of course the circumstances may be such as to
make it safe to dispense with the necessity of corroboration and in those
special circumstances a conviction so based would not be illegal. I say this
because it was contended that the mother in this case was not an independent
source.
30\. Fourthly, the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused
committed the crime. It is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 168 of his connection with the crime. Were it otherwise,
"many crimes which are usually committed between accomplices in secret, such
as incest, offences with females' (or unnatural offences) 'could never be
brought to justice". [See: M.O. Shamsudhin vs. State of Kerala 1995 (3) SCC
351.
31\. The above position was highlighted in K.
Hashim vs. State of Tamil Nadu 2005(1) SCC
237."
Thus, the statements of approvers PW-1 and PW-2 may be safely looked into but
subject to their reliability and prudent test of corroboration of material
particulars, of course to believe uncorroborated testimony also based on the
circumstantial evidence that is presented by the prosecution. At the same time
the court cannot ignore the guidelines under the above Supreme Court rulings
that an accomplice need not stand the test of proving each and every
circumstance, since the chain of events that follow the material particulars
corroborated would speak for itself. "It would not be right that expect that
such independent corroboration should cover the whole of the prosecution story
or even all the material particulars. If such a view is adopted it would
render the evidence of the accomplice wholly superfluous" (Sarwan Singh Rattan
Singh- supra).

13) Prelude to criminal conspiracy, Anand Marg - founder - wings - objects.
75\. Now I shall proceed to examine the evidence placed on record to arrive at
the adjudication of the charges, for which, this court filed that the subject
may be divided under different captions for the purposes of understanding the
case of the prosecution and that of the defence.
76\. PW-1 deposed that he remained associated with Anand Marg from the year
1964 to February 1974. He joined Civil Defence (Urban Home Guard) as a part
time worker in the year 1962 and at that time Sh. S.N. Srivastava was S.P. and
one Sham Lal Dass was the Company Commander. Both of them were the followers
of Anand Marg. Sh. Munshi Singh, Hawaldar, who was working there, was also an
Anand Margi and he used to give training in Urban Home Guard. Sh. S.N.
Srivastava and Sham Lal Dass influenced him with the philosophy of Anand Marg
and he learnt Sadhna from Sham Lal Dass. He along with Sham Lal Dass was taken
to Muzaffarpur to attend Dharam Chakra and to meet Anand Murti. On 15.3.1964,
he met Prakashanand Avadhoot, P.A of Anand Murti and then he met Anand Murti
whose real name was Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (P.R. Sarkar) and followers used to
call him Guru/Marg Guru/Anand Murti. He sat before him and Anand Murti shut
his eyes and pulled his ears. On the direction of Anand Murti, he confessed to
his bad deeds and Anand Murti asked him to enlist three lac people in the
field of Anand Marg.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 170 He became full time worker by submitting an
application to Prakashanand Avadhoot. He addressed his application to General
Secretary, Anand Marg. He was Sh. P.K. Chatterjee. He sent a telegram for one-
month leave to his employer. He went to Jamalpur. He stayed for 3 or 4 days in
the Ashram of Anand Marg. At the instance of P.K. Chatterjee, General
Secretary, he went to Anand Nagar where he stayed for 3 or 4 days. Then he was
sent to Patna in the office of PFI (Progressive Federation of India) which is
a wing of Anand Marg. Vishokanand Avadhoot was the Chief Secretary of PFI. He
remained there for two or three months. He was made Tatvik and Aacharya of
Anand Marg. He was appointed Provincial Secretary of PFI of M.P. in August
1964 and was sent to Bhopal. Sh. Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal was the Organizing
Secretary at Bhopal. From Bhopal, he went to Jabalpur. He met Arteshanand
there (he was present in the court). Thereafter, he was sent to Banaras for
training in Sewa Dharam Mission, a wing of Anand Marg Organization. From
Banaras, he came to Jamalpur. There he received Kapalik Diksha from Anand
Murti in the year 1965. For that purpose, he brought two human skulls from
Ganga River and Diksha as Avadhoot was given to him by Prakashanand on behalf
of Anand Murti. From that night, he started wearing saffron clothes and was
rechristened as Aacharya Visheshwaranand Avadhoot. As an Avadhoot, he was to
wear lungi, kurta, a turban of saffron colour and one has to sport long beard
and moustaches and carry a kirpan in his hand. He went to Indore where CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 171 they started publishing monthly and fortnightly papers/magazines
of PFI to propagate the teaching of PFI & Anand Marg. He testified that
Voluntary Social Service @ Vishwa Shanti Sena (V.S.S.) is a Para Military Wing
of Anand Marg and Aacharya Ram Aasrey of Arrah was the Chief Trainee Organizer
of V.S.S. PW-1 participated in V.S.S. Camp and he used to give training. He
was appointed Area Commander of VSS. State of Maharashtra, M.P., Rajasthan and
Gujarat were put under his supervision. His Headquarters was at 20, Ulta Mount
Road, Bombay. His duties were to select volunteers and give them training and
to materialize Anand Marg programme. He remained Area Commander of V.S.S until
1970. In the year 1970, a camp was held in Gaya (Bihar) and he fell ill and
remained on bed for six months. From there, he went to Ranchi in May 1971 to
attend Dharam Maha Chakra- a congregation of devotees held twice in a year
addressed by Anand Murti. From Ranchi, he came to Ludhiana and then to Delhi.
At Delhi, Aacharya Santoshanand Avadhoot (Accused No.1), whose original name
was Ghanshyam and whose father was working for "PRADEEP and Vishwabandhu"
published from Patna, was working for the organisation. He knew Santoshanand
even before. From Ranchi, he was transferred to PBI (Proutist Block of India),
a political wing of Anand Marg. Then he was posted at Anand Marg Primary
School, Bilaspur. He worked there at Bilaspur until August 1972, when he was
transferred to Jabalpur as Principal, Anand Marg Primary School and worked
there until July 1978. In CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 172 February 1973, he was called in
Delhi for Rally at Boat-Club for pressing release of Baba. He was arrested.
After his release, he went from Delhi to Jabalpur. It was impressed upon in
the mind of workers that Anand Murti was seriously ill so that the followers
work with renewed zeal. He deposed that Headquarters of Anand Marg was at
Patna. ERAWS (Education Relief and Welfare Section) was another wing of Anand
Marg. He went back to Ranchi from where he was transferred to political wing
of Anand Marg known as Proutist Block of India and made Incharge of Sholapur
and Kolhapur diocese. He deposed that there was also a Revolutionary Group of
Anand Marg. He identified all accused persons i.e. accused no.1 Santoshanand,
accused no.2 Sudevanand, accused no.3 Ranjan Dwivedi and accused no.7 Gopalji
in the Court correctly.
77\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 further testified that he stated before
the Magistrate that Anand Murti caught him by his ear and asked him to confess
his faults and when confronted with his previous statement, it was not found
recorded. He did not remember whether he stated before the Magistrate that as
"punishment", he was asked by Anand Murti to enroll three lacs persons in the
Organisation and when confronted with his previous statement, the word
"punishment" was not found mentioned. Simply because in his previous statement
there is no mention that Anand Murti caught his ear or that the word
"punishment" is not mentioned, PW-1 cannot be said to have made any
improvement as it was a matter of detail and elaboration. Here it is CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 173 relevant to mention that in his cross-examination, the defence
has not discredited the original name of A-1 as Ghanshyam. The defence did not
shatter his deposition that the father of A-1 was working in the editorial
staff of newspapers "PRADEEP" and "Vishwabandhu". As such the testimony of
PW-1 on the other points goes unrebutted and the same are not demolished in
the cross-examination and therefore, the testimony of PW-1 cannot be discarded
in so far as the facts deposed regarding the organisation - founder - objects
- the role of PW-1 in it and the different wings the organisation. The
competency of the witness to identify A-1, A-2, A-3 & A-7 was never
questioned.
78\. Thus it is evident from the testimony PW-1 that there was an organisation
called Anand Marg, and Sh. Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (P.R. Sarkar), the head of
the organization, used to be called as Guru/Marg Guru/Anand Murti by his
followers. PW-1 joined Anand Marg in 1964\. He was appointed Provincial
Secretary of PFI in August 1964. He remained posted at various places namely
Bhopal, Jabalpur, Banaras, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Ludhiana, Indore on various
posts in Anand Marg including Area Commander of VSS. He was posted as
Principal, Anand Marg Primacy School and worked there until July 1978\. In
1973, he was called in Delhi for attending Rally at Boat- Club for pressing
release of Baba. He was arrested there and after his release, he went from
Delhi to Jabalpur. There were five wings of Anand Marg i.e. (i) PFI
(Progressive Federation of India), (ii) Sewa Dharam Mission, (iii) Voluntary
Social Service @ Vishva Shanti Sena CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 174 (VSS) a Para
military wing, (iv) ERAWS (Education Relief and Welfare Section) and (v)
Political Wing PBI (Proutist Block of India). There was a Revolutionary Group
of Anand Marg. It also comes out from his statement that original name of
accused no.1 Santoshanand was Ghanshyam and his father was working in
editorial staff of paper "PRADEEP" & "Vishwabandhu" published from Patna and
he knew accused no.1 Santoshanand prior to that. PW-1 was rechristened as
Aacharya Visheshwaranand in the year 1965 after he took Diksha as Avadhoot. It
also comes out from the testimony of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava that after he
took Diksha in the year 1965, he started putting on saffron clothes. As an
Avadhoot, he started wearing lungi, kurta, a turban of saffron colour and
sporting long hair, beard and moustaches and carrying a kirpan.
79\. A close reading of his testimony reveals that this witness had withstood
searching and elaborate cross examination at the hands of the accused and
nothing is elicited to discard his testimony which is accurate on every count
concerning the subject in discussion. It is note-worthy to mention that the
accused could not smash his testimony as regards his long association with
Anand Marg.
80\. PW-2 Jaldhar Dass @ Vikram @ Subir, another approver, deposed that he
originally belonged to Village Trar, District Bhagalpur. He had studied up to
11th standard. In the year 1965, he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 175 met Aacharya
Pashupatiji, a Pracharak of Anand Marg and took Diksha from him. Sh. P.R.
Sarkar, referred to as Anand Murti, was supreme head of Anand Marg
organization. He was also known as Baba/Marg Guru. He deposed that full time
training as Anand Margi used to be imparted in the institution Sewa Dharam
Mission, a branch of Anand Marg, located at Banaras. He went to Banaras under
the direction of Pashupatiji for getting training as a full time worker of
Anand Marg towards the end of 1968. There, he met Aacharya Prakashanand and
after one week, he filled up a Form Ex.PW-2/A, which is in his own handwriting
and bears his signatures at points A & B. Copy of this form was sent to his
guardian. He remained there for about 4-5 months after receiving training.
Until then his name was Jaldhar Das and after conclusion of the training, he
was rechristened as Vikram. The handwriting and signatures of PW-2 on Form
Ex.PW- 2/A have been identified by PW-68.
81\. PW-2 further testified that Prakashanand informed him that Anand Murti
had rechristened him as Vikram. At that time, Headquarter of Anand Marg was at
Ranchi. Prakashanand at the conclusion of the training gave him a closed
envelope addressed to Vishokanand, PA to Anand Murti, for being delivered at
Ranchi. On reaching Ranchi, he delivered the envelope to Vishokanand. He
stayed there (at Ranchi) for 3-4 days and then he was given posting order for
Chinsura (WB) as Press Manager of Anand Marg Printing Press in June/July 1969.
He deposed that he remained there until the end of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 176 1969,
when he received telegram from Aacharya Advetanand from Ranchi whereby he was
called to Ranchi. Aacharya Advetanand (PW- 68 Sudhir Kumar Basedar) was
Finance Secretary of Proutist Forum of India, a wing of Anand Marg, and its
headquarter was located at D- 41, South Extension-I, New Delhi. The posting of
Advetanand was at New Delhi but at that time, he was at Ranchi. He stayed at
Ranchi for a day or so when Advetanand brought him to New Delhi. On the ground
floor of D-41, South Extension, Part-1, there was a printing press and on the
first floor, there was office of Proutist Forum of India. A newspaper by the
name of Prout and a magazine "Education and culture" used to be published from
this premises. 1st Floor of Building was also used for boarding and lodging.
Advetanand introduced him there at New Delhi to Santoshanand. (The witness
correctly identified accused Santoshanand in the Court). He further testified
that Santoshanand was working as Editor of the newspaper Prout and magazine
"Education and culture". All the workers including Santoshanand used to
practice Sadhna on the first floor and once a week, Dharam chakra used to be
held in the building. Anand Margies coming from other districts used to
participate therein. Accused Santoshanand used to attire in the same dress in
which he appears in the Court. PW-2 deposed that Santoshanand earlier sported
long beard, long hair, wears saffron colour turban, saffron colour kurta and
Tehmad and waist band. He (PW-2) met accused Ranjan Dwivedi and Sudevanand in
South Extension building. (The witness has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 177 correctly
identified both the accused Ranjan Dwivedi and Sudevanand in the Court). PW-2
further deposed that Sudevanand also used to appear in the similar clothes in
which he is clad now (as on the date of deposition). He deposed that
Sudevanand had posting as Anand Margi Avadhoot in UP and Ranjan Dwivedi was
from Bihar and he used to live in Delhi in that building for 2-3 days and
sometimes only for 2 hours and Santoshanand lived there permanently in the
said building.
82\. It is also found in his testimony that accused Santoshanand used to write
in his presence and he can identify his writing and signatures. He stayed
there with Santoshanand up to end of the year 1972, when he (PW-2) was posted
at Jaipur as Press Manager of Anand Printers. During 3 years' stay at D-41,
South Extension, he used to work on the press and distribute publications. He
used to compose the writings of Santoshanand. One Dhaneshanand, who was living
in D-41, South Extension, was the Chief Secretary of Proutist Forum of India.
At the end of year 1972, he was posted at Jaipur as Press Manager of Anand
Printers belonging to Anand Marg Organisation. He received this order from the
Head Office at Ranchi through Sh. Dhaneshanand. He went to Jaipur and remained
posted there until June 1974. In between, he came to Delhi in April 1973, when
a Rally was organized in Delhi to demand release of Anand Murti, who was
confined in Patna Jail at that time. He came there at D-41, South Extension-1
at the end of June 1974\. He was directed to join Delhi Printing Press until
Jaipur Press was repaired. He came to D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi.
There CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 178 he met Dhaneshanand, Chief Secretary had told him
that Jaipur Printing Press was out of repair and substantial amount was
required for putting it into the working order. At that time, Santoshanand was
not found there. He came to know that police was searching Santoshanand after
self-immolation by Dineshwaranand at Purana Quilla, New Delhi. Dineshwaranand
prior to his death used to come to D-41, South Extension, New Delhi. After one
or two days of his reaching there, at the end of June 1974, accused
Santoshanand met him in the market of South Extension-I, New Delhi. At that
time, Santoshanand was wearing pant, shirt and he got his haircut. He was
putting a hearing aid in his ear. He was sporting short moustaches. His beard
was shaven.
83\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 deposed that he had taken Diksha when he
was in 9th Class and at that time he would be 15 or 16 years of age. He
admitted the suggestion of the defence that a copy of Application Form
(Ex.PW-2/A), which was filled up at Banaras in the beginning of 1969, was sent
to his parents. He also admitted the suggestion of the defence that he stayed
in Delhi for 2 ½ or 3 years, when he came from Ranchi. He was sent to Jaipur
for being appointed as Manager of the Press. He further testified that he
worked as Manager with the Printing Press of Anand Marg at Jaipur. The press
went out of order in March 1974. He used to maintain accounts of all the
expenses on working this press. He admitted the suggestion of the defence at
Page No. 91 that he came to Delhi in 1969 and remained CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 179
there up to the end of 1972. In his further cross-examination, PW-2 testified
that the Press at Jaipur was already registered in the name of Anand Marg and
declaration had already been given before he went there. He was not aware
whether such declaration had to be given every year. It was a small printing
press and such formalities could be spared. He has denied the suggestion that
he was not the Press Manager at Jaipur. The local committee of Anand Marg by a
Resolution had authorized him to operate the bank account. The joint account
was in his name and that of Tara Chand (DW-8), which was opened with an
initial deposit of Rs.100/-.
84\. While going through the deposition of PW-2, I found that his examination-
in-chief is recorded from Page No. 1 to 29 (running Page No. 145 to 173) on
28.04.1981, 29.04.1981, 30.04.1981 and 22.05.1981 and he has been cross-
examined at length on several dates by the Defence Counsel separately from
22.05.1981 to 13.11.1981 from Page No. 29 to 338 (running Page No. 173 to
483). The defence has confronted the witness with his several statements,
which are consisting of (i) Ex.PW-2/DA, which is the statement made by PW-2
before the court of Ld. ASJ in A.N. Ray's case, (ii) Ex.PW-2/DB, which is the
statement of PW-2 under Section 161 of Cr. PC recorded on 10.08.1975 by Sh.
B.R. Puri in A.N. Ray's case, (iii) Ex.PW-2/DC, which is the statement of PW-2
recorded under Section 164 Cr. PC in A.N. Ray's case, (iv) Ex.PW-2/DD is a two
page copy of the statement of PW-2 recorded on 24.07.1975 & 25.07.1975 under
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 180 Section 161 Cr. PC in FIR No. 71 of 1974 known as

(v) Ex.PW-2/DE is the statement of PW-2 recorded on 09.08.1975 under Section
161 Cr. PC by Sh. B.R. Puri in Samastipur Bomb Blast case, (vi) Ex.PW-2/DF is
the statement of PW-2 recorded in the Committal Court i.e. CMM, Delhi on
several dates from 21.04.1980 to 07.05.1980, (vii) Ex.PW-2/DK is the statement
of PW-2 dated 24.07.1975 under Section 161 Cr. PC in DIR Case, PS Kotwali,
Bhagalpur No. 50/71 75, (viii) Ex.PW-2/L, which is a statement under Section
164 Cr. PC of PW-2 recorded in this case on 16.08.1975 and 18.08.1975 by the
court of Sh. R.D. Aggarwal, the then Ld. ACMM, Delhi, and (ix) Transcriptions
Mark-Z and Mark-1 of alleged tape- recorded statement of PW-2 dated 30.09.1978
at Danapur Jail between PW-2 and the Jailor. The defence has mainly confronted
PW-2 in his lengthy cross-examination with his statements, which were recorded
prior to his making his confessional statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC on
16.08.1975 and 18.08.1975 in this case and tape-recorded statement dated
30.09.1978. The statement Ex.PW-2/DD was recorded on 24.07.1975 and
25.07.1975, when he was arrested in Bhagalpur case vide FIR No. 71/1974. This
is a cyclostyled copy. Ex.PW-2/DK is a handwritten copy of statement under
Section 161 Cr. PC recorded by the IO dated 24.07.1975 in DIR Case of PS
Kotwali, Bhagalpur in case NO. 50/71 75. Ex.PW-2/DB is the copy of the
statement dated 10.08.1975 under Section 161 Cr. PC in A.N.
    Ray's case.            Ex.PW-2/DE is a statement dated 09.08.1975 under
    CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.                                        Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 181 Section 161 Cr.
PC in Samastipur Bomb Blast case. These four statements Ex.PW-2/DD,
Ex.PW-2/DK, Ex.PW-2/DB and Ex.PW- 2/DE of PW-2 are thus recorded by the police
officer much before confessional statement by PW-2. Ld. Defence Counsel have
confronted these statements to PW-2 in order to project that there are
improvements in the statement of the approver and hence his testimony is not
believable. Here it is profitable to refer Section 161 of Cr. PC. Under sub-
section 1 of Section 161, Investigation Officer or designated police officer
may examine orally "any person" supposed to be acquainted with the facts and
circumstances of the case. Under sub-section 2, "such person" shall be bound
to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such
officer, other than the questions, the answers to which would have a tendency
to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. PW-2 was an
accused in DIR case, PS Kotwali case, A.N. Ray's case and in the present case
and as such, he could not have answered the questions of the police
officer/investigation officer, being incriminatory. Admittedly, such statement
of PW-2 had not led to any discovery of any fact or article, within the
meaning of Section 27 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Under Section 145 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872, a "witness" may be cross-examined as to his
previous statement made "by him" in writing or reduced into writing and
relevant to the matter in question, without such writing being shown to him or
being proved. It is relevant that while understanding the scope of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 182 confrontation/cross-examination of a "witness" (not an accused),
the statements may be put to him without showing to same to him. It is very
much necessary to understand that all the statements of PW-2 at Ex.PW-2/DD,
Ex.PW-2/DK, Ex.PW-2/DB and Ex.PW-2/DE recorded by the police
officer/investigation officer, after arrest of PW-2 in the capacity of a
suspect and an accused. Therefore, these statements do not stand in the same
footing and definition of a "witness" as laid down under Section 161 of Cr.
PC, so that they may be confronted in cross-examination under Section 145 Cr.
PC. At the time of recording these statements, he was not a witness of the
prosecution. At the time when PW-2 made these statements before the police in
Bhagalpur case or in DIR Bhagalpur case or in A.N. Ray's case or in the
present case, he was not knowing that he would be granted pardon one day and
that might be the reasons for some omissions in those statements under Section
161 of Cr. PC. In this regard, reference can be given to a judgment of Apex
Court in Madan Mohan Lal vs. State of Punjab 1970 (2) SCC 733 and relevant
Para 8 reads as under:-
> "There was also nothing to show that the approver in his statement before
> the Magistrate, who passed the order granting him pardon, had not mentioned
> the names of the appellant and the said Danesh Kumar and had not referred to
> the roles played by them as deposed to by him in the Trial Court. It was
> possibly because no such omission was found CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
> Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 183 in his
> statement before the Magistrate that the refusal by the Trial Judge to bring

Therefore, the defence could not have confronted PW-2 with these statements
Ex.PW-2/DD, Ex.PW-2/DK, Ex.PW-2/DB and Ex.PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 184 2/DE. Even otherwise, the improvements thus pointed
out by the learned Defence Counsel by referring the same are explanatory in
nature, though per se the same could not be looked into under law. The
statements Ex.PW-2/DD, Ex.PW-2/DB, Ex.PW-2/DE, Ex.PW- 2/DK and Ex.PW-2/L are
available in R-43. Ex.PW-2/DA is available in R-30. Ex.PW-2/DC is available in
R-32. Ex.PW-2/DF is available in R-56).
85\. There is yet another statement of Vikram (PW-2), which was tape-recorded
by the Jailor Haider Ali of Danapur Jail on 30.09.1978 and transcription
whereof are Mark-Z and Mark-Z-1, which were filed on behalf of State of Bihar
by their counsel during the trial before my Ld. Predecessor. Subsequently, the
cassette in which the conversation of Vikram was tape-recorded is also placed
on record. The tape was played in the court and PW-2 Vikram admitted his voice
in the cassette, however he has explained in his detailed cross-examination
that he used to be tortured by the Jailor and Doctor D. Ram of the Jail and
police officers of CID Bihar. He has also explained that he was given a
prepared statement and on their asking he was made to rehearse of speaking
from the prepared statement under coercion. He has also explained that he had
written letters to CBI and CJI. However, one inland letter Ex.PW-2/DG and two
letters written on the pages of a notebook Ex.PW-2/DH and Ex.PW-2/DJ have been
placed on record in original along with the envelopes. These letters are sent
to DSP, CBI, New Delhi informing them of the torture meted out to CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 185 him and to pressurize to make a statement blaming CBI of the
torture, which led him to become an approver. The ld. Defence Counsel also
confronted PW-2 with this statement. The Ld. Special PP argued that this
statement has not been owned by PW-2 in his cross-examination and has
explained that it had been obtained under coercion and pressure by the
officers of CID. Admittedly, in this case the charge sheet was filed by the
prosecution on 12.11.1975 and the conversation with PW-2 with Jailor was
recorded in the tape on 30.09.1978, when the matter was sub judice before the
court of CJM, Patna. I have dealt with this issue in detail in later part of
the judgment and found that Vikram was made to read from a prepared statement
under coercion. Even otherwise, he could not be confronted with this
statement, which was tape-recorded on 30.09.1978 in view of the law laid down
by a three Hon'ble Judge's Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case State
of N.C.T. of Delhi Vs. Mukesh, (2013) 2 SCC 587, holding therein that "From
the scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act, it appears that
the investigation and the materials collected by the prosecution prior to the
filing of the charge sheet under Section 161 of Cr. PC are material for the
purposes of Section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872. The expression "previous
statements made" used in Section 145 of the Evidence Act, cannot, in our view,
be extended to include statements made by a witness, after the filing of the
charge-sheet.....". The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case has relied upon its
illustrious judgment of a Bench of six CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 186 Hon'ble Judges in
Tahsildar Singh and Ors. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1959, SC 1012,
wherein it was held that "previous statement" would be such statements as made
during the investigation". In the present case, when the charge sheet had
already been filed on 12.11.1975, the subsequent statement dated 30.09.1978,
which was obtained under coercion, cannot be put to the witness i.e. approver
PW-2 in his cross-examination to confront him. In view of the above, the net
result of such of the improvements, omissions or clarifications obtained
during the cross-examination of PW-2 are nugatory and of no consequence.
86\. To corroborate the testimony of PW-2 about his posting in the printing
press at Jaipur, Prosecution has examined certain witnesses and it would be
profitable to refer the same. This will corroborate the deposition of PW-2
Vikram that he was part and parcel of Anand Marg organization and remained
posted in printing press of Anand Marg Organization of Jaipur from the year
1972 to June 1974, thereafter again came to work at Delhi Press, met A-1 and
was a privy to the crime and he made a true disclosure of the facts in his
deposition in this court.
87\. It is seen from the cross-examination that the accused instead of trying
to demolish the deposition of this witness, strangely posed certain questions
which are nothing but repetition of examination in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 187 chief
which solidifies the testimony of PW-2 as regards the subject in discussion.
88\. PW-2 further testified that he opened an account with Union Bank of India
at Jaipur in the name of Vikram Kumar only vide application Ex.PW-2/G which
bears his signatures at points A, B & F. He also identified his signatures at
point "F" on the specimen signature card Ex.PW-2/H of the said bank. Even this
fact is not shattered in the cross examination and the same is corroborated by
documentary evidence.
89\. PW-61 Sh. Kesri Singh, an officer of Union Bank of India deposed that in
August 1973, he was posted as officer of Union Bank of India at Jaipur and in
June 1976, he was Branch Manager at Johari Bazaar Branch of Union Bank of
India at Jaipur. On 9.6.1976, he handed over documents i.e. Saving Bank
Account Opening Form and Specimen Signature Card of SB a/c no. 2638 Ex.PW-2/G
and Ex.PW- 2/H respectively of Vikram Kumar to the CBI officer vide Seizure
Memo Ex.PW-61/A which bear his signatures at point A. In his re- examination
at Page No. 1076, he deposed that he also handed over copy of entries in the
SB A/C no. 2638 to CBI officer on 9.6.1976, which is Mark PW-61/A and his
signatures are at point A which are Ex.PW-61/B. In his cross-examination,
PW-61 testified that neither he had seen Vikram nor he knew him. He would not
be able to identify Vikram. The account was not opened in his presence. He
admitted that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 188 the word "attested" or "true copy" are not
written on Mark PW-61/A. He denied the suggestion that he did not supply Mark
PW-61/A to CBI officer or that this fictitious copy was supplied later on. The
testimony of this witness gets corroborated with the documentary evidence. He
was examined only to prove that an account of the organisation stood in the
bank at Jaipur to corroborate the evidence of PW-2 who worked in Jaipur press
of the organisation. The result of cross-examination that he is unable to
identify Vikram in no way helps the defence, since the prosecution is not
depending on the evidence of this witness for the purpose of identification of
PW-2. The purpose of examining the witness is only to strengthen the testimony
of PW-2 that he opened an account in the name of organisation.
90\. PW-84 Sh. J.S. Bhagaria, Inspector, CBI deposed that in June 1976 he was
working as Inspector CBI at Jaipur Branch. On 09.06.1976, he went to Union
Bank of India, Jaipur and met Sh. Kesri Singh (PW-61) and prepared correct
seizure memo Ex.PW-61/A in respect of documents Ex.PW-2/G and Ex.PW-2/H which
were taken in possession from Sh. Kesri Singh. He had also taken into
possession a true copy of the statement of account from Sh. Kesri Singh which
is Mark PW-61/A. In his cross-examination, PW-84 denied the suggestion that
these are bogus and fabricated documents.
91\. Seizure Memo dated 09.06.1976 Ex.PW-61/A by which original Account
Opening Form and Specimen Signature Card of SB Account CBI Vs. Santoshanand

(PW-61), Branch Manager, Union Bank of India, Jaipur). This is available in
Folder R-12. Ex.PW-2/G is Account Opening Form in respect of Account No. 2638
dated 08.08.1973 in the name of Mr. Vikram Kumar, Anand Printers, Jaipur
submitted to Union Bank of India, Jaipur. This bears the signatures of Vikram
Kumar (PW-2) at point B/Mark-H. PW-2/G reflects that Sh. Gopal Dass having
account No. 1358 introduced Vikram Kumar. This is available in Folder R-
4\. Ex.PW-2/H is the Specimen Signature Card of this Account No. 2638, which
bears the signatures of Vikram Kumar at point Mark-K. It is also mentioned
thereon this account was closed on 18.12.1973. This is available in Folder
R-4. Mark PW-61/A is the copy of the Statement of Account No. 2638 in the name
of Vikram Kumar of Anand Printers issued by the Manager of Union Bank of
India, Jaipur for the period from 08.08.1973 to 18.12.1973. It is mentioned
thereon that this account was closed on 18.12.1973. It bears signatures of PW-
61 at Point A as also at Point Ex.PW-61/B. This is available in Folder R-12.
92\. PW-2 further testified that he opened an account in Jaipur Central Co-
operative Bank vide application form Ex.PW-2/E in the name of Vikram Kumar and
one Tara Chand Jain bearing his signatures at points A & B and that of Tara
Chand Jain at point C. He also identified his signatures at point A on the

December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 190 Card Ex.PW-2/F and that of Tara
Chand Jain at point B. The account was opened in the name of Anand Printers.
93\. PW-63 Sh. D.K. Maharishi testified that in June 1976, he was working as
General Manager, Jaipur Central Co-operative Bank Limited, Jaipur. On
8.6.1976, some officer of CBI came to make enquiry regarding account in the
name of 'Vikram Kumar' operated during the year 1972-73. On his direction,
Branch Manager brought the Account Opening Application Forms, which included
one account of Anand Printers operated by Tara Chand and Vikram Kumar. A
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-63/A was prepared and it bears his signatures at point A.
The CBI officer took three documents i.e. Accounts Opening Form, Specimen
Signature Card and Original Resolution of Anand Printers Ex.PW-2/E, Ex.PW-2/F
and Ex.PW-2/N respectively into his possession. He (PW-63) made his correct
endorsement at Point A on these three documents. He also testified that Sh.
Sat Narain Bhukhmariya was Branch Manager and Sh. Bhukhmariya had worked under
him (PW-63) from 1963 to 1978. At that time, he had seen him writing and
signing and identified his signatures on copy of statement of account Mark
PW-63/A at points Ex.PW-63/B-1 to Ex.PW-63/B-6. In his cross-examination,
PW-63 has denied the suggestion that the police forged the documents
Ex.PW-2/E, Ex.PW- 2/F and Ex.PW-2/N. He deposed that he could not identify

99\. On material particulars, the statement of PW-1 and PW-2 find further
independent corroboration by the deposition of PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar

the year 1962 and became whole time worker in the year 1965 and Anand Murti
gave him name as Aacharya Advetanand Avadhoot and he was designated as Chief
Training Secretary of Sewa Dharam Mission at Varanasi. He deposed that he was
also sent to Jaipur in Proutist Federation of India (PFI), a wing of Anand
Marg. He was also posted in Delhi as Secretary of PFI at its office C-18,
South Extension Part-1, New Delhi and thereafter in D-41, South Extension
Part-1 and accused Santoshanand was the Editor of Hindi "Prout" and residing
in the office at D-41, South Extension Part-1, New Delhi. He also identified
accused no.1 Santoshanand and deposed that his original name was Ghanshyam
Prasad and accused no.1 was working under him. He also identified accused no.
3 Ranjan Dwivedi since accused no. 3 used to visit their office in South
Extension Part-1 and was in their organisation. He further deposed that Vikram
used to work in the press at Ranchi and from there he brought him to Delhi. He
had imparted training to Vikram at Varanasi and after training at Sewa Dharam
Mission Training Centre, Varanasi, Vikram was sent to Printing Press, Ranchi.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ

A, B & F and Ex.PW-2/H at point K.
100\. In his cross-examination, PW-68 has denied the suggestion of the defence
that Anand Margies gave him severe beatings. However, he deposed that Anand
Murti who had asked him to establish 191 Printing Press all over India gave
him beatings. He was given beatings on two or three times, as he could not
complete the establishment of 191 Printing Presses. To a question by the
defence that he was given beatings a number of times, to which PW-68 replied
that he was given beatings two or three times. He testified that sometimes
Anand Murti used to give him beatings on hands and sometimes on his hips with
a stick. He (Anand Murti) also used to give beating to the others, who were
not in a position to carry out his orders. Anand Murti used to have a Danda
(stick) with him, which he used to take out from the almirah by asking them to
spread their hands and sometimes on their hips. He has denied the suggestion
of the defence that he left Anand Marg because of giving beatings to him by
Anand Murti. They used to address Mrs. Anand Murti as Marg Mata. Her name was
Mrs. Uma Sarkar. He admitted the suggestion of the defence that she had
defected from Anand Marg. He was not aware if Mrs. Uma Shankar had organized a
parallel organization. He CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 197 addressed a press conference in
the presence of Marg Mataji and he did not call Mrs. Uma Shankar there. He did
not join any procession at boat club but self-immolation took place to press
for release of Anand Murti. He deposed that there was no editorial board and
his name did not appear as editor on the paper published from D-41, South
Extension, Part-I, New Delhi, but his articles did appear in the magazine with
his name. He has denied the suggestion that he was never in this organization
or that he never lived or worked at D-41, South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi,
that he embezzled or stolen the funds of the organization. He has also denied
the suggestion that he did not know Vikram or that he had not seen him writing
or signing, or that he has deposed at the instance of CBI and due to hatred
towards the organization of Anand Marg or that for that reason he had wrongly
identified the signatures of Vikram. In his further cross- examination, he
testified that he did not have any quarrel with Santoshanand Avadhoot or
others residing in D-41, South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi, before he left.
He was having cordial relations with Santoshanand Avadhoot and others during
his stay at D-41, South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi. Santoshanand and others
did not give him any threat during his stay in D-41, South Extension, Part-I,
New Delhi. He has denied the suggestion that he has wrongly identified the
writing of Santoshanand.
101\. PW-68 has identified the writing and signatures of PW-2 on these bank
documents Ex PW-2/F at point A, Ex PW-2/E at point B & CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 198
C, Ex PW-2/J at point A & B, Ex PW-2/K at point A & B, Ex PW-2/G at point A, B
& F and Ex PW-2/H at point K and thus it corroborates the statement of PW-2
that he was sent to Jaipur in a press of Anand Marg Organization namely Anand
Printers. He opened 3 different bank accounts at Jaipur with three different
banks i.e. Jaipur Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., Jaipur, Mercantile Co-
operative Bank Ltd. Jaipur & Union Bank of India, Jaipur. However, Vikram
Kumar (PW-
2) has opened the account in Jaipur Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. with
another Anand Margi Sh. Tara Chand Jain, who has been examined by the defence
as DW-8.
102\. While dissecting the evidence of the above witness PW-68 in the backdrop
of the cross-examination conducted, it is very clear that this witness was a
member and a close associate of the founder Anand Murti. The cross examination
itself concretizes the case of prosecution about the Anand Marg, its wings,
the rude behavior of its founder and the participation of PW-2 in the
organisation. The cross-examination never could backlash the deposition of
PW-68 that he was associated with the organisation. Further, it gets
solidified that PW-68 was assigned with the task of establishing 191 Printing
Presses of the Organization throughout the length and breadth of the country.
He was unable to achieve those targets. He was also being caned by the cult
head. The line of cross-examination shows that the founder head was treating
him badly. The line of cross-examination does not go to demolish that this
witness had a close acquaintance with the writings CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 199 of
approver PW-2 Vikram and accused Santoshanand. The defence only gave
suggestions that he was not aware of the writings of these two persons, but
the defence in their very cross-examination got elicited that he was
associated with the organization and that he was given beatings by the founder
head. The defence could not shake the testimony of PW-68 with regard to his
posting in Sewa Dharam Mission at Varanasi or at Ranchi or at D-41, South
Extension, Part-I, New Delhi. The line of cross-examination manifestly assures
that this witness was closely associated and knew the bickering between the
cult head and his wife. Such was the intimate association as is elicited by
the defence. In fact, the defence went to put counter and contrary suggestions
to this witness. After careful scrutiny of the testimony of this witness, this
court finds no reason to disbelieve his testimony as regards his association
with Anand Marg, his knowledge with regard to the founder and the objects of
Anand Marg, its activities like printing the propaganda material, its various
wings and particularly his knowledge and acquaintance with regard to
handwriting and signatures of accused Santoshanand and approver PW-2, who were
working with him in the organization particularly and specifically in at D-41,
South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi and with Vikram at Sewa Dharam Mission
Centre of the Organization at Varanasi.
103\. The testimony of PW-2 finds further corroboration from the deposition by
defence witness DW-8 Sh. Tara Chand Jain. Therefore, this court finds
appropriate to mention what has emerged in his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 200 deposition.
The defence has examined DW-8 Sh. Tara Chand Jain in their attempt to persuade
this court to disapprove testimony of approver Sh. Vikram (PW-2) that he was
working in Anand Marg Printing Press at Jaipur and was having accounts in
three different banks there. However, on the other hand DW-8 Tara Chand Jain
himself also corroborated the statement PW-2. It comes out from his statement
that he was a member of Anand Marg even in the year 1971-72 and as a Sevadar
he used to serve food and medicine for the under privileged. He also remained
Bhakti Pradhan of Anand Marg of Jaipur. There was a press under the name and
style of M/s. Anand Printer, which used to be run by Anand Marg. Sh. Vikram
Kumar, Anand Margi was posted as a Press Manager there at his (DW-8) request.
He stayed there for about two and half years i.e. almost up to 1974\. There
used to be a bank account of the printing press, which used to be operated by
him along with Vikram Kumar (PW-2) in Central Cooperative Bank, Jaipur. After
Vikram Kumar (PW-2) joined the press, it went under the losses and at the
orders of Centre, he removed him after October 1974. At the time of removal of
Vikram Kumar (PW-2), there was no money in tha t bank account. It has come in
his cross-examination that he joined Anand Marg in 1962 as a full timer. The
first bank account of the organization was opened in the year 1972 in Central
Co-operative Bank after Vikram Kumar (PW-2) came to Jaipur. He admitted his
signatures on the document Ex.PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 201 2/E and PW-2/F. He admitted the suggestion that the
account could have been operated by him and Vikram Kumar under joint
signatures.
104\. Thus, the testimony of DW-8 Sh. Tara Chand Jain further corroborates the
testimony of the approver Sh. Vikram (PW-2) in material particulars. Though
DW-8 has spoken about terminating the service of Vikram Kumar, yet he could
not find any document in support of his deposition. He has testified that
Vikram has worked with him for two and a half years up to the end of year
1974. He also testified that he removed him from the service after October
1974. The Prosecution has examined PW-63, PW-76, PW-61, PW-83, PW-84 and PW-79
only to corroborate the testimony of Approver Vikram (PW-2) that he remained
posted from 1972 to June 1974 in the printing press of Anand Marg Organization
at Jaipur. During his tenure in Jaipur, he opened three bank accounts with
three different banks and one of the accounts he opened jointly with Sh. Tara
Chand Jain (DW-8). The argument of the learned Defence Counsel that no
resolution of Anand Marg Society was annexed with Account Opening Form or that
these were the personal bank accounts of Vikram falls to the ground in the
light of the deposition of PW-2 Vikram Kumar corroborated by their own witness
Sh. Tara Chand Jain (DW-8). Thus, the depositions of PW-63, PW-76, PW-61,
PW-83, PW-84, PW-79 and DW-8 corroborate the testimony of Approver Vikram
(PW-2) that he remained posted from 1972 to 1974 in the printing press of
Anand Marg Organisation, Jaipur. In a way, the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 202 deposition
of DW-8 not only suggests that testimony of PW-2 to be truthful but also
confirm that PW-68 is also a reliable witness. At the cost of repetition, it
is worthwhile to reiterate that PW-68 has identified the handwriting and
signatures of Approver Vikram (PW-2) on various before-mentioned documents and
also of accused Santoshanand on his writings.
105\. The depositions of approvers PW-1 and PW-2 also find independent
corroboration from the statement of PW-33 Sh. Ujjawal Prakash. PW-33 testified
that he joined Anand Marg at Bhagalpur in the year 1957 when he was a student.
He joined service with M/s. Tata Iron and Steel Company in January 1960 at
Jamshedpur, and in the year 1966 on asking of Anand Murti, he resigned. He
deposed that there was Angika Samaj wing of Prout. In January 1970, he was
sent by Anand Murti as Office Secretary of PBI, Delhi. He remained there up to
October 1971. There was an Office of PFI (Proutist Forum of India) a wing of
Anand Marg at D-41, South Extension, Part-1 and "Prout Daily" and magazine
"Education and Culture" used to be published from this place and accused No.1
Santoshanand was the Editor of this newspaper "Prout". The original name of
accused Santoshanand was Ghanshyam Prasad and name of his father was Narinder
Narain Verma. Sh. Narinder Narain Verma used to work in LIC and was also a
Journalist with Vishwabandhu, a daily paper published from Patna. Sh. Prabhat
Ranjan Sarkar/Anand Murti was the founder of Anand Marg, who propounded the
theory of Progressive CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 203 Utilization Theory commonly known
as PROUT and he created five wings to propagate his theory which are BSS
(Bishav Shanti Sena) (2 nd name Volunteer Social Service), ERAWS, PFI
(Proutist Forum of India), PBI (Proutist Block of India) and SDM (Sewa Dharam
Mission). He identified accused Santoshanand in the court and stated that he
used to meet Santoshanand and he saw him in Maha Chakra at Patna. He also
identified accused no.2 Sudevanand in the court and stated that he was Deputy
Chief Secretary, North Region of PBI. He also identified PW-2 Vikram and
stated that he used to sell the publications as a full time Anand Margi. He
also identified accused Gopalji. He stated that he can identify accused Ranjan
Dwivedi and counsel for accused Ranjan Dwivedi stated that he does not
challenge/dispute his identity. (Meaning thereby had Ranjan Dwivedi been
present in the court he would have been identified by PW-33).
106\. In his cross-examination, the version of PW-33 is never shattered as
regards his joining Anand Marg at Bhagalpur in the year 1957 as a student or
that there was Angika Samaj wing of Prout. All the other aspects of his
different capacities in the organization, the wings of the organisation, its
publications, the role of A-1 as the Editor of "Prout" at D-41, South
Extension-I, New Delhi, his capability to identify to PW-2, A-1, A-2, A-3 and
A-7 goes unrebutted. The deposition of this witness that A-2 was the Deputy
Chief Secretary, Northern Region of PBI and his competence in identifying him
are also not shattered in the cross-examination. The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 204 cross-
examination failed to destabilize the say of PW-33 as regards the father of
A-1 having worked with LIC as well as a Journalist for "Vishwabandhu". The
defence has tried to extract full address of his shop where he was carrying
the business of clothes and PW-33 declined the request of the learned Defence
Counsel for security reasons.
107\. However, PW-33 deposed that he was having his shop at Patna as well as
in Delhi. Then the witness on asking of the learned Defence Counsel declined
to give the names of his children for security reasons. In fact, by making
such bone testing cross-examination as regards the address of the witness and
children (as on the date of deposition) throws a clumsy situation giving room
to different interpretations including the mal-intentions of the accused, when
the defence chose to cross-examine without questioning the identity of the
witness.
108\. The statements of both approvers PW-1 and PW-2 have been further
independently corroborated by the statement of PW-11 Sh. Raj Singh. He deposed
that in the year 1967, he took Diksha of Anand Marg from one Aacharya Lallan
Singh at Delhi and in that connection, he used to visit North Avenue for
attending Dharam Chakra for doing Sadhna. Sh. Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar used to be
called Anand Murti as well as Baba and Tarak Brahma and he had Darshan of Baba
at 93, North Avenue which was the residence of Sh. Shashi Ranjan, MP, in CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 205 the year 1970. He (PW-11) testified that he was
residing at D-29, Ward No.1, Mehrauli, New Delhi and his residence was at an
isolated place adjoining abadi. On the other side of his residence, there was
jungle and graveyard and for this reason, Avadhoots used to come to his
residence to do kapalik Sadhna during amavas nights and for such Sadhna, the
Avadhoots used to have a bag containing human skulls and some daggers as
sadhna used to be done in jungle. He also testified that preaching of Anand
Marg was to establish a Sadvipra Samaj i.e. the rule of moralist. He deposed
that their preaching's included worshiping truth, observation of celibacy and
regular sadhna/prayer and they called only those persons as moralist, who were
primarily Anand Margies and were strictly following a moral code. PW-11
further deposed that he knew accused Santoshanand present in the Court since
the year 1968-1969 (correctly identified). During those days, accused
Santoshanand was working as an Editor of Prout of Anand Marg, which was
published from premises No. D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and that
the said accused used to come regularly to his residence for Kapalik sadhna.
He had also seen Vikram as he used to be present at D-41, South Extension
Part-I, (New Delhi), whenever he went there.
109\. In his cross-examination, PW-11 admitted the suggestion of the defence
that he made a statement before the Magistrate since he was assured of
protection by the CBI. He deposed that he was assured of protection by Sh.
Puri of CBI. He testified that in the year 1973, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 206 police
came to his house once or twice to enquire about Santoshanand in connection
with self-immolation of Dineshwaranand as to whether Santoshanand visited his
house and he replied in the negative. Police visited him one or two days after
self-immolation by Dineshwaranand to find out whether Santoshanand was present
in his house or not. He did not know at that time whether Santoshanand was a
Proclaimed Offender. He was unaware of any Sanstha (Society) by the name of
PBI. He however knew about one paper "Prout" being published by the
organisation. He was aware of a training institute at Banaras. He deposed that
the persons working in the press used to live in the upper premises. It is
Vikram, Santoshanand and one Dada @ Deen Dayal apart from the others, were
working in the Press. Vikram used to deliver "Prout" at his place and
sometimes he himself used to collect it. Avadhoots generally used to visit his
house at Mehrauli even prior to 1973. From 1967, Avadhoots used to visit his
house almost regularly every Amavas night for Kapalic Sadhna. Between 1973 &
1974, after self-immolation by Dineshwaranand, one or two Avadhoots visited
his house. He did not visit D-41, South Extension Part-I during this period.
He was also not getting "Prout" paper regularly. The defence has not disputed
the version of PW-11 that he had been a Anand Margi and his residence was
situated at Mehrauli where Avadhoots including accused Santoshanand used to
come frequently for doing Sadhna. His competency to identify A-1, A-3 and PW-2
was never derided by the defence.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 207
110\. The evidence of PW-11 is in consistence with the testimonies of PW-33
and PW-68, which material particulars gets corroborated with the testimony of
PW-2. The defence instead of shattering the consistent and coherent testimony
of this witness only had redrawn the entire examination-in-chief. From the
opening lines of the cross- examination, it is felt that the defence wanted to
project that this witness is tainted since he met certain CBI officers. It
should be borne in mind that their very cross-examination suggests that this
witness had sought protection considering the gravity of the charges against
the accused. The defence has utterly failed to establish that this witness is
tainted or tutored or inimically disposed towards the accused.
111\. PW-13 Sh. Shiv Raj deposed that he has been an Anand Margi since 1964,
when he took Diksha from Aacharya Deepanand. He joined as Research Assistant,
Shimla and came to Delhi in September 1972 for obtaining Ph.D. degree and
stayed in the Hostel of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (PUSA), New
Delhi until 29.05.1975. Aacharya Santoshanand Avadhoot used to visit him and
at that time, he used to sport long hair, beard and mustaches and he used to
be in attire of Avadhoot. He also used to wear hearing aid. (This witness has
correctly identified accused Santoshanand in the court by pointing towards
him). In those days, Santoshanand was editor of paper Prout published from
D-41, South Extension Part I, New Delhi. He also deposed that Anand Murti was
in jail and Santoshanand used to tell CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 208 about the
philosophy of Prout. Santoshanand used to say something should be done to get
Anand Murti released.
112\. In his cross-examination, PW-13 replied that office of Anand Marg is
situated at D-41, South Extension Part-1, New Delhi only. He came in contact
with Santoshanand after coming to Delhi and very much impressed from his
talks. He met accused Santoshanand for the first time in October 1972 in Delhi
in the Hostel. Prior to that, he knew Santoshanand only by his name and he had
not seen his face. He was introduced to him by his two friends namely Sh.
Ranbir Singh and Sh. Kamal Dhari, while they were sitting in the room of Kamal
Dhari. PW-13 further deposed that Santoshanand continued visiting them in the
Hostel between January 1973 and April 1973.
113\. The deposition of PW-13 that he had been an Anand Margi since 1967 or
that he shifted to Delhi in 1972 and residing in hostel or about posting of
A-1 as Editor of Prout at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi or visit of A-1
to PW-13 in his saffron attire and appearance of a mendicant or his competency
to identify PW-13 are not shattered in his cross-examination by the defence.
His cross- examination elicited reiteration of the facts deposed by the
witness.
114\. PW-34 Jagat Ram Dogra was the Junior Instructor, ITI, Indore (MP) and he
joined Anand Marg in the year 1967. He deposed that he was given Diksha by
Aacharya Visheshwaranand (PW-1) in the year CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 209 1967\. PW-34
identified PW-1 Visheshwaranand @ Madan Mohan Srivastava in the court, and
stated that in the year 1973, PW-1 came to him and enquired whether he could
arrange arms and ammunitions. He (PW-34) replied that he would see to it in
case of need. At that time, PW-1 gave him Rs.400/- to purchase pistol or
revolver. PW-1 came to him in the month of August 1973 in plain dress, though,
earlier he used to meet him in Bhagva dress. PW-1 again came to him after 15
or 20 days and he enquired whether he (PW-34) could make arrangement of the
arms or not, to which he replied in negative. PW-1 demanded back his money
from him. He (PW-34) had already spent the amount and he assured PW-1 that he
might leave his address and he would send the amount by money order. Later on,
he sent back the amount by money order.
115\. In his cross-examination, PW-34 asserted that he stopped active
participation in Anand Marg somewhere in 1974. He admitted the suggestion of
the defence that he lost faith in Anand Murti Ji after coming to know about
his arrest in the newspapers. He could not remember the date, month and year
of the arrest of Anand Murti Ji. He testified about attending one "Dharam Maha
Chakra" but could not remember its date, month and year. He was not able to
differentiate between Aacharya and Avadhoot, but stated that the word
"Aacharya" is used with an Avadhoot. He was detained in MISA in the year 1975
from Jabalpur, but he could not remember the date and month, when he was
detained. At that time, there was ban on CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 210 Government
servants joining Anand Marg. He was released from detention under MISA in the
month of January 1977. His statement was recorded by CBI two or three days
prior his detention under MISA. He has denied the suggestion that he was
released from detention under MISA only on giving promise that he will stick
to his statement, which he gave to CBI. He has denied the suggestion that he
was not attending the office since August 1975. He admitted the suggestion of
the defence that the Magistrate recorded his statement on 26.09.1975. He
replied that he was arrested in the evening of 26.09.1975 after sunset. He has
denied the suggestion that Aacharya Visheshwaranand is an agent of CBI or that
he did not have any meeting with him or that he did not have any talk with him
or that he (PW-1) did not give him (PW-34) Rs.400/- or that he (PW-34) did not
send back this amount to him (PW-1). This witness denied the suggestion that
PW-1, who was present in the court is not the Visheshwaranand. He testified
that he did not tell CBI in his statement (u/s. 161 Cr. PC) that he could
identify Aacharya Visheshwaranand or that he was given Diksha by the said
person. (When PW-34 was confronted with his previous statement Ex.PW34/DA, it
was not found recorded). He deposed that he was not given any other name while
taking Diksha.
116\. This witness (PW-34) has been examined by the prosecution to prove the
identity of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava as Visheshwaranand of Anand Marg and
PW-34 has specifically deposed CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 211 that Visheshwaranand had
given him Diksha in the year 1967. During his deposition, he clearly
identified PW-1 as Visheshwaranand @ Madan Mohan Srivastava. In his cross-
examination, the defence failed to discredit that PW-34 is not an Anand Margi
or PW-34 did not take Diksha in the year 1967 from Visheshwaranand. PW-34 has
also been examined by the prosecution to prove its case that pursuant to the
criminal conspiracy hatched at Trimohan in October 1973 on the terrace of the
house of Ram Kumar (Proclaimed Offender), PW-1 had visited Indore and
contacted PW-34 Jagat Ram Dogra for arms and paid him Rs.400/-, PW-34 could
not arrange the revolver and on demand he promised PW-1 to send the amount by
money order. Seven or eight years have already elapsed, when the statement of
PW- 34 was recorded in the court and simply because PW-34 could not file the
postal receipt of sending the amount of Rs. 400/- by money order to PW-1 or
could not tell the date and month, does not ipso facto make his statement not
worthy of acceptance. The defence has failed to point out any enmity or
malafide intention as to why PW-34 shall make a statement, which is not found
convenient to them. Even if he could not make in his previous statement that
he could identify PW-1, it cannot be called an improvement, as it is inherent
to identify him in the circumstances when PW-34 had taken Diksha from PW-1 in
the year 1967 and they continued to meet even subsequently.
117\. The argument advanced by the Defence Counsel that the testimony of PW-34
is not creditworthy springs from two points CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 212 namely that
the PW-34 has not made the statement before the Police under Section 161 of
Cr. PC as regards his ability to identify PW-1. Further, they pointed out that
this witness had improved his version while in the witness box without any
reference to his statement already given to the investigation. The improvement
pointed out by the Defence Counsel is not fundamental insofar as he was able
to say in his statement that he was initiated by PW-1 into Anand Marg and who
in turn subsequently approached him for securing armed weapons. The defence
has not even suggested in the cross- examination that PW-1 was not initiated
into Anand Marg. In the absence of such a suggestion, it should be inferred
that without knowing the person and further without identifying, nobody would
initiate an unknown, especially into a spiritual order as that of Anand Marg.
Having thus initiated the person and having dealt with him, which is not
demolished in the cross-examination, mere identification of PW-1 in the court
cannot be called an improvement and it only supplants the fact of initiation
into the spiritual order. I have already discussed that no personal enmity is
imputed against this witness by the defence. Thus, the improvement does not go
to smash the entire version of the investigation, which is otherwise
corroborated through other circumstantial evidence.
118\. The other improvement pointed out also does not sound to reason insofar
as it confines to this witness repaying a sum of Rs.400/, which he allegedly
had taken from PW-1 since the repayment is not at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 213 all a
fact in issue to be considered for the purposes of unraveling the truth
concerning the charges. This improvement pointed out is only peripheral in
nature and only surrounding a shadow which is unconcerned with the charges,
this court is unable to sail with the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel that
these improvements would strike at the very root of prosecution story.
119\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. P.C. accused Santoshanand admitted that he
is an Anand Margi. He stated that there was no office of Anand Marg at D-41,
South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi, but was of "Prout" and he was sometimes
the Editor thereof. He also admitted that Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti
used to be called as "Baba" being the founder of Anand Marg Organisation. He
further admitted that Anand Murti propounded the theory of "PROUT". He stated
that the founder was considered by his followers as 'Tarak Brahma' that is God
incarnate like Krishna and Shiva. He also stated that there were different
cadres of Anand Margies, namely, whole timers, Aacharya, Avadhoots and Anand
Margies. He admitted that he was editor of the monthly magazine 'Education and
Culture' and at that time 'PROUT' was a weekly and not a daily magazine. He
only denies that D-41, South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi was used as office
of Anand Marg and ground floor was used for printing press, first floor was
used for editorial purpose and Anand Margies used to stay at Anand Marg Ashram
situated at Hari Nagar and Anand Margies used to stay there. He also admitted
that he was working in Delhi as Editor CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 214 of English and
Hindi Prout. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi while answering under Section 313 Cr. PC
stated that dozens of Sanyasis of Anand Marg used to stay at D-41, a three-
storey building and Dharam Chakra used to be conducted on the 1st Floor of the
building which he attended few times. However, Ranjan Dwivedi could not say
whether Santoshanand used to reside at D-41, South Extension Part II, New
Delhi permanently.
120\. It is established from the testimony of Approvers PW-1 and PW-2 that
"Prout" has been a wing of Anand Marg Organization. This fact has also been
corroborated by PW-11, PW-13, PW-33, and PW-
68\. It has also come in the testimony of PW-2 that Santoshanand used to live
at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and there was printing press on the
ground floor and office of Proutist Forum of India on the first floor. It is
also established from their deposition that first floor building was also used
for boarding and lodging. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi also used to live in this
building for 2 or 3 days or sometimes only for two hours. The statement of
PW-68 on the point that Santoshanand, Editor of Hindi "Prout" and of English
"Prout" Weekly was residing in the office D-41, South Extension Part-I, New
Delhi, went unrebutted and unchallenged by the defence. Thus, the explanation
of Santoshanand becomes not satisfactory.
121\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. PC accused Sudevanand stated that he is a
follower of Anand Marg. He admitted that Prabhat Ranjan CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 215
Sarkar @ Anand Murti was also called as 'Baba' being the founder of the Anand
Marg Organisation. He stated that this was his personal faith and reverence
for Anand Murti as 'Tarak Brahma' i.e. God incarnate like Krishna and Shiva.
He stated that he does not know his co-accused Santoshanand, Arteshanand,
Gopalji and Ranjan Dwivedi and did not see Santoshanand before facing trial
and saw Gopalji when he was arrested and never saw Vikram before his arrest.
He stated that he never visited Samastipur. These explanations are highly
unbelievable in view of the coherent testimony of PW-1, PW-2, PW- 11, PW-13,
PW-33 and PW-68, who had been long associated with the organisation.
122\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. P.C. accused Ranjan Dwivedi stated that he
did not belong to Anand Marg Organisation and he is only a disciple of Anand
Murti. He also stated that he has been a lawyer of Anand Marg Parcharak Sangh
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. When asked about different wings of
Anand Marg Organisation like PFI, VSS, PBI, ERAWS, he stated that he does not
have personal knowledge about details of various wings of Anand Marg Parcharak
Sangh. He stated that only the office of 'PROUT' was located at D-41, South
Extension, Part-1, Delhi from where daily magazine 'PROUT' was published and
Santoshanand was Editor of the magazine. He admitted that Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar @ Anand Murti, who was called the 'Baba', was the founder of Anand Marg
Organisation. He admitted that Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar propounded the theory of
progressive CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 216 utilization. He further admitted that
Anand Murti was considered by his followers as 'Tarak Brahma'. He stated that
he never participated in any of the Dharam Maha Chakras. When asked about
different cadres of Anand Margies namely (1) Whole timers (2) Aacharya @
Avadhoot & (3) Anand Margies, he stated that he has been simply an initiate
and had never been a member of Anand Marg Parcharak Sangh or its cadres. He
admitted that on becoming Avadhoot, one had to wear loongi, kurta, turban of
saffron colour and had to sporting long flowing beard and moustaches and carry
a kirpan in his hand. He admitted that few times he visited D-41, South
Extension, Part-1 for attending Dharam Chakra. He stated that dozens of
Sanyasis of Anand Margies used to stay at D-41, a three-storey building and
Dharam Chakra used to be conducted on the 1st Floor of the building which he
attended few times. He stated that he could not say whether Santoshanand used
to reside at D-41, South Extension Part II, New Delhi permanently. While
replying question no.201, he admitted that he used to visit Anand Marg office
at D-41, South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi. He further stated that after he
developed inclination towards Anand Marg philosophy, he used to attend their
spiritual congregations known as Dharma Chakra as and when invited by them. He
stated that he started visiting the this place at New Delhi in the year 1973
when he shifted to Delhi. A close look of his explanations manifestly makes it
clear that this witness has been dilly- dallying to reveal the truth. At
times, he shows ignorance with regard CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 217 to the cadres to
the Anand Marg, while admitting the founder and at one time, he denies having
attended the congregation as a follower and at the next breath admits having
attended Dharam Chakra (congregation). He admits the hierarchy among the monks
of Anand Marg but blissfully shows his ignorance at the next moment. Thus, his
explanations for the evidence appearing against the accused on record are
highly improbable to assimilate.
123\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. PC accused Gopalji stated that he is an
Anand Margi. He never knew Santoshanand, Arteshanand and Sudevanand before his
arrest and he never met Vikram. He also stated that Anand Marg is a very big
organization and does not know about other wings. He also admitted that
Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti used to be called as 'Baba' being founder
of Anand Marg Organisation and he was considered by his followers as 'Tarak
Brahma' like God incarnate like Krishna and Shiva. He further admitted that
there are different cadres of Anand Marg like whole timers, Aacharyas,
Avadhoots and Anand Margies.
124\. PW-11 Raj Singh has proved the fact that motto of Anand Marg was to
establish a 'Sadvipra Samaj' i.e. rule of moralists who were primarily Anand
Margies and strictly following a moral code. This fact finds admission and
corroboration from admitted writing in the diary Ex.PW-43/Z-6 of accused
Ranjan Dwivedi Q-15-A and on the date of bomb blast at Samastipur on
02.1.1975, the accused Ranjan CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 218 Dwivedi has written the
portion Q-15-A in his said diary Ex.PW-43/Z- 6 which reads as under:-
> The day was fully utilized as an instrument graciously touched by the cosmic
> wave length meeting of sequences.
> O, Baba, you are the Lord of Lords prevalent everywhere and will establish
> your cherished goal of universal 'sadvipra kingdom'.
This writing clearly reflects the views of accused Ranjan Dwivedi while
thanking the Baba (for his divine Powers) which helped him in successfully
arranging access to his co-conspirators Santoshanand, Sudevanand and approver
Vikram to reach the spot of crime at Samastipur on 2.1.1975, which finds
particular reference to the other subject to be discussed in the later part of
this judgment. Suffices to say for the purposes of this subject under caption,
the accused has referred to cult head attributing divinity to him.
14) Boat Club Rally - Self-immolation
125\. In the above backdrop, PW-1 deposed that in the year 1973, while posted
as Principal, Anand Marg Public School at Jabalpur, he was called to Delhi
where a Rally was scheduled at Boat Club in February 1973 to press the release
of Anand Murti from Jail. He deposed that Anand Murti was arrested in a case
of murder of one of his followers who deserted the cult, in the year 1971 and
continued to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 219 be in prison, having lost prayer for bail
up to the Apex Court. Many persons offered themselves for arrest in the Rally.
PW-1 testified that he participated in that rally. He also courted arrest at
the time of rally. Accused no.4 Ranjan Dwivedi also courted arrest at that
time.
126\. In the cross-examination of PW-1, it is elicited that he did not inform
the Magistrate in his statement u/s 164 of the Cr. PC that he joined agitation
for release of Anand Murti and about his arrest in Delhi. He clarified that
Magistrate asked him with regard to the incident at Collectorate, Patna. He
answered that in the year 1973, he remained in Tihar Jail, Delhi for about 10
days and gave his name as Visheshwaranand Avadhoot. He has not been shown Jail
Record by the police that his name was recorded as Visheshwaranand Avadhoot.
At that time Ranjan Dwivedi was also with him in the Jail. It is further
elicited that he did not mention before the Magistrate that Anand Murti was
arrested at Bombay in a Ranchi Bomb case and a rally was organized in Delhi to
pressurize the Government to get Baba released. PW-1 replied that Anand Murti
was firstly arrested in 1971 in Ranchi Bomb case. Then, he was arrested on
29.12.1971 in murder of a defector from the cult. Baba remained confined to
Jail for about seven years.
127\. PW-2 testified that in April 1973, he came to Delhi from Jaipur where a
rally had been organized for demanding release of Anand Murti, who was
confined in Patna Jail. Many persons belonging to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 220 Anand
Marg participated in the rally. Firstly, they had assembled in Parade Ground
opposite Red Fort and from there a procession was taken to Boat Club.
Sudevanand, Ranjan Dwivedi and Santoshanand joined the rally apart from many
other Anand Margies. Some of them were arrested at Boat Club and he himself
was arrested from D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi. At that time, Sudevanand
came from U.P. and many persons were arrested from D-41, South Extension,
Part-I, New Delhi. He remained in jail for one and a half months. When he was
released, Sudevanand was still in Jail. After his release from Tihar Jail in
connection with "April, 1973 rally" in Delhi, he returned to Jaipur and came
back to D-41, South Extension at the end of June 1974.
128\. In his statement U/s 313 Cr. PC, accused Santoshanand admitted that
Anand Murti was arrested in Ranchi Bomb Case and defector's murder case in the
year 1971. He admitted that Anand Murti continued in custody and his bail
application was rejected up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and prayer for
transfer of that case outside the State of Bihar was also turned down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. He stated that in April 1973, a rally was organised in
Delhi not for the release of Anand Murti but to show the protest for
administering poison to Anand Murti in jail.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 221
129\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. PC, accused Sudevanand admitted that Anand
Murti was arrested in Ranchi Bomb case and defector's murder case in 1971 and
continued in prison.
130\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. PC, accused Gopalji admitted that Anand
Murti was arrested by the police in Ranchi Bomb Case and in defectors' murder
case in the year 1971 and he continued to be in prison on that account.
131\. In his statement u/s 313 Cr. PC, accused Ranjan Dwivedi admitted that
Anand Murti was arrested in Ranchi Bomb case. He was also arrested in
defector's murder case, in which Madhavanand was approver. He further admitted
that in February 1973, a rally was organised at Boat Club to put pressure on
the Government to secure the release of Anand Murti. He stated that in the
said rally though he was a spectator and a lawyer, he was nabbed.
132\. Statement of PW-1 and PW-2 about holding of rally in Delhi in
February/April, 1973 to pressurize the government to release Baba finds
corroboration from the testimony of PW-13. The said witness PW-13 deposed that
Santoshanand used to say that something should be done to get Anand Murti
released. There was a rally in Delhi in April 1973 by Anand Margies and he had
joined that rally at the instance of accused Santoshanand to press the
Government to release the Baba. In the cross-examination of PW-13, it is found
holding of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 222 rally was not decided in his room, he was just
informed of it. Santoshanand did not give him any threat to attend the rally.
He (PW13) was of the opinion that they should try to get Baba released by
constitutional means. Self-immolation by Aacharya Dineshwaranand was committed
on the day following the rally in Delhi.
133\. The testimony of PW-13, which corroborates the version of both approvers
PW-1 and PW-2, is also corroborated by explanation tendered by accused Ranjan
Dwivedi in his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC when he admitted that rally
was organized at Boat Club to put pressure on the Government to secure the
release of Anand Murti. Juxtaposing this consolidated testimony, the
explanation offered by accused Santoshanand in his statement under Section 313
Cr. PC that rally was intended to protest not only for poisoning his cult head
in the jail but also for pressurizing his release is only to mislead this
court.
134\. PW-1 has further deposed about self-immolation by the cult members of
the Anand Marg Organization. He knew that Divyanand Avadhoot and
Dineshwaranand Avadhoot have committed self- immolation for release of Anand
Murti at Patna and Delhi respectively. PW-2 also testified that he knew
Dineshwaranand as he used to visit at D-41, South Extension-I, and
subsequently Dineshwaranand self-immolated at Purana Qila, New Delhi. PW-2
deposed that when he visited again at the above address, he came to CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 223 know that police was searching for Santoshanand after self-
immolation by Dineshwaranand. He deposed that when Santoshanand met him in the
market, he told PW-2 that he was aware that the police was after him in the
case of above self-immolation of Dineshwaranand.
135\. PW-50 Sh. R.L. Bhagat, Advocate testified that in the year 1974, he was
working as Additional Public Prosecutor in Parliament Street Court. He used to
appear before the court of Sh. M.K. Chawla, Ld. Additional Sessions Judge,
Delhi. He has seen the file of Sessions Case No. 116/1974 "State Vs. Aacharya
Puniyanand & Others" under Section 306/120-B IPC vide FIR No. 209 dated
24.04.1973, PS Tilak Marg, Delhi, decided by the said court on 07.04.1975. He
testified that Santoshanand and another were Proclaimed Offenders in this
case. Santoshanand did not appear throughout the trial of the case. Sh. Ranjan
Dwivedi, Advocate used to appear in the said case. He identified the accused
Ranjan Dwivedi, present in the court. Despite opportunity, PW-50 was not
cross-examined by the defence. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement u/s 313
Cr. PC further admitted that Divyanand Avadhoot and Dineshwaranand Avadhoot
self-immolated in Patna and Delhi respectively in the year 1973 not only for
release of Anand Murti but also against the gross injustice and atrocities
perpetrated by the Government and the jail authorities. He also admitted that
in the case of self-immolation by Dineshwaranand Avadhoot, a case vide FIR
No.209 dated 24.4.1973 was registered CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 224 against his co-
accused Santoshanand, who was declared a Proclaimed Offender. He admitted that
he was Defence Counsel and Sh. K.L. Bhagat was the Prosecutor in the court.
While replying Question No. 124, he also admitted that Dineshwaranand
committed self- immolation at Purana Quila, New Delhi and Santoshanand was
declared a Proclaimed Offender. He was defending Puniyanand and Gunadishanand
in self-immolation case. In his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC accused
Ranjan Dwivedi while replying Question No. 66 stated that he did not know
accused Santoshanand prior to his arrest and he met him for the first time in
jail after his arrest in this case. While replying other questions he also
stated that Santoshanand used to reside in D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi.
While answering question no. 366, Ranjan Dwivedi stated that he was instructed
to appear for Santoshanand and make pairvi in self- immolation case then being
conducted at Parliament Street Court, but he does not recall meeting him since
at that time he was hiding as an accused and was later acquitted. He also
stated that he used to write him at times being helpful as a lawyer and also a
fellow Margi. While replying question No. 251, he stated that at the instance
of Sh. Ram Tanuk Singh, Advocate and the legal secretary of the Anand Marg he
started taking up their cases in Delhi and in this connection he used to visit
D-41, South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi. PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar also
testified in his cross-examination that there were CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 225 self-
immolations by some members of Anand Marg to press the release of Anand Murti.
136\. Testimony of PW-1 and PW-2, if read along with testimony of PW-11, PW-13
and PW-68 coupled with the explanation given by Ranjan Dwivedi, would
definitely leads one to conclude that Dineshwaranand committed self-immolation
in the year 1973 inside Purana Quila, New Delhi.
137\. It is thus established that Anand Margies did hold a rally at Boat Club,
New Delhi to pressurize the government to release Anand Murti/Baba. It has
come in the testimony of PW-1 that this rally was organized at Boat Club New
Delhi in the month of February 1973. However, PW-2 deposed that this rally was
held in the month of April 1973\. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi states that this
rally was held in the month of February 1973. An FIR No. 209 dated 24.04.1973
PS Tilak Marg under Section 306/120-B IPC was registered against Santoshanand
and others. This fact of registration of FIR because of self-immolation by
Dineshwaranand is also admitted by accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement
under Section 313 of Cr. PC. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi had stated that this FIR
was registered on 24.04.1973 against Santoshanand who was declared a
Proclaimed Offender. Since Dineshwaranand committed self-immolation, the day
following the rally as stated by PW-11 and accordingly an FIR was registered
on 24.04.1973, it has to be concluded that the rally was CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 226
organized at Boat Club New Delhi to pressurize the Government to release Anand
Murti from jail in the month of April 1973.
15) Rally at Patna and gherao of Abdul Gaffoor
138\. The evidence of PW-1 does not help in any manner to render a finding
that there was a Rally at Patna or about gherao of Abdul Gaffoor, CM of Bihar
during 1973 since he deposed that he was not present.
139\. The testimony of PW-122 Sh. L.P. Tiwari, a Police Inspector PS Kotwali,
Patna, reflects that in July 1973, on 26.7.1973, an entry Ex.PW-122/A was made
in the Station Diary concerning the proposed procession of Anand Margies. He
also deposed that in his presence on 26.7.1973 an order of SDM, Patna U/s. 144
Cr. PC was received, which is also incorporated in Station Diary Ex.PW-122/B.
He further deposed that on 27.7.1973, a procession of Anand Margies started
from Dinakar Community Hall and the police escorted 400 Anand Margies wearing
saffron clothes, who were raising slogans like JAIL KA PHATAK TUTEGA - ANAND
MURTI CHHUTEGA and others. He further deposed that R.P. Sharma, SI was deputed
at the residence of Chief Minister, Bihar. On 28.7.1973 at about 06.00 AM, he
was informed that 500/600 Anand Margies surrounded the residence of Chief
Minister, Bihar. He along with Sh. M.P. Dubey and others rushed to the
residence of the Chief Minister, Bihar and found Anand Margies squatted there
in large number at the main gate. They were CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 227 not
permitted by police to go inside. He also stated that Anand Margies were
carrying banners, Bhalaajs, Lathies and Pharsas at the other gate. Sh.
Nagender Tiwari, SDM took three representatives of Anand Margies to the CM,
who heard them.
140\. He further deposed that the persons present outside the residence of the
CM attempted forcible entry to the residence and the SDM warned them of
promulgation Section 144 Cr. PC, directed them to disperse, but to no avail.
SDM declared their assembly unlawful and protestors started brick bating, used
Lathies, resulting in injuries to Constables. 38 Anand Margies were arrested
and a case No. 68 dated 28.7.1973 was registered with PS Kotwali, Patna vide
FIR Ex.PW-122/D.
141\. In his cross-examination, PW-122 Sh. L.P. Tiwari answered that it would
not be possible for him to identify any one from amongst those 39 persons
arrested in that case No. 68 dated 28.07.1973 of PS Kotwali Patna, due to
lapse of time. He stated that original of Ex.PW- 122/D must be in the FIR
register. In his statement to CBI Officer (U/s. 161 Cr. PC) he had only
referred the residence of Chief Minister, without giving the name of Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor as Chief Minister. He has denied the suggestion that he intentionally
introduced the name of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor as Chief Minister at the instance of
CBI officers. He stated that in his statement to CBI officers, he informed
that Anand Margies were raising the slogans "JAIL KA PHATAK TUTEGA -
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 228 ANAND MOORTI CHHUTEGA". When the attention of the
witness was drawn to his statement Ex.PW-122/DA (u/s. 161 Cr. PC), he admitted
that there is no mention of this slogan specifically and reference was only to
rising of emotional slogans. He has denied the suggestion that he has
intentionally introduced this fact at the instance of CBI. His version that
SDM took three Anand Margies to the Chief Minister, who gave them a patient
hearing and asked them to meet him in his chamber in the Secretariat at about
10.30 AM, was not found recorded in his statement under Section 161 Cr. PC.
142\. In his cross-examination, the defence has not demolished the fact of
incidents on 26.07.1973, the procession of Anand Margies, conversance at the
CM residence, promulgation of Section 144 Cr PC and consequent registration of
the case. The deposition of this witness PW-122 further corroborate the
prosecution case that prior to criminal conspiracy in question, there were
demonstrations, rallies, protest and self-immolations by Anand Margies to
pressurize the government to release Anand Murti from the Jail, who was
arrested in the murder of a defector.
16) Formation of Revolutionary Group
143\. PW-1 deposed that he knew Vinayanand Avadhoot even earlier and he was
the Principal of Anand Marg Primary School at Banaras and Rudranand Avadhoot
was a senior worker of Anand Marg. He testified that at Patliputra, he and
Vinayanand discussed and expressed CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 229 dissatisfaction
about working of seniors Asimanand and Keshavanand, as they could not secure
release of Anand Murti from jail. They met Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot, who
told them that all peaceful measures or methods to get Anand Murti released
had failed and plan to form a Revolutionary Group had been prepared. He
deposed that aim of this Revolutionary Group was to get released Anand Murti
by violent means, holding rallies and self-immolations. He deposed that
Rudranand told them that all those who were creating obstructions in release
of Anand Murti were enemies of the Organisation and they were immoralists and
deserved to be liquidated. He also stated that on persuasion of Rudranand,
both of them (PW-1 and Vinayanand) joined the Revolutionary Group. Rudranand
advised them to resign from the Organization because in case of their arrest,
it would bring a bad name for the Organization and Anand Murti. As such, they
resigned from the Organisation by applications addressed to the General
Secretary, Anand Marg by July 1973. Rudranand advised them to discard saffron
attire and get their beard and moustaches shaved and long hair cut-short, and
revert to plain clothes. Rudranand rechristened him as "Vijay" and Vinayanand
as "Jagdish". He testified that real name of Vinayanand was Ram Mohan. They
acted as per instructions of Rudranand, who also told them that Aacharya Ram
Aasrey (Proclaimed Offender) has also joined the Revolutionary Group. He knew
Gopalji prior to that as they both used to attend VSS Camp. Gopalji was Store
Keeper at VSS Camp. PW-1 further testified that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 230 he
himself, Vinayanand (Proclaimed Offender), Arteshanand, Sudevanand,
Santoshanand, Tyageshwaranand and Ram Kumar (Proclaimed Offender) went to
Bhagalpur. At Bhagalpur, near Janta Library, they met Gopalji at his house.
There, Santoshanand told PW- 1 that there was one Saroj Kumar Biswas at
Bangaon and he (PW-1) should go and bring arms and ammunitions from him.
Santoshanand gave him a letter addressed to Saroj Kumar Biswas. Santoshanand
then talked to Gopalji in presence of all of them that all the arms and
ammunitions collected shall be kept at the house at Chautham. Santoshanand
also told Gopalji that for the release of Anand Murti, a Revolutionary Group
had been formed and it has been resolved that some persons were to be put to
death and so, arms and ammunitions was to be collected and kept at his house
at Chautham. Gopalji was also a staunch worker of VSS. At that time, Gopalji
informed them that their meetings would take place at both places at Chautham
and at a farmhouse belonging to him situated across River Kosi. At that time,
he himself, Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Tyageshwaranand
and Ram Kumar were present.
144\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 replied that he had narrated before the
Magistrate that the aim of the Revolutionary Group was to secure release of
Baba by violent means like rallies and self- immolations. He stated before the
Magistrate u/s 164 of Cr. PC that Budheshawaranand @ Tyageshwaranand told him
that house of Gopalji at Chautham would be appropriate as meeting place or CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 231 informed that Gopalji had come to Bhagalpur. (The
witness was confronted and this was not found recorded in his statement Ex.PW-
1/X about coming of Gopalji to Bhagalpur). He replied that as far as he
remembered, he had stated in his statement u/s 164 of Cr. PC that in the
presence of all of them Accused Santoshanand told Gopalji that all the arms
and ammunitions collected by them shall be kept at his house at "Chautham".
(When confronted with his previous statement Ex.PW-1/X, the name of the
"Gopalji" and "house" were not found mentioned). He had not stated in his
statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC that Santoshanand told Gopalji for
release of Anand Murti, a Revolutionary Group had been formed or that some
persons were to be put to death. He answered in his cross-examination that his
name was rechristened as "Vijay" from the day he joined the Revolutionary
Group.
145\. The comprehensive and careful analysis of the evidence as regards the
formation of Revolutionary Group is to be appreciated as a backdrop or the
genesis leading to the conspiracy alleged by the prosecution. There is no
other angle by which this can be understood other than the backdrop of events
leading to the hatching of conspiracy at Trimohan in October 1973. There is no
formal charge of forming Revolutionary Group but the backdrop is clearly
stated by the Prosecution by adducing the evidence of PW-1 which is discussed
above. The line of cross-examination does not discredit certain members having
avowed to secure the release of their cult head being CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 232
not satisfied with the efforts under the process of law and thereby to look
for alternate ways. The evidence of PW-1 suggesting that he along with
Vinayanand met Rudranand, who in turn informed them about necessity of
formation of a Revolutionary Group for which a plan was being prepared, is not
discredited in the cross-examination. What is highlighted by the defence with
regard to the improvements found in the evidence of PW-1 are only the minor
details. Those minor details revealed in the testimony of PW-1 are like the
discussions to adopt violent means, the details of Gopalji being the VSS Camp
worker and further that Budheshawaranand suggesting the proper place to meet
thereafter at Chautham. Such details are bound to appe ar in the deposition
while any witness makes statement in the temple of justice by not suppressing
anything connected with the facts in issue. Few details being not found in the
statement under Section 164 Cr. PC but appearing in the testimony, do not
severe the roots of formation of Revolutionary Group. The defence could not
dismantle the evidence of PW-1 as regards the formation of the Revolutionary
Group and the improvements highlighted are mere explanations, which do not
touch the material particulars. Therefore, these improvements cannot be termed
as dismantling the case of prosecution.
146\. PW-2 deposed that in the hostel room of PW-13 in last week of June 1974,
Santoshanand told him that Sudevanand, Arteshanand and Budheshawaranand had
already joined the Revolutionary Group and discarded their saffron robes of
Avadhoot and they were dressing CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 233 themselves like common
man. PW-2 on asking of Santoshanand went to Bhagalpur and delivered a packet &
a letter in envelop to Budheshawaranand. PW-2 testified that one Sukhdev Sahu
(PW15) had rented a room where Budheshawaranand was living with him and he
stayed in that room for 8/10 days and after 1 or 2 days, Budheshawaranand
brought him to Chautham at the house of Gopalji and met him and he correctly
identified him in the court. He did not know him prior to that. At a distance
5 or 7 KM, Gopalji had a farmhouse at Tilihar. Budheshawaranand introduced him
to Gopalji as a confident and devoted member of Revolutionary Group and he
himself was introduced to Gopalji as a member of Revolutionary Group and that
he had been sent there by Santoshanand. He came back to Bhagalpur with
Budheshawaranand after staying for one day at Chautham.
147\. In the cross-examination of PW-2, it is found that there was no
requirement to resign from the membership as Revolutionary Group was the part
of Anand Marg Organization. It is further revealed that their Baba was
confined in Jail. In order to get him released, a Revolutionary Group was
formed and Santoshanand told them that by eliminating the big personalities of
the Government i.e. Ministers and Smt. Indira Gandhi, the Government would be
perplexed and they would be able to secure release of Baba. Thus, the cross-
examination only fortifies that say of this second witness also about the
formation CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 234 of Revolutionary Group and the accused could not
elicit anything to discredit him.
17) A-1, A-2, PW-1 & PW-2 turning incognito.
148\. PW-1 deposed that after taking Diksha as Avadhoot in the year 1965, he
donned the prescribed dress of a Monk in saffron colour, wore lungi, kurta,
turban and sporting long beard and mustaches and grown long hair, carried a
kirpan. In the last week of July 1973, Rudranand persuaded him and Vinayanand
to be Revolutionaries and having acted upon his advice, both discarded the
attire and appearance of a Monk and took to plain clothes, rechristened them
as "Vijay" and "Jagdish" respectively. Rudranand also informed them that
Aacharya Ram Aasrey (Proclaimed Offender) had also joined the Revolutionary
Group. He further testified that Arteshanand Avadhoot and Sudevanand Avadhoot,
present in the court, were found present in plain clothes at the house of Ram
Kumar when PW-1 visited his house at Trimohan along with Vinayanand and
Shankaranand. PW-1 had seen them in saffron robes earlier. PW-1 further
testified that when he returned from Indore and came to Trimohan, after 2 or 3
days, Santoshanand came there and he was not sporting beard and long hair and
before that, he had seen him only as an Avadhoot (with saffron clothes etc.)
as he is identified in the court with the same saffron robes and appearance.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 235
149\. PW-34 went on to depose that PW-1 Aacharya Visheshwaranand, who had
given him Diksha in the year 1967, came to him in 1973 and enquired whether he
could arrange for arms and ammunition and at that time, he (PW-1) paid him Rs.
400/- for purchase of pistol or revolver. PW-1 visited him in August 1973. He
was in plain dress at that time, though, earlier he used to be in Bhagva dress
(Saffron Attire). In his cross-examination, PW-34 testified that he did not
inform CBI that Aacharya Visheshwaranand used to wear Bhagva Clothes since no
question was asked about it. The defence did not dispel the testimony of PW-34
in his cross-examination that PW-1 visited him in plain dress in the month of
August 1973 and prior to that, he used to see him in Bhagva dress (Saffron
Attire). Therefore, the testimony of PW-34 is reliable.
150\. PW-2 also testified about initial attire of Santoshanand. Accused
Santoshanand used to attire in the same dress in which he appeared in the
Court. The witness stated that Santoshanand used to sport a long beard, grown
long hair, wore saffron colour turban, saffron kurta and tehmad and waist
band. He further deposed that after one or two days of his reaching here
(Delhi), Santoshanand met him in the market of South Extension, Part-1 in the
end of June 1974. At that time, he (PW-2) was wearing kurta-pyjama and
sporting long hair, beard and moustaches. However, at that time, Santoshanand
was wearing pant & shirt (discarding the saffron clothes). He (Santoshanand)
got his haircut short and his beard was shaved.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 236 Santoshanand was putting a hearing aid in his ear.
Santoshanand called him initially and he identified his voice and met him. He
recognized him as he used to wear the hearing aid while working in the
printing press at South Extension. Santoshanand asked him as to how he (PW-2)
had come to Delhi and he (PW-2) replied that Jaipur printing press was not in
working order and so he was working on the printing press at South Extension.
Then, Santoshanand told him that there were so many persons to work at the
press but they wanted reliable persons for the release of Baba. He (PW-2) told
him that he (PW-2) had sacrificed his life for the Baba and would be prepared
to do anything for his sake. Santoshanand asked him to meet him the following
day in the morning at the gate of Pusa Institute. Next morning at 8 O'clock,
he reached the gate of Pusa Institute where he found Santoshanand and one Shiv
Raj (PW-13) standing there. All the three went to hostel room of Shiv Raj.
Shiv Raj (PW-13) left for his office. At that time, Santoshanand told him that
it was difficult to get Baba released by legal means and so many rallies and
self- immolations had been resorted to which had no effect on the Government
and the only way left was armed revolution by which they would shake and
compel the Government to release Baba. Santoshanand also advised him to get
his long haircut short and beard shaved so that nobody should be able to
recognize him that he was a Anand Margi. Santoshanand at that time also told
him that henceforth, he would be called Subir and he himself would be known as
Vinod.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 237 Santoshanand also told him that so far Sudevanand,
Arteshanand and Budheshawaranand had already joined the Revolutionary Group
and they had also discarded their saffron attire as Avadhoot and they had been
dressing themselves like a common man.
151\. PW-2 further testified that Sudevanand also used to appear in South
Extension Building, Delhi in the similar clothes as he was clad in the Court
during evidence when he identified him.
152\. It is found in the testimony of PW-11 Sh. Raj Singh that Santoshanand
used to visit his residence regularly for doing Sadhna. After self-immolation
by Dineshwaranand in the year 1973, Santoshanand stopped coming to his
residence for one year. Thereafter, in April 1974, he came to his house at
about 10 or 11 PM. At that time, he was wearing a plain shirt and pant. He was
not attired in saffron clothes. At that time, he was clean-shaven. He had no
long hair. It took some time for him to recognize him as earlier he had seen
him in saffron attire with long beard. Santoshanand earlier used to wear
hearing aid and on that night, when Santoshanand took out his hearing aid and
fixed it in his ear, he could recognize him. He deposed that thereafter,
Santoshanand came to him on 7th or 8th March 1975. Again, he along with
Accused Sudevanand and Vikram (PW-2) came to his residence on 19.3.1975 and
they were in plain clothes i.e. pant & shirt.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 238
153\. In his cross-examination, PW-11 replied that he did not ask Santoshanand
in April 1974, when he visited his residence as to why he got cut his long
hair and why was he not wearing attire of Avadhoot. He did not ask him as to
where he was, what his source of livelihood was, or whether he had left Anand
Marg. He did not tell him that police visited his place to make enquiry about
him. He informed Sh. Ahuja (I.O.) about visit of Santoshanand in plain clothes
after self-immolation by Dineshwaranand. He had not asked Santoshanand on his
visit on 7/8.3.1975 as to where he was for a year, what his source of income
was or whether he was still in Anand Marg or left it. The defence chose
silence on the facts in issue about the earlier appearance of A-1, A-2 and
PW-2, which was spoken to by this witness in detail. Therefore, testimony of
PW-11 is reliable.
154\. PW-13 Sh. Shiv Raj Singh belongs to village Manturi Distt. Azamgarh
(UP). He took Diksha of Anand Marg in the year 1964 from Aacharya Deepanand
and joined as Research Assistant with Central Potato Research Institute at
Shimla in February 1967. He came to Delhi in September 1972 for obtaining
Ph.D. Degree and stayed there up to 29.5.1975. He was staying in the hostel of
Indian Agricultural Research Institute (PUSA) New Delhi. Aacharya Santoshanand
Avadhoot used to visit him, used to sport long hair, beard and mustaches, used
to be in attire of Avadhoot, and he was using hearing aid. (This witness has
also correctly identified accused Santoshanand in the court). He further
deposed that in those days CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 239 Santoshanand was editor of
paper Prout published from D-41, South Extension Part I, New Delhi and during
those days, Anand Murti was in jail. Further, in his testimony, it is found
that Santoshanand used to tell PW-13 about the philosophy of Prout.
Santoshanand did not visit him after self-immolation by Aacharya
Dineshwaranand after Rally in Delhi in April 1973 for some time and he came to
him in April 1974. At that time, he was not wearing attire of Avadhoot. He had
no beard or mustaches and had his haircut. He was wearing pant & shirt.
Santoshanand came to him in first week of July 1974 and stayed with him. Next
day, they went to Pusa Gate where one person met them. Santoshanand introduced
that person as Vikram. (He identified Vikram in the court.) At that time,
Vikram was having long hair with sporting beard and mustaches. Then they came
to Hostel. Santoshanand & Vikram were talking to each other and he went to
laboratory. He returned to Hostel at about 3-4 PM. when he found Santoshanand
& Vikram in his room but at that time, Vikram was having his hair cut short
and was not having beard. The cross- examination reveals that in April 1974,
when Santoshanand visited him, he did not enquire from him as to why he had
changed the attire of Avadhoot but Santoshanand informed him of his own that
he had changed the dress as he was wanted in self-immolation case.
Santoshanand did not give him any threat when he came to him without sporting
long hair, beard and not in the attire of Avadhoot. He also did not ask him as
to what was his source of livelihood during last CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 240 one
year. On the same lines as that of PW-11, the defence miserably failed to
discredit the testimony of PW-13 on the sworn facts with regard to the change
of attire by A-1 and PW-2. The testimony of PW-13 is not suffering from any
ill-will towards the accused for he has no axe to grind against the accused,
since he was a sympathizer and had even sheltered them at Delhi.
155\. Thus, with the cumulative ocular testimony of PW-2, which is in
consonance with the testimonies of PW-11 and PW-13 and further the deposition
of PW-1 finding corroboration with the testimony of PW-34, it can be safely
said that the accused persons along with PW-1 and PW-2, who were the avowed
monks wearing the prescribed dress in saffron colour with special appearance,
in their zeal to have their cult head enlarged, joined the Revolutionary
Stream by discarding the prescribed vesture in saffron colour and in order to
remain incognito, they changed their clothes, appearance and roamed freely
without being detected by anyone of their past identities.
156\. The motto of the organisation, its founder, various wings, the hierarchy
of the monks, the publishing wing, the arrest of its founder, the zeal of the
hardcore followers to have him released by resorting to several acts, the
formation of revolutionary group and some of the followers turning incognito
to achieve their object, is already discussed above and now I hasten to find
out the evidence on the aspect of collection of arms to achieve their object.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 241
18) Efforts to collect arms and ammunitions.
157\. PW-1 deposed that it was propagated that Anand Murti was seriously ill
only to create an impression in the minds of followers so that they work with
renewed zeal for release of Baba. PW-11 deposed that in his presence, A-1 had
stated that Baba had become very weak in jail and they must make efforts to
get him released from jail. A-1 further told him that it was difficult to get
him freed by lawful means and that is why they should adopt such means to
shake the government. A-1 also informed that he was prepared to sacrifice his
life for it. PW-1 further testified that when Sh. Dogra (PW-34) could not
arrange arms and ammunition, he (PW-1) returned from Indore and came to
Trimohan, where he along with Vinayanand was undergoing training in arms and
ammunition from Ram Kumar. At that time, Shankaranand went away and A-1 came
there after two or three days incognito and at that time also, A-1 told him
that all peaceful methods for release of Anand Murti have failed.
158\. PW-80 Sh. Roop Nath Mishra deposed that he took Diksha as Anand Margi in
1958 from Aacharya Vishvanath Singh, a Veterinary Surgeon at Narkatiaganj. In
the year 1974 about 1 or 1½ month after Dusshera, he met Subir (PW-2) at the
house of Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) at Narkatiaganj. (He identified Subir by
pointing toward Vikram approver in the court.) Subir (PW-2) was introduced to
him by Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) at his residence by saying that he was a CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 242 worker of Anand Marg and Subir (PW-2) expressed his
desire to visit his house. At the house of Paras Nath Singh (PW-27), Subir
told him that Baba would be released only by Kranti (revolution). Subir came
to his house the same day and stayed at his home. Subir (PW-2) also talked to
him that Baba would be got released by way of Sangharsh (revolutionary
struggle).
159\. Cross-examination of PW-80 reveals that without his asking Paras Nath
Singh (PW-27), himself told him that Subir wanted to get Anand Murti released
by adopting illegal means. He suggested Subir that he did not like violence.
He has denied the suggestion that Subir did not meet him at the house of Paras
Nath Singh or that he did not talk to him about release of Anand Murti. He
deposed that Paras Nath Singh was present when Subir was talking about release
of Anand Murti by Krantikari means. He has denied the suggestion that Paras
Nath Singh told him that Vikram was telling him that Anand Murti should be
released by violence (Sangharsh). It has also come in his cross-examination
that at that time Vikram was wearing shirt and pant, though when he saw him in
the court, he was sporting beard and moustaches. Vikram must have been aged
about 22/23 years old, when he met him for the first time.
160\. The defence despite their lengthy cross-examination could not shake the
testimony of this witness. The testimony of PW-80 clearly CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 243
suggests that there were confabulations among PW-2, PW-27 and PW- 80 to the
effect that Baba could be released only by way of armed revolution
(Sangharsh).
161\. PW-13 Sh. Shiv Raj Singh testified that A-1 in his visit in April 1974,
told him that Government was harassing Baba, who could not be released by
adopting constitutional means. A-1 further informed him that some violent
means should be adopted. PW-13 further testified that he declined, as he was a
family man and a government servant. A-1 informed him that they should collect
arms & ammunition but witness did not agree. A-1 used to stay with him in his
room. A-1 came to him in the first week of July 1974 and stayed with him for
the whole night and the next day he along with A-1 went to PUSA gate where one
person met them and he was introduced to him as Vikram (PW-2) by A-1. PW-13
correctly identified approver Vikram (PW-2) in the Court.
162\. In his cross-examination, one finds that PW-13 replied that he was of
the view that they should explore lawful means. He could not remember the date
in April 1974 when A-1 visited him. In the cross- examination of PW-13, the
defence has not even suggested that there were no parleys of violent means
took place between them. The defence has also not derided the version of PW-13
that Santoshanand informed him that they should collect arms & ammunition but
he did CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 244 not agree. I find the testimony of PW-13 could
not be demolished in cross-examination on these points by the defence and the
same calls for taking cognizance at its full value. Even otherwise, the
testimony of PW-13 is reliable and trustworthy from which it comes out that
A-1 has been inciting even PW-13 that violent means be adopted to get the Baba
released; for which they should collect arms and ammunitions and sought his
co-operation.
163\. PW-2 deposed that A-1 incited PW-2 citing his commitment for the cause
and his vow to sacrifice his life for Baba in the context of failure of legal
means. While they met at the hostel room of PW-13, A-1 further incited PW-2
that so many rallies and self-immolations remained futile compelling them to
take up arms. PW-2 stated that he assured A-1 that be whatever the command, he
would do so for release of Baba. Then, at the behest of A-1, PW-2 turned
incognito, took the name "Subir" and A-1 assumed new name as "Vinod".
164\. PW-27, a resident of Indo-Nepal Border, testified that PW-2 informed him
about the fate of Baba, being in jail, the failure of efforts and the only
course left being by revolution and force; to achieve this object, arms and
ammunition and money needed to be collected and requested PW-27 to help PW-2
in this regard. Subir requested him to arrange some arms and ammunition either
himself or through someone but PW-27 expressed his inability and then Subir
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 245 made a request to suggest some other source. PW-27
identified Subir by pointing towards PW-2 Vikram in the court.
165\. In his cross-examination, PW-27 replied that he refused to give any
assistance to Subir, when he initially asked him to help him in arranging arms
and ammunitions. He did not ask him not to talk to him about the matter. On
his next visit, PW-2 again asked him and told him not to talk about the
subject. PW-2 used to make a mention about arranging arms and ammunitions and
every time he used to tell him not to talk in that regard.
165\. A close scrutiny of the statement of PW-27 Sh. Paras Nath Singh reflects
that the defence has failed to erase that Subir (PW-2) informed him that Baba
was in custody and he was to be got released by revolution and by using force.
The defence was unsuccessful to belie his version that Subir asked him to
achieve the object, arms and ammunition and money is to be collected.
Therefore, the testimony of PW-27 goes unrebutted.
166\. The evidence discussed above makes it clear that PW-2 having been
exhorted and incited by A-1, visited Indo-Nepal Border and met PW-27 and PW-80
and other Anand Margies in his efforts to accumulate arms, ammunitions and
money with a mistaken impression that the cult head would be released from
Jail by armed struggle. The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 246 evidence also shows that
PW-2 only has made futile efforts to procure arms from PW-27 and PW-80.
19) Efforts of PW-1 to procure arms
167\. PW-1 sworn to the fact that the house of Prem Kumar, an Anand Margi, was
adjacent to office of PBI at Rajinder Nagar, Patna. Ram Aasrey (Proclaimed
Offender) was living. PW-1 and Vinayanand met Aacharya Ram Aasrey there. One
clean shaven Bengali gentleman was sitting with him and on a wooden rack a
Jhola containing 5 country made bombs was kept. At that time, Gopalji
accompanied with one person came there to meet Ram Aasrey and they talked
secretly and went away. Prem Kumar also came there and Aacharya Ram Aasrey
introduced them to Prem Kumar as 'Vijay' and 'Jagdish'. They stayed in this
house for 2-3 days and during those days, he saw Rudranand and Shankaranand
Avadhoot coming to meet Ram Aasrey and talked secretly. On asking of Ram
Aasrey, he along with Vinayanand and Ram Aasrey came to Arrah. There Ram
Aasrey arranged their stay in Anand Marg Primary School, Arrah and Jhola
containing bombs was with him (PW-1). They stayed for 15 days. Ram Aasrey
arranged separate house for his stay on rent at Arrah in the Bazaar (Market).
Ram Aasrey used to come to meet them in the school, they also used to go to
him, and Aacharya Rudranand and Shankaranand used to come to meet Aacharya Ram
Aasrey at his residence and in the school. They used to talk with Ram Aasrey
beyond their hearing, and Shankaranand talked to him and CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 247
Vinayanand secretly. Shankaranand told him that there were many enemies of
Anand Marg namely Mr. Puri and Hingorani of CBI, Jail doctors and Civil
Surgeon of Patna and Anand Marg defectors namely Aacharya Vishokanand
Avadhoot, former P.A of Anand Murti and Aacharya Anand Kishore. He (PW-1)
asked as to how this could be achieved without weapons. Shankaranand informed
him that one Anand Margi Mr. Dogra, Instructor of ITI, Indore had told him
that in case of need, he would be able to provide arms and ammunitions.
Shankaranand gave him Rs.2, 000/- and asked PW-1 to go to Indore and bring the
weapons. Accordingly, he went to Indore and stayed there for 2/3 days but Mr.
Dogra could not succeed. He paid him Rs. 400/- to Mr. Dogra to procure weapons
and told him that he would collect the same on the next visit. He came back to
Arrah and returned the balance amount to Aacharya Ram Aasrey. He further
stated that Shankaranand came there at the house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan and
asked him to go to Indore and bring arms and ammunitions for which he had
given money to Dogra. He deposed that from Trimohan he came to Arrah and
obtained money from Ram Aasrey, which he returned to him and he went to
Indore. He met Mr. Dogra and Dogra told them that he had not been able to
procure the arms. Mr. Dogra was not having Rs. 400/- with him on hand and he
did not return the money and assured that he would send money to Ram Kumar by
procuring the address from him. PW-1 further testified CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 248
that from Indore he went to Trimohan and narrated the entire facts to
Shankaranand.
168\. It is found in the cross-examination of PW-1 that before the Magistrate
he stated that he took Rs.2,000/- when he went to Mr. Dogra and paid him
Rs.400/-. He did not remember whether he stated the details regarding sending
of Rs.400/- to Ram Kumar or not. PW-1 further replied that he has not given
any description of Bengali Gentleman, who was sitting by the side of Ram
Aasrey (P.O.) in July 1973 except that he was clean-shaven. He did not
remember whether he told the Magistrate that Ram Aasrey (P.O.) did not
introduce him to Bengali Gentleman or not. He did not notice any mark on the
country- made bombs as the same were wrapped in strings. One of the bombs was
of half a kilo in weight. He also did not state in the statement under Section
164 of the Cr. PC that at that time, Ram Aasrey introduced him and Vinayanand
to Prem Kumar as Vijay & Jagdish. He stated that Anand Marg School at Arrah
was up to primary class. He did not state before the Magistrate that he stayed
in Anand Marg Public School in Arrah for 15 days. There were two or three
rooms in the house, which were arranged by Ram Aasrey on the ground floor. He
did not know the names of neighbours but it was situated in the market by the
side of a biscuit factory. He did not know number of that house or name of
biscuit factory. He had stated to the Magistrate that Ram Aasrey lived in a
separate house in the bazaar but had not stated that he had rented a separate
house. He told the Magistrate that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 249 he replied
Shankaranand that there was one Mr. Dogra, an Anand Margi Instructor at ITI
Indore and when he was at Indore, he told him that he would be able to provide
arms and ammunitions in case of need. (When he was confronted with his
statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC, these words did not find the mention).
He told the Magistrate that he informed Ram Aasrey, Rudranand and Shankaranand
at Arrah of his talks with Mr. Dogra. When he was confronted with his
statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr. PC, it was found mentioned that he
informed Shankaranand at Arrah where Rudranand and Shankaranand used to come
to meet Ram Aasrey and talk to him.
169\. A careful scrutiny of the deposition of PW-1 reveals that the line of
cross-examination and the suggestions made by the defence almost proves the
case of the prosecution as regards the examination- in-chief of PW-1 about his
visiting the house of Ram Aasrey, the meeting of several persons including
Gopalji, the storing of arms in the house of Ram Aasrey and the subsequent
instructions, PW-1 had received from Shankaranand to go to Indore and collect
arms from PW-34 of course which effort of PW-1 did not fructify. Therefore,
the material contradictions or improvements, if any as pointed by the defence
go to the oblivion.
170\. This statement of PW-1 is further corroborated by the testimony of PW-34
Sh. Jagat Ram Dogra of Indore. PW-34 has identified PW-1 CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 250
in the court correctly. The defence has given him suggestions only, which was
denied by him. It is a settled principle of law that denied suggestion is no
evidence. The details of the testimony of PW-34 about his role in Anand Marg,
visit of PW-1 for arms and his failure thereof, his returning the money
received from PW-1 to Ram Kumar is already discussed elsewhere and the
repetition is avoided. The say of PW-1 and PW-34 is further fortified by the
deposition of PW-19 Sh. Purshottam Kumar, owner of the Aadarsh Lodge, Indore,
which I intend to deal hereinafter.
171\. PW-1 testified that he stayed in Aadarsh Lodge which was also known as
Gujarati Lodge, twice at Indore. He identified the Register of Visitors
Ex.P-5, entry Ex.PW-1/K and signatures Ex.PW-1/L as "Vijay Kumar" as in his
handwriting regarding his stay on 26.8.1973. While giving his particulars, he
mentioned his name as "Vijay Kumar Prabhat", respecting the sentiments of his
Guru Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar and took his name as surname out of the awe,
reverence and respect towards his Guru. He deposed that at another place he
described his name at Ex.PW-1/M as "Vijay Kumar S/o Prabhatji" and he stayed
there on 10.9.1973 and his signatures are at Ex.PW-1/N as Vijay Kumar. In his
cross-examination, PW-1 has denied the suggestion that the Hotel Register and
Inn-Register are forged documents. He has also denied the suggestion that the
entries did not exist or had been incorporated or interpolated subsequently.
He further replied that he always stayed in the Aadarsh Lodge. He did not
enquire the name of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 251 the manager or proprietor of that
Lodge. He did not know the name of the bearer of that Lodge. He also did not
remember whether adjoining rooms were under occupation or not. He also could
not remember the number of the room, which he occupied. He replied that he
made entire entry in the register in his own handwriting on his first stay
there. He did not remember whether in his second stay/visit, he wrote the
entire entry or only put his signatures against the entry in the register. He
stated that he could say only after seeing the entry. The style of cross-
examination instead of demolishing the deposition of PW-1 rather fortified it
and non furnishing of the details of the owner, bearer, manager, the number of
rooms, location thereof, etc. are all unwanted details since no Lodger would
go to the extent of investigation of such details and naturally would not
remember.
172\. The testimony of approver PW-1 finds further corroboration from the
statement of PW-19 Sh. Purshottam Kumar, owner of the Aadarsh Lodge, Indore.
He testified that his father owns Aadarsh Lodge, Indore. He along with four
brothers has been working in the said Aadarsh lodge with his father and they
have engaged servants at the lodge. He deposed that they have been maintaining
a Register of the Visitors of their Lodge. Sometimes, he makes entries in the
Register, sometimes his father does, sometimes by the visitor himself and
sometimes by the servants. The customer (i.e. visitor) signs the last column
of the entry in the Register. After seeing the Register CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 252
Ex.P-5, he deposed that this is in respect of their Aadarsh Lodge. He proved
the Register Ex.P-5 of Aadarsh Lodge and after perusing the entry dated
26.8.1973 Ex.PW-1/K he deposed that the visitor at Point Ex.PW-1/L has signed
this encircled red portion. He also deposed that the portion A, B and C
encircled with blue pencil in the entry Ex.PW- 1/K is in hand of his father,
which he identified. The portions D, E and F encircled with red pencil in
entry Ex.PW-1/K are in the hand of servant Guman Singh whose handwriting and
signatures he has identified. He identified that portions G, H, J and K
encircled with blue pencil in ExPW1/K to be in the hand of his brother Ramesh.
After perusing the entry dated 10.9.1973 Ex.PW-1/M in the Register Ex.P-5,
PW-19 also testified that this is an entry in respect of one Vijay Kumar in
his hand (PW-19) and the portion encircled with red pencil in Ex.PW-1/M is in
his hand (PW-19). He had obtained the signatures of the customer at that very
time in the last column of the entry. The signatures Ex.PW-1/N were appended
in his presence. The portions encircled with blue pencil and Marked A and B of
this entry are in hands of his father, which he identified. The portion Mark C
and D and encircled with red pencil of this entry are in his handwriting. The
portion E and F are in the hand of his brother Ramesh. Both these entries
Ex.PW-1/K and PW-1/M are in respect of Vijay Kumar and have been signed by the
visitor as "Vijay Kumar" at point Ex.PW-1/L and Ex.PW-1/N. He further stated
that entries in the Register (Ex.P-5) are made as per particulars given by the
visitors.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 253 This Register Ex.P-5 was taken into possession by CBI
on 30.9.1975 vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-19/A. The Seizure Memo Ex.PW-19/A bears
his signatures at point A, that of his brother Ramesh at point B and their
servant Guman Singh at point C. He, Ramesh and Guman Singh at points A, B and
C., also signed the last page of this Register. His brother Ramesh, servant
Guman Singh and he himself signed on the front page of Register at Point B, C
and A respectively. The last but one leaf of the Register Ex.P-5 also bears
his signature at Point A, of Ramesh at Point B and Guman Singh at Point C.
They appended their signatures on 1 st, last and last but one page of the
Register at the time it was taken in possession by CBI. He has identified
signatures of his father, servant, Guman Singh and brother Ramesh since he had
seen them writing and signing. In the Register Ex.P-5, name of the visitor in
the entry Ex.PW-1/K is mentioned as Vijay Kumar Prabhat and in the entry
Ex.PW-1/M as Vijay Kumar Wald Prabhatji and visitor has also signed as Vijay
Kumar on both these entries at point Ex PW-1/L and Ex PW-1/N.
173\. In his cross-examination, PW-19 replied that police recorded his
statement. He informed the police about the entry dated 26.08.1973 in his
statement. (However, when confronted with the statement under Section 161 of
Cr. PC Ex.PW-19/DA any particular about the entry dated 26.08.1973 was not
found recorded). He explained that he had not seen the entry dated 26.08.1973
at the time of taking into possession the Register Ex.P-5 by the CBI. The
marking with red CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 254 pencil on the entry dated 10.09.1973 was
put at the time of taking into possession of the register. He stated that on
the left side of the page of the entry Ex.PW-1/M and PW-1/N there is no
writing in his hand. He admitted that entry Ex.PW-1/M is the last entry on
that page. The entry dated 10.09.1973 was not signed by the visitor in his
presence. He also did not remember whether the customer signed the entry with
his pen or pen of some other person. He did not remember whether he informed
CBI that a portion of the entry was in the hand of his father, brother Ramesh
and a portion in the hand of his servant Guman Singh. He informed the police
that he would be in a position to identify handwriting and signature of his
father, brother Ramesh and Guman Singh, servant. (However, when confronted
with his statement under Section 161 of the Cr. PC Ex.PW-19/DA, it was not
found recorded). He informed the police that he would not be in a position to
identify the visitor connected to the entry. (However, when confronted with
his statement under Section 161 of the Cr. PC Ex.PW-19/DA, it was not found
recorded). He testified that the entry preceding and following entry Ex.PW-1/5
is in the hands of his father. He deposed that a bill book is maintained and
bill is issued only if the customer wants. They did not issue any bill in
respect of entry dated 10.09.1973. However, he asserted that there is mention
of deposit of money in this entry itself. He also deposed that there is
deposit of amount against all the entries on the page and for that reason he
could say that no bill was issued in respect of all those entries. Normally, a
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 255 government servant demands a bill. They do not
maintain books of account of their lodge. However, they have been paying
licence fee for their lodge. He did not know the amount, which was being paid
as licence fee by his father. He could not remember the age of the customer to
whom entry Ex.PW-1/M related. The age of this customer is mentioned in the
entry. He did not sign the page having the relevant entry in this register,
when the CBI took it into possession. He had seen this relevant entry in the
register Ex.P-5 at the time of taking it into possession by the CBI. After
that, he had seen the register on the date of his deposition in the court. He
has denied the suggestion that he has made this entry at the instance of CBI
or that he has been introduced as a false witness. The testimony of this
witness is not discredited if he had informed the police in his previous
statement that he would not be in a position to identify the visitor namely
Vijay (PW-1) which was not found recorded in his previous statement.
Accordingly he did not identify PW-1 in the court. The cross-examination did
not go to unsettle the documentary evidence, which are proved on record and
further corroborated by the oral evidence of PW-1, PW-19 and that of the
police officials, who have seized the same, which discussion follows.
174\. PW-83 Sh. M.P. Sharma, Inspector, has proved Seizure Memo Ex.PW-19/A by
which the Visitor's Register of Aadarsh Hindu Lodge Ex.P-5 was seized. He was
working as CBI Inspector with SIU-II, New Delhi. He testified that on
24.09.1975, Deputy SP Sh. Ahuja, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 256 Investigation Officer of
this case, directed him to go to Indore (Madhya Pradesh) for partly
investigating the case. He was directed by Deputy SP Sh. Ahuja to make
investigation and find out regarding one Vijay Kumar S/o Sh. Prabhat staying
in some Gujrati Lodge at Indore. He was also informed that Gujrati Lodge was
near Bus Stand, Indore. He was directed to verify from the record of that
Gujrati Lodge about the stay of said Vijay Kumar between the period August
1973 and November 1973. Accordingly, he reached Indore on 25th or 26th
September, 1975 and went to Gujrati Hotels and Lodges near Bus Stand Indore.
He visited Aadarsh Hindu Lodge, which was also known as Gujrati Lodge and
check up the entries in the Visitor's Register and found entry in respect of
said Vijay Kumar. Sh. Purshottam Dass (PW-19) was the owner of that lodge from
whom, he took into possession that Register (Ex.P-5) vide Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-19/A. He correctly prepared the seizure memo Ex.PW-19/A and bears his
signature at point D. Sh. Purshottam Dass (PW-19) has also signed at point A,
his brother at point B and one servant at point C in his presence. He
identified the Register Ex.P-5, which he took into possession from Sh.
Purshottam Dass (PW-19) of Aadarsh Hindu Lodge. The first, last and
penultimate page of the Register were signed by him, Purshottam Dass (PW-19)
and two other witnesses mentioned hereinbefore. He identified his signature at
point D on the Register Ex.P-5.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 257
175\. In his cross-examination, PW-83 answered that name Gujrati Lodge is not
written on the Register Ex.P-5. He did not verify from the office of District
Magistrate, whether Aadarsh Hindu Lodge was registered in the same name in
that office. He admitted that there is no serial number in the entries of
Register Ex.P-5. He denied the suggestion that entry in respect of Vijay Kumar
at page No. 21 of the Register Ex.P-5 was inserted subsequently. He admitted
that column no. 1 of the register Ex.P-5 is of serial number. He also admitted
that the portion having serial number on page no. 21 pertaining to entry
Ex.PW-1/A is not there, which got torn off on account of use of the register.
He asserted that this register was in the same condition, when he took into
possession as it is now. He has denied the suggestion that portion of page no.
21 was intentionally torn off in order to insert the entry.
176\. It is to be noted that this witness was cross-examined only on behalf of
accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand. The other accused have failed to cross-
examine the witness despite opportunity. It is to be noted that the line of
cross-examination restricted to the suggestions that this Register Ex.P-5 was
either manipulated/interpolated/fabricated. For every suggestion, the accused
could only draw a negative answer from the witness and the line of cross-
examination does not go to establish that the register is fabricated one and
that the same is an implantation only to help the prosecution. The vehement
answer of the witness that the Register has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 258 been in the
same condition as it was when seized, is elicited in the cross-examination,
which inspires the court to arrive at the finding that the register is not
tampered with in any manner. Furthermore, this witness PW-83 is an impartial
official witness, who had no axe to grind against these accused persons in
manipulating the said Register. The mere non-recording of statements of other
persons to suggest the name of Aadarsh Hindu Lodge, which was known as Gujrati
Lodge, would not discredit the documentary evidence and the credibility of the
witness.
177\. This Visitor's Register Ex.P-5 of Aadarsh Hindu Lodge, Indore is
available in Folder R-5. It is a bound register and duly paginated from Sr.
No.1 to 78 in Hindi numerals. The first relevant entry dated 26.8.1973 at 7.40
AM Ex.PW-1/K is in the name of "Vijay Kumar. Prabhat" in Hindi and he stayed
there up to 27.8.1973. This entry is in the middle of the page no.21 of the
Register and in continuation of previous entries of 25th August 1973 followed
by other five entries of 26th August 1973 and visitor has signed at Ex.PW-1/L
as Vijay Kumar in Hindi. The second relevant entry dated 10.9.1973 at 6.00 AM
Ex.PW-1/M, which is in the name of "Vijay Kumar wald (son of) Prabhat Ji" in
Hindi. He stayed there up to 11.9.1973. This entry is, though a last entry on
page no. 27, the visitor has signed in Hindi in similar manner as Vijay Kumar
at Ex.PW-1/N and this entry is followed by ten more entries of 10.9.1973 on
next page. It needs to be noted upon careful scrutiny of the Register Ex.P-5
that the last column CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 259 on the bottom of every page in
the Register is left blank. This register can be said to have been maintained
in due course of business by the Lodge. This Register was seized after about
two years on 24.9.1975 by the I.O. and entries dated 27.8.1973 and 10.9.1973
appear to have been made in due course of business by the Lodge and do not
suggest at all that these entries were added or substituted at the time of
seizure of register or thereafter. There is no force in the argument on Ld.
Defence Counsel that no witness has been examined to prove that this lodge was
also known as "Gujarati Lodge" as stated by PW-83 Sh. M.P. Sharma and PW-19
Sh. Purshottam Kumar. There is also no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence
Counsel that bills of staying in the Lodge are not filed when entries itself
support stay of PW-1 under assumed name of "Vijay Kumar Prabhat or Vijay Kumar
wald Prabhat." The charges for lodging are reflected against the entries
itself and therefore the question of issuing separate bills for stay in the
Lodge does not arise.
178\. The Ld. Counsel for defence points out that there have been improvements
in the deposition of PW-19 in as much as the witness having not stated before
the police that he is not able to identify the signatures and writing of the
Lodge officials/Managers in the Register Ex.P-5. There is one more improvement
argued with regard to the entry in the Register particularly referring to date
26.08.1973 as the witness having not stated before the police under Section
161 of the Cr. PC. According to the defence, these improvements would render
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 260 the witness unbelievable. I have carefully considered
this submission. Needless to say that the prosecution also wants to connect
the chain of events as regards the stay of PW-1 by his assumed name Vijay,
Vijay wald Prabhat in the Lodge belonged to PW-19. Testimony of PW-19 that one
Vijay stayed in his Lodge under the assumed name as above is not demolished in
the cross-examination. The defence had not objected to marking of the Register
Ex.P-5 through this witness. The defence having not objected to marking of the
Register cannot point out these improvements in the testimony of PW-19 as
prejudicing their case in as much the statement/testimony is only to be looked
into as a connecting ring in the entire chain qua the purposes of proving the
stay of PW-1 at the Lodge. The deposition of this witness cannot be looked in
isolation since the Register maintained at the Lodge at Ex.P- 5 being the
documentary evidence speaks louder than the witness himself. The entries in
the register dated 26.08.1973 are also found recorded in due course of
business of the said lodge. The defence having not objected to marking this
Register and the seizure thereof, having been duly proved as mentioned above,
the statement of PW-83 and PW-126A (whose evidence is discussed in the
succeeding Para) and the document speaking volumes louder than the mere
omissions by the police in recording the minute details as pointed by way of
improvements. Thus, the improvements pointed out by the Ld. Defence Counsel is
mere trivial and does not go to the root of the prosecution in proving the
stay of PW-1 at the said Lodge situated in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 261 Indore,
irrespective of the name of the Lodge whether it was known as Gujrati Lodge or
Aadarsh Hindu Lodge.
179\. Statement of Sh. R.P. Sinha, Inspector, CBI, at its Patna Office was
examined on 15.09.1983 as PW-126. Subsequently, on 30.09.1983 one Sh.
Maheshwar Prasad, Head Assistant, PWD was examined, but he has also been
numbered as PW-126, apparently due to inadvertence and typographical error.
This witness Sh. Maheshwar Prasad is now re-numbered as PW-126A.
180\. Moreover, PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar Prasad has identified the signatures of
PW-1 on the Visitor Register Ex.P-5 as "Vijay Kumar Prabhat" to be in the
handwriting of PW-1. He (PW-126A) testified that in the year 1961, he was
working in the office of SDO, PWD Lahariya Sarai. He knew Sh. Madan Mohan
Srivastava (PW-1), who, in those days was working as Correspondence Clerk in
Darbhanga circle of PWD. In the year 1975, Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava has
worked with him in the office of Superintendent Engineer, PWD, Lahariya Sarai.
He deposed that during this period from 1961 to 1975, he had seen Sh. Madan
Mohan Srivastava writing and signing and for that reason he identified his
writing and signatures Ex.PW-1/L and Ex.PW-1/N in the Visitor's Register
Ex.P-5 (of Aadarsh Lodge/Gujrati Lodge, Indore). It is pertinent to mention
that PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava has put these signatures as Vijay Kumar
Ex.PW-1/L and PW-1/N.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 262
181\. In his cross-examination, PW-126A replied that without seeing the entry
in the register Ex.P-5, he could not say how Madan Mohan Srivastava has
written his name therein and whether he had written his name as Madan Mohan
Srivastava in the register Ex.P-5 and whether the relevant entry in the
register Ex.P-5 was in English or Hindi. He did not remember whether he stated
to the CBI Officer that in the year 1961 Madan Mohan Srivastava was working as
Correspondence Clerk in Darbhanga Circle of PWD. He asserted that Madan Mohan
Srivastava was working under him, when CBI Inspector Sh. N.N. Singh also
called Madan Mohan Srivastava. He did not remember whether he stated to the
Inspector Sh. N.N. Singh that he could identify the writings and signatures of
Madan Mohan Srivastava both in English and Hindi or not. (He was confronted
with the statement under Section 161 of the Cr. PC Ex.PW-126/DA, where the
words "Both Hindi and English" were not found mentioned but the factum
mentioned was that he was acquainted with the writing and signatures). He has
denied the suggestion that the writing and signatures, which he identified to
be in the handwriting of Madan Mohan Srivastava are not in his handwriting. He
testified that he was the Section Incharge and only Madan Mohan Srivastava was
working under him.
182\. The defence did not challenge the identity and posting of PW- 126A in
the cross-examination of PW-126A or that he was working CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 263
with PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava at the same place. The defence has also not
challenged that Madan Mohan Srivastava was not working under the supervision
of PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar Prasad in the office of PWD, Lahariya Sarai. When a
person like PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava was working under the supervision
of PW- 126A or in his office, it is quite natural that such superior gets
acquainted with the writing and signatures of such subordinate like PW-1 Madan
Mohan Srivastava. Thus, the statement of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava has been
further corroborated on material particulars by PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar Parsad
that on two occasions in the month of August, 1973 (26.08.1973) and September,
1973 (10.09.1973), he visited Indore to meet PW-34 Sh. Jagat Ram Dogra for
collection of arms and ammunitions and stayed at Aadarsh Hindu Lodge under the
assumed name of "Vijay Kumar". Therefore, the statement of PW-1 inspires
confidence that he came to Indore at the instance of Shankaranand to collect
the arms and ammunitions from PW-34 Sh. Jagat Ram Dogra on payment twice in
August, 1973 and September 1973 and that he paid Rs.400/- to Sh. Dogra on his
1 st visit.
20) Training in arms by Ram Kumar at Trimohan.
183\. PW-1 also deposed that he along with Vinayanand was asked to go to
Village Trimohan by Shankaranand for being trained in handling the arms and
ammunition at the hands of Ram Kumar, an Anand Margi. Thus, they went to
Trimohan along with Shankaranand. PW-1 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 264 took the jhola
containing bombs with him. They travelled by Upper India Express (train),
which stopped at Kaholgaon, a station ahead of Ekchari. They got down there
and then on foot they reached at the house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan. There
Shankaranand introduced PW-1 as 'Vijay' and Vinayanand as 'Jagdish' to Ram
Kumar. At the suggestion of Shankaranand, the jhola along with bombs was
handed over to Ram Kumar (Proclaimed Offender). He further deposed that
Arteshanand Avadhoot and A-2 were present in plain clothes at the house of Ram
Kumar. PW-1 had seen them earlier in saffron robes. He identified A-2 in the
court also. Thereafter, Shankaranand went away. He further testified that Ram
Kumar trained him and Vinayanand in Judo and use of 12-bore gun. He testified
that Arteshanand and A-2 did not receive this training in their presence as
they had already received this training. He came to know of it during the
course of his training and that of Vinayanand. Ram Kumar imparted them
training regarding extent of energy of country made bomb and how to throw and
handle it. This training was given to all four of them. They also received
practical training. One bomb out of five bombs, which he had brought, was
taken out. They were taken at some distance away from the house and Ram Kumar
gave demonstration as to how to throw the bomb. Then, Ram Kumar gave him that
bomb and he (PW-1) threw it but it did not explode. He directed Vinayanand to
pick it up and threw it. When Vinayanand threw it, it exploded. At that time,
he, Ram Kumar, Vinayanand, A-2 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 265 and Arteshanand were
present. He deposed that they remained at the house of Ram Kumar for about 15
days. Arteshanand and A-2 also stayed there during their stay. He further
deposed that thereafter Shankaranand Avadhoot came there who asked him to go
to Indore and bring arms and ammunition for which he (PW-1) had given money to
Mr. Dogra (PW-34). As such, from Trimohan, he (PW-1) came to Arrah and
obtained money, which he had returned to him. Then he went to Indore and met
Mr. Dogra. From Indore, he (PW-1) came to Trimohan and met Shankaranand who
was still present there and narrated him the entire things. Shankaranand then
went away and after 2-3 days, Santoshanand came there in plain clothes. He was
not sporting beard and long hair and before that, he had seen him only in the
guise of an Avadhoot as he is found at the trial.
184\. PW-1 further testified that A-1 told him that all peaceful methods for
release of Anand Murti have failed. A-1 brought a letter from Aacharya
Rudranand, addressed to Din Pal Rai, Advocate of Azamgarh, who was also an
Anand Margi. He knew Sh. Din Pal Rai, Advocate prior to that since he used to
participate in VSS Camps. In the letter, it was written that the revolver be
handed over to the bearer of the letter. PW-1 further deposed that he came to
Azamgarh with the said letter and met Din Pal Rai, Advocate. He handed over
the letter of Aacharya Rudranand to Din Pal Rai and told him that Rudranand
and Santoshanand were busy in collecting arms. Din Pal Rai informed him that
in case, they are not able to procure arms, he (Din Pal Rai) CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 266 would give the revolver but Din Pal Rai did not give him that
revolver and he came back to Trimohan and reported to accused Santoshanand.
185\. In the cross-examination of PW-1, it is elicited that before the
Magistrate, he stated that Arteshanand and Sudevanand did not receive the
training as they had already received such training but it was not found
mentioned in his previous statement. PW-1 further stated in his cross-
examination that 3-4 bombs used to be exploded for the purpose of imparting
training. PW-1 further testified in his cross-examination that he has not
stated before the Magistrate that he was introduced to Ram Kumar at Trimohan
by his name as Vijay and that Vinayanand was introduced as Jagdish. PW-1
further deposed in his cross- examination that from Arrah, he Vinayanand went
to Trimohan by train. They left Arrah in the evening and at 3.00 or 4.00 A.M.,
they reached at Kaholgaon as the train did not stop at Trimohan. Along with
the Jhola containing the arms, he used to carry another Jhola of his personal
belongings. There was no pin system in the bomb as it was a country made bomb.
PW-1 further replied that house of Ram Kumar was situated on the bank of Ganga
on the roadside. There were houses occupied by the persons in the vicinity of
the house of Ram Kumar. They were staying in the house on the ground floor.
There was a deserted school on the way leading to Ekchari Railway Station and
the bomb was exploded there at a lonely place. This building was at a distance
of one furlong from Ram Kumar's house. He might have fired 3 or 4 shots of
.12-bore gun. Vinayanand might CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 267 have also fired 3 or 4
shots. The target used to be sometime a sparrow sitting on a tree. He might
have fired 25/30 shots from an air gun in which pellets are used. For targets,
sometimes points to be fixed in the wall and sometimes birds would be the made
targets. He could not see how far the fragments of bomb fell after explosion.
He volunteered to state that they had taken shelter behind a wall in order to
save themselves. After that, they saw that the fragment had spread within the
radius of 10 yards. He stated in his statement under Section 164 of the Cr. PC
that when bomb was exploded, there were present Ram Aasrey, Sudevanand &
Arteshanand. (When confronted with his previous statement under Section 164 of
the Cr. PC, it was found mentioned that these persons were told about the
method of exploding a country made bomb and that when Vinayanand threw the
bomb, it was exploded). He had not stated in his previous statement under
Section 164 of Cr. PC that they were taken to the banks of Ganga and Ram Kumar
explained how to take a aim with the revolver or that the tree being made a
target or a shot was fired by him for demonstration. He also did not remember
having stated that Ram Kumar then gave the revolver to Sudevanand and then
Sudevanand fired a shot. He was confronted with his previous statement
Ex.PW-1/X wherein it was not found recorded. He explained that he had not
stated in detailed under Section 164 of Cr. PC that he was given revolver to
fire, he was able to hit the target but Ram Kumar, and Sudevanand had missed
the aim. He had not stated in the statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC that
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 268 then they came back to Ram Kumar's house and found
Santoshanand and Shankaranand present there. He explained that he had not
stated in this sequence that thereafter at that very time, Tyageshwaranand @
Budheshawaranand also reached there at Ram Kumar's house. He further testified
that he stayed at Ram Kumar's house for 15/20 days during training but they
were visiting other places also during this time. It is elicited that PW-1 had
not stated in previous statement that he has fired a shot in the farm of Mr.
Biswas from country made revolver, which Mr. Biswas has supplied.
186\. The learned Defence Counsel pointed out certain trivial and explanatory
improvements in the statement of PW-1 on some points mentioned in the Para
above. He pointed out that PW-1 has not stated in his previous statement that
Arteshanand and Sudevanand did not receive the training as they had already
received such training; that he was introduced to Ram Kumar at Trimohan by his
name as Vijay and that Vinayanand was introduced as Jagdish; that when bomb
was exploded Ram Aasrey, Sudevanand and Arteshanand were present; Ram Kumar
gave revolver to Sudevanand who fired the shot; and that he was given revolver
to fire and he was able to hit the target but Ram Kumar and Sudevanand had
missed the aim. The line of cross- examination does not suggest that the above
persons namely PW-1 and Vinayanand did not go to the place of training namely
Trimohan where Ram Kumar imparted training to them in testing the firearms. It
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 269 is also not disputed that in the cross-examination
that Arteshanand and Sudevanand were present there. The cross-examination
rather fortifies the presence of all the above persons including A-1, A-2,
Vinayanand (PO), Ram Kumar (PO) and Arteshanand (since deceased) at the time
of training in arms and ammunitions by Ram Kumar at Trimohan. Mere omission or
the improvement does not go to discredit the testimony of this witness,
insofar as, the defence being unable to demolish the fact of their presence at
Trimohan and the training in arms.
21) Criminal Conspiracy at Trimohan
187\. It has come in the deposition of PW-1 that when he came to Trimohan and
reported to accused Santoshanand (A-1), he found that A-1 had brought a tape
recorded speech titled as "Parvachan" (sermons), which was delivered by Anand
Murti at Nagpur Dharam Maha Chakra (a religious congregation) and it was
attended by A-1 also. He deposed that in the month of August/September or
October 1971 (Upon court questions, the incident is related by the witness
having occurred during October 1973) on one night at the terrace of house of
Ram Kumar at Trimohan, he himself, Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand and Ram
Kumar assembled. Tape recorded speech "Parvachan" of Baba Anand Murti was
played by A-1 and then collective meditation was performed. (This was stated
by PW-1 in the court on 13.02.1981 at Page Number 19 in his examination in
chief. While replying the court question at Page Number 122, PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 270 1 clarified the month of the event to be October
1973, when meeting took place at the terrace of house of Ram Kumar (Proclaimed
Offender) at Trimohan. He further clarified that it appeared to be a
typographical error at Page No. 19. He further clarified that it was Dharam
Maha Chakra that had taken place in October/November 1971\. The recorded
speech, which was played on that day on Tape Recorder, pertained to this
Dharam Maha Chakra delivered by Anand Murti). When meditation was over, A-1
said that there were many enemies of Anand Marg, who are to be finished
because all peaceful methods having failed, they had to adopt violent means.
A-1 described Madhavanand Avadhoot as enemy no. 1 as he had become approver in
the murder case against Anand Murti and deserted Anand Marg and he should be
liquidated first. He described L.N. Mishra, the then Railway Minister as enemy
no. 2 and Abdul Gaffoor, Chief Minister of Bihar as enemy no. 3 being puppet
of L.N. Mishra who had ordered lathi charge on Anand Margies. Santoshanand
also described the Jail Doctor and Civil Surgeon of Patna as enemies apart
from Mr. Puri and Hingorani of CBI. On the same night, Santoshanand assigned
the duty to Vinayanand to kill Madhavanand and he (PW-1) was given the duty of
killing Chief Minister Abdul Gaffoor. Sudevanand was assigned duty to kill
officers of CBI and Arteshanand was assigned the duty to kill the Jail Doctor
and Civil Surgeon of Patna but no duty was assigned to Ram Kumar and regarding
L.N. Mishra, it was resolved that it would be decided later on as to who would
be asked to kill him.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 271
188\. It is elicited in the cross-examination of PW-1 that the tape recorder
was not played frequently but only it was done on that night. He testified
that in the tape-recorded message, it was not the message of Anand Murti that
all the peaceful methods have failed and violent methods have to be adopted.
He admitted the suggestion of the defence that it is Santoshanand, who
explained of his own that he had a feeling that they should kill all the
enemies by violent means. He deposed that after playing the tape recorder,
Santoshanand had said that he had some inward feeling that all the enemies of
Anand Marg should be finished. In his further cross-examination, PW-1 replied
that in his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC, he has not given the reason
for killing Abdul Gaffoor as he ordered of lathi charge on Anand Margies or
for killing L.N. Mishra as Abdul Gaffoor was the puppet of L.N. Mishra. He
might have stated in his statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC that Ram Kumar
had said that if Madhavanand Approver was killed, the entire government
machinery would be paralysed. When confronted with his statement Ex.PW-1/X, it
was not found recorded. (PW-1 has not attributed these words in his
examination in chief nor in his 164 statement. This aspect of cross-
examination is only a bulwark on the part of the defence to confound and
confuse the witness and to mislead the court. The cross- examination thus
becomes un-understandable and is of no help to arrive at the maneuvers to
disbelieve the conceptualization of the conspiracy and the acts that followed
thereafter.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 272
189\. The defence had tried to put the words in the mouth of witness only to
mislead the witness. He has not stated in his previous statement under Section
164 of the Cr. PC that Santoshanand refuted it and said that Madhavanand
should be liquidated as enemy no.1. He might have stated that they all
including Ram Kumar agreed to it and to kill all other enemies. He had not
stated in the statement under Section 164 of the Cr. PC that it was decided to
defer the duty of killing of L.N. Mishra to someone else in future. He had
also not stated specifically that Ram Kumar was not given any duty at that
time.
190\. There is no cross-examination by the defence as regards the meeting held
at the terrace of house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan in the month of October 1973.
They have also not challenged the veracity and testimony of PW-1 that after
playing tape recorded speech of Anand Murti, Santoshanand exhorted them (Ram
Kumar, PW-1, Vinayanand, Arteshanand and Sudevanand) that Madhavanand, Abdul
Gaffoor, L.N. Mishra, Jail Doctors, Civil Surgeon, Hingorani and Puri of CBI
are to be killed. Thus, the testimony of this witness on these vital points
remains unrebutted and makes it creditworthy. It is also not challenged in
cross-examination of PW-1 that after meditation, Santoshanand having said that
there were many enemies of Anand Marg, who were to be eliminated since all
peaceful methods yielded no results and they had to resort to violent means
against the persons CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 273 whose names mentioned above. The
defence has also not specifically given any suggestion to PW-1 regarding
Santoshanand describing Madhavanand Avadhoot to be enemy no.1, since the said
Madhavanand deserted the cult to become Approver in the case against Anand
Murti. The defence has also not given any suggestion to PW-1 concerning
Santoshanand describing L.N. Mishra as enemy no.2 and Abdul Gaffoor, Chief
Minister of Bihar as enemy no.3. It is a well-settled principle of law that
when the other party in his cross- examination does not dispute an assertion
in the examination in chief of a witness, the version of witnesses is to be
believed. In this regard, reliance can be placed on a very recent Division
Bench Judgment of our own Hon'ble High Court in Rakesh Kumar & Ors. Vs. State
(Delhi), 2009 (163) DLT 658, and Para No. 175 of the judgment reads as under:
-
> 175\. It is settled law that where a witness is not cross-examined on any
> relevant aspect, the correctness of the statement made by a witness cannot
> be disputed. (See the decisions of Supreme Court reported as State of U.P.
> v. Nahar Singh, AIR 1988 Supreme Court 1328 and Rajinder Prasad v. Darshana
> Devi, V (2001) SLT 780 = AIR 2001 Supreme Court 3207).
191\. Further, the Hon'ble MP High Court has held in Moti Lal and Others Vs.
State of Madhya Pradesh, 1990, Crl. L.J (NOC ) 125 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 274 that
it is a well settled principle of law that when the accused does not challenge
a prosecution witness in his cross-examination on certain facts, it leads to
inference of admission of that fact. Similarly, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
has held in Srawan Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2002 ( 4) RCR ( Crl) 471 that it
is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to
avail himself the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must
follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.
Reference can also be given to a latest judgment of the Apex court in Paulmeli
Vs. State of Tamilnadu through Inspector of Police, 2014 (4) RCR
335\.
192\. In order to belie the case of the prosecution that a criminal conspiracy
to kill Sh. Madhavanand, Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, Sh. L.N. Mishra and others was
hatched at the terrace of the house of Sh. Ram Kumar Singh (Proclaimed
Offender) at Trimohan, the defence has examined DW-15 Sh. Harender Kumar
Singh, a cousin of Sh. Ram Kumar Singh. In his examination-in-chief, he has
testified that he is an Anand Margi since 1957. He had taken diksha at that
time. Their entire family is of Anand Margies. He deposed that accused Ram
Kumar Singh is his nephew and he has been residing in an adjacent house. He
testified that police arrested Ram Kumar Singh in 1974 and he was released on
bail after two and half month of his arrest. Anand Margies used to visit him
and then he would take them to Ram Kumar Singh, if so desired by the visitor.
To his knowledge, no meeting of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 275 Anand Margies took place
on the terrace of the house of Ram Kumar Singh. In his examination-in-chief
earlier, he testified that Ram Kumar Singh might be handling firearms, as his
father used to handle the same. He deposed that he had not seen him doing so.
In his cross- examination, it is revealed that he had joint farming with Ram
Kumar Singh and they used to divide the share of produce. Ram Kumar Singh was
his nephew. In his further elicited from his cross-examination that DW-15 has
confined his activities only to Kahalgaon Block, which is situated at a
distance of about 4 or 5 KMs from Trimohan. Both of them used to attend Dharam
Maha Chakra, which used to be held for three days; there was a Railway Station
in Trimohan in the year 1972-1974, which was known as Ekchari. In his further
cross- examination, he could not dare to deny whether any decision was taken
by Anand Margies to put pressure on the Government to release Anand Murti.
193\. This witness DW-15 is one of the oldest members of Anand Marg, who has
taken Diksha. When he had confined himself and his activities to Village/Block
Kahalgaon, which is situated at a distance of 4 or 5 KMs from Trimohan, one
wonders as to how could he say that no meeting of the conspirators had taken
place at the terrace of the house of Ram Kumar Singh. DW-15 and Ram Kumar
Singh had their joint agriculture. Both of them used to attend Dharam Maha
Chakra. Like DW-1 and DW-3 he is also an interested, biased and partisan
witness and no reliance can be placed on his testimony.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 276
194\. The defence evidence in fact pointed that this witness being an Anand
Margi, knew very well that Ram Kumar, a fellow Anand Margi, was visited by
several fellow Anand Margies. It also points to the expertise of Ram Kumar in
handling arms and ammunitions and admits that Ram Kumar was once arrested. The
deposition of this witness does not go to demolish the deposition of PW-1
about the meeting that took place on the terrace of the house of Ram Kumar.
22) Visit of PW-1 to meet Din Pal Rai
195\. After his attempt to obtain arms and ammunitions from PW-34 Sh. Jagat
Ram Dogra having failed, PW-1 returned from Indore and came to Trimohan. There
he met Shankaranand, explained the futile visit to PW-34 at Indore. After 2-3
days, Shankaranand brought a letter from Aacharya Rudranand addressed to Din
Pal Rai, Advocate and Anand Margi of Azamgarh. PW-1 knew Din Pal Rai even
earlier since he used to participate in VSS Camps. PW-1 came to Azamgarh with
the letter and met Din Pal Rai. He informed Din Pal Rai that Rudranand and A-1
were busy in collecting arms. However, Din Pal Rai did not give him the
revolver. PW-1 returned to Trimohan and reported the same to A-1. Thereafter,
as mentioned above, conspiracy was hatched in October 1973 at the terrace of
the house at Trimohan to kill Sh. Madhavanand Avadhoot, Sh. L.N. Mishra and
Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, Jail Doctors, two Officers of CBI Sh. Puri and Sh.
Hingorani.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 277
196\. PW-1 further testified that on the same night, after the conspiracy at
the terrace of the house at Trimohan was hatched, he was again directed by A-1
to go to Azamgarh to bring revolver from Din Pal Rai.
197\. PW-1 further deposed that Santoshanand also directed Arteshanand,
Vinayanand and Sudevanand to arrange a house at Patna as killing was to be
carried out at Patna.
198\. In the morning, he (PW-1) left for Azamgarh, met Din Pal Rai and
narrated him entire discussion that had taken place on that night at the house
of Ram Kumar in village Trimohan. Then Din Pal Rai showed him a Webley make
revolver of 32 bore English make and explained him how it works and there were
6 live cartridges in that revolver. Sh. Din Pal Rai took him to a nearby
Hillock and he (PW-1) fired one shot and realised that the revolver was in
working condition and the cartridges were live. Din Pal Rai loaded another
live cartridge for spent up one and thus it was loaded with six live
cartridges. He came back to Trimohan with the revolver and cartridges via
Kahalgaon and reached the house of Ram Kumar where Arteshanand, Sudevanand and
Vinayanand were already present. He showed them the revolver and Ram Kumar
also came and saw that revolver. Ram Kumar tested its working and remarked
that such a revolver was difficult to procure in the market. Ram Kumar was
already in possession of 3 cartridges of the same bore for use in the revolver
and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 278 then they were all taken to nearby banks of Ganga.
Ram Kumar explained them how the aim was to be taken with the revolver, he
gave the demonstration by making a tree as target, and he himself fired the
shot. Then he (Ram Kumar) gave the revolver to Sudevanand to aim a shot.
Sudevanand fired a shot. Thereafter, he (PW-1) was given the revolver to hit
the target i.e. the tree. He was able to hit the target, whereas Ram Kumar and
A-2 missed the target. Then they came back to his house where A-1 and
Shankaranand were present and revolver was shown to them and they approved it.
He deposed that at that time Avadhoot Tyageshwaranand @ Budheshawaranand clad
in saffron clothes also reached there. He was VSS organizer of Bihar Province.
He knew him from before. Probably he is dead now. Budheshawaranand also
approved the revolver but he suggested that the house of Ram Kumar was not an
appropriate place for this purpose and house of Gopalji at Chautham, Distt.
Monghyer would be more appropriate for such like activities. He also testified
that Gopalji had come to Bhagalpur.
199\. PW-98 Sh. Mohinder Nath Singh of Village Bara, District Azamgarh (UP)
stated that on 16.2.1973 at about 6.00 PM he was going out to answer the call
of the nature when Sh. Deen Pal Rai came there. He was known to him. He asked
Sh. Deen Pal Rai to wait in the room and he will return soon. When he came
back after 15/20 minutes, he found Sh. Deen Pal Rai in the room. He had kept
his Weblascot Revolver under his pillow during night and there were four CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 279 cartridges in the revolver, which was loaded one.
After his return, Sh. Deen Pal Rai took out the loaded revolver and four
cartridges from under the pillow and took them away with him. He lodged a
report with Police Station Kotwali Mark PW-98/A, Crime No. 160 dated
16.02.1973. He stated the number of his revolver as A-23485. In his cross-
examination PW-98 replied that he had seen Din Pal Rai going out of the room
swiftly. He inquired from him as to why he was taking his revolver and
cartridges, but gave no reply. He raised the alarm, but no one came there. He
did not chase Din Pal Rai, as he was having a loaded revolver. However, some
school teachers came there and one or two other persons came there. He did not
give the number of his revolver to the police. He purchased the revolver from
Kanpur, but could not remember the name of the shop from where it was
purchased. He admitted the suggestion that Sh. Din Pal Rai was acquitted. He
was acquitted after his statement was recorded by the CBI Officer.
200\. PW-90 Sh. Dalip Rai, SI, PS Kotwali Azamgarh, deposed that the record of
crime case no. 160 dated 16.2.1973 under section 380 IPC PS Kotwali has been
destroyed four years ago. In his cross- examination, he replied that Deen Pal
Rai, Advocate was accused in the case. He was acquitted on 25.8.1976 by the
court of CJM, Azamgarh as per Crime Register No.4 brought by him. He stated
that he did not try to obtain certified copy of judgment as judicial file was
stated to be destroyed.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 280
201\. The accused persons have examined Sh. Deen Pal Rai as DW-
24\. The testimony of this defence witness goes to show that he is initiated
into Anand Marg and took Diksha in the year 1968. He is a farmer and an
Advocate. He does not know any person by the name of Visheshwaranand and none
came to him for arms at Azamgarh between the years 1971-1975. Azamgarh area
does not have any hillock. According to him, during emergency period in the
year 1975, police came to his residence in his absence. This information was
passed to him by his son and he fled to Banaras where his father arrived at
the behest of his father, he surrendered to police and was arrested at Raksol.
He remained in different jails. He was sent to CBI remand for 15 days. During
his stay in jail, he came in contact with many Anand Margies i.e.
Santoshanand, Ranjan Dwivedi, Shankaranand etc. He further deposed that CBI
lured and pressurized him to be their witness in this case. In his cross-
examination, DW-24 admitted that cult head was arrested in murder of one of
the defectors, which ended in acquittal, which he volunteered to say. He was
not aware of rejection of bail of his cult head. He is also not aware of any
Revolutionary Group. He has denied the suggestion put by Prosecution regarding
his proximity with Rudranand, Rudranand writing a letter to him and sending
through Visheshwaranand and Rudranand desiring a revolver to be procured from
him through Visheshwaranand. He also denied that Visheshwaranand met him and
talked about the revolver or that he has shown a revolver to CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 281 Visheshwaranand during August/September 1973 or has given
demonstration of its working near a hillock. He further denied having given a
revolver to Visheshwaranand to be further given to Rudranand or Santoshanand.
202\. After going through the deposition of DW-24 Sh. Deen Pal Rai, the
question arises as to how much value can be attached to his testimony.
Admittedly, he is also an Anand Margi and took Diksha in 1968 from Aacharya
Nirmohanand. He admits having met accused persons and Anand Margies in the
jail while this case was under investigations since he claimed that CBI either
lured him or pressurized him to become their witness against the accused
persons. He has suppressed the fact by denying the suggestion of the
Prosecution that he knew Rudranand, an Anand Margi very closely. In fact,
Rudranand Avadhoot has also been examined by the defence as DW-1 who has
admitted/testified his examination-in-chief itself that he knew Sh. Deen Pal
Rai of Azamgarh. With this background, his denials about securing a firearm
are to be looked into. Though he denied considering the background of his
avowed affiliation and attachment to the cult, his evidence is to be discarded
as a piece of canard. It must also be noted that this witness who was arrested
during emergency and further having been taken to custodial interrogation by
the CBI had avenged his arrest by speaking in favour of the accused persons.
His testimony is falling short of inspiring any confidence in the mind of the
Court in the backdrop of proved, profuse CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 282 and inspiring
evidence of PW-1 Sh. Visheshwaranand corroborated by other circumstances,
which I have discussed supra.
23) Effect of acquittal of Din Pal Rai
203\. The Ld. Defence Counsel argued that case of the prosecution is falsified
by statement of PW-90 Sh. Dalip Rai that Deen Pal Rai (DW-
24), who is alleged to have given revolver with cartridges to PW-1, has been
acquitted by the court of CJM, Azamgarh. Copy of judgment has not been
produced and DW-24 Deen Pal Rai has not stated even a single word in his
statement that he was acquitted. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that
DW-24 Din Pal Rai had been acquitted of the charge u/s 380 IPC for committing
theft of the revolver of PW-98 Sh. Mohinder Nath Singh which was allegedly
given by Sh. Din Pal Rai to PW-1 and prosecution is not able to prove this
part of its case against accused persons. The question is whether the said
acquittal touches centroid of conspiracy or whether it is only peripheral.
Even if so called acquittal is taken in its face value, whether the same would
shatter the chain of conspiracy. It is in evidence of PW-1 that conspiracy was
hatched at the roof of house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan to kill Madhavanand,
L.N. Mishra, Abdul Gaffoor and others which is by itself an offence. To
execute the criminal conspiracy, arms and ammunitions were collected. Sh. Deen
Pal Rai (PW-24) was one of the sources from whom arms and ammunitions were
collected as per the case of the prosecution. Statement of PW-1 that he went
twice to Indore to collect arms and ammunitions from CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 283 PW-34
Jagat Ram Dogra has already been corroborated by PW-34 Sh. Jagat Ram Dogra,
PW-19 Sh. Purshottam Kumar, PW-83 Sh. M.P. Sharma and PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar
Parsad as discussed hereinbefore. PW-1 had also found in the house of Prem
Kumar at Patna where Aacharya Ram Aasrey had been residing, and there a clean-
shaved Bengali gentle man was sitting and on a wooden rack, a jhola containing
five country made bombs was kept. Ram Aasrey was living in that house who
introduced PW-1 and Vinayanand to Prem Kumar as 'Vijay' and 'Jagdish'. On
asking of Ram Aasrey, he along with Vinayanand and Ram Aasrey came to Arrah
and Ram Aasrey arranged their stay in Anand Marg Primary School in Arrah and
jhola containing bombs was with PW-1. PW-1 later on handed over that jhola
containing bombs to Ram Kumar at village Trimohan in the presence of
Vinayanand, Shankaranand, Sudevanand and Arteshanand. There at Trimohan, Ram
Kumar trained PW-1 and Vinayanand in Judo, use of 12 bore guns, extent of
energy of country- made bomb and how to throw and handle it. Subsequently,
Santoshanand sent PW-1 to Sh. Saroj Kumar Biswas of Bangaon who asked PW-1 to
wait for some days, as he will try to procure arms and ammunitions. PW-1
stayed there for 2/3 days and then Sh. Saroj Kumar Biswas gave him a country-
made revolver 303 with three live cartridges and 110 cartridges which were of
the type of 303. PW-1 gave all these to Gopalji, accused at Chautham. There
Santoshanand came after 1/2 days and PW-1 told him that hand grenades could
not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 284 be procured by Mr. Biswas and then Santoshanand and
Vinayanand went to Bangaon for the purpose.
204\. Therefore, the conceived intentions have been proved to achieve the end
designs and it is natural human conduct that such person would leave no stone
unturned to reach the design. Therefore, procuring of this weapon i.e. stolen
revolver from Din Pal Rai, which entailed his prosecution resulting into his
acquittal as stated by PW- 90, remains only peripheral and does not go to
shatter the centroid of conspiracy, which is the subject matter in this charge
sheet.
24) PW-1's delivering arms to Gopalji brought from S.K. Biswas - visit of A-1
& Vinayanand to Bangaon to bring hand grenades - telegram of A-1 to Gopalji.
205\. PW-1 further testified that from Bhagalpur, he along with Ram Kumar came
to Trimohan. He brought with him a letter given by Santoshanand. Rest of the
party went to Patna side by train. On the same night from Trimohan, he took a
train for Howrah and reached Bangaon. He gave the letter to Saroj Kumar Biswas
at Bangaon. He (Saroj Kumar Biswas) asked him to wait for some days and during
which period he would try to procure arms and ammunitions. He stayed there
with Saroj Kumar Biswas for 2-3 days. Sh. Biswas gave him a country made
revolver 303 with three live cartridges. He (Mr. Biswas) also gave him 110
cartridges, which were of the type of 303. In order to test its working, he
fired a shot in nearby farm of Mr. CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 285 Biswas. Mr.
Biswas told him that he could not arrange hand grenade but was trying for it.
So, he (PW-1) brought that revolver with two live cartridges and other 110
cartridges to Chautham and gave all these to Gopalji. He deposed that after
2-3 days, Vinayanand (PO), Arteshanand (Since died) and Sudevanand (A-2) also
reached at the house of Gopalji (A-7). There he saw that Vinayanand had
brought a revolver from Ram Kumar, which he (PW-1) had given him on being
brought from Din Pal Rai, Advocate of Azamgarh. Vinayanand gave that revolver
to A-7. At that time, he, Vinayanand, Arteshanand, A-2 and A-7 were present.
He further testified that after 1-2 days, Santoshanand (A-1) also reached
there and he told A-1 about articles he had brought from Bangaon. He also
informed A-1 that Mr. Biswas could not procure hand grenades but was trying
for it. A-1 asked him that he (PW-1) should go again to Bangaon to procure
hand grenades from Mr. Biswas. He (PW-1) informed A-1 that he could understand
Bengali language only a little but cannot speak it. He (PW-1) suggested to A-1
that as Vinayanand could understand and speak Bengali language, he should be
sent to Bangaon for this purpose and A-1 agreed to it. A-1 told him that he
along with Vinayanand would be going to Bangaon and if his return is delayed,
he would send a telegram in the name of 'Prabhu' and would come back by 2nd or
3rd December 1973. He testified that he himself, Arteshanand, A-2 and A-7
stayed back at Chautham. A-1 and Vinayanand did not come back on 2nd or 3rd
December 1973 and a telegram was received on 2 or 3rd CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 286
December 1973 from A-1. It was addressed to A-7 in which he described himself
as "Prabhu". By this telegram, A-1 instructed them that they should continue
to stay on at Chautham.
(This telegram Ex.PW-1/O (D-67) is available in Folder R-4).
206\. A perusal of this telegram shows that it was dispatched from Howrah and
addressed to Gopalji, Chautham and the message is "All to wait, Prabu". This
telegram was received by Gopalji in due course of business at Chautham,
Monghyer on 3.12.1973 as per postal stamp- cum-seal. This was recovered from
house search of Gopalji on 17.5.1975 when a search was carried out by PW-134
Sh. M.M.P. Sinha, I.O., in the presence of two search witnesses namely Sh.
Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Neel Mohan Singh. At the time of search, both the
recovery witnesses and the IO put their respective signatures. Search Memo is
Ex.PW-91/A.
207\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 replied that he did not state in the
statement under Section 164 of the Cr. PC that when he gave letter of
Santoshanand to a Bengali gentleman at Bangaon, he told him "that he would try
to procure arms and ammunitions and he should wait for two or three days". He
had also not stated that he told Santoshanand at Chautham that Mr. Biswas had
not been able to procure hand grenade but was trying for it. He had also not
stated that Santoshanand asked him to go again to Bangaon to procure hand
grenade from Mr. Biswas. He had also not stated that he told Santoshanand that
he was not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 287 conversant with Bengali language or that
Vinayanand who could speak and understand this language should be sent and he
agreed to it. He had also not stated before the Magistrate that Santoshanand
said that he himself would go with Vinayanand to Bangaon and if his return was
late, he would send a telegram by the name of 'Prabhu'. He had also not stated
in such detail that Santoshanand told him that he would come back by 2nd or
3rd December, 1973. He had also not stated that he, Arteshanand, Sudevanand
and Gopalji stayed back at Chautham or that Santoshanand and Vinayanand did
not return by 2nd or 3rd December 1973. He had also not stated that this
telegram was received from Santoshanand in which he described himself as
'Prabhu'. He had also not stated in the statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC
that Santoshanand had written in this telegram that they should continue to
stay at Chautham.
208\. The line of the cross-examination of PW-1 on the above points indicate
that the defence remained unsuccessful in belying that Budheshawaranand @
Tyageshwaranand suggested that the house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan was not
appropriate place for this purpose and house of Gopalji at Chautham at
District Monghyer would be appropriate place for such like activities. The
cross-examination of PW-1 also does not discredit the deposition of PW-1 that
PW-1, Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Tyageshwaranand and
Ram Kumar went to Bhagalpur, near Janta Library, where house of Gopalji was
situated and Gopalji had come CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 288 there. They went to his
house and met him. The defence also did not demolish the testimony to the
effect that Gopalji had a house at Bhagalpur near Janta Library. The accused
persons have also not shaken the version of PW-1 in his cross-examination that
at Bhagalpur, accused Santoshanand gave PW-1 a letter and directed PW-1 to go
to Sh. Saroj Kumar Biswas at Bangaon and bring arms and ammunitions from him.
They have also not disputed that Santoshanand asked Gopalji in his presence
for collection of arms and ammunitions at his house at Chautham. The cross-
examination is silent to the assertion of PW-1 that Santoshanand informed
Gopalji about formation of a Revolutionary Group for the release of Anand
Murti and certain persons are to be eliminated & for this purpose arms and
ammunitions are to be collected, which shall be kept at his house at Chautham.
The Ld. Defence Counsel have pointed out certain improvements of PW-1 qua his
previous statement; that Biswas had asked him to wait 2/3 days and that
Santoshanand asked him to go again to Bangaon. Further, they pointed out the
improvement concerning PW-1 that he was not knowing Bengali language and
Santoshanand should send Vinayanand for the purpose. They further brought the
notice of the court to the improvement that Santoshanand told that in case he
does not reach by 2nd or 3 rd December, he would be sending a telegram in the
name of Prabhu. The improvements pointed out by the Ld. Defence Counsel on the
face of it are trivial and explanatory in nature. PW-1 has narrated the
complete facts of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 289 case in his knowledge in the
court and he has given minor details from beginning until end, which does not
at all suggest that he has been tutored to make a statement. Therefore, the
case of the prosecution is not affected from those alleged improvements. These
improvements do not prejudice the defence for the reason that they were unable
to demolish certain aspects of the usage of the house of Gopalji at Chautham
and also at Bhagalpur, the congregation of the named persons, who conceived
the idea to form a Revolutionary Group. The aspects of formation of the Group,
the deliberations that had taken place and the successive acts of those
persons to achieve their designs were never seriously disputed in the cross-
examination by the defence. This court is of the opinion that the improvements
are merely decorative aspect of the facts spoken to, which remained
unrebutted. The deposition of PW-1 that Santoshanand informed Gopalji about
decision of formation of a Revolutionary Group, the need for elimination of
certain persons to press the release of Baba Anand Murti, for which purposes
arms and ammunitions were to be procured, all have been accepted by accused
Gopalji. Gopalji further volunteered that henceforth the meetings would take
place either at his house at Chautham or at his farmhouse at Tilihar. He has
also accepted the consignment of one revolver 303, two live cartridges of this
revolver and similar 110 cartridges from PW-1 at Chautham. He also accepted
one revolver brought by Vinayanand from Ram Kumar at Chautham in the presence
of PW-1. Therefore, the accused Gopalji CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 290 at that point of
time has actively participated acceded to the designs of such of the
conspirators as described by PW-1. He further allowed himself to be a part of
such conspiracy, conceded and volunteered to make use of his house for piling
of arms. Hence, considering the testimony, which is not shaken, the role of
Gopalji in the conspiracy and the acts succeeding thereon is proved on rec ord
by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.
209\. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati that the manuscript
of telegram has not been seized by the IO and the record of dispatch and
delivery of the telegram has not been produced to prove that the manuscript of
the telegram was in the handwriting of Santoshanand by describing himself as
Prabhu or that it was delivered to Gopalji. She argued that when accused
Santoshanand had gone to Bangaon, how it could be dispatched from Howrah when
according to Ld. Defence Counsel is at a distance of 100 KM from Bangaon. I do
not find any merit in these arguments. U/s 88 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the
court may presume that a message, forwarded from a telegraph office to the
person to whom such message purports to be addressed, corresponds with a
message delivered for transmission at the office from which the message
purports to be sent. A perusal of this telegram Ex.PW-1/O shows that it was
dispatched from Howrah and addressed to Gopalji, Chautham and the message is
"All to wait, Prabu". This also bears the postal stamp-cum-seal dated
03.12.1973. This telegram was recovered from the house search of Gopalji by
the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 291 IO PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha in the presence of search
witnesses including Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) on 17.05.1975 vide Seizure
Memo Ex.PW-91/A. This telegram rather corroborates the deposition of the
approver PW-1 that Santoshanand informed them that he along with Vinayanand
would go to Bangaon for collections of arms and ammunitions and hand grenade
from Saroj Kumar Biswas and if they get late, he will send a telegram under
the name of Prabhu. The name of the sender mentioned in the telegram is Prabhu
and this is addressed to Gopalji. Accused Santoshanand had asked the addressee
to continue to stay. The recovery of the telegram further indicates that it
was received by Gopalji in due course of business at Chautham, Monghyer on
3.12.1973. Therefore, there was no occasion for seizure of the manuscript of
the telegram. There was no requirement of producing the dispatch register and
delivery receipt, when the original telegram bearing the postal stamp/seal was
recovered, seized from the house of Gopalji, during the search. How accused
Santoshanand came to Howrah from Bangaon is within knowledge of accused
Santoshanand u/s 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, he has not
explained it in his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC. Moreover, it is not
denied during the course of arguments that Howrah falls between Bangaon and
Chautham. The statement of PW-1 is further corroborated by telegram Ex.PW-1/O
regarding going of Santoshanand along with Vinayanand to Bangaon for
collection of hand grenades from Mr. Saroj Kumar Biswas. This further CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 292 corroborates the testimony of PW-1 about his complicity and that
of Santoshanand and Gopalji in the criminal conspiracy.
210\. PW-1 further testified that it was discussed by him, Gopalji,
Arteshanand and Sudevanand that 110 cartridges brought by him from Mr. Saroj
Kumar Biswas of Bangaon would be useless unless a suitable weapon for these
cartridges was got manufactured. He further deposed that Arteshanand then
stated that he would procure a weapon for these cartridges from one Manohar
Darve, an ITI Instructor at Jabalpur, who was a staunch worker of VSS. As
such, Arteshanand and Sudevanand left Chautham on this mission. Santoshanand
came there 1-2 days after receipt of the telegram at Gopalji's house. He
deposed that Santoshanand told him that Vinayanand would stay at Bangaon for
the mission for which they had gone there. He further deposed that before
return of Vinayanand, Sudevanand and Arteshanand to Chautham, he along with
Santoshanand went to Patna in or about 2nd week of December 1973. They both
went to house, which had been taken on rent at Gulzar Bagh. There Arteshanand
and Sudevanand met them who were already present. Arteshanand told that he
could not be successful in getting the arms manufactured by Manohar Darve for
which purpose he was brought to Patna. Darve was not there at Patna when they
reached there and had gone back.
211\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 replied that he has not mentioned in the
statement under Section 164 of the Cr. PC that in the CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 293
absence of Santoshanand and Vinayanand, it was discussed at Chautham that 110
cartridges brought from Bangaon would be useless unless a weapon for the same
was got manufactured. He did not state that the job of manufacturing arms for
use of 110 cartridges was entrusted to Arteshanand. He has not stated before
the Magistrate that this was discussed amongst Gopalji, Arteshanand,
Sudevanand and he himself. He voluntarily explained that he had not made a
detailed statement.
212\. The Ld. Defence Counsel has pointed out certain improvements in the
statement of PW-1 during the course of his cross-examination, to the effect
that 110 cartridges would be useless unless a proper weapon is got made or
that duty to procure the arms was assigned to Arteshanand. The course of
cross-examination by the accused persons does not discredit the visit of PW-1
with Santoshanand in the house at Gulzar Bagh, where they met Arteshanand and
Sudevanand. PW-1 has not stated in his examination in chief that duty to
procure arms was assigned to Arteshanand and therefore the question of stating
before the Magistrate in the previous statement does not arise. Moreover, as
per the deposition of PW-1, it is Arteshanand himself who assured the co-
conspirators that he would procure arms for those 110 cartridges. In fact,
these are the matter of minor details, which all were not required to be
mentioned in the previous statement.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 294
213\. The prosecution has examined PW-105 Sh. Dass Narayan Sharma and PW-44
Sh. S.S. Vartak to prove that pursuant to the criminal conspiracy, accused
Arteshanand and Sudevanand tried to get a weapon manufactured from Manohar
Darve, so that said 110 cartridges are used. PW-44 Sh. S.S. Vartak, Principal,
ITI, Chhindwara, brought the leave application dated 16.12.1973 Ex.PW- 44/A of
Manohar Darve and deposed that R.L. Malhotra was Principal, ITI Chhindwara at
that time and he (PW-44) has succeeded him in the year 1974. He was able to
identify the handwriting and signature of Sh. R.L. Malhotra, as he had seen
him writing and signing since he took over the charge from him. He identified
signatures of Sh. Darve on application Ex.PW-44/A at point A and of Sh.
Malhotra on the order dated 28.12.1973 Ex.PW-44/B at point A. He testified
that Manohar Darve was Anand Margi. He was detained under MISA in the year
1975. (Ex.PW-44/DA is the order of the Director, Employment and Training,
Madhya Pradesh dated 15.07.1975, wherein it is mentioned that M.S. Darve, ITI,
Chhindwara had been arrested and detained by Collector and District
Magistrate, Chhindwara under MISA on 04.07.1975 and M.S. Darve is placed under
suspension).
214\. PW-44 admitted in his cross-examination that the application by M.S.
Darve was submitted on medical grounds. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that when
he was sick, he was not expected to come to Patna and PW-1 had deposed that it
was in or about 2nd week of December CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 295 1973, when PW-1
along with Santoshanand went to Patna, and visited house at Gulzar Bagh where
they met Arteshanand and Sudevanand and at that time Arteshanand told them
that he could not be successful in getting arms manufactured by Manohar Darve
for which purpose, Manohar Darve was brought there. It was argued that
application for leave was submitted on 16.12.1973 which was allowed for the
period from 17.12.1973 to 22.12.1973 and so in 2nd week, Sh. Manohar Darve
cannot be expected in Patna. However, there is no force in the argument of Ld.
Counsel as she urges this court to take a very technical approach of the
deposition of PW-1 that it was in or about 2nd week of December 1973, when
PW-1 along with Santoshanand went to Patna, and visited house at Gulzar Bagh.
PW-1 has stated that it was in or about 2nd week of December 1973 and has
deposed by approximation. The record reveals that Manohar Darve remained on
earned leave with effect from 17.12.1973 to 22.12.1973. Manohar Darve was
granted earned leave on his said application for the period from 17.12.1973 to
22.12.1973 vide order Ex.PW-44/B dated 26.12.1973.
215\. Leave Application Ex.PW-44/A and Order dated 28.12.1973 Ex.PW-44/B
passed by the Principal, ITI, Chhindwara sanctioning six earned leave from
17.12.1973 to 22.12.1973, are available in Folder R-7.

216\. Moreover, to avail medical leave only intimation is given and formal
application is submitted only after availing the medical leave with medical
certificate to take rest and fitness certificate. Medical leave is never
applied in advance. PW-1 has testified the relevant period to be 2nd week of
December 1973 by approximation. Therefore, it could be from 17.12.1973 to
22.12.1973, which is proved on record, when Manohar Darve remained on earned
leave. This application clearly corroborates the statement of approver PW-1
Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava that Manohar Darve was brought to Patna for
manufacturing arms/revolver in or about 2nd week of December 1973 and he has
been on earned leave from 17.12.1973 to 22.12.1973. Moreover, in the cross-
examination, the defence has not controverted his assertion that Manohar Darve
was an Anand Margi. Ld. Defence Counsel referred PW-105 Sh. Dass Narayan
Sharma, who testified that Sh. Radhey Mahto gave his property on rent @
Rs.20/- per month to Aacharya Vinayanand. The house of Radhey Mahto is
situated at some distance in Mohalla Tulsi Mandi, Gulzar Bagh. He deposed that
once Aacharya Vinayanand brought a person "Mohan" and on asking, he allowed
that person to stay in the night. The witness was declared hostile by the
court and cross-examined by Ld. Special P.P. The witness could not conceal the
truth in his further cross-examination by Ld. Special P.P. and it was
successfully elicited that he did not remember whether that Manohar stayed in
the karkhana (workshop) for 2/3 days or that he does not remember whether he
stated to CBI CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 297 officer that Manohar Darve stayed there
for 2/3 days. He testified that he does not want to say anything whether CBI
officer has recorded his statement to the effect that Manohar Darve stayed for
2/3 days. It is clear enough that PW-105 stated to CBI officer about staying
of Manohar Darve in his karkhana which was given on rent to Vinayanand.
217\. It has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh &
anr. Vs. State of Gujarat 11 (2006) SLT 527 that the object of the criminal
trial is to mete out justice and a trial should be search for truth and to
convict the guilt and protect the innocent and a trial should be a search for
the truth and not about over technicalities and the proof of charge which has
to be beyond reasonable doubt must depend upon judicial evaluation of the
totality of the evidence, oral and circumstantial and not by an isolated
scrutiny. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further held that time has become ripe to
act on account of numerous experiences faced by Courts on account of frequent
turning of witnesses as hostile, either due to threats, coercion, lures and
monetary considerations at the instance of those in power, their henchmen and
hirelings, political clouts and patronage and innumerable other corrupt
practices ingeniously adopted to smother and stifle the truth and realities
coming out to surface rendering truth and justice to become ultimate
casualties. Simply because a witness has been declared hostile and made
different statements at different times does not lead to CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 298
justification to reject his evidence and the Court should be slow to act on
the testimony of such witness and his evidence has to be read as a whole with
a view to find out whether any weight should be attached to the same or not.
218\. In view of the law of land declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (supra), this court is not to reject the testimony of
hostile witness and the function of the court is to find the truth. No doubt,
PW-105 has deposed in examination chief the name of visitor as Mohan instead
of Manohar but when cross- examined by Ld. Special P.P., PW-105 could not
conceal the truth. He could not deny if it was Manohar, who stayed there in
the factory for 2 or 3 days. He also could not deny that he informed CBI about
staying of Manohar Darve for 2/3 days, in his previous statement.
25) Shifting of arms to Gulzar Bagh, Patna
219\. It is found in the statement of PW-1 that before return of Vinayanand,
Sudevanand and Arteshanand at Chautham, he along with Santoshanand went to
Patna in or about 2nd week of December 1973 in a house which had been taken on
rent at Gulzar Bagh. Arteshanand and Sudevanand were already present there. He
further deposed that arms and ammunitions, which had been kept at Chautham at
Gopalji's house, had been brought at Patna and kept at the house at Gulzar
Bagh. He stated that he used to stay in the same house whenever he went to
Patna.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 299
220\. In his cross-examination, when PW-1 was confronted with his previous
statement Ex.PW-1/X, it was also not found recorded therein about his
deposition that the arms and ammunitions kept at Gopalji's house at Chautham
were brought in the house at Gulzar Bagh. He deposed that arms and ammunitions
from Gopalji's house at Chautham were not shifted to the house at Gulzar Bagh,
Patna in his presence and view but he voluntarily deposed that he had seen
those arms and ammunitions "with his own eyes" in the house at Gulzar Bagh,
Patna. When he was confronted with his previous statement the words "with own
eyes" were not found mentioned. He did not remember the number of the house at
Gulzar Bagh. He did not know the name of the owner of the house but
voluntarily stated that this house was got rented by Das Narain Sharma, an
Anand Margi. He had seen the arms and ammunitions kept in a jhola in the house
at Gulzar Bagh. It is elicited in his cross-examination that decision to keep
the arms and ammunition at Gopalji's house at Chautham was considered and
taken at Bhagalpur and finally it was decided after Gopalji met them at
Bhagalpur.
221\. In the cross-examination of PW-1, the accused persons failed to demolish
his testimony that arms were kept at the house at Chautham initially or that
the same were shifted in December, 1973 in the house at Gulzar Bagh, Patna.
When the basic fact of keeping the arms in house at Chautham or shifting
thereof to the house at Gulzar Bagh, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 300 Patna, is not
disputed, even if PW-1 has not stated in his previous statement about shifting
of arms from Chautham to Gulzar Bagh does not affect the case of the
prosecution. Even otherwise, this improvement claimed by the accused persons
made by PW-1 is not vital to impact the case.
222\. There is no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel that PW-1 has
not disclosed as to how the arms and ammunitions were shifted from the house
of Gopalji at Chautham in the house at Gulzar Bagh and who was the person
involved in shifting the arms and ammunitions and in which vehicle the same
were carried from Chautham to Patna, since the cross-examination of PW-1 did
not shatter the shifting of arms as deposed by the witness. It is to be kept
in mind that this witness has never claimed having seen the shifting but as he
stayed in this very house at Gulzar Bagh and having seen the storing of arms
and ammunitions, he was competent enough to say so.
26) PW-1 tracking the movements of Bihar CM
223\. In the criminal conspiracy that was hatched at Trimohan, PW-1 was
assigned duty by Santoshanand to kill Abdul Gaffoor. To execute the conspiracy
to kill Abdul Gaffoor, accused Santoshanand (A-1) directed PW-1 to watch
movements of Abdul Gaffoor. PW-1 further deposed that A-1 told him that it
would take time for Vinayanand to come back from Bangaon and in the meantime,
he (PW-1) should follow the movements of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, the then Chief
Minister CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 301 of Bihar. He told A-1 that he had not seen Abdul
Gaffoor and he should be shown to him. He asked A-1 to find out where Abdul
Gaffoor was living. Then A-1 brought a photograph of Abdul Gaffoor from the
office of newspaper either 'PRADEEP' or 'Vishwabandhu', where father of A-1
was working. PW-1 saw the photograph and it was kept in the house at Gulzar
Bagh. Then accompanied by Sudevanand and Arteshanand, PW-1 went to the place
near which Abdul Gaffoor was residing. On return, they informed A-1 that he
had acquainted himself of the surroundings of the residence of Gaffoor Saahib.
Then A-1 suggested that he should go to the place of Abdul Gaffoor in the
guise of a businessman, and survey the situation from the point of view
whether action was possible there. He was provided coat, pant and shoes to be
put on by him. He (PW-1) went to his house in the businessperson's guise, saw
Abdul Gaffoor there, and found that the place was well guarded. He told
Santoshanand in the presence of Arteshanand and Sudevanand that it was such a
place from where it would be impossible to run away/escape after killing
Gaffoor Sahib. He visited Bungalow of Abdul Gaffoor a week before 29.12.1973
at 04.00 or 05.00 PM.
224\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 replied that after seeing the photograph,
he had seen Abdul Gaffoor in person at his residence. There was no register
maintained at the entrance of his residence for making entries by the
visitors. There was no "Pass" system at his residence. He did not remember the
date of his visit to the residence CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 302 of Abdul Gaffoor
but he visited him prior to his stay in Republic Hotel. He has not stated in
detail before the Magistrate that Santoshanand told him that it would take
time for Vinayanand to come back and in the meantime he should follow Abdul
Gaffoor but it was not found mentioned in his statement Ex.PW-1/X. He replied
that he has not stated that accompanied by Sudevanand and Arteshanand, he went
to the places in the vicinity of area where Abdul Gaffoor was residing and on
returning he informed Santoshanand that he had acquainted himself with the
surroundings. He answered that he told Santoshanand that it would not be
possible to run away after killing Abdul Gaffoor as the place was well
guarded. He further testified that he did not try to read the nameplate of the
occupant of the adjacent bungalow of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor. On the right side of
the bungalow of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, there passes a road and on the left side,
there was a bungalow. He did not know the name of that road. That link road
meets the main road, which leads to the Secretariat. There was a bungalow
across the link road and as far as he remembers, those bungalows were of the
Ministers. He has denied the suggestion that those are the private bungalows
near the bungalow of Abdul Gaffoor. He had not seen Mr. Abdul Gaffoor coming
in and going from the kothi but he had seen him present in his bungalow. He
did not remember the date when he saw Abdul Gaffoor present in his bungalow
but it was before 29.12.1973 and time was 4.00 or 5.00 P.M. when he saw him.
He has denied the suggestion that he had CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 303 never gone to the
bungalow of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, that he had not seen him, or that he had made a
false statement. He admitted that there was a police guard outside at the
entrance. He did not try to know whether there was any reception. He had not
tried to seek an interview with the Chief Minister. He had gone inside his
bungalow. He had not taken any prior permission from his private secretary to
go in. He clarified that he went there during usual interview timings fixed
for the meeting the public. There were 20 or 25 persons present there waiting
for an interview with the Chief Minister. He had seen 2 or 3 persons sitting
with him. He did not know any person present there. He remained there waiting
until Mr. Gaffoor came out to the room into the lawn. He continued to wait
there for 1-1/2 hour. He replied that there might be system of recording entry
of the visitors in the register and obtaining of their signatures at the main
gate and he had no concern with that as he went there during public time to
see the Chief Minister. He did not know if this register is also filled up
during public meeting time. He could not remember the day of the week when he
visited there. He saw 7-8 police officials in uniform. He went to the
residence of Chief Minister in a dress of a businessman under the instructions
of Santoshanand. He was instructed by Santoshanand to talk to the Chief
Minister, if necessary to say that he wanted to open a factory and in that
connection, he wanted his assistance to get land. He answered that had he been
apprehended, he would have given the same excuse. He did not take any paper
with CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 304 him. He did not state in his statement under Section
164 of the Cr. PC that he was asked by Santoshanand to go in the guise of a
businessperson and survey the situation from the point of view of action. He
did not carry any arm with him when he went to have a look of the Chief
Minister.
225\. There is no cross-examination as regards A-1 deputing PW-1 to track the
movements of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor. The defence has not discredited PW-1 that
accused Santoshanand brought a photograph of Abdul Gaffoor from the office of
newspaper either 'PRADEEP' or 'Vishwabandhu'. The defence has also not derided
the statement of PW-1 that father of Santoshanand was working in the editorial
staff of these papers or that PW-1 saw the photograph of Abdul Gaffoor and
kept the same in the house at Gulzar Bagh. The defence has also failed to
dispute that PW-1 along with Sudevanand and Arteshanand, went to the place in
the area where Abdul Gaffoor was residing. Therefore the testimony of PW-1 on
these vital points goes unchallenged and could not be demolished or belied and
the same is creditworthy.
226\. PW-33 Sh. Ujjawal Prakash, whose testimony as regards his association
with Anand Marg, being familiar with the organization and its publications and
acquaintance with A-1 at Delhi as Editor is already discussed in the previous
captions. What is relevant for the present is that the original name of
accused Santoshanand was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 305 Ghanshyam Prasad son of Narinder
Narain Verma, who was an employee of LIC and was also a Journalist working
with the newspaper Vishwabandhu, at Patna. PW-33 identified A-1 in the court
and deposed that he used to meet A-1 at Maha Chakra held in Patna. There is no
iota to discredit in cross-examination of PW-33 on these points and his
testimony is unshaken. Witness replied that father of A- 1 used to work in LIC
as well as a journalist with "Vishwabandhu". Judicial notice of the fact can
be taken note of that LIC of India has its lacs of agents throughout the
country and they are not on the rolls of LIC and for that reason Ghanshyam
Prasad worked as a freelancer to "Vishwabandhu" and "PRADEEP". PW-33 has also
identified the A- 1 in the court correctly and his capability to identify A-1
is not questioned. Therefore, testimony of PW-33 cannot be doubted.
227\. In order to prove that accused Santoshanand brought a photograph of
Abdul Gaffoor from the newspaper "PRADEEP" or "Vishwabandhu" as stated by
PW-1, the prosecution examined PW- 143 Ram Naresh Prasad, the then
Advertisement Manager of Newspaper 'Vishwabandhu' published from Bihar during
the period from 1972 to 1976. He testified that their newspaper "Vishwabandhu"
is published from Bihar. Its publication is very old. He worked there as
Advertisement Manager from 1972 to 1976. He deposed that photograph of Sh.
Abdul Gaffoor used to be printed in their newspaper. The source of getting the
photograph was Public Relations Department of Government of Bihar. Sh. N.N.
Verma was part-time CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 306 worker with this Hindi daily
newspaper 'Vishwabandhu'. He had seen Sh. N.N. Verma working in the newspaper
during the period. In his cross-examination, he deposed that Sh. A.K. Sinha
was owner of this Hindu Newspaper. He was also Editor and Manager. He admitted
that he was not receiving the photographs and their blocks. These used to be
received by Sh. A.K. Sinha. Whenever required, Sh. A.K. Sinha himself used to
get prepared the blocks of photos and these blocks used to be in custody of
A.K. Sinha. These could not be taken out of the premises. In his presence,
blocks of Photo of Abdul Gaffoor were not received in the office. The defence
could not shatter the testimony that photo of Abdul Gaffoor used to be
published in the newspaper "Vishwabandhu" and Sh. N.N. Verma was a part time
worker there. Thus testimony of PW-1 is corroborated to the effect that
accused Santoshanand brought the photograph of Abdul Gaffoor from the
newspaper office either 'PRADEEP' or 'Vishwabandhu' where his father was
working. Admittedly, Sh. N.N. Verma is father of accused Santoshanand.
228\. However, to demolish the testimony of PW-33, A-1 examined his brother
Sh. Sushil Kumar s/o Narender Narain Verma as DW-9 on the points of avocation
of his father. This witness conveniently stated that his father was working
with National Insurance Company Limited without filing any document. He
claimed that his father had retired in 1978\. His elder brother was 20-21
years older to him and his parents informed him that his elder brother had
left the house when he was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 307 about 18-20 months old and
he cannot recognize his elder brother who became a Sanyasi. He stated his date
of birth as 17.08.1962. In his cross-examination, he stated that name of his
brother was Ghanshyam Prasad. He has denied the suggestion that his father was
working in the editorial staff of "PRADEEP" newspaper published from Patna. He
has not filed letter of appointment or salary slip etc. to indicate that his
father (Narinder Narain Verma) was working with National Insurance Company
Limited and retired there. Instead of examining DW-9, accused Santoshanand
could have examined the Officer of National Insurance Company Limited, which
is a subsidiary company of General Insurance Corporation of India, a
Government of India undertaking to prove the alleged employment of his father
there in order to demolish the case of the prosecution. A careful scrutiny of
the deposition of this witness shows that his statement is superfluous and
peripheral in so far as not extirpating the role of Santoshanand since DW-9
has no trace of knowledge concerning the activities of his brother who severed
the ties and left the home, while DW-9 was still a child of less than of 2
years. Rather he corroborates the version of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-33 that
original name of accused Santoshanand was Ghanshyam Prasad and his father's
name was Narinder Narain Verma.
229\. From the examination-in-chief as well as cross-examination of DW-9 one
fact remains certain that A-1 is known as Ghanshyam Prashad with his maiden
name and the parentage is confirmed. There CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 308 is no
material to believe that the father of A-1 was not a freelancer with
"Vishwabandhu" or "PRADEEP".
230\. There is no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel that the
prosecution has not seized the visitor register at the reception of the
residence of the then Chief Minister Abdul Gaffoor if any person by the name
of Madan Mohan Srivastava or Visheshwaranand has visited there in the month of
December 1973. PW-1 has clarified that he has gone to visit the Chief Minister
at the time when it was meant for public meeting. There is also no force in
the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel that Abdul Gaffoor was not examined by
the prosecution to prove whether he had any threat perception from any member
of Anand Marg Organisation. There was no necessity of examining Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor as a prosecution witness since the motives of conspirators were
admittedly not known to Abdul Gaffoor. It is a settled principle of law that
conspiracy is hatched in secrecy. The conspirators have decided to kill
certain persons including Madhavanand, Abdul Gaffoor, Sh. L.N. Mishra and
others only with the purpose to pressurize the government to release their
cult head, who had been in prison since December, 1971 and they had no
personal enmity with Abdul Gaffoor. She also argued that the photograph of the
Chief Minister of a State is easily available and is displayed in public
places and PW-1 could be believed to say that he told Santoshanand that he had
not seen Abdul Gaffoor and he should be shown to him. It has already come in
the testimony of PW-143 that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 309 photographs of Abdul Gaffoor
used to be published in their publication "Vishwabandhu" and Sh. N.N. Verma
was a freelancer there. Sh. N.N. Verma is none but the father of accused
Santoshanand. PW-33 has also deposed so, therefore the testimony of PW-1
inspires confidence that Santoshanand brought a photograph of Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor from the newspaper "PRADEEP" or "Vishwabandhu", where his father was
working on the editorial staff. The accused persons including Santoshanand
have not at all shattered the testimony of PW- 1 that the father of
Santoshanand was working in the editorial staff of "PRADEEP" or "Vishwabandhu"
from where Santoshanand brought a Photograph of Abdul Gaffoor and handed over
the same to him. Thus, the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel falls to the
ground. Moreover, the deposition of PW-1 of having seen the photo of CM and
later tracking his movements, corroborated by the testimony of PW-143, who
deposed that their publication used to get photographs from PRD of Bihar,
being the main fact in issue, the mere defence that PW-1 deposed falsehood of
the source of the photograph melts into the background.
231\. PW-1 further testified that Santoshanand then enquired whether Abdul
Gaffoor used to come to Republic Hotel. PW-1 went there to ascertain whether
Abdul Gaffoor would be visiting the hotel or not. PW-1 also stayed there on
the night of 29.12.1973 under the assumed name of Shankar Kumar Gupta. He
signed the entry in the register of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 310 the hotel as S.K.
Gupta of Karol Bagh, Delhi. He proved the entry of his stay in the Republic
Hotel to be in his own handwriting Ex.PW-1/P and he mentioned his name as
Shankar Kumar Gupta (Q-8) of S-8/19, S.W.A. Karol Bagh, Delhi and he signed as
S.K. Gupta. He had taken balance from the Hotel on 30.12.1973 after a
deduction of Rs.40/- vide Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R (Q9) bearing his signatures
as S.K. Gupta.
232\. In the cross-examination of PW-1, it is found that he did not know the
name of Manager of Republic Hotel as there was no need to know his name. He
did not know name of any bearer of Republic Hotel. He could not say the exact
time when he checked in the Republic Hotel and at what time, he left but he
deposed that it was before sunset on 29.12.1973 and left in the morning next
day. He did not remember the room number in which he stayed. He did not
remember if he had noted time of arrival and departure. In his further cross-
examination, PW-1 has denied the suggestion that the Hotel Register and Inn-
Register are forged documents. He has also denied the suggestion that the
entries did not exist or had been sandwiched/ interpolated subsequently. In
his further cross-examination, PW-1 replied that he enquired about the arrival
of Abdul Gaffoor at Republic Hotel from the Bearer. It is worthwhile to
mention here that visit of PW-1 to Hotel Republic, Patna on 29.12.1973 under
pseudonyms of Shankar Kumar Gupta or S.K. Gupta is not shaken in his cross-
examination by the defence.

234\. PW-16 Sh. Lakshman Prasad, Barman in Republic Hotel, Patna testified
that he has been working as Barman in the Republic Hotel, Patna since 1955. He
deposed that Abdul Gaffoor was previously Chief Minister of Bihar and he knew
him by face. Earlier he was MLC. He knew him even after becoming Chief
Minister of Bihar. He visited Republic Hotel once or twice after becoming
Chief Minister of Bihar. He used to visit to meet some persons staying in the
Hotel. Abdul Gaffoor used to visit Sh. R.K. Gupta of Ludhiana during his stay
in the Hotel.
235\. In his cross-examination, PW-16 replied that he had seen him last time
after 2/3 years in the year 1974-75. This corroborates the information, which
accused Santoshanand conveyed to PW1 to the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 312 effect that
the then Chief Minister Abdul Gaffoor used to visit Republic Hotel at Patna.
He testified that there has been no Head Barman or Head Bearer in the Republic
Hotel. He did not state to CBI that he was a Head Bearer. He replied that
Abdul Gaffoor did not take liquor in the Hotel. He never served Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor with liquor. His duty hours in the H otel were from 10.00 AM to 10.00
PM. Liquor remains in the custody of Barman and not in his custody. He
answered that Sh. Abdul Gaffoor was aged about 42/44 years, when he had seen
him for the first time. He did not remember the number of the room of the
Hotel in which he had seen Sh. Abdul Gaffoor for the last time in 1974-1975.
He could not tell the date or month of having seen Abdul Gaffoor. Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor used to take Lime Water or Limca or Coca Cola. He was not aware
whether Abdul Gaffoor was diabetic. He had not seen him actually taking Coca
Cola etc., as after serving him the said drinks, he used to come out. Abdul
Gaffoor never gave him any tip. Abdul Gaffoor used to visit the Hotel only for
meeting and for no other purpose. His stay in the Hotel would be for about
half an hour or an hour. He might have visited the hotel two or four times in
all during the period of three or four years. It was not necessary that Sh.
Abdul Gaffoor would visit Republic Hotel on each occasion when Sh. R.K. Gupta
of Ludhiana was staying there. There used to be entries about stay of Sh. R.K.
Gupta in Hotel Republic. He testified that when a stranger comes to Hotel
Republic with some luggage, advance is taken from him. They do not charge any
advance CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 313 from the person known to them. If the rent of
the room is Rs.25/-, a sum of Rs.50/- used to be taken as advance. He
testified that a bill is prepared when a customer leaves the Hotel. A receipt
is given to the person at the time of taking advance from him. They do not
obtain signature of the person-paying advance and rather receipt is issued to
him. Normally, signatures of stranger staying in the Hotel are taken on the
bills. He replied that no prior intimation was given to their Hotel about the
intending visits of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, when he was the Chief Minister. Police
were not making any arrangement in the Hotel before the visit of Sh. Gaffoor
there. He also did not have any prior information about the intending visit of
Sh. Abdul Gaffoor to the Hotel Republic on any particular date. He was not
introduced to Sh. Abdul Gaffoor by anyone. He answered that Sh. Abdul Gaffoor
never called him by his name. Sh. Abdul Gaffoor was about five and an half
feet in height, medium built; Sanwala colour and his hairs were grey and
black, dressed backside. He used not to wear any cap. Every time Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor used to visit Hotel Republic to meet Sh. R.K. Gupta. It is elicited in
his cross-examination that once upon a time, Sh. Abdul Gaffoor came to Hotel
Republic along with Kashi Babu to meet Sh. R.K. Gupta. Sh. Gaffoor used to
visit Hotel Republic on the invitations of his friends like Sh. Raj Kumar
Gupta of Ludhiana and Sh. Kashi Babu of Eliphstan Cinema Hall. He did not
state in his previous statement to CBI that Sh. Abdul Gaffoor used to visit
Hotel Republic several times on invitation of many persons.

236\. A scrutiny of the deposition of PW-16 reflects that in his examination-
in-chief he has testified that he has been working as a barman in Hotel
Republic since 1955. He knew by face Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, former Chief Minister
of Bihar. Sh. Abdul Gaffoor was earlier an MLC and used to visit Hotel
Republic. He used to visit the hotel to meet some persons like Sh. R.K. Gupta
of Ludhiana, staying in the Hotel. After he became Chief Minister, he visited
there once or twice. In his examination in chief, he has used the word "used
to visit" for the visit of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, Chief Minister, which indicate
that Sh. Abdul Gaffoor has been a frequent visitor. In his cross-examination,
it is elicited that he lastly saw him in the year 1974-75 after two or three
years. The line of answers of the witness in the cross-examination indicate
that he knew Sh. Abdul Gaffoor very well and he informed his height, body
built, complexion and colour of the hair and dressing style. The defence
themselves got elicited the visits of Abdul Gaffoor to Hotel Republic in
cross-examination of the witness, which solidifies the version of the
prosecution. The witness had also seen him in October/November, 1975 visiting
Hotel Republic. The testimony of the witness could not be discarded if he
could not remember the date and month of visit of Sh. Gaffoor in the Hotel. As
per the case of the prosecution, PW-1 has stayed in Hotel Republic on the
night of 29.12.1973 to ascertain whether Sh. Abdul Gaffoor would be staying
and taking his meal in Hotel Republic. In his examination in chief, PW-16
supported the case of the prosecution, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 315 when he stated
that he knew Sh. Abdul Gaffoor, former MLC and later became CM of Bihar and
used to visit Hotel Republic to meet some persons like Sh. R.K. Gupta. PW-16
had seen him visiting the Hotel even in subsequent years 1974-75 and in
October/November, 1975. PW-1 had gone there only to ascertain whether Abdul
Gaffoor would be staying and taking his meal in the Hotel and the answers to
the questions in the cross-examination, corroborates the case of the
prosecution that Abdul Gaffoor has visited even subsequently. It is a matter
of common prudence that when a very important person like Abdul Gaffoor, a
former MLC and Chief Minister visit any particular place, it makes an
impression in the mind of the public at large that such very important person
might be a frequent visitor at that place. Obviously, accused Santoshanand
under that impression deputed PW- 1 to ascertain staying and taking of meal by
Sh. Abdul Gaffoor in Hotel Republic. In the cross-examination of PW-16, the
defence has not discredited the visits of Abdul Gaffoor in Hotel Republic in
the year 1973 or before that. The testimony of PW-16 as a whole has not been
discredited. As per the deposition of PW-16, Abdul Gaffoor has been a frequent
visitor to Hotel Republic and this corroborates the information which accused
Santoshanand conveyed to PW1 to the effect that Abdul Gaffoor used to visit
Republic Hotel at Patna.
237\. PW-17 Sh. Sudershan Banerjee testified that in December 1973, he was
working at reception of Hotel Republic and during the night intervening 29th
and 30th December 1973, he was on duty at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 316 Reception. He
deposed that whenever a stranger comes to Hotel Republic for the first time,
they used to take advance from him. The visitor to Hotel Republic used to make
entry in the Visitor's Register in his own hand. Memos are prepared with
regard to the meals served to the customer staying in the Hotel. In case,
amount of advance taken from the customer was more than the expenses, voucher
used to be prepared to refund the excess amount. He further deposed that Sh.
H.K. Singha used to work with him in the hotel at the reception during the
period he was employed there. He had seen him (Sh. H.K. Singha) writing and
signing and he would be in a position to identify his handwriting and
signatures. The witness (PW-17) had seen the carbon copy of bill Ex.PW-17/A
and identified the writing on Ex.PW-17/A-1 to be in the handwriting of Sh.
H.K. Singha. He also testified that the writing encircled with red pencil on
Ex.PW-17/A is also in the handwriting of Sh. H.K. Singha. He identified his
own handwriting on Ex.PW-17/A encircled with blue pencil with his initials
also. He testified that Sh. H.K. Singha was on duty before him on that day and
Mr. Sher Khil took over from him as a Receptionist on 30.12.1973. Sh. Sher
Khil had also worked with him and seen him writing and signing and for that
reason, he could identify his handwriting and signature. At the time of
deposition in the court, this witness has also seen the document and deposed
that the point A-2, A-3 and A-4 on Ex.PW-17/A are in the handwriting of Sh.
Sher Khil and at the foot of A-2 and A-4, he identified the signatures of Sh.
Sher Khil. He was not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 317 aware of the whereabouts of Sh.
Sher Khil. The said bill was prepared in accordance with the entries made in
the Register. He testified that entry Ex.PW-1/P was found existing in the
Visitor's Register when he joined duties as a Receptionist on 29.12.1973 at
10.00 PM. After perusing the Voucher Ex.PW-1/R, PW-17 stated that this is in
the handwriting of said Sher Khil. About Sh. H.K. Singha he stated that he
might be about 72 or 75 years old and was a heart patient.
238\. In the cross-examination of PW-17, he replied that the page having the
entry Ex.PW-1/P must have been in the Register and from there it must have
been taken out. A Visitor coming to the Hotel sign s in the Visitor's Register
and entry is made therein by the Visitor and they would insist in obtaining
the signature of the Visitors on the entry made by the Visitor in the Visitors
Register. He identified the entry Ex.PW-1/P at Serial No. 8025 in the
handwriting of Sh. H.K. Singha. He clarified that the entry in the Visitor
Register in respect of a person coming earlier would be made first and in
respect of a person, coming subsequently would be made later. A receipt was
used to be given to a customer at the time of taking advance from him and a
carbon copy thereof was used to be prepared. In the Cash Voucher, the number
of the receipt regarding the advance is mentioned. After perusing the Cash
Voucher Ex.PW-1/R, he deposed that number of advance receipt is not mentioned,
but reference of bill number is there. The Manager passes the vouchers and
then those are sent in the account section. Ms. Ghosh was working as an
Accountant in the Republic Hotel in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 318 those days and he
identified her signatures at Point A on the Voucher Ex.PW-1/R. He replied that
Bill Ex.PW-17/A bears his own handwriting made at 10.00 PM on 29.12.1973,
which indicate that he was on duty at that time. It bears his initial on this
bill. He has also identified the entry in the visitors register Ex.PW-1/P,
which is a part of right side of the visitors register and has been separately
exhibited as Ex.PW-1/Q. (Ex.PW-17/A is a bill no. 8025 of Hotel Republic which
was issued in the name of Sh. Shankar Kumar Gupta on 30.12.1973. This is
available in the bound Bill Book of Republic Hotel in Folder R-47). (Sheet of
Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q (having questioned writing Q-8) is
available in Folder R-
7).
239\. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the prosecution has not examined Sh.
H.K. Singha and Mr. Sher Khil, Receptionist to prove the Bill and Voucher.
There is no need to bring any more evidence which becomes superfluous to
formulate that the CM visited the Hotel Republic and PW-1 having tracked him.
There is no merit in their arguments since PW-17 has not only identified the
handwriting of Sh. H.K. Singha on Bill Ex.PW-17/A but also his own handwriting
encircled with blue pencil and his initials. He has also identified the
handwriting of Ms. Ghosh, Accountant and Sh. Sher Khil, Receptionist. It is
not suggested in the cross-examination of PW-17 that he had not seen Mr.
Singha or Mr. Sher Khil or Ms. Ghosh writing and signing. The testimony of
PW-17 could not be demolished CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 319 in cross-examination by the
defence on any of the point deposed by him. While dissecting his testimony
this court finds the same to be trustworthy.
240\. PW-147 Mr. Clifford Boile, the then Manager of Hotel Republic, Patna
deposed that from January 1975 to June 1976, he had worked as Manager, Hotel
Republic, Patna. Earlier also he had worked there as Assistant Manager from
1959 to 1961 and as Manager from 1961 to 1962. He deposed that they were
maintaining a Visitor's Register in Hotel Republic, Patna. Whenever a visitor
came to their Hotel for stay, the person present at the reception, used to
make inquiry from him as to for how long he intended to stay and what type of
accommodation was needed by him. On being satisfied, the visitor used to make
entries in the Visitor's Register in his own handwriting. The Visitor Register
used to be a bound register. He testified that most of the visitors in Hotel
Republic were regular visitors. Whenever a visitor was not a regular one, he
was required to deposit advance at the time of getting accommodation and this
advance used to vary depending on the type of accommodation required by him.
PW-147 further testified that the document (D-49) having entry Ex.PW-1/P and
besides other entries bear his signature at Point 'B' (two places) on two
pages with date 03.05.1975. He had also seen the Cash Voucher dated 30.12.1973
of Hotel Republic, Patna Ex.PW-1/R and it bears his signatures at two places C
and D with date appended under both the signature in his handwriting. Vide
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-134/A, he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 320 handed over sheet from the
Visitor's Register having entry Ex.PW-1/P and Bill Ex.PW-17/A contained in the
Bill Book having Bill nos. 8001 to 8100. He deposed that Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-134/A bears his signature at point B. He asserted that Bill Ex.PW-17/A
was contained in this Bill Book, when it was handed over by him to the CBI
Officers. At that time, he has signed the Bill Ex.PW-17/A, bearing Bill No.
8025 at point F with date 03.05.1975. He stated that in fact these bills were
given to Bihar Police. In his further statement, he deposed that police
officers asked him entire Visitor Register, but he did not give the register,
as it was required for audit purposes. He himself took out the page having
entry Ex.PW-1/P from the Visitor's Register and signed this sheet of Visitors
Book having entry Ex.PW-1/P at the time it was given to the Police Officer. He
further deposed that Seizure Memo dated 19.9.1975 Ex.PW-129/B bears his
signature at point 'A'. Vide this Seizure Memo he handed over Cash Voucher
Ex.PW-1/R to the Police on 19.09.1975. He signed the Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R at
point 'C' at the time it was handed over to the Police Officer. He explained
that he did not part with this Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R on 03.05.1975 since he
was to obtain permission from the Accounts Officer. However, on 03.05.1975, he
had shown this Cash Voucher No. 4 Ex.PW-1/R to the Bihar Police Officer and at
that time, he and Bihar Police Officer had signed this document. He confirmed
that Sh. H.K. Singha and Sh. S. Banerjee (PW-17) and Devashish Sher Khil were
working as Receptionist in Hotel Republic in the year 1975. He CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 321 also testified that whenever amount was obtained from a visitor
as advance, a receipt was issued to him. If at the time of checking out of
that customer, he was to pay charges, more than the amount of advance, they
used to obtain balance amount from him and in case the amount was less, they
used to return the balance amount against the Cash Voucher No. 4. At the time
of deposition in the court, the witness has seen the Cash Voucher No. 4
Ex.PW-1/R and asserted that it was in the handwriting of Devashish Sher Khil.
He deposed that he was familiar with his handwriting and signatures, as he had
seen Sher Khil writing and signing, while he was working under him. The
witness has also seen the portion Mark A-2, A-3 and A-4, encircled with red
pencil, on Bill No. 8025 Ex.PW-17/A and stated that this was in the
handwriting of Sh. Devashish Sher Khil. He deposed that he had seen Sh. H.K.
Singha writing and signing, since he was working under him. He also identified
that that the portion X1 and X2 on the said Bill Ex.PW-17/A are in the
handwriting of Sh. H.K. Singha. (Seizure Memo Ex.PW-129/B by which Cash
Voucher No. 4 of 30.12.1973 of Hotel Republic was seized by PW-129 Sh. N.N.
Singh from Mr. Clifford Boile (PW-147) is available in Folder R-2)
241\. In his cross-examination, PW-147 replied that there used to be one
person on duty at the Reception at one time. The accounts office was located
on the ground floor and that of the Manager on the first floor. The bills of
the guests used to be prepared at the Reception. One copy of the bill used to
be given to the customer and another used CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 322 to be sent to
accounts section. The bill book and third copy used to be kept at the
Reception Counter under the control of the Manager. Visitor's Register used to
be maintained at the Reception. At the time when he handed over the documents
to the Bihar Police Officer, he signed the first and last page of the
Visitor's Register. The Bihar Police Officer came to him in his room and he
did not contact any of the before said person. He deposed that Receptionist is
not required to fill all the columns of the Visitor's Register. He admitted
that on the sheet of Visitors Register serial numbers are not mentioned
despite having relevant column. He has denied the suggestion that the entry
Ex.PW-1/P is a bogus one or was incorporated subsequently or that it was not a
part of the Visitors Register. He stated voluntarily that there is a printing
of page number on this document (Ex.PW-1/P). In his further cross-examination,
PW-147 answered that the Bill Book (D-
154) was regularly maintained. He admitted that in this Bill Book, bill no.
8031 relates to check out dated 2.1.1973 and bill no. 8032 relates to check
out dated 31.12.1973. He also admitted that the Bill No. 8034 relates to check
out dated 03.01.1974, whereas the Bill No. 8035 and 8036 relates to check out
dated 01.01.1975. He also admitted that the Bill No. 8019 in the Bill Book
(D-154) relates to the check out date 02.01.1973 and the Bill No. 8025
Ex.PW-17/A relates to check out date 30.12.1973. He has denied the suggestion
that between 30.12.1973 and 02.01.1974 only five persons checked out in Hotel
Republic, Patna. He admitted that the Bills are prepared date-wise in CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 323 respect of the customer, who checks in the Hotel Republic, Patna.
He has denied the suggestion that this Bill Book was not regularly maintained
or that he has made tutored statement. He deposed that the month April to
March is used to be their accounting year and closing year in respect of this
entry would be 31st March 1974. The audit of accounting period April 1973 to
March 1974 was done by the end of the year 1974. He asserted that Visitor
Register was not maintained year-wise. A new register is used to start when
the previous register was completely written or if the earlier register got
torn off. Normally a Visitor Register used to be completed in 1½ or 2 years.
As far as he remembered, the sheet of the Visitor Register, given to the
police, was taken out from the Visitor Register, which was started in the year
1972 and it continued to contain entries until 1974. He further asserted that
he informed the Bihar Police Officer that it was a running Visitor Register
and it was still required for audit purposes. He replied that he handed over
the original Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R to the Police as it was no more required
for audit purposes. He has denied the suggestion that Cash Book and Vouchers
are audited separately. He answered that both are audited simultaneously. He
has denied the suggestion that CBI officer did not ask for the Visitor
Register from which the sheet was given to Bihar Police Officer. They have
preserved the Visitor's Book. It must be lying in the Hotel Republic, Patna
even now. He remembered that Police Officer asked him to preserve the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 324 Visitor's Book as the same might be required. Voucher Ex.PW-1/R
is available in Folder R-4.
242\. Perusal of the testimony of PW-147 reflects that the same could not be
shaken in his cross-examination. This witness has also proved the handwriting
and signatures of Sh. Sher Khil and Mr. H.K. Singha on the Bill Ex.PW-17/A and
of Mr. Sher Khil on the Voucher Ex.PW- 1/R. His deposition that they required
the Visitor's Register for audit purpose as it was a running register, has not
been shaken by the defence in his cross- examination. The deposition of PW-47
that he himself took out the page having entry Ex.PW-1/P from the Visitor's
Register and signed this sheet of Visitors Book having entry Ex.PW- 1/P at the
time it was given to the Police Officer, is also not discredited in his cross-
examination by any of the accused persons. His testimony that the Visitor
Register was not maintained year-wise, and a new register is used to start
when the previous register was completely written or if the earlier register
got torn off, is not at all shattered by the defence.
243\. PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha deposed that in February 1974 he was posted as
Inspector with Intelligence Branch, also known as Special Branch, of Bihar
Police with Headquarter at Patna. He testified that on 29.4.1975, on receiving
information from Deputy SP C.D. Prasad upon which he went his house and found
Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand @ Vijay (PW-1) there and arrested CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 325 him on the same day. He produced him before CJM,
Patna on the same day. On obtaining his police remand, he interrogated PW-1
and recorded the statement of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava in his case diary.
He interrogated him from 30.04.1975 to 03.05.1975 and recorded his statement
on 03.05.1975. On interrogation, he (PW-1) disclosed that he made an entry in
the register of Hotel Republic, Patna as 'Shankar Kumar Gupta' on 29.12.1973
and signed that entry as 'Shankar Kumar Gupta'. He also testified that PW-1
disclosed to him that he signed Cash Voucher of the Hotel Republic as 'Shankar
Kumar Gupta'. He further testified that on the same day i.e. 03.5.1975 at
about 4.00 PM, he went to Hotel Republic, Patna and asked for the production
of Visitors' Register, Cash Voucher and Bills in respect of Shankar Kumar
Gupta for 29.12.1973. Two sheets of Register were produced before him
containing the entries Ex.PW-1/Q and Ex.PW- 1/P and he put the signatures on
both these sheets at that time. The Hotel Manager Mr. Clifford Boile (PW-147)
at point "B" also signed these sheets in his presence. He also deposed that
Refund Voucher Ex.PW-1/R was also produced before him by the Manager, which he
signed at Point A and Manager Clifford Boile (PW-147) signed at point B in his
presence. He deposed that entry Mark Q-8, signatures Q-9 of S.K. Gupta also
existed on two sheets Mark D-49 at the time the same were seized by him and it
was one continuing sheet, which he took into possession from the Visitor's
Register. He did not take into possession complete Visitor's Register due to
request of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 326 Manager that it was a running register. He
deposed that the Manager did not give him the voucher though it was signed by
him and he (PW-
134) instructed the Manager that the voucher should be preserved. He also
deposed that Bill Book containing serial No. 8001 to 8100 was shown to him by
the Manager, in which he found a Bill Ex.PW-17/A in the name of Shankar Kumar
Gupta at serial no. 8025 dated 30.12.1973. He (PW-134) signed the first page
at point A and on the last page at point B and on the bill no. 8025 Ex.PW-17/A
at point C contained in the bill book. He obtained signatures of Mr. Clifford
Boile (PW-147) at point D, E and F on the first page, last page and bill no.
8025 of the said bill book. He prepared a Seizure Memo Ex.PW- 134/A on
3.5.1975 in respect of the sheets and bill book (containing Bill Ex.PW-17/A)
and the Seizure Memo bear his signatures at point A and of Clifford Boile
(PW-147) at point B. He has showed this document as a receipt.
244\. In his cross-examination, PW-134 replied that he did not take any step
to get Madan Mohan Srivastava identified from the employees of Hotel Republic,
Patna to find out whether he was the same person, who stayed in Hotel
Republic, Patna under the name of Shankar Kumar Gupta. He did not take Sh.
Madan Mohan Srivastava along with him, as he knew the location of Hotel
Republic, Patna. It is a well-known Hotel of Patna. He answered that since the
Manager expressed his difficulty in parting with the register, which was a
running one, so he seized only the page having the relevant entry CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 327 against a valid receipt and gave a direction to the Manager to
preserve the whole of the register. He admitted that relevant entry is the
last entry for 29.12.1973 on the sheet. He testified that the Manager, Hotel
Republic, Patna gave the relevant sheet to him, after he removed it from the
Visitor's Register. The witness was shown the relevant entry Ex.PW-1/P on
which he did not find page number. He explained that the sheet is now in torn
condition. The receipt of taking into possession the documents from Hotel
Republic, Patna was got typed in the Hotel. He did not take into possession
the Refund Voucher Ex. PW-1/R and he left it in the hotel after he initialed
the same. He made a request to the Manager to handover the Refund Voucher, who
expressed his inability as it pertained to account department and on that
account, he directed him in writing that it should be preserved. He admitted
that Bill No. 8025 is dated 30.12.1973 and while Bill No. 8026 is dated
05.01.1974. He also admitted that Bill No. 8027 is dated 31.12.1973 and 8030
is dated 01.01.1973. He further admitted that Bill No. 8031 is dated
02.01.1973 and while Bill No. 8032 is dated 31.12.1973. He further admitted
that Bill No. 8034 is dated 03.01.1974 and while Bill No. 8035 is dated
01.01.1974. In his further cross-examination, PW-134 denied the suggestion of
the defence that he took Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand (PW-1) to
his house and kept him there for two or three days. He had denied the
suggestion that he came to know of the particulars of Visheshwaranand on
10.02.1974. He volunteered to state that he was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 328 not
the investigation officer on 10.02.1974 and the investigation of this case was
entrusted to him on 28.02.1974. In his further cross- examination, PW-134
testified that Madan Mohan Srivastava was allowed bail on 08.05.1975 and his
statement was recorded under Section 164 of Cr. PC on 12.05.1975. He remained
under interrogation until 07.05.1975. He has denied the suggestion that a deal
was struck with Madan Mohan Srivastava to make a statement on the condition
that he would be allowed to rejoin his post, which he left in 1964. He deposed
that Deputy S.P. Sh. Jata Shankar Khan of Intelligence Branch, Darbhanga,
apprehended Visheshwaranand. (Seizure Memo dated 03.05.1975 Ex.PW-134/A, by
which Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134) has seized Full Page No. 187 of the Visitor's

Shankar Kumar Gupta, were seized from Mr. C. Boile, Manager of Hotel Republic,
Patna, is available in Folder R-5)
245\. I have already referred in previous part of this judgment about PW-126A
Sh. Maheshwar Prasad with whom PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava had worked from the
year 1961 to 1975. This witness has also identified the signatures of PW-1
Madan Mohan Srivastava as S.K. Gupta Ex.PW-1/Q in the sheet of Hotel Republic.
He deposed CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 329 that these are the signatures in the handwriting
of Madan Mohan Srivastava. In his deposition, the sheet of the Hotel Republic
was mentioned as Ex.PW-1/T instead of Ex.PW-1/P, which appears to be a
clerical/typographical error. He has also identified signatures Ex.PW- 1/R
(Q-9) on the Cash Voucher and deposed that these are in the handwriting of
Madan Mohan Srivastava. He replied that writing at Point 'X' encircled with
blue ink on Ex.PW-1/R is not in the handwriting of Madan Mohan Srivastava. No
other writing and signature of PW-1 was questioned by the defence. Competency
of this witness to identify the writing or signatures was never discredited by
the defence. Hence, this unchallenged testimony of PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar
Prasad corroborates the deposition of PW-1 that he stayed in Hotel Republic
under assumed name of Shankar Kumar Gupta, which is corroborated further with
the testimony of PW-134.
246\. PW-129 Sh. Narinder Nath Singh, the then Inspector, CBI at Patna stated
that he remained associated with the investigation of this case from March
1975 to November 1975 under the direction and supervision of the Chief
Investigating Officer, Sh. H.L. Ahuja. He deposed that he visited Hotel
Republic during the investigation of this case on 19.9.1975 and seized one
Voucher Ex.PW-1/R (D-15) from Mr. Clifford Boile (PW-147), Manager of the
Hotel vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-129/B, which was signed by the Manager Mr. Boile
at point 'A'. In his cross-examination, PW-129 answered that he did not CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 330 seize any other document except the Cash Voucher
Ex.PW-1/R from Hotel Republic. He further deposed that this Refund Voucher
Ex.PW- 1/R also relates to stay of Shankar Kumar Gupta. He has mentioned the
date of the Voucher in his case diary as 30.12.1973. At the time of taking
into possession Voucher Ex.PW-1/R, he did not know who this S.K. Gupta was. He
came to know about Sh. S.K. Gupta within a month of taking into possession the
Voucher Ex.PW-1/R. Sh. S.K. Gupta was the pseudonym of Madan Mohan Srivastava.
He met him after taking into possession Ex.PW-1/R. He admitted that in the
seizure memo Ex.PW-129/B the bill number was mentioned as 4025 instead of 8025
due to clerical mistake.
247\. PW-129 went on to depose that he met Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava in the
office of Superintendent Engineer, PWD at Darbhanga on 22.9.1975. At that
time, he obtained his specimen writing and signatures on 15 sheets Ex.PW-1/W-1
to PW-1/W-15 and he gave his specimen writing and signatures voluntarily in
the presence of Sh. R.B.P. Yadav, P.A. to Superintendent Engineer. Sh. Yadav
has also signed on these documents at point 'X' in his presence. PW-1 has also
confirmed at page no.36 of his statement that he has given his specimen
writings and signatures Ex.PW-1/W-1 to Ex.PW1/W-15 (S-45 to S-59) voluntarily.
He testified that documents Ex.PW-1/T, Ex.PW-1/U and Ex.PW-1/V bear his
handwritings, which he had written during his posting in the office of
Superintendant Engineer, Darbhanga. He admitted writings on these three
documents, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 331 which are Mark A-73 to A-77. PW-43 Sh. B. Lal,
Government Examiner of Questioned Documents, Government of India, Shimla
examined these specimen handwriting and signatures of PW-1 Madan Mohan
Srivastava S-45 to S-59 (Ex.PW-1/W-1 to PW-1/W-15) and admitted writing Mark
A-73 to A-77 on Ex.PW-1/T to Ex.PW-1/V and compared with questioned writing
Ex.PW-1/P (Q-8) in the sheet of the register of Hotel Republic Ex.PW-1/5 and
on the Voucher Ex.PW-1/R (Q-9). (Documents Ex.PW-1/T to Ex.PW-1/V, having
admitted writing Mark A-73 to Mark A-77 of PW-1 are available in the Folder
R-4). He (PW-43) deposed (at page no. 931 and 932 of his statement) that the
person (Madan Mohan Srivastava), who wrote both these writings S-45 to S-59
and A-73 to A-77 also wrote the writing Mark Q-8 (an entry in the register of
Visitors of Hotel Republic Ex.PW-1/Q reading as S.K. Gupta and PW-1/P, marked
Q-8 in different column, signatures reading as S.K. Gupta on the Cash Voucher
of Hotel Republic, Patna (Q-9) and marked as Ex.PW-1/R). He further deposed
that both these writings agreed in general and individual writing habits, such

for the detailed reasons given in his deposition and in his opinion
Ex.PW-43/P-1 to P-20. He also deposed that questioned CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 332
writings are free in execution, there is no question of imitation in their
production, and the above similarity when collectively considered proved the
common authorship. This further corroborates the statement of PW-1 that he
stayed in Hotel Republic under assumed name of 'S.K. Gupta' to watch the
movement of Abdul Gaffoor on the direction of accused Santoshanand.
248\. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that PW-1 should have been taken to
Hotel Republic for his test identification parade from the hotel employees to
confirm and prove whether he (PW-1) stayed there as 'Shankar Kumar Gupta' on
29.12.1973. Nevertheless, there is no force in the contention of Ld. Defence
Counsel when the writing on the record of Hotel Republic has not only been
admitted by PW-1 in his own handwriting and admitted his signatures. Further,
PW-126A has identified the signatures of PW-1 as S.K. Gupta on the Register
Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q and on the Voucher Ex.PW-1/R. Further, PW-43 Sh. B.
Lal, GEQD has also proved by his expert opinion that that the person (Madan
Mohan Srivastava), who wrote both these specimen writings S-45 to S-59 and
admitted writing A-73 to A-77, also wrote the questioned writing Mark Q-8 on
the Visitors Register Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q and Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R
(Q-9). Therefore, there was no occasion for the prosecution to get conducted
TIP of PW-1 from the employees of Hotel Republic, Patna namely PW-16, PW-17,
PW-147, Sh. H.K. Singha and Mr. Sher Khil and others. For the same reason,
there was no necessity for prosecution to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 333 verify the Karol
Bagh address, given by PW-1 to the Hotel Staff of Hotel Republic.
249\. Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate argued that Bill Book
(containing Bill Ex.PW-17/A) is not maintained in chronologically and appeared
to be fabricated one. The argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel on the face of
it look to be attractive but it has no force, when bill book is perused very
minutely. This bill book containing Bill Ex.PW-17/A is a bound volume having
copies of bills from serial no.8001 to 8100. These copies of the bills in the
said bill book reflect that the entries in the bill book are made by the date
of arrival of the visitor in the Hotel and bill is issued on the date of
departure. The relevant bill no.8025 Ex.PW-17/A shows that Shankar Kumar Gupta
arrived at the Hotel on 29.12.1973 at 8.35 PM. He stayed there in Room No.41.
His name is mentioned at point Ex.PW- 17/A-1 and in body of the bill both
dates of arrival as 29.12.1973 and departure as 30.12.1973 are mentioned. On
the left top of the bill, it is mentioned that the visitor paid Rs.50/- in
advance and his bill was for Rs.40.28. This bill was issued on 30.12.1973. The
next bill no. 8026 was issued on 3.1.1974 and in the body of the bill the
dates of arrival and departure of the visitor are mentioned as 30.12.1973 and
03.1.1974 respectively. The next three bills referred by Ld. Defence Counsel
in her arguments are 8027, 8028 and 8029, which were issued on 31.12.1973. But
a perusal of the bills shows that date of arrival of visitors in all these
three bills are 30.12.1973 and dates of departure CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 334 are
31.12.1973 and that is why bills were issued on date of departure i.e.
31.12.1973. Thereafter, the bill no. 8030 is dated 01.1.1973 showing the date
of arrival of the visitor on 30.12.1973 and departure on 1.1.1974. There is a
clerical error in issuing this bill dated 1.1.1973 instead of 1.1.1974 as it a
matter of common parlance that whenever 1st January or 2 nd January comes the
people are habitual in writing the previous year or continue to write the
previous year in the first week of January of the next year. For this reason,
this error has crept in bill no. 8030 otherwise in the body of the bill, it is
clearly reflected that the visitor has arrived in the Hotel on 30.12.1973 and
he made his departure on 1.1.1974. Then next bill is No.8031 issued on
2.1.1974 and body of the bill shows the date of arrival of the visitor as
30.12.1973 and of departure on 2.1.1974. Similarly, the bills 8032 and 8033
were issued on 31.12.1973 as the date of arrival and departure of the visitors
is same i.e. 31.12.1973. Next bill is 8034, it was issued on 3.1.1974, and in
the body of the bill, the date of arrival of the visitor is 31.12.1973 and of
departure is 3.1.1974. Then next bill no. 8035 was issued on 1.1.1974 and the
body of the bill, date of arrival and departure of the visitor is the same
i.e. 1.1.1974. The entire bill book shows that the entries in the Bills are
entered into by the hotel staff partly as soon as on the arrival of the
visitor. The bill is issued to the visitor on his departure. The date of
departure is mentioned at the top of the bill whereas date of arrival and
departure are mentioned in the body of each bill. So, all the bills of Hotel
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 335 Republic contained in Bill Book having Bill No. 8001
to 8100 have been issued in due course of its business on the date of
departure of the visitor's.
250\. Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Gulati then argued that the Cash Voucher
Ex.PW-1/R (Q-9) and Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q (Q-8) do not
bear the signatures of PW-1 as 'S. K. Gupta'. PW-1 has already admitted the
signatures in his own handwriting. Further, as discussed hereinbefore, this
has been corroborated by PW- 126A, who has also identified these signatures on
Cash Vouchers Ex.PW-1/R and Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q in the
handwriting of PW-1. Apart from this, specimen writing and signatures of PW-1
and his admitted writing was compared by GEQD PW-43, who had given his expert
opinion that after comparing the writing Q-8 and Q-9 with specimen and
admitted handwritings of PW- 1, he came to the conclusion that writer of these
writings is same i.e. PW-1. Thus, there is no force in the submission of Ld.
Defence Counsel. It is further argued that on behalf of accused persons that
PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha did not seize the cash voucher immediately on his
visit on 03.05.1975 when he seized the Bill Book and sheet of Visitor's
Register and that after about four months, on 19.09.1975, PW-129 Sh. Narender
Nath Singh seized the Voucher Ex.PW-1/R. This voucher is in respect of refund
of excess amount of Rs. 9.72 to the visitor Sh. S.K. Gupta vide bill no.8025.
It is already mentioned hereinbefore that on Bill Ex.PW-17/A, it is mentioned
that visitor CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 336 'Shankar Kumar Gupta' had paid Rs.50/- in
advance. The bill was for Rs.40.28 and vide this cash voucher dated 30.12.1973
Ex.PW-1/R, a sum of Rs.9.72 was refunded to the visitor namely Sh. S.K. Gupta,
who is none as but PW-1.
251\. Ld. Defence Counsel vehemently argued that the entire Visitor's Register
of Hotel Republic has not been filed and the prosecution has only filed a
loose sheet of the Visitor's Register. The left side part of the loose sheet
is Ex.PW-1/P and the right side part of the sheet Ex.PW-1/Q. She submits that
this loose sheet of the Visitor's Register cannot be read into evidence and in
support of her submissions, she has referred Section 34 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872, which reads as under: -
> "34 (Entries in books of account, including those maintained in an
> electronic form) when relevant: (Entries in books of account, including
> those maintained in an electronic form), regularly kept in the course of
> business, are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court
> has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence
> to charge any person with liability."
252\. The Ld. Defence Counsel has relied upon Para No. 16, 17 & 20 of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Central Bureau CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 337
of Investigation vs. V.C. Shukla, 1998 (3) SCC 410, wherein Section 34 of
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 came up for interpretation and the cited Para of the
judgment are as under: -
> "16. From a plain reading of the Section it is manifest that to make an
> entry relevant there under it must be shown that it has been made in a book,
> that book is a book of account and that book of account has been regularly
> kept in the course of business. From the above Section, it is also manifest
> that even if the above requirements are fulfilled and the entry becomes
> admissible as relevant evidence, still, the statement made therein shall not
> alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability. It is thus
> seen that while the first part of the section speaks of the relevancy of the
> entry as evidence, the second part speaks, in a negative way, of its
> evidentiary value for charging a person with a liability. It will,
> therefore, be necessary for us to first ascertain whether the entries in the
> documents, with which we are concerned, fulfill the requirements of the
> above section so as to be admissible in evidence and if this question is
> answered in the affirmative then only its probative value need be assessed.

> ...................................I think the term "book"
in Section 34 aforesaid may properly be taken to signify, ordinarily, a
collection of sheets of paper bound together with the intention that such
binding shall be permanent and the papers used CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 339 collectively
in one volume. It is easier however to say which is not a book for the
purposes of Section 34, and I have no hesitation in holding that unbound
sheets of paper in whatever quantity, though filled up with one continuous
account, are not a book of account within the purview of Section 34."
We must observe that the aforesaid approach is in accord with good reasoning
and we are in full agreement with it. Applying the above tests it must be held
that the two spiral note books (MR 68/91 and MR 71/91) and the two spiral pads
(MR 69/91 and MR 70/91) are "books" within the meaning of Section 34, but not
the loose sheets of papers contained in the two files (MR 72/91 and 73/91).
20\. The word 'account' has been defined in Words and Phrases, Permanent
Edition, Volume IA at pages 336 to 338 to mean (i) a claim or demand by one
person against another creating a debtor-
creditor relation; (ii) a formal statement in detail of transactions between
two parties arising out of contracts or some fiduciary relation. At page 343
of the same book the word has also been defined to mean the preparation of
record or statement of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 340 transactions or the like; a
statement and explanation of one's administration or conduct in money affairs;
a statement or record of financial transactions, a reckoning or computation; a
registry of pecuniary transactions or a reckoning of money transactions; a
written or printed statement of business dealing or debts and credits; or a
certain class of them. It is thus seen that while the former definitions give
the word 'account' a restrictive meaning the latter give it a comprehensive
meaning. Similarly is the above word defined, both restrictively and
expansively, in Black's Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition) to mean 'a detailed
statement of the mutual demands in the nature of debit and credit between the
parties arising out of contracts or some fiduciary relation. A statement in
writing, of debits and credits, or of receipts and payments; a list of items
of debits and credits, with their respective dates. A statement of pecuniary
transactions; a record or course of business dealings between parties; a list
of statement of monetary transactions, such as payments, losses, sales,
debits, credits, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc., in most cases
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 341 showing a balance or result of comparison between
items of an opposite nature."
253\. Elaborating on section 34 of Evidence Act, she has also relied upon Para
24 & 25 of another judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ishwar Dass Jain vs.
Sohan Lal, 2000 (1) SCC 434 which reads as under:-
> "24. In the recent judgment of this Court in Central Bureau of Investigation
> v. V.C. Shukla, 1998(3) SCC 410, it has been laid down that for purposes of
> Section 34, 'Book' ordinarily means a collection of sheets of paper or other
> material, blank, written or printed, fastened or bound together so as to
> form a material whole. Loose sheets of papers or scraps of paper cannot be
> termed as 'book' for they can be easily detached and replaced. It has also
> been held that the rationale behind admissibility of parties' books of
> account as evidence is that the regularity of habit, the difficulty of
> falsification and the fair certainty of ultimate detection give them in a
> sufficient degree, a probability of trustworthiness." When that is the legal
> position, extracts of alleged account books, in our view, were wrongly
> treated as admissible by the courts below though the CBI Vs. Santoshanand
> etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 342
> original books were not produced for comparison nor their non-production was
> explained nor the person who had prepared the extracts was examined.
> 25\. Therefore, the private extracts of alleged account books like Exs.D2 to
> D5 are not admissible. The principal evidence relating to the alleged
> payment of rent disappears and the foundation for the alternative plea of
> tenancy crumbles. This is one reason why the finding relating to tenancy is
> vitiated being based on inadmissible evidence."
254\. There is no dispute about the proposition of law settled by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in V.C. Shukla's case (supra) and Ishwar Dass Jain's case
(supra). However, these judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court are not applicable
as the "Visitors Register" of a Hotel is not a "Book of Accounts" within the
meaning of Section 34 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. This has been so held
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manish Dixit vs. State of Rajasthan 2001 (1)
SCC 596 and the relevant Para reads as under:
> "15. True Section 34 contains the rider that "such statement shall not alone
> be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability." In the first
> place the provision deals only with "books of accounts".
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 343 It primarily pertains to pecuniary transactions.
> The expression "books of accounts" means book in which merchants, traders or
> businessmen generally keep their accounts i.e. statements of debits and
> credits or receipts and payments. A register kept at the counter of hotel
> need not contain any statement of account. So, until it is shown that such
> register also pertained to the pecuniary transactions involving the
> customers of the hotel the same cannot be treated as a book of accounts. In
> the second place, even if it is assumed that a register kept in a hotel can
> be treated as a book of accounts, the entry therein cannot become the sole
> premise to charge a person with liability. The entry found in the register
> kept at Sanjay Hotel can only show a circumstance that A.2 Manish Dixit has
> written in it the name 'Rakesh (Ramesh ?) Chander Sharma' as the person who
> occupied particular room in the hotel on 24.2.1994. Why did A.2 write such a

> December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 344 inference that A.2 (Manish
> Dixit) had some reasons to conceal his identity to the hotel people and
> hence he wrote a pseudonymous name in the register."
255\. Moreover, it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Singh
alias Photti's case (supra), R.L. Vaid's case (supra), Parasa Raja Manikyala
Rao's case (supra) and by our Hon'ble High Court in Sukhvinder Singh Sandhu's
case (supra) that unless and until the facts and circumstances in a cited case
are in pari materia in all respect with the facts and circumstances of the
case in hand, it will not be proper to cite an earlier case as a precedent to
arrive at a definite conclusion.
256\. Apart from it, the particulars of this sheet of Visitor's Register of
Hotel Republic Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q bearing particulars of PW-1 and his
signatures and handwriting at point Q8 dated 29.12.1973 tally with the
particulars mentioned on the Bill Ex.PW- 17/A. This sheet of Visitor's
Register Ex.PW-1/P and PW-1/Q dated 29th December 1973 is in respect of visit
of Sh. Shankar Kumar Gupta, Indian, Occupation-Business, R/o S-8/19, SWA,
Karol Bagh, Delhi-5. It is mentioned that he arrived from Allahabad and was to
go back to Allahabad. He was allotted room No. 41 in the Hotel. The Bill
number is also mentioned as 8025 in the last column. He has signed as S.K.
Gupta. All these particulars are Q-8, which have been owned CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 345 by PW-1 in his own handwriting. PW-126A has also identified this
handwriting Q-8 in the hand of PW-1. PW-43 has also opined that this
handwriting and signatures Q-8 do tally with the specimen and admitted
handwriting and signatures of PW-1. The relevant particulars of the Visitor's
Register in respect of visit of Sh. S.K. Gupta also match with the
corresponding entries in the relevant Bill No. 8025 Ex.PW-17/A. The entry in
this Bill Ex.PW-17/A was made in respect of visitor Shankar Kumar Gupta on
29.12.1973 as time of arrival is also reflected as 8.35 PM. The date of
departure is mentioned as 30.12.1973 with checkout time as 10.30 AM. On the
left top corner, it is mentioned that he has paid advance Rs.50/- vide Receipt
No. 8521. The total expenses of two days stay in the Hotel are mentioned as
Rs.40.28. It is also reflected from the Bill Ex.PW-17/A that visitor Mr.
Shankar Kumar Gupta was allotted Room No. 41. Mentioning of room No. 41 and
Bill No. 8025 in the folio of Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q draws
authentication from the Bill Ex.PW-17/A contained in the Bill Book. Apart from
this authentication, further corroboration is found with Ex.PW-1/R, which is a
Cash Voucher dated 30.12.1973 by which balance amount of Rs.9.72 was refunded
to the visitor mentioned in the Bill No. 8025. The visitor has signed as S.K.
Gupta with date 30/12/73 and his signatures and date are Q-9. I have already
discussed these signatures and dates Q-9 are in the handwriting of PW-1. The
writing and signatures of this entry by Mr. Shankar Kumar Gupta have been CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 346 proved to be in the handwriting of PW-1 by PW-126A
Maheshwar Parsad. This is further corroborated by the statement of GEQD PW- 43
Sh. B. Lal, who compared these disputed signatures of Sh. Shankar Kumar Gupta
with the admitted and specimen handwriting and signatures and came to the
opinion that these are in the handwriting of the same writer i.e. PW-1.
(Cash Voucher dated 30.12.1973 Ex.PW-1/R is available in Folder R-4)
257\. Cleverly, in the cross-examination of PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha, it was
put to him that this is the last entry of 29.12.1973 to mislead the court as
if it was last entry on the sheet of the Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P and
Ex.PW-1/Q. A perusal of this folio Ex.PW- 1/P and Ex.PW-1/Q shows that this
entry is in the middle of the folio of the Visitor's Register of Hotel
Republic and even after this entry, there are seven more entries of
30.12.1973, five entries of 01.1.1974, three entries of 02.1.1974 and two
entries of 03.1.1974. Therefore, the suggestion made to the witness and
argument ensued thereon by Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate is highly irrelevant and
connotes nothing to disbelieve this documentary evidence. The document does
not go to support the contention of the defence that this entry is
interpolated or added in the Register to fabricate the folio of the Visitor's
Register.
27) Further tracking the movements of CM.
258\. PW-1 further deposed that he was told that Abdul Gaffoor did not come to
the Hotel Republic, and Santoshanand ascertained from CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 347
somewhere that Abdul Gaffoor used to come to the house of a Muslim family near
Palace Hotel, Opposite Gandhi Maidan Patna. Then, Santoshanand gave him a
loaded revolver. He also gave one each country made revolvers to Arteshanand
and Sudevanand, and so from 30.12.1973 to 4.1.1974, he himself, Arteshanand
and Sudevanand kept a watch from 8.00 PM to 12 O' Clock at night on a rickshaw
near Palace Hotel. Santoshanand used to supervise this action by remaining
present near about them all through. He testified that they could not see
Abdul Gaffoor coming to that family.
259\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 replied on this point that he did not
know the name of the Head of Muslim family. The family was known as Khan
Family. In his further cross-examination, PW-1 testified that the house of a
Muslim woman, where Abdul Gaffoor was expected to come, was situated in a
thickly populated locality. There was a Palace Hotel near that house. On the
back of that Hotel, there was a cinema. When he (PW-1) used to follow Abdul
Gaffoor for this purpose, it was winter season and he would wrap a chaddar and
put on pajama. He would keep the revolver in his hand hidden inside the
chaddar. They used to keep sitting on a rickshaw while Santoshanand used to
move about. The rickshaw had been hired from nearby, where so many rickshaws
remained parked. There was no bus Adda (bus stand) nearby. He could not say if
there was any local bus stop nearby. He did not see any police officer moving
thereabout on that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 348 place where they had positioned
themselves. He had no arm licence with him.
260\. The testimony of PW-1 suggests that the then Chief Minister of Bihar
used to stay at Hotel Republic, Patna and also used to visit the house of a
Muslim family and the accused having gathered knowledge about the movement of
the then Chief Minister. The cross- examination did not demolish the movements
and the described occasional visits of the then Chief Minister Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor. Certain trivial questions were only put to PW-1 in his cross-
examination asking him the minute's details as regards the mode of transport
chosen by them in chasing their target and the details regarding location of
the house, the name of the Head of that Muslim family. These aspects of the
cross-examination instead of discrediting the witness, rather fortifies the
chasing by PW-1 and co-conspirators. Therefore, the cross-examination has no
relevance to disbelieve the movements of PW-1. Thus, the arguments advanced by
Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate that no Rikshaw wala who ply rickshaw near Palace
Hotel, Patna, has been examined by the prosecution goes to oblivion.
261\. PW-67 Sh. Ali Waris Khan deposed that he owned a house in Patna City,
where he has been residing with his family since 1948. He deposed that he has
seen Gandhi Maidan (ground), Patna and there is Palace Hotel towards South of
Gandhi Maidan and his house was just adjacent and South of the Hotel Palace.
It was a blind lane, which was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 349 only way to lead to his
house. He knew Abdul Gaffoor, who had been former Chief Minister of Bihar
since 1952. They used to meet very often, and after 1962, Abdul Gaffoor often
used to visit his house to meet him and visited his house during the year
1973-74. In the year 1974, the visits of Abdul Gaffoor to his house were rare
though in the year 1973 he used to visit his house.
262\. In his cross-examination, PW-67 answered that Abdul Gaffoor used to
visit his place only for gossiping, in which he was interested. Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor never told him that Anand Margies were after his life. He had no
knowledge whether security men in plain clothes used to travel with Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor, Chief Minister, when he came to him. He did not know whether
information about visit of Abdul Gaffoor, Chief Minister used to be given to
the Police or not. Local police never informed him to the effect that they had
received message about intending visit of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor to his house. Sh.
Abdul Gaffoor was Chief Minister of Bihar for two and half years and he
remembered that he was Chief Minister in the year 1973 and 1974. He did not
remember whether Abdul Gaffoor used to visit his house twice in a week or some
time thrice in a week. (When the witness was confronted with his previous
statement under Section 161 Cr. PC, there is a mention of frequent visits and
not about twice or thrice a week).
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 350
263\. The cross-examination of this witness PW-67, when perused carefully,
only confirms the fact that the then Chief Minister used to visit the house of
this witness frequently, as both were good friends. This information gathered
by Santoshanand prompted him to propel PW-1, Sudevanand and Arteshanand to
follow and exploit a chance to eliminate the target. There is no force in the
arguments of the Ld. Defence Counsel that PW-67 Ali Waris Khan in not stating
about any of the threats to the life of Abdul Gaffoor at the hands of Anand
Margies would render the prosecution case unbelievable. There is also no force
in the arguments that Abdul Gaffoor has visited his house rarely in the year
1973 and that is why she argues that the story of the prosecution is woven to
fix the accused. Rather the testimony of PW- 67 corroborates the statement of
PW-1 to the effect that accused no.1 Santoshanand having told him that Abdul
Gaffoor used to come to the house of Muslim family near Palace Hotel, Opposite
Gandhi Maidan, Patna.

                        Vinayanand.
264\. PW-1 averred on oath that in the Morning of 05.1.1974, Vinayanand
reached there with hand grenade brought from Bangaon. It was shown to him
(PW-1), Arteshanand and Sudevanand at Gulzar Bagh house (Patna). After two or
three hours, Santoshanand also reached there and Santoshanand suggested that
they should leave the Abdul Gaffoor for the time being and follow Madhavanand
as he was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 351 to be produced before the District Magistrate,
Patna on 07.1.1974. He also deposed that one Ram Swarath Singh, an Anand
Margi, was called through him there, as he was familiar with the locality
where Madhavanand was to be brought. It was decided that they would go in
groups of two or three in order to survey the surroundings in which the
District Magistrate's court was situated. On 06.1.1974, he himself along with
Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand and Ram Swarath Singh went
to Collectorate in groups of two and three. After survey of the surroundings,
they came back to their house at Gulzar Bagh. It was then decided that as soon
as Madhavanand would be brought in the Collectorate, Vinayanand would throw
hand grenade on Madhavanand, which he had brought from Bangaon. It was also
decided that he (PW-1) would remain there with a revolver with instructions
that after throwing the hand grenade, he (PW-1) would escort him (Vinayanand)
to a place near Police Line where on the road a person on the motorcycle would
be waiting for them and they would be then driven off on that motorcycle. PW-1
further testified that finally on his objection, it was agreed that Vinayanand
would alone carry the revolver and a hand grenade and would act there as
considered best by him in the situation. Vinayanand agreed to this suggestion.
Santoshanand asked him (PW-1) to go to Chautham. On 06.1.1974, during night he
left for Chautham and was asked to stay there with Gopalji (A-7) at his house
and wait for others i.e. Santoshanand (A-1) and others until 15.1.1974 by
which date they CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 352 would reach there. He (PW-1) gave his
ammunitions and revolver to A-1 before leaving for Chautham. He (PW-1) reached
there (at Chautham) in the Morning of 7th January (1974) by bus. A-7 was not
present at his house at that time. He (PW-1) stayed at Gopalji's house. There
he heard the radio news at 7.30 PM that an attempt to kill Madhavanand
remained unsuccessful and at about 9-10 AM, on 8th January (1974) A-7 came
there with a newspaper, which contained the details of Madhavanand's life. A-7
suggested him that he should shift to his farmhouse at Tilihar on the other
side of the Kosi River. He told A-7 that A-1 and others would be coming from
Patna by 15th January (1974) whereon A-7 advised him to wait for them at
Tilihar. Accordingly, he went to Tilihar where he remained until 15th January
(1974).
265\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 answered that he did not prepare any
sketch/map after surveying the route along with which Madhavanand had to come
in the Collectorate. PW-1 has further replied in his cross-examination that he
did not state in his 164 statement that on 06.01.1974, he was asked to stay
there with Gopalji at his house until 15.01.1974 at Chautham. He did not state
in his 164 statement that he gave his ammunition and revolver to Santoshanand
before leaving for Chautham. He stated that he had only said that all his
belongings were handed over to Santoshanand. (When he was confronted with his
previous statement Ex.PW-1/X, where later part, it was not found recorded
therein). He did not state in his 164 statement CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 353 that
at Chautham, he told A-7 that A-1 and others would be reaching there by 15th
January and A-7 advised him to wait for them at Tilihar or that he went to
Tilihar and remained there till 15th January.
266\. The further testimony of PW-1 has been perused. The course of cross-
examination by the accused, does not repel the arrival of Vinayanand on
05.01.1974 with a grenade from Bangaon, showing of hand grenade PW-1,
Arteshanand and A-2 at Gulzar Bagh house (Patna) or direction by A-1 to leave
Abdul Gaffoor and concentrate on Madhavanand, who was to be produced in
Collectorate, Patna on 07.01.1974 or that the decision that Vinayanand shall
attack Madhavanand with the said hand grenade. The cross-examination does not
shatter that PW-1 left for Chautham on 06.01.1974 and reached there on
07.01.1974 in the Morning. They have also not derided that on his reaching at
Chautham, A-7 was not found in his house or of his stay in the house of
Gopalji's or coming of A-7 on 8th January (1974) with a newspaper containing
the details of attack Madhavanand's life. They have also not discredited that
Gopalji had no house at Chautham or that PW-1 did not come there on
07.01.1974. They have also not challenged his testimony that Gopalji suggested
to PW-1 to shift to his farmhouse at Tilihar. The defence has also not
discredited PW-1 having told Gopalji that A-1 and others would be coming from
Patna by 15th January (1974) or that Gopalji advised him to wait for them at
Tilihar or that he went to Tilihar, where he remained until 15th January
(1974). Merely because PW-1 did not state in his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 354
statement under Section 164 Cr. PC about A-1 asking him to go to Chautham or
PW-1 handed over arms and ammunitions to A-1 are only matter of minute
details, which were even otherwise not required to be stated. In these
circumstances, the further deposition of PW-1 is found worth credible and
acceptance.
29) Attempt to kill Madhavanand
267\. At the cost of repetition, it is worth mentioning that on reaching of
Vinayanand at Gulzar Bagh House on 05.01.1974, with a hand grenade from
Bangaon, ultimately it was decided that Vinayanand would alone carry the
revolver and hand grenade and attack Madhavanand as soon as he would be
brought in the Collectorate, Patna. PW-1, then, left for Chautham on
06.01.1974. Pursuant to the criminal conspiracy hatched at the terrace of the
house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan in October 1973, an attempt was made on the
life of Madhavanand on 07.01.1974. Let us examine the relevant evidence.
268\. PW-8 Ct. Jai Kishan Singh, PS Kotwali, Patna deposed that on 7.1.1974,
he was posted at Sadar Treasury, Patna as Guard on duty. On that day, at about
10.30 AM, he was sitting on the Northern side of the Guard Room of the
Treasury and basking in the Sun. HC Ram Aasrey Singh, HC Rajender Singh and
Ct. Gorakhnath were also there with him. They had finished their duty by that
time. At that time, one jeep BRV-1400 came from the Western side and was
parked on the Eastern side of the Guard Room. Severn or eight persons
including CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 355 one Madhavanand Avadhoot, whose name he came to
know later on, came there. He saw Madhavanand accompanied by escort party
proceeding towards the North for urination. After Madhavanand returned, he sat
on the front seat of the jeep while the members of the escort party stood on
side of the park. After a short while, he noticed four persons reaching there
from Western side and stood near the park at a distance of 20 paces away from
that jeep on the road. One of those four persons was in saffron clothes while
others were in plain clothes. Out of whom, one of them was wrapping himself
with a saffron chaddar. That person in saffron chaddar was having one revolver
in his hand. Immediately that person with a saffron chaddar threw a hand
grenade with his right hand towards the jeep and that grenade fell at a
distance about 2-2½ yards from the jeep but it did not explode. Immediately
they all and some members of the escort party ran towards that man to secure
him. However, that man first ran towards West and after covering some distance
ran towards North and he again ran towards West. They continued to follow him
and he was running along with the bank of Ganga. At some distance from
Dhobighat that person fired three shots towards them but fortunately none of
them was hit as they had taken their positions. Since the road/pagdandi
(footpath), on which that person was running, was blocked after Magad Mahila
College Hostel, that man jumped in the River. He (PW-8) and Ct. Gorakhnath
also jumped in the River followed by Kailash (PW-10), driver of that jeep.
Kailash Driver CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 356 (PW-10), however, stopped at some distance
whereas they continued to follow that man. After swimming a distance of about
100 yards, they secured that man in the River and that man sustained some
injuries on being secured. He was brought to shore and by that time police
officials and district officials assembled there. That person was feigning
unconsciousness. They took that person to the Police Information Room after
bodily lifting him. PW-8 deposed that he would be in a position to identify
that man, if his photograph was shown to him. He identified the photograph
Ex.P-4 of the person, who was secured in the River Ganga on that day. The
other three associates of that person managed to escape from the place from
where the hand grenade was thrown. He deposed that while basking in the Sun,
he was wearing wooden sleepers and when he started chasing that person, he
left those wooden sleepers at some distance from the grenade.
269\. In his cross-examination, PW-8 answered that in those days, the office
of Collector used to start at 10.30 AM. That Jeep was parked hardly at a
distance of about 50 yards, may be less than that, from the office of the
Collector. The public starts reaching the Collector Office at about 10.00 AM.
He deposed that he saw those four persons, when one of them threw the grenade.
Earlier also, he had noticed them when they stood there and were gazing at the
jeep. Since one of those persons threw the grenade immediately after they
assembled there, there was no occasion for them to ask them to move away from
the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 357 place. He along with others ran after that person,
who had thrown the grenade. He was not aware whether any person chased the
remaining three persons. The guard party, which was surrounding the jeep at
that time, was armed with the rifles. Two of those guards ran after the
person, who threw the grenade, while the rest remained on guard on
Madhavanand. None of those guards fired any shot at that time. When that
person, who threw the grenade, fired three shots towards them, none of the
guard returned the fire as they were in between. The guards did not fire any
shot in the air. He was not aware whether police recovered any empty
cartridges from that place subsequently. In his presence, no bullet was
recovered. The roof of that jeep was of tarpaulin. The back portion of that
jeep and two sides of the jeep were uncovered. He answered that saffron
chaddar of that man fell on the path, while he was running. He did not lift
it. Even subsequently, he did not notice that Chaddar in possession of any
police officials. The Station House Officer of Police Station Kotwali Patna
came there after some time. He stated in his statement under Section 161 of
Cr. PC that the person, who was ultimately arrested, was wearing a saffron
chaddar. (When he was confronted with his previous statement, the word
"saffron" was not found written). He replied that no efforts were made to pick
up the revolver from the river because of deep water. He has denied the
suggestion that the said person was unarmed or that he did not fire any shot
from any revolver. In his further cross- examination, it is found that he was
promoted as Constable on that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 358 very day, when they arrested
that person i.e. on 07.1.1974. He also got commendation certificate and hike
in the pay. He denied the suggestion for such commendation he has deposed
falsely at the instance of CBI. He answered that the man was feigning
unconsciousness and neither he nor police officers asked his name. In fact,
said person was not speaking anything and nothing was inquired from him for
that reason. (When confronted with his previous statement, it was found
recorded "on asking he did not tell anything"). He replied that when they
returned after having arrested that person, Madhavanand had already been
removed inside the office of District Magistrate and in fact, he did not see
Madhavanand thereafter on that day. He further informed in his previous
statement that the arrested person was removed to the Police Information Room.
(When confronted with his previous statement, the word "lift" is not mentioned
and it is mentioned that he was taken there by catching hold of him). In his
previous statement, he had mentioned having seen four persons across the jeep
before throwing of the grenade. He stated that apart from saffron chaddar,
that person was in plain clothes and only that person out of four was wrapping
a saffron chaddar. He was not sporting any beard. (When confronted with his
previous statement, it was found mentioned that the beard of that person was
not grown). He was a cleanly shaved except for moustaches. He did not
recollect whether in his previous statement, he mentioned the name of Ram
Aasrey (P.O.) and Rajender Singh as the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 359 persons, who were
sitting with him at that time. (When confronted with his previous statement,
only designations instead of their names are found mentioned). He testified
that the grenade thrown, which did not explode immediately, was later on while
defusing it by the Military persons at about 06.00 or 06.30 PM, an explosion
occurred, causing a lot of damage to the Collectorate building.
270\. The perusal of the cross-examination of PW-8 makes it clear that the
defence could not be successful in whittling down the veracity of this witness
in describing the incident that had occurred on 07.01.1974. In fact, the
cross-examination rather fortified the presence of PW-8, his colleague-police
officials, the presence of the jeep and Madhavanand being brought there by the
escort party and PW-8 having noticed four unknown person amongst whom one
person having saffron chaddar etc. Further, his cross-examination has not
demolished the said person taking out a hand grenade from the chaddar, which
was thrown at Madhavanand and the escort party. It has further not demolished
remaining three persons running away from the scene, the PW-8 along with PW-10
chasing the culprit, who flung the grenade and culminating into his arrest
from the river Ganga, into which he jumped and PW-8 identifying the photograph
Ex.P-4. Only certain improvements have been extracted in the cross-
examination. One of these improvements is the chaddar having not been
described with its colour saffron. What is pointed by the defence is that PW-8
being silent about his non-observing the other three CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 360
associates of the culprit after the incident. The further improvement is that
the non-observance by the PW-8 to speak with regard to the empty cartridges
arising out of the three shots fired by the said person, who flung the grenade
and with regard to the fate of the chaddar (a piece of lengthy cloth to cover
one's body). These improvements are minor in nature and should be evaluated in
the grim circumstances where an unexpected and sudden event of serious nature
like the flinging of grenade happens; that too against a person brought by the
police. Under such situation, the police officials would naturally run to
catch hold of the culprit rather than to observe the minute circumstances like
the colour and fate of the covering cloth or the fate of empty cartridges.
When sighted from the order of human behavior and especially by a person
belonging to the police department, the improvements pointed out by the
defence are not to be winked at and no serious attention can be given to such
minor improvements especially even the major events are not shaken in the
cross- examination. This witness is highly trustworthy. It is also natural
that a person acting with such an alacrity and braveness in trying to nab a
dangerous person is rewarded with the promotion, which the defence points out
having been given the same day. In fact, such a commendation further proves
the incident rather than to demolish it and enhances the morale of police
officials.
271\. PW-9 Sh. Chandi Mishra Hawaldar testified that on 06.1.1974 while he was
posted at Civil Line, Gaya as Naik, he received an order CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 361
at 8.30 PM to escort Madhavanand to Patna from Gayaji, as he was to be
produced before the Collector on 07.1.1974. Four constables and one Sh. Ram
Prasad Dubey, Zamaadar, were with him in escorting the said person. They had a
government vehicle with a driver Kailash Singh (PW-10). On 07.1.1974, they
took Madhavanand from Central Jail, Gayaji and brought him in the jeep to the
office of the Collector, Patna at about 10.30 AM. He deposed that they had
taken Madhavanand from Gayaji via Kedar Sarai, Islampur and Fatuha and at all
these three places, they noticed one red colour motorcycle and two jeeps
either following their jeep and running at a distance from them. In those
vehicles, some persons were wearing saffron clothes, while the others were in
plain clothes. He further deposed that on reaching the Collectorate, Patna,
they parked the jeep near Treasury, where Madhavanand expressed his desire to
urinate. They took him to a drain nearby and wherefrom after urination,
Madhavanand was brought back and seated on the front seat of the jeep. At that
time, he noticed four persons standing on the Western side at a distance of
20- 25 yards away from their jeep. One of them was cleanly shaven without
beard and some of them were wearing saffron clothes. The man without beard was
in plain clothes and wrapping himself with a saffron chaddar. In his left
hand, he was holding a revolver. That person immediately threw a grenade with
his right hand towards the jeep, which fell at a distance about 2 yards from
that jeep. Thereafter, that person ran towards Western side and his other
companions ran CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 362 here and there. The grenade did not
explode. Sh. Jai Kishan (PW-8) and Gorakhnath Singh, who were sitting near the
Treasury, ran after that person and he himself and driver of the jeep Kailash
Singh (PW-
10) ran after that person. After running some distance towards West, that
person took a turn and ran on the banks of River Ganga up to Dhobighat. Prior
to reaching Dhobighat, he fired three shots from his revolver towards them and
since they had taken the position, none of them was hurt. After reaching the
Dhobighat, that man jumped into the River. Ct. Gorakhnath Singh, Jai Kishan
Singh (PW-8) and Kailash (PW-10) also jumped into the River and chased that
man. Subsequently Gorakhnath Singh and PW-8 Jai Kishan Singh apprehended that
man after swimming a distance of about 100-125 yards and before they
apprehended him, that man threw his revolver in the River. After securing him,
Gorakhnath Singh and Jai Kishan Singh (PW-8) brought him to Dhobighat. The
said assailant received some injuries in process and he was brought to the
shore but did not speak anything. The said person was feigning unconsciousness
at that time. From there, that person was taken to Police Information Room. He
identified the person in the photograph Ex.P-4 to be the assailant of the
grenade in the incident. Meanwhile, SHO, Kotwali, Patna also reached the spot
and gave dictation to the officer and the same was read over to him and then
he signed it. His report is Ex.PW-9/A and bears his signatures at point A.

272\. In his cross-examination, PW-9 replied that on becoming suspicious about
the movement of that motorcycle and jeep, he noted the numbers thereof on a
paper. He stated that he had shown that paper on which he noted the number of
motorcycle to the police and he retained that paper with him, which he later
on lost it. He did not remember the make of that motorcycle. He could not
recollect the number of that motorcycle. However, he testified that they were
travelling at that time in Jeep No. BRB-1400. He told the description of two
persons who were riding on that motorcycle to the police. He told the police
that the said jeeps and motorcycles were sometime following them and at times
were running ahead of them. He stated to the police that some of the persons
in those vehicles were in plain clothes, and some in Anand Margi dress. He
informed the police the number of persons sitting on those vehicles. He
informed the police that at Collectorate Patna, Madhavanand wanted to urinate
and for that purpose they had taken him to nearby drain. He testified that in
the FIR, he had dictated the number of motorcycle, which was following their
jeep. (When confronted with his statement Ex.PW-9/A, the number was not found
mentioned). He replied that in the said FIR, he had also mentioned that one
motorcycle and two jeeps were sometime following their jeep and sometimes
running ahead of them. (When confronted with his statement Ex.PW-9/A, it was
not found mentioned). He had himself seen that red colour motorcycle running
behind their jeep as also running ahead of them. He had seen the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 364 photograph Ex.P-4 for the first time in the court. The said photo
was not taken in his presence. He had seen the grenade with his own eyes. He
did not notice any other thing lying near that grenade. He answered that the
man, who was secured from river Ganges on that date, was having only the
trimmed moustaches. He replied that in the FIR, he had mentioned having seen
four persons standing on the Western side at a distance of 20-25 paces from
their jeep. (When confronted with his statement Ex.PW-9/A, the words are "3/4
persons" were found mentioned). He mentioned in the FIR that the person, who
had thrown the grenade, was without beard. (When confronted with his statement
Ex.PW-9/A, it was found not so recorded. In the FIR, he further testified that
the person fired three shots at them, was wrapping a saffron colour chaddar.
(When confronted with his statement Ex.PW-9/A, the word "Saffron" was not
found mentioned). At the time of chasing that person, he was not having any
revolver, but a rifle with him. He did not aim at that person, as in between
there were three constables, who were also running after that man. He has
denied the suggestion that he had mentioned the red colour of motorcycle to
implicate Anand Margies falsely. In the FIR, he mentioned that the said person
was holding the revolver in his left hand. (When confronted with his statement
Ex.PW-9/A, the word "left" was not found mentioned). He mentioned in his
previous statement that the grenade was thrown towards the jeep. (When
confronted with his statement Ex.PW-9/A, the throwing CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 365
of grenade towards jeep was not found mentioned and it is mentioned that the
guards surrounded the jeep and grenade was thrown towards those guards). At
the time, when grenade was thrown, Madhavanand was sitting inside the jeep and
all the guards were surrounding the jeep within a maximum distance of one
pace, from that jeep. The grenade fell two yards short of that jeep and it did
not strike jeep at all. At that time, the grenade was thrown, he was facing
that person. That grenade fell near him. Jai Kishan (PW-8) was running ahead
and he was following him. While running, that person threw his chaddar on the
way. Neither of them had picked up. In the FIR, he had mentioned about
dropping of that chaddar by that person.
273\. A perusal of the cross-examination of PW-9 makes it abundantly clear
that the accused persons have again failed to demolish the testimony of this
witness in describing the incident that had taken place on 07.01.1974 at the
Collectorate, Patna. Rather, the cross-examination of PW-9 fortifies the
presence of PW-9, members of his escort party, guards at the Treasury
including PW-8, the presence of the jeep and Madhavanand being brought there
by them and PW-9 having noticed four unknown persons amongst whom one person
wearing saffron chaddar and revolver in his left hand. It is also not
demolished in his cross-examination that the said person taking out a grenade
from the chaddar, which was thrown towards jeep, in which Madhavanand was
seated in the front seat and surrounded by members of the escort party
including PW-9. It has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 366 further not demolished that
remaining three persons having running away here and there from the scene of
the crime, the PW-8, Gorakhnath along with PW-9 and PW-10 chasing the culprit,
who flung the grenade and culminating into his arrest from the river Ganga,
into which he jumped and PW-9 identifying the photograph Ex.P-4. The Ld.
Defence Counsel pointed out a few little improvements in the statement of the
witness, which are descriptive in nature. Those trivial improvements are that
in his previous statement, he mentioned that those unknown persons were 3 or
4, whereas in the court, he deposed that those were four persons, out of which
one of them had wrapped himself with a saffron chaddar. They have also pointed
out that the word "Saffron" was not found mentioned in his previous statement.
It is also pointed out that in the court the witness has stated that one out
of those four persons, was carrying a revolver in his left hand and this word
"left" was not found mentioned in his previous statement. The defence has also
pointed out that the PW-9 is silent about his non-observing the other three
associates of the culprit after the incident. The defence has also pointed out
that PW-9 has not stated as to whether three empty cartridges of the shots
fired by the culprit and his saffron chaddar were recovered or not by the
police. These improvements are not serious in nature and should be evaluated
in the grim circumstances where an unexpected event of grave and gruesome
nature like the flinging of grenade happens; that too against a person in
police custody. Under such circumstances, the police CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 367
officials would naturally run behind the culprit rather than to observe the
minute details like the colour and fate of the covering cloth or the fate of
empty cartridges. The Ld. Defence Counsel also pointed out that this witness
PW-9 could not give the registration number and other details of the vehicles,
which were following them from Gayaji to Patna. In fact, at that time, it was
never in the mind of the escort party that Madhavanand could be the target of
those persons. The incident took place at the destination of the escort party
i.e. Collectorate Patna. In the circumstances, when there was no such prior
information about impending attack on Madhavanand on the way from Gayaji to
Patna, there was no occasion for the members of the escort party including
PW-9 to note down the registration numbers and make of the vehicles, which
were following them or sometimes, they were driving ahead of their jeep. The
testimony of PW-9, who is a police official and a public servant, inspires
confidence and the defence in any manner could not demolish his testimony.
274\. PW-10 Sh. Kailash Singh, Hawaldar deposed that in January 1974, he was
posted as Driver at Police Line, Gayaji. On 06.1.1974, at 8.30 PM, he received
an order to escort Madhavanand from Central Jail, Gayaji in Jeep No. BRB-1400
to Collectorate, Patna. Sh. Ram Prasad Dubey, Jamadar, Chandi Mishra (PW-9)
and 4 home guards accompanied them in the said jeep at 6.00 AM on 7.1.1974.
They brought Madhavanand from Central Jail, Gayaji and proceeded in that jeep
towards Patna via Gaya town, Khijar Sarai, Islampur and Fatua.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 368 They reached office of the Collector, Patna at 10.30
AM. Near Gaya Town Hospital, one red colour motorcycle, one brown colour jeep
and one station wagon of yellow colour, overtook their jeep. The driver of
that motorcycle was in plain clothes, while another person with saffron cloth
was pillion rider. There were four or five persons in that jeep and two of
them were wearing saffron clothes. Up to Patna, the said three vehicles
sometimes were running ahead of their jeep and sometime following their jeep.
They parked their jeep at the place in the North of which was the Collector's
office and in South of which was the Treasury Guard Room. Near Treasury Guard
Room, he noticed one Santri (Constable/Guard) on duty besides three or four
other constables basking in the Sun. When they had stopped their jeep,
Madhavanand expressed his desire to urinate and consequently Chandi Mishra
(PW-9) and others escorted him to a drain nearby and after urination,
Madhavanand was brought back to the jeep. He was made to sit on the front seat
of that jeep. At that time, he saw four persons standing between the office of
the Collector and the park on the road. One of the four persons, aged about
25-26 years, was holding a revolver in his left hand. He was wrapping a
saffron colour chaddar and by his right hand, that person threw a grenade
towards their jeep. The said grenade fell 2 yards from their jeep, but did not
explode. After throwing grenade, that person ran towards the West and they all
rushed after him. The other three associates of that person ran away hither
and thither. He himself, Chandi Mishra (PW-9) and 4 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 369
Treasury Guards ran after that person and after running towards West, that
person turned towards North and again on reaching the banks of River Ganga, he
turned towards the West. He could run up to Dhobighat and on way he threw his
chaddar on the road and before reaching Dhobighat that person fired three
shots from his revolver towards them; however, they escaped unhurt as they had
taken the position. After reaching the Dhobighat that man jumped into the
river Ganga. Two of the Treasury guards followed that man in the water and
they secured him after swimming about 100-125 yards and before being secured
that man threw his revolver in the River. He stated that the man was brought
to the shore and in that process, he had received some injuries. On the bank
of the river, that man started feeling unconscious and did not speak anything.
Three or four constables including him bodily lifted that man and took him to
PIR (Police Information Room). Thereafter, he returned to the place, where he
had parked the jeep. There, he talked to Madhavanand, informed him that the
person, who had thrown the hand grenade, was Vinay Avadhoot and he remained
with him in Ranchi Jail. Madhavanand also told him that one of the companions
of said Vinay Avadhoot, was Ram Roop. He deposed that he would in a position
to identify the photograph of Vinay Avadhoot. He (PW-10) identified photograph
Ex.P-4 of the person, who had thrown the grenade and subsequently was secured
in the River Ganga.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 370
275\. In his cross-examination, PW-10 elaborated that he talked to Madhavanand
outside the Collector Office, after about an hour of throwing grenade. Then he
returned from PIR leaving the person, who had thrown the grenade there and at
that time Madhavanand told him that the name of Vinay Avadhoot and Ram Roop.
(When confronted with his previous statement, it was found mentioned
"Rajasthan Ka Vinay"). He deposed that Madhavanand told him name of that Vinay
as Vinay Avadhoot. (When confronted with his previous statement, the word
"Vinay" was found mentioned at one place and "Vinay Avadhoot" at another
place). At 04.30 PM on 07.01.1974, they had escorted Madhavanand to PIR and
there, he identified Vinay Avadhoot and told his name. In the PIR, on seeing
Vinay Avadhoot, Madhavanand himself pointed out that he was the person, who
threw the grenade and at that time, Vinay Avadhoot was feigning
unconsciousness and was not speaking. He was not telling his name. He could
not recollect whether in his previous statement, he had given the colour of
the chaddar, which that person was wearing as saffron. (When confronted with
his previous statement, Saffron colour was not found mentioned). He did not
recollect whether he stated to the police that three associates of the grenade
thrower ran away here and there.
276\. A scrutiny of the cross-examination of PW-10 reflects that the defence
could not demolish his testimony while describing the incident that had taken
place on 07.01.1974 at the Collectorate, Patna.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 371 Rather, the cross-examination of PW-10 further
confirms the presence of PW-10, members of the escort party, guards at the
Treasury including PW-8, the presence of the jeep and Madhavanand being
brought there by them and PW-10 having noticed four unknown person amongst
whom one person wrapping himself with a saffron chaddar and having revolver in
his left hand. It is also not demolished in his cross-examination that the
said person taking out a grenade from the chaddar, flung towards jeep, in
which Madhavanand was occupying the front seat and surrounded by members of
the escort party including PW-10. It has further not demolished that remaining
three persons having run away here and there from the scene of the crime, the
PW-8, Gorakhnath along with PW-9 and PW-10 chasing the culprit, who flung the
grenade and culminating into his arrest from the river Ganga, into which he
jumped. They also could not dispute the testimony of PW-10 that on
conversation by him with Madhavanand after securing of the assailant,
Madhavanand informed him the name of the assailant to be Vinay Avadhoot.
However, the Ld. Defence Counsel have pointed out a few improvements, which
are of lesser importance and not altering the material particulars. Those
trivial improvements are that in his previous statement, it was found
mentioned that name of the assailant having been named as Vinay or Vinay
Avadhoot or Rajasthan Ka Vinay, whereas in the court he has described his name
as Vinay Avadhoot. The other improvement pointed out by the Ld. Defence
Counsel is that in his previous CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 372 statement he did not tell
the colour of the chaddar, in which the assailant had wrapped himself. The
witness also could not tell whether he had stated before the police that three
companions of the assailant went hither and thither. These improvements, which
are trivial in nature, are to be viewed in the grim circumstances where an
unexpected gory event like the flinging of grenade happens; that too against a
person brought by the police. Under such circumstances, the priorities of the
police officials would naturally be towards catching hold of the culprit
rather than to follow the companions of the culprit or to notice minute
circumstances like the colour of the covering cloth. The testimony of PW-10,
who is also a police official and a public servant, inspires confidence and
his testimony went unshaken in any manner.
277\. PW-7 Sh. A.R. Ghosh, Photo Expert of CID, Bihar at Patna deposed that on
7.1.1974, he was posted as Photo Expert at Secretariat, Bihar Government,
Patna. On that day, he went to Collectorate, Patna, on the directions of the
Incharge and reached there at 3.30 PM, where he took the photographs of the
scene of the occurrence. There was lying one bomb type object and he took its
photograph. In all, he took 10 photographs. He brought in the court the
negatives of those photographs, which are Ex.PW-7/1 to Ex.PW- 1/10 and
corresponding photographs are Ex.PW-7/11 to Ex.PW-7/20. Besides that, he also
took photographs of injured person, who was arrested by the police. Two
negatives of the same are Ex.PW-7/21 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 373 and Ex.PW-7/22.
Ex.PW-7/21 is the negative of photograph Ex.P-4. He claimed that he has been
doing photography for the last 25 years. Despite opportunity, the defence
chose not to cross- examine him and thus the testimony of PW-7 went
unrebutted.
278\. PW-1 further testified that Ex.P-4 is photograph of Vinayanand and this
was of the time when he discarded his dress as Avadhoot and started putting on
plain clothes. This photograph has also been identified by PW-8, PW-9 and
PW-10. Madhavanand during conversation, after securing of the assailant,
informed PW-10 that the assailant was Vinay Avadhoot.
279\. PW-18 Sh. Gokhla Nand Sahai, the then officer Incharge PS Kotwali, Patna
deposed that on 7.1.1974, at about 10.55 AM, he received an information that
some explosive bomb had been thrown in front of Treasury, Patna. He along with
some officials proceeded to that place for verification. On reaching there, he
noticed that one jeep was parked and one grenade lying there at a distance of
six feet from that jeep. He deposed that he recorded the statement of one
Chandi Mishra (PW-9) at the spot. He gave dictation based on statement made by
Chandi Mishra, which was recorded by Sub-Inspector Girija Nand (PW-92).
Ex.PW-9/A is the statement of Chandi Mishra, which was recorded on his
dictation by SI Girija Nand, in his presence and it bears his signatures. This
statement Ex.PW-9/A was sent to PS through ASI Durga Prasad for registration
of the case. He correctly CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 374 recorded the endorsement
Ex.PW-18/A in his handwriting on statement Ex.PW-9/A. This endorsement
Ex.PW-18/A, bears his signatures also. He entrusted the investigation of this
case to SI Girija Nand (PW-92).
280\. In his cross-examination, PW-18 replied that signatures of Chandi Mishra
(PW-9) are at point A on Ex.PW-9/A. The rukka (information) sent to the police
station for registration of the case was not returned to the IO after
registration of the case and in fact, it was kept in the police station with
the original FIR. He did not leave the spot immediately after sending of rukka
to the police station and he remained at the spot and the PIR for about two
hours. He had no concern to know the number of the said FIR of that case. He
testified that he had put section 120-B read with section 302 IPC. He admitted
that no death took place in this incident regarding which statement of Chandi
Mishra (PW-9) was sent to Police station for registration of a case. PW-18
answered that the only work, which he had done at the spot, was of sending the
rukka. He denied the suggestion that Madhavanand was not present at the spot
at the time of the incident. He did not prepare any rough site plan of the
spot. Chandi Mishra gave the description of one person in his statement
Ex.PW-9/A, though he referred four persons in his statement. The witness has
seen FIR Ex.PW-92/A in the court and found that at the right top corner, the
date 8.7.1974 is written, (In fact, this is 8.1.1974). It is elicited that
when he reached the spot, member of public, Chandi Mishra and CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 375 police officers were present. No person from the public
volunteered to give information as to how the occurrence had taken place.
281\. PW-92 Sh. G.N. Singh (Girija Nand), the then Second Officer, PS Kotwali,
Patna deposed that from March 1973 to February 1976, he was posted in PS
Kotwali, Patna. He remained there posted as Second Officer till May, 1974. He
became Incharge PS Kotwali, Patna after May, 1974. He deposed that on

about rumour of a bomb blast in Patna Collectorate. He (PW-92), ASI Rameshwar
Prasad and ASI Durga Prasad accompanied Gokhla Nand Sahai (PW-

Police Information Room (PIR), which was at a distance of about two furlongs
from the place where the jeep was parked and the police information room was
not visible from near the jeep. Sub-Inspector Gokhla Nand Sahai (PW-18) took
the statement of Naik Chandi Mishra (PW-9) and at the instance of Gokhla Nand

(Shahdara)  Page No. 376 Sahai (PW-18), he (PW-92) recorded the statement of
Chandi Mishra Naik (PW-9) Ex.PW-9/A correctly. He read it over to Naik Chandi
Mishra, who admitted the same to be correct and signed at point A. He has
worked with Gokhla Nand writing and signing and accordingly, he identified
signatures of Gokhla Nand Sahai at point C on Ex.PW-9/A. Sh. Gokhla Nand Sahai
recorded his endorsement Ex.PW-18/A in his own handwriting. SI Gokhla Nand
Sahai (PW-18) entrusted the investigation of this case to him. He, therefore,
sent the statement of (PW-9) Naik Chandi Mishra with endorsement of SI Gokhla
Nand Sahai (PW-18) to PS Kotwali, Patna for registration of a formal FIR
through ASI Durga Prasad Singh. He had seen the FIR, which is hand of ASI
Durga Prasad Singh. He identified the handwriting and signatures Junior SI
Saraswati Pandey. FIR is Ex.PW-92/A, which bears the signature of Junior SI
Saraswati Pandey at point A. He deposed that he correctly recorded the

not found in a hand grenade, it is considered dangerous and it can blast at
any movement. He described what a live hand grenade is. He admitted the
suggestion of the defence that in the instant case, something was not

December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 386 examination report Ex.PW-138/B of
Sh. A. Ray, article Mark A was consisting of a broken spring with a metal
body, article B was consisting of a metal piece and mark C was consisting of a

(Report of Sh. A. Ray Ex.PW-138/B and Report Ex.PW-138/C of Sh. R.P. Malhotra
are available in Folder R-2)
292\. Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati argued that as per the case of the
prosecution Madhavanand was brought from Gayaji Jail to Collectorate, Patna,
but no document of Gaya Jail or production warrant to show that he was being
brought to Patna, has been filed by the prosecution. She also argued that the
story of the prosecution is unbelievable as Madhavanand could have been
attacked easily during the journey from Gaya to Patna as it was a rural area
and the distance between Gayaji & Patna was about 130 KMs, and it was
difficult to attack at a crowded place like Office of Collector, Patna, where
there was no scope to escape after attack. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that Ram
Swarath Singh of Khusrupur Village referred by PW-1 in his statement, who, had
knowledge about the topography of the area, has not been examined. Ld. Defence
Counsel has further argued that Madhavanand has not been examined for
identification of his assailant Vinayanand as stated by PW-9 and PW-10 in
their respective cross- examination. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that no public
person was joined a witness to the incident of attack on Madhavanand and only
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 387 police officials, who are interested witnesses, have
been examined to prove the incident. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the
Investigation Officer made no effort to recover the saffron chaddar, which
Vinayanand has alleged to have thrown while fleeing from the spot towards
Ganga. Further, she points out a lapse in the investigation in not recovering
three empty cartridges as Vinayanand has fired thrice while fleeing from the
spot towards Ganga. She would further urge a defect in the investigation in
not recovering the revolver, when there was only waist-deep water in the
Ganga.
293\. PW-9 Chandi Mishra Hawaldar and PW-10 Kailash Singh Hawaldar have
already testified that they have brought Madhavanand from Gayaji Jail to
Collectorate, Patna and in view of their trustworthy ocular testimony, there
remains no requirement to place on record production warrant or any document
of Gaya Jail. These witnesses as well as PW-8 Jai Kishan Singh have given
detailed narration as to how a hand grenade was thrown towards the jeep in
which Madhavanand was sitting which fell at a distance of 2/3 yards from the
jeep and the grenade did not explode. It had already come in the testimony of
the prosecution witnesses that after throwing the hand grenade, the assailant
ran towards the Ganga and jumped into it. PW-8 Ct. Jai Kishan and Gorakh Nath
Singh brought him to banks of the River and they have identified the
photograph of the assailant Ex.P-4 as the said assailant. Consequently, they
secured him from River Ganga and this photograph has also been identified by
PW-1 as that of Vinayanand.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 388 The entire argument concerning these events advanced
by the Ld. Counsel for the defence is merely peripheral since this court is
not adjudicating any substantive charges concerning the attack on the life of
Madhavanand, which happened prior to the murder of L.N. Mishra. It should be
borne in mind that these incidents are only put forth by the prosecution in
the backdrop of the charge u/s 120-B IPC in respect of conspiracy hatched to
kill Madhavanand, Abdul Gaffoor, L.N. Mishra and others. This court, in fact,
need not go into details to find out the complicity of the assailants of
Madhavanand, but only consider it as a backdrop to prove the charge under
Section 120-B of IPC, which is sufficiently proved through the eye witness
account of PW-8 to PW-10, which is appreciated already. It is only superfluous
to urge here that Madhavanand would have been attacked on the way from Gaya to
Patna and not in a city like Patna. As regards, the non- recovery of certain
material objects concerning the incident of attack on Madhavanand, the ruling
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mritunjoy Biswas Vs. Pranab @ Kuti Biswas and
another, 2014 (1) RCR (Criminal) 1, cannot be lost sight of. It is held in
Para No. 31 to 33 therein that if direct evidence is there, non-recovery of
weapon or pistol or spent cartridges does not derail from the case of the
prosecution. Reference can also be given to the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Krishna Mochi & Others Vs. State of Bihar, 2002 (6) SCC 81,
holding therein "It has been then submitted on behalf of the appellants that
nothing incriminating could be CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 389 recovered from them, which
goes to show that they had no complicity with the crime. In my view, recovery
of no incriminating material from the accused cannot alone be taken as a
ground to exonerate them from the charges, more so when their participation in
the crime is unfolded in ocular account of the occurrence given by the
witnesses, whose evidence has been found by me to be unimpeachable."
Similarly, if only police officials have been examined by the prosecution, and
private witness are not examined, it does not affect the case of the
prosecution, as held in C. Ronald and another Vs. State, 2011 (12) SCC 428,
(Para 21 and 22) by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
294\. The cumulative effect of the deposition of PW-7 to PW-10 conclusively
establishes that an attempt on the life of Madhavanand had taken place on
07.01.1974 and further the assailant was Vinay @ Vinay Avadhoot (Proclaimed
Offender) and he along with his three henchmen had followed the said
Madhavanand, who was being brought in custody to Patna. It comes to the fore
from the testimony of PW-1 that this Madhavanand is a defector and deserter of
the cult, turning hostile to the interest of the cult by becoming an approver
in a murder case against its founder. Further, this evidence proved from the
testimonies of all these four witnesses regarding an unsuccessful attempt on
the life of Madhavanand corroborates the deposition of PW-1 as regards the
conspiracy hatched in October 1973 at Trimohan to eliminate Madhavanand by
Vinayanand, is believable. It is the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 390 defence which got
elicited the name of assailant as Vinay Avadhoot in cross-examination of
PW-10. This incident has been duly registered with PS Kotwali as per the
evidence of PW-18, which is discussed above.
295\. As regards the oral and documentary evidence proved through witnesses
PW-18, PW-92, PW-134, PW-138, PW-140 and PW-150, shows that the hand grenade
was a live one, which was later detonated and exploded with the help of
PW-150. The evidence of PW-138 and PW-150, which remained un-derided,
establishes that the hand grenade contained TNT, a dangerous explosive
substance. This incident is to be viewed only to substantiate the theory the
prosecution that there was a conspiracy hatched at Trimohan in October 1973
when they decided to eliminate the perceived enemies including Madhavanand, on
whom the hand grenade was flung.
296\. It is argued by Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate that in his Application by way
of Memo of Evidence dated 08.02.1975 Ex.PW- 134/DD (also exhibited as
Ex.PW-151/DF), filed by the Investigation Officer Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134),
before the Judicial Magistrate, Patna, names of accused Santoshanand,
Sudevanand and Arteshanand were not mentioned regarding the incident dated
07.1.1974. She also points out that in other applications Ex.PW-134/DA (dated
01.08.1974), Ex.PW-134/DB (dated 12.07.1974) and Ex.PW-151/DB (dated
26.07.1974) filed before the Magistrate; PW-134 Sh. M.M.P.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 391 Sinha has mentioned that conspiracy was hatched by
Vinayanand, Visheshwaranand, Rudranand and Shankaranand at Village Arrah. She
argued that in the charge sheet, Investigation Officer, without any reason or
justification, has shown the place of conspiracy to be at Village Trimohan
instead of Village Arrah and names of Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Arteshanand
are mentioned. However, I do not find any force in this argument since the
said applications were filed when the matter was still under initial
investigation. I have perused all these applications and found that all these
details are mentioned by the Investigation Officer based on the disclosure
made by Vinayanand Avadhoot in the course of his interrogation soon after his
unsuccessful attempt to escape after throwing the grenade on the jeep of
Madhavanand at Patna Collectorate on 07.01.1974. Based on the disclosure by
Vinayanand, IO has mentioned that Vinayanand has informed about the plan to
kill Madhavanand Avadhoot hatched in Anand Marg Primary School, Arrah by
Visheshwaranand Avadhoot, Shankaranand Avadhoot and Vinayanand Avadhoot.
(These applications are available in Folder R-18). Moreover, this court cannot
ignore the fact that at that point of time, the investigation was at its
initial stage. The ultimate result of investigation was filed subsequently by
the Investigation Officer in the form of charge sheet u/s 173 Cr. PC of which
cognizance was taken by the court and ultimately after considering the
evidence collected CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 392 during investigation, my Ld.
Predecessor ordered for framing of the charge.
297\. It is further argued by Ld. Defence counsel Ms. Sima Gulati that with
regard to the incident at Collectorate Patna, all the witnesses examined by
the prosecution are police officials, who are interested one and no attempt
was made to join any private witness from the public when admittedly there was
a huge crowd after the incident. In this regard, it would be relevant to refer
following observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Kerala Vs. M.M.
Mathew and another, AIR 1978 SC 1571: -
> "the evidence of the investigating officer cannot be branded as highly
> interested on ground that they want that the accused are convicted. Such a
> presumption runs counter to the well recognized principle that prima facie
> public servants must be presumed to act honestly and conscientiously and
> their evidence has to be assessed on its intrinsic worth and cannot be
> discarded merely on the ground that being public servants they are
> interested in the success of their case."
Therefore, the public servants, who have deposed, must be presumed to act
honestly and conscientiously and their evidence has to be assessed on its
intrinsic worth and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that being public
servants they are interested in the success of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 393 their case.
Moreover, it is a matter of common prudence that generally private persons in
such type of incident are scared of becoming witnesses. Therefore, the
argument of Ld. Defence Counsel falls to the ground.
30) Aftermath the attempt on Madhavanand.
298\. PW-1 deposed that at about 9-10 AM, on 8th January (1974) Gopalji came
there (Chautham) with a newspaper, which contained the details of
Madhavanand's life. Gopalji suggested to him that he should shift to his
farmhouse at Tilihar on the other side of the Kosi River. He told Gopalji that
Santoshanand and others would be coming from Patna by 15th January (1974)
whereon Gopalji advised him to wait for them at Tilihar. Accordingly, he went
to Tilihar where he remained until 15th January (1974). PW-1 further testified
that when Santoshanand and others did not reach there, he (PW-1) came back to
Gopalji house at Chautham. After 2-3 days, Arteshanand and Sudevanand also
reached there but Santoshanand did not come there. Sudevanand narrated him all
the details of attack made on Madhavanand. He further deposed that on 17th
January (1974), they received a telegram from Santoshanand in the name of
'Prabu' addressed to Gopalji Ex.PW-1/S that they should wait for 'satsang'.
After one or two days of telegram, Santoshanand came to Chautham and discussed
attack on Madhavanand in detail. Santoshanand expressed his regret that they
had not been successful in their mission. At that time, he himself,
Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Gopalji and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 394 Santoshanand were
present. Santoshanand asked him to go and bring Ram Kumar so that further
programme could be chalked out. It was decided that further course of action
be deferred for the time being as they were short of arms and ammunitions. In
or about 4th week of January, (1974), he (PW-1) went to Trimohan to bring Ram
Kumar but he refused to come. It was decided that they would all go to Ram
Kumar's house on 6th February and the situation would be reviewed there and
further programme would be settled. They were asked to take shelter at their
respective places and should reach at Ram Kumar's house on 6 th February 1974.
He (PW-1) came to Trimohan at Ram Kumar's house and all others reached there
on 6th February. He himself, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Ram Kumar
and Tyageshwaranand participated in a meeting on 6th February 1974 at the
house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan. In the meeting, Santoshanand suggested that
they were short of arms and ammunitions and another meeting would be held on
15.2.1974. In the meantime, they should go to their respective convenient
places for shelter. Tyageshwaranand was VSS Organizer of Bihar State and he
(PW-1) told them that he had no shelter in Bihar and so Santoshanand told him
that Abdul Gaffoor was fighting elections from Madhubani constituency and he
should go there to keep a watch on his activities.
299\. In the cross-examination, it is found that at 06.30 AM on 07.01.1974,
PW-1 reached Chautham, but Gopalji was not there at that time. He has not
stated before the Magistrate that on reaching CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 395 Chautham,
Gopalji came there next day i.e. on 08.1.1974. He deposed that he has stated
before the Magistrate that on 08.1.1974 Gopalji came there and brought
newspaper containing the news that an attack had been made on Madhavanand in
the Collectorate at Patna. He was confronted with the statement Ex.PW-1/X
where the words "they have read news in the newspaper" is not mentioned. He
has not stated before the Magistrate that Gopalji had asked him to stay at
Tilihar. He explained that Magistrate did not ask of his activities after
incident of Madhavanand. He did not state in his previous statement that on
17th January (1974), they received a telegram from Santoshanand by the name of
"Prabhu" addressed to Gopalji that they should wait for "Satsang". He also did
not state that after one or two days of the telegram, Santoshanand came to
Chautham and question of unsuccessful attempt of Madhavanand's life was
discussed or that Santoshanand has expressed his regret for the failure of the
mission. He also did not tell Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Gopalji and
Santoshanand were present at that time or that Santoshanand asked him to come
and bring Ram Kumar for planning further programme. It is further found in his
cross-examination that he did not state before the Magistrate that it was
decided that further course of action shall be deferred as they were short of
arms and ammunition. He did not state before the Magistrate that in or about
fourth week of January, he went to Trimohan to bring Ram Kumar or he refused
to come. He also did not state that when he came back, it was decided that
they would go to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 396 Ram Kumar's house on 06.02.1974, where
situation was to be reviewed and further programme was to be settled. He also
did not state before the Magistrate that when all others left, he came to
Trimohan at Ram Kumar's house or that he reached Trimohan a fortnight before
6th February, when all other persons reached there on 06.02.1974. He also did
not state that he himself, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Ram Kumar
and Tyageshwaranand reviewed the entire working. He also did not tell the
Magistrate that Santoshanand at that time suggested that as they were in short
supply of arms and ammunition, another meeting would be held on 15.02.1974 and
in the meantime, they should go to their respective places. In his further
cross-examination, PW-1 replied that there was no residential house near the
house or farmhouse of Gopalji in Tilihar, which was across Kosi River.
However, there were small farmers in their huts but he had no connection with
them. It is further elicited from PW-1 that on 17.1.1974, Santoshanand told
him at Chautham at Gopalji's house that Bihar Police was looking for the
culprits in Madhavanand's case. He was not reading newspaper regularly from
7.1.1974 to 17.1.1974 and he read the newspaper on 8.1.1974, wherein there was
news about it. He was at Tilihar, which is the farmhouse of Gopalji for the
period from 9.1.1974 to 17.1.1974. He stated that he and Santoshanand went
underground after 7.1.1974 and he had interest in the Organisation until
9.2.1974 when he was at Lahariya Sarai.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 397
300\. Telegram Ex.PW-1/S (D-68) is available in Folder R-4.) This telegram was
sent from Calcutta to Gopalji, at Chautham with message "Inform Satsang may be
delayed Parbu". As per postal seal- cum-stamp, it was received in due course
of business at Chautham on 17.1.1974. (This was recovered from house search of
Gopalji on 17.5.1975 and bears signatures of both recovery witnesses PW-91 Sh.
Parsu Ram Singh and Sh. Neel Mohan Singh and I.O. with dates 17.5.1975.)
301\. It is argued by the defence counsel that there has been a sea- change in
the testimony of PW-1 when viewed from the earlier statements he made before
the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr. PC. I have carefully considered the
same. At the outset, it projects as though this witness exaggerating the
events aftermath the attempt on the life of Madhavanand. After the careful
shearing of the improvements/ exaggerations, what is to be deduced to account
for the aftermath events following the attempt on the life of Madhavanand is
that the prosecution successfully establishes the visit of PW-1 at Chautham &
Tilihar, where the house & farmhouse of Gopalji are situated. The defence
could not de-stabilize the version of PW-1 concerning the farmhouse of
Gopalji, which is situated near Kosi River and there being no residential
habitation in and around except huts of farmers. Thus, it establishes PW-1
visited the house of Gopalji at Chautham and farmhouse of Gopalji at Tilihar.
Further, it can be CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 398 deduced that at the house of
Gopalji on 17.01.1974, Santoshanand warning PW-1 about the intensive search by
the Bihar Police, who were looking out for the assailants of Madhavanand. It
is also filtered down that PW-1 was at Tilihar from 09.01.1974 until
17.01.1974 and that accused Santoshanand went underground during this period.
It is also proved on record and through the oc ular testimony of PW-1 that a
telegram Ex.PW-1/S sent by Santoshanand under his assumed name of "Prabu", was
received at Chautham by accused Gopalji at his house in due course of
business. Thus, it can be reasonably believed that all the accused were in
touch with each other even after the attempt on the life of Madhavanand,
making the conspiratorial acts intact and in- chain.
31) PW-1: Leaving the Organisation
302\. PW-1 further deposed that on 7th February (1974), he came to Chautham at
Gopalji house to take money from him. He took Rs.100/- from Gopalji. On
09.2.1974, he came to Lahariya Sarai and met Sham Lal Dass, who had imparted
him Sadhna and stayed at his house. He came to know from Sham Lal Dass that he
had abandoned Anand Marg and advised him (PW1) to say good-bye to this
organisation. PW-1 further deposed that on 10.2.1974, his parents and other
relatives came to the house of Sham Lal Dass at Lahariya Sarai and he along
with his parents were overwhelmed by emotions and started weeping due to long
separation. Due to this reason, he resolved that he would part company with
the Organization and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 399 Revolutionary Group as well. He
met his parents after a gap of 10 years. He did not go to Trimohan to attend
the meeting scheduled on 15.2.1974. He sent a telegram addressed to Ram Kumar
stating that he had changed his line and would not be reaching to attend the
meeting. From the house of Sham Lal Dass at Lahariya Sarai, he went to his
home at Laxmi Sagar, Darbhanga. In the last week of February 1974, Ram Kumar
came to his house and told him that he was deputed by Santoshanand to inform
him that many hand grenades had been procured and he should rejoin the
Organisation. Ram Kumar impressed upon him (PW-1) to accompany but he declined
and told Ram Kumar that thenceforth he wanted to live with his parents. He
neither went to Trimohan nor participated in any activity of the Organisation.
His marriage was solemnized on 2.6.1974 and after one month of his marriage,
Avadhoot Tyageshwaranand, who was in plain clothes came to his house and
before that, he had seen him in the dress of an Avadhoot. Tyageshwaranand
brought a letter in his name from Santoshanand asking him to rejoin the
organization. Tyageshwaranand told him that Baba had also remembered him and
after reading the letter, he returned it to Tyageshwaranand telling him that
he had married and would not go back to the organization. He tore off the
letter immediately. PW-1 further deposed that Ex.P-3 is the photograph of
Tyageshwaranand in plain dress. He hailed from Village & District Unnao and
his original name was Suraj Prakash and he was also called as
Budheshawaranand. He came to his Village with CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 400 a letter
from Santoshanand to persuade him to rejoin the Organisation and his
appearance was as appearing in photograph Ex.P-3.
303\. In the cross-examination, it is elicited that he had not stated before
the Magistrate that on 07.02.1974, he came to Chautham at Gopalji's house to
take money from him or took Rs.100/- from him or that on 09.02.1974, he came
to Lahariya Sarai by bus and met Sham Lal Dass. He had also not stated in his
statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC that from Sham Lal Dass he came to know that he had
abandoned Anand Marg and advised him to say good-bye to this organization. He
did not tell the Magistrate that on being asked, Sham Lal Dass telephoned his
parents and other relations informing them of his arrival at his house or that
on 10.02.1974 his parents and other relatives arrived there. He also did not
state in his statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC that his parents and he himself were
overwhelmed by emotions, started weeping due to long separation and he decided
to Part Company with Anand Marg and the Revolutionary Group. He had stated
before the Magistrate that he gave a telegram to Ram Kumar to the effect that
he would not attend the meeting convened for 15.02.1974 and that he had
changed his line. He sent this telegram from Lal Bagh post office of
Darbhanga. He had not mentioned in his statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC that the
telegram was sent from Lal Bagh post office. He had only stated that it was
sent from Darbhanga. He did not state in his statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC tha t
he came to the house of Sham Lal Dass CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 401 at Lahariya
Sarai. He also did not state in his statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC before the
Magistrate that in the last week of February, 1974 Ram Kumar came to his house
and informed him that he had been sent by Santoshanand to inform him that many
hand grenades had been procured and he should rejoin the organization. He also
did not state in his previous statement under Section 164 Cr. PC that he
declined to go with Ram Kumar or told him that he was living with his parents.
He did not state before the Magistrate that he then did not come to Trimohan
or did not participate in the activities of the organization thenceforth. He
also did not state that after one month of his marriage, Tyageshwaranand
Avadhoot came to his house with a letter from Santoshanand in his name
mentioning therein that he should rejoin the organization and Baba had also
remembered him. He had also not stated before the Magistrate that he returned
that letter to Tyageshwaranand after reading it and informed him that he had
married and would not go back to the organization or that Tyageshwaranand then
tore off the letter immediately. In his further cross-examination, PW-1
replied that his parents met him at Lahariya Sarai and he decided to leave the
organization forever. He informed Ram Kumar by a telegram that he (PW-1) would
not attend the meeting fixed for 15.2.1974. Later on, Ram Kumar came to his
house to take him back and he told him that thenceforth he would like to live
with his parents. He has also denied the suggestion that Ram Kumar had also
left the organization at that time. He further testified in his CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 402 cross-examination that he was not disgusted with Anand Marg
Organisation when he met Ram Kumar at Lahariya Sarai. He became disgusted only
after his parents met him at Lahariya Sarai on the next day as his parents had
started weeping. He did not tell his parents at that time what was he doing as
a member of the Organisation. In his further cross-examination, PW-1 admitted
the suggestion of the defence that his parents used to love and respect him.
However, he added that while in service, his parents wanted to get him married
and he had opposed in this respect. He was 22 years of age when he joined the
service in the first instance. He got married after he left Anand Marg
Organisation. PW-1 testified in his further cross- examination that he did not
inform Sham Lal Dass and his parents, when they met him that he had been a
member of the Revolutionary Group or that he had been making conspiracy to
kill other Anand Margies and other leaders or that he had been collecting arms
and ammunitions or that he had followed Abdul Gaffoor to assassinate him or
watched his movements or that he planned and surveyed the routes by which
Madhavanand was to come for the purpose of his assassination.
304\. It is to be understood the circumstances in which PW-1 changed his mind
on his free will and volition. The defence could not demolish in their
evidence that PW-1 had chosen the different path to become a CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 403 householder, entering into the matrimony by giving up his
mendicant life in Anand Marg.
305\. The line of cross-examination of this witness also reveals the
progression of the mind of PW-1 to have opted for a settled life than
remaining a mendicant, that too after meeting the loved parents, who insisted
upon him to give up the religious order in Anand Marg. His mental disposition
cannot be found fault with. The change of mind by PW-1 in deserting the
organization cannot be coloured with any prejudice or to term it as acting
with an ulterior intention towards the Anand Marg.
32) Identity of PW-1
306\. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the accused persons that PW-1 is an
imposter and neither was an Anand Margi nor was ever assigned any name of
Visheshwaranand. It is argued that the prosecution has failed to establish the
identity of PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava whether he was an Anand Margi or that
he had any alias name of Visheshwaranand @ Aacharya Madan @ Kapalic @ Vijay.
Ld. Special Public Prosecutor has countered the arguments of the defence
stating that there is ample evidence to believe that PW-1, whose maiden name
is Madan Mohan Srivastava and was rechristened as Visheshwaranand after his

307\. I have already referred the statement of PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava
@ Visheshwaranand @ Vijay to the effect that that he remained associated with
Anand Marg from 1964 to February 1974 and initially his name was Madan Mohan
Srivastava. The detailed testimony is already discussed, however to say
pithily, PW-1 initiated by Sham Lal Dass, his immediate superior in Home
Guards, while he was a part time worker and later was rechristened as
Visheshwaranand He also met the founder of Anand Marg on 15.3.1964, became a
full- time worker by taking a one month's leave. He received kapalic diksha
also in the year 1965 and became a Monk of the order Avadhoot. He started
wearing saffron. Ex.PW-1/C is the application submitted by him in March 1964
in his office to leave the station. Ex.PW-1/D is the telegram dated 16.03.1964
for extension of leave. He submitted his resignation letter dated 15.4.1964
Ex.PW-1/E.
308\. PW-1 also testified that he worked as Principal of Anand Marg Primary
School at Jabalpur, and Aacharya Keshavanand Avadhoot (DW-3) was working as
General Secretary in place of Aacharya Sarveshwaranand Avadhoot, who was also
in custody in jail along with Anand Murti for defector's murder case. At that
time, Headquarter of Anand Marg was at Patna. Said acting General Secretary
sent him a telegram that Baba was seriously ill and he (PW-
1) should come immediately and the message in the telegram was "Baba is
seriously ill, come sharp". Therefore, from Jabalpur, he went to Patna. While
replying the court question, PW -1 stated that he is not CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 405
in possession of that telegram as he left everything at Jabalpur. He met
acting General Secretary Aacharya Keshavanand Avadhoot at Patna.
309\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 answered that he had not mentioned in
detail in his statement u/s 164 of the Cr. PC that he was appointed Provincial
Secretary of PFI (Madhya Pradesh). He also did not tell that he was sent to
Banaras for training in Sewa Dharam Mission as it was a matter of detail. He
also did not state u/s 164 of the Cr. PC that he was asked to bring two human
skulls for kapalic sadhna and he only stated that in the year 1965, he was
made an Avadhoot. He stated that he told the Magistrate that he was given
diksha as Avadhoot by "Prakashanand" "on behalf of Anand Murti". When he was
confronted with his previous statement Ex.PW-1/X, the name of "Prakashanand"
was not found mentioned. He did not state to the Magistrate that he was sent
to Indore where he started monthly and fortnightly papers for PFI, such as
"Malwa Pahari" and "Yodha" which was published from Jhansi. He admitted the
suggestion of the defence that when a person is made Avadhoot, his name is
changed at that very time. He confirmed that he was given the name
"Visheshwaranand Avadhoot" on becoming an "Avadhoot". He replied that while
posted as Editor at Indore, he used to purchase papers from Purshottam
Printing Press and he was not dealing with the Government for purchase of the
paper. He was aware that Government gives quota of papers for all journals but
they have not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 406 applied to the Government for the quota of
paper as they used to publish only 500 copies. He had oral understanding with
Purshottam Printing Press at Indore to the effect that they would supply
papers to them as required. At Page No. 90, he (PW-1) further admitted the
suggestion of the defence that he used to send copy of the journal to the
Government. He used to send it by post and not with a covering letter. In his
further cross-examination PW-1 answered that he has no knowledge whether the
Government had ordered any secret memo giving particulars of the person
involved in the case including Visheshwaranand Avadhoot @ Vijay @ Hans Lal S/o
Sh. Daroga Singh of Village Tenduni, District Bhojpur or that he was the
absconder. He is also not aware whether a reward of Rs.500/- was announced for
the person, who would get such person arrested. He also denied the suggestion
that he was an imposter and not the real Visheshwaranand. He also denied the
suggestion that real Visheshwaranand is still absconding. It is elicited that
he did not state before the Magistrate about his transfer to Anand Marg
Primary School at Bilaspur where he worked until August 1972. He did not
remember the name of the owner of the house in which the school was situated.
But it was at a rent @ Rs.30/- per month. To a question whether the social
organization of Anand Marg spread throughout India, PW-1 replied in the
affirmative and added that there were children homes, schools and hospitals
and they were controlled from the head quarter. There were relief centers
also. When the head CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 407 quarter was at Patliputra, the
activities of the Organisation throughout the country used to be coordinated
by the head quarter. He admitted that this Organisation had branches in
various countries also for social service. He testified that in the beginning,
letters of appointment as member of Anand Marg School were not issued from the
head quarter but later on about the year 1969, such letters started being
issued. He had not received any letter of appointment as Principal of School
at Jabalpur. He received the transfer letter from Bilaspur to Jabalpur through
one Brahmchari, who had come from Headquarter to replace him. He volunteered
to say that he had been submitting progress report to Headquarter as Principal
at Jabalpur. There was a law department in the Anand Marg Organisation. The
lawyer member of the law department was Ram Tanuk, who had appeared in the
court on defence side. He did not meet Sh. Ram Tanuk, Advocate to enquire
about the difficulty in release of Anand Murti. In his further cross-
examination, it is found that he became VSS member in the year 1965 as at that
time a person below 45 years of age had to be member of VSS compulsorily in
their capacity as Anand Margi. Sh. Satyanand Avadhoot was Incharge of VSS in
the year 1965, who was later on arrested in Defector's murder case.
Thereafter, one Sambodhanand, who was an absconder in defector's murder, was
the Incharge. After him, Madhavanand Avadhoot became the Incharge. In the year
1973, Madhavanand was the Incharge of VSS. He admitted the suggestion of the
defence that majority of Anand Margies were in government CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 408
service. It is elicited further that VSS camp used to be held twice a year.
These camps used to be held in open fields. About 500 persons used to visit
these camps. These camps were organised in solitary places. The activities in
the camps were visible to the passerby. There used to be erected boundaries in
order to prevent from outsiders coming in. He admitted that VSS workers used
to be deputed to render social service to the people in the relief so required
during calamities like earth quake, draught and cyclone and also on the
occasion of migration consequent to Bangladesh War.
310\. In his further cross-examination, PW-1 answered that he did not remember
the date on which he received the telegram of illness of Baba at Jabalpur, but
was in the latter half of July 1973. The telegram was delivered to him at
about noontime. He left for Patna on the same day by train without any prior
reservation. He travelled alone. He neither met Baba in jail nor did he go to
court at Patna to attend court proceedings. He stayed at Patna for three or
four days at that time. He did not go to the court to meet the Baba. He had
talked with the workers on the subject.
311\. A scrutiny of deposition of PW-1 reflects that he joined Anand Marg in
the year 1964. Sh. Sham Lal Dass imparted him Sadhna. He met Baba Anand Murti
on 15.03.1964. He was imparted training in Kapalic diksha by Baba Anand Murti
in 1965. On behalf of Anand Murti, Prakashanand imparted diksha to him as
Avadhoot at that time.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 409 As elicited in his cross-examination, that while
making statement before the Magistrate about diksha as an Avadhoot, the word
"Prakashanand" was not found mentioned and this improvement pointed out by the
Ld. Defence Counsel is trivial in nature. In his previous statement, he has
not stated about his appointment as Provincial Secretary of PFI in Madhya
Pradesh. However, this omission is not of any importance in view of the fact
that in his further cross-examination, the defence themselves given the
suggestion that as Provincial Secretary, he used to deal with accounts. It is
argued by the Ld. Defence Counsel that he has not stated in his statement
before the Magistrate that he was sent to Indore and publication like "Malwa
Pahari" and "Yodha" used to be published from Jhansi. However, this court is
conscious of the fact that in his further cross-examination the defence have
themselves admitted by giving suggestion to PW-1 that he used to send copies
of these journals to the Government by post and not with a covering letter. It
has come in his cross-examination that he used to purchase papers for
publication from Purshottam Printing Press and this fact has also not been
controverted by the defence. The suggestions made by the defence shows that
the accused are aware about the active role of PW-1 in the organisation in
various capacities. They got elicited that this organisation had branches in
various countries also for social service. The defence has also elicited from
PW-1 the details of VSS and he stated that he joined it in the year 1965. He
informed the names of various Incharges of VSS from CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 410 time
to time like Satyanand Avadhoot in the year 1965, succeeded by Sambodhanand
and after that Madhavanand in the year 1973. He also informed about arrest of
Satyanand Avadhoot and Sambodhanand in defector's murder case. He also
admitted the suggestion of the defence that majority of Anand Margies were in
government service. It is also elicited that VSS camp used to be held twice a
year in open fields and about 500 persons used to visit these camps. The
defence has not at all suggested that the information, so given by PW-1 in his
cross-examination, was not correct. PW-1 has narrated about the Anand Marg
Organisation, its various wings, its various activities, its cult head,
posting of various persons in different wings from time to time and his own
activities. PW-1 has narrated all these facts in so minute details that no
person other than an Anand Margi be possessed of such knowledge.
312\. I have already referred and appreciated the deposition of PW-34 Sh.
Jagat Ram Dogra of Indore, who identified PW-1 in the court correctly. It has
come in his deposition that he took Diksha from Aacharya Visheshwaranand
(PW-1) in 1967 when he joined Anand Marg. In August 1973, PW-1 came to him and
gave him Rs.400/- for purchase of pistol/revolver and after 15/20 days, he
came again in September 1973 when PW-34 told him that he could not arrange the
arms. The deposition of PW-34 ratifies the prosecution story that PW- 1 Madan
Mohan Srivastava is also known as Visheshwaranand.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 411
313\. I have already held that PW-1 visited Indore to collect arms from PW-34,
who identified PW-1 as Visheshwaranand. PW-1 lodged himself as "Vijay Kumar"
and "Vijay Kumar Prabhat" at Aadarsh/Gujrati Lodge, which is corroborated by
PW-19. The handwriting and signatures of PW-1 on the record of the said lodge
have been identified by PW-126A and the record of the Lodge was seized by
PW-83.
314\. I have also referred, discussed and appreciated the statement of other
relevant witnesses namely Sh. Laxman Parsad (PW-16), Sh. Sudarshan Banerjee
(PW-17) and Mr. Clifford Boile (PW-147) of Hotel Republic. IO Sh. M.M.P. Sinha
(PW-134) has seized the folio of Visitor's Register and Bill Book containing
Bill No. 8025 Ex.PW- 17/A on 03.05.1975. Sh. Narinder Nath Singh, Inspector
CBI (PW-
129) has seized the Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R on 19.09.1975. I have also referred
obtaining of specimen writing and signatures of PW-1 by the IO and GEQD PW-43
Sh. B. Lal has compared the questioned handwriting and signatures on folio of
Visitor's Register Ex.PW-1/P (Q-8) and Cash Voucher Ex.PW-1/R (Q-9) of Hotel
Republic with his admitted writing and signatures Mark A-73 to A-77 on
Ex.PW-1/T to Ex.PW-1/V and specimen handwriting and signatures S-45 to S-59
(Ex.PW1/W-1 to PW-1/W-15). PW-43 has given his expert opinion and deposed that
the writer of the questioned, admitted and specimen writing is the same i.e.
PW-1. Here it is relevant to mention that while PW-1 stayed at Republic Hotel,
Patna, he assumed the name of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 412 Shankar Kumar Gupta of Karol
Bagh, Delhi and his handwritings and signatures have been identified by
PW-126A.
315\. PW-1 was posted as Principal of Anand Marg Public School at Jabalpur,
during the year August 1972 to July 1973. In his re- examination, he admitted
certain documents, which were in his handwriting and bearing his signatures as
Visheshwaranand during his tenure as Principal. He deposed that the document
Ex.PW-1/Z is Children Home's Progress Report and he has filled up its blanks
in his handwriting by point A and B. The Tour Programme Ex.PW-1/ZA is entirely
in his own handwriting and he has signed as Visheshwaranand Avadhoot with date
as 23/10/72. The writing on the reverse side Ex.PW-1/ZB is also in his
handwriting. He has seen the document Ex.PW-1/ZC, which is the record of
Personal Work done and this is in his handwriting within red circle. It bears
his signature at Point A. He was shown Monthly Progress Report of Anand Margi
Primary School, Jabalpur Ex.PW-1/ZD and identified his signatures at Point A
as Ac Visheshwaranand Avadhoot and he mentioned the date at Point B, which is
of March 73. The figure of the date is torn off. He identified his writing on
this document encircled red colour. He has also seen the telegram, on the
backside of which there is writing in red circle Ex.PW-1/ZE and he had
received this telegram. This telegram bears the postal stamp dated 16.01.1973
and this is addressed to Visheshwaranand Avadhoot C/o Kishore Lal Jaiswal,
Garha Road, Jabalpur. (There is a presumption of correctness of the telegram
under CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 413 Section 88 of Indian Evidence Act 1872 which is
connected to PW-1 and the same is now exhibited as Ex.PW-1/ZX). He has also
seen the Notebook Ex.P-11 and on the title cover, the words reading as "Notes
on Social Philosophy" are written in his handwriting, which are Ex.PW-1/ZF. On
the first page, the words reading as "Ac Visheshwaranand Avadhoot" with date
7/4/71 is in his handwriting, which is Ex.PW-1/ZF-1. At page No. 186, the
writing within red circle Ex.PW-1/ZF-3 is also in his handwriting. Page No.
187-196 are also in his handwriting. He received a Telegram Ex.PW-1/ZG
(23.02.1973) and it was addressed to him as Visheshwaranand.
316\. In his cross-examination, PW-1 admitted that there is no page number on
the weekly Progress Report Ex.PW-1/Z. This report used to be sent to Ranchi
either by ordinary post or through some Anand Margi, who was going to that
place. This is an office copy. He deposed that he remained posted in Jabalpur
Primary School from August 1972 to July 1973. He admitted the suggestion that
on Ex.PW-1/ZA the date is mentioned as 23.10.1972. He explained that he was
transferred to Jabalpur in August 1972 from Bilaspur. He was Incharge of
Bilaspur and Jabalpur, Diocese for want of a good worker at Bilaspur. He
started the Note Book Ex.P-11 from April 1971 till about 15.05.1971 and during
this period he was sick and remained hospitalized at Lucknow. He deposed that
there is no date on Ex.PW- 1/ZE on the reverse of the telegram. He received
this telegram, while posted at Jabalpur, but did not remember the month. There
is no CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 414 writing in his hand on the Telegram Ex.PW-1/ZG. At
the time of his deposition in the court on 20.05.1981, the PW-1 could not
recollect the name of the students and their father's name from amongst the
children studying in the school when report Ex.PW-1/Z was seen. He also could
not remember the number of the house in which the school was situated and name
of the owner of the building. However, he deposed that the rent of building
was Rs.30/- per month. He used to get the receipts in lieu of payment of rent
from the landlord. It has further come in his testimony that in a separate
file, the receipts used to be tagged and he had left the place. In his cross-
examination, PW-1 explained about the court fees of Rs.15/- on Ex.PW-1/ZD to
the effect that this school was being run previously on Garha Road and due to
the shortage of the funds, the rent could not be paid by the Principal. A
civil suit was filed against Anand Marg's Principal, he received the summons,
and a compromise was arrived at between the parties, for which the court fees
of Rs.15/- was paid. In his further cross- examination, PW-1 replied that
sometimes he writes his name as Avadhoot Visheshwaranand, sometimes as
Aacharya Visheshwaranand and sometimes as V. Avadhoot. The words "Monthly
Report of School" on the reverse side on Ex.PW-1/ZE and marked X are in his
handwriting. In his cross-examination, he asserted that there was no other
person known by the name of Visheshwaranand in Anand Marg Organization.

for the month of February and March 1973 and this is also signed by Aacharya
Visheshwaranand (PW-1). The date is torn off beneath the signature though the
month and year are legible as March 1973. Ex.P-11 is a Notebook and the title
is written as "Notes on Social Philosophy" at point Ex.PW-1/ZF. On opening of
this notebook, the first page Ex.PW-1/ZF-1 bears the name of AC
Visheshwaranand Avadhoot (PW-1) with date 07.04.1971, beneath his name. At
page No. 186 of this notebook, the writing Ex.PW-1/ZF-3 is in the handwriting
of PW-
1\. (All these documents are available in Folder R-3).
318\. The document Ex.PW-1/ZE is the reverse side of a telegram, which bears
some handwriting and PW-1 testified that this writing on the backside of the
telegram is in his handwriting. The telegram has been marked as Mark PW-151/E.
Keshavanand (DW-3) sent this telegram from Bombay and it was addressed to
Visheshwaranand c/o Sh. Kishori Lal Ji Jaiswal, Cloth Store, Garha Road,
Jabalpur. This CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 416 telegram bears the round postal stamp of
Jabalpur Post Office and bears its date as 16.01.1973. PW-1 testified about
receiving this telegram, which is now Ex.PW-1/ZX. He also another telegram

(This Telegram Ex.PW-1/ZG is available in Folder R-1.)
319\. The testimony of PW-1 to the effect that the before said documents i.e.
Ex.PW-1/Z, PW-1/ZA, PW-1/ZC, PW-1/ZD and PW- 1/ZF-1 to PW-1/ZF-3 are in his
handwriting and bear his signatures, is corroborated by said PW-126A Sh.
Maheshwar Prasad. I have already given the introduction and particulars of
PW-126A as to how he knew and saw PW-1 writing and signing and is in a
position to identify handwriting and signatures of PW-1. Regarding handwriting
and signatures of PW-1 on Ex.PW-1/Z, PW-1/ZA, PW-1/ZC, PW-1/ZD and PW-1/ZF-1
to PW-1/ZF-3, PW-126A deposed that all these documents are in the handwriting
of PW-1 and bear his signatures. The defence did not shatter the competency of
PW-126A to identify the handwriting and signatures of PW-1 on these documents.
The defence has also not derided the deposition of PW-126A that these
documents are in the handwriting of PW-1 and bear signatures of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 417 PW-1. Therefore, the testimony of PW-126A could not be demolished
by the defence. It is found that the defence has also not derided in the
cross-examination of PW-1 his handwriting and signatures on these documents.
The defence has only given the suggestion that signatures have been affixed on
these documents as Visheshwaranand to create evidence of his identity as
Visheshwaranand. The defence could not demolish the deposition of PW-1 about
his posting in Anand Marg Primary School at Jabalpur. They also did not
shatter that these documents Ex.PW-1/Z, PW-1/ZA, PW-1/ZB, PW-1/ZC, PW-1/ZD,
PW-1/ZE and PW-1/ZF-1 to PW-1/ZF-3 are not in his handwriting or do not bear
his signatures.
320\. These documents were seized by the I. O. Sh. H.L. Ahuja (PW-
151) from Sh. R.S. Chauhan, Inspector, Officer Incharge of PS Gorakhpur on

Generation" newspaper dated 3.8.1973 and 10.8.1973 Ex.P-10. The writing
encircled Mark PW-1/ZF-1 existed in the note book Ex.PW-1/ZF at the time he
seized it and entries Ex.PW-1/ZF from page 1 to 186, Ex.PW-1/ZF-3 also
existed. PW-151 answered in his cross-examination that these documents were
taken into possession by him from hundreds of documents from Gorakhpur
(Jabalpur) vide CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 418 Seizure Memo Ex.PW-151/E and he has signed
all these documents at point A while Inspector R.S. Chauhan has signed the
same at point B in his presence. In his cross-examination, he stated that
during emergency, police has seized these documents from Anand Marg Primary
School, Jabalpur.
(Seizure memo Ex.PW-151/E is available in Folder R-1).
321\. PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha remained Investigation Officer of case No.
24/1974 from 01.3.1974 to 10.6.1975. He deposed that during investigation of
the case no. 24/1974, he came to know that Vijay @ Hanslal S/o Daroga Singh of
Village Tenduni PS Jagdishpur was wanted as an accused and he did not know
that aforesaid Vijay @ Hanslal has also alias name of Visheshwaranand. He
deposed that subsequently he found that he did not have any alias name as
Visheshwaranand Avadhoot. In his cross-examination, he replied that that
during the period when investigation of the case remained with him, Vijay @
Hanslal S/o Daroga Singh of Tenduni was not arrested. He denied the suggestion
that an imposter was created. In his further cross-examination, PW-134 replied
that he came to know of the parentage and address of the Visheshwaranand @
Madan Mohan Srivastava on 22.6.1974 and visited his house on 22.6.1974 itself
but he was not found available. There he came to know his father's name as
Ramji Prasad @ Ramji Babu of Mohalla Laxmi Sagar, near Darbhanga Railway
Station. He replied that for the first time he came CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 419 to
know that Visheshwaranand was Madan Mohan Srivastava on 22.6.1974. He replied
that he came to know that Vijay @ Hanslal S/o Sh. Daroga Singh, resident of
Village Tenduni, PS Jagdishpur was wanted as an accused and he did not know
that aforesaid Hanslal @ Vijay has also alias name as Visheshwaranand.
322\. In his further cross-examination, PW-134 at page no. 3384 to 3386, after
perusing his case diary dated 10.7.1974, he replied that Deputy SP C.D. Parsad
gave instructions that proceedings u/s 82/83 Cr. PC be initiated against
accused Rudranand, Shankaranand and Vijay @ Visheshwaranand Avadhoot @ Hanslal
S/o Daroga Singh of Village Tenduni, District Bhojpur. He admitted that after
obtaining the warrant of arrest against these three persons, he handed over
the same to SHO and compliance report was received. On 12.7.1974, he applied
to CJM, Patna for obtaining their warrant of arrest, proclamation and
attachment. He answered at page no. 3390 that he visited Village Tenduni on
29.7.1974 and accused Vijay @ Visheshwaranand Avadhoot @ Hanslal was found
absconding. PW- 134 stated at page No. 3392 that subsequently, it was found
that Vijay @ Hanslal S/o Daroga Singh, resident of Village Tenduni did not
have alias name of Visheshwaranand. PW-134 further clarified at page no. 3395
that they were in fact trying to ascertain from their own sources as to which
of these two persons was wanted in this case vide FIR no.24/1974.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 420
323\. During cross-examination, PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (page 3379) was given
suggestion by accused about alias name of Madan Mohan Srivastava as
Visheshwaranand. By giving him, suggestion that he took Madan Mohan Srivastava
@ Visheshwaranand to his house and kept him for 2-3 days and thus admitted the
case of the prosecution that alias name of Madan Mohan Srivastava was
Visheshwaranand.
324\. The Ld. Defence Counsel then argued that as per the case of the
prosecution PW-1 had admittedly participated in the rally at Boat Club in
April 1973. He was arrested and when it was so, why the record of Tihar Jail
was not seized and filed in this case to show that PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava
had alias name of Visheshwaranand. She also argued that they have also not
filed the record of the Police Station Parliament Street, New Delhi i.e.
Parcha Shanakht (identification slip) relating to Madan Mohan Srivastava.
Nevertheless, there is no force in the arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel as
this had already been answered by the I.O. PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja at page
no.3775 of his deposition that enquiries were made by DSP M.M.P. Sinha
(PW-134) but no such record could be found in Central Jail, Tihar as it was a
minor offence. This has not been discredited in the cross-examination of
PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja by the defence.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 421
325\. Ld. Defence Counsel repeatedly argued that when Investigation Officer
Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134) has come to know on 22.6.1974 that Madan Mohan
Srivastava had alias name of Visheshwaranand, it is strange as to how on
10.07.1974/12.07.1974, he continued to proceed against Vijay @ Hanslal @
Visheshwaranand of Village Tenduni for issuance of warrant of arrest and
proceedings U/s. 82/83 Cr. PC. However, there is no merit in the submissions.
PW-134 has categorically stated that he came to know on 22.06.1974 that Madan
Mohan Srivastava had alias name of Visheshwaranand and visited his Village on
that day and he was found absconding. He also admitted that on perusal of a
note in the case diary dated 10.07.1974 written by Deputy SP Sh. C.D. Prasad,
he had moved application on 12.07.1974 for action under Section 82/83 Cr. PC
against Vijay @ Hanslal @ Visheshwaranand of Village Tenduni and he visited
Village Tenduni on 29.07.1974 and he was found absconding. The matter was
still under investigation and PW-134 clarified at Page No. 3395 in absolute
terms that in fact, they were ascertaining from their sources as to who was
the real Visheshwaranand, out of these two persons. Matter was still at the
initial stage of investigation. Ultimately, the Investigation Officer found
that it is Madan Mohan Srivastava, who was assigned the name of
Visheshwaranand, after he was imparted Kapalic diksha in the year 1965 by and
on behalf of Anand Murti. Even otherwise, prosecution has been able to prove
this fact beyond reasonable doubt through other evidence also that it is Madan
Mohan Srivastava, who CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 422 was also known as
Visheshwaranand. Moreover, there are several admissions on behalf of the
defence that it is Madan Mohan Srivastava, whose alias name is also
Visheshwaranand, which I proposed to deal with in the succeeding Para.
326\. I have minutely gone through the cross-examination of PW-1 and the line
of his cross-examination sufficiently suggests admissions of the defence that
PW-1 has been a part and parcel of their cult before 10.02.1974, when he left
Anand Marg Organisation. Following admissions emerge by the defence in cross-
examination of PW-1 to the effect that PW-1 had been an active member of Anand
Marg Organisation and his identity is established: -
(i) At Page No. 77 of his cross-examination, PW-1 has denied the suggestion of
the defence that he had never left the Organisation as stated by him.
(ii) At Page No. 86 of his cross-examination, PW-1 admitted the suggestion of
the defence that when he joined the Anand Marg, it was not banned by the
Government.
(iii) At page No. 87 of his cross-examination, PW-1 testified that when he was
appointed Provincial Secretary of PFI for Madhya Pradesh in August 1964, he
was not given orders in writing.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 423
(iv) At Page No. 87 of his cross-examination, PW-1 has admitted the suggestion
of the defence that as Provincial Secretary, he used to deal with accounts.
(v) At Page No. 105, PW-1 admitted the suggestion of the defence, in his
cross-examination that in December 1970, he had wavered and thought of
resigning from the Anand Marg Organisation. He has denied the suggestion of
the defence that he was asked to leave the organization forthwith in July 1973
by the General Secretary, when he was called to Patna. He also denied the
suggestion that his resignation was accepted immediately and he was asked to
leave with bag and baggage.
(vi) At Page No. 112-113, PW-1 in his further cross-examination, has denied
the suggestion of the defence that thinking that in Anand Marg Organization,
there were highly placed government servants and he would be able to get
better job by coming in contacts with them, he joined it. He has denied the
suggestion that for this reason, he left the government job and joined Anand
Marg Organization for better emoluments.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 424
(vii) At Page No. 112-113, PW-1 has denied the suggestion of the defence that
he was employed to enroll members to the Organization or that this was his
only job throughout his stay in the Organization and for that purpose he was
getting salary.
(viii) At Page No. 112-113, PW-1 has also denied the suggestion of the defence
that there were persistent reports of embezzlement of money against him and he
was turned out.
(ix) At Page No. 90 of his cross-examination, PW-1 further admitted the
suggestion of the defence that he used to send copy of the journal to the
Government. He used to send it by post and not with a covering letter. (He has
stated so in continuation of his cross-examination at Page No. 88 and 89, when
questions are asked by the defence about the journals "Malwa Pahari" and
"Yodha").
(x) The accused persons have themselves given suggestion to the investigating
officer Sh. M.M.P.
Sinha (PW-134) in his cross-examination admitting the alias name of Madan
Mohan Srivastava as Visheshwaranand. PW-134 has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 425 denied
the suggestion of the defence at Page no. 3379 that he took Madan Mohan
Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand to his house and kept him there for two or three
days.
327\. Accused persons have examined DW-2 Sh. Shankaranand, who claimed himself
to be Dharam Parchar Secretary to counter the Prosecution case that there was
another Visheshwaranand, who was having his alias name as Hanslal and wanted
in this case and that PW- 1 Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava is an imposter and not
a real Visheshwaranand.
328\. DW-2 stated that Baba Anand Murti was arrested in the year 1970 on
murder charge and was released by the order of the Hon'ble Patna High Court in
August 1978. He himself was arrested four years after the arrest of Baba (i.e.
in the year 1974) and was released after lifting of the Emergency.
329\. In his examination-in-chief, DW-2 deposed that he knew Visheshwaranand
of Anand Marg Organization, who belongs to the area close to his village and
his earlier name was Hanslal and he was of his height, which is 5"-7' or 5"-6'
and he had a cut on his right nostril. In his cross-examination, he could not
explain if the cut mark on his nostril was due to some injury or it was by
birth and since when CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 426 it was appearing. He also did not
tell the role and status of Visheshwaranand in the Anand Marg Organization.
330\. DW-2 knew accused persons facing the trial and recognized them. He also
knew Ram Aasrey (Proclaimed offender) but he has suppressed the fact by
showing his unawareness, whether bail application of Anand Murti was dismissed
by the Apex Court. He also suppressed whether a rally was organized at Boat
Club, New Delhi in 1973 as a mark of protest for non-release of Baba or that
accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi were arrested in the
Rally. He could not dare to deny all these important events though he claimed
to have been holding position of a Secretary and joined organisation in 1959.
331\. This witness is not reliable since this witness claims on the one hand
to be the Pracharak (Propagator) of Anand Marg, knowing Visheshwaranand with a
cut mark on his nostril and on the other hand, he is intelligently unaware of
the status and role of that Visheshwaranand in the Organization. He is
intentionally unaware of their Guru having been denied bail and the subsequent
protests by way of Rally at Boat Club, New Delhi or arrest of the accused
persons. DW-2 also could not tell about the post of Dharam Pracharak Secretary
as it does not find anywhere in the hierarchy of Anand Marg stated by him.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 427
332\. He himself claimed to have been arrested by CBI as a suspect for attack
on Madhavanand and he knew and recognized all the accused persons. He was kept
in column No. 2 of the charge sheet. He is one of the oldest associate and
follower of Anand Marg and its cult since 1959, it is only and exclusively for
this reason, he has deposed in the Court to help the accused persons.
333\. In view of the above said discussion, this Court comes to the conclusion
that DW-2 has been a close friend/associate of the accused persons and all of
them were known to him. Hence, he is a partisan, interested and biased witness
and his testimony does not inspire any confidence.
334\. The defence has also examined DW-34 Sh. D.P. Ojha, the then
Superintendent of Police, Samastipur to prove his affidavit Ex.PW- 6/D, which
he has filed in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the said Transfer
Petition of the case on behalf of the State of Bihar. He testified that from
December 1974 to January 1975, he remained associated with the investigation
in relation to the bomb blast since its inception as the matter was of high
magnitude; investigation was taken over by CID the next day as per the
instructions of the State Government. He deposed that he filed an affidavit in
the transfer petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is Ex.PW-6/D. In
his cross-examination by Ld. Special Public Prosecutor, he admitted that he is
aware that the person namely Madan Mohan Srivastava @ CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 428
Visheshwaranand, who is named in Para 9 of his affidavit Ex.PW-6/D, became an
approver during investigation in the case by CBI. He also admitted that in his
affidavit Ex.PW-6/D, the alias name of Madan Mohan Srivastava is mentioned as
Visheshwaranand. Despite this admission by their witness, that it is Madan
Mohan Srivastava, who has his name as Visheshwaranand, the accused persons did
not choose to re-examine him on this specific point.
335\. Therefore, this discussion leads this court to conclude that the
prosecution has successfully proved beyond reasonable doubt that PW-1 Sh.
Madan Mohan Srivastava was assigned name as Visheshwaranand, which is
corroborated by the testimony of PW- 126A, PW-34 and ample documentary
evidence discussed above and several admissions of the defence. The defence
has miserably failed to prove that he is an imposter.
33) Search at Chautham - Arrest of Gopalji
336\. Regarding the search carried out at the house of Gopalji by the
Investigation Officer Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134) on 17.05.1975 at Chautham, the
prosecution has examined one of the search witnesses Sh. Parsu Ram Singh, the
then resident of Village Chautham.
PW-91 Sh. Parsu Ram Singh deposed that he knew about the place Chautham as he
was employed by Murariji of the same Village during 1972 to 1978. He knew
Gopalji of Village Chautham, present in the court (the witness correctly
identified accused Gopalji @ CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 429 Krishan Mohan Singh by
pointing towards him). The house of Murariji was at a distance of 50/60 yards
from the house of Gopalji. He had seen Gopalji residing in the previously
mentioned house at Chautham from 1972 to 1975. He further testified that on
17.05.1975 at about 05.00 AM, he was present in the house of Murariji at
Chautham, when he heard about police surrounding the house of Gopalji. He went
there out of curiosity. At that time, Gopalji was also present. He found
police and C.I.D. men at that place. A C.I.D. man told him that he wanted to
take the search of the house of Gopalji. Many persons from the public were
present there and C.I.D. men requested for services of two persons from the
public in order to start the search proceedings. PW-91 further testified that
he and Sh. Neel Mohan Singh offered themselves as witnesses. Sh. Neel Mohan
Singh was also residing at Village Chautham in those days. Thereafter, two
Inspectors, one Incharge of Police Station of PS Chautham, Gopalji, Neel Mohan
Singh and he himself went inside the house of Gopalji. Police took the search
of the house of Gopalji in their presence. Some cloth badges and some brass
badges were taken into possession. There were eight brass badges, which are
Ex.P-150 to Ex.P-157 bearing the letters VSS, which were taken into
possession. There were about 15 or 16 cloth badges, which are Ex.P-158 to
Ex.P-173, which were also recovered from the house of Gopalji. Ex.P-174 to
Ex.P-176 are the badges of brass and Ex.P-177 to Ex.P-178 are of white metal
recovered from the house of Gopalji. Some pages of blank CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 430
letter pad having some illegible impression of writing Ex.P-179 to Ex.P-184
were also found there. He and Sh. Neel Mohan Singh signed on those pages at
point A and B respectively. The licence book Ex.P-185 was also found on the
table and bears his signature at point A and that of Sh. Neel Mohan Singh at
point B. One book in English Ex.P-186 was also found on that table, which also
bears his signature at point A and of Sh. Neel Mohan Singh at Point B.
Numerous papers were found in the house and some of them were found in a tin
box, which he identified to be Marked A-1. The documents found in the tin box
were consisting of some diaries, copies, letters and loose papers. He and Sh.
Neel Mohan Singh have signed all those papers found in the tin box. All these
papers found in the tin box were bearing some writings. He identified some of
those documents Ex.PW-1/S, Ex.PW- 1/O, Ex.PW-33/A=Ex.PW-2/M, Ex.PW-33/B,
Ex.PW-43/F and Ex.PW-68/A, which bears his signature at point A and that of
Sh. Neel Mohan Singh at point B. The Seizure Memo Ex.PW-91/A was prepared at
the spot and it bears his signature at point A and that of Sh. Neel Mohan
Singh at point B. PW-91 further deposed that after completion of the search,
Gopalji was arrested and taken away by the police with them.
337\. It is elicited in the cross-examination of PW-91 that these documents,
which were found in the tin box, are not specifically mentioned in the Seizure
Memo. He testified that Murariji has also reached the house of Gopalji and
that Sh. Neel Mohan Singh was an CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 431 employee of Murariji. Sh.
Neel Mohan Singh did not accompany him and he came there separately. Gopalji
has two brothers and a stepmother and two unmarried sisters and they were all
present in the house. On asking of police, Gopalji had also signed the Seizure
Memo, but he did not remember whether he signed in English or Hindi. Seizure
Memo was prepared in the Verandah (corridor) of the house of Gopalji. Gopalji
had signed Seizure Memo at the same time after their signatures. PW-91 further
testified that he did not remember the names of the servants of Gopalji as
Gopalji had numerous workers in the field. He admitted the suggestion of
accused Gopalji that Gopalji used to give different amount to different
persons on demand. He admitted the suggestion of accused Gopalji that Murariji
transferred some land in his name when Land Ceiling Act was enforced. PW-91
explained that the land was actually not given to him, but it was only a paper
transaction. He was not aware whether Murariji and Gopalji were on inimical
terms. He has denied the suggestion that those documents, which he signed,
were not actually recovered from the house of Gopalji. He has also denied the
suggestion that after arrest of accused Gopalji, C.B.I. men came to the house
of Murariji at Chautham and stayed over there.
338\. The style of cross-examination reflects that the fact of carrying out
the search at the house of Gopalji at Chautham was never shattered. On the
other hand, the search conducted by the IO is further strengthened since
searching questions were made with regard to each CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 432 and
every items seized. A perusal of these documents Ex.PW-1/S, Ex.PW-1/O,
Ex.PW-33/A=Ex.PW-2/M, Ex.PW-33/B, Ex.PW-43/F and Ex.PW-68/A, which were
recovered in a tin-box from the house of accused Gopalji, reflect that the
same were signed at the spot by the IO Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134) as also by
both the independent public witnesses Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Sh. Neel
Mohan Singh, bearing the date of seizure. The accused persons including
accused Gopalji has not at all disputed that Gopalji had house at Village
Chautham. They have not suggested to PW-91 that he had enmity with Gopalji or
that he had deposed in the court at the instance of Murariji. They have also
not disputed that Gopalji was not arrested from his house at Chautham after
carrying out the search on 17.05.1975. They have also not suggested that
Gopalji was a resident of Village Burail only and not a resident of Chautham.
They have also not suggested to PW-91 that the house, where the search was
carried out, was under the ownership of Smt. Nageshwari Devi, who is the
maternal grandmother of Gopalji. They have also not suggested that Gopalji was
arrested from a flat of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh, the then MLC and an uncle of
Gopalji at Patna and not from Chautham. Rather in the last sentence, it was
suggested that after the arrest of Gopalji, C.B.I. officers came to the house
of Murariji at Chautham and stayed over there.
339\. In the cross-examination of PW-1 also, it is not at all suggested by the
defence that Gopalji had no house at Chautham or farmhouse at CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 433 Tilihar, across the river Kosi. It was never suggested to him
that no meeting of Anand Margies at the residence of Gopalji at Chautham or
farmhouse of Gopalji at Tilihar, took place. It is also not suggested to PW-1
that he never stayed at the house of Gopalji at Chautham or at the farmhouse
of Gopalji at Tilihar. It was also not suggested that question of his visiting
Tilihar at the farmhouse does not arise as the farmhouse had already been
washed away due to flood in the River Kosi in the year 1971-1972. There is no
suggestion that Gopalji had no house near Janta Library, Bhagalpur, nor to the
fact that Gopalji was a resident of Village Burail only. It is also not
suggested to PW-1 that arms and ammunitions were not stocked and kept at the
house of Gopalji at Chautham. Rather at page no. 118 and 119 of the cross-
examination of PW-1, the defence asked the witness as to where the decision to
keep the arms and ammunitions at Gopalji's house was taken and PW-1 answered
that firstly the matter was considered at Bhagalpur and finally it was decided
after Gopalji met them at Bhagalpur to be at Chautham. To a question of the
defence as to whether he met Gopalji at his house at Chautham or Bhagalpur,
when it was decided to keep arms at his Chautham house and PW-1 has replied
that this talk had taken place at Bhagalpur. This line of cross- examination
also reflects a clear admission by the accused persons in their question
itself put to PW-1.
340\. The record reveals that prior to framing of charge, in his second bail
application filed on 14.07.1980 through Sh. P.P. Grover, CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 434
Advocate, before the predecessor of this court, Gopalji had mentioned his name
and address as under: -
> "Gopalji son of late Shri Baidyanath Prasad Singh, resident of Village and
> post office Chautham, Distt. Monghyer, Bihar".
This is a clear admission of the accused Gopalji that he had been a resident
of Village Chautham throughout.
341\. Accused had not put their defence in the cross-examination of PW-1
running into 144 pages that Gopalji was a resident of Burail or that farmhouse
at Tilihar was already washed away in the River Kosi in the year 1971-1972.
They had also not put their defence to PW-1 in his cross-examination that the
house at Chautham and farmhouse at Tilihar belong to maternal grandmother of
Gopalji namely Smt. Nageshwari Devi or that Gopalji only used to visit his
maternal grandmother, stepmother and stepbrothers and sisters there at
Chautham. The next opportunity, which was available to accused persons in this
regard, was deposition of PW-2 and they have also not put their defence to
PW-2 that Gopalji had no house at Chautham or farmhouse at Tilihar. Rather,
the line of cross-examination of PW-2 suggests that the Gopalji is a resident
of Village Chautham. The third earliest available opportunity, which accused
persons including accused Gopalji had when they cross-examined PW-91 and they
have not disputed the case of the prosecution that Gopalji was a resident of
Chautham or that he had a house at Chautham. They have also not put CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 435 their defence that Gopalji was a resident of Burail or that the
search was carried out at the house of Smt. Nageshwari Devi, the maternal
grandmother (Nani) of Gopalji. They have also not disputed that Gopalji was
not a resident of village Chautham. They have also not discredited the arrest
of Gopalji from his house at Chautham on 17.05.1975. They have also not put
their defence that Gopalji was arrested from a flat of his uncle Sh. Uma
Shankar Singh, MLC at Patna.
342\. It is seen in the testimony of PW-134 that search was started at 05.00
AM on 17.05.1975, which continued until 12.00 Noon in the house of Gopalji at
Village Chautham. (He identified the Gopalji present in the court, correctly,
by pointing out to him). Before carrying out the search at the house of
Gopalji, he obtained the help of local police of Police Station, Chautham. Sh.
Neel Mohan Singh and Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) were joined as independent
witnesses before the search. Both of them were from Chautham. Accused Gopalji
was found sleeping in the Verandah (corridor) of his house before they started
the search of the house. He told Gopalji about the purpose of coming to his
house to search it. He along with others offered their own search to Gopalji
prior to their going inside his house. He prepared correct Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-91/A in respect of the seizure made from the house of Gopalji. He
prepared it correctly in his own handwriting. It bears his signatures at point
C. It was also signed by Sh. Neel Mohan Singh and Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91)
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 436 in his presence at point B and A respectively. The
documents seized from his house included a Slip Ex.PW-2/M, Manuscript
Ex.PW-33/D and Manuscript Ex.PW-43/F, Telegrams Ex.PW-1/O and Ex.PW-1/S. All
these documents were signed by him and said two witnesses namely Sh. Neel
Mohan Singh and Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) at the time when he seized these.
All these documents were found in the tin box.
343\. In his cross-examination, PW-134 admitted that numbers of the houses of
both the witnesses were not mentioned in the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-91/A. He
clarified that there was no house number in Village Chautham. After perusing
the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-91/A, he replied that there is no mention of signing
the seized documents by the witnesses. He could not give the reason as to why
he has not mentioned the details of the documents in the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-
91/A. He has denied the suggestion that these documents were not recovered
from the tin box. In his further cross-examination, PW-134 testified that name
of Gopalji was recorded by him in his case diary for the first time on
03.05.1975. He could not assign any reason as to why he did not obtain warrant
of arrest of Gopalji up to 17.05.1975. He did not collect any proof of the
ownership of that house in the name of Gopalji. He explained that he was
accompanied by the local police at the time of the going to the house of
Gopalji and he verified the fact. He has denied the suggestion that Gopalji
was a resident of Burail, District Saharsa. To a question that he had carried
the search CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 437 in the house at Chautham belonged to Smt.
Nageshwari Devi, PW-134 answered that this fact did not come to his notice
during the search. He has denied the suggestion that the Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-91/A is not in his handwriting. He replied that they surrounded house of
Gopalji at 04.15 AM and at that time, Gopalji was found sleeping in the
Verandah (courtyard), of his house. He did not prepare any rough site plan of
the house of Gopalji. There were about 50 persons with him while going to
Chautham. He voluntarily stated that Village Chautham was a notorious one and
for that reason, he took sufficient number of persons with him and some
persons accompanying him were armed. He answered that he had made general
reference about the arrest after recovery of valuable evidence from the house
of Gopalji during the search in the application for remand Ex.PW- 134/DE. He
asserted that application Ex.PW-134/DE is in his handwriting and bears his
signatures.
344\. The defence had not put any suggestions to PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha that
Gopalji (A-7) was not a resident of Chautham. They have also not suggested
their defence that A-7 was not present at the time of search or that A-7 was
not residing in the house at Chautham.
345\. The statement of accused Gopalji under Section 313 of Cr. PC was
recorded by the predecessor of this court on various dates from 16.11.1998 to
02.11.2001. While giving his introduction, accused Gopalji furnished his
address as resident of Village Chautham. At CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 438 various
places, he has not denied that he was not having any house at Chautham or that
he was not a resident of Chautham or that he had no farmhouse at Village
Tilihar (Monghyer). He has not claimed in his statement under Section 313 Cr.
PC that he was the resident of Village Burail or that only his maternal
grandmother, stepmother, stepbrothers and stepsisters have been residing in
the house of his maternal grandmother at Chautham. He has also not claimed
that the farmhouse at Village Tilihar was washed away in the flood in the year
1971- 1972\. He has also not claimed that he was not arrested from his house
at Chautham but from the flat of his uncle Sh. Uma Shankar, MLA, at Patna.
Here it is pertinent and interesting to give the relevant extract from his
statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, which will benefit to adjudicate the issue
whether Gopalji has been a resident of village Chautham or whether he had a
farmhouse at Tilihar. This will further enable this court as to whether any
reliance can be placed on the deposition of several defence witnesses examined
by Gopalji on these points or whether those witnesses are examined by him as
afterthought process. The introductory particulars of Gopalji as informed by
him to the Ld. Predecessor of this court at the time of recording his
statement u/s 313 Cr. PC on 16.11.1998, which are as under: -
> "Statement of accused Gopalji s/o Late B.P. Singh age 50 years, Cultivator,

In his lengthy explanation, he has not claimed that he has been a resident of
Village Burail and not of Chautham or that he had no house at Chautham or
farmhouse at Tilihar. He has also not claimed that the house at Chautham and
farmhouse at Tilihar were owned by his maternal grandmother or that the
farmhouse at Tilihar was washed away in the flood of Kosi River during the
year 1971-72. He has also not claimed that he was not arrested from the house
at Chautham but from the flat of his uncle Sh. Uma Shankar Singh, MLA at
Patna. He has also not alleged that the search officer Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-

347\. During the stage of defence evidence, on 11.01.2008, on pointing out by
the Ld. Special PP, after hearing both the parties, my Ld. Predecessor has
recorded further statement of accused Gopalji on some aspects, which were left
out to be asked to him in his previous statement under Section 313 Cr. PC. The
case was still at the stage of defence evidence, when prosecution was allowed
to adduce some more witnesses on 14.02.2011. Thereafter as required by law,
further statement of accused persons U/s. 313 Cr. PC was recorded and the
further statement of accused Gopalji was recorded on 13.01.2012, when he had
taken a flip-flop and twisted the story that he was not a resident of Village
Chautham, but of Village Burail and he was not arrested from the house at
Chautham but was arrested from the flat of his uncle at Patna. In his
introduction he informed his address as of Sector-9, Rohini, New Delhi. The
relevant questions put to him under Section 313 Cr. PC and answers given by
him are as under: -

Ans.: Three persons came in the Flat of my uncle MLA and arrested me and again
said that those were 3 or 4 persons. Again said on that day at about 6 a.m.
one person came in the Flat of my MLA uncle and knocked it and it was opened
by body guard of my uncle and he was asking the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 449 body
guard Sh. Ghutaran Jha by naming me and after hearing my name, I came out and
that person told me that his boss wanted to see me in the vehicle/jeep parked
on the road and the flat was on the first floor and accordingly I came down
stair. They were two or three persons and they pushed me inside the vehicle
and took me in a building/Govt. Quarters at Patna and kept me holding in a
room whole day. Their behaviour was changed in the night and they started
abusing me. They thrashed me also and two or three persons came. Again said
there were several people in the room in the night and under coercion they
obtained my signatures on several blank and written papers. No search of my
house was carried. It was house of my NANI where search might have carried
out.
I am not aware of it.
Q 6 : It is also in evidence against you that those items mentioned in Search
memo Ex.PW-91/A were recovered/seized by Sh. M.M.P. Sinha from your house in
your presence and in the presence of above said two public witnesses. What
have you to say?
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 450 Ans.: I have no knowledge. When I was lodged in jail,
a copy of Search Memo was sent to me and during those days it was Emergency in
the country. At that time I observed that this was one of the paper on which
my signatures were obtained on the night of 17.5.1975.
Q 7: It has also come in evidence against you in the statement of PW-134 Sh.
M.M.P. Sinha, Dy.

184 (D-60) and all these recovered/seized documents/articles were signed by
him and two witnesses in your presence at the time of seizure. What have you
to say?
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 451 Ans.: I do not know. The recovered documents/articles
are fabricated/planted in a fake search.
Q 10 : It is also in evidence against you in the statement of PW-134 Sh.
M.M.P. Sinha, Dy. S.P.
(the then Inspector CID, Bihar) that the Search memo Ex.PW-91/A was prepared
by him in his own handwriting and bears his signatures. What have you to say?
Ans.: It was a fake search. I am not aware of it.
However, this document was not written by Sh.
M.M.P. Sinha.
Q. 25: Have you anything else to say?
Ans.: I was born at Barail, District Saharsa, present in District Saupal of
Bihar and resided with my father and my initial studies were also done at
Barail. I'm the elder son from the first wife of my father. I also have one
sister who was elder to me. After my birth my mother expired and thereafter,
my father again married and from the second wife he had two sons and three
daughters.
My step-mother was not having good behaviour with me and when I gain senses, I
realized that my step-mother had step-motherly CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 452 treatment
with me and therefore, I did not had good relations with her.
During the year 1971, my father expired and my step-mother along with her
children started living at Chautham i.e. My Nanee's house along with her.
After my father's death I took the responsibility of agricultural and I used
to manage the agriculture at Barail and at times to assist my younger brothers
I used to visit Chautham but hardly once or twice a year and this continued
till the year 1975. The property at Chautham was looked after by my nanee and
her staff. During those times, Anand Marg Organization was very popular and
even my brother was an Anand Margi.
I am a licence holder of gun from Barail and I had also voted from Barail. I
was doing various social works from Barail and was also managing a temple from
there.
After the death of my father, his younger brother my uncle Shri Uma Shanker
Singh, MLA Congress was the guardian of my family and I always used to consult
him and take opinion from him regarding the family and agriculture business. I
used to visit Patna for this purpose.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 453 There was one Murariji at Chautham who had dispute
with our family and as I had approached him he personally did not like me. He
had threatened me that he will implicate me in false cases. Murariji was
Zamindar. He had several trusted and personal workers. Murariji was a
Congressman. There was one Gopalji in the village Chautham, who was very close
to Murariji.
My nanee had a farmhouse/kamath at Telihar (PS Beldaur) but the aforesaid
farmhouse/kamath was washed away by river Kosi in its meandering process and
during the year 1971-72, the river Kosi was flowing at the place where the
farmhouse/kamath was located. I say that after 1972, river Kosi was flowing
over the farmhouse and my nanee had no other farmhouse in the village Telihar.
On May 15, 1975, I along with my cousin brother Samrender Narain Singh s/o Uma
Shankar Singh reached Patna from Barail at the MLA flat no. 191, R Block,
Patna of my uncle to discuss the sale of mangoes crop and how to recover the
proceeds thereof. That in the morning of 17.5.75, I was arrested at around
6:00 AM.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 454 When I was in police custody, the CBI pressurized me
to leave Anand Marg and denounce Anand Marg and to give witness against Anand
Marg. My uncle was also called by the CBI to convince me to denounce Anand
Marg and become a witness but my uncle personally told me that he had come to
meet me on the pressure of the CBI.
I am innocent and have been falsely implicated in this case. The documents
shown against me have been planted and are false. For example, D-74 alleged to
be found in a tin box is of 24.5.75 i.e. beyond the date as shown to be the
date of alleged house search and also beyond the date of my arrest from Patna.
(The copy of this document was provided to me along with the list of documents
in the charge sheet).
I did not organize any meeting of Anand Marg and I did not had any arms or
ammunition at any point of time, apart from my licensed gun. I came to know
about co-accused in the jail and specifically Visheswar Anand and Vikram who
had come to the court as a witness.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 455 I am innocent and have been falsely implicated by CBI
in this case.
348\. The following was put to PW-2 in his cross-examination at Page No. 238:
-
                        "Q.          Did you or not meet Gopalji out of
                        Chautham or Tilihar ?
                        Ans. I think, I did not.
                        Q.           Is it that whenever you went to Chautham,
                        he was found present at house ?
                        Ans. Yes. Because date for the meeting used to
                        be prefixed."
This line of cross-examination of PW-2 by accused Gopalji and Arteshanand
clearly establish that Gopalji had a house at Chautham and farmhouse at
Tilihar.
349\. PW-2 further deposed that next day (i.e. 14.07.1974), he went to
Chautham and met Santoshanand there. Gopalji was also present there and he
told A-1 about the delivery of the packet to Budheshawaranand, who kept the
packet in a bag, and subsequent arrest of Budheshawaranand by the police with
the bag containing the packet. He informed Santoshanand in the presence of
Gopalji that Budheshawaranand had thrown the bag towards, which he could not
pick up scared of being arrested. On asking of Santoshanand, PW-2 informed A-1
that the packet sent by him was in the bag and on this CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 456
disclosure A-1 was shocked and he held his forehead in his both hands and told
him that the packet contained three hand grenades. He deposed that he stayed
at the house at Chautham for 4/5 days. He testified that meetings of the
members of Revolutionary Group used to be held at the house of Gopalji and at
his farm at Tilihar. Apart from him, Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Arteshanand and
Gopalji used to attend those meetings. The meetings used to be addressed by
Santoshanand, who used to tell that they had to procure arms for revolution in
order to get the Baba released. In his cross-examination at Page No. 91, he
admitted the suggestion of the defence that on 14.07.1974, he was at Chautham.
350\. The testimony of PW-2 has not been discredited and disputed by the
defence including Gopalji that Gopalji had a house at Chautham and a farmhouse
at Tilihar or that PW-2 went to Chautham on 14.07.1974 and stayed in his house
or that meetings of members of the Revolutionary Group used to be held at his
house and farmhouse, which used to be attended by Gopalji, PW-2, Santoshanand,
Sudevanand, Arteshanand and meeting used to be addressed by Santoshanand.
These assertions of PW-2 have also not been discredited and disputed by the
other accused persons. They have also not disputed the narration of the
incident at Khanjarpur Maqbara by PW-2 to all of them. Rather, by giving the
suggestion that on 14.07.1974, PW-2 was at Chautham, the defence has admitted
the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 457 version of the approver PW-2. Therefore, the
testimony of approver PW-2 stand further corroborated and is to be believed.
351\. The accused Gopalji examined several defence witnesses namely DW-23 Sh.
Chander Mohan Singh, DW-28 Sh. Dhanik Lal Singh, DW-29 Sh. Maleshwar Prasad
Singh, DW-31 Sh. Ghutran Jha @ Laxmi Kant Jha, DW-32 Sh. Krishna Kumar Singh,
DW-41 Sh. Bhupender Narain Singh and DW-42 Sh. Samrender Singh, S/o Sh. Uma
Shankar Singh (MLA) in his defence. He has examined these defence witnesses in
his efforts to demolish the case of the prosecution that he is a resident of
Village Chautham or that he had a farmhouse at Tilihar or that search was
carried out at his house at Chautham. Through the deposition of these
witnesses, he has tried to claim that he is a resident of Village Burail and
the house at Chautham and farmhouse at Tilihar were owned by maternal
grandmother. He has also tried to claim that the search was carried out at the
house of his maternal grandmother Smt. Nageshwari Devi and he was arrested
from flat of his uncle Sh. Uma Shankar Singh at Patna.
The probative value of these defence witnesses is also discussed in the
succeeding paragraphs.
352\. The line of this cross-examination of PW-1 clearly indicates admission
of the accused persons that Gopalji had his house at Chautham also at
Bhagalpur. The defence has also not challenged assertion of PW-1 in his
examination-in-chief that he went to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 458 Chautham and
stayed at the house of Gopalji or that on asking of Gopalji, he went to farm
house of Gopalji at Tilihar. It was not suggested that at that time, no farm
house was existing or that it washed away in the flood or that Gopalji was not
resident of Chautham or that no farmhouse of Gopalji was situated at Tilihar
or that Gopalji has been exclusively resident of Burail or that Gopalji had no
house at Bhagalpur. Accused Gopalji has never put his defence to prosecution
witnesses particularly PW-1, PW-2, PW-91 and PW-134 that he is not a resident
of Chautham or that he had no house at Chautham or that he had no farmhouse at
Tilihar or that he was arrested from Chautham or that he was arrested from
Patna. Accused Gopalji himself admitted by describing his address in the bail
application as a resident of Chautham, apart from giving so in his statement
under Section 313 Cr. PC. Subsequently, accused Gopalji has taken a flip-flop
and started pleading that he has been a resident of Village Burail and not of
Chautham and he had no house at Chautham or farmhouse at Tilihar and in his
defence he has examined several witnesses on these points. The testimony of
such witnesses is liable to be discarded at the threshold in view of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Majid etc. vs. State of Haryana,
2002(1), JCC 154, wherein it was held that when the statement made by the
defence witness was not asked from the relevant prosecution witness in his
cross-examination, no credence can be given to the evidence of the defence
witness. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 459
Court, the deposition of defence witnesses does not require any countenance by
this court. Still, this court in order to unravel the truth, hastens to
appreciate the testimony of those witnesses herein follows.
353\. DW-14 Sh. Mahender Narain Singh of Village Burail has deposed that he
knew accused Gopalji present in the court since his childhood, being his
neighbour. He testified that the father of Gopalji remarried the sister of
mother of Gopalji. Gopalji lost his father in the year 1971. Gopalji was not
having good relations with his stepmother, who used to stay at Chautham.
Gopalji continued to reside at Burail after death of his father. He used to
visit Chautham sometimes. Gopalji had a dispute with one Murariji of Chautham
and Murariji falsely involved Gopalji in a case. It further comes in his
examination-in-chief that on request, he (DW-14) tried to settle their dispute
but in vain. He placed on record a certificate issued by the Headman of
village Burail Ex.DW-14/A, a copy of the Voter List Ex.DW-14/B and original
gun licence of Gopalji Ex.DW-14/C showing his address as that of Burail. He
also testified that he was practicing as an Advocate at Supaul since
12.11.1969 till he joined services on 05.04.1975 as a Judicial Magistrate.
In his cross-examination, he answered that Supaul is at a distance of 11 km
from Burail. He remained posted as a Judicial Officer at Sasaram, Darbhanga,
Samastipur, Jamshedpur, Patna, Dumka, Motihari, Bhagalpur and Chhapra and
stayed at those places.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 460 While posted at those places, he used to come to his
village on Saturdays. It is further elicited that mother of Gopalji expired
long ago before he got his senses and similarly second marriage of father of
Gopalji was solemnized before he got his senses. He could not tell the name of
second wife of Gopalji's father. He was also not aware of another house
Gopalji at Bhagalpur. He never visited Chautham. He took a second-thought and
testified that he was not aware what the activities of Gopalji at Chautham
were. He has denied the suggestion that Gopalji was actively involved in Anand
Marg activities. He was not aware of day-to-day activities of Gopalji except
for Saturdays and Sundays. He also admitted that document Ex.DW-14/A was
neither written nor signed in his presence. This certificate Ex.PW-14/A was
issued on 30.09.1986 by the Mukhiya (Headman) of Burail, Gram Panchayat and
the witness has not stated as to how he identified the signatures of the
Headman. No other person has been examined to identify the signatures of
Village Headman, whether he had died four or five years ago as claimed by the
witness.
354\. It is admitted by other defence witness DW-1, DW-2, DW-3, DW-7 and
others that Gopalji has been an active member of Anand Marg since long.
However, DW-14 has surprisingly denied the suggestion of the prosecution that
Gopalji was actively involved in Anand Marg activities. He also admitted that
Gopalji used to visit Village Chautham but was not aware of his activities
there. DW-14 has never visited Chautham. Moreover, at the time of conducting
the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 461 search of the house of Gopalji at Chautham, Gopalji
was himself found available there with the family members in the presence of
the witnesses including PW-91 Sh. Parsu Ram Singh. DW-14 has stated that
Gopalji informed his father that he has been involved in a false case by one
Murariji of Chautham belonging to Congress Party and if that is so, no
particulars of that case or copy thereof has been placed on record. Merely
because the accused Gopalji was having a Gun Licence, showing his particulars
of village Burail, does not ipso facto means that he was not residing at
Village Chautham. When the search was carried at the house of Gopalji at
Chautham, not only Gopalji, but also all his family members were found
available. In view of this discussion, the testimony of DW-14 does not come to
the rescue of accused Gopalji or his co-accused persons, in any manner.
355\. The accused Gopalji has also examined DW-30 Sh. Prabhat Kumar Singh, an
Assistant working with Arms License Department in the office of Collector,
Saharsa, Bihar. He brought the record of Gun License issued to Gopalji, which
is already Ex.DW-14/C. In his cross- examination, DW-30 has filed Photostat
copy of Police Verification Report for the year 1971. No doubt, Gopalji has
been shown to be a resident of Village Burail. However, it has come in the
deposition of Prosecution witnesses PW-1, PW-2 and PW-91 that Gopalji has been
a resident of Village Chautham and he has his farmhouse at Village Tilihar.
This has been admitted by his own witness DW-29 Sh. Maleshwar Prasad Singh of
Village Chautham, who deposed that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 462 accused Gopalji
who is resident of Village Burail, used to visit at his grandmother's Village
at Chautham. This is also admitted by DW-28 Sh. Dhanik Lal Singh, DW-14 Sh.
Mahender Narain Singh and DW- 23 Sh. Chander Mohan Singh. Apart from this,
there is unrebutted and unchallenged testimony of PW-1 that Gopalji had a
house at Bhagalpur, near Janta Library. Simply because accused Gopalji is also
having his house at Burail and got issued his Gun License and recorded himself
as a voter there, does not ipso facto mean that he never possessed or resided
at other place i.e. at Village Chautham. At the same time, this court can also
take note of the fact that his family i.e. his stepmother, stepbrothers and
maternal grandmother, all have been residing in the house at Village Chautham,
with whom he used to reside there. At the cost of repetition, it is worthwhile
to mention that at the time of search at his house on 17.05.1975 in the
presence of independent witnesses of Village Chautham, accused Gopalji was
found available with his family members. Therefore, the deposition of DW-30
does not help the accused Gopalji.
356\. DW-23 Sh. Chander Mohan Singh @ Rattanji, of village Chautham, deposed
that he is an Anand Margi and took Diksha in the year 1956. His father was
also an Anand Margi. He testified that accused Gopalji had no residential
house in his Village but his maternal grand-parent's house is there. (However,
in his statement, he has spoken "maternalparents" instead of "maternal
grandparents"). In the year 1973-74, Gopalji used to live in Village Burail.
However, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 463 Gopalji sometimes used to visit his maternal
grandparents' house at Chautham but he had not seen any Anand Margi
accompanying or visiting him. The maternal grandparents of Gopalji had a
farmland (Kamath) in Village Tilihar. This farmland was already submerged in
Kosi River in the year 1971-72. There is a common wall between his house and
that of maternal grandparents of accused Gopalji. There was another Gopalji
S/o Salig Ram @ Mukund Babu in Village Chautham, who was also an Anand Margi.
He also knew one Murariji, another Anand Margi of their Village, who left
Anand Marg after arrest of Guru/Anand Murti in the year 1971. Thereafter,
Murariji used to ask Gopalji to denounce Anand Marg or leave the village but
accused Gopalji declined it. For this reason, Murariji continued to have
enmity with Gopalji and filed some criminal cases against accused Gopalji. It
is further gathered from the testimony of DW-23 that PW-91 and Neel Mohan
Singh, who are residents of Village Chautham, were employees of Murariji.
Murariji had land in their names, he asked both of them to depose against
Gopalji in this case, and in return, Murariji promised them transfer of those
lands in their names and not to claim back. He testified that Parsu Ram Singh
(PW-91) deposed in this case on the dictates of Murariji. However, Murariji
did not fulfill his promise and Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) had left him. Since
Neel Mohan Singh insisted to have possession of the land before deposing
against Gopalji in this case and Murariji, did not honour it and for this
reason, Neel Mohan Singh did not come to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 464 depose. Police
never came to the maternal grandmother's house of Gopalji at Chautham in
connection with the investigation of the present case.
357\. In his cross-examination, it is elicited that in the house, apart from
maternal grandparents of Gopalji, his stepmother and her children were
residing. There were about 10/12 rooms in the house. Kamath (farmland) was at
a distance of 6/7 miles from their house and there was one bamboo built Hall
type construction, which might be of the size of about 20' x 20'. This Hall
was used for storage of the crop in addition to stay and cooking (boarding and
lodging). There might be about 40 Anand Margies in Village Chautham before
arrest of Anand Murti in the year 1971. In his cross-examination, DW-23 could
not tell the details of the cases filed by Murariji against Gopalji. He also
could not tell the particulars including the area of the alleged Benami land
of Murariji in the name of Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Neel Mohan Singh. In
his presence, Murariji did not ask Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Neel Mohan
Singh to depose against Gopalji in the present case. He admitted that Neel
Mohan Singh had already died. He (DW-23) along with his brothers have been
holding 7/8 Bighas of land at different places at Village Chautham and those
lands are situated at a distance of 3 Km. from their residence. He along with
his younger brothers used to go in the Morning to look after their
agricultural land and come back in the Evening or even sometimes late. He
admitted the suggestion of the Prosecution that during this CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 465 period of their being at agricultural land, he would not know the
names and identity of the persons visiting Village Chautham. He could not deny
whether some Revolutionary Group was formed to put pressure on the authorities
for release of Anand Murti. He also could not deny whether any meeting of
Revolutionary Group used to take place at the house at Village Chautham and at
the farmhouse at Village Tilihar. He also could not dare to deny whether arms
and ammunitions were used to be stored at afore said residence at Chautham and
Farmhouse (Kamath) at Village Tilihar.
358\. This witness has been examined by the accused Gopalji in order to deride
the case of Prosecution that meeting of Revolutionary Group used to take place
at the residence Gopalji at Chautham and farm house at Tilihar situated nearby
and no search was carried out at the house of Gopalji at Chautham. A scrutiny
of the testimony of the deposition of DW-23 reveals that Gopalji also used to
visit Chautham as his stepmother, stepbrother and stepsisters and maternal
grandmother have been residing. Though, DW-23 claimed to have his house
adjoining to the house of the grandparents of accused Gopalji, yet he admitted
that he, along with his younger brothers, used to leave the house to look
after their agricultural land, in the Morning for their agricultural land,
situated at a distance of about 3 KM. They used to return in the Evening and
sometimes even late. During this period, admittedly he would be not aware of
the persons, who visited their Village at Chautham. Obviously, for this
reason, DW-23 could not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 466 deny formation of Revolutionary
Group to put pressure on the authorities to release Anand Murti or about
holding of meetings of Revolutionary Group in the house of accused Gopalji at
Village Chautham and farmhouse at Village Tilihar. He also could not deny that
the arms and ammunition used to be stored at the aforesaid residence at
Chautham and farmhouse (Kamath) at Tilihar. In his examination-in-chief, he
had claimed that farmhouse (Kamath) at Tilihar was submerged in Kosi River in
the year 1971-72. However, DW-23 admitted in his cross-examination that there
was Bamboo built hall type construction in the size of about 20' x 20', which
was used to store crop apart from using the same for stay and cooking
(boarding and lodging) on the farmhouse (Kamath) at Village Tilihar. He could
not tell the number of the specific lands of Murariji under Benami ownership
of Parsu Ram Singh and Neel Mohan Singh. He admitted that in his presence
Murariji did not ask to depose against the Gopalji in this case for transfer
of the land. He also could not tell the particulars of those criminal cases
alleged to have been filed against Gopalji by Murariji. DW-23 is admittedly an
Anand Margi since 1956\. His testimony rather supports the case of the
Prosecution that sometimes meeting of conspirators also used to be held at the
farmhouse of Gopalji at Tilihar. Further, DW-23 has admitted that there was
one bamboo built hall type construction in measurement of 20' x 20', which was
used for storage of crop and boarding and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 467 lodging.
Therefore, the testimony of DW-23 remains shaky since he is an interested
witness being an Anand Margi in the past.
359\. Sh. Maleshwar Prasad Singh examined as DW-29 of Village Chautham deposed
that Gopalji is a resident of Village Burail. He knew Gopalji, who used to
visit his Nani (maternal grandmother) at village Chautham. His eldest brother
is Leel Mohan Singh. His brother and Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and many others
used to work with Murari Babu. He is not aware whether the police had ever
conducted raid in the house of Nani of accused Gopalji. He testified that the
relation of Murari Babu and Gopalji got strained after 1970 when Murari Babu
joined Congress and had asked Gopalji to join Congress. Prior to joining
Congress, Murari Babu was a member of Anand Marg. In his presence, Murari Babu
threatened Gopalji that if they come in power, they would fix him in a false
case. His brother Leel Mohan Singh is not alive. He stated that he had seen
his brother Leel Mohan Singh writing and signing but cannot identify his
signatures. After perusal the document Ex.PW-91/A, he stated that writing at
point 'B' is not in the hands of his brother Leel Mohan Singh. In his cross-
examination, DW-29 stated that he did not bring any document written by his
deceased brother Leel Mohan Singh for the purpose of comparison.
360\. This witness also cannot be believed as he has suppressed and concealed
the name of attesting witness of the Search Memo Ex.PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 468 91/A. The Prosecution has examined one of the
independent public witness PW-91, resident of Village Chautham employed by
Murariji, who deposed that the search was carried out in his presence and Neel
Mohan Singh was also present with him. PW-91 testified that Neel Mohan Singh
was working with Murariji. PW-91 has also identified the signatures of Neel
Mohan Singh at point 'B' and his own signatures at point 'A'. Gopalji did not
claim in the cross-examination of PW-91 that the real of another search
witness is Leel Mohan Singh. Accused Gopalji himself examined DW-23 deposed
that Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Neel Mohan Singh (correct name) are residents
of Village Chautham, had been employees of Murariji. DW-29 did not state that
the correct name of his brother was Leel Mohan Singh and not Neel Mohan Singh.
He himself stated in his examination-in-chief that he cannot identify the
signatures of his brother. It appears that DW-29 is not connected with
attesting witness Sh. Neel Mohan Singh. Moreover, the statement of DW-29 and
that of DW-14 and DW-23 are contradictory to each other. DW-29 has claimed
that Murariji threatened Gopalji to implicate him in false case, as and when
Congress comes into power, whereas, DW-14 deposed that Murariji has filed a
criminal case against Gopalji and DW-23 claimed that Murariji had filed some
criminal cases against Gopalji. DW-14 and DW-23 have also not given the
details of those alleged cases. In view of this discussion, the deposition of
DW-29 does not inspire any confidence and requires no indulgence of this
court.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 469
361\. Sh. Dhanik Lal Singh of Village Tilihar, examined as DW-28 deposed that
he knew the accused Gopalji, as land of his maternal grandparents was there in
their Village. The constructed premise along with the land in their village is
called as Kamath. He used to visit Kamath of maternal grandmother of accused
Gopalji Smt. Nageshwari Devi widow of Sh. Babu Sheevadheen Singh. The said
Kamath of Smt. Nageshwari Devi is no more in existence as it got washed away
during the year 1970-1972 in the flood of River Kosi. Their village is
situated on the bank of River Kosi. DW-28 had filed an application before the
Ex-Mukhiya of village Tilihar regarding the geographical details of the
property of Smt. Nageshwari Devi, which is Ex.DW-28/1. The Circle Officer at
the bottom of the application itself mentioned his Report Ex.DW-28/2. The
Revenue Officer has signed this report at point 'A' and Circle Officer at
point 'B'. He testified that there was no Anand Margi in their village at any
point of time. Accused Gopalji never had any meeting in his village and
visited the village rarely. His (PW-28) house and land is still in village
Tilihar. Smt. Nageshwari Devi is no more. Ex.DW-28/1 and Ex.DW-28/2 are
available in folder R-XXIV.
362\. Though this witness was cross-examined by the State, the evidence of
this witness is only superflous since he is talking about a Kamath and its
location belonged to the step mother of Gopalji Smt. Nageshwari Devi at
Tilihar. There is no positive assertion to believe CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 470 that
Gopalji was not a resident of Chautham. However, he admits in the cross-
examination that he saw accused Gopalji in the village Tilihar during the year
1970-71 and he voluntarily stated that Gopalji only visited the village and
went away. To a question of Ld. Special Public Prosecutor that it was not
necessary that as and when accused Gopalji visited the Village Tilihar, he
used to be present all the time to which the witness has cleverly answered
that he saw him once or twice only. His family was not related to Smt.
Nageshwari Devi. He moved an application Ex.DW-28/1 on asking of the brother
of the accused Gopalji based on telephonic call, which he had with the lawyer
of the accused Gopalji. He admitted that in the application Ex.DW-28/1 and
Ex.DW-28/2, there was no mention of Smt. Nageshwari Devi. He could not tell
the area of Kamath of Smt. Nageshwari Devi. He has denied the suggestion of
the Prosecution that at the Kamath of Smt. Nageshwari Devi, the accused
Gopalji used to hold the meetings of Anand Margies or that arms and
ammunitions used to be collected there or that he has deposed falsely at the
instance of accused Gopalji being his old acquaintance.
363\. A scrutiny of the deposition of DW-28 projects the suppression of facts
and does not inspire any confidence. In his examination-in- chief, he stated
that accused Gopalji visited his village rarely. In his cross-examination,
DW-28 deposed that Smt. Nageshwari Devi, who was having her Kamath in their
village, never visited it. However, he saw accused Gopalji in Village Tilihar
once or twice. He further CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 471 testified that accused Gopalji
never stayed in the Village Tilihar and he only used to visit the Village and
leave. When Smt. Nageshwari Devi was having the Kamath (farmhouse) in the
Village Tilihar and DW-28 is not related to her, then his deposition that he
used to visit to Kamath of Smt. Nageshwari Devi is not believable. He did not
claim to have been authorized by Smt. Nageshwari Devi to visit and look after
her Kamath. It has come in the deposition of DW-28 that Gopalji has visited
Tilihar, which fortifies the case of the prosecution that Gopalji had a
farmhouse there and for that reason, he would like to visit there in order to
supervise the Kamath apart from joining the meeting of the conspirators there.
He claimed that this Kamath was of maternal grandparents of accused Gopalji
and the witness has thus suppressed the fact of various visit of Gopalji and
instead of this, he stated that accused Gopalji visited there rarely. In his
introductory statement, he stated that his father has been Mukhiya of village
Tilihar since 1968 and so remained Mukhiya till the year 2001. In his further
statement, he stated that their village is situated on the bank of River Kosi
and there was flood in the River Kosi during the year 1970-72 when Kamath of
Smt. Nageshwari Devi got washed away. It is not explained as to how their
house or land got survived from the alleged floods of 1970-72. In his cross-
examination, it is elicited that only Smt. Nageshwari Devi was having a Kamath
in their village. However, in his further cross-examination, he made a
contradictory statement and stated that land of other Kamaths also swept away.
He CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 472 could not tell the area of the Kamath of Smt.
Nageshwari Devi, but claimed that its Khasra number was 8339. He is relying
upon a document filed by him Ex.DW-28/2 wherein on the basis of statement of
some village persons, it is reported that Khasra No.8341 and 4919 belong
jointly to Sheevadheen (who was the husband of Smt. Nageshwari Devi) and
Keshwa Narang. In his statement, he has filed one application dated 10.11.2008
Ex.DW-28/1, which he addressed to Anchal Adhikari, Beldaur (Khagaria) asking
him about status of Khasra No. 4191 and 8341 of Village Tilihar, Anchal
Beldaur, District Khagaria. On the application itself, there was a report of
some Officer with a seal of Anchal Karyalaya, Beldaur Khagaria dated
18.11.2008 Ex.DW-28/2 to the effect that as per the version of villagers of
Mauja Tilihar, Khasra No.8341 and 4191 was estate of Babu Sheevadheen Singh
and Keshwa Narain Singh and most of the land has been sold away and in
Tilihar, it was washed away in the flood during the year 1970-72. His
testimony clearly indicates that accused Gopalji had some interest in the
estate of Sheevadheen Singh and used to visit Tilihar.
364\. DW-31 Sh. Ghutran Jha @ Laxmi Kant Jha resident of Village Burail
deposed that he used to stay with uncle of Gopalji namely Sh. Uma Shankar
Singh, an MLA in the year 1975. He was servant of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh.
Gopalji was taken away by the police in his presence from R-Block, which is
the residence of MLA in Patna. In his cross-examination, DW-31 testified that
when Gopalji was taken CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 473 away by the police, Sh. Baras Lal
Sahu, Gauri Shankar Chaudhary, Bhaskar Mishra apart from him and Uma Shankar
Singh were present. Gopalji was taken by the police at about 06.00 or 06.15
AM. He could not say whether he was taken away by the police or CBI, but they
were in plain clothes. He could not explain as to why Gopalji was present at
the flat of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh. He deposed that till the date of deposition
in the court on 19.12.2008, he never disclosed to anyone that Gopalji was
taken away by the police in his presence from R-Block, Patna. He further
testified that he has come to depose in the court on asking of Samrender
Narain Singh (DW-42), who is the cousin of accused Gopalji and son of Sh. Uma
Shankar Singh, MLC. He visited CBI office after 2-3 days of Gopalji's arrest.
He met two or four persons in CBI office and they did not tell him whereabouts
of Gopalji.
365\. It is elicited from the deposition of DW-31 that he had been servant of
Sh. Uma Shankar Singh and had come to the court on asking of Sh. Samrender
Narain Singh (DW-42), who is none other than the cousin of Gopalji. This
witness is unreliable since he has not disclosed the shifting of Gopalji from
MLA's residence ever since the date of incident to anyone nor did he protest
or enquired. I find that he is an interested and biased witness and has made
deposition to favour accused Gopalji, who is admittedly a cousin of Samrender
Narain Singh (DW-42), with whose father, DW-31 claimed to be the servant.
Moreover, in his deposition it comes out that at the time of the alleged CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 474 arrest of Gopalji from the flat of Sh. Uma Shankar
Singh at Patna, Sh. Baras Lal Sahu, Gauri Shankar Chaudhary, Bhaskar Mishra
and Uma Shankar Singh were present, who have not been examined by the accused
Gopalji. In view of this discussion, I do not find his testimony worth
inspiring confidence.
366\. DW-32 Sh. Krishna Kumar Singh of Village Chautham deposed that in his
presence no search was carried out by the police in the house of maternal
grandfather of accused Gopalji. In his cross- examination, it is elicited that
it takes about 10 minutes on foot to reach house of maternal grandfather of
accused Gopalji from his own house. He also admitted that while coming from
outside the Village, his house does not fall on the way, if one is to reach
the house of maternal grandfather of Gopalji. He stated that he came to depose
in the court on asking of one Chunnu Babu, who is the stepbrother of accused
Gopalji. The testimony of this witness, does not in any manner, help the
accused persons including Gopalji since it is not mandated upon the
authorities or the investigating agency to intimate this witness or to carry
out their duties.
367\. DW-41 Sh. Bhupendra Narain Singh, a resident of District Bhatinda,
Punjab deposed that he had been Personal Assistant of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh,
MLA, Supaul from 1973 to 1977. He used to live in the flat of said Sh. Uma
Shankar Singh at Patna. It has come in his testimony that on 17.05.1975,
police officials visited the said flat CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 475 of Sh. Uma
Shankar Singh from where they took away accused Gopalji. It has also come in
his statement that he along with the son of MLA and Sh. Dhruv Jyoti Singh were
returning after a Morning walk, when they saw police officials in civil dress,
taking away Gopalji in a police vehicle. The driver of the police vehicle was
in police uniform. On the direction of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh, he made
telephonic call in the office of S.P., Patna about the incident and it was
responded by the police officials. They told him that they would talk to the
MLA later on. In his cross-examination, DW-41 could not tell the date and
month, when he joined as P.A. to Sh. Uma Shankar Singh. He admitted that Uma
Shankar Singh was real uncle of Gopalji. Gopalji had come to the flat of Sh.
Uma Shankar Singh on 15.05.1975 in the evening and Sh. Samrender Narain Singh
(DW-42) accompanied him. It is elicited that he saw the accused Gopalji only
in the jeep of the police, but did not note down the registration number
thereof. He had written a letter on the dictation of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh
addressed to some Minister or Officer about the manner in which the police
took away Gopalji. He admitted that a dispatch register was used to be
maintained in the flat of MLA containing entries of correspondence. In his
deposition, he only stated that he saw police officials in civil dress and
driver in police uniform, who took away accused Gopalji and they saw only in
the jeep. He could not tell the registration number of the jeep, in which the
police took away Gopalji. He also did not tell as to how many police officers
were in the jeep, when CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 476 accused Gopalji was being taken
away. He is not sure whether the letter was written to the Minister or Officer
and copy of the letter was also not filed. Admittedly, DW-41 claimed to be
Personal Assistant of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh, a Legislator, related to accused
Gopalji. Neither the dispatch register nor the copy of the alleged letter has
been placed on record. It appears that he has made the statement on the
request of accused Gopalji to favour him. I find that he is an interested and
biased witness. His testimony does not appear to this court, to be trustworthy
since no documentary evidence is adduced to have protested the illegal arrest
of Gopalji from Patna.
368\. DW-42 Sh. Samrender Narain Singh is cousin of accused Gopalji deposed
that accused Gopalji is his cousin. They have studied together up to 8th
standard. His father Sh. Uma Shankar Singh had been MLA for the period from
1967 to 1977. On 15.05.1975, he along with Gopalji had arrived at Patna to
meet his father about his advice regarding mango crop. On 17.05.1975 at about
05.30 AM, he and Bhupender Narain Singh (DW-41) had gone for a morning walk.
While they were returning at a distance of about 250 yards from the tea kiosk,
they met Dhruv Prasad, ADM, who was going towards MLA flat. They saw one
police vehicle parked near MLA's flat. They saw four persons holding the hands
of Gopalji. The vehicle had already been started by its driver. It was 06.00
or 06.15 AM, when police vehicle left the place. His father also came down
from first floor along with Barish Lal Saha, Bhaskar Mishra and Gauri Shankar
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 477 Chaudhary. He was informed by Gauri Shankar Chaudhary
that Gopalji had been taken away by officers of CBI in a jeep. On asking of
his father, Bhupender Narain Singh (DW-41) made a telephonic call to S.P.,
Patna. In his cross-examination, DW-42 replied that he has joint agriculture
with accused Gopalji. At that time, Dhruv Jyoti Prasad was passing by the side
lane of the teashop and then they proceeded together towards MLA's flat. The
number of the jeep was not noted. His father lodged a written complaint with
the Revenue Minister on that day about illegal arrest of Gopalji. In his
cross- examination, he denied the suggestion that Gopalji was not arrested
from the flat of his father at Patna or that he was arrested on 17.05.1975
from his house at Chautham. He admitted that 35 years have elapsed and he did
not make any such statement before any authority. DW-41 has stated that on
17.05.1975, he along with Uma Shankar Singh and Dhruv Jyoti Singh were
returning after a morning walk, when they saw police officials in civil dress
and driver of the vehicle in police uniform and they took away accused
Gopalji. However, DW-42 deposed that he and Bhupender Narain Singh (DW-
41) had gone for morning walk and while they were returning, Dhruv Jyoti
Singh, per chance met them near the flats and the statement of DW-41 and DW-42
are contradictory to each other on the vital point. Admittedly, accused
Gopalji is the first cousin of DW-42 and both of them are doing their
agriculture jointly. His testimony becomes unreliable since no copy of the
said complaint is produced on record to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 478 support his
contention that such complaint was lodged protesting the unlawful arrest of
Gopalji. DW-41 has stated that a dispatch register was being maintained in the
said flat of Sh. Uma Shankar Singh and he made an entry of dispatch of the
complaint in the dispatch register. Even a copy of this dispatch register is
not produced on record by this witness. In these circumstances, I find that
DW-42 is also an interested and biased witness.
369\. On the other hand, from the collective evidence of PW-134, who prepared
a Seizure Memo Ex.PW-91/A, attested by independent witnesses PW-91, the arrest
of Gopalji at Chautham is believable. It becomes believable since no
suggestion was made to PW-91 that Gopalji was not arrested from Village
Chautham. I have already discussed the evidentiary value of Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-91/A.
370\. However, since the accused Gopalji had seriously disputed the seizure
memo as not being in the handwriting of its author PW-134 (a police officer of
Bihar), it becomes relevant to appreciate the oral and documentary evidence
adduced on either side.
371\. In his cross-examination, PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (I.O.) has denied the
suggestion of the Ld. Defence Counsel for accused Gopalji that Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-91/A is not in his handwriting. Now the repetition is inevitable. In his
examination-in-chief, PW-134 deposed that he prepared correct Seizure Memo
Ex.PW-91/A at the house of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 479 Gopalji in his own
handwriting and it bears his signatures at point C and that of search
witnesses Sh. Neel Mohan Singh and Sh. Parsu Ram Singh at point B and A
respectively. It is relevant to note that accused Gopalji has not taken this
defence during the marking of the exhibit and not even suggested so in the
cross-examination of PW-91. Accused does not have any grouse of the signatures
of Sh. M.M.P. Sinha (PW-134) on the Search Memo Ex.PW-91/A.
372\. However, Gopalji has examined DW-38 Sh. B.N. Srivastava, Handwriting and
Fingerprint Expert to adumbrate that the search memo is not in the handwriting
of PW-134. To compare the questioned writing of Sh. M.M.P. Sinha on the
Seizure Memo Ex.PW- 91/A is Q-1 and Q-2, my Ld. predecessor permitted the
specimen handwriting of PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha on the date of his deposition
to be obtained, which are Mark S-1 to S-3 (Ex.PW-160/D to Ex.PW-160/F). By the
report of DW-38, dated 31.08.2009 Ex.DW- 38/1, he opined that questioned
handwriting in English and Hindi including figure work have not been written
by the writer of specimen writing in English and Hindi including the figure
work.
373\. On the other hand, to dispel the opinion of DW-38, the prosecution
examined PW-160 Sh. Narender Kumar, Deputy Government Examiner of Question
Documents, Shimla. He had examined all the admitted, questioned and specimen
writings of M.M.P. Sinha and had also gone through the report of DW-38. A CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 480 detailed analysis of his own in the capacity of an
expert, had deposed at length supporting the case of the prosecution. He took
the assistance of another expert Sh. B.A. Vaid also in arriving at his
findings regarding the handwriting of PW-134. These experts are from the
specialized field namely GEQD (Government Examiner of Questioned Documents).
They have given their Report Ex.PW-160/H and the reasons are mentioned in
their report Ex.PW-160/G.
374\. Unsatisfied with the GEQD opinion accused Gopalji further examined
another handwriting and fingerprint expert Sh. Deepak Jain as DW-43. He
furnished a Report Ex.DW-43/A submitting that the writings are different,
supporting the defence of accused Gopalji.
375\. At this juncture, this court is riddled with enigmatic opinions of the
experts. It is to be kept in mind that if the conflicting opinions arise, it
is always better for the court to apply its own wisdom especially, if provided
under the law. Thus, this court has no other alternative than to exercise the
powers conferred by Section 73 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
376\. This court has examined and compared the questioned writing appearing on
Search Memo Ex.PW-91/A and the specimen writing furnished by PW-134 before the
predecessor of this court on 31.08.1984 Ex.PW-160/D to Ex.PW-160/F, after
perusing the reports and depositions of DW-38, PW-160 and DW-43. My careful
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 481 comparison reveals that the questioned writings and
specimen writings do tally and are in the handwriting of one and the same
person i.e. PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha.
377\. In his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, Gopalji has pleaded that one
document D-74, is shown to have been recovered from his house bears the date
as 24.05.1975, whereas the search was carried out 17.05.1975. I have perused
the document D-74, which is available in Folder R-5 and it does not bear the
signatures of the search witnesses Sh. Parsu Ram Singh (PW-91) and Neel Mohan
Singh and IO/Search Officer PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha. This is a slip of
Rs.200/- for GOLI (cartridges) and bears the signatures of Parmanand Singh and
Bhujangi Prasad (sic.). It has come in the testimony of PW-91 and PW-134 that
all the documents at the time of search were signed by both the search
witnesses and by the search officer PW-134. This document was never confronted
to PW-91 or to PW-134 that it was recovered during the search at the house of
Gopalji at Chautham on 17.05.1975. The record reveal that as per the list of
documents dated 10.11.1975 (Annexure "A"), which was filed along with the
charge sheet, D-74 is described as a slip recovered from the house of Krishan
Kumar Verma of Parsha (Monghyer) bearing script in Hindi for having paid
Rs.200/- for cartridges. Thus, the accused Gopalji has not only confused
himself but is also trying to mislead and confound this court.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 482
378\. The accused Gopalji has left no stone unturned in taking false defence
at every stage during the trial. The accused Gopalji in his bail application
has given his address as that of Village Chautham. I have already referred the
statement of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-91 and in their cross-examination, defence has
never suggested that Gopalji is not a resident of Chautham and he had no
farmhouse at Tilihar or that search was not carried out at Chautham or that he
was not arrested from Chautham but from Patna. Accused persons have also not
claimed so in the cross-examination of PW-134 except that accused Gopalji is a
resident of Village Burail and it was not suggested to him that he had not
been residing at Village Chautham or that he was not arrested from Chautham
after carrying out search there. The statement of Gopalji was recorded under
Section 313 Cr. PC on various dates from 16.11.1998 to 02.11.2001 and in this
statement, he claimed to be a resident of Village Chautham. He did not claim
that search was not carried out at his house at Chautham or that he was not
arrested from there. Moreover, this court has individually appreciated the
deposition of all the witnesses examined by Gopalji on the issue, who have not
been found to be trustworthy at all. In view of these, the answers given by
Gopalji to the questions put to him in his further statement recorded under
Section 313 Cr. PC by this court and explanation put forth by him on
13.01.2012 is nothing but an unsuccessful attempt to explain falsity and not
the truth. It is a well settled law that in a case if an accused adduces false
evidences in respect of his defence, this can CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 483 be taken as
an additional link in the chain in circumstances against him. This has been so
held recently by the Division Bench of our own Hon'ble High Court in Rakesh
Kumar Vs. State (Delhi (6) RCR (CR) 2364).
379\. In view of the above evidence forthcoming against the accused from the
cogent testimonies of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-91, one can safely say that Gopalji
has been a resident of Village Chautham and he also had his farmhouse at
Tilihar across River Kosi. A search was carried at his Chautham House by
PW-134 in the presence of witnesses including PW-91 and search memo Ex.PW-91/A
was prepared by PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha and several documents and articles
were recovered from his house and he was arrested from his house at Chautham.
Evidence also reveals that meetings of members of Revolutionary Group used to
be held at the house at Chautham and farmhouse at Tilihar and arms and
ammunitions used to be collected at his house at Chautham. These meetings used
to take place at the house of Gopalji at Chautham, attended by PW-2,
Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Gopalji and Arteshanand.
34) Effect of leaving Conspiracy by PW-1 & statement of PW-1 & 2 after their
arrest.
380\. The Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the accomplice/approver PW-1 had
left the conspiracy in the month of February 1974 and that the other approver
PW-2 was arrested subsequent to killing of Sh. L.N. Mishra and under Section
10 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 484 their respective
statements are not at all binding on the accused persons facing the trial. In
support of their contentions, they have relied upon judgment of the Privy
Council in Mirza Akbar v. King Emperor AIR 1940 PC 176 and of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in State through Superintendent of Police v. Nalini & Ors. AIR
1999 SC 2640, Mohd. Khalid v. State of West Bengal (6) (2002) 7 SCC 334, State
(NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru AIR 2005 SC 3820 and Kehar Singh
v. State (Delhi Administration) AIR 1988 SC 1883. They have also referred the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Gujarat v. Mohammed Atik &
Ors. Crl. A. Nos. 400-403 of 1998 decided on 3.4.1998. With due respect, there
is no dispute about principles of law laid down by the Privy Council and
Hon'ble Supreme in these judgments.
381\. Since the Charge has been framed under Section 120-B of Indian Penal
Code against the accused persons, I would like to advert to the law of
conspiracy, its definition, essential features, ingredients to the offence and
case law.
382\. Section 120-A IPC defines "criminal" conspiracy which reads as under: -
> "120-A. Definition of criminal conspiracy- When two or more persons agree to
> do, or cause to be done,-
> (1) an illegal act, or CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
> December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 485 (2) an act which is not illegal
> by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:
> Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall
> amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is
> done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.
> Explanation:- It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate
> object of such agreement, or is merely incidental to that object."
383\. It is clear from the above noted definition of "criminal conspiracy"
that the three essential elements of offence of conspiracy are: -
> (a) a criminal object, which may be either the ultimate aim of the
> agreement, or may constitute the means, or one of the means by which that
> aim is to be accomplished;
> (b) a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object;
(c) an agreement or understanding between two or more of the accused persons
whereby they become definitely committed to co-operate for the accomplishment
of the object by the means CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 486 embodied in the agreement,
or by any effectual means.
Thus, the gist of offence of criminal conspiracy is an agreement to break the
law.
384\. Under Section 120-A of the Indian Penal Code when two or more persons
agree to do, or cause to be done, (a) an illegal act; or (b) an act, which is
not illegal by illegal means, such agreement is designated a criminal
conspiracy. The essence of offence of conspiracy is the fact of combination by
agreement. The agreement may be express or implied, or in part express and in
part implied. The conspiracy arises and the offence is committed as soon as
the agreement is made; and the offence continues to be committed so long as
the combination persists, that is until the conspiratorial agreement is
terminated by completion of its performance or by abandonment or frustration.
The gist of offence of conspiracy is an agreement to break the law. Conspiracy
is hatched in secrecy and as such direct evidence is seldom available. So, in
case of criminal conspiracy, the court has to infer certain facts and
circumstances. In considering the question of criminal conspiracy, it is not
always possible to give affirmative evidence about the date of formation of
conspiracy, about the persons who took part in the formation of conspiracy,
about the object which the conspirators set before themselves as the object of
conspiracy and about the manner in which the object of conspiracy was to be
carried out. All this is necessarily a matter of inference. Agreement of CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 487 conspiracy can be proved either by direct evidence or
by circumstantial evidence or by both. It is not necessary that there should
be express proof of the agreement, far from the acts and conduct of the
parties, the agreement can be inferred.
385\. Proof of a criminal conspiracy by direct evidence is not easy to get and
probably for this reason Section 10 of the Indian Evidence Act was enacted. It
reads as under:-
> "10. Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common design :-
> Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have
> conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything
> said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their
> common intention, after the time when such intention was first entertained
> by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons
> believed to so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence
> of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a
> party to it."
386\. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohammad Usman Mohammad
Hassan Maniyar Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981 SC 1062, that for an offence
u/s. 120-B IPC, the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 488 prosecution need not necessarily
prove that the perpetrator expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the
illegal act, the agreement may be proved by necessary implications. Further,
it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme court in Ram Narayan Poply Vs. Central
Bureau of Investigation, AIR 2003, SC 2748 that, "the essential ingredient of
the offence of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an offence.
In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself
constitutes an offence, then in that event no overt act is necessary to be
proved by the prosecution because in such a situation, criminal conspiracy is
established by proving such an agreement. Where the conspiracy alleged is with
regard to commission of a serious crime of the nature as contemplated in
Section 120-B read with the proviso to sub section (2) of Section 120-A, then
in that event mere proof of an agreement between the accused for commission of
such a crime alone is enough to bring about a conviction under Section 120-B
and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any one of them would not
be necessary. The provisions, in such a situation, do not require that each
and every person who is a CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 489 party to the conspiracy must do
some overt act towards the fulfillment of the object of conspiracy, the
essential ingredient being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the
crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established, the act would
fall within the trapping of the provisions contained in Section 120-B.
Privacy and secrecy are more characteristics of a conspiracy, than of a loud
discussion in an elevated place open to public view. Direct evidence in proof
of conspiracy is seldom available; offence of conspiracy can be proved by
either direct or substantial evidence. It is not always possible to give
affirmative evidence about date of formation of criminal conspiracy, about the
persons who took part in formation of conspiracy, about the object, which the
objectors set before themselves as the object of conspiracy and about the
manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be carried out; all this is
necessarily a matter of inference."
387\. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Firozuddin Basheeruddin
versus State of Kerala, 2001 (4) Recent Criminal Report 20, that the criminal
conspiracy can be proved by CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 490 circumstantial evidence and
even if some steps are resorted to by one or two of the conspirators without
the knowledge of the others it will not affect the culpability of those others
when they are associated with the object of the conspiracy. It is also held
that conspiracy is hatched in private or in secrecy. It is rarely possible to
establish conspiracy by direct evidence and usually both the existence of the
conspiracy and its object has to be inferred from the circumstances and
conduct of the accused. When two or more persons agree to commit crime of
conspiracy, then regardless of making or considering any plans for its
commission, and despite the fact that no step is taken by such persons to
carry out their common purposes, a crime is committed by each and every one
who joins in the agreement. A criminal conspiracy is a partnership in crime
and that there is in each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the
prosecution of a common plan. Thus, if two or more persons enter into a
conspiracy, any act done by any of them pursuant to the agreement is, in
contemplation of law, the act of each of them and they are jointly responsible
thereof. It was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of H.P. Vs. Krishan
Lal Pradhan, AIR 1987 SC 773 that every one of the conspirators need not take
active part in the commission of each and every one of the conspiratorial
acts.
388\. This section came for interpretation before Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Shiva Narayana v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1980 Supreme Court 449 wherein it
was held that under the principle CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 491 contained in Section 10
of the Evidence Act, once a conspiracy to commit an illegal act is proved, act
of one of the conspirator becomes the act of the other.
389\. The consolidated case law as on date has been succinctly summarized by
the Division Bench of our Hon'ble High Court of Delhi recently in a celebrated
judgment by his lordship Hon'ble Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, while writing
for the Bench in Rakesh Kumar & Ors. Versus State, 2009 (163) DLT 658, as
under: -
> "134. After survey of the case law on the point, following legal principles
> pertaining to the law of conspiracy can be conveniently culled out:-
A. When two or more persons agree to commit a crime of conspiracy, then
regardless of making or considering any plans for its commission, and despite
the fact that no step is taken by any such person to carry out their common
purpose, a crime is committed by each and every one who joins in the
agreement. There has thus to be two conspirators and there may be more than
that. To prove the charge of conspiracy it is not necessary that intended
crime was committed or not. If committed it may further help prosecution to
prove the charge of conspiracy. (See the decision of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 492
Supreme Court reported as State v. Nalini, (1999) 5 SCC 253).
B. The very agreement, concert or league is the ingredient of the offence. It
is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of
the conspiracy as long as they are co-
participators in the main object of the conspiracy. It is not necessary that
all conspirators should agree to the common purpose at the same time.
They may join with other conspirators at any time before the consummation of
the intended objective, and all are equally responsible. What part each
conspirator is to play may not be known to everyone or the fact as to when a
conspirator joined the conspiracy and when he left. There may be so many
devices and techniques adopted to achieve the common goal of the conspiracy
and there may be division of performances in the chain of actions with one
object to achieve the real end of which every collaborator must be aware and
in which each one of them must be interested. There must be unity of object or
purpose but there may be plurality of means sometimes even unknown to one
another, amongst the conspirators. In CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 493 achieving the
goal several offences may be committed by some of the conspirators even
unknown to the others. The only relevant factor is that all means adopted and
illegal acts done must be and purported to be in furtherance of the object of
the conspiracy even though there may be sometimes misfire or overshooting by
some of the conspirators. Even if some steps are resorted to by one or two of
the conspirators without the knowledge of the others it will not affect the
culpability of those others when they are associated with the object of the
conspiracy. But then there has to be present mutual interest.
Persons may be members of single conspiracy even though each is ignorant of
the identity of many others who may have diverse role to play. It is not a
part of the crime of conspiracy that all the conspirators need to agree to
play the same or an active role. (See the decisions of Supreme Court reported
as Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab, AIR 1977 Supreme Court 2433 and State
v.
Nalini, (Supra)] C. It is the unlawful agreement and not its accomplishment,
which is the gist or essence of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 494 crime of
conspiracy. Offence of criminal conspiracy is complete even though there is no
agreement as to the means by which the purpose is to be accomplished. It is
the unlawful agreement, which is the graham of the crime of conspiracy.
D. The unlawful agreement which amounts to a conspiracy need not be formal or
express, but may be inherent in and inferred from the circumstances,
especially declarations, acts, and conduct of the conspirators. The agreement
need not be entered into by all the parties to it at the same time, but may be
reached by successive actions evidencing their joining of the conspiracy.
Since a conspiracy is generally hatched in secrecy, it would quite often
happen that there is no evidence of any express agreement between the
conspirators to do or cause to be done the illegal act. For an offence under
Section 120-B, the prosecution need not necessarily prove that the
perpetrators expressly agreed to do or cause to be done the illegal act; the
agreement may be proved by necessary implication. The offence can be only
proved largely from the inference drawn from acts or illegal omission
committed by the conspirators in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 495 pursuance of a common
design. The prosecution will also more often rely upon circumstantial
evidence. It is not necessary to prove actual meeting of conspirators. Nor it
is necessary to prove the actual words of communication. The evidence as to
transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design is sufficient.
Surrounding circumstances and antecedent and subsequent conduct of accused
persons constitute relevant material to prove charge of conspiracy. (See the
decisions of Supreme Court reported as Shivnarayan Laxminarayan Joshi v. State
of Maharashtra, AIR 1980 Supreme Court 439;
Mohammad Usman Mohammad Hussain Maniyar v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981
Supreme Court 1062; and Kehar Singh v. State AIR 1988 Supreme Court 1883) E. A
conspiracy is a continuing offence and continues to subsist and committed
wherever one of the conspirators does an act or series of acts. So long as its
performance continues, it is a continuing offence till it is executed or
rescinded or frustrated by choice or necessity. A crime is complete as soon as
the agreement is made, but it CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 496 is not a thing of the
moment. It does not end with the making of the agreement. It will continue so
long as there are two or more parties to it intending to carry into effect the
design. Its continuance is a threat to the society against which it was aimed
at and would be dealt with as soon as that jurisdiction can properly claim the
power to do so. The conspiracy designed or agreed abroad will have the same
effect as in India, when part of the acts, pursuant to the agreement are
agreed to be finalized or done, attempted or even frustrated and vice versa.
F. Section 10 of the Evidence Act introduces the doctrine of agency and if the
conditions laid down therein are satisfied, the acts done by one are
admissible against the coconspirators. In short, the section can be analysed
as follows:-
(1) There shall be a prima facie evidence affording a reasonable ground for a
Court to believe that two or more persons are members of a conspiracy; (2) if
the said condition is fulfilled, anything said, done or written by any one of
them in reference to their common intention will be evidence against the
other; (3) anything said, done or written by him CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 497 should
have been said, done or written by him after the intention was formed by any
one of them; (4) it would also be relevant for the said purpose against
another who entered the conspiracy whether it was said, done or written before
he Crl.A.19, 51, 121, 139, 144 & 65/2007 Page 81 of 183 entered the conspiracy
or after he left it; and (5) it can only be used against a co-conspirator and
not in his favour. (See the decision of Supreme Court reported as Sardar
Sardul Singh v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1957 Supreme Court 747.)"
390\. Here it is pertinent to refer to a classic judgment of three Hon'ble
Judges' Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhagwan Swarup v. State of
Maharashtra, AIR 1965 SC 682 (known as 2 nd Caveeshar case) in which his
lordship Hon'ble Mr. Justice Subba Rao, had already spoken for the bench
analysed the ingredients of Section 10 as culled out above in the judgment of
our Hon'ble High Court in Rakesh Kumar (supra), which amounts to repetition,
if quoted again.
391\. It would be profitable to draw reliance from yet another judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of the same strength (Three Hon'ble Judges) in Nalini
case (supra) relied upon by the defence, which reads "It is not that
immediately the object of conspiracy is achieved, Section 10 becomes
inapplicable. For example principle CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 498 like that of res
gestae as contained in Section 6 of the Evidence Act will continue to apply."
(Para 582). Therefore, the res gestae i.e. the acts, circumstances and the
statements that are incidental to the principal fact of a litigated matter and
are admissible in evidence in view of their relevant association with that
fact, cannot be ignored since the same become relevant in view of Section 6 of
the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Thus, this court is constrained to appreciate
the attendant circumstances and the facts thereon, which are connected with
the facts in issue i.e. the conspiracy to find out whether the acts amounted
to conspiracy or not. It was argued by Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate for the
defence that PW-1 has snapped out of the conspiracy in February, 1974 and he
was arrested on 29.07.1975 and other approver PW-2 Vikram was arrested on
12.08.1975, after killing of L.N. Mishra, the other accused persons facing the
trial are not bound by the statement made by both of them in view of the law
cited by her.
392\. In fact, the case law is misconceived in applying to the facts in issue
by the learned Defence Counsel. It is relevant to quote that even if the PW-1
has left the conspiracy in February 1974, his actions pursuant to the
conspiracy till he stepped out of it becomes res gestae, which cannot be
ignored. The intentions and motive of the criminal conspiracy hatched in
October, 1973 is kept alive since the object of conspiracy is to have the cult
head Anand Murti released from jail either by hook or crook (whether lawful
and unlawful means by terrorizing the State). Merely by achieving the slaying
of some of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 499 targets like L.N. Mishra, did not
terminate the object of the conspiracy by the conceivers of the same and the
accused facing the trial. This court is unable to assimilate the submissions
of the Ld. Defence Counsel that the statement of PW-1 and PW-2 after the
murder of L.N. Mishra shall not bind the accused persons facing the trial in
view of law of agency implied under Section 10 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
It is worthwhile to rely on the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhagwan Swarup
(supra) and of our Hon'ble High Court in Rakesh Kumar (supra), which reads
"(4) It would also be relevant for the said purpose against another who
entered the conspiracy whether it was said, done or written before he entered
the conspiracy or after he left it; and (5) it can only be used against a co-
conspirator and not in his favour." Reason being, the law of res gestae as
contained in Section 6 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
393\. Further, the statement of both the approvers PW-1 and PW-2 stands in a
different pedestal. These witnesses have withstood extensive cross-examination
at the hands of the accused. This is not a mere case based on the statement of
a conspirator against the co- conspirator. Here two conspirators have turned
approvers. Thus, their testimony is on par with an eye witness and also as an
accomplice. In such circumstance, their testimonies are to be carefully
scrutinized and the same is to be tested on the touchstone of corroboration in
material particulars as laid down in several rulings, which I have already
discussed in the earlier part of the judgment.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 500
394\. The very judgment relied by the accused in Navjot Sandhu's case (supra),
the Hon'ble Supreme Court has made a distinction at Para (xv), which squarely
applies to the present case and the same is as follows: -
> "(xv) The learned senior counsel then referred to the decision of this Court
> in Tribhuwan v. State of Maharashtra [1972(3) SCC 511], in which the accused
> examined himself as a witness and his evidence was admitted under Section 10
> of the Evidence Act, mainly on the ground that his deposition could be
> subjected to cross- examination. So also in the case of K. Hashim v. State
> of Tamil Nadu, the evidence of co-accused who subsequently became approver,
> was admitted under Section 10. These two cases rest on a different principle
> and cannot be said to have differed with the view taken in Mirza Akbar's
> case................"
395\. The judgments relied upon by the Ld. Defence Counsel are distinguishable
for the reason mentioned in the preceding Para. PW-1 and PW-2, parties to the
crime have turned approvers. The competent court had granted them the pardon.
Their statements in proving the acts of their fellowmen cannot be held
sacrosanct unless and until the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 501 attendant circumstances,
the acts and the things done jointly by all are proved and corroborated by
material particulars. Now I venture to proceed to analyze the evidence on
various aspects of the conspiracy hereunder.
35) PW-2 joining Criminal Conspiracy
396\. I have already referred to the reliability of the testimony of PW- 2,
regarding the "Anand Marg, its founder, wings and objects", holding of Rally,
Self-immolations and his association and posting at Jaipur Printing Press of
Anand Marg. It is also proved on record that he returned to Delhi in the last
week of June 1974 and was reporting to Chief Secretary Sh. Dhaneshanand at
D-41, South Extension, Part-1, New Delhi. He worked at Delhi Press, which is
proved on record. I have also earlier referred the further deposition of PW-2
about his meeting with A-1 in the market at South Extension, Part-1 at the end
of June 1974, incognito and wearing a hearing aid. The version of PW-2 that he
was called by A-1 at the gate of IARI, Pusa Road, Delhi and his visits, the
PW-2 discarding the saffron robes, assuming pseudonym, carrying a letter and
packet given by A-1 to be delivered to Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur has
already been duly corroborated and proved in material particulars. It is to be
mentioned that PW-2 was exhorted and influenced by A-1 to work underground by
joining a Group of devotees/monks to achieve the object discussed above by
means of violent methods. He knew Budheshawaranand, whose other name was
Tyageshwaranand and Amar Singh, whose CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 502 original name was
Surya Prakash, hailing from District Unnao, U.P. Santoshanand told him that
Sudevanand had changed his name as Ram Chander and Bharat.
397\. PW-2 clearly testified that A-1 gave him one packet duly packed and one
letter in a closed envelope for delivery to Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur. A-1
advised him that whereabouts of Budheshawaranand should be enquired from the
Principal of Anand Marg Primary School, Bhagalpur. He testified that the
packet and the letter were given to him by A-1 at about 03.00 or 04.00 PM near
PUSA Institute in the presence of PW-13 for its delivery to Budheshawaranand
at Bhagalpur. On the same day, he left for Bhagalpur along with the packet and
the letter, reached Bhagalpur by train at 1 O'clock at night. He stayed at the
platform during night. The next morning, he went to Anand Marg Primary School,
where he met Chitbhashanand, Principal of the School and on his request,
Budheshawaranand was called there. Previously Budheshawaranand used to clad
himself like an Avadhoot but on that day, he was seen in plain clothes with
hair cut short and beard shaved. He (PW-2) gave him that packet and letter.
Budheshawaranand kept the packet in a thaila (bag), which was opened and
closed by a zip. Sh. Sukhdev Sahu (PW-15) had rented a room where
Budheshawaranand was living with him. He stayed in that room for 8/10 days and
after 1 or 2 days, Budheshawaranand brought him to Chautham at the house of
Gopalji and met him. He (PW-2) correctly identified Gopalji in the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 503 court by pointing towards him. He did not know him (Gopalji)
prior to that. At a distance of 5 or 7 KMs, Gopalji had a farmhouse at Tilihar
and Budheshawaranand introduced Gopalji and PW-2 as a confident members of
Revolutionary Group and informed A-7 that PW-2 had been sent there by A-1. He
stayed at Chautham for one day and then he came back to Bhagalpur with
Budheshawaranand. He deposed that Budheshawaranand told him that in case of
any emergency, he could come to Gopalji for help. He stayed at Bhagalpur for
one or two days after his return from Chautham.
398\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 answered that he had not stated before
ACMM in his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC that at that time when he met
him in the market of South Extension Part-1, A-1 was sporting short moustaches
and hair and that he was wearing hearing aid. He clarified that he had
mentioned that he was in plain clothes. He replied that A-1 told that there
should be armed revolution and when he was confronted with his previous
statement before the Magistrate under Section 164 Cr. PC, the word used are
"Kranti" and not "Shashastra Kranti". He had stated before the Magistrate in
his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC that A-1 gave him a packet and a
letter, but he has not stated that the packet was duly packed and the envelope
was closed. The packet was wrapped in a cloth piece and it appeared that there
were papers underneath the cloth cover. He replied that he had mentioned the
name of the Principal of Anand Marg Primary School, Bhagalpur in his statement
Ex.PW-2/L, but when he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 504 was confronted with his previous
statement, the name of the Principal was not found recorded. He had not stated
in Ex.PW-2/L that Budheshawaranand had his haircut short and beard shaved and
that he was in plain clothes. He deposed that it was 12.00 Noon or 01.00 PM,
when Budheshawaranand met him in the school premises at Bhagalpur and at that
time, he handed over the letter and packet to Budheshawaranand. It was 3rd or
4th of July 1974, when Budheshawaranand met him in the Primary School,
Bhagalpur. He has not stated before the Magistrate that Sukhdev Sahu had
rented a room, in which Budheshawaranand was living or that he had stayed in
his room for 8/10 days. In his previous statement, it was found recorded that
he lived with Budheshawaranand. He had not stated before the Magistrate that
he was introduced to Gopalji by Budheshawaranand as a confident and devoted
member of Revolutionary Group. When confronted with statement Ex.PW-2/L, it
was found mentioned that he was introduced with Gopalji. In his further cross-
examination, PW-2 deposed that he did not remember the room number of Shiv Raj
Singh (PW-13).
399\. The testimony of PW-2 that he went to meet A-1 in IARI, Pusa, New Delhi,
where A-1 handed over him a letter and packet to be delivered to
Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur and that he got his beard shaved and hair short
cut is corroborated by PW-13. I have already discussed the introductory
deposition of PW-13 about his shifting to Delhi in September 1972, his stay in
the hostel room of IARI, Pusa up CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 505 to 29.5.1975, working of
Santoshanand as Editor of 'Prout' at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi, his
visit while A-1 used to be in the saffron attire and appearance of Anand Margi
and his participation in the Boat Club Rally at the instance of A-1. I have
also referred his statement that after self-immolation by Dineshwaranand, A-1
stopped coming to him. It is found in the testimony of PW-13 that A-1 came to
him in April 1974, but was not wearing uniform of Avadhoot and he was not
sporting beard and mustaches and having his haircut. He was in plain clothes
wearing pant & shirt. A-1 told him that Government was harassing Baba who
could not be released by adopting constitutional means. A-1 informed him that
some violent means should be adopted to get the Baba released and he was asked
by A-1 to co-operate with him to achieve that object. However, PW-13 declined
as he was a family man and a Government servant. A-1 asked him that he should
collect arms & ammunitions but he did not agree. Sometimes A-1 used to stay
with him in his room. A-1 came to him in the first week of July 1974 and
stayed with him for the whole night and the next day he along with A-1 went to
PUSA gate where one person met them and A-1 introduced him as Vikram. He would
be in a position to identify Vikram. (The witness has correctly identified
approver Vikram in the Court). PW-13 further deposed that at that time Vikram
was also having long hair sporting beard and mustaches. They all three went to
the Hostel. Thereafter, he (PW-13) went to the laboratory leaving A-1 and
Vikram talking to each other there on one CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 506 side of the room.
He returned to the Hostel at 3.00 or 4.00 PM and found both A-1 and PW-2
inside his room but he found PW-2 having his haircut short and not having
beard. He found PW-2 having short mustaches. A-1 gave one packet with one
letter to PW-2 with a direction to give the same to Aacharya Budheshawaranand
at Bhagalpur. PW-2 left his room at about 5.00 PM.
400\. In his cross-examination, PW-13 answered that when A-1 visited him in
1974, he did not inquire from A-1 as to why he had changed his attire. He did
not remember the exact date of July 1974 when A-1 came to him but he came to
him in the first week of July 1974\. He did not ask A-1 where he was posted
and what was his source of livelihood was during the last one year. He did not
inquire from him whether he was trying to collect arms and ammunitions.
401\. I have minutely perused the deposition of PW-13 and found that his
testimony on the aforesaid points testified by him in his examination-in-chief
have not been shattered by the accused persons including A-1. The defence was
unsuccessful in shattering the deposition of PW-13 about the visit of A-1 or
that of PW-2 in the first week of July 1974 in the Hostel room of PW-13. The
defence has also not derided that he left for his laboratory leaving A-1
having conversation with PW-2 or his return there at 03.00 or 04.00 PM, when
A-1 in his presence handed over one packet with a letter in the envelope for
delivery to Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur. Therefore, CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 507
the testimony of PW-2 has been corroborated by the version of PW-
13\. As this witness has no axe to grind against the accused and further being
an independent person employed by the government, but a sympathizer of the
cult, his testimony is found cogent and trustworthy.
36) Pamphlets of Revolutionary Message.
402\. PW-2 further testified that on his visit to Bhagalpur, he accompanied
Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh to Baidyanath Printing Press there.
Budheshawaranand had already got published pamphlets in the name of Shashastra
Krantikari Chhatra Sangh and they read some pamphlets, which looked alike
Ex.PW-2/D (available in the Folder R-4). They went to that press to get such
like pamphlets printed and Press owner demanded advance for printing but
Budheshawaranand was not having sufficient amount, so they came back to the
house of Sh. Sukhdev Sahu (PW-15). He identified the photograph of the
Budheshawaranand Ex.P-3 (available in the Folder R-4) and deposed that
Budheshawaranand has died. In his cross- examination, he answered that he had
not stated in his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC, that Budheshawaranand
had taken him to Baidyanath Printing Press at Bhagalpur or that they were not
possessed of sufficient amount or that they came to the house of Sukhdev Sahu.
403\. This fact is corroborated by the statement of PW-36 Sh. Baidyanath
Parsad Sinha, who deposed that he owned Baijnath Press CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 508
at Mundi Chakk, Bhagalpur, which he and his father used to supervise. In the
middle of June 1974, 2 or 3 persons came to his press and one of them gave his
name as Amar Singh and they wanted to get a pamphlet printed from his press.
They brought the manuscript of the pamphlet and wanted that press line should
not appear on the pamphlet. They also desired that no entry in their record of
printing the pamphlet should be made and pamphlet should be printed
immediately. They were given threat that they would be make it difficult for
them to run the press and would set it on fire unless they agreed.
Accordingly, he agreed and in those days, Chhatra Aandolan (student agitation)
was going on and he agreed for printing of pamphlets because of Chhatra
Aandolan and due to threat given to him. A proof Ex.PW-2/D was prepared and
next day, same persons came to him and he gave two sheets of proof Ex.PW-2/D
(2 sheets) to Amar Singh, who made some corrections in his presence at point
A, B & C. The writing at point D & D1 on Ex.PW-2/D was also made by Amar Singh
in his presence and Rs.100/- were paid to him for printing of 2,000 copies of
pamphlets and Amar Singh also made writing at point 'E' on Ex.PW-2/D in his
presence regarding payment of the amount and then they printed 2,000 copies of
pamphlets. In 2nd week of July 1974, Amar Singh again came to him with one boy
and he would be in a position to identify Amar Singh, and his photograph.
Ex.P-3 has been identified by the witness as photograph of Amar Singh. In
August 1975, CBI men seized the proof of the pamphlet CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 509
Ex.PW-2/D and final copy of the pamphlet (2 sheets) Ex.PW-36/A vide Seizure
Memo Ex.PW36/B. (Ex.PW-36/A consisting of two sheets is available in Folder
R-13. Seizure Memo Ex.PW-36/B is available in Folder R-2).
404\. In his cross-examination, PW-36 replied that writing at point 'E' on
Ex.PW-2/D was made by Amar Singh on the date written therein and on that very
date, Amar Singh saw the proof. He deposed that Amar Singh did not put the
date, when he put his signature in Hindi, however, he had given the date under
his signature at the time of making the payment. It is further elicited that
Amar Singh was aged about 25 years. He was accompanied by one or two persons
on his first visit to his press. One of them was of fair colour and other was
of blackish complexion. CBI officer had shown him five or six photographs and
he identified the photograph of Amar Singh. There was slight difference
between the photograph Ex.P-3 and the photograph shown to him and explained
that there was difference of size. He has denied the suggestion that he is an
agent of CBI or that no person by name Amar Singh came to him in the press or
that he did not own any press or that Amar Singh did not make any corrections
in Ex.PW-2/D in his presence or that he has deposed falsely.
405\. After going through the deposition of PW-36, I find that the defence
could not discredit his testimony. Rather the defence has fortified the
deposition of the PW-2 and PW-36 about the visit to the CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 510
press. The defence failed to belie that Ex.P-3 was not the photograph of Amar
Singh. PW-36 is an independent person. The accused persons have not shown any
enmity with him. The accused persons also could not discredit the witness that
the pamphlet Ex.PW-36/A was published from his press after the proof Ex.PW-2/D
with corrections thereon was delivered to him by Amar Singh. It has already
come in evidence that Amar Singh was also known as Budheshawaranand and
Tyageshwaranand and his photograph has been identified by PW-2. The owner of
the printing press PW-36 has also identified this photograph Ex.P-3 to be of
Amar Singh, who had visited his press. This photograph has also been admitted
by the defence while giving suggestion to the main IO Sh. H.L. Ahuja (PW-
151). The prosecution has examined PW-36 only to corroborate the testimony of
approver PW-2 Vikram, who accompanied Amar Singh to the said press of PW-36,
while at Bhagalpur to get printed the pamphlets.
406\. PW-131 Sh. M.P. Singh, Deputy SP, CBI testified that he has been
associated with the investigation of this case from 8.1.1975 to 29.8.1976
while assisting Investigation Officer Sh. H.L. Ahuja, Dy. SP. He deposed that
on the direction of Chief I.O. (Sh. Ahuja), on 23.8.1975, he went to Bhagalpur
and met Sh. Baidyanath Sinha (PW-
36) of Baidyanath Printing Press and seized one copy of proof Ex.PW- 2/D (2
sheets) and pamphlet (2 sheets) Ex.PW-36/A vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-36/B.
Ex.PW-2/D is the proof of pamphlet with the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 511 title
Shashastra Kranti- Hamara Rasta and this has been edited at points A, B & C
and signed by one Amar Singh at point Q-11 and Q-
12\. (This document is available in the Folder R-4).
407\. In his cross-examination, PW-131 answered that the pamphlets, which were
given to him by the Chief IO, did not have the print line. The Chief IO
instructed him to ascertain that the pamphlets were printed at the Baidyanath
Printing Press. He has denied the suggestion that they have bargained with
Baidyanath Sinha (PW-36) that in consideration of his agreeing to make a
statement they would not take any action against him for incriminatory
pamphlets. The owner of the printing press did not produce any document before
him, having received amount for printing the pamphlets. He replied that he was
shown registration certificate of Baidyanath Printing Press and it was in the
name of Avadh Kumar Sinha, who is father of Baidyanath. Shri Avadh Kumar Sinha
was alive, but he did not examine him as he was not available being out of
station. He also did not consider it necessary to contact Sh. Avadh Kumar
Sinha as Amar Singh has contacted PW-36 to get the pamphlets printed. He had
not shown photograph Ex.P-3 to PW-36 and he had a smaller photograph of the
same person along with five or six more photographs, which were shown to
PW-36. The parentage of both the witnesses of Seizure Memo Ex.PW-36/B was not
mentioned. Baidyanath Printing Press is situated at Mundi Chakk and both the
witnesses Subodh Kumar and Anjani Kumar were from Mundi Chakk.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 512
408\. The testimony of PW-131 could not be demolished by the Ld. Defence
Counsel in his extensive cross-examination. They could not demolish that the
pamphlets and proof copy bearing the signature of Amar Singh, were not
recovered from the press owner PW-36.
37) Stay of PW-2, Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh at the house of PW-15.
409\. It has come in the testimony of PW-2 that he delivered the packet and
letter of A-1 to Budheshawaranand at Anand Marg Primary School, Bhagalpur and
that Budheshawaranand was a tenant under Sh. Sukhdev Sahu (PW-15). PW-2 came
with Budheshawaranand to his house and stayed there. To corroborate the
testimony of PW-2, the prosecution has examined Sh. Sukhdev Sahu as PW-15, who
deposed that he was working as a clerk in PWD and took Diksha in the year 1968
from Aacharya Saryug Prasad and joined Anand Marg. He came to Bhagalpur in the
year 1974 on his transfer. He testified that in Bhagalpur, he came in contact
with Aacharya Chitbhashanand Avadhoot of Anand Marg, who was Principal of
Anand Marg Primary School, Bhagalpur. On asking of Aacharya Chitbhashanand,
PW-15 replied that he had no objection for the stay of some persons with him.
Aacharya Chitbhashanand informed him that a person namely Amar Singh, an Anand
Margi, would be visiting him for stay. In the month of June 1974, one person
Amar Singh with reference of Aacharya Chitbhashanand came to him. He deposed
that on 04.7.1974 Amar CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 513 Singh accompanied with another,
who was introduced to him as Subir Kumar. The witness has correctly identified
by pointing towards PW-2 in the Court as Subir (pseudonym of PW-2). Amar Singh
and PW-2 stayed with him and Amar Singh told him that he was to go to
Muzaffarpur and enquired from him whether he knew someone there and requested
for a letter of reference so that he may stay with that person at Muzaffarpur.
He (PW-15) gave him two introductory letters addressed to Sh. Satya Narain
Parsad, his relative and another to Sh. Ram Sagar Parsad, his nephew. They
remained with him up to 12.7.1974 and they left his house in the Morning of
13.7.1974. He identified both letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B, which were
given by him. He also identified the photograph Ex.P-3 as that of Amar Singh.
(Ex.P-3 is the photograph of Tyageshwaranand @ Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh
in plain dress and has also been identified by PW-2). He was also shown the
blackish bag Ex.P-7, which was with Amar Singh on 04.7.1974 and the witness
stated that the bag had a handle in the center, which was not there).
Ex.PW-15/A is a letter dated 04.07.1974 written in Hindi by Sukhdev (PW-15)
addressed to Sh. Satya Narain. On the backside of the letter, the name and
address of Sh. Satya Narain Prasad of Muzaffarpur is mentioned at point A.
Ex.PW-15/B is another letter dated 04.07.1974 addressed to Sh. Ram Sagar
Prasad written in Hindi by Sukhdev (PW-15). On its backside, the name of Sh.
Ram Sagar Pd. is mentioned. Both these CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 514 letters dated
04.07.1974 Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B are available in Folder R-1.
410\. In the cross-examination of PW-15, he admitted the suggestion that afore
said Amar Singh is now dead. He also admitted that police came to him after
the death of Amar Singh. He deposed that until the CBI came to him, he did not
know that the other name of Amar Singh was Budheshawaranand. He referred the
name of "Subir Kumar" in his statement before the police and when his
attention was drawn to his previous statement, his name was found mentioned as
"Subir". He has denied the suggestion that Amar Singh had not stayed with him
in the month of July 1974. He has also denied the suggestion that Vikram did
not stay with him at any time.
411\. Perusal of the deposition of PW-15 put forth he issued above said two
letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B, which are not questioned by the defence.
Even otherwise, the defence except for suggesting that neither Amar Singh nor
Subir Kumar (PW-2) stayed with him, could not discredit the witness in other
detailed facts spoken to by him. The prosecution has mainly examined PW-15 to
corroborate the testimony of the approver PW-2 that pursuant to direction of
accused Santoshanand, he came to Bhagalpur and handed over one letter in
envelope and one packet to Budheshawaranand, who is also known as Amar Singh
and both of them stayed at the house of PW-15. The prosecution has also
examined him for the reason that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 515 these two letters
Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B were issued by PW-15 on the request of Amar Singh to
enable him to stay at Muzaffarpur. They have also examined him for the reason
that these letters Ex.PW- 15/A and Ex.PW-15/B along with hand grenades etc.
were recovered subsequently from the search of the bag Ex.P-7, which was
seized by the police from Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh at Maqbara (Tomb),
Khanjarpur on 13.07.1974. Regarding this incident an FIR No. 71 of 13.7.1974
of PS Kotwali, Bhagalpur was registered. PW-2 was accompanying
Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh at the Maqbara at that time, which incident now
I propose to deal in the succeeding caption.
38) Incident at Maqbara, Khanjarpur.
412\. It is the case of the prosecution that pursuant to the criminal
conspiracy, arms and ammunitions was collected by the accused persons and in
the first week of July 1974, A-1 handed over one letter and a packet to PW-2
to be delivered at Bhagalpur to Budheshawaranand. After delivering the packet
and the letter, PW-2 accompanied Budheshawaranand to his rented
accommodation/room in the house of PW-15. There on 04.07.1974, on the request
of Amar Singh @ Budheshawaranand, PW-15 issued him two letters Ex.PW- 15/A and
Ex.PW-15/B. In their further attempt in pursuance to the criminal conspiracy,
PW-2 accompanied Budheshawaranand at Maqbara, Khanjarpur on 13.07.1974 and at
that time, Budheshawaranand was carrying a bag Ex.P-7. In this regard, PW-2
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 516 further testified that there is a tomb near Anand
Marg Primary School, Bhagalpur in the area known as Chhotti Khanjarpur. On
13.7.1974 at about 10/11 AM, he and Budheshawaranand were present at the
Maqbara (Tomb). Budheshawaranand had the thaila (bag) with him in which he was
carrying that packet. Some tourists were taking snaps there and in the
meanwhile, police came there and arrested Budheshawaranand. He threw his bag
i.e. thaila towards PW-2. PW- 2 tried to pick up the thaila and police officer
also tried to catch him. However, he (PW-2) ran away leaving thaila there.
(During his deposition, a sealed envelope was opened, which was found to
contain that bag Ex.P-7. The bag was found empty). The bag, which
Budheshawaranand was carrying and dropped, was of same type as Ex.P-7.
413\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 replied that he did not state in his
previous statement Ex.PW-2/L that when they went to Maqbara the packet was in
the thaila, which Budheshawaranand was carrying since such details were not
asked from him. He answered that it was 13.07.1974, when they went to Maqbara
at 10.00 or 11.00 AM. At that time, 5 or 7 tourists were there for
sightseeing. He could not say how many police officers chased him, as he did
not turn his face backwards. That Maqbara is at the banks of Ganga near the
school. The police officer, who had chased him, was exhorting to catch PW-2,
who in a hurry jumped into the river and escaped by swimming. The police did
not follow him thereafter.

414\. PW-24 Constable Shiv Balak Singh deposed that in the year 1974, he was
working as a Constable at Brari Thana where S.I. Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) was
the Incharge. On 13.7.1974 at about 10.30 AM, he was standing at the Chowk of
Chhotti Khanjarpur and S.I. Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) took him to Maqbara in
Chhotti Khanjarpur. On the way to Maqbara, Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) told him
that some outsiders have come there and they went to Maqbara and found two
persons talking to each other. S.I. Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) made enquiry from
them and one of them was having a leather bag. Darogaji (S.I.) made enquiry
from one of them about the contents of leather bag. At that time, his
companion moved 5/6 paces from there. The person, who was having leather bag,
threw it to his companion, the bag fell down on the ground, and the man
towards whom that bag was thrown started running without that bag. The man,
who had thrown it, then lifted the leather bag and Darogaji secured the man
with the leather bag. He (PW-24) chased his companion but could not succeed in
apprehending that person. (However, this witness had identified that person in
the court by pointing out towards Vikram, approver). Darogaji raised the alarm
upon which two persons namely Sh. Kishan Dass (PW-42) and Mahender came there.
He deposed that Sh. Kishan Dass (PW42) is the Mahant (Priest) of Thakur Dwara
(Temple of Lord Krishna) near the Maqbara. The bag, on opening, was found to
contain three hand grenades, two detonators and one loaded pistol with two
live cartridges. A Seizure Memo was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 518 prepared, seven
papers were found in that bag, and Darogaji signed on all those papers.
(During deposition of PW-24, two sealed parcels with the seal of Explosive
Inspector, Calcutta, were opened and the same were found to contain three hand
grenades, having pins and lever Ex.P-11, Ex.P-12 and Ex.P-13. On opening of
another sealed parcel, it was found to contain Revolver Ex.P-14, two
cartridges Ex.P-15 and Ex.P-16 and these were the same, which were taken out
from that bag.) He would be in a position to identify the photograph of the
man, who was apprehended and Ex.P-3 is the photograph of that person. He also
identified the Bag Ex.P-7, which was with that man whose photograph is Ex.P-3.
He stated that the person, whose photograph is Ex.P-3, is dead and that
person, whose photograph is Ex.P-3, gave his name as Suresh Singh, again as
Ramesh Singh and again as Suraj Prakaksh and that person was taken to P.S.
Brari.
415\. In his cross-examination, PW-24 answered that he had seen the person who
escaped from Maqbara in Police Station Kotwali about one year and few days
after incident. He replied that Maqbara is about 18 feet in height. This is
visible from the road of Brari. Sometimes, he had seen some children on the
roof of Maqbara from the Western side road of Brari Chowk, Khanjarpur. He and
SI Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) had gone upstairs on Maqbara. The roof of that
Maqbara might be 75' X 75' and there are four domes on that Maqbara. They were
in uniform. The width of the stairs might be about two feet. He (PW-24)
started chasing the person, who was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 519 running towards
East and that person has run away using the stairs. He could not apprehend
him. There was no electricity in the stairs. He had given the description of
that person escaped to Darogaji. In his further cross-examination, he deposed
that they had not given any beating to the person, who was apprehended by them
at the Maqbara. He has denied the suggestion that they had given him beatings
and the person became unable to speak. He deposed that the person secured by
them along with the bag containing the said articles, received minor injuries
on his shoulder in the process of apprehending him. There was no bleeding.
They remained at the spot till 02.00 PM. No cash was recovered from the
personal search of the person secured.
416\. Perusal of the testimony of PW-24 reflect that his deposition about
recovery of aforesaid Bag Ex.P-7 containing three hand grenades, one pistol
with two cartridges etc. from the person of Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh has
not been belied. His testimony identifying PW-2 Vikram and photograph Ex.P-3
in the court remains unrebutted.
417\. PW-25 Inspector Ram Aadhar Ram, Officer Incharge, P.S. Brari, District
Bhagalpur deposed that on 13.7.1974 at about 9.30 or 9.45 AM, he received
information that some strangers have come to Maqbara Khanjarpur. He took PW-24
with him at 10 AM, from Chhotti Khanjarpur Chowk and reached Maqbara
Khanjarpur. On the way to Maqbara, he informed PW-24 about their purpose of
going CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 520 there. On the roof of Maqbara, they found two
strangers, he (PW-25) made enquiries from them, and one of them was having a
bag. He (PW-25) was not satisfied of their reply and wanted to check the bag.
The person carrying the bag refused and threw it towards his companion. He
(PW-25) moved towards other man in order to seize the bag but he again threw
it towards the first man. He (PW-25) secured the first man, who was having
that bag initially and that bag fell down on the ground from where he (PW-25)
lifted. The other person started running away towards the East. PW-24 chased
him, but could not succeed. He would be in a position to identify that man,
who escaped from there and identified that person as Vikram approver (PW-2) by
pointing towards him, who was present in the court. He (PW-25) raised the
alarm at the spot, when the bag was being thrown. Mahant Kishan Mohan Dass
(PW-42) and Mahender came there. The witness (PW-25) has identified the Bag
Ex.P-7, which was taken from the hands of the person apprehended at the spot.
After they were brought down, he opened the bag Ex.P-7 in the presence of
afore said two public witnesses and PW-24. It was found to contain three hand-
grenades Ex.P-11 to Ex.P-13 in a plastic container, Revolver Ex.P-14 and two
live cartridges Ex.P-15 and Ex.P-16, two Letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B and
papers Ex.PW-25/A to Ex.PW-25/E. He put his signatures on the letters and
papers at point 'X', while taking the same into his possession. He prepared a
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-25/F, which was attested by Mahant Kishan Mohan Dass
(PW-42) and Mahender.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 521 The person apprehended by him, initially gave his
name as Suresh and thereafter as Suraj Prakash and again as Budheshawaranand
and that man is dead and he identified the photograph of the person
apprehended from whom the recovery was effected to be Ex.P-3. He prepared the
rukka Ex.PW-25/G in his own handwriting and it bears his signatures and
endorsement Ex.PW-25/G-1 on the rukka is in his handwriting and bears his
signatures, which was sent by him to Police Station Kotwali. The three hand
grenades were sent by him to Expert at Calcutta for examination with a
forwarding letter Ex.PW-25/H and it bears his signatures at Point A.
418\. The letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B seized from persons at Maqbara
were given to him by PW-15 when PW-2 accompanied by Amar Singh went to PW-15.
Ex.P-3 is photograph, which has been identified by PW-1 and PW-2 as that of
Tyageshwaranand @ Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh. This photograph Ex.P-3 is of
the person, who has been identified to be Amar Singh by PW-36 Baidyanath
Parshad Sinha. When he was apprehended at Maqbara by PW-25 Inspector Ram
Aadhar Ram, he gave his name as Suresh Singh, then Ramesh Singh, then Suraj
Prakash and also as Budheshawaranand.
419\. In his cross-examination, PW-25 admitted the suggestion of the defence
that it is correctly written in the rukka Ex.PW-25/G at point A to A that
person apprehended received minor injuries while he was CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 522

written in the case diary that these hand grenades, pistol etc. were collected
for murdering Madhavanand.

incident, are available in Folder R-2.
421\. I have scrutinized the deposition of PW-25 and its perusal shows that
his testimony regarding recovery of afore said Bag Ex.P-7 containing three
hand grenades, one pistol with two cartridges and letters etc. from
Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh has not been discredited by the defence in his
cross-examination. His testimony of identifying PW-2 Vikram in the court is
also not challenged. PW-25 has also identified the photograph Ex.P-3 of the
person apprehended and that version of PW-25 could not be discredited by the
defence.
422\. PW-42 Mahant Krishan Mohan Dass deposed that on 13.7.1974 at about
10.30/11 AM, he was present in his Mandir (Temple), which was at a distance of
about 100 yards from the Maqbara of Chhotti Khanjarpur. He heard the alarm
from the said Maqbara and came CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 523 there where he found arrival
of another witness Mohinder Dass. They had gone on the roof of the Maqbara and
found Inspector Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25) having already secured a man, who gave
his name as Suresh and was having a bag with chain. He identified the bag
Ex.P-7 and that person was brought downstairs and bag was searched by PW- 25
and PW-24 who returned there after chasing the other person. He deposed that
three hand grenades, one country-made pistol, two bullets, one plastic
container containing two detonators of hand grenades, two letters, 4/5 pieces
of papers written in Hindi and English, were taken out from that bag. A
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-25/F was prepared bearing his signatures at point A.
Inspector Ram Aadhar Ram signed the letter and pieces of papers. The witness
identified the articles recovered from the Bag Ex.P-7. He identified hand
grenades Ex.P-11 to Ex.P-13, Revolver Ex.P-14, Bullets Ex.P-15 & Ex.P-16. He
also identified the photograph of the man Ex.P-3 from whom said bag Ex.P-7
containing the said articles was recovered.
423\. In his cross-examination, PW-42 deposed that no rough site plan was
prepared at the spot. The personal search of the person secured was taken but
nothing was recovered. He was aged about 25 or 30 years. He was speaking
Hindi. He was wearing white pant and shirt. He stated to the police that two
detonators were found in plastic container. When he was confronted with his
previous statement, there was no mention of plastic dibba. Police remained at
the place for about three hours. There were some abrasions on the person of
the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 524 man apprehended by Inspector Ram Aadhar Ram.
Initially, he gave his name as Suresh and then as Suraj Prakash. He has denied
the suggestion that photograph Ex.P-3 is not of the man, who was apprehended
by Ram Aadhar Ram. He also denied the suggestion that the above said articles
were not recovered from the bag Ex.P-7 in his presence.
424\. PW-138 Sh. R.P. Malhotra was the Deputy Controller of Explosive at
Calcutta from 1972 to 1976. I have already referred his introductory statement
while dealing with the incident dated 07.01.1974. He deposed that on
26.7.1974, he visited P.S. Barari, District Bhagalpur on the request of S.P.
Bhagalpur Sh. Vijay Partap Singh. He met Sh. Ram Aadhar Ram (PW-25), Officer
Incharge P.S. Barari. On the same day i.e. 26.07.1974, three hand grenades and
two numbers of Ignitor Sets were shown to him. After preliminary examination,
he tested and destroyed the Ignitor Sets and handed over the remaining three
hand grenades to the Officer Incharge with advice to send the same to Calcutta
Office for further examination. Regarding his examination of the hand
grenades, he had given his handwritten Preliminary Report dated 26.07.1974
Ex.PW-138/A, which is correct and bears his signatures at point 'A'.
425\. As per this Report Ex.PW-138/A dated 26/7/1974, PW-138 visited Barari
Police Station and took charge of two numbers of Ignitor Sets and three
numbers of hand grenades from the Officer CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 525 Incharge, Barari,
PW-25. All three hand grenades were found by him without any Ignitor Sets.
Both the detonators of the Ignitor Sets were used up during test at Barari
P.S. and he handed over three hand grenades to Officer Incharge, Barari with
advise to send the same to the office of Deputy Chief Controller of Explosive,
East Circle, 8, Esplanade, East Calcutta through a special Messenger for
further examination.
(Preliminary Report Ex.PW-138/A dated 26.07.1974 is available in Folder R-1)
426\. PW-138 further deposed that a sealed packet containing the three hand
grenades was received in the Office of Deputy Chief Controller, Calcutta on
17.1.1975 through Constable Ram Narain Singh, number 561 and Constable
Sudarshan Singh, number 568, P.S. Barari. These were received by Sh. Tapan
Kumar Bandhopadhaya, Deputy Controller of Explosive. He can identify his
writing and signatures as he had seen him writing and signing and Sh. Tapan
Kumar Bandhopadhaya has left the department and he does not know about his
present whereabouts. He examined the contents of the sealed parcel on
28.2.1975 and these hand grenades found to contain T.N.T, a high explosive and
these hand grenades were referred to the laboratory for chemical examination
to the Assistant Chemical Examiner Mr. Ray. He deposed that hand grenades
Ex.P-11, Ex.P-12 and Ex.P-13 are the same, which were examined by him and they
have the same marking and he had noted the marking numbers of these CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 526 hand grenades. He further deposed that he tested Ignitor Sets at
P.S. Barari on 26.7.1974 and destroyed. These hand grenades Ex.P-11, Ex.P-12
and Ex.P-13 bear the marking, which appear to be the same, as were examined by
him at P.S. Barari on 26.7.1974. He proved his Report Ex.PW-138/B. As per this
Report dated 28.02.1975 Ex.PW- 138/B, all these three hand grenades were found
to contain a high explosive charge of T.N.T. (Tri-Nitro-Toluene) and such hand
grenades are capable of endangering life on explosion after being suitably
ignited with an Ignitor Set or otherwise.
                        (Report dated 28.02.1975   Ex.PW-138/B      is
                        available in Folder R-1)
427\. In his cross-examination, PW-138 replied that TNT, which stands for Tri-
nitro-toluene, which is an explosive, is visible to naked eyes. It is in the
jacket shell of hand grenade. It was not possible to open the hand grenade in
the Police Station Barari to ascertain about the presence of TNT in the hand
grenades. After receiving the hand grenades in their office, he examined them
and found TNT present. At present TNT is not present in the hand grenades
Ex.P-11, P-12 and P-13 as the same has been destroyed by the chemical
examiner. He denied the suggestion that he has intentionally destroyed the
Ignitors and TNT, so that his report might not be challenged by re-examining
of the exhibits. The year of manufacture of the hand grenades was mentioned as
1967 and the life of such hand grenades is about 15 years. He deposed that as
per his report these hand grenades were CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 527 received by him
in a sealed wooden box. He admitted the suggestion of the defence that these
hand grenades were manufactured and assembled in different factories. He has
denied the suggestion of the defence that his Report Ex.PW-138/A is false one.
428\. A perusal of the deposition of explosive expert PW-138 reflects that his
deposition that the hand grenades were found to contain TNT, which was capable
enough endangering life on explosion, has not been discredited. I find the
other part of the cross-examination of PW- 138 as irrelevant to the facts in
issue.
429\. From the testimony of PW-2 and PW-13, it comes out that in the first
week of July 1974, A-1 in the presence of PW-13 handed over a packet duly
packed and a letter in a closed envelop to PW-2 at Delhi for its delivery to
Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur. Accordingly, PW- 2 delivered that packet and
letter to Budheshawaranand. Thereafter, PW-2 and Budheshawaranand stayed at
the rented house of PW-15. Budheshawaranand was none else but Amar Singh.
PW-15 gave him two reference letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B (both dated
04.07.1974) to enable him to visit and stay at Muzaffarpur. As discussed under
the caption "PW-2 Joining of Criminal Conspiracy", during the stay of PW-2 at
Bhagalpur, Budheshawaranand brought him to Chautham at the house of Gopalji
who had his farmhouse at Tilihar and both of them were introduced as members
of Revolutionary Group and Budheshawaranand informed Gopalji that CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 528 PW-2 had been sent by Santoshanand. On 13.07.1974,
Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh @ Tyageshwaranand, who was carrying a bag
containing the said packet and articles including detonators, loaded revolver
etc., accompanied PW-2 to a tomb at Khanjarpur, Bhagalpur. There PW-25
apprehended Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh with the above said articles. Those
articles were recovered in the presence of two public witnesses including
PW-42, who has proved the Search List. The packet was found kept in the thaila
(bag), which was found to contain three hand grenades, which were handed over
by A-1 at IARI, Pusa, New Delhi to PW-2 in the presence of PW-13 to be
delivered to Budheshawaranand. The arrest of Amar Singh @ Budheshawaranand and
recovery of the before said articles, preparation of search list and escape of
PW-2 from the site has also been proved by PW-24 and PW-
25\. PW-2 has been identified not only by PW-15 but also by PW-24 and PW-25.
The recovery of two letters Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW- 15/B from the said thaila
further lends credence to the testimony of PW-2 that those reference letters
were given by PW-15 to Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh on his request in his
presence, when they stayed at the residence of PW-15. On examining the said
recovered hand grenades from the bag carried by Amar Singh @ Budheshawaranand
in the company of PW-2, by explosive expert PW- 138, it was found that the
same were containing TNT, which on explosion could endanger life. Thus, the
testimony of the approver CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 529 PW-2 stands corroborated in all
the material particulars so far by the corroborative evidence of PW-13, PW-15,
PW-24, PW-25, PW-42, and PW-138. These facts are enough to believe the case of
the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt regarding the complicity of A-1,
Budheshawaranand @ Amar Singh @ Tyageshwaranand (deceased), PW-2 and A-7 in
the criminal conspiracy.
39) Aftermath - incident of Khanjarpur
430\. PW-2 further deposed that next day (i.e. 14.07.1974), he went to
Chautham and met A-1 there. A-7 was also present there and he told him about
the delivery of the packet to Budheshawaranand, keeping of the packet in a bag
by Budheshawaranand and arrest of Budheshawaranand by the police along with
the bag containing the packet. He informed A-1 in the presence of A-7 that he
could not pick up the bag for the fear of being arrested. On asking of A-1,
PW-2 further informed him that the packet sent by him was in the bag and on
knowing this A-1 was shocked and he held his forehead in his both hands and
told him that the packet contained three hand grenades. He deposed that he
stayed at the house at Chautham for 4/5 days. He testified that meetings of
the members of Revolutionary Group used to be held at the house of A-7 at
Chautham and at farmhouse of A-7 at Tilihar. Apart from him, A-1, A-2,
Arteshanand (since deceased) and A-7 used to attend those meetings. The
meetings were addressed by A-1, who used to tell that they had to procure arms
for revolution in order to get the Baba released. In his cross-examination,
PW-2 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 530 deposed that he did not state in Ex.PW-2/L that
meetings used to be held at the house of A-7 and in the statement Ex.PW-2/L,
it was found mentioned that meetings were held at Chautham. He explained that
by saying that meetings were held at Chautham, he meant to say at the house of
A-7 at Chautham. In his further cross-examination at Page No. 91, he admitted
the suggestion of the defence that on 14.07.1974, he was at Chautham.
431\. The testimony of PW-2 is not discredited by the defence including A-7
that A-7 had a house at Chautham and a farmhouse at Tilihar. The defence could
not deride that PW-2 went to Chautham on 14.07.1974 and stayed in his house or
that meetings of members of the Revolutionary Group used to be held at his
house and farmhouse, attended by A-7, PW-2, A-1, A-2, Arteshanand and meeting
used to be addressed by A-1. These assertions of PW-2 have also not been
discredited by the other accused persons. The accused could not shake
narration of the incident at Khanjarpur Maqbara by PW-2. Rather, by giving the
suggestion that on 14.07.1974, PW-2 was at Chautham, the defence has admitted
the version of the approver PW-2. Therefore, the testimony of approver PW-2
stand further corroborated and renders it to be believed.
40) Attempt to procure arms and ammunitions.
432\. PW-2 deposed that they had to procure arms for a revolution in order to
get the Baba released. While he was at Chautham after the CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 531
incident at Maqbara, Khanjarpur dated 13.07.1974, A-1 asked him to go to Indo-
Nepal Border and meet Anand Margies there and procure arms from them. A-1
further told PW-2 to meet Sh. Paras Nath (PW-
27), a Railway Guard of Narkatiaganj and one Khub Lal of Bitia; both of them
were Anand Margies. He went there and did not know Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27).
However, he knew Khub Lal, who introduced him to Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27). Sh.
Paras Nath (PW-27) introduced him to Sh. Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) of Village
Chamua. Despite best efforts, he was not able to procure any arms. The defence
gave suggestion to PW-2 at Page No. 91 that he was at Narkatiaganj, Chamua,
Rajgir and Chakia in November 1974.
433\. PW-2 further deposed that he was introduced to Khub Lal by Sh. Ram
Aasrey at his shop at Bitia in the month of September/October 1974, as
"Subir". Ram Aasrey requested Khub Lal to introduce him (PW-2) to Sh. Paras
Nath, Guard (PW-27). Next day Khub Lal took him to Narkatiaganj at the quarter
of Paras Nath, Guard (PW-27) and introduced him to Sh. Paras Nath, Guard, as
Subir, a worker of Anand Marg. He deposed that Khub Lal told Sh. Paras Nath
(PW-27) that he (PW-2) would be staying with him for some days. Those were
Durga Pooja days and he stayed at his house for 3/4 days. He came back to
Chakia and about one month thereafter he went again to Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27).
He told Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27) that Baba could not be got released by legal
means and armed revolution (Sashatra Kranti) had to be resorted to. He CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 532 requested him to help him in procurement of arms as far as it was
possible for him and Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27) just replied to him that he would
see to it. During these visits, he was introduced by Paras Nath (PW-27) to
some other Anand Margies, who were living in the vicinity. Those were
including Sh. Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) and Sh. Radha Kishan. He talked to Sh.
Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) and told him about their failure to get Baba released
by legal means and Sashatra Kranti was the need, and he thus came back to
Chakia from the place of Paras Nath (PW-27). He stayed for 3-4 days with him
during this visit.
434\. It is seen in the cross-examination that meeting with Paras Nath (PW-27)
took place at the house of Paras Nath at Narkatiaganj. The house of Khub Lal
is on the main road near bus stand but he could not tell the name of the
Mohalla. He could not give the names of the persons residing in the vicinity
of the house of Khub Lal, as he never met anybody in his vicinity. He deposed
that he stayed at Bitia with Khub Lal for one night, when Ram Aasrey
introduced him. He visited Bitia three or four times. On his second visit, he
stayed for 10 or 15 days and on the other occasion, he stayed for a day or so.
He did not remember the dates of his visit, but the same were in the month of
September and October 1974. It was November/December 1974, when Paras Nath
introduced him to Roop Nath Mishra of Village Chamua at the house of Paras
Nath. He deposed that he informed Paras Nath and Roop Nath Mishra the purpose
of his visit. He has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 533 denied the suggestion that he was
never deputed to collect any arms by A-1 or that he had no meeting with A-1.
He did not remember whether he stated in the Committing Court that
Santoshanand asked him to meet Paras Nath, Railway Guard of Narkatiaganj and
Khub Lal of Bitia. When he was confronted with the statement of the Committing
Court Ex.PW-2/DF, where it was found recorded that A-1 deputed him to procure
arms and ammunitions from Anand Margies, residing along Indo-Nepal Boarder and
under this instructions he went to Paras Nath, Railway Guard, Narkatiaganj,
who was a Anand Margi. He did not state in this statement Ex.PW-2/DF that Ram
Aasrey introduced him to Khub Lal or that he told his name to Khub Lal as
Subir. He did not state in the Committing Court that when he again went to
Paras Nath, he told him that Baba could not be got released by legal means and
Sashatra Kranti had to be resorted to as no such question was put to him.
435\. PW-27 Paras Nath Singh deposed that during the period between 1968 and
1975, he was working as Railway Guard, at Narkatiaganj (Bihar). He took Diksha
in the year 1968 from Aacharya Parmanand Srivastava of Anand Marg. He knew
Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) of Village Chamua, Narkatiaganj. He came in contact
with Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) about five or seven months after he joined
Railways Service. He was a commission agent at Railway Station Chamua Halt. He
was Aacharya of Anand Marg. He also knew Khub Lal since the year 1969 and he
was Anand Margi and had a shop at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 534 Bitia. He further deposed
that after taking Diksha from Aacharya Parmanand Srivastava, he often used to
visit him but sometimes Aacharya himself used to visit him. During Durga Pooja
days of the year 1974, he was at Narkatiaganj, when Khub Lal visited him. At
that time, he was accompanied by one person, who was introduced to this
witness by Khub Lal as "Subir" of Anand Marg and he would be in a position to
identify the afore said "Subir". (The witness has correctly identified PW-2 in
the Court). He further deposed that Khub Lal informed him that PW-2 was a
worker of Anand Marg and he would meet the people for propaganda of Anand
Marg. He made a request to allow Subir to stay with him for one or two days to
which he agreed. Khub Lal then went away. PW-2 stayed with him 4-5 days and
was not in the dress of Avadhoot but in plain clothes and had small mustaches
and cut hair on the head. He was not sporting any beard. PW-2 told him that he
was full-time worker of Anand Marg, and one month later PW-2 came to him
alone. He had a general talk with PW-2. PW-27 told him about Roop Nath Mishra
(PW-80), Amresh Chand, Radha Kishan, and Anand Kishore. PW-2 informed him that
Baba was in custody and was to be released by revolution alone. To achieve the
object, arms, ammunitions and money was to be collected and requested him to
help him in this regard, as it was border area with Nepal, for which PW-27
expressed his inability. Then PW-2 requested him to find other sources. PW-2
stayed with him for about 2 or 3 days during that visit. This time, PW-2 used
to go out from his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 535 house in the Morning and come
back in the Evening and he had gone to meet Amresh Chand. At his (PW-27)
residence, he met Anand Kishore, Radha Kishan, Roop Nath (PW-80) and then he
went away.
436\. In his cross-examination, PW-27 replied that Roop Nath Mishra, Khub Lal,
Amresh Chand were residing at Narkatiaganj and surrounding area. Khub Lal was
not in a position to regularly visit his place, whereas Radha Kishan and Nand
Kishore used to visit him regularly. He further answered that Anand Kishore
and Radha Kishan used to meet Subir at his residence and once Roop Nath Mishra
also met him. He replied that sometimes aforesaid meetings used to be in his
presence. In the meetings, there used to be general discussions. He admitted
the suggestion that in May 1975, the police searched his house and nothing
objectionable was found. He refused to give any assistance to PW-2, when he
first of all asked him to help in arranging arms and ammunitions. PW-2 again
talked to him on his next visit and he told him not to have a talk with him on
that subject.
437\. A perusal of the testimony of PW-27 disclose that the defence has not at
all belied regarding the visits of PW-2 meeting him and several persons in
connection with procurement of resources and arms. The testimony of PW-2 has
been corroborated by PW-27 about visit of PW-2 to procure arms.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 536
438\. PW-80 Roop Nath Mishra of Village Chamua (Bihar) deposed that he took
Diksha as Anand Margi in 1958 from Aacharya Vishwanath Singh and he became
Aacharya in the year 1963. In the year 1964, marriage of his daughter was
solemnized according to Sanatan Dharam rites. He had given cash, ornaments and
clothes in the marriage of his daughter. In connection with giving of dowry,
he was called to Jamalpur in the year 1964. In those days, Anand Murti was at
Jamalpur. He was also known as Baba. He was produced before Anand Murti by Sh.
P.K. Chatterjee, General Secretary of Anand Marg. Anand Murti became very
angry and reprimanded him on giving of dowry in the marriage. Anand Murti
constituted a committee for taking action against him. Committee took a
decision that he should get back his dowry from son-in-law and give the same
to Bitia Children Home of Anand Marg. He could not get back the dowry from his
son-in-law for depositing the same at Bitia Children Home of Anand Marg. For
this reason, he was deprived of Aacharyaship in 1964. He attended Dharam Maha
Chakra of Anand Marg of Patna, Bitia, Motihari and Muzaffarpur. He lastly
attended Dharam Maha Chakra in the year 1971. He knew Ram Aasrey since 1958\.
He was an old worker of Anand Marg. He was a full time worker and holding the
designation of Aacharya. He knew Sh. Paras Nath Singh (PW-27), who was also an
Anand Margi. He was Railway Guard posted at Narkatiaganj. He was known to him
since the year 1958 as Narkatiaganj is at a distance of 6 KMs from his Village
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 537 Chamua and the nearest market from his Village is
Narkatiaganj. Sh. Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) used to reside at Railway Quarters
at Narkatiaganj. Sometimes, he (PW-80) used to visit Paras Nath Singh (PW-27)
at his house. He (PW-80) met one person by the name of Subir at the house of
Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) at Narkatiaganj in the year 1974 about 1 or 1½ months
of Dusshera. Subir was introduced to him by Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) and Subir
expressed his desire to visit his house and in those days JP Andolan was going
on. In the house of Paras Nath Singh (PW-27), Subir told him that Baba would
be got released by Krantikari. He would be in a position to identify Subir
(The witness has correctly identified Subir by pointing towards Vikram). He
further testified that on the same day, Subir came and stayed at his house.
Subir stayed at his house and told him that Baba would be get released by
Sangharsh.
439\. The cross-examination of PW-80 reveals that Aacharya Ram Aasrey met him
for the first time in Dharam Maha Chakra but he did not remember in which year
he met him. He had never gone to his house but Aacharya Ram Aasrey visited his
house once in February or March 1975. He came to his house by chance. He did
not talk to Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) or anybody else that they should get
Anand Murti released by adopting illegal means. Without his asking, Paras Nath
Singh (PW-27) himself told him that Subir wanted to get Anand Murti released
by adopting illegal and violent means. He suggested Subir that nothing should
be done by violence. He testified that Paras CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 538 Nath Singh
(PW-27) was present apart from him when talk about release of Anand Murti by
Krantikari. In his further cross- examination, PW-80 admitted the suggestion
of the defence that he joined Anand Marg, since it believed in pious living,
social service, impart education in yoga, sadhna for salvation, pure living,
rending social service, eradication of evils from society, removal of dowry
system, simple living and high thinking. They also believed in Ahinsa (non-
violence).
440\. Perusal of testimony of PW-80 Sh. Roop Nath Mishra makes it clear that
PW-2 by name Subir visited him around Dusshera festival of 1974, which
generally fall in the month of October. He corroborated the version of PW-2 to
the effect that he (PW-2) told that Baba could not be released by legal means
and he would be got released only by armed revolution. The defence in their
lengthy cross- examination could not discredit this testimony of PW-80 as
regards the visits of PW-2 in his attempt to achieve the mission.
441\. Defence has examined DW-21 Sh. Niranjan Dev to dispel the case of the
prosecution that Ram Aasrey, Paras Nath (PW-27) and Vikram (PW-2) used to come
to his father Sh. Khub Lal at Bitia for collection of arms and ammunitions. He
deposed that his father Khub Lal was an Anand Margi and died in October, 2002.
In his cross- examination, it is elicited that in the year 1973-1974 he was
13-14 years of age and a school-goer in Bitia. He could not know the names CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 539 of those persons who used to come to his father
during his school time which used to be from 10.30 AM to 3.00 PM.
I fear that believing this witness, who was a juvenile at the relevant period
of time and small school going kid, who could perceive nothing, would be only
a disservice to the cause of justice. Therefore, the testimony of this witness
is not useful to the either side.
442\. The cross-examination of PW-2 is nothing but re-address of the
examination-in-chief. The questions and suggestions particularly at Page No.
91 put prove the prosecution's case. The defence got elicited in the cross-
examination that PW-2 visited all the places as claimed in his chief. Here it
is pertinent to mention that in his further cross- examination the defence has
given him the suggestion that in the month of November, 1974, PW-2 was at
Narkatiaganj, Chamua, Rajgir and Chakia. The say of PW-2 is further
corroborated on all material facts with the testimonies of PW-27 and PW-80.
The defence witness examined is not helpful to them since DW-21 was an
innocent minor at the relevant period of time and the evidentiary value of
this witness is already discussed above. Therefore, this court has no
hesitation to hold that the prosecution proved its case that pursuant to the
criminal conspiracy, attempts were made by the conspirators to collect arms
and ammunitions for their ill conceived designs.
41) Meet at Rajgir in Nov' 74 convened by A-1.
    443. PW-2's              testimony   further   reveals   that   a   meeting        of
    CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.                                                Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 540 Revolutionary
Group at Rajgir was held in November 1974 after unsuccessful efforts to
procure arms, convened by A-1. Apart from himself, A-1, A-2, Arteshanand and
Anand Margies of Bhagalpur, attended. A-1 addressed the meeting. A-1 told them
that Sadvipra Raj could not be established without armed revolution, for which
he exhorted to collect arms. A-1 emphasized that each one of them would have
to work to achieve the end and asked to enroll at least 25 reliable persons
each so for the purpose. PW-2 further testified that A- 1 informed him earlier
and directed him to attend, which he did.
On this aspect, there is no cross-examination to undo the assertions of PW-2.
42) Shifting of PW-2 to Chakia (Bihar)
444\. I find from the testimony of PW-2 that he shifted his headquarter at
Chakia in Bihar for revolutionary activities, on his own. He used to visit
neighbouring places for the purpose of collecting arms. A-1 and A-2 used to
give him money for this work and for his daily expenses. A-2 used to come to
Chakia on the directions of A-1 to give him instructions.
In the cross-examination of PW-2, at Page No. 91, he admitted the suggestion
of the defence that he was at Narkatiaganj, Chamua, Rajgir and Chakia in
November 1974.
445\. Thus, the deposition of PW-2 could not be discredited by the defence and
his visit at Chakia, drawing instructions from A-1 and A-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 541 2 and the support given by A-1 and A-2 to collect the
arms have remained untouched in the cross-examination. Rather, by giving the
suggestion to PW-2 in his cross-examination at Page No. 91 that he was at
Narkatiaganj, Chamua, Rajgir and Chakia in November, 1974, the defence admits
the version of the approver PW-2.
43) A-1's stay at Ashok Lodge, Patna.
446\. PW-2's testimony reveals that in the third week of December 1974, A-2
came to him at Chakia. A-2 gave the message of A-1 that A-1 would be waiting
for PW-2 at Gandhi Maidan Patna on 29.12.1974 in the morning. Accordingly,
PW-2 went there and he found only A-2, who took him to Ashok Lodge/Ashok
Niketan at Patna where A-1 met him. A-1, who occupied one room there on upper
floor, told PW-2 that thenceforth meetings would be held in that room, which
he took on rent. He further deposed that A-1 directed him to reach Samastipur
on 01.1.1975 and make arrangements for stay of 2 or 3 persons at the house of
some Anand Margi or in some Dharamshala (Lodge). A-1 told PW-2 that A-1 would
be at the Railway Station by 04.00 or 5 O'clock in the Evening on 01.1.1975
where he asked PW-2 to meet him.
447\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 gave an answer that Ashok Lodge was also
known as Ashok Niketan. In the committal court, on asking, he has stated that
it was also known as Ashok Niketan. It is elicited that he did not state so in
his statement U/s. 164 Cr. PC that it CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 542 was also known as
Ashok Niketan, since it was not questioned. He did not remember the number of
the room of the Ashok Lodge or Niketan, which was rented. He also did not know
what the room rent was. He did not notice whether any sign board of this
building was hanging outside the building. The colour of the building was
white. He did not remember the name of the Manager of that Lodge.
448\. This fact deposed by PW-2 that in Ashok Lodge at Patna a room had been
taken on rent by A-1, is corroborated by PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar, who is the son
of the owner of the Lodge known as "Ashok Niketan/Ashok Lodge". PW-23 deposed
that in the year 1974, he was a student of B.Sc. (final year). He and his
father have been managing the affairs. PW-23 saw the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A
belonging to them and deposed that on 28.12.1974, one person came to him and
told his name as "Vinod Kumar". The visitor informed PW-23 that he was an
agent of Law Books of which headquarter is at Allahabad. The visitor was
wearing a hearing aid. He testified that he would be in a position to identify
him and he identified the accused Santoshanand correctly in the court. Further
he went on to narrate that A-1 was given a room on the second floor of his
house on rent at the rate of Rs.55/- per month, which was agreed by A-1. PW-23
also inquired from him about his permanent address. An advance sum of Rs.55/-
was paid by A-1 for the month of January 1975. On asking of PW-23, the said
person wrote down his address in their Note Book Ex.PW-23/A. (This Note Book
is also exhibited as Ex.P-6). He CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 543 deposed that the portion
Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) encircled with blue pencil and portion Ex.PW-23/A-1 encircled
with red pencil in the Note Book Ex.PW23/A were written by this "Vinod Kumar",
who is none other than A-1 as identified, in his presence. Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2)
reads as under:-
> "28.12.74"
> "Binod Kumar S/o Mr. Sumanji Sahay Sitarampur Maniari P.O. Maniari Dist -
> Muzaffarpur"
> (Note Nook Ex.PW-23/A = Ex.P-6 is available in the Folder R-4).
449\. PW-23 further testified that the accused Vinod Kumar brought his luggage
in that room. He deposed that 3 or 4 persons used to visit Lodger in his room
and he would be in a position to identify those persons visiting the said
Vinod Kumar (A-1 as identified). He identified accused "A-2", "Arteshanand"
and "PW-2" also in the court and these persons used to call "Vinod Kumar" as
"Boss". "Vinod Kumar" stayed there till June 1975. He testified that he used
to take rent from "Vinod Kumar" regarding which entries were made in the Note
Book Ex.PW-23/A and the entries Ex.PW-23/A-2 to Ex.PW- 23/A-8 in the Note Book
Ex.PW-23/A are in the handwriting of his father Sh. Mahender Prasad Singh. He
further testified that on 8th or 9th June 1975, he had gone to Village Jug
Dumari, PS Pun-Pun, Distt. Patna in connection with his marriage and returned
there on CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 544 18.6.1975. He found the room rented to Vinod
Kumar, lying vacant and on enquiry, he came to know that the room was vacated
2-3 days earlier. He had seen Vinod Kumar in that room one or two days before
his going to Village Jug Dumari.
450\. PW-23 further deposed that Bihar Police came to his house and brought
with them the person present in the court by pointing out towards Arteshanand
(who died later on during trial). He also testified that on 09.07.1975, Note
Book Ex.PW-23/A was taken into possession by CBI vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-23/B,
which bears his signatures at point A and that of his father at point B. He
has also signed the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A at point X-1 and X-2 and his father
signed at points Y-1 and Y-2 on the front page and the last but one page, at
the time when the same was taken into possession by CBI. He further testified
that this Note Book Ex.PW-23/A used to be kept in their room, in which entries
were being made by him and by his father. He had seen his father writing and
signing and as such, he was in a position to identify handwritings and
signature of his father. He deposed that his father was aged about 60 years
and not keeping good health.
451\. In his cross-examination, PW-23 replied that their family was not
staying in their house known as Ashok Niketan and Ashok Lodge. He replied that
his father did not come, as he has been a heart patient. The land on which the
building Ashok Niketan exists is in the name of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 545 his
mother. His father is an agriculturist. They have not been paying any income
tax of rental income from the Lodge. He deposed that on 28.12.1974 Vinod Kumar
came to him while wearing pant and shirt. He was not sporting beard but had
small moustaches. He was not wearing any turban. He had a little bit of
baldness. They used to get address of the tenants recorded in their Note Book.
He has denied the suggestion that they have forged all entries or that he is a
false witness. In his further cross-examination, PW-23 replied that they did
not report to the corporation about renting out of the Ashok Lodge. In those
days, they did not send any information to the corporation mentioning the
details of the tenants and the rent. He did not remember whether he had stated
in his previous statement that "three or four persons" used to visit Vinod
Kumar in his room in Ashok Niketan. When he was confronted with his previous
statement, there was mention of "three more persons". He stated that he did
not see these persons talking to each other and did not try to overhear
conversation between Vinod Kumar and his companions. He had seen them
addressing Vinod Kumar as "Boss". He did not make any inquiry as to why three
or four persons were coming to that room, which was rented out to Vinod Kumar
only. He did not make inquiry from Vinod Kumar about his companions. Vinod
Kumar and his companions did not go out of his Lodge to ease themselves. They
used to have their bags with them. Sometimes, they used to come together and
sometimes, two persons used to come there. He might have seen CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 546 accused by pointing towards Arteshanand Avadhoot (since deceased)
7 or 8 times. He admitted that there is no entry in his hand in the Note Book
Ex.PW-23/A and all the entries are in the handwriting of his father. He has
denied the suggestion that all are forged entries in the Note Book or that he
made a false statement or that Arteshanand and Vikram did not visit the Lodge
at any time.
452\. I have carefully scrutinized the testimony of PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar. In
his cross-examination, the defence despite lengthy cross- examination could
not dislodge the fact that PW-23 owned a Lodge and a room in their Lodge was
not taken on rent by the said Vinod Kumar, (who was identified as A-1 in the
court) on 28.12.1974 at the rate of Rs.55/- per month and A-2, PW-2 and
Arteshanand visiting him. His testimony that A-1 under the assumed name of
Vinod Kumar has written his address on the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A at point
Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) is also not demolished in cross-examination by the accused
persons. They have only given the suggestion about Arteshanand and Vikram not
visiting the Lodge for which PW-23 asserted that he had seen Arteshanand
(since deceased) about 8 times in the Lodge. The defence had not drawn to show
any enmity of PW- 23 with the accused. PW-23 is an independent witness. His
testimony is found to be trustworthy and believable. The A-1 in his cross-
examination has also not objected to the identification of his writing on
Ex.PW-2/C in the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A = Ex.P-6. Thus, PW-23 has further
corroborated the statement of approver PW-2 Sh. Vikram CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 547
that this writing Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) in the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A (Ex.P-6) is in
the handwriting of accused Santoshanand, who stayed in the Lodge under the
assumed name of "Vinod Kumar".
453\. PW-131 Sh. M.P. Singh, Dy. SP, CBI deposed on this aspect that he was
assisting Chief Investigation Officer Sh. H.L. Ahuja and on 09.7.1975, he
examined Ashok Kumar (PW-23) and his father Mahender Singh of Ashok Niketan,
Patna. He further testified that he seized Note Book Ex.PW-23/A and entries
Ex.PW-23/A-1, Q-2 and Q-2/1 did exist in the note book. He prepared Seizure
Memo Ex.PW- 23/B in his handwriting in respect of said notebook. It bears his
signatures at point 'A', of Ashok Kumar (PW-23) at point 'B' and Mahender
Singh at Point 'C'. He also obtained the initials of Ashok and Mahender Prasad
Singh on the first and last page of the notebook and he had also put his own
initials there. The initials of Ashok are at point X-2 and of Mahender Prasad
Singh at point Y-2. His own initials are at point Z.
454\. In his cross-examination, PW-131 replied that he did not inquire from
Ashok and Mahender Singh of Ashok Niketan as to whether Vinod Kumar executed
any rent deed. He did not inquire from them whether they had any counterfoil
receipt of the rent with signatures of Vinod Kumar other than the Note Book
Ex.PW-23/A. The Note Book Ex.PW-23/A was not paginated, but they have
paginated at the time of taking it into possession. He admitted that seven
pages of the Note CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 548 Book Ex.PW-23/A are blank. The
relevant entry is on Page No. 16. He did not try to find out as to who were
residing in the other rooms as he did not consider it necessary. There was no
employee of Ashok and Mahender Singh. He did not make any inquiry to find out
as to in whose name the property was registered and who was paying the house
tax. He has denied the suggestion that no such entry existed at Page No. 16 of
the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A or that entry Ex.PW- 23/A-1 was got fabricated on
that page. He admitted that on the page where entry Ex.PW-23/A-1 exists, there
is no other entry on that sheet. He did not inquire as to where from the Vinod
Kumar was having his tea and meals. He did not ask Ashok Kumar and Mahender
Prasad as to why they had left blank pages in the Note Book. He did not go to
the address of Vinod Kumar mentioned in the diary. During investigation, he
came to know that the name of Santoshanand is Vinod Kumar.
455\. The testimony of PW-131 Sh. M.P. Singh is not discredited during the
cross-examination by the defence. He is a public servant and a Senior Police
Officer. He had taken into possession the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A in discharge of
his duties in due course. I found the testimony of PW-131 does not suffer from
any malice.
456\. I have referred in the subsequent paragraphs of the judgment that the
approver PW-2 has identified the handwriting Ex.PW-2/C (Q-
2) on the Note Book Ex.P-6 = Ex.PW-23/A to be in the handwriting of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 549 A-1. This is corroborated by PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar, who has
identified A-1 as having stayed in their Lodge by name Vinod Kumar and has
written Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) in the Notebook Ex.PW-23/A = Ex.P-6, in his presence
28.12.1974. This handwriting of A-1 Ex.PW- 2/C (Q-2) has also been identified
as that of A-1 by PW-33 and PW- 68, which I would deal in the succeeding
paragraphs. Further, the handwriting expert Sh. B. Lal (PW-42) compared the
writing Ex.PW- 2/C (Q-2) with the specimen handwriting of A-1 and found the
same to be in the handwriting of same person. In view of this evidence and
discussion, it has to be concluded that the prosecution was successful to
prove its case very reasonably, that pursuant to the criminal conspiracy
hatched at Trimohan in October 1973, A-1 had taken a room on rent in Ashok
Lodge/Ashok Niketan, Patna on 28.12.1974. He had taken the room under assumed
name of Vinod Kumar by concealing his identity on a rent of Rs.55/- per month.
He continued to occupy the room till about 15th or 16th of June 1975. During
his stay there, his co-accused persons namely A-2, Arteshanand and PW-2 used
to visit him. These persons used to call accused A-1 as "Boss", which further
corroborate the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 that A-1 used to dictate terms to
the co-conspirators and was a ringleader throughout.
44) Macabre incident at Samastipur dated 02.01.1975.
457\. This leads me to refer to the gruesome incident as pleaded in the charge
sheet pursuant to the criminal conspiracy at Trimohan. At the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 550 time of hatching the criminal conspiracy in October 1973, A-1,
A-2, Arteshanand (since deceased), Ram Kumar (PO), Vinayanand (PO) and PW-1
were present, as per the evidence discussed above.
458\. A-7 joined the conspiracy later on when A-1, Vinayanand (PO),
Arteshanand (since deceased), A-2, Tyageshwaranand (since deceased), Ram Kumar
(PO) and PW-1 met A-7 at the house of A-7 at Bhagalpur. A-1 conveyed to A-7
about formation of a Revolutionary Group and they would meet henceforth at the
house of A-7 at Chautham. A-1, during this meeting exhorted that certain
persons were to be eliminated for which arms and ammunitions would be stored
at the house of A-7 at Chautham. A-7 conceded to the meetings to be held
either at Chautham or his farmhouse at Tilihar. Evidence is already discussed,
which pointed to the above facts indelibly. It is also established that PW-1
brought a revolver with live cartridges thereof and 110 other cartridges,
which were handed over to A-7. As already held above, A-7 received two
telegrams Ex.PW-1/O and Ex.PW-1/S dated 03.12.1973 and 17.01.1974 respectively
from A-1 and these two telegrams were recovered at the time of house of A-1 on
17.05.1975.
459\. It is also established that in the first week of July 1974, PW-2
delivered a packet and a letter to Budheshawaranand (since deceased) at
Bhagalpur, which were given to PW-2 by A-1 at IARI Hostel, New Delhi in the
presence of PW-13. Thereafter, Budheshawaranand (since CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 551
deceased) brought PW-2 at Chautham and introduced each other to A- 7 and PW-2
as committed workers. It has also come on record that during November 1974, a
meeting of the members of Group was attended by A-1, A-2, Arteshanand (since
deceased), PW-2 and Anand Margies of Bhagalpur at Rajgir. In the said meeting,
A-1 reiterated that objective of the organisation would be impossible without
armed revolution, for which arms to the maximum extent was needed and
collected.
460\. With this background of the prior acts to the incident, which are proved
as alleged in the charge sheet, the evidence concerning the events dated
02.01.1975 are to be reckoned with. PW-2 in his statement on oath deposed that
on 29.12.1974, when A-2 brought him to Ashok Lodge, Patna, A-1 met him there
and directed PW-2 to reach Samastipur on 01.1.1975 to make arrangements for
stay of 2 or 3 persons with the help of Anand Margies or at any Dharamshala.
A-1 also told him to meet him at Railway Station, where A-1 assured of
reaching there by 4 or 5 O'clock in the evening on 01.01.1975. PW-2
accordingly reached there on 01.1.1975 via Chakia. He made arrangement for
stay of 2/3 persons at the house of Girijanandan, an Anand Margi, whom PW-2
knew. PW-2 reached Railway Station at 4 O' clock on 01.1.1975, met A-2 at 5
PM. A-2 enquired PW-2 whether the arrangements for stay were made or not, for
which PW-2 replied in the affirmative. On enquiry, A-2 told him that A-1 was
present in the first class waiting room at Railway Station. A-2 told him that

his luggage in the first class waiting room at the Railway Station and that
A-3 had gone to meet one of his friends and A-1 was keeping watch on his
luggage. A-2 then went back inside the Railway Station and A-1 came out. A-1
also enquired from PW-2 about the arrangements and PW-2 replied in the
affirmative. A-1 told PW-2 that after A-3's coming back, they would go with
PW-2 to the place arranged for stay. He kept waiting until 8.30 PM and during
this time, sometimes A-1 would come to him and sometimes A-2 and then they
would go back. After 8.30 PM, PW-2 along with A-1 and A-2 reached the room of
Girijanandan. On enquiry by Girijanandan, PW-2 told him that the person in
jacket and pant was A-1, the man wearing kurta and dhoti was A-2, and they
were Anand Margies. He also deposed that Girijanandan did not know both of
them.
461\. It is also found in the statement of PW-2 that they all the three slept
in the room of Girijanandan, who also slept there. They got up at about 5
O'clock in the Morning of 02.01.1975, when Girijanandan was away to answer the
call of nature. A-1 told PW-2 that L.N. Mishra, Railway Minister would be
visiting the very day at Samastipur to inaugurate the Broad Gauge Railway Line
between the Samastipur and Muzaffarpur. A-1 further told them that L.N. Mishra
was the most corrupt minister of Indira Sarkar, a big sinner (Mahapapi),
responsible for bringing their enemies i.e. communists closer to the Congress.
The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 553 said Minister had a dominant role to play in the
Bihar politics and he was the hindrance for release of the Baba/Anand Murti.
A-1 further told that L.N. Mishra was to be liquidated in order to shake the
Government and compel the release of Baba. PW-2 asked A-1 as to what had to be
done for this. A-1 took out three hand grenades from his bag. PW-2 further
deposed that out of those three, A-1 kept one in his pocket of pant, one was
given to A-2, who hid in the pocket of his Kurta and the third hand grenade
was given to PW-2 by A-1. PW-2 kept it in the cloth bag as suggested by A-1
and slung the bag to his shoulder, and covered with woolen chaddar. A-1 was
wearing a full- sleeved jacket and the pant, under the jacket, he was wearing
a sweater, A-2 was wearing a Kurta and Dhoti, and he had wrapped chaddar on
his body. PW-2 was wearing a sweater and under it a shirt and pant.
462\. In his further statement, PW-2 deposed that A-1 told him in the presence
of A-2 as to how to handle the hand grenade. A-1 told PW-2 that the lever of
hand grenade was to be kept pressed with one hand and pin was to be taken out
with the other hand and it would burst within four/five seconds after the pin
was taken out and lever was released and thrown. A-1 also told PW-2 that the
pin could be removed with teeth also. At that time, A-2 was also present. A-1
told them that the hand grenade was to be thrown on his signal. The hand
grenade was of the shape of an egg (oval shape) and one could not clinch his
fist fully by taking the hand grenade in the hand.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 554 Girijanandan reached there after this talk had taken
place. PW-2 further deposed that at 08.00 AM, they all three started towards
Samastipur Railway Station and Girijanandan asked them whether he the meals
arrangements to be made or not. PW-2 told him that meals might be kept ready;
whenever they find time they would come and take their lunch. Then
Girijanandan gave a key of the room to PW-2 and Girijanandan was still there
when they left for the Railway Station. On the way, they walked one behind the
other at some distance from each other. They reached there within 20-25
minutes and at the platform sometimes, they would meet and then would separate
and move out there. PW-2 found Dais, constructed on Platform No. 3 for
inauguration event. There were rows of chairs on Platform No. 3 opposite the
Dais. At about 12 O'clock, PW-2 had seen A-1 and A-2 sitting on the chairs at
Platform No. 3 side-by-side. PW-2 further saw A-3 sitting on a chair in the
row ahead towards the Dais. He had seen A-3 talking to A-1 and A-2 by turning
his face towards them.
463\. The evidence of PW-2 further reveals that Sh. L. N. Mishra was to reach
there at about 01.00 PM but at about 12.30 PM, an announcement was made that
he would reach two hours late. PW-2 was moving about on the Platform No. 1.
After the announcement, A-1 and A-2 got up and came to PW-2 at Platform No. 1.
They told him that as the Minister would be late by two hours, they should go
and take their meals, and hence they went to the room of Girijanandan and CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 555 had their meals there. At about 2 or 2.30 PM, they
came back to the Railway Station, A-1 told PW-2 that A-3 had arranged for
their entry to the function. A-1 told PW-2 to remain on the Platform No. 1 and
wait for further instructions. A-1 and A-2 went to the Platform No. 3 and
occupied the chairs on the rear portion of the rows of chairs i.e. a little
behind the middle row. PW-2 remained moving about on the Platform No. 1, from
where A-1 and A-2 were visible to him at Platform No. 3 and they were sitting
on the extreme part of the rows of the chairs nearest to Platform No. 1. PW-2
further deposed that at 4.00 PM, A-2 came to him and gave PW-2 one "Pass"
issued by Congress Sewa Dal. It looked alike Pass Ex.P-8 shown to him during
the trial. A-2 asked PW-2 to accompany him to Platform No. 3. A-2 had his own
"Pass" also which he had pinned on his chest and PW-2 was carrying the "Pass"
in his hand. He was stopped by the police and they asked him to pin the "Pass"
on his chest. He went out, took a pin from a shop, then came back, and went
inside and at that time he was alone and A-2 had already entered but had kept
a chair vacant for him by their side and he sat there. In the meanwhile,
before he occupied the chair, an announcement was made that the Minister would
be reaching at 5.00 PM.
464\. It has further come in the deposition of PW-2 that Sh. L.N. Mishra
reached there by a Special Train at 5.10 PM from Lahariya Sarai side which
halted on one side of Platform No. 3. Shri L.N. Mishra got down from the
train. Some other persons also came with CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 556 him. L.N. Mishra
came to the munch (Dais) accompanied by large number of persons. One person
spoke for a minute first and then another person spoke for some time and
thereafter L.N. Mishra stood up to deliver his speech. They heard L.N. Mishra
speaking at the place where they were sitting. In the meanwhile, track was
cleared and Special Train moved ahead, which paved the way for many persons to
cross the track, thereby came closer to see L.N. Mishra. PW-2, A-1 and A-2
mingled with this crowd, came nearer to the Dais, and positioned themselves in
that side from which the Special Train had come. PW-2 further deposed that all
three of them (PW-2, A-1 and A-2) were at a distance of about one yard from
the Munch i.e. Rostrum. A-2 was standing ahead and on his left, stood A-1.
PW-2 also deposed that on the right side of A-2, he himself was standing in
the crowd. They stood on one side of Rostrum i.e. towards the right hand side
of L. N. Mishra. A-3 was not there at that time with them. They listened the
Minister; the Minister finished his speech and turned to descend from the
Rostrum for inaugurating Broad Gauge Line. Then A-2 took out hand grenade from
his pocket and with a Chaddar wrapped round his shoulders brought the hand
grenade up to the level of his mouth and threw it on the munch. A-2 had taken
out the pin under the cover of chaddar and dropped it in front of L.N. Mishra
and this hand grenade rolled a little distance on the Rostrum and then
exploded. PW-2 further deposed that hand grenade rolled one or two feet on the
Rostrum before it exploded and there was loud explosion.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 557 People started fleeing and they (PW-2, A-1 and A-2)
also fled along with them and PW-2 ran along with Meter Gauge Track towards
the Lahariya Sarai. At a distance of about 100 meters from the stage, he
dropped the hand grenade in between the track of Meter Gauge lest he be
detected. Then PW-2 reached the room of Girijanandan and after sometime,
Girijanandan also reached there but A-1 and A-2 did not reach there in his
presence. PW-2 waited for them for some time and then went to Muzaffarpur.
PW-2 told Girijanandan that in case A-1 and A-2 coming and inquiring about
him, Girijanandan would inform them that PW-2 had gone to Muzaffarpur. Next
day, PW-2 went to Chakia. PW-2 deposed that he was arrested on 24.07.1975
along with A-2 at Bhagalpur.
465\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 answered that in his statement under
Section 164 Cr. PC in A.N. Ray's case, he has not stated that he was in
Chakia, Narkatiaganj, Chamua, Rajgir and Chautham in July and November 1974.
He has also not stated that he met A-1 at Patna on 29.12.1974 or that A-1 told
him to make arrangement for their stay at the house of Girijanandan or their
coming to Samastipur and meeting of A-3 at Samastipur.
466\. PW-2 correctly explained that a separate case with regard to incident of
Samastipur was registered and so he did not narrate these facts in Justice
Ray's case, in his statement under Section 161 and 164 Cr. PC of that case.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 558
467\. In his further cross-examination, PW-2 replied that on 30.12.1974, from
Patna, he reached Chakia on the same Evening and stayed there even on
31.12.1974. He left Chakia on 01.01.1975 at about 08.00 or 09.00 AM and
reached Samastipur at about 01.00 PM. He met Girijanandan at about 01.30 or
02.00 PM on the same day.
468\. It is also found in his cross-examination that there were about 25 to 35
persons on the Rostrum. The train had halted at Platform No. 3, where the
Rostrum was erected. The bogy carrying the Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra halted in
front of the Rostrum itself and about 15 or 20 persons came out from that
compartment along with Sh. L.N. Mishra. He replied that he sat on a chair in
front of the Rostrum on the Platform. He could not say how many rows of chairs
were there but there were about 150 chairs on his backside and 400 or 500 in
front of him. He was standing at a distance of about 1 or 1.25 yards from the
Rostrum towards the right hand side of A-2.
The lines of cross-examination fortify the presence of PW-2 on the day of
incident along with A-2.
469\. It is also elicited that there was a big crowd and he could not remember
as to how many persons standing wearing Badges of Congress Sewa Dal. There was
distance of about 8 or 10 feet between the Rostrum and the place, where the
train carrying Sh. L.N. Mishra halted. The height of the Munch from the ground
of the Platform was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 559 up to his chest level. His own
height is 5'7". The length and breadth of the Munch would be 20 feet and 15/16
feet respectively. From its appearance, it appeared to have been made of the
bricks. He could not say whether there were wooden planks underneath the Dais.
The cross-examination reinforces that there was a Dais constructed on Platform
No. 3.
470\. It is further elicited that there were 2 or 3 ladies of 40-45 years age,
on the Dais and the ladies did not deliver any speech. In his further cross-
examination, it is elicited that only one hand grenade was thrown on the Munch
and that too by A-2. PW-2 further answered that hand grenade of A-1 remained
with A-1. All the persons on the Rostrum were standing and some were coming
down from the Munch and some were sitting behind the Minister to make way for
Minister to alight and the speech had already been finished. The hand grenade,
which was thrown, did not touch the body of any person and it fell down on the
Munch in front of Sh. L.N. Mishra. He deposed that this hand grenade moved on
to the space between the persons standing on the Dais. He saw this hand
grenade only when A-2 brought it towards his mouth and flung on the Munch. At
that time, one or two persons were standing on the left side and two or three
persons on the right side of Sh. L.N. Mishra, who was ahead of all of them and
others were behind him. The duration of the speech of Sh. L.N. Mishra was
about half an hour from 05.10 PM to 05.45 PM approximately. Sh. L.N. Mishra
was clad with a Dhoti and a buttoned up coat of darkish colour.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 560 He was bareheaded. He replied that there was a mike
on the Munch and could not say whether his speech was being tape-recorded or
not. When Sh. L.N. Mishra was delivering his speech, on the steps leading to
the Dais , a police officer was standing, who was sometimes going up and
sometimes coming down. It is also elicited that on the front row, some ladies
were sitting on the chairs and one camera man was moving on the backside of
the ladies. He answered that the steps leading to the Munch were in the
direction in which the sun rises. There were 2/3 pillows in the middle of the
Dais. At the time Sh. L.N. Mishra alighted along with others, he was ahead of
them and followed by others. Out of 40 or 50 peoples with him, only 25 or 35
persons sat on the Munch. To a question whether he had seen anybody near the
Munch with a loose jacket and a pant, to which he replied that he did not
notice although A-1 was clad in a jacket. When Sh. L.N. Mishra delivered the
speech, he was facing west. He deposed that as soon as the hand grenade
exploded, they stepped backward and thereafter they ran from that place. He
further answered that the track, where he dropped the hand grenade was at a
distance of about 100 yards from the Munch. PW-2 took it out from the thaila
and dropped it on the track. Someone presided the meeting, but he did not know
his name. No person had proposed "Vote of thanks" after conclusion of the
speech of Sh. L.N. Mishra. He replied that Sh. Mishra was garlanded, when he
reached the munch. To a question whether any person presented a charter of
demands to Sh. Mishra before the speech, to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 561 which PW-2
answered that he had seen somebody reading out from a paper, but did not
notice whether it was presented to Mr. Mishra or not. He did not remember the
name of the persons, who have garlanded Sh. Mishra. He was also garlanded,
when he came out of the train. He replied that towards Northern side of
Platform No. 1 slogans were raised against by a crowd of people against
Mishra. When the train was shunted away, all the persons from Platform No. 1
did not come to Platform No. 3 and only some persons came on the tracks after
the train was shunted out. There were iron fencing between two tracks in
between Platform No.1 and 3. There might be 50 or 100 police officers deployed
on Platform No.1 to control the demonstration. He replied that slogans were
raised once or twice, before the arrival of Sh. L.N. Mishra. Slogans were also
raised against him on his arrival. He answered that Platform No. 5 is opposite
to Platform No. 3 and there was munch between Platform No. 3 and 5. The
Platform No. 7 was away on the opposite side. Platform No. 5 was separated by
many Railway tracks.
471\. Regarding "Passes", the cross-examination of PW-2 reveals that only such
persons holding Passes, were allowed to come to Platform No. 3 and those who
did not have the Passes were stopped at Platform No. 1 and Platform No. 7. The
persons, who were holding Passes, could go near the Munch. The front row of
chairs was at a distance of 6 or 8 yards from the Dais. He answered that he
was carrying the cloth bag slung to his shoulder and moving about from 08.30
AM to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 562 04.00 PM there. He got his Pass at about 04.00 PM.
Sh. L.N. Mishra was to arrive at 01.00 PM, but at about 12.00 or 12.30 PM, it
was announced that he would arrive at about 03.00 PM. When he was standing in
the crowd on Platform No. 3, the cloth bag was on his left side towards the
front and he had kept one hand in the jhola. At that time, when his hand was
in the jhola (hand bag), he was not moving about but standing in the crowd. No
person had questioned him regarding keeping hand in the jhola. There was some
nervousness in his mind though he was trying to behave like a normal man. He
has denied the suggestion that he fell in the hands of CBI of his agreeing to
toe their line in order to save himself. He could not say whether the munch
was hollow underneath up to the ground as it was covered with a cloth. He
replied that people had started at about 10.00 AM, but they started occupying
the chairs at about 11.30 AM. When the announcement was made at about 12.30 PM
about the late arrival of the Minster, some persons dispersed and some
continued sitting on the chairs. He voluntarily stated that he left at about
12.30 PM to take his meals. He came back there at about 02.00 or 02.30 PM.
People started sitting on the chairs when he came there at about 02.30 PM. He
could not say whether the persons raising the slogans were Railway employees
or outside the public or to which party they were belonging. He was at a
distance of about 100 yards from the place where slogans were being made. The
persons, who were raising the slogans, were not moving and they were standing
at one place. The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 563 police was standing in front of
those persons, who were raising the slogans. Apart from Platform No. 1,
sometimes voice of slogans were heard from Platform No. 7. He did not see how
many persons were injured but he had heard the cries of the persons. He did
not see A-1 taking out his bomb to throw it. He also did not know in which
direction, A-1 had run away. He also did not know in which direction, A-2 had
run away as they had mingled with the people. He did not go back to look for
his companions as in the very beginning, they had decided that they would meet
at the house of Girijanandan. They did not reach there (house of Girijanandan)
and PW-2 left the house. He waited for them for half an hour or 45 minutes and
he thought that it would not be advisable for him to stay any longer. He did
not change his clothes before leaving the house of Girijanandan. It takes
about 15 minutes walk to reach the house of Girijanandan from Platform No. 3.
He did not take his meals before leaving the house of Girijanandan in that
Evening. He had returned the keys of the house to Girijanandan before leaving
the place. He had not taken away the belongings of A-1 and A-2. He had taken
away only his own articles. He further deposed that he came to know only on
02.01.1975 in the Morning, when A-1 told him that hand grenade was to be
thrown on L.N. Mishra. To a question regarding momentary training given to him
by A-1 at the house of Girijanandan, PW-2 replied that it was not a very
complicated affair and he understood upon explanation.
472\. PW-2 answered in his further cross-examination on behalf of A-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 564 3 that when A-1 asked him on 29.12.1974 to make
arrangement for stay of 2 or 3 persons in Samastipur for 01.01.1975, he got a
hint that as L.N. Mishra was coming to Samastipur on 02.01.1975 they might
have to do something in this regard. He got this hint at Ashok Lodge at Patna.
Regarding throwing of hand grenade on L.N. Mishra, it came to his knowledge
only in the morning of 02.01.1975. He has denied the suggestion that he became
an approver under fear and he voluntarily stated that only tape-recorded
statement was given by him under fear.
473\. PW-2 further replied that on 02.01.1975 in the Morning, A-1 told them
that L.N. Mishra was coming and he was Mahapapi, and an obstacle for the
release of their cult head. It is further elicited that A-1 told them that
Mishra was to be liquidated to shake the government and get the Baba released.
In the cross-examination of this witness at the hands of A-3 also, the
detailed description of the events sworn to by this witness in his chief and
further got confirmed in the cross- examination at the hands of other accused
is repeatedly got elicited and the entire cross-examination of this witness by
A-3 is nothing but the replica of the same. PW-2 has admitted the suggestion
of the A- 3 at Page No. 301 that A-1 and A-2 were present on Platform No. 3 as
they got admission, since they were having passes with them. The same reads as
under: -
Ans. Sometime I would also be going ahead of the people and look towards
Santoshanand and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 565 Sudevanand, who were sitting on Platform
No. 3 on chairs. It is correct that they had occupied chairs soon after they
got admitted into Platform No. 3 as they had Passes with them.
There was no crowd on Platform No. 3 except the assemblage of the persons, who
had occupied seats after entering on the basis of the passes". My Ld.
Predecessor had also taken judicial note of during the recording of evidence
of this fact. Therefore, it would be only repetitive rhetoric hence the same
is not again reproduced. At Page No. 289 of his cross-examination, the Ld.
Defence Counsel for A-3, an important suggestion is given as under: -
> "Q. Is it that Sudevanand and Santoshanand also ran along with you?
> Ans. They were with me only when I was stepping backward but when I left
> from the place, I do not know in which direction Santoshanand and Sudevanand
> went."
(This interrogation with this suggestion implies in itself admission of the
presence of accused A-1, A-2 and PW-2 at the spot).
474\. It is also got elicited that no splinter of the hand grenade fell on
PW-2. He has denied the suggestion that since no splinter struck him, he was
not present at the spot.
In his further cross-examination, PW-2 replied that all of them CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 566 were present in the clothes of a common man. He volunteered that
he had already described as to how they had discarded their saffron robes and
long hairs.
Even the purchase of clothe-pin is got confirmed in the cross- examination.
PW-2 replied that the shop from which he purchased the pin, was across the
road and he paid five or ten paisa, for which he had given him four or five
pins.
475\. Other details got elicited only reaffirms that PW-2 was present and the
incident happened as happened, particularly, the overt acts of A-2 hurling the
hand grenade at the Dais, the commotion thereafter in presence of PW-2, A-1
also ready with their ammunition, which were not used and the hand grenade
hurled by A-2 got exploded and that PW-2, A-1 and A-2 ran away mingling in the
crowd, which went helter-skelter.
It is vital to note in cross-examination of PW-2, it is elicited by A-3 that
they (PW-2, A-1 and A-2) killed L.N. Mishra and that he was not aware whether
Yashpal Kapoor visited Muzaffarpur or not.
476\. I have very carefully scrutinized the deposition of PW-2 and despite his
lengthy cross-examination by the defence, they could not discredit his
assertion in his examination-in-chief. Defence could not demolish that on
29.12.1974 in the Ashok Lodge/Ashok Niketan, Patna, PW-2 was brought by A-2,
where A-1 directed him to arrange stay of 2/3 persons in Samastipur on
01.01.1975. It is also CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 567 unchallenged that PW-2 was asked
to meet them at the Railway Station, Samastipur on 01.01.1975 at about 04.00
or 05.00 PM. Defence could not belie that about 12.00 Noon, A-1 and A-2 were
found sitting on the chairs at Platform No. 3 behind A-3 or that A-3 was
talking to them by turning his face. Defence has also not derided that A-1 at
about 02.00 or 02.30 PM informed PW-2 that A-3 had arranged "Passes" for them.
Defence could not demolish the facts spoken that in this second session, A-1
and A-2 occupied chairs a little behind the middle row at the venue and their
presence throughout till the explosion of hand grenade.
The cross-examination does not go to destabilize the version of PW-2 that
after the conclusion of the speech, A-2 took out the hand grenade, flung on
the Dais in front of Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra and it got exploded or
that thereafter they all fled from the site.
477\. The Ld. Defence Counsel has pointed out that PW-2 has made improvements
in his statement as he did not state in his previous statement under Section
164 Cr. PC in A.N. Ray's case that he met A-1 at Patna on 29.12.1974 or that
A-1 told him to make arrangement for their stay at the house of Girijanandan
or their coming to Samastipur and meeting of A-3 at Samastipur. Here it is to
be noted that pertaining to the attack on the former Chief Justice of India
Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Ray, a case under Section 307 IPC was registered and
the facts of the present case were not to be narrated.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 568
478\. However, in the said case, CBI court has held out a conviction against
A-1, A-2 and A-3. The same was appealed by all the accused. The Hon'ble High
Court in the very matter reported as MANU/DE/1873/2014 in the matter of
Santoshanand Avdoot Vs. State had the following to observe: -
> "134. I have minutely scrutinized the evidence of PW-Vikram and the
> corroborative evidence discussed in detail above and find no substance in
> the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that the testimony
> of PW-Vikram has not been corroborated in material particulars.
> .....................................The statement of PW-1 is vivid in
> explanation and inspires full confidence of the court.
> ...................................... The statement of approver inspires
> confidence including the conspiracy part which gets full support from the
> narration of the occurrence given by several other impartial witnesses.
> ........................................."
479\. This court is also of the firm view that the testimony of PW-2, which
withstood bone testing, chilling lengthy and repetitive cross- examination,
does not suffer from any incoherence, fallibility, doubts and inconsistencies
and the same proves all the material particulars expected of in this case.
PW-2 has also narrated all the facts in minute details, which cannot be termed
as tutored or suffering from any CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 569 malice. The same also
does not suffer from any enmity towards the accused since PW-2 himself was one
of the avowed Anand Margi and took active part in the conspiracy and the
execution of its objective. Therefore, the other detailed cross-examination,
which is only go-over and hovering around the same again and again does not go
to discredit the witness, but on the other hand reaffirms and fortifies the
examination-in-chief.
At one point, in his cross-examination, it is elicited that on the Dais Sh.
L.N. Mishra was garlanded and someone has presented him a "Charter of Demand".
This has been corroborated by PW-57 Sh. Brij Mohan Sharma, an independent
witness, who has testified that he garlanded the Minister and wanted to
present him a "Maanpatra".
480\. It has come in the testimony of PW-2 that A-2 told him that A-3 had come
by bus from Muzaffarpur to Samastipur along with A-1 and A-2. It has further
come in his evidence that A-3 had kept his luggage in the first class waiting
room at the Railway Station and that A-3 had gone to meet one of his friends,
A-1 was keeping watch on his luggage. The testimony of PW-2 further reveal
that he saw A-3 sitting on a chair in the row ahead towards the Dais, and
talking to them by turning his face towards them. It is further noticed from
the testimony of PW-2 that at about 2 or 2.30 PM, when they came back to the
Railway Station, A-1 informed PW-2 about making of arrangements of their entry
to the venue by A-3. To corroborate this deposition of approver PW-2, the
prosecution has examined PW-5 Sh. Vishwanath CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 570 Thakur and
PW-6 Sh. Virender Kumar Ojha. Therefore, it is necessary to refer the
testimony of PW-5 and PW-6.
481\. PW-5 deposed that he was working as Sub-Inspector, RPF since 1963 and
was transferred as Crime Reader to ASO Samastipur. He knew PW-6. They had
joined the Training Center at Lucknow and thereafter they were posted together
at Gorakhpur. He deposed that on 01.1.1975, PW-6 was posted as Sub-Inspector
(Prosecution) at Samastipur. On that day, he along with PW-6 at about 5:00 PM
left their office. Since it was the New Year's Day, PW-6 offered a cup of tea
at his residence and he went there. At that time one person, who disclosed his
name as Ranjan Dwivedi, came there. (The witness has correctly identified the
A-3 in the court). PW-6 found it difficult to identify him, upon which A-3
introduced himself as practicing as Advocate in Supreme Court. Since A-3 was
not having any luggage with him, on asking of PW-6, A-3 told PW-6 that he came
from Sitamarhi after halting at Muzaffarpur, his Bhabhi (brother's wife) and
mother were coming from Sitamarhi and he wanted train Reservation for them for
Delhi. On asking of PW-6, A-3 told him that his luggage was in the first class
waiting room at Samastipur Railway Station and his other friends in the
waiting room were looking after his luggage. They had tea together in the
quarters of PW-6 at that time and during conversation, A-3 asked PW-6 whether
he knew Sahai family since Mr. Sahai had expired and further said Mr. Sahai
was the father-in-law of one of his friends. PW-6 told A-3 that the family of
Mr. Sahai was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 571 residing in his neighborhood, upon which
said accused expressed his desire to visit their house for condolence.
Subsequently, all the three went together to the house of Mr. Sahai for
offering condolence and thereafter all the three left for Samastipur Railway
Station to meet Bhabhi and mother of the A-3.
482\. PW-5 deposed that on the way, A-3 told PW-6 that his luggage is being
looked after by his trusted friends who were known to him from Delhi and
accompanied him by bus from Muzaffarpur. They then reached first-class waiting
room at Samastipur Railway Station and there they met one friend of A-3, who
was introduced by A-3 to them as Santoshanand, present in the court. (The
witness has correctly identified the accused Santoshanand in the court). He
deposed that on that day, A-1 was wearing a jacket and a pant though in the
court he was in saffron robes. At that time, A-1 was neither sporting a beard
nor wearing a turban, as is found in the court. Santoshanand was having short
hair and wearing a hearing aid. Thereafter, A-3 asked A- 1 "WOH KAHAN GAYE"
(where A-2 had gone), to which A-1 replied that he had just gone outside and
would come back in no time. Then A-1 asked A-3 as to where he got delayed and
then PW-6 asked A-1 as to where they were to go to which A-1 replied that they
were to go towards Barauni side on the next Morning. Meanwhile, it was
reported that the train carrying Bhabhi and mother of A-3 was running late.
Since it was already past 8:00 PM, PW-5 was getting late and left for his
residence.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 572
483\. In his cross-examination, PW-5 replied that he left Railway Station
Samastipur at about 08.05 or 08.10 PM leaving A-3 and PW-6 there. He answered
that in first class waiting room, one register is maintained, in which the
person staying there has to enter his name and other particulars including the
number of the Railway Ticket. However, on that day, he did not notice that
register in the waiting room. He noticed the attendant in the waiting room. He
could not recollect the appearance or age of the attendant or what dress he
was wearing or whether he was wearing any hearing aid or wearing any cap or
jacket or any turban. He testified that the said waiting room was for men. The
ladies first class waiting room was at a distance of five or six yards from
the gents' waiting room. He denied the suggestion of the defence that he did
not accompany PW-6 to his house on 01.01.1975 while returning from his office.
He stayed at PW-6's quarters on that Evening for about 25 or 30 minutes. When,
A-3 reached the quarters, he and PW-6 were sitting in the lawns of the
quarters and there was twilight. He could identify any person seen in that
twilight. By the time, A-3 reached, the tea was not being served. The tea was
served to all of them about four or five minutes of arrival of A-3 there. A-3
stayed there with them at the house of PW-6 for about ten or twelve minutes
and thereafter they all three went to house of Mr. Sahai. He was hearing the
conversation between PW-6 and A-
3\. PW-5 deposed that he told in his previous statement that A-1 was wearing
jacket and pant and was introduced to PW-6 by A-3. He did CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 573
not tell the colour or features or height of A-1 in his previous statement. He
did not state in his previous statement that A-1 was having short hair and
beard shaved.
484\. From the scrutiny of deposition of PW-5, it is found that the same could
not be discredited at all by the defence including A-1 and A-3. They have not
demolished the assertion of PW-5 that A-3 told PW-6 in his presence that his
friends who were looking after his luggage in the waiting room, were reliable
and known to him from Delhi, and came with him from Muzaffarpur by bus. They
failed to deride the deposition of the witness on the fact that A-3 introduced
A- 1 to PW-6 in his presence. Accused further failed to belie the say of PW-5
that A-1 was donning a pant and jacket and wearing a hearing aid. In his
cross-examination, he admitted the suggestion of the defence that after
01.1.1975, he has seen A-1 for the first time in the court on the date of his
deposition. Therefore, in a way accused persons have admitted that A-1 was
with A-3 on 01.1.1975 at Samastipur Railway Station and was introduced to PW-5
by A-3. The line of cross-examination does not suggest that PW-5 has any
enmity with any of the accused persons. PW-5 is a Government servant and an
independent witness. There is no reason to discard the testimony of PW-5,
which is found trustworthy and inspiring confidence. The testimony of PW-2
gets corroborated in material particulars by the deposition of PW-5 and of
PW-6, which is being discussed herein after.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 574
485\. PW-6 deposed that he was Sub-Inspector (Prosecution) at Samastipur at
the relevant time. He knew A-3, who is brother of the wife of his distant
relative Sh. R. Chaubey and could identify him. However, A-3 was not present
in the court on the day of deposition being exempted. He deposed that on
01.01.1975, A-3 came to his quarters at about 5.30 PM at Samastipur. At that
time, PW-5 was sitting with him and PW-6 was trying to recollect his past
acquaintance with A-3 and in the meanwhile A-3 introduced himself by saying
that he was Ranjan Dwivedi, Advocate, Supreme Court. On his asking, A-3 told
him that he was coming from Sitamarhi by bus after halting at Muzaffarpur and
he had arrived by bus from Muzaffarpur and his Bhabhi and mother would reach
Samastipur by train from Sitamarhi and he wanted Railway Reservation for
himself, his Bhabhi and mother for Delhi. Then they had tea together. PW-6
deposed that he asked A-3 as to where his luggage was and he told him that the
same was in first class waiting room at Samastipur Railway Station and was
being looked after by his friends. A-3 asked PW-6 whether he was acquainted
with Sahai family. A-3 also told PW-6 that Mr. Sahai, father-in-law of his
friend Vinay, had died and he wanted to offer condolence to the bereaved
family. PW-6 told A-3 that Sahai family was residing in their neighborhood and
he agreed to accompany A-3 to Sahai's house. Then all the three went to the
house of Mr. Sahai and conveyed their condolences and spent about 45 minutes.
From there they all three went to Railway Station, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 575
Samastipur for arranging requested reservation of A-3. On the way to Railway
Station, he enquired from accused Ranjan Dwivedi about his friends by telling
him that sometimes some friends might play mischief with the luggage, and on
this accused Ranjan Dwivedi informed him that his friends were from Delhi and
reliable and they had travelled together in the bus from Muzaffarpur. They
reached first class waiting room, Samastipur Railway Station and found one
friend of A-3 guarding the luggage. There, A-3 introduced them to that friend
as his relative and A-3 introduced his friend as Mr. Santoshanand. He can
identify that friend of A-3. (The witness identified the accused Santoshanand
present in the court, who was introduced to them by Ranjan Dwivedi as his
friend). He further testified that at that time, A-1 was wearing a jacket and
a pant and he was clean-shaven and putting a hearing aid and there was a
little baldness in the center of his head. When A-3 enquired from A-1 as to
where his other friend had gone, A-1 informed A-3 that he (other friend i.e.
Sudevanand) had gone outside and A-1 asked A-3 as to where he got delayed.
PW-6 asked A-1 as to where he wanted to go and A-1 informed him that he wanted
to go to Barauni next Morning. PW-6 deposed that at about 08.15 PM, PW-5 left
the Railway Station. Thereafter, PW-6 and A-3 went to Railway Reservation
Counter. PW-6 asked the clerk to arrange for three berths for his friend for
Delhi. The clerk informed him that he was closing Counter for the night and
promised to do next morning. PW-6 deposed that mother and Bhabhi CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 576 of A-3 arrived at about 12.00 midnight or 01.00 AM and they
received them at Platform No. 4. The mother and Bhabhi of A-3 were taken to
first class ladies waiting room and then the luggage of A-3 was shifted from
the gents' waiting room to ladies waiting room. While leaving the Railway
Station, PW-6 told A-3 that in case of any problem in accommodation for the
night in the waiting room, he might come to his place. PW-6 deposed that
mother and Bhabhi of A-3 stayed in the ladies waiting room and at about 12.30
AM or 12.45 AM, A-3 came to his quarters and told him that he would like to
stay with them as there was no proper accommodation for him in the waiting
room.
486\. PW-6 further deposed that on 02.01.1975, he and A-3 reached the Railway
Station, Samastipur at about 10.00 AM. He first went to the ladies waiting
room and exchanged greetings there with the mother and Bhabhi of A-3. From
there both of them went to Reservation Counter. The clerk, who met him last
night, was not at the Counter and PW-6 asked A-3 to wait for him, as PW-6 was
to go to the court on his duty. PW-6 returned there by 11.30 AM or 12.00 Noon,
met A- 3 with his friend A-1 and another at Platform No. 1, who was introduced
to him as Sudevanand (The witness has correctly identified the accused
Sudevanand also present in the court). He deposed that he asked A-1 as to how
he was still there as on the previous night A-1 disclosed that he would leave
for Barauni early in the Morning and A- 1 told PW-6 that they had stayed back
to see the function. PW-6 got Reservation for A-3, his mother and Bhabhi for
the train to go to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 577 Delhi. He deposed that the
application for reservation was filled up by A-3 in his presence.
487\. I have perused the Requisition Slip Ex.PW-6/A, which is available in
Folder R-13. As per this Requisition Form for reserved accommodation
Ex.PW-6/A, three berths for 3rd class in 85-UP Assam Mail for 02.1.1975 from
Samastipur to New Delhi were booked by R. Dwivedi c/o V.K. Ojha, PP RPF SPS,
at 11.30 AM in the name of R. Dwivedi, m/o R. Dwivedi and Tara Devi. The
portion Q-6 is questioned writing of accused Ranjan Dwivedi, which was later
on admitted by him. Mentioning of address of PW-6 by the accused Ranjan
Dwivedi in the Requisition Slip Ex.PW-6/A further corroborates the testimony
of PW-6 that it is PW-6, who got the reservation of accused Ranjan Dwivedi,
his mother and Bhabhi for the train going to Delhi and the Reservation Slip
was filled up by accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his presence.
488\. PW-6 further deposed that there was one Dais (Munch) fixed on the
Platform No. 3 and he along with A-3 proceeded towards it. When they reached
there, PW-6 noticed that A-1 and A-2 were already present there and on the
rear seat, PW-6 and A-3 sat in the one row and behind them A-1 and A-2 were
already seated. One Youth Congress worker was distributing some "cards"
("badges") and PW-6 and A-3 proceeded towards that worker to collect badges
from him. It is also found in his testimony that the said worker told PW-6 for
a CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 578 railway employee, no badge is necessary. He further
deposed that A-3 demanded three badges from that worker, who gave three badges
and A-3 handed over each Badge to A-1 and A-2 and kept 3rd one for himself. At
about 12.30 PM, there was an announcement that the Minister's train would be
reaching late and crowd started melting. PW-6 started roaming about on
Platform No. 3. After sometime, the two friends of A-3 went away for meals. At
about 3.30 PM, PW-6 and A-3 sat there and said two friends of A-3 were already
sitting behind them. At about 04.00 PM, PW-6 and A-3 left the Platform No. 3
and from there, he went to waiting room and collected the mother and Bhabhi of
A-3 as time for their train was drawing near. On Platform No.7, mother, Bhabhi
of A-3 and Ranjan Dwivedi himself boarded the train for Delhi and he did not
go to Platform No. 3. After seeing the Badge Ex.P-8, he testified that the
badges obtained by A-3 from Congress worker, were of similar type.
489\. This Badge of Congress Sewa Dal is available in Folder R-4. The front
side of the badge Ex.P-8 reads as under:-

काँ ेस सेवा दल सम तीपुर
490\. In the cross-examination on behalf of A-3, PW-6 answered that Sh. R.
Chaubey (DW-4) is a cousin of a son of his maternal uncle. He replied that
prior to 01.01.1975, he had seen A-3 only once for a few minutes and that is
why he could not immediately place him on 01.01.1975, when he came to him.
Prior to 01.01.1975, he met A-3 only once in Delhi in the month of June/July
1974, during the pleasure trip with his family to Delhi. He admitted that his
stay with Sh. R. Chaubey for 2 or 3 days, which was at Old Willington Camp,
Race Course Road, Air Force Quarters, New Delhi. He denied the suggestion that
at that time A-3 was also staying in the quarter of Sh. Chaubey. During such
stay, once at about 08.00 AM, A-3 reached there and at that time Sh. Chaubey
introduced A-3 to him as his brother-in-law (Sister's husband). He has denied
the suggestion that PW-6 brought his wife for medical check-up at All India
Institute of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 580 Medical Sciences, New Delhi. It is also
elicited that according to rules, first class waiting room can be used only by
the passengers having first class tickets. The witness explained that
Samastipur being small station, first class waiting room might be used for
two-three hours even by second-class passengers during day time. He also
admitted the suggestion that in Samastipur, person not having any Railway
Ticket was also permitted into the first class waiting room, with the consent
of the attendant. He admitted that one register is maintained there. The
passengers in the waiting room make entries, ticket number and destination. On
01.01.1975, he noticed that attendant outside the first class gents' waiting
room. He does not know the name of that attendant. In the waiting room, he
found one hold-all and one attaché. It is elicited that this witness along
with A-3 and PW-5 were there for some time. A-3 engaged a porter for shifting
the luggage. He has denied the suggestion of A-3 that he had some litigation
with his brother-in-law Sh. Chaubey.
491\. The A-1 and A-2 cross-examined PW-6 and got elicited that while in
Delhi, PW-6 visited all the sightseeing places and neither Chaubey nor A-3
accompanied him and his family. PW-6 visited Agra and Mathura with his family,
but they did not stay either at Agra or at Mathura during night; then
proceeded to Lucknow. He has also denied the suggestion that primary purpose
of visit to Delhi at that time was to get medical check-up of his wife at All
India Institute of Medical Sciences. He also denied the suggestion that Mr.
Chaubey CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 581 told him that he could talk to A-3 as he might
be knowing somebody in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, since he was a
practicing Advocate. He has also denied the suggestion that A-3 gave a cold
shoulder to him, which was not liked by him. He also denied the suggestion
that out of disgust for not helping him, PW-6 left the house of Mr. Chaubey
with a grudge that A-3 did not help him deliberately. PW-6 replied that at
that time, he was the only Railway Prosecutor at Samastipur. He has denied the
suggestion that he readily agreed to become a witness in this case because of
strained relations with A-3 and his brother-in-law Sh. Chaubey. He has denied
the suggestion that A-3 never met him on 02.01.1975. He also denied the
suggestion that he never arranged Railway Reservation for A-3 as stated. At
Page No. 571 of his cross-examination, PW-6 has admitted the suggestion of
accused persons, which reads as under: -
> "It is correct that after 2.1.75, he saw accd. Santoshanand only in this
> court when I came to give my statement."
He has denied the suggestion that Santoshanand and Sudevanand were not there
on 02.01.1975 or that he has made a false statement under the pressure of
police and promise of promotion and cash rewards.
492\. Accused No. 7 got elicited from PW-6 that in his police statement he
mentioned that on 01.01.1975, having arranged Railway Reservation for Ranjan
Dwivedi, his mother and wife for 02.01.1975. He explained that he meant that
the seats were assured on 01.01.1975.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 582 He replied that it is not necessary to mention the
time of reservation in the requisition slip. At Page No. 577, he admitted the
suggestion of accused persons about introduction of Santoshanand and
Sudevanand to him by Ranjan Dwivedi and the suggestion reads as under: -
> "It is correct that when accused Ranjan Dwivedi accused introduced
> Santoshanand and Sudevanand to me, I could never anticipate that I might be
> required to give evidence in that connection in court or to give out the
> names. I, however remember those names"
Strangely, A-7 had also got elicited the name of Reservation clerk and PW-6
named him as Mitra Dada. He went to the court with the hope that Mitra Dada
would be coming back to the reservation counter by that time he returns from
the court. However, one Mr. Ghai was present at the Reservation Counter on
02.01.1975, when he initially went there. On 01.01.1975, Mitra Dada had
assured him that he would be reaching Reservation Counter even on 02.01.1975
due to the proposed function. When he returned from the court, PW-6 asked A-3
whether he got the Reservation, to which A-3 replied that he was waiting for
PW-6. He told Mr. Ghai that Mitra Dada had assured him of Reservation and on
telling him, he immediately made the reservation. He denied the suggestion
that reservation was not made in his presence. He also denied the suggestion
that Sudevanand and Santoshanand never met him on the Railway Station on
01.01.1975 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 583 and 02.01.1975. He could not say whether the
Passes/Badges were given to A-3 due to his influence or that of A-3. He also
deposed that when they took their seats at about 03.30 PM, he noticed that
Sudevanand and Santoshanand having put these passes on their chest with the
help of pins. He also noticed that A-3 had not fixed up that pass on his
person. He had seen about 20/25 persons, who had similarly tagged the passes
on their person but all the persons have not fixed up. He replied that the
train in which mother and Bhabhi of A-3 went to Delhi left Samastipur Railway
Station on 2.1.1975 at about 4.50 PM. At about 04.00 PM, A-3 pointed out to
him that the train in which he, his mother and Bhabhi were to go to Delhi, was
being placed at the Platform and so at his instance, they proceeded to the
waiting room and from there to the platform for boarding the train.
493\. Further, this fact is corroborated by the statement of A-3 himself in
his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, who admitted that he visited the house
of PW-6 on 01.01.1975 and requested him to arrange reservations for Delhi. He
admits having told PW-6 that he had come from Muzaffarpur and wanted the
reservation for himself, his mother and Bhabhi and that was the only train
connecting Delhi from his native place. He also admitted visiting Sahai Family
with PW-5 and PW-6 for condolence. He also admitted that the train, by which
his Bhabhi and mother were to come, was running late and at about 8.00 PM,
PW-5 left for his residence. He also admitted that his CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 584
Bhabhi and mother reached at about 12 midnight or 01.00 AM and taken to first
class ladies waiting room.
494\. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati, Advocate that the
story of the prosecution is not believable as to why A-3 would introduce A-1
and A-2 to PW-6 with their names, when they were to execute the conspiracy by
throwing hand grenade on Sh. L.N. Mishra. She further argued that in his
statement before the police, PW-6 has stated that he had arranged Reservation
for A-3 and his mother and Bhabhi on 01.01.1975, whereas the Requisition Slip
speaks of Reservation on 02.01.1975. The A-3 as well as Ms. Sima Gulati argued
that prosecution had not seized the Register kept at the first class waiting
room at the Railway Station, Samastipur to show that A- 3 kept his luggage
there under the watch of A-1 and A-2 and the prosecution has not examined the
attendant of the first class waiting room to depose that he had seen A-1 and
A-2 there. Ld. Defence counsel vehemently argued that as per the case of the
prosecution, PW-5 has left the Railway Station at 08.30 PM and at the same
time A-1 and A-2 along with the PW-2 have left the Railway Station and that
PW-6 and A-3 went to Platform No. 4 to receive the mother and Bhabhi of A-3,
who had arrived by 12.00 Night or 01.00 AM from Sitamarhi and in such a
situation it is not coming in the evidence of PW-6 and in chain of
circumstances as to who was taking care of the luggage in the first class
waiting room.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 585
495\. I have scrutinized the deposition of PW-6. This witness has not been
discredited in any manner by the defence. In the cross- examination, the visit
of A-3 to the quarters of PW-6 with a request for Reservation for him, his
mother and Bhabhi on 01.01.1975, the presence of PW-5 is never demolished. The
parleys among A-3, PW- 5 and PW-6 are reiterated in the cross-examination
including as to who was guarding the luggage of A-3 and arrival of A-3 in the
company of A-1 and A-2 from Muzaffarpur by bus. They have also not discredited
his testimony about the competency of PW-6 in identifying A-1, A-2 and A-3.
The presence of A-1 to A-3 at the venue of the Railway Station, Samastipur is
also not demolished along with their procurement of Passes by A-3. The
identification of A-1 and A- 2 by this witness is also not derided and their
description on a day prior to the incident and on the date of incident is
never shattered in the cross-examination.
The Railway Reservation Requisition Slip Ex.PW-6/A speaks for itself. The
address given by A-3 is that of PW-6 in it and it is found written thereon by
A-3 as "R. Dwivedi c/o V.K. Ojha, PP RPF SPS". This documentary evidence
coupled with the oral testimony of PW-6 lends credence to the version of
prosecution.
496\. I have dealt with the Requisition Slip in subsequent paragraphs, which
has been proved to be in the handwriting and signatures of A-3, who had later
on admitted the same. The defence who contended that there was no mode of
entry into the venue by the Passes, have CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 586 themselves got
produced a similar Badge/Pass Ex.PW-57/DA from an independent witness Sh. Brij
Mohan Sharma in his cross examination and got it exhibited. PW-57 Sh. Brij
Mohan Sharma has categorically stated that such Badges were issued to him and
his eight companions by the Congress worker on the date of function. I have
elaborated the testimony of PW-57 in the subsequent part of the judgment. This
corroborates the testimony of approver PW-2 and PW-6 that A-3 had arranged
Passes/Badges for him and his co-conspirators.
497\. The malice attributed by the accused to the evidence of PW-6 is that
PW-6 was dissatisfied with A-3 in not arranging the medical aid for the wife
of PW-6 when he visited Delhi. PW-6 has denied a suggestion that he visited
Delhi in June or July 1974 for treatment of his wife at All India Institute of
Medical Sciences. He further denied that A-3 did not accompany him, and for
that reason he had a grudge with him. He also denied the suggestion that PW-6
had some litigation with the brother-in-law of A-3 namely Mr. Chaubey (DW-
4). PW-6 had already explained that he had come to Delhi with his family for a
pleasure trip and had gone to Mathura, Agra and Lucknow also. Had his wife
been ill or suffering from serious problem, PW-6 would have never ventured to
go to several places apart from Delhi sightseeing. The defence failed to
indicate particulars of the litigation, which PW-6 allegedly had with DW-4 Sh.
Chaubey. Moreover, even DW-4 Sh. Chaubey, whose testimony has been dealt by me
in the subsequent paragraphs of this judgment, has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 587 also
not testified that he had any litigation with PW-6 or that PW-6 has any grudge
with him or A-3. The argument of accused Ranjan Dwivedi and Ld. Defence
Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati that the prosecution has not explained as to in whose
custody the luggage of Ranjan Dwivedi remained after accused Santoshanand and
Sudevanand left at about 08.30 PM and around same time, PW-5 has left
Samastipur Railway Station and Ranjan Dwivedi along with PW-6 admittedly went
to receive the mother and Bhabhi of accused Ranjan Dwivedi at Platform No. 4.
The luggage of Ranjan Dwivedi was not the material object as admittedly there
is no allegation that Ranjan Dwivedi brought any arms and ammunitions. In view
of the overwhelming evidence of PW-2 corroborated by PW-5 and PW-6, it is
obvious that Ranjan Dwivedi was spotted in the company of accused Santoshanand
and Sudevanand on 01.01.1975 and 02.01.1975. The argument of the Ld. Counsel
for the defence falls to the ground in the backdrop of the clear cut evidence
presented through PW-6, who had explained the situation in the very cross-
examination that the luggage of A-3 was shifted with the help of a porter.
498\. This court cannot be oblivious of the fact that PW-6 has been the
exclusive Public Prosecutor of Railway at Samastipur and accused Ranjan
Dwivedi must have availed of the clout of PW-6, when he approached him for
Railway Reservation on 01.01.1975. Further, this is not the fact in issue when
Ranjan Dwivedi has not disputed of having kept his luggage in the first class
waiting room. So far as the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 588 register of first class
waiting room is concerned, PW-6 has admitted the suggestion of the defence
that in Samastipur, person not having any Railway Ticket could also use first
class waiting room and such users could be there with the consent of the
attendant of that waiting room. Further, the defence themselves got an answer
in their cross- examination from PW-6 to a suggestion that "It is correct that
after 2.1.75, he saw accused Santoshanand only in this court when I came to
give my statement" and "It is correct that when accused Ranjan Dwivedi accused
introduced Santoshanand and Sudevanand to me, I could never anticipate that I
might be required to give evidence in that connection in court or to give out
the names. I, however remember those names". In view of this discussion, I
find that the testimony of PW-6 is consistently trustworthy and could not be
discredited by the defence. PW-6 has also corroborated the testimony of the
approver PW-2 that he was informed by Sudevanand about the arrival of Ranjan
Dwivedi along with him and Santoshanand by bus from Muzaffarpur and that he
had seen accused Ranjan Dwivedi sitting on the chair ahead of Santoshanand and
Sudevanand and talking to them by turning his face towards them and that
Sudevanand informed him that accused Ranjan Dwivedi had arranged entry passes
for them. Therefore, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt that on 01.01.1975, A-3 came to Samastipur along with A-1 and
A-2 by bus from Muzaffarpur and next day A-3 arranged entry
Passes/Badges/Cards for their safe entry to the venue to be held CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 589 on 02.01.1975. The Passes are also got exhibited by the accused
themselves in the cross-examination of PW-57. These facts are enough to prove
that A-3 had also joined the criminal conspiracy, initially hatched at the
house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan in October 1973. I had discussed the
scribblings of Ranjan Dwivedi's diaries in the subsequent paragraphs, which
further establishes that he was part of the conspiracy for killing Sh. L.N.
Mishra.
499\. The defence has argued that apart from PW-2 none having seen the hurling
of hand grenade by A-2 on the Dais becomes highly improbable. The consistent
testimony of approver PW-2, which was also upheld by our Hon'ble High Court in
MANU/DE/1873/2014 (supra) cannot be thrown overboard on the point that there
are no other eye witnesses. This court is aware that the present case is based
on criminal conspiracy for which seldom an eye witness crops up but to be
gathered from other circumstantial evidence and especially if it is based on
the statement of an approver only the material particulars are to be
corroborated. It is profitable to quote the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarwan
Singh Rattan Singh's case (supra) which laid down:
> "It would not be right that expect that such independent corroboration
> should cover the whole of the prosecution story or even all the material
> particulars. If such a view is adopted it would render the evidence of the
> accomplice wholly CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
> December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 590 superfluous. Moreover, as

> necessary that the corroboration should confirm all the circumstances of the

> as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohd. Husain Umar Kochra's case
> (supra).
The argument that the accused Ranjan Dwivedi could have not introduced other
two accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand to PW-6 as queer some and be not
believed is only a hypothesis - which gets belied by cogent evidence of PW-2,
PW-5 and PW-6 as discussed above. The other aspect regarding the non-
specifying the correct date before police and non-seizure of register of
waiting room - pale into insignificance in the backdrop of A-3 not repudiating
the reservation slip and keeping of his luggage in the first class gents'
waiting room and its subsequent shifting to ladies waiting room through a
porter.
500\. Therefore, this court comes to the irresistible conclusion that the
prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that on 02.01.1975,
accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi visited the scene of
occurrence in the first session and remained there up to 12.30 PM, whereas the
approver Vikram continued to wait for CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 591 signal from
accused Santoshanand at Platform No. 1. There A-3 obtained three badges/passes
from a Youth Congress Worker and gave one each to A-1and A-2 and kept third
with him. At about 12.30 PM, there was an announcement that the Minister's
train would be reaching late. At about 3.30 PM, PW-6 and A-3 sat there again
and A-1and A-2 were already sitting behind them. The accused A-3 along with
PW-6 had left the Dais at about 04.00 PM, since A-3 was to catch the train
along with his mother and Bhabhi bound for Delhi and in the meanwhile accused
Sudevanand with a Badge/Pass pinned on his chest, went to Platform No. 1 and
gave the other badge/pass to PW-2, who got it pinned by buying a pin from
outside and came to Platform No. 3. All these three persons i.e. Santoshanand,
Sudevanand and approver PW-2 occupied the seats and in the meanwhile, track
was cleared as Special Train moved ahead. Resultantly, many persons crossed
the railway track in order to come closer to see L.N. Mishra. Availing of this
opportunity, Santoshanand, Sudevanand and PW-2 also mingled with them, came
nearer to the Dais at a distance of about one yard, and positioned themselves
in that side from which the Special Train had come. As soon as, Sh. L.N.
Mishra finished his speech and turned in order to descend from the Rostrum for
the purposes of inaugurating Broad Gauge Line, Sudevanand took out hand
grenade from his pocket and under the cover of Chaddar brought it to the level
of his mouth and taken out the pin and dropped/threw it on the munch, in front
of L.N. Mishra and this hand grenade rolled a CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 592 little
distance of one or two feet on the Rostrum and then exploded. As a result,
there was loud explosion and like the people, Sudevanand fled from there. PW-2
fled along with Meter Gauge Track towards the Lahariya Sarai over which the
Special Train had brought L.N. Mishra and at a distance of about 100 meters
from the stage, he dropped the hand grenade in between the track of Meter
Gauge lest he be detected. A-1 also has also run away from the spot.
45) Registration of FIR on the incident at Railway Station.
501\. PW-86 Sh. Rameshwar Sain, Incharge PS GRP, Samastipur deposed that on
02.01.1975, received writing Ex.PW-65/B at 08.00 PM. He recorded his
endorsement Ex.PW-86/A on the rukka Ex.PW- 65/B with his signatures. First
Information Report No. 1/75 at Ex.PW- 86/B was written by him and bears his
signatures. The investigation of this case was entrusted to Deputy SP Sh.
Shashi Kumar Narain Singh. (The original writing/rukka Ex.PW-65/B is available
in Folder R-7. Endorsement Ex.PW-86/A is made on the backside of Ex.PW- 65/B.
FIR Ex.PW-86/B is available in Folder R-7. The FIR No.1 dated 02.01.1975 was
registered u/s 3/4 Explosive Substance Act, 120-B/307 of IPC at GRP,
Samastipur Railway Station). In his cross- examination, it is found that the
original writing (Ex.PW-65/B) with his endorsement Ex.PW-86/A was sent to
Jurisdictional Magistrate on the very day through a constable with a peon
book. Nothing material comes out in his cross-examination to suggest that he
has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 593 not received the information Ex.PW-65/B. Endorsement
thereon in his handwriting Ex.PW-86/A is also not discredited.
502\. PW-65 Sh. Vishwanath, Dy. S.P. Samastipur, Special Division deposed that
on 02.1.1975, there was a function of inauguration of Broad Gauge Lines from
Samastipur to Muzaffarpur at Platform no. 3 of the Railway Station,
Samastipur. The then Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra was the Chief Guest to
inaugurate the Broad Gauge Lines. On that day i.e. 02.1.1975, he had gone to
Platform no. 3 Railway Station, Samastipur on duty. The original schedule time
of this function was 01.00 PM. Minister was to come from Darbhanga by a
Special Meter Gauge Train. This function was delayed and the Railway Minister
came there at about 5.20 PM. Sh. L.N. Mishra delivered a speech from a special
constructed Dais on Platform No. 3. He concluded his speech at 05.45 PM. PW-65
along with SDM was at a distance of about ten yards from the Pooja place where
BG Lines was to be inaugurated and it was towards South of that place of
Pooja. After concluding his speech, Sh. L.N. Mishra turned around to step down
from the Dais and suddenly there was a blast with a loud sound when the
Railway Minister was still on the Dais. The Railway Minister and several other
persons present on the Dais received injuries. He assisted in sending the
injured persons to the nearby Hospital. Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath
Mishra were taken to Special B.G. Train. He submitted a report in writing to
Officer Incharge GRP, Samastipur for registration of a case regarding the CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 594 blast. He suggested that case be registered u/s
120-B/307 IPC and Section 3 & 4 on Explosive Substance Act. He proved the
carbon copy of his Report Ex.PW-65/A for registration of the case prepared by
him with his own handwriting and bearing his signatures. He gave this Report
to the Officer Incharge GRP on the same day at about 8.00 PM. In his re-
examination PW-65 proved his original writing and signatures Ex.PW-65/B,
carbon copy of which is also Ex.PW-65/A. (Both these documents are available
in Folder R-7).
503\. The cross-examination of PW-65 reveals that there was a black flag
demonstration at Railway Station Samastipur on occasion of the visit of the
Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra on 02.1.1975. Slogans were raised against the
Minister during demonstration. He again said there was only black flag
demonstration and there were no slogans. He stated that demonstrators were the
members of Chhatra Sangarsh Samiti. The black flag demonstration was at
Platform no.7. There was shouting by slogans "Lalit Babu Zindabad" at the
arrival of the Minister for the function. He did not hear any slogans or
shouting against the Minister. 70% of the people were present in front of the
Minister at the time of function and about 200 persons were present at the
back. About 30-40 persons were present at the Dais. He admitted the suggestion
that a large number of local police officials, RPF and GRPF were on law and
order duty and for security purpose. Even the Magistrates were on duty. He
admitted the suggestion that the purpose of all the police officials was to
prevent the mischief and keep CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 595 a watch on the movement of
undesirable persons and others. No person of the public was allowed on the
track of the BG Lines, which was to be inaugurated. It was expected from the
officials on duty that they would not permit anyone coming on the Platform
no.3 where the function was to be held without "Invitation Card" or "Pass".
The Platform No.3 & 4 was on one side of the same Island and on the other side
of the same Island, was Platform No. 5 & 6\. This function, therefore, was on
the space of Platform no.3, 4, 5 & 6\. The area of the function was
demarcated. The Eastern and Western side of Island platform were being
protected and utilized for function. On two sides, there was a demarcation of
Railway lines. On one side, there was Munch and public was sitting in front of
Munch. (The location is reflected in Map Ex.PW-139/A). The spot indicated the
remnants of one hand grenade. His statement was recorded on 03.01.1975 and he
did not give the name of all the injured persons. The CBI officer recorded his
statement. They had no secret information that some Railway employees might
make an attempt on the life of the then Minister. He is aware that on 3.1.1975
pamphlets were distributed to the effect that Chhatra Sangarsh Samiti was
responsible for this blast. (On the reverse side of Ex.PW-65/B, there is
acknowledgement/ endorsement Ex.PW-86/A by Sh. R. Singh (PW-86 Sh. Rameshwar
Sain, Incharge) GRPS Samastipur to the effect that it was received at 20 hours
on 02.1.1975 and case No.1 dated 02.1.1975 registered u/s 3/4 Explosive
Substance Act and 120-B/307 IPC) (PW-86 has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 596 proved the
endorsement/acknowledgement Ex.PW-86/A and FIR Ex.PW-86/B).
504\. It comes out from his deposition on 02.1.1975, Sh. L.N. Mishra, Minister
was to visit the event by 01.00 PM, but reached late at 05.20 PM. There was a
crowd, some shouted slogans at a distant place. Sh. L.N. Mishra delivered the
speech from the Dais on Platform No.3 and concluded at 5.45 PM. As he
completed his speech, there was a blast with a loud sound, injuring several
persons there. Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra were taken to Special
BG Train. He submitted his Report to Officer Incharge for registration of the
case u/s 120- B/307 IPC and U/s 3 & 4 of Explosive Substance Act on the same
day at 8.00 PM. He proved his report Ex.PW-65/A and original writing
Ex.PW-65/B bearing his signatures. It can be easily said that there was heavy
security arrangements for the function and people were allowed only with
Passes/Badges and Invitation Cards. Police did not have secret information
that some Railway employees might make attempt on life of the then Railway
Minister.
505\. PW-146 Inspector Nageshwar Parsad Singh brought the original case diary
of GPR Case No. 1 of 1975 relating to murder of Sh. L.N. Mishra. He deposed
that he knew Deputy SP S.K.N. Singh as in the year 1975 both of them were
deputed and posted in GRP Samastipur. He had seen Sh. S.K.N. Singh writing and
signing and for that reason he could identify his handwriting and signature.
He had died in a road CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 597 accident in June 1983. In the
case diary brought by him relating to GRP Case No. 1 of 1975, there is a
statement dated 03.01.1975 of Deputy SP Vishwanath Singh of Samastipur, which
is in the handwriting of Sh. S.K.N. Singh. It also bears the signatures of Sh.
S.K.N. Singh. In his cross-examination, he admitted that Ex.PW- 65/DA is the
correct statement of Deputy SP Vishwanath Singh.
46) Testimony of Eyewitnesses other than PW-2 and PW-65.
506\. The prosecution has examined several eyewitnesses to the Samastipur
incident dated 02.01.1975. Those witnesses are PW-2 Vikram, PW-65 Vishwanath,
PW-3 Mahinder Parshad Sahu, PW-4 Rajender, PW-26 Narinder Parsad Issar, PW-28
Brij Nandan Prasad @ B.N. Prasad, PW-53 P.N. Tiwari, PW-56 Umesh Parshad
Singh, PW- 58 Ajay Kumar, PW-60 R.N. Rai and PW-129 Jayant Banerjee. Court
witnesses CW-2, Sh. Jiya Lal Arya, CW-3 Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra, CW-4 Sh. Ved
Prakash Gupta, CW-5 Sh. Baleshwar Ram CW-6 Sh. Pratap Singh and CW-7 Sh. Jwala
Prasad Singh have also been examined. I have already dealt with the testimony
of PW-2 and PW-
65\. Now I propose to deal with the testimony of other eyewitnesses.
507\. PW-3 Sh. Mahinder Parshad Sahu, a nephew of Shri Mahadev Parshad Sahu a
Railway employee residing in the Railway Quarters at the relevant time,
testified that on 02.01.1975 at about 03.30 PM, he, Shyam and Rajender (PW-4)
went to Railway Station, Samastipur.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 598 Neither of them was having any "Pass" or "Invitation
Card". There was a regular Dais, in front of which there were rows of chairs,
which were occupied by the time they reached there and consequently they had
to sit on the chairs at rear. At about 04.45 or 05.00 PM, Sh. L.N. Mishra
reached there in a Special Train from Lahariya Sarai side on Platform No. 3
itself. At that time, several people on Platform No. 1 were shouting as they
were not able to see or hear anything because of the obstructions caused by
the train. Sh. L.N. Mishra came on the Dais, where 30 or 35 persons were
present. Sh. Mishra then delivered the speech but they could not see him as
the persons in front of them had stood up. After crossing the Meter Gauge
Line, they also like others proceeded towards the Dais to have a better
glimpse of Sh. Mishra. There were some persons on the North of the Dais also.
After Sh. Mishra finished his speech, he acknowledged the greetings of the
crowd with folded hands and turned around and immediately at that time, a loud
explosion was heard at the Dais. Peoples started running away here and there.
They were at a distance of about 45 feet from the Dais. After few seconds,
they also started running on the Railway Track towards the West and after
running about two or four paces only, his cousin Rajender (PW-4) told him that
he had lost one of his chappals (slippers). He (PW-3) however run away without
waiting for Rajender and reached his residence. After sometime, Rajender also
reached there. His uncle Sh. Mahadev Sahu reached the residence at about
06.45-07.00 PM. Rajender informed him that he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 599 had found
one round object like motor of a fan at the Railway Station, which he promised
to show him next Morning. Rajender also told him that he had kept that object
in the flower-bed near the entrance of gate of that house. Out of his
inquisitiveness, he asked Rajender to show him that object at that very time
and on his pressing, Rajender took him towards that place. Since it was dark,
they located that object in the building. In the light of that room, they
found that the said object was metallic and of the size of a big egg. It could
not be held in a clinched-hand. There were grooves on that object and one big
screw on one end of that object and on the other end something like a pin
inserted in it. First he unscrewed that screw and then re-screwed and
thereafter he pulled up that pin. He felt that its lever was expanding and
there was hissing sound. Immediately, his cousin Asha shouted that it was a
bomb and he threw it in the adjoining store room and there was a loud
explosion like a bomb, which he had heard at the Railway Station. He sustained
multiple injuries and fell down. Later on, he came to know that Rajender
(PW-4) had also received injuries at that time. He (PW-3) was removed to the
hospital, where he remained confined for about 65 days.
508\. In his cross-examination, it is elicited that on 02.01.1975, when he
went to Parcel Office in the morning, he came to know that entry to the place
of meeting of Sh. L.N. Mishra was through "Invitations" or "Passes". He
noticed about 50 constables around the Dais at a distance of about 7 or 8
feet. He also noticed some police constables in the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 600
remaining portion of Platform No. 3. Nobody enquired from them about any
"Pass" to make entry in the venue. He explained that they were just children
at that time and there had been relaxation in "Pass" checking. He has denied
the suggestion that there was strict checking of passes at the Railway
Station. He did not see anyone throwing any object towards the Dais and he
only heard the sound of explosion. He denied the suggestion that police was
not permitting any person to reach within a distance of 30 feet from that
Dais. He reached the Platform No. 3 prior to arrival of Sh. Mishra. He also
denied the suggestion that no person without the passes was permitted to sit
on the chairs even in the rear portion. He deposed that some of the chairs in
the rear were unoccupied, they sat on them. He admitted that there were police
officers around rows of the chairs. He replied that in those days, Rajender
was a student of 8th Class. At the time of incident, his aunt was in the
Kitchen at a distance of about 6 or 7 paces from him. The store was situated
at about 6 or 7 paces from the place, where he was standing. Rajender was also
standing about 1 or 2 paces away from him. On his return from the hospital, he
noticed a pit of about 5-6 inches in depth near the door of that store. The
police approached him 3 or 4 days of the occurrence, while he was still in the
hospital. He gave his statement to the police. He admitted that he and his
uncle Mahadev Parshad were granted bail from the court of Sessions at
Samastipur. He deposed that police got him discharged from the case after
about a year.

509\. PW-4 Sh. Rajender Prasad Nayak, who is the son of Mahadev Sahu, a
Railway employee posted at Samastipur and residing in Railway Quarters deposed
that on 02.01.1975, he along with Shyam Babu went there at about 11.00 AM.
People were saying that Lalit Babu would reach at about 03.00 or 04.00 PM and
so they returned to their house. At about 03.00 PM, he and Mahender Sahu
(PW-3) and Shyam Babu went to the venue and no person checked passes and they
reached there. They seated there on the chairs lying on the rear. After about
1 or 1 1/4 hours of their having seated there, a train came from Lahariya
Sarai side on Meter Gauge Line and Lalit Babu alighted from one of the
compartment and reached the Rostrum. At that time, the persons, who had
collected on Platform No. 1 started shouting that they were not able to hear
or see anything due to train in between and subsequently that train was moved
ahead and those people from Platform No. 1 started moving towards the Dais and
they also moved there. They were stopped at a distance of about 30 or 35 paces
from the stage. After concluding his speech within 20 or 25 minutes, Lalit
Babu turned around and immediately there was an explosion on the Dais. People
started running helter-skelter and they also started running towards the
backside and hardly had run 2 or 4 paces, when he found one of his chappals
(slippers) got out of his foot. He informed Mahender Sahu (PW-3) about it. He
returned to retrieve his chappal, but he could not recover it. Mahender Sahu
(PW-3) and Shyam Babu did not wait for him. While he was returning on the CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 602 Meter Gauge Track, one object struck his bare foot.
He thought the object to be an electric motor of a fan and so he brought it to
his house. He kept it in the flower-bed in the compound of his house. At that
time, Shyam Babu and Mahender Sahu (PW-3) were already there. His mother,
younger brother Munni and Sister Asha @ Sharda were also there in the house.
He informed Mahender Sahu (PW-3) about the metallic object appear to be a
motor of fan, which he found on the Railway Track. Mahender Sahu (PW-3)
expressed his desire to see the object. He lifted and brought inside the
building. Mahender Sahu (PW-3) followed him. They were examining the object in
the hall. Mahender Sahu (PW-3) unscrewed a lid type from the object and he put
it back. The object was oval shape. On the outer surface of that object, there
were grooves. Mahender Sahu (PW-3) pulled one pin-sort of thing from that
object and at that time, his sister Asha came closer to them and told that
object looked like a bomb. Mahender (PW-3) threw the object in the store room,
which was at a distance of about 3/4 paces from the place they were standing
and there was explosion in the store. As a result, he and Mahender Sahu (PW-3)
suffered injuries. They were removed to hospital.
510\. It is elicited in the cross-examination of PW-4 that there was
sufficient light under which anything lying on the track could be seen. He
replied that his father was arrested in connection with the explosion at their
house. He did not conceal the object in the flower- bed and he has just kept
it there. He had not seen any hand grenade CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 603 prior to
02.01.1975. On 03.01.1975, he came to know that said object, which he had
found on the Railway Track was a hand grenade. After the explosion, he noticed
smoke on the Dais, which had engulfed the entire Dais after which hazy view
was visible. CBI officers had taken him to the said platform and recorded his
statement.
511\. It comes out from the statements of PW-3 & PW-4 that the defence did not
demolish their deposition of their attending the function, the explosion that
took place after conclusion of the speech by the Railway Minister. It is
argued by the Ld. Defence Counsel that there was no "Pass" system to enter
Platform No. 3 and PW-3 and PW-4 have made their entry to the venue without
possessing any Pass. Firstly this has been duly answered by the PW-3 in his
cross- examination that they were just children and for that reason nobody
asked them for the Pass. Secondly, the defence has admitted the system of
entry by Passes by giving suggestions to PW-3 that no person without the Pass
was permitted to sit on the chairs and that there was strict checking of
"Passes" to enter the venue. The theory of defence suffers from duality, on
this aspect is approbative and reprobative and without any definite stand of
their own. It is also noticeable that PW-3 was aged about 16 years and PW-4
was aged about 11 years at the time of incident. PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja,
Investigation Officer has deposed that on 10.01.1975, Bihar Police had
arrested seven persons including Mahadev Sahu, his two nephews and four of his
colleagues in respect of bomb blast at his house and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 604
arrested persons were interrogated and independent verification in due course
of time was got done, but nothing incriminatory could be established against
them. As such, he moved application for their release and subsequent to their
release on bail he filed application for their discharge for lack of any
evidence. Accordingly, all of them were discharged by the court of Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Samastipur. The defence has also not suggested to either
of them that they were involved in the crime in any manner. From the
deposition of PW-3 and PW-4, it is thus established that on 02.01.1975 that
there was an inaugural function of Railway Line at Samastipur Railway Station
at the hands of Sh. L.N. Mishra, Railway Minister, who arrived there at about
05.00 PM and after conclusion of his speech, when the Minister took a turned
around, there was a blast on the Dais. It is also established that there was
system of entry to venue by way of "Pass/Badge".
512\. PW-26 Sh. Narinder Parshad Issar deposed that during the year 1974-75,
he was worker of Congress (I) at Samastipur. On 02.01.1975, there was a
function of inauguration of Broad Gauge Line by the Railway Minister from
Samastipur to Muzaffarpur. On that day, at about 4.30 PM, he along with Umesh
Singh (PW-56), the then MLC, Sh. Shiv Shankar Singh, the then Editor, Dasha
Disha, Sh. Shiv Sagar Mishra, Sh. Jamuna Singh and others went to Railway
Station. Train came there at about 05.00 or 05.15 PM by which Sh. L.N. Mishra
arrived and reached the Dais. PW-26 followed Minister on the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 605 Dais, where 20 or 30 persons were present. Sh. Baleshwar Ram (CW-
5) welcomed the Minister. It was followed by the speech of the Railway
Minister, which lasted in 15 or 20 minutes. When the Minister was about to
conclude his speech, PW-26 stood at the corner of the Dais by the side of
stairs leading to the Dais. After concluding his speech, Minister was about to
take a turn, when some black object passed in between him and Sh. L.N. Mishra.
This black object came from North Side. That black object fell on the Dais,
which exploded and there was smoke. Many persons including Minister Sh. L.N.
Mishra sustained injuries. He assisted Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3) in taking
him to the Saloon. In his cross-examination, PW-26 answered that at that time
he was an Advocate and an active member of District Congress Committee. He
replied that the black object came while ascending and thereafter it
descended. It came at his chest level. The Railway Minister took a turn for
coming down stairs from the Dais. In his further cross-examination, the rough
Site Plan Ex.PW- 26/DB was put to him and he stated that he was standing at
Point 'A', Sh. L.N. Mishra was standing at Point 'B' and the black object fell
down at point 'C' where it exploded. The Site Plan showing sequence of seating
at the Dais as stated by PW-26 Ex.PW-26/DB is available in Folder R-7. This
was exhibited on request of Defence Counsel.
513\. It is manifest from a scrutiny of deposition of PW-26 that the defence
has not discredited his testimony particularly that a black object was passed
in between him and Sh. L.N. Mishra and it came CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 606 from North
side, which exploded after it fell down on the Rostrum. The defence elicited
in cross-examination, the position of the witness on the Dais and that of the
Minister, the place where the black object (hand grenade) fell down and got
exhibited the Site Plan Ex.PW- 26/DB, which fortifies the version of the
prosecution. The defence has also not discredited the testimony of PW-26 that
Sh. L.N. Mishra and Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra suffered injuries in the blast,
which took place on the Dais after conclusion of the speech by Sh. Mishra. The
de fence has never suggested that the explosive was stealthily installed
beneath the Dais by some others as argued by the Ld. Defence Counsel.
514\. PW-28 Sh. Brij Nandan Parshad, an injured, the then DIG, Darbhanga
Range, testified that on 23.12.1974, he received information about proposed
visit of Railway Minister to Darbhanga by Air and then to Samastipur by Train.
From Samastipur, his programme was to go to Muzaffarpur. On 24.12.1974, there
was a meeting with the Commissioner of Darbhanga Division Mr. Kundra in his
chamber regarding arrangements. DMs and SPs of Samastipur and Darbhanga
attended the meeting. On 30.12.1974, he went to Samastipur in connection with
the arrangement about visit of Minister and met local DM and SP. O n
02.1.1975, he went to Samastipur and before reaching Samastipur, he had gone
to Darbhanga Airport, where the Minister was received. Minister proceeded to
Sanskrit University. The Minister was to reach Airport at 10.00 AM. However,
he got late and came there at about 03.00 PM. After finishing the function in
Sanskrit CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 607 University, Minister came to Lahariya Sarai
Railway Station, and witness accompanied him. From there, he travelled by
Special Train. Besides Railway Minister, Commissioner Darbhanga Division, Dr.
Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3), Radha Nandan Jha, Ram Bilas Jha, Suraj Narain Jha
and Railway officials travelled in that Saloon and PW-28 was also in that
Saloon with the Minister.
515\. It has also come in his deposition that Special Train reached Platform
No. 3, Samastipur at about 05.15 PM. Then the Minister proceeded towards the
Dais. About 30 persons were already present on the Dais. CW-5 Sh. Baleshwar
Ram welcomed the Minister followed by the speech of the Minister. About 40-50
persons were present on the Dais. When Minister was delivering his speech,
information was received about black flag demonstration, which was perhaps
held towards Platform no. 7 and he asked Superintendent of Police, Samastipur
to tackle the situation. After some time SP, Samastipur came back and informed
him that some arrests have been made and people dispersed. He thought of
approaching the Minister with a request to conclude the speech. He approached
the Railway Minister and by that time, speech was concluded, Minister took a
turn & there was a blast on the Dais. PW-28 fell down and became unconscious.
On regaining consciousness, he found himself in Samastipur Hospital. He
deposed that in those days there was strike in the Medical College, Darbhanga
and he was taken to Nawab clinic, Darbhanga and remained admitted there as
Indoor Patient for about CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 608 three months. He was operated
upon thrice and was flown to America for further treatment. All his intestines
came out, there were about 50 splinters in his body, and 25 were still in his
body on the date of deposition. He joined duties 8 months later.
516\. In his cross-examination, PW-28 replied that meeting on 24.12.1974 was
to finalize the security arrangements. His purpose to visit Samastipur on
30.12.1974 was to assess the situation and security arrangements at the
Railway Station. He admitted that CRPF and RPF Jawans were also deployed with
local police. He reached Samastipur on 02.1.1975 and later on came to know
from SP that they were checking the passes of all the entrants/visitors. He
admitted the suggestion of the defence that before 02.1.1975, they had
received information that Karpuri Thakur's group might disrupt the function,
apart from disgruntled Railway employees. He admitted the suggestion that
Rajeshwar Mishra, Advocate wanted to go on the Dais and this witness stopped
him for having no "Pass" or "Invitation".
517\. From analysis of the deposition of PW-28, it is apparent that the
Minister reached Samastipur Railway Station at about 05.15 PM. About 30
persons were present on the Dais. During Speech by the Railway Minister, there
was black flag demonstration towards Platform No. 7 and PW-28 asked SP,
Samastipur to tackle the situation. PW-28 was going upstairs to request the
Minister to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 609 conclude his speech due to black flag
demonstration. By the time he approached the Minister, the speech was
concluded, there was a blast on the Dais and he suffered grievous injuries and
was taken to Samastipur Hospital. Tight security arrangements were made, as
suggested by the defence also. There was checking of the Passes to allow the
visitors to the venue. He admitted the suggestion of defence that before
02.1.1975, they had information that group of Karpuri Thakur and disgruntled
Railway employees might disrupt the function. He also admitted the suggestion
that Sh. Rajeshwar Mishra, Advocate, was denied entry, as he was not having
any pass. In the cross- examination of the PW-28, nothing could be elicited
which demolishes his affirmation of him being proximately located at the spot,
the security arrangements and the strict vigil with regard to the entrants to
the venue, the blast that took place and the injuries occurred to the witness
as well as others.
518\. PW-53 Sh. P.N. Tiwari, a PR Official of the Northern Division Railways
deposed that he was duty bound to disseminate information regarding Railways,
its activities to the Press and Media. An event was proposed for inauguration
of Broad Gauge Line between Samastipur and Muzaffarpur on 02.1.1975 by the
Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra at Samastipur. The scheduled time was 1300
hours (1.00 PM). He was instructed by his senior Sh. P.R. Chopra, GM, North-
Eastern Railway to make arrangements for publicity of the inaugural function.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 610 He deposed that 11,000 Invitation Cards were printed
from the Railway Press, Gorakhpur for the event. The sample invitation card at
Ex.PW-53/A is exhibited.
                        (This Invitation Card      Ex.PW-53/A    is
                        available in folder R-2)
519\. PW-53 further deposed that the proposed event being historical was given
wide publicity through All India Radio Station, Patna and Television Kendra.
Cards were sent throughout the country. Advertisements were released apart
from posters. He was at Samastipur on 01.1.1975 in connection with the said
event.
520\. In his further statement, PW-53 testified that he was at Samastipur on
02.1.1975 also. It is also testified by him that PW-28 Sh. Brij Nandan
Parshad, DIG, approaching the Minister on the Dais. This witness followed DIG
to the Rostrum in order to hand over the printed material to the Railway
Minister and to the General Manager. He could not reach the top of the Rostrum
and in fact, he had gone up to the last stair, when a loud explosion took
place at the Rostrum and the Minister had already concluded the speech and
took a turn before the explosion. PW-53 was pushed down, and noticed splinters
and smoke, and heard the people shouting "bomb-bomb", rushing out, jumping and
some helpless. Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra received injuries and was taken to his
MR Carriage on the Broad Gauge Line by the Senior Chief Security Officer
followed by Shiv Sagar Mishra. He did not go to that Carriage. After the
Railway Minister was taken CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 611 to the carriage, Ram Bilas
Jha met him outside that Carriage and directed that PW 53 to inform Chief
Operative Superintendent and Divisional Manager to start the train immediately
or at least within half an hour. He came to know through Ram Bilas Jha that
the Minister expressed his desire to be taken to Patna. Ram Bilas Jha told
witness to convey the same to Chief Operative Superintendent and Divisional
Superintendent. Sh. Ved Prakash Gupta (CW-4) was the P.A. to Railway Minister
then, who directed him to inform the media that after the event the Special
Train of the Minister was being diverted towards Patna. He conveyed them the
instructions that were given to him by Sh. Ram Bilas Jha and Sh. V.P. Gupta.
This Special Train left Samastipur for Patna at about 8.00 PM. Witness then
went to Railway Hospital, Samastipur and then to Civil Hospital, Samastipur to
see the DIG and also to ascertain the requirements of the blood etc. He left
Samastipur on 03.1.1975 in the evening with General Manager and reached
Gorakhpur in the afternoon of 04.1.1975.
521\. In his cross-examination PW-53 Sh. P.N. Tiwari was questioned about the
crowd in and around the venue and the location of arrangements for the
invitees. He also noticed large number of police on the date at venue. Witness
heard explosion but could not see from which side the bomb came on the
Rostrum.
To a suggestion, he replied having seen the people moving helter-skelter after
explosion immediately after the speech of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 612 Minister,
who spoke extempore. The Minister was sitting on the Rostrum, which was well
laid. The height of the Rostrum was elicited to be about 3 or 4 feet
approximately and about 30 to 40 people were sitting on the Rostrum. The
publicity was aimed at attracting grand crowd.
522\. Evaluating the testimony of PW-53, it can be concluded that on
02.01.1975 an event was organized to inaugurate the Broad Gauge Line at
Samastipur Railway Station in which the Minister participated. Wide publicity
was carried out by the Railway, which got printed "Invitation Cards",
distributed the same throughout the country. This witness had heard that there
was an explosion after the conclusion of the speech by L.N. Mishra, the
Minister and that there was a 30 to 40 persons on the Dais and also a big
crowd gathered, which went helter- skelter after the explosion. This witness
had seen PW-28 approaching the Minister prior to the blast. It also emerges
that the Minister, who was injured in the blast, wishes to be taken to Patna
for his treatment as told to him by Ram Bilas Jha and the line was cleared for
the Special Train, to depart to Patna, which left Samastipur by 08.00 PM.
523\. PW-56 Sh. Umesh Parshad Singh, MLC, Bihar, deposed that he participated
in the event on 02.01.1975 at Samastipur, seated behind the Railway Minister
on the Rostrum. The Minister spoke for about 20 minutes. After conclusion, the
Minister took a turn to get down, PW- 56 observed something coming from his
left hand side and moving CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 613 towards right in front of him.
Before he could realize as to what it was, there was a blast and that article
was of dark black colour, the size of which was less than a ball and its
diameter could be of about three inches. He again said it was of deep grey
colour. People started running and PW-56 suffered injuries and was taken to
Samastipur Hospital in a jeep. He was given first aid and went to Patna and
got himself treated at Popular Nursing Home for about 10 days.
524\. It is elicited in his cross-examination that PW-56 reached the venue by
11.30 AM or 12 Noon and waited till arrival of the Minister. The Rostrum was
about 18/19 X 15/16 feet and there was 7/8 feet vacant space in front of the
Rostrum. The open space was about 18/19 X 7/8 feet in front of the Rostrum.
About 40 - 45 people were sitting on the Rostrum. As the Minister spoke, there
was hooting from a distant place. He did not see black flag demonstration. He
knew only 10-15 persons, who sat on the Rostrum. He was in Congress party at
that time. The Bihar police met him 3-4 days after the incident at Popular
Nursing Home and recorded his statement. He answered that some article came
from his left hand side and moved towards his right hand side. (He was
confronted with his statement Ex.PW-56/DA - witness stated therein that
"passed by his side"). He informed the police that the article was of dark
black and deep grey colour. (Confrontation of the statement Ex.PW-56/DA
reveals that it was "black"). He has denied the suggestion that the black
substance was thrown from the Rostrum itself and stuck to his earlier
statement.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 614
525\. A close look of the deposition of PW-56 reveals that he was sitting on
the Dais behind the Minister on that date. The testimony of the witness that
some substance passing from his left to right side, which exploded soon after
the Minister concluded his speech and the injuries sustained by him are not
demolished in the cross-examination. His first aid treatment at Samastipur and
further treatment at Popular Nursing Home is also fortified.
526\. PW-57 Sh. Brij Mohan Sharma, an ex-serviceman-teacher and social worker,
deposed that he along with 8 or 10 persons of his area reached Samastipur on
01.1.1975 to attend the function of 02.01.1975 in order to present a "Charter
of Demand" to the Minister to include their village on the BG Line. He reached
the venue only after securing a Pass/Badge given by a Congress Sewa Dal
worker. (The witness identified the Badge Ex.P-8 and stated that Badge looked
alike the one secured by him)
527\. He deposed that he sat on the Dais with the help of Sh. Ram Bhagat
Paswan, MP of their area. Minister was giving speech when he went to Munch.
After the Minister concluded his speech, the witness garlanded the Minister
who moved one or two steps towards the stairs and then there was an explosion
on the Munch in which witness also received serious injuries due to splinters.
He was taken to the Railway Hospital, Samastipur where he remained admitted
for 12 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 615 days. He remained confined to his home for about
one year and could not do any heavy work. He suffered fracture in his foot and
one such splinter was still in his foot. He brought Sewa Samiti Dal Badge in
the court and on the request of the Ld. Defence counsel, the Badge was
produced in the court which was exhibited as Ex.PW-57/DA (available in Folder
R-7).
528\. In his cross-examination, the defence elicited that similar Badges were
given to all of them numbering 8 or 9 and all his companions accompanied him
to the venue. He answered that the Congress worker was known to him. He stated
that he wrote a number of letters to include their village on the BG Line and
received even reply. He replied that Ex.PW-57/DA might be called a "Badge" or
a "Pass". The police was not permitting anyone without a "Pass".
529\. Perusal of the testimony of PW-57 reflects that he had been a teacher,
an ex-serviceman and was a social worker attached to congress party. He along
with 8 or 10 companions came to Samastipur to present a "Charter of Demand" to
the Minister. The defence could not shatter his testimony that the entry to
the venue was by Passes/Badges and he and his all companions entered the venue
with Congress Sewa Dal Passes. Defence themselves got exhibited a Pass through
this witness. The defence also could not deride his presence on the Dais,
garlanding of Minister, the explosion and suffering of injuries. The Congress
Sewa Samiti Dal Badge, which he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 616 brought in the court, was
got produced in the court and exhibited as Ex.PW-57/DA. The size of the Badge
is 3.5 inches X 2.75 inches. This badge/pass/card is similar to
Badge/Pass/Card Ex.P-8 (available in Folder R-4). On the front side of the
Badge/Pass/Card, "Congress Sewa Dal Samastipur" is printed in Hindi.).
Ex.PW-57/DA (available in Folder R-7) reads as under:-

530\. PW-58 Sh. Ajay Kumar, then aged 10 years, who is the son of the then
Incharge, GRP Railway Station Samastipur at the relevant time, testified that
on 02.1.1975, he went to the venue. The Railway Minister came there at 05.00
PM and the witness was sitting behind Press Gallery, which was in front of the
Munch. PW-58 took one garland from a person found near the Dais having

conclusion of the speech, the Railway Minister took a turn and moved 1 or 2
steps ahead. The witness also moved 1 or 2 steps forward in order to garland
the Minister and in the meantime he heard explosion and received injuries on
his chest. He (PW-58) jumped from the Dais and became unconscious and on
regaining consciousness, he found himself in Janta clinic, Darbhanga where he
remained under the treatment of Dr. S.M. Nawab.

531\. It is elicited in his cross-examination that in those days he was a
student of seventh class. On date of deposition i.e. on 10.11.1982, he was 16
years of age. He was aware about the necessity of Pass to reach the venue. He
did not have any "Invitation Card" or "Pass" with him but he gained entry
being the son of the Incharge of GRP. He did not know the person, who was
standing near the Dais with garlands, earlier and he gave him one garland on
request. He was at a distance of about 7/8 paces from the Railway Minister at
the time of the explosion. After about 15 days, one person came to him in the
clinic and made enquiries about the incident.
532\. After scrutinizing the evidence of PW-58, who was aged about 10 years at
the time of incident and a son of Incharge, GRPS, Samastipur Railway Station,
demonstrates that the Railway Minister arrived there at 05.00 PM. He was aware
about the necessity of the Passes. He took a garland and went to Rostrum to
garland the Railway Minister. After conclusion of Minister's speech, as the
Railway Minister took a turn and moved 1/2 steps ahead, PW-58 also moved
forward to garland the Railway Minister, he heard explosion and suffered
injuries on his chest. He jumped from Dais and became unconscious. On
regaining consciousness, he found himself in Janta Clinic, Darbhanga under
treatment of Dr. S.M. Nawab.
533\. PW-60 R.N. Rai, Officer Incharge, Railway Station, Siwaan GRP received
orders from his superior to be on ring round duty with CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 618

J.C. Kundra also sat with the Railway Minister in his Saloon. The PA, personal
staff and servants of the Railway Minister also sat in that Saloon. He (PW-60)
also travelled in that Saloon and Special Train left Lahariya Sarai Railway
Station for Samastipur at about 5/5.15 PM. At Samastipur, he escorted the
Minister to the venue for the function. S/S Jagan Nath Mishra, Ram Bilas Jha,
B.N. Parshad, Commissioner J.C. Kundra also came on the Dais with the
Minister. The DIG B.N. Parshad did not remain on the Dais and came down. After
escorting the Minister to the Dais, this witness came down and remained on the
back of the Munch. During the speech of Minister, his Special Train by which
Sh. L.N. Mishra and others came to Samastipur was removed from the Platform.
After removal of Special Train, persons standing on that side moved ahead and
came near the Munch. The Railway Minister concluded his speech at about 5.45
PM and at that time he (PW-60) was on the backside of the Munch. After the
speech was over, slogans "Lalit Babu Jindabad" were raised and there was a CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 619 blast on the Dais and there was smoke. The DIG B.N.
Parshad was on the Munch at the time of the blast and he (PW-60) immediately
went to the Munch and there were many injuries on the person of Sh. B.N.
Parshad, DIG who was crying. Sh. L.N. Mishra also received injuries and he
with the help of Hawaldar rendered assistance in removing DIG B.N. Parshad
from the Munch. After bringing DIG down from the Munch, he again rushed to the
Munch and in the meantime, Sh. Rattan Singh, Security man of Railway Minister
and 2-3 others came and rendered assistance to Sh. L.N. Mishra. They took him
to the Saloon of Broad Gauge Line of the Special Train, which was to be
inaugurated. The DIG was escorted to a vehicle outside the Railway Station and
that Special Train left Railway Station, Samastipur at about 8 PM and he
travelled in that Saloon with Railway Minister. He came to know about death of
Sh. L.N. Mishra on 3.1.1975 at Barauni.
534\. After perusal of the cross-examination, I find that the defence had
questioned him on the very facts he stated in his chief. The cross-
examination does not go to erase his presence as an escort at the venue and
having witnessed the blast, in which the Minister was injured and subsequent
shifting of the Minister in a Saloon of the Special Train.
535\. His testimony also reaffirms that DIG Prasad was injured in the incident
and that this witness had helped him to move away from the Dais to the
Hospital and the Minister was helped by a Security Personnel to be shifted to
the Saloon.

536\. CW-5 Sh. Jiya Lal Arya, the then District Magistrate, Samastipur
appeared as a Court witness and his deposition reflects that that he was
behind the Dais and the blast took place after conclusion of the speech by Sh.
L.N. Mishra.
537\. PW-85 Sh. Ram Bhagat Paswan deposed that he was Member of Parliament in
1975 also and knew Sh. L. N. Mishra. On 02.1.1975, he was to accompany Sh. L.
N. Mishra, the Railway Minister, to Samastipur from Darbhanga. He could not
accompany him and so, he along with some other persons travelled by jeep to
Samastipur from Darbhanga and reached Samastipur at 4.30 PM. Sh. L. N. Mishra
reached Samastipur by Special Train at about 5/5.30 PM. DIG, Darbhanga,
Commissioner, Darbhanga and others escorted the Minister to the Dais. PW-85
also went to the Munch and sat on the first row. There Ram Sukumari Devi,
Kapil Deo Singh, Ram Vinod Sharma were also sitting in the front row on the
Munch. There were 50 to 60 persons sitting on the Munch but he is not definite
about exact number of persons seated on the Dais. There was an explosion on
the Munch after the Railway Minister concluded his speech. Witness also
received injuries on both of his legs because of the explosion and became
unconscious. On regaining consciousness, he found himself at Dr. Nawab's
clinic, Darbhanga and remained in the clinic for about three weeks and he
suffered fracture in his right leg. He could not work for about six months due
to fracture and injuries. After his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 621 discharge from
Dr. Nawab's Clinic, Darbhanga, he remained at Willingdon Hospital, New Delhi,
for about a month. Seven splinters were present in his legs as on the date of
his deposition.
(Ex.PW-93/H is the Bed Head Ticket of Ram Bhagat Paswan and his other medical
papers are Ex.PW-104/B).
538\. In his cross-examination PW-85 Sh. Ram Bhagat Paswan admitted the
suggestion that he is an old Congress (I) member and commands respect in his
area. He received invitation for the function held at Samastipur Railway
Station. He had taken that Invitation Card with him for going to the Railway
Station, Samastipur. Some persons with him were not allowed to go on the
Munch. Two persons accompanied him up to some distance from the Munch but the
police officers asked for the "Pass" on their reaching near the Munch. To his
knowledge, "Invitation Cards" and "Passes" were not being distributed near the
Munch. His "Invitation Card" was seen before he went up on the Munch. The
height of the Munch was 4 ft and there were stairs for going to the Munch. The
Railway Minister had taken a turn after finishing his speech when there was an
explosion. Samastipur was in his area and he was representing that area as
Member of Parliament. He stated that he knew Congress Sewa Dal and was
associated with it during his student days but no Congress Sewa Dal volunteer
met him there. He came to Willingdon Hospital in New Delhi in the first week
of February 1975 and CBI officers met him there for taking his statement. Sh.
Ram Bilas Jha was an MLC in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 622 those days who was also in
Congress (I). He denied the suggestion that Sh. Ram Bilas Jha was jealous of
Sh. L.N. Mishra. It was not necessary that Sh. Ram Bilas Jha always used to
accompany Sh. L.N. Mishra. Sometimes Sh. Ram Bilas Jha used to accompany Sh.
L.N. Mishra. He did not hear anyone calling Sh. Ram Bilas Jha as "Boss Jha".
The explosion took place in his presence. It was not possible someone sitting
on the Munch threw that bomb. He did not see any black flag demonstration
against Sh. L.N. Mishra when he was sitting on the Munch.
539\. While dissecting the deposition of PW-85, who was also injured in the
incident, it comes to the fore that on 02.1.1975, he sat on the Munch in the
1st row at the Platform. There DIG and Commissioner Darbhanga and others
escorted Sh. L.N. Mishra, Railway Minister. There were about 50 persons on the
Munch when there was an explosion after the Minister concluded his speech.
This witness received injuries on his both legs due to explosion and became
unconscious. On regaining consciousness, he found himself in Dr. Nawab's
Clinic, Darbhanga and remained admitted there for 3 weeks. He suffered
fracture in right leg and could not work for about 6 months. After his
discharge from Dr. Nawab's Clinic, he remained admitted in Willingdon
Hospital, New Delhi in February 1975. He admitted the suggestion of the
defence that he commands respect in the area and thus even the defence admits
that his deposition is trustworthy. He took his Invitation Card with him to
the venue.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 623 However, his two companions were not allowed entry to
go on the Dais by the police for want of Passes. The argument of the Ld.
Counsel for the defence that there was no pass system to make entry in the
function at Platform No. 3 does not stand in view of the information elicited
in cross-examination by the defence. The deposition of the witness that there
was explosion soon after the Minister had taken a turn after finishing his
speech could not be shattered in his cross-examination. PW-85, who stood the
test of cross-examination, was questioned by the defence as regards the
possibility of flinging the bomb from the Munch (Dais/Rostrum) itself by which
it is negated.
540\. PW-109 Mohan Kumar Jha, a distant relative of Sh. L.N. Mishra, deposed
that on 02.1.1975, he accompanied Sh. L.N. Mishra up to the Dais. He speaks of
the presence of several persons in the entourage of the Minister by names S/S
Gauri Badla, V.P. Gupta, Additional Private Secretary of Railway Minister, Pt.
Vishwanath Jha, Parmanand Jha and others. All of them reached the Dais. This
witness handed over a thermos bottle to Rattan Singh, security man of the
Minister, which was passed on to the Minister on the Dais and left the venue
to go to Sa loon. Thereafter he was going towards the Saloon when he heard a
loud explosion. He also noticed that Sh. L.N. Mishra, being brought injured by
S/S Shiv Sagar Mishra, Kanhaiya, Mahender Narain Jha, MLA, Rattan Singh,
Security Guard and others towards the Saloon of the Special Train. That Train
left Samastipur for CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 624 Danapur at about 7.00 PM. From
Danapur, dead body of Sh. L.N. Mishra was brought to Balwa Bazaar, Distt.
Saharsa.
541\. In his cross-examination, PW-109 answered that Sh. L.N. Mishra was his
distant relative. He did not have any association with Congress (I) or
Railways and he had gone because of his personal relationship with Sh. L.N.
Mishra. Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra and General Manager (Railways) also travelled in
the Train from Lahariya Sarai to Samastipur. The Train left Railway Station,
Lahariya Sarai at about 03.00 PM. About 40-50 police officers were present
near the Dais. There were about 20-30 persons on the Dais. He knew that the
cards were distributed (for the function). He was at a distance of about 8 ft.
when he heard a loud explosion. He received the Invitation Card from the
Railways and not from Sh. L. N. Mishra. CMO was looking after Sh. L.N. Mishra
at Samastipur but could not say what treatment he had given to him. He was in
another portion of the same Saloon of Sh. L.N. Mishra when Train left
Samastipur for Danapur. They vacated the portion of the Saloon in which Sh.
L.N. Mishra was present after half an hour and then doctors were attending to
him. He could not remember whether there was any black flag demonstration
after arrival of the Train from Lahariya Sarai until the incident. 20/25
persons were present on one side and 20/25 persons were present on the other
side of the Dais besides the persons sitting on the chairs.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 625
542\. Appreciating the evidence of PW-109, one can say that he accompanied Sh.
L.N. Mishra to the Dais. Sh. V.P. Gupta (CW-4) and Sh. Vishwanath Jha (PW-65)
also travelled in that Saloon. The line of cross-examination fortifies his
presence at the spot, there being a crowd on the Dais, having heard the
explosion and further having seen L.N. Mishra in injured state and shifted to
the Saloon in the Special Train, which left for Danapur.
543\. PW-113 Sh. Raj Dev Rai deposed that he has been Mukhiya of Gram
Panchayat of Malikaur since 1968 and an active member of Congress since 1966.
He knew Lalit Babu Mishra since 1956. He received an Invitation Card from the
Railway Authorities, Samastipur and another from Railway Authorities,
Muzaffarpur regarding inaugural function of Broad Gauge Line to be held on
02.1.1975. On 02.1.1975 at about 11.00 AM he along with Baleshwar Ram, Rama
Kant Jha and Satender Singh besides others went to the Railway Station,
Samastipur at Platform no.3. The "Passes" available with them were checked at
the entrance of the Railway Station. He sat on the chair lying on the Platform
while Rama Kant Jha and Baleshwar Ram went to the Dais and there was an
announcement at 12.30 PM /01.00 PM that Railway Minister would be late. He
returned to the Railway Station, Samastipur at about 3.30 PM and sat in the
third row in front of the Dais. He went near the Dais at about 04.45 PM/5.00
PM with a garland in his hand to receive Lalit Narain Mishra after hearing the
announcement that Railway Minister is coming. Sh. L.N.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 626 Mishra came at about 5.15 PM, and they garlanded him
and then Sh. L.N. Mishra went on the Dais. S/S Baleshwar Ram and Rama Kant Jha
and others accompanied Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra on the Dais. He
(PW-113) stood near the stairs towards the North-East of the Dais. There were
30/35 persons on the Dais including Jagan Nath Mishra, Rama Kant Jha, Y.P.
Mandal, Baleshwar Ram, Surya Narain Jha, Ram Vinod Sharma, Ram Sukumari Devi,
Ram Naresh Singh, Suresh Prasad Singh, Kailash Pati Singh and Kapil Deo Narain
Singh. After finishing his speech, Sh. L.N. Mishra folded his hands towards
the audience and after taking a turn moved 2-3 steps, when he heard some sound
and thereafter smoke appeared, people started falling, and then he realised
that it was a bomb blast. People started running away. This function was
presided over by Sh. Baleshwar Ram who welcomed the Railway Minister. He moved
ahead and noticed that Sh. L.N. Mishra was about to fall but Ram Sukumari Devi
assisted him by holding him in her hand. The witness lifted Ram Vinod Sharma
in injured condition and handed him over to others to remove him to the
hospital. Thereafter with the help of others, he lifted Jamuna Mandal who was
removed to the Hospital. He noticed that Sh. L.N. Mishra was taken towards the
Special Train, which was to go to Muzaffarpur and Sh. L.N. Mishra was made to
sit in that train.
544\. In his cross-examination PW-113 answered that there was no black flag
demonstration on Platform No.3. There were no slogans of "L.N. Mishra
Murdabad" in that function. However, there was some CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 627
opposition from Platform No.1. Sh. L.N. Mishra was garlanded after he alighted
from the Train and came to the Dais. After Railway Minister finished his
speech, some persons wanted to give memo and garland Sh. L.N. Mishra but he
could not say whether they succeeded in doing so or not. When he rendered help
to Sh. Ram Vinod Sharma and Jamuna Mandal, his clothes got blood stained.
Police used to check "Passes" before allowing persons to go inside the place
of function. He has denied the suggestion that during Railway strike, the
Railway employees were violent and aggressive. There was no apprehension that
the Railway employees turning violent during the inaugural function. He had a
discussion with Sh. Rama Kant Jha and Sh. Baleshwar Ram in the Inspection
Bungalow on 1.1.1975 about bringing of Sh. L.N. Mishra from Darbhanga and also
that Congress Sewa Dal Badges were printed and some workers would be using
them. During the talks, Sh. Rama Kant Jha told him that the Railway
authorities have allowed Sewa Dal workers to be present with Sewa Dal Badges.
545\. I have given my close look to the deposition of PW-113, which is
reliable, cogent and trustworthy in so far as his presence, the connections he
had with the Minister and his active role in helping the injured to be shifted
for medical aid are all vivid and a firsthand eye witness account, which
cannot be discarded. This witness further fortifies the factum of the presence
of Congress workers, who were distributing the Passes and the police
restricting the entry only to such CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 628 Pass holders. He
has further given the firsthand account of names of several persons, who were
present on the Dais at the time of the incident. The cross-examination
remained unsuccessful
546\. PW-116 Dr. K.M. Sinha, the then Assistant Medical Officer, NE Railway,
Divisional Hospital, Samastipur, deposed that on 02.1.1975 at about 4.30/5.00
PM, he along with Dr. M.N. Sharma, Medical Superintendent and some Engineers,
Railway officers, went to Railway Station Samastipur at platform no.3. He
listened to the speech of Sh. L.N. Mishra, the then Railway Minister. After
finishing his speech, Sh. L.N. Mishra spoke "Jai Hind" and then he took a turn
towards his back. In the meantime there was a flash on the Dais followed by
smoke and some thunder sound and heard cries of some occupants of Dais. He saw
some persons jumped from the Dais. Dr. M.N. Sharma came by his side and they
both went on the Dais. He found that General Manager, Mr. Chopra, standing on
the Dais, was lifted for giving him medical aid. In the meantime, others also
came on the Dais. He was directed by Dr. M.N. Sharma to rush to the Hospital
and to arrange for first aid for the injured who, were to be sent to the
Hospital. He immediately rushed to the Hospital. He contacted the doctors on
telephone and rang up emergency bell for summoning of doctors and staff due to
emergency. There is no cross- examination by the accused persons on these
aspects and thus his testimony is not discredited.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 629
547\. PW-127 Sh. Jayant Banerjee deposed that in September 1974, he was
transferred to Samastipur as Signal Inspector. On 02.1.1975 at about 03.30 PM,
he was asked by his superior to be on the Dais of Platform no.3 for adjustment
of the mike and he accordingly went on the Dais at about 05.00/05.15 PM and
sat on the right hand corner. The Railway Minister has already arrived on the
Dais along with the party. After finishing his speech, the Railway Minister
took a turn and within 10/15 seconds, there was a blast. There were about
25/30 persons on the Dais at that time and some of them were sitting and some
were standing. He was standing on the Dais at that time. He noticed one person
in police uniform coming on the Dais, who fell down. He jumped down from the
Dais wherefrom his staff removed him to Hospital. He received injuries on his
left arm and right buttock. He noticed one or two persons falling on the Dais.
Bihar Police in the Hospital recorded his statement.
548\. In his cross-examination at the behest of accused Santoshanand and
Sudevanand, it is elicited that he was inquired by the police only in the
hospital on 04.01.1975 and that on 02.01.1975, he was operated upon. An
unwanted suggestion was made to this witness that L.N. Mishra was the symbolic
determination of the government to break the strike, for which this witness
expressed his inability and later agreed. The cross-examination does not go to
shatter the testimony of this witness concerning the blast occurred soon after
conclusion of the speech by the Railway Minister and many people getting
injured CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 630 including this witness. There is no cross-
examination on behalf of accused Gopalji, Arteshanand and Ranjan Dwivedi and
they did not choose to cross-examine this witness despite opportunity.
549\. CW-3 Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra deposed that Sh. L.N. Mishra was his eldest
brother who got injured in the incident on 02.1.1975 at Samastipur Railway
Platform and died on 03.1.1975 at Danapur Railway Hospital. He (CW-3) also
suffered injuries in the bomb blast. The bomb exploded soon after his brother
finished the speech. It is found in his statement before the court that an
unusual opinion delivered by him when he was asked to speak about the incident
and his statement made to the police. This opinion is that there was lack of
security in the Railway Platform and that his elder brother L.N. Mishra did
not get proper medical attention in time. However, he admits that there was a
bomb explosion occurred, while he was on the Dais and it was the Evening time.
He further wondered the incident as a mystery and stated that he is unable to
understand, who was behind it. He further stated that he has nothing to say in
respect of the involvement of the accused persons. He further expressed his
inability to speak anything with regard to his statement made to the police
found at Mark-A.
550\. This witness was allowed to be cross-examined by the Special PP and it
is elicited that he had received his brother at the Airport and accompanied
him to Darbhanga and from Darbhanga to Samastipur by CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 631 a
Special Train. He admits having sat along with his brother on the Dais and
that there were 20 to 30 persons. He expressed his inability to say from where
the bomb came from but he knows only about the injuries sustained by him. He
had shown his unawareness as to who founded the Anand Marg or whether Prabhat
Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand Murti founded Anand Marg or whether the said Anand Murti
@ P.R. Sarkar was working in Bihar Railways. Again he stated that he knew an
Organisation by the name of Anand Marg. He admitted to be an MLC from
Muzaffarpur Saran Champaran in Bihar. He further admits that one Abdul Gaffoor
was the Chief Minister of Bihar during 1974. He does not know about any cases
were registered against Anand Marg and Anand Margies. He did not feel that
Railway Union or any organisation intended to kill L.N. Mishra. A specific
suggestion was put by the Ld. Special PP to this witness suggesting that after
the conclusion of the investigation by CBI, the mystery is solved. To this
suggestion CW-3 admits that the mystery might have been solved but for him,
the mystery remained so. He did not remember anything with regard to the
dismissal of bail applications of Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar and to secure his
release, the Anand Margies resorted to armed struggle. This witness also did
not know the attack on his brother was organised by Anand Margies for securing
the release of P.R. Sarkar. He also did not know that his brother L.N. Mishra
was close to Sh. Gaffoor, the then Chief Minister of Bihar in the year 1974.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 632
551\. The cross-examination of this witness was also permitted on behalf of
the accused, who have extensively cross-examined him. It is elicited that he
is unaware about his statement given to the police on 20.01.1975 and having
stated therein that Samastipur was not the proper place for the function. He
also does not remember whether there was any Railway strike and that the
employees were aggressive and that his brother was aware about it. He had no
intelligence reports concerning his brother. It is elicited by the very
accused that after the conclusion of the speech of his brother, CW-3 got up
from his seat to accompany his brother to get down, then the explosion took
place. He did not see any bomb falling on the Dais or around the Dais. He
admits that he himself and his brother got injured and fell unconscious. CW-3
also does not remember whether he told the police about his brother informing
him that the locals might have been misled by others and that the conspiracy
might be of the big people. He also does not remember whether he told the
police suspecting the involvement of one of the persons, who lost the
elections. He also does not remember whether it was Dr. Bhalla, CMO
Samastipur, who treated him and his brother. He also does not remember of
telling to the police that Dr. Bhalla deliberately did not treat his brother
properly. He also does not remember who took the decision to take them by
Saloon to Danapur. He denied the suggestion that Bihar Government had its own
helicopter at that time. However, he admitted that there was no air field at
Samastipur to airlift anyone. He CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 633 also admits that there
was a strike by the Government doctors and that is why they were not taken to
Darbhanga or Patna for treatment. He is also unaware about the constitution of
a Board of medical experts at the orders of Bihar Government. He admits that
his brother was injured in his abdomen. To a court question, he stated that he
was unconscious after the incident and when he reached Danapur, he was semi-
conscious and regained consciousness on the night of 03.01.1975 and he was not
even informed about the death of his brother, which was informed to him only
in the night. He did not know whether postmortem on the body of his brother
was conducted or not.
552\. The manner in which this court witness responded to a grave and ghastly
incident is really perplex and can be termed as a reflex of fear psychosis.
This observation is warranted considering the standing of this witness in the
public life. This witness is the younger brother of disincarnated Union
Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra in the bomb blast, in which incident he also suffered
injuries, resulting in him losing the consciousness. He had responded to the
questions concerning the day to day affairs in State of Bihar as a threatened
witness in so far as giving evasive answers expressing his unawareness to the
important and vital on-goings in his State of Bihar. He deposed that despite
the reports of investigation by the CBI in tracing out the crime, its genesis
and the perpetrators, this witness strangely claims the entire incident as
still a mystery. He gives the answers to the questions regarding the Anand
Marg, its founder, registration of cases against Anand Marg CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 634 and rejection of bail application of Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, who
is the cult head of Anand Marg, in pell-mell so that the truth does not
surface. It is strange that a person of his stature, who was a Legislator, a
Minister in the State of Bihar and Later its Chief Minister and who held many
responsible positions in the State Government and Union Government is
unwilling and evasive to speak about the important developments in the society
and organizations that spread its tentacles of terror. If the responsible
persons of the stature of CW-3 were to give such irresponsible, evasive and
tumultuous answers in the court of law, what best can be expected of a common
man to speak truth. However, this witness had given the half truth except
admitting his injuries to him and to his brother, which ultimately led to the
death of his brother L.N. Mishra. The net effect of his evidence only proves
that there was an explosion immediately after the speech of Sh. L.N. Mishra at
the scene of occurrence, which resulted in injuries to several persons
including this witness and the death of three persons, which included Sh. L.N.
Mishra.
553\. Suffice it to say, his deposition is helpful to hold that there was no
airfield at Samastipur and that the Bihar Government was not having its own
helicopter. This observation is warranted to understand the situation in which
a Union Minister seriously injured in the incident was to be shifted by the
train for a Hospital at a distant place, which took its own time in the
peculiar situation, where the doctors in the State of Bihar were on cease work
(strike). The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 635 testimony of this witness, who was also
treated by Dr. Bhalla, CMO of Samastipur goes to show that he does not impute
any irresponsible treatment by the doctor to him and his brother. It is also
pertinent to mention that CW-4 Sh. V.P. Gupta, the P.A. of the Minister
deposed that it was Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3), who had taken the decision to
shift Sh. L.N. Mishra to Danapur.
554\. PW-110 Sh. S.S. Pachauri, the then Assistant Mechanical Engineer,
Samastipur Division deposed that on 01.1.1975 Sh. J.S. Azad, the then
Divisional Mechanical Engineer, gave him instructions for escorting Railway
Minister, L. N. Mishra from Darbhanga to Samastipur on 02.1.1975. His duty was
to remain on engine and to see that the train operation was according to the
schedule and instructions. On 1.1.1975 at about 10/10.15 PM, he left
Samastipur for Darbhanga. On 2.1.1975, he examined the engine of the Special
Train, which was to carry the Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra from Darbhanga
to Samastipur. They left Darbhanga at 11 AM and Special Train reached the
Railway Station, Lahariya Sarai. The Railway Minister came there at about 3.30
PM. The Railway Minister travelled in the Saloon, which was reserved for him.
The Special Train started from Railway Station, Lahariya Sarai at 4.10 PM and
reached Samastipur at 5.10 PM and during this period he was on the engine foot
plate. The Special Train reached Platform no.3 of Railway Station, Samastipur
and there Railway Minister alighted from the train, which remained stationed
there for about 10 minutes. Thereafter, the train was moved on giving CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 636 of a signal by the Station Master himself. A short whistle was
blown by the engine before it started. After the train was moved ahead to
clear the view for other platform, the engine was detached from the train. The
engine left for the shed and he left for the control room. The engine had
hardly left and he had hardly moved and crossed the BG Line from Platform
No.3, he heard loud explosion. He stopped and came back and heard about the
injuries to many VIPs. The Special BG Train left Samastipur between 7.30 PM
and 8.00 PM. His testimony on these facts could not be discredited by the
defence.
555\. PW-102 Sh. Adeshwari Parshad Sinha was the Assistant Station Master MG
Line Samastipur in the year 1975. He deposed that he was working as Assistant
Station Master (Indoor) on Meter Gauge Line, Samastipur. Assistant Station
Master (Cabin) used to give clearance of the line to the train arriving at the
Railway Station, Samastipur and trains leaving that Railway Station. He also
used to record the timings of such arrival and departure of the train. It used
to be communicated to him, while he was working as ASM (Indoor) and he used to
make entries in this regard in the Detention Register. After seeing the entry
in the Detention Register Ex.P-187, he testified that the entries dated
02.1.1975 Ex.PW-102/A & Ex.PW-102/B were correctly recorded. On 2.1.1975, his
duty hours were from 1600 hours to 2400 hours, down Passengers Special Train
reached Samastipur Railway Station at 5.12 PM and Rattan Lal was its driver.
Down Passenger Special Train was given clearance at 1700 hours and came from
the side of Lahariya CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 637 Sarai. As per these entries
Ex.PW-102/A and Ex.PW-102/B dated 02.1.1975, the time of arrival of down
passenger Special Train is recorded as 1712 hours. In his cross-examination,
the witness admitted the suggestion of the defence that the Railway Minister
came to Samastipur by this Special Train.
556\. CW-4 Sh. Ved Prakash Gupta, the then Additional Private Secretary to Sh.
L.N. Mishra deposed that on 1.1.1975 he, Sh. L.N. Mishra and his brother Sh.
Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3) had gone from Delhi to Patna by Air and from Patna
they went to Darbhanga by State Aircraft. They went to Samastipur by Train.
Sh. L.N. Mishra had gone there for a meeting/public address for inauguration
of train from Samastipur to Muzaffarpur. Sh. L.N. Mishra got down from the
Saloon and went to Platform at meeting spot. He remained in the Saloon since
the programme was short of 10/15 minutes and then Mr. Mishra was to come back
to Saloon and they were to proceed for Muzaffarpur. When he was in the Saloon,
he heard a loud noise, came out and found that Sh. L.N. Mishra and Sh. Jagan
Nath Mishra were being brought to Saloon in injured condition. Sh. Jagan Nath
Mishra was bleeding from his legs and Sh. L.N. Mishra was injured but he could
not see any mark. Dr. Bhalla, Railway Doctor, who was present on the Railway
Station, immediately came to the Saloon. He started treating Sh. L.N. Mishra,
who was in the small cabin. The doctor did not tell any seriousness of the
injury, they decided to go to Danapur by the same train and on the way train
stopped at Patna where lot of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 638 supporters of Sh. L.N.
Mishra got down. Some supporters who were at Patna got in and son-in-law of
Sh. L.N. Mishra met him at Patna. Dr. Sahi, who was an eminent Surgeon, also
came into the Saloon and examined Sh. L.N. Mishra. There was doctor's strike
going on in Patna on that day and they went to Danapur by Saloon. At Danapur,
Sh. L.N. Mishra was removed to Military Hospital, where military doctors and
other doctors examined and treated him. He deposed that L.N. Mishra was
declared dead on 03.1.1975. The deposition of CW- 4 on these facts has not
been discredited by the accused persons in their cross-examination. In his
further cross-examination, CW-4 has deposed that decision to shift Sh. L.N.
Mishra was taken by CW-3 Jagan Nath Mishra.
557\. The cumulative scrutiny of the depositions of PW-3, PW-4, PW-65, PW-26,
PW-28, PW-53, PW-56, PW-57, PW-58, PW-60, PW-85, PW-109, PW-113, PW-127 and
CW-3, CW-4 and CW-5 demonstrate that on 02.01.1975, the Railway Minister Sh.
L.N. Mishra arrived at Platform No. 3 of the Railway Station Samastipur at
about 05.15 PM by a Special Train. He came to the Dais. Sh. L.N. Mishra
started delivering the speech, which lasted for about 20 minutes. At that
time, about 30/40 persons were present on the Dais. As he concluded and about
to step down, an object of black/grey colour was observed by PW-26 and PW-56
and immediately thereafter there was a blast on the Dais and many persons
suffered injuries. Neither of these witnesses had seen the culprit, who had
thrown the hand grenade CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 639 on the Dais, causing the blast.
PW-4 has also corroborated the deposition of the approver Vikram (PW-2) that
the unused bomb, which was dropped by the PW-2 on the Railway Track, while
running away from the spot after the bomb blast, was picked up by PW-4 and he
took it to his home and had shown it to PW-3, who started checking it and when
some hissing sound started coming out of the hand grenade, PW-3 threw it in
the store room of his house, where it exploded.
47) Construction of Rostrum.
558\. PW-48 Sh. M.K. Gupta deposed that during December 1974 to January 1975,
he was working as Assistant Engineer (Construction), at Samastipur in
Railways. He got constructed a Rostrum on the Platform between MG (Meter
Gauge) and BG (Broad Gauge) Lines for inaugural function on 2.1.1975 and the
construction work for the Rostrum was started one week prior to the date of
inauguration. Sh. Rajender Singh and Sh. Nandi were the inspectors of the work
and others assisted him in that work. The Divisional Engineer Sh. Pratap and
Senior Divisional Engineer with Head Quarter at Samastipur also supervised
this work. The dimensions of the Rostrum were approximately 20 feet x 16 feet
and he used to be present during construction of the Rostrum but not
throughout and most of the time Sh. Rajender Singh, Inspector of Works used to
be present at the spot during construction. Sleepers were spread on the top
and there was masonry work on all the four sides. The tarpaulin was spread on
those CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 640 sleepers and DARI and the GADDAS were spread. The
GADDAS were hired whereas tarpaulin and DARIS were Railway's property and DARI
and GADDA were spread over the sleepers on 02.1.1975. PW-48 further deposed
that he was present on BG Lines (Broad Gauge Lines) on 02.1.1975. There was no
tampering of the masonry work of the Rostrum till the function started on
02.1.1975. Identity slips were issued to the persons who worked on the
construction of the Rostrum. Slips like Ex.PW-48/A (Available in Folder R-31
as D-6) were issued before the function. It is worthy to reproduce the
contents of document Ex.PW-48/A (Ex.P-17) which reads as under:-
> "NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY The bearer is a Railway representative of Engineering
> Department and is allowed to attend the premises of the ceremony at
> Samastipur on 2.1.1975.
> Assistant Engineer (Con.), N. E. Railway, Samastipur."
It is also very pertinent to mention here that this document was recovered
from the coat pocket of the deceased Sh. Ram Kishore Singh Kishore at the time
of Inquest Proceedings Ex.PW-35/B for which a separate Production List
Ex.PW-35/C was prepared. The same is also endorsed on the document at
Ex.PW-48/A by separately recognising such endorsement by Sh. Uma Kant
Chaudhary (PW-35) CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 641 by marking it as PW-35/D.
559\. The contents of the document reproduced above makes it abundantly clear
that the bearer of such slip being Railway employees of its Engineering
Division was allowed to attend the premises of ceremony on 02.1.1975 at
Samastipur. Therefore, this document, which was retrieved from the person of
the deceased namely Sh. Ram Kishore Singh Kishore establishes that the said
person was present during the ceremony officially near the Dais and had become
an innocent victim of the bomb blast. The same is also being discussed while
appreciating medical evidence.
559\. In his cross-examination, PW-48 has denied a suggestion that Railway
Labour were around the Rostrum to do odd jobs even during the ceremony. This
suggestion fortifies the case of the prosecution and does not help the accused
in any manner to deny the event, turning of such an event into a tragedy, loss
of lives and injuries to several persons and blast, which caused such tragedy.
The line of cross- examination establishes the presence of Ram Kishore Singh
Kishore around the Dais in the capacity of a Railway employee and issuance of
such slips. Further, the cross-examination itself goes to prove that entire
version of PW-48 is credit worthy. There is no cross- examination to the
witness that there was no tampering with the Dais until the start of the
function on 02.1.1975.
Thus, the theory imagined by the accused and put forth in their CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 642 defence that explosive material could have been implanted beneath
the Dais does not stand to any reason.
48) Threat perception to the Minister?
560\. Ld. Defence Counsel have argued that it has come in evidence of PW-28
Sh. Brij Nandan Prashad, DIG that they had information that the group of
Karpuri Thakur and disgruntled Railway employees might try to disturb the
function. Ld. Defence Counsel referred the statement of PW-28 Sh. B.N.
Prashad, DIG, who deposed that during speech, there was black flag
demonstration towards Platform No.7. He did not allow Rajeshwar Rao, Advocate
as he had no Pass or Invitation Card and he had information of carrying a
demonstration at the Airport. PW-56 Sh. Umesh Prashad Singh deposed that
during the speech by the Railway Minister L.N. Mishra there was hooting from a
distance place. PW-58 Sh. Ajay Kumar testified that he saw more than 100
persons having black flags and raising slogans after arrival of the Railway
Minister at Platform no.1. PW-60 Sh. R.N. Rai deposed that he heard loud cries
from the side of Platform No.1. CW-2 Sh. Jiya Lal Arya, the then District
Magistrate, Samastipur deposed that he had not received any intelligence
report about danger to the life of Sh. L.N. Mishra. He admitted the suggestion
of the defence that when function was going on, there was a demonstration by
the students. There was no JP Movement in the function on that day. (JP refers
to movement by late Sh. Jai Prakash Narain). CW-5 Sh. Baleshwar Ram testified
that on that date there was no demonstration of JP movement CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 643 at the platform. PW-65 Sh. Vishwanath testified that there was
black flag demonstration at Railway Station, Samastipur on occasion of visit
of Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra at Samastipur on 02.1.1975. They were
raising slogans against the Railway Minister at the time of flag
demonstration. The black flag demonstration was at platform no.7. There were
slogans "Lalit Babu Jindabad" at the arrival of Railway Minister for the
function.
561\. Black flag demonstration or raising slogans is quite common in a
democratic setup, which is a mode of expressing protests against the
establishment. It has nowhere come in the statement of any of the witness
particularly police officials that there was any threat to the life of Sh.
L.N. Mishra. PW-65 Sh. Vishwanath, Deputy SP has specifically testified that
they have no secret information that the railway employees might make an
attempt on the life of the Railway Minister. CW-7 Sh. Jwala Partap Singh,
Officer Incharge, Chhapra GRP, who was on escort duty with Sh. L.N. Mishra,
deposed that he had no information of any threat to Sh. L.N. Mishra. The
defence has examined DW-10 Sh. O.P. Gupta, the then Private Secretary of Late
Sh. L.N. Mishra from 1964 till his death. He has been examined by the defence
to demolish the case of prosecution that there was no threat to the security
of Sh. L.N. Mishra. However, DW-10 has testified that he had no knowledge of
receiving any wireless message dated 30.12.1974 in their office regarding any
attempt on the life of Late Sh. L.N. Mishra. He is also not aware of any other
similar CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 644 message dated 24.12.1974. He did not read any
report expressing the danger to the life of Sh. L.N. Mishra.
Therefore, from the deposition of PW-28, PW-56, CW-2, PW- 65, CW-7 and DW-10,
it is reflected that there was no potential threat to the life of Sh. L.N.
Mishra, though there were reports that group of Karpuri Thakur and disgruntled
Railway employees might disrupt the function.
49) Security, mode of entry to the venue.
562\. As there were reports with the police that group of Karpuri Thakur and
some disgruntled Railway employees might try to disrupt the function and as
there were black flag demonstrations, raising of slogans at Platform No. 1 and
7, the security measures had to be resorted by the authorities concerned for
not only the smooth handling of the function but also maintaining law and
order since the Minister was to inaugurate. Tight security arrangements were
made by the local police at Samastipur Railway Station apart from RPF and
GRPF, who were deployed. Even the entry to the venue was restricted to only
such persons carrying Invitation Cards or exhibiting Badges/Passes issued by
Congress Sewa Dal in its name.
563\. I have already discussed in the chapter of "Macabre incident at
Samastipur dated 02.01.1975" that entry into the venue was restricted to the
holders of Passes/Badges or Invitation Cards. I have also returned a finding
that the accused themselves in the cross-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 645 examination of PW-57 had suggested and got produced a
Pass, which looked like the one recovered by the prosecution, which A-3 had
secured from the Congress worker for the safe ingress of the conspirators.
564\. PW-28 Sh. Brij Nandan Parshad, DIG deposed that purpose of their meeting
on 24.12.1974 in the chamber of Commissioner, Darbhanga was to finalize
security arrangements about visit of Railway Minister as they were to make
security arrangements. The purpose of his visit on 30.12.1974 to Samastipur
was to make security arrangements at Railway Station, Samastipur. He admitted
the suggestion of the defence that DAP, GRPF, RPF Jawans were deployed for
security with local police there. On his reaching the Samastipur Railway
Station on 02.1.1975, he came to know from SP that they were checking "Passes"
of the persons coming on the Dais and in the area of function. PW-65 Sh.
Vishwanath Deputy SP, Samastipur has also admitted the suggestion of the
defence that the local police officials, RPF and GRPF were on law and order
duty and for security purposes. He further admitted the suggestion of the
defence that the purpose of all police officials was to prevent the mischief
and to keep a watch on the movements of undesirable persons and others. No
person was allowed on the track of Broad Gauge Lines, which was to be
inaugurated. It was expected from the officials on duty that they would not
permit anyone going on Platform No.3 where the function was to be held without
having "Invitation CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 646 Card" or "Pass" for that. PW-60
Sh. R.N. Rai, Officer Incharge GRP, Siwaan, who was on ring round duty with
the Railway Minister, stated that the police and RPF officials were present
around the Munch. PW- 53 Sh. P.N. Tiwari, Chief Public Relation Officer,
North-Eastern Railway, stated that he noticed police moving on all sides of
the place of function before and during the time of function. PW-109 Sh. Mohan
Kumar Jha, a distant relative of Sh. L.N. Mishra, stated that 40/50 police
persons were present near the Dais.
565\. The defence has admitted in cross-examination of PW-3 Sh. Mahinder
Prasad Sahu, by giving the suggestion to PW-3 that no person without the
"Passes" was permitted to the venue and that there was strict checking of
"Passes" at that time at the Railway Station. PW-3 was not carrying any Pass
with him and he has explained that he was just a child at the time of incident
in question and for that reason there was relaxation in "Passes" and this fact
of relaxation of passes for the children, which PW-3 has testified in his
deposition, has also not been discredited and disputed. By giving this
suggestion, it is to be inferred that the PW-3 was present at the function and
his juvenility, which did not call for any verification of the Badges/Passes
with him are all admitted by the defence, who suggested as above.
566\. PW-57 Sh. Brij Mohan Sharma who had been a teacher and an ex-serviceman
and a member of local society formed to promote the development in the area
and an independent person came to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 647 Samastipur along with
8/10 persons to attend the function. The police officers did not allow them to
go to the platform. One Congress worker gave them one Badge of Congress Sewa
Dal each outside the Railway Station. He reached the platform where
inauguration was to be held based on a "Congress Sewa Dal Badge". He
identified the "Badge" Ex.P-8 and such type of Badge was given to him outside
the Railway Station. He was not permitted to go on the Rostrum but with the
assistance of their area MP Sh. Ram Bhagat Paswan (PW-85) he sat on the Dais
behind him. PW-57 brought the Sewa Dal Badge in the court on the date of his
deposition and on the request of accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand, it was
produced and exhibited as Ex.PW-57/DA. This Badge/Pass is like Ex.P-8. This is
in the size of 3.5"x 2.5" and "Congress Sewa Dal Samastipur" is printed in
Hindi. (This is available in Folder R-7). PW-57 further testified that similar
Badges was given to his 8/9 companions. They were seated on the chairs. He
does not understand the meaning of "Pass" but he and his companions had Sewa
Dal Badges, which they pinned on their chest. He deposed that Ex.PW-57/DA
might be called a "Badge" or a "Pass". The police was not permitting anyone in
the absence of "Passes" through the gate.
567\. PW-58 Sh. Ajay Kumar aged about 10 years at the time of incident
02.1.1975 and son of Incharge GRP PS Samastipur stated that he also came on
the Rostrum. He did not have "Invitation Card" or "Pass" and went there being
son of Incharge GRP PS Samastipur. He CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 648 was aware of the
fact that the persons having "Passes" would occupy the chairs and place on the
Rostrum. He saw the "Persons" going and showing "Cards" before they were
permitted to go inside the place of function. PW-85 Sh. Ram Bhagat Paswan,
M.P. admitted the suggestion of the defence that he commands respect in the
area. Some persons with him were not allowed to go to the Munch. Two persons
accompanied him up to some distance from the Munch but police officer asked
for a "Pass". PW-113 Sh. Raj Dev Rai, a Mukhiya of the Gram Panchayat of
Village Malikaur since 1966/68 stated that the "Passes" available with them
were checked at the entrance of the Railway Station. He sat on the chair lying
on the platform while Rama Kant Jha and Baleshwar Ram went to the Dais. In his
cross- examination, he answered that police used to check "Passes" before
allowing persons to go inside the place of function. On 1.1.1975 he had
discussion with Sh. Rama Kant Jha and Sh. Baleshwar Ram in Inspection Bungalow
about bringing of Sh. L.N. Mishra from Darbhanga and also that Congress Sewa
Dal Badges were printed and some workers would be using them. During the
talks, Sh. Rama Kant Jha told him that the Railway authorities have allowed
Sewa Dal workers to be present with Sewa Dal Badges.
568\. To further prove its case, the prosecution has examined the owner of the
Printing Press Sh. Virender Narain Poddar as PW-37, where the
Badges/Passes/Cards of Congress Sewa Dal like Ex.P-8 (similar card is
Ex.PW-57/DA) were printed. PW-37 Sh. Virender CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 649 Narain
Poddar deposed that his father owned Ajay Printing Press at Samastipur since
1970. He (PW-37) was a final year student of DHMS at Lahariya Sarai in the
year 1974-75 and used to look after the work of Printing Press in 1974-75 in
the absence of his father as his father did not attend to the work at Printing
Press from the last week of December 1974 to 03.1.1975 on account of illness.
He stated that Ex.P-9 is the badge of Congress Sewa Dal Samastipur, which was
printed in their press on 01.1.1975 on the request of Satender Prasad Singh @
Timmoo, who was known to him for a petty long time on account of his
association with his father. He was Mukhya Karyakarta of ruling Congress at
Samastipur and came to him in the printing press at about 12 noon on 01.1.1975
and requested for getting the printing on the same day. He told him that these
badges were needed in the inauguration function on 02.1.1975 and wanted
printing of 100 badges. He did not charge anything for the printing of 100
Badges. He (PW-37) prepared a sample badge while sitting in the press and got
printed the badges on the same day and one badge was retained by him as a
sample, which is Ex.P-9. He deposed that in the month of August 1976, CBI
officers came in the press and he was present there with his father. They have
given that sample badge Ex.P-9 to the CBI officers on that day, which was
taken into possession by them vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-37/A. He testified that
the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-34/A bears his signatures at point 'A' and that of his
father at point 'B'. His father has appended his signatures at Point "B" in
his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 650 presence.
569\. In his cross-examination at the instance of accused Gopalji and
Arteshanand, PW-37 answered that manuscript is obtained for printing and in
the instant case, Satender Prasad Singh gave them manuscript, but it could not
be tagged with Ex.P-9. The CBI officers did not ask him for the manuscript.
The sample badge Ex.P-9 was lying in the file. The sample badge Ex.P-9 was
given to the CBI officers, after taking out from that file. He could find only
one hole in the badge Ex.P-9. He has signed on the badge Ex.P-9. Print line
was not printed on the sample badge Ex.P-9. He had informed the CBI officers
that the sample badge was kept in a wire and it had a hole. He could not
remember whether in the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-37/A, there was a reference of hole
or not. He deposed that they were not maintaining regular books of accounts.
They have not entered printing of 100 badges at the instance of PW-37 in the
Order Book. There used to be two employees in their press at that time. The
block was not prepared by him but by someone else. He remembered the name of
one of the employees to be Kameshwar Pathak, who used to operate the machine.
His father was suffering from fever and Asthma. He testified that the paper
used for printing of badge, used to be called as card board. He bought card
board from the market on the same day. He denied the suggestion that Satender
Prasad Singh did not come to him or that the said Badge was not got printed in
their press. Despite opportunity, the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 651 other accused
Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi did not choose to cross-examine
the witness.
570\. In fact, this badge is wrongly mentioned as Ex.P-9 in the statement of
PW-37. Record reveals that this badge is, in fact, Ex.P-8, available in Folder
R-4. This Badge Ex.P-8 was initially exhibited without any objection of the
defence in the statement of approver PW-
2\. Subsequently, it was also proved in the statement of PW-131 Sh. M.P.
Singh, Assisting Investigation Officer and PW-81 Sh. Dev Narain Prasad. The
record further reveals that Ex.P-9 is, in fact, a "Prout" newspaper in the
record and it appears that due to typographical error, the exhibit mark of
this Badge Ex.P-8 was mentioned in the deposition of PW-37 as Ex.P-9 instead
of Ex.P-8.
571\. A careful scrutiny of the deposition of PW-37 reflects that he is an
independent witness. It is not shown whether he had any enmity with any of the
accused persons. His testimony that Sh. Satender Prasad Singh @ Timmoo was
Mukhya Karyakarta of ruling Congress party at Samastipur, was not shattered.
It is also not suggested that the Badge was printed at some other printing
press. The printing and existence of the Badge has also not been disputed by
the defence. The accused Gopalji had only given him the suggestion that the
Badge was not printed in their press and it is well settled principle of law
that a denied suggestion is not evidence. It is also not suggested by the
defence that such type of Badges were got printed subsequent to the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 652 function dated 02.01.1975 in order to create evidence. Moreover,
the similar Badge Ex.PW-57/DA was got produced from PW-57 by the defence
themselves in the court, meaning thereby that the existence of the Congress
Sewa Dal Badge was not disputed by the defence. If his evidence is read in
conjunction with the evidence of PW-2, PW-3, PW-57 and PW-113, it has to be
concluded that these Congress Sewa Dal Badges like Ex.P-8 and Ex.PW-57/DA,
were got printed from Ajay Printing Press at Samastipur belonging to PW-37 and
his father. I find that PW-37 is a truthful witness.
572\. PW-81 Sh. Devender Narain Prasad deposed that he has been running a
General Merchant Store at Gudri Bazaar, Samastipur since 1969\. He testified
that in August 1976, he had gone to the market for purchase of Ghee (Oil). On
the way, one officer from Delhi came and inquired from him whether there was
any press and he (PW-81) replied in the affirmative. The officer of Delhi
accompanied him (PW-
81) to Ajay Printing Press, where the press owner and his son were found
present. The officer inquired at the printing press, whether any Badge was
printed there and the owner told him that he will check-up the record. Then
the press owner took out the papers tagged in a wire and from under about
100/150 papers, he took out one Badge on which Congress Sewa Dal Samastipur
was printed. He deposed that he would be in a position to identify that Badge
since he had signed it. He deposed that Ex.P-8 is the same badge, which was
produced by the owner of the press and bears his signatures at point 'A' and
that of Sh.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 653 Shiv Narain Poddar, owner of the press at point 'B'
and his son Virender Poddar (PW-37) at point 'C'. He deposed that the document
Ex.PW-37/A (Seizure Memo) was prepared by the officer and bears his (PW-81)
signatures at point 'C'. He further testified that he had seen many persons
supporting such Badges, while going inside the Railway Station and coming out
of it, where a function was held at the Railway Station, Samastipur. That
function was about inauguration of Railway Line by Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra.
573\. In his cross-examination, PW-81 answered that Railway Station Samastipur
is at a distance of about two furlong from his shop. There was no function of
Congress at the Railway Station. However, the Railway Minister, who came for
inauguration of Railway Line, was of Congress Party. He further testified that
Badges like Ex.P-8 were seen by him for the first time on the day on which
Railway Minister L.N. Mishra came to Railway Station Samastipur for
inauguration of Railway Line. He had gone up to outside the Railway Station as
a spectator at about 04.00 PM and by that time the Railway Minister had not
arrived. He had read in the newspaper "Arya Vart" on 01.01.1975 about the
visit of the Railway Minister and arrival time of the Minster was mentioned as
01.00 PM and one boy told him at about 02.00 PM that Minister was not arrived
by that time. He had seen the persons sporting the Badge. He has denied the
suggestion that he had not gone to the printing press or that no badge was
produced by the owner of Ajay Printing Press to that officer in his presence
or that his signatures CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 654 on the documents were obtained in
the office or that he had not seen people sporting Badges like Ex.P-8 on the
date on which Sh. L.N. Mishra arrived for inauguration of the Railway Line at
Railway Station, Samastipur.
574\. On a close look on the deposition of PW-81, it is clear that he is an
independent person having no axe to grind against anyone and at par with
PW-37, he had spoken to the truth about the seizure of Pass Ex.P-8 from PW-37.
Thus, the prosecution has established the seizure of the passes like that of
the one, which the defence got produced in the cross-examination of PW-57.
Again, it is not shown as to why he deposed falsely. It is also not put to
PW-81 as to what enmity he had with the accused persons or as to what benefit
he (PW-81) would derive by deposing so. The defence has only given the
suggestions, which were denied by the witness and again at the cost of
repetition it is trite law that denied suggestion is not evidence. His
deposition that he had seen people entering the Railway Station Samastipur on
the date of ceremony of inauguration of Broad Gauge Line, sporting such type
of Badges, rather, supports the version of the defence, which they have put in
the cross-examination of PW-3 that there was strict security check and entry
was allowed only through "Passes". I find that the testimony of this witness
is trustworthy.
575\. PW-131 Sh. M.P. Singh, Deputy SP CIU (P) Branch, CBI deposed that he was
assisting Chief Investigation Officer Sh. H.L.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 655 Ahuja, Deputy SP as per his directions. He deposed
that on 28.8.1976, he went to Samastipur for tracing the press from where the
badges of Congress Sewa Dal were printed. He visited Ajay Printing Press after
making enquiry and met the owner of the press Shiv Narain Poddar and his son
Virender Narain Poddar and after making a search they produced before him one
badge of Congress Sewa Dal of Samastipur Ex.P-8 after taking out the same from
a wire, which he seized in the presence of one Dev Narain (PW-81) vide Seizure
Memo Ex.PW-27/A (In fact, the Seizure Memo is Ex.PW-37/A). He deposed that it
was signed by Virender Narain Poddar at point 'A', Shiv Narain Poddar at point
'B' and Dev Narain at point 'C' and his own signatures are appearing at point
'D'. He deposed that he also obtained the signatures of these persons on the
Badge Ex.P-8 at point 'A', 'B' and 'C'.
576\. In fact the Seizure Memo is Ex.PW-37/A and not Ex.PW-27/A which appears
to be a typographical error as the Seizure Memo was already exhibited as
Ex.PW-37/A in the statement of PW-37 Sh. Virender Narain Poddar and this
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-37/A is available in Folder R-12.
577\. In his cross-examination, PW-131 answered that he did not visit Congress
Office, before his visiting Ajay Printing Press. The registration of Ajay
Printing Press was in the name of Shiv Narain Poddar. He did not find any
order for getting the Badges of Congress Sewa Dal printed in the order book of
Ajay Printing Press. The order CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 656 book for the particular
period was not available. He had seen the record relating to the employees of
Ajay Printing Press. He had inquired from Ajay Printing Press as to why the
print line was not printed on the Badge Ex.P-8, which he incorporated in his
statement. Ajay Printing Press was situated in the New Market. He had examined
Satender Prasad Singh, a member of Congress Sewa Dal, but he did not produce
any such Badge before him. He admitted the suggestion that Congress Sewa Dal
was a political organisation. He explained that since Railway Minister was of
a Congress Party and that Party had also invited other persons, it did not
occur to him to make inquiry in this regard. In his further cross-examination,
PW-131 answered that Virender Nath Poddar (PW-37) was otherwise maintaining
order book, but the order book for the period from 08.08.1974 to 19.04.1975
was not available. He was maintaining accounts only on rough sheets. There was
no mention about printing of Badges in those rough accounts since no payment
was made for their printing.
578\. Scanning of deposition of PW-131 reflects that his testimony that he
visited Ajay Printing Press or met its owner and his son (PW-
37) in the presence of PW-81 on 28.08.1976 and made inquiry from them has not
been disputed by the defence. The accused persons have also not discredited
him that he had not seized the Badge Ex.P-8 from the owner of the Ajay
Printing Press. It is also not suggested that this Badge was got printed
subsequent to the inaugural function. PW-131 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 657 is a Senior
Police Officer and his testimony is worth inspiring confidence.
579\. From the totality of the above evidence on the subject and after
appreciating the evidence both ocular and documentary by various witnesses
discussed herein above, I am of the firm opinion that the prosecution was
successful to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that there was tight
security at the spot and venue owing to the visit of Railway Minister Sh. L.N.
Mishra for inauguration of Broad Gauge Line at Platform No. 3 between
Samastipur and Muzaffarpur. Police officers along with forces of GRPF and RPF
were deployed there. Railway authorities got printed 11000 Invitation Cards,
out of which about 6600 cards were sent/delivered throughout the country to
mark the historical event in the State. However, there were reports that a
group of Karpuri Thakur and some disgruntled Railway employees might disrupt
the function. Nevertheless, there was no threat perception to the life of Sh.
L.N. Mishra. There were black flag demonstrations and raising of slogans
against the Minister at Platform No.1 and 7 (not near the venue) at the time
of his speech, which is an usual protest in a peaceful and democratic manner.
Congress Sewa Dal badges, which are referred to as "Passes" or "Badges" or
"Cards" were issued/given by Congress workers. These Passes/Badges were pinned
by the audience on their attire near the chest for their entry to the venue.

50) Registration of FIR - on explosion at railway quarters.
580\. PW-142 Sh. Sarju Prashad Verma, the then Officer Incharge P.S.
Samastipur in January 1975, deposed that on 02.1.1975, he was on duty on
Platform No. 7, Railway Station, Samastipur. Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-34) was his
Officer. On that day, after the function, on the direction of his S.P., he
went to Railway Hospital, Samastipur to make arrangement for the injured and
came to know about bomb blast in the house of Mahadev Sahu and accordingly he
went to the house of Mahadev Sahu in Railway Colony with a constable and a
Jamadar. Mahadev Sahu met him there. He inspected the house of Mahadev Sahu.
He had gone inside the store of that house, where the explosion took place and
he did not find any injured there. He found the ceiling and all the walls of
that room were damaged and glass panes of windows on south wall were found
broken and he also found a hole in the wire-mesh of that window. There was a
hall towards each of that store in which he found pin of a hand grenade and a
lever besides bloodstains and three pieces of the Chappals stained with the
blood. He preserved the spot and prepared a writing which was sent to P.S.
Samastipur through constable Ram Dayal Singh No. 292 of CRP Force and an FIR
No. 1 of 1975 was registered in the P.S. Samastipur on his Rukka Ex.PW-142/A.
The matter was investigated by him and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 659 then it was
handed over to CID, Bihar. He deposed that this rukka Ex.PW-142/A is in his
handwriting and bears his signatures. He testified that ASI K.P. Singh was
working at PS Samastipur at that time and he had seen him writing and signing
and endorsement at point A on the said rukka is in hand of ASI K.P. Singh. He
also deposed that Ex.PW-142/B is the original FIR, which is in the hand of
said Sh. K.P. Singh with his signatures at point 'A'.
(This rukka Ex.PW-142/A and FIR Ex.PW-142/B are available in Folder R-7.)
581\. In his cross-examination, it is found that he recorded the statement of
Mahadev Sahu, one of the accused in the case He further replied that same
night at about 10.00 PM or 11.00 PM, he decided that Mahadev Sahu was not an
accused. He suspected seven persons to be responsible for keeping hand grenade
in the house, which exploded and he named them as accused in his rukka. The
case file titled as "State Vs. Mahadev Sahu & Others" of case No. 1 (1)/75, PS
Samastipur was brought by PW-148 on 16.01.1985 during the deposition of PW-142
Sh. Sarju Prashad Verma and after retaining the rukka Ex.PW-142/A and FIR
Ex.PW-142/B, the file was returned to PW-148. This is mentioned by my Ld.
Predecessor at Page No. 3544 and 3547 of deposition of PW-142.
582\. PW-145 Sh. Khusheshwar Singh, the then Mukhiya of Village Bahadurpur,
Harnoli, deposed that he used to visit Samastipur also. He deposed that he was
going on the road wherefrom he was called at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 660 the house of
Mahadev Sahu at about 05.00 PM or 06.00 PM. He further deposed that the house
of Mahadev Sahu was situated in the Railway Colony, Sam astipur and he was
taken by the policemen to the house of Mahadev Sahu to witness the seizure
under the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-145/A, which was prepared. He signed at point
'A'. The other witness Mahinder Singh at point 'B' and these proceedings took
place two days after the incident of L.N. Mishra.
(Seizure list Ex.PW-145/A is available in Folder R-2.)
583\. In his cross examination it is elicited that there were other houses in
the locality of Mahadev Sahu, but none was called there. He did not remember
how many articles were recovered due to lapse of time. The police did not get
the spot photographed in his presence. The proceedings were completed there in
about one or half an hour. The defence has not suggested that the articles
mentioned in the Seizure Memo Ex.PW-145/A were not recovered from the spot or
that the seizure memo was not prepared there. The defence has also not shown
whether the witness has any enmity with the accused. PW-145 is an independent
public witness and there is no reason to discard his testimony.
51) Scene of occurrence - Site plans.
584\. PW-139 Sh. Bipin Bihari Singh deposed that in January, 1975 he was
working as Section Officer in District Board, Samastipur. Sh. K.L. Pandey was
his Assistant Engineer at that time. On 05.1.1975, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 661 under
the instructions of District Engineer, Sh. Ranbrik Singh, this witness

scale of 1"=4'. It bears his signatures at point "A".
(These site plans Ex.PW-139/A & Ex.PW-139/B are available in Folder R-39)
585\. In his cross-examination it is noticed that he had prepared the rough
notes at the time of taking measurements at the spot which were destroyed by
him after the draft plans were prepared (about Ex.PW- 139/A). He was not told
about the place of incident and that is why he has not shown the same in the
draft plan Ex.PW-139/A. The height of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 662 the enclosure

Railway Station vide his site plan Ex.PW-139/A. He also proved the position of
house of Sh. M.D. Sahu vide site plan Ex.PW- 139/B. In his cross-examination,
the defence failed to unearth any incorrectness in the topography of Railway
Station, Samastipur and house of M.D. Sahu as shown by PW-139 Sh. Bipin Bihari
Singh in the site plans Ex.PW-139/A and Ex.PW-139/B.

also signed by CID officer in their presence. He deposed that he would be in a
position to identify seized articles. During his deposition, the material
objects seized were duly identified, which are consisting of one pillow
Ex.P-33, two bed sheets Ex.P-34 and Ex.P-35, one cotton mattress (gaddas)
Ex.P-36, and portion of tarpaulin Ex.P-37.

persons were standing. Sh. Suraj Prasad Singh was also sitting among the
public. He and Suraj Prasad were called by Darogaji, when they were among the
public. Suraj Prasad Singh used to sell books on the Railway Station. He did
not know what is the meant by base plug. He did not know the meaning of

that he would be in a position to identify those four sleepers. During his
deposition in the court, all these articles consisting of wooden sleepers at
Ex.P-38, Ex.P-39, Ex.P-40 and Ex.P-41 were identified. The cross- examination
of PW-73 reveals nothing to disbelieve him and the seizures.
590\. A scrutiny of the depositions of PW-72 and PW-73 fortify the seizures.
The cross-examination does not go to show that they were implanted and further
does not show that the seizure was effected from some other place. The
credibility of these witnesses has not been shaken in the cross-examination.
(Ex.PW-72/A and Ex.PW-73/A are available in Folder R-2)
591\. PW-52 Sh. Jagdish Prasad Sinha, the then ASI, GRP at Samastipur

CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 676
601\. A conjoint reading of the deposition of PW-72, PW-73 and PW- 51 reflect
that they visited the site of crime at Platform No. 3, Samastipur Railway
Station on 04.01.1975 and 05.01.1975, where apart from other articles like
mattresses, pillows etc., they found remnants of the bomb consisting of base
plug, striker with a spring, remnants of Ignitor Set, pin and lever and 40
pieces of cast iron splinters. Seizure list Ex.PW-72/A and Ex.PW-73/A were
prepared by the CID Officer. On the direction of the PW-51, those remnants of
the bomb were sent to the Controller of Explosive at Calcutta through PW-149.
At the spot, PW-51 has given his Preliminary Report Ex.PW-51/A. It is also
evident from the statement of PW-51 that he visited the house of Mahadev Sahu
on 04.01.1975 and there also he found similar remnants of the bomb and on his
directions those remnants were collected by the Police officials and the same
were also sent by a separate letter to the Controller of Explosive at Calcutta
through PW-149. As per the reports of the Chemical Examiner Ex.PW-51/B
pertaining to remnants collected from the Platform No. 3 of Samastipur Railway
Station and on chemical examination, he found items No. "D", "F" and "H"
containing T.N.T. (Tri-Nitro-Toluene). Similarly vide report Ex.PW-51/E
pertaining to remnants collected from the house of Mahadev Sahu at Samastipur
and on chemical examination, he found items No. "A" and "E" containing T.N.T.
(Tri- Nitro-Toluene). Both these reports of Sh. A. Ray, Assistant Chemical
Examiner have been proved to be in his handwriting by PW-51, who CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 677 had seen him writing and signing. Furthermore, PW-51 has also
given his opinion based on his spot inspection, remnants seen by him at the
spot of crime and report of Assistant Chemical Examiner, which are Ex.PW-51/C
(pertaining to Platform No. 3) and Ex.PW-51/F (house of Mahadev Sahu). Both
these opinions of the expert reveal that the remnants found at both the places
containing T.N.T. (Tri-Nitro- Toluene) and on explosion this could endanger
human life. The opinion expressed in the reports is not rebutted by any
evidence nor did cross-examination shatter the opinion of the expert that the
remnants were not collected from the spot.
53) Owning the cause of the crime.
602\. The prosecution has presented certain material before this court by way
of documentary evidence by which, another link in the chain of the events
could be attributed to accused persons charge sheeted. The documentary
evidence are Manuscript in Hindi Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1) and a printed pamphlet in
Hindi Ex.PW-20/A. The pamphlet and the manuscript were found in the office of
UNI, Patna Bureau on the very next day of the crime committed at the Platform
No. 3, Samastipur Railway Station. The evidence available on record regarding
the collection of the evidence and the ratification of the same through the
prosecution witnesses and linking it with the accused is to be analyzed in the
totality of the circumstances presented by the prosecution. This CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 678 documentary evidence was found in the office of UNI. In order to
establish the same, the prosecution has examined PW-20 Sh. Farzand Ahmad,
Staff Reporter of UNI, PW-21 Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha, Bureau Manager, PW-22 Sh.
Chander Mohan Mishra, Journalist attached to the Patriot and the Link and the
seizure of the same were conducted by Sh. K.N. Tiwari (PW-124), Inspector of
Police, CBI.
603\. PW-20 Sh. Farzand Ahmad deposed that he was working as staff reporter in
January 1975 in UNI, Patna Bureau and during those days Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha
(PW-21) was the Chief of their Bureau and both of them were working in the
same office. He knew Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22), who was special
correspondent of "Patriot" and "Link" papers at Patna. He testified that
"Patriot" is daily newspaper while "Link" is a weekly and both were published
from Delhi. In the month of January 1975, Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-
22) was having his office at Patna, who was a regular visitor to their office.
On 03.1.1975 (afternoon) at about 2.00 or 3.00 PM while he was present along
with Dhariya Nand Jha (PW-21) in his office, a manuscript Ex.PW-2/B and a
printed leaflet (Ex.PW-20/A) were seen by them and both these papers were
found tagged. He saw these papers during sorting process and he had shown them
to the Bureau Chief Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha (PW-21) who, after going through
those papers, asked him to keep the same with him and next day i.e. 04.1.1975,
Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22) came in their office. During discussion,
there was a reference of these two documents and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 679 the
same were shown to Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22), who had also gone through
the contents that day and sent a report for "Patriot" and "Link" but the
documents remained in his custody. He deposed that in July 1975, CBI officials
came to his office to enquire whether any material was received in their
office showing that anyone owned responsibility for L.N. Mishra murder case
and he replied that he would try to recollect. He (PW-20) took out old bundle
from the almirah and during checking, he found Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1) and Ex.PW- 20/A
in the bundle for January 1975 and these two documents were taken into
possession by CBI Officers vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW- 20/B which bears his
signatures at point A and that of Sh. D.N. Jha (PW-21) at point B and one Sh.
Dhaneshwar Singh at point C and CBI officials also obtained their signatures
on Ex.PW-2B and Ex.PW- 20/A at points A, B & C.
(Ex.PW-2/B is available in Folder R-4. Ex.PW-
20/A and Ex.PW-20/B are available in Folder R-13).
604\. The object of cross-examination by the accused Santoshanand and
Sudevanand of PW-20 seems to elicit from this witness that this press material
spoken to by the witness is implanted by the CBI. In a direct reply, this
witness had stated that it was never in his experience that anyone from the
CBI could come to their office and place the document on their table. It is
also elicited from this witness that he is unable to say as to who placed the
material from the public. It is CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 680 common prudence that the
Fourth Estate (Press and Media House) do have their drop-in boxes or the
receipt counters from where any material, which the public intend to get
published through the media are collected day in and day out. Anyone is free
to drop any material, which they intend to get published for which the media
houses generally do not issue any receipts nor do maintain any inward or
outward register. Furthermore, it is very important to note that by a catena
of decisions the Journalists are recognized of their immunity to reveal the
source of information. Keeping this in mind the cross- examination elicited
that "we as journalists do not give information to the police about the
material received by us and it was not signed" is to be understood. This
witness has further stated "we treat the press material as confidential unless
it is published". This answer goes totally negative to the idea of the cross-
examination. However, it is seen from the cross-examination that the
Journalists in house namely D.N. Jha, Chander Mohan Mishra had discussed about
these letters. Thus, the line of cross-examination does not go to shatter that
these material found in the office of UNI had emanated from there. The accused
could not elicit anything contrary to show that these letters sprang up from
somewhere else than UNI. Thus, this source of the same is proved on record as
emanating from UNI from where it was dropped by someone and collected during
investigation. The line of cross-examination, suggests that it was the CBI,
which got it planted in the office of UNI, does not find any ground, reason
being that CBI CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 681 came in picture only after 10.01.1975,
whereas these documents were dropped in the office of UNI on the next day of
incident i.e. 03.01.1975. On the other hand, it is elicited that PW-20 has
shown these letters to Chander Mohan Mishra when D.N. Jha mentioned about
these documents on 03.01.1975 and that these documents were in the almirah,
when Chander Mohan Mishra came to their office. The other accused have chosen
not to cross-examine this witness.

Students Association"
609\. PW-21 Dhariya Nand Jha deposed that in the year 1975, he was working as
Bureau Manager, UNI, Patna and Farzand Ahmad (PW-
20) was working as staff reporter in January 1975 in their office and both of
them used to sit in the same office. During those days Sh. Chander Mohan
Mishra (PW-22) was special correspondent for Patriot & Link papers at Patna
and he did not have his office. He (PW-22) often used to visit their office.
On 03.1.1975, between 2.00 and 3.00 PM, while he was present in his office at
Patna with Farzand Ahmad (PW-20), the documents Ex.PW-2/B and Ex.PW-20/A were
given to him that day by Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) and after a cursory look on
these two documents, he asked Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) to keep these two
documents with him. Next day on 04.1.1975, Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22)
came in his office and there was a general discussion among them about the
receipt of these two documents previous day in their office and these two
documents were shown to Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22) by Sh. Farzand Ahmad
(PW-20). These documents were returned by Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22)
after going through the same and he asked Sh. Farzand Ahmad (PW-
20) to keep them in his custody. He did not give any news item CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 687 through UNI in respect of these two documents as there was no
signature of any proper authority thereon and there was no print line on
Ex.PW-20/A. He deposed that these two documents were taken into possession by
CBI officials in their office vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-20/B and CBI officials
came in their office for tracing the news published in "Link weekly" and these
two documents were given to CBI officials by Sh. Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) in his
presence and that of UNI correspondent of Samastipur Sh. Dhaneshwar Singh. He
testified that Seizure Memo Ex.PW-20/B bears his signatures at point B with
date 19.7.75 and documents Ex.PW-2/B and Ex.PW-20/A were signed by him, Sh.
Farzand Ahmad (PW-20), and Dhaneshwar Singh at points B, A & C respectively.
610\. The cross-examination revolved around minute details and it only
fortifies that the CBI visited the office of PW-21 and inquired about any
documents from the witness. The witness volunteered that CBI firstly visited
Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra and only through him, after getting the information
that a news item was published in "The Link", which the CBI had shown to PW-21
also. This witness had replied the cross-examination that he did not inform
the CBI about the publication in "The Link". It is also elicited that Chander
Mohan Mishra was not present when CBI visited. The cross-examination of this
witness further creates a bonding link with the evidence of PW-20 that Chander
Mohan Mishra earlier met PW-20 before publishing the news item in "The Link".
Certain unwanted questions were put to this CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 688 witness
whether the manuscript contained the name of L.N. Mishra, the date, the
mention of a pistol and the number of people, taking part in the incident, the
sender of the manuscript, etc. When the document itself is self-explanatory,
the line of cross-examination does not go to discredit the version of this
witness. In the cross-examination, the accused further stressed the need of
identification of these documents, which the witness had identified. Thus the
line of cross examination does not go to show that these documents are
fabricated or implanted. The non-mentioning by him about the print line
unavailable in his previous statement Ex.PW-21/DA and this omission does not
strike at the root of the credibility of this witness since this witness had
sustained the extensive cross-examination. The accused Gopalji and Ranjan
Dwivedi did not choose to cross-examine this witness.
611\. PW-22 Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra deposed that in January 1975, he was
attached to daily paper "Patriot" and weekly magazine "Link" and he has been
working for "Link weekly" since the year 1960\. He knew Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha
(PW-21) who was his friend and a co-professional and in January, 1975, Sh.
D.N. Jha (PW-21) was having his office at Fraser Road, Patna and he often used
to visit Sh. D.N. Jha (PW-21) in his office in connection with his
professional work, and on 4.1.1975, he visited his office and he found Sh.
D.N. Jha (PW-21) and Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) in their office and Sh. D.N. Jha
(PW-21) told him that a very interesting paper was received in connection with
L.N. Mishra murder case and on his request, Sh.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 689 D.N. Jha (PW-21) asked Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) to give
him the paper who had shown two leaflets Ex.PW-2/B and Ex.PW-20/A and after
going through the same he returned to Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) and prepared a
report and sent the same to the paper "Link Weekly" and the material in
respect of these two documents was published in the news item encircled with
red pencil on page 11 of "Link Weekly" dated 12.1.1975 and this news item is
the same which was sent by him from Patna for publication and the news item is
Ex.PW-22/A and the portion in inverted coma in this news item were taken by
him from these two documents Ex.PW-2/B and Ex.PW-20/A.
612\. This witness was grilled at length in cross-examination, but could
elicit only futile and unwanted swagger like the questions relating to the
Chairman of "The Link" Organisation suggesting Ms. Aruna Asaf Ali and this
witness belonging to CPI and the leaflet Ex.PW-20/A being against the
communists and the witness not mentioned about the communists in publication.
Further unwanted cross-examination is done to elicit that this Journalist
along with D.N. Jha were at Samastipur, when L.N. Mishra visited and they sat
in the Press enclosure and the same were replied in the positive by the
witness. The cross-examination is un-understandable as regards the witness
travelling along with L.N. Mishra to Patna in a Saloon. Further cross-
examination of this witness revealed that the CBI officers did not contact him
prior to the publication of the news item in "The Link" weekly. The entire
cross-examination does not go to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 690 shake the testimony of
the witness about his perusing the documents retrieved at UNI office, the
discussion among the journalists and the subsequent publication of the story
in "The Link" magazine dated 12.01.1975. This Journalist was unnecessarily put
to shame by suggesting that he claimed air fare from the court. It is also
elicited that due to the paucity of time, he travelled by the air otherwise he
would leave Patna one day earlier. He was very humble in submitting that in
case the court was not to grant him air fare, the balance amount would be
borne by him. This shows his politeness and sobriety. Further, he is neither a
stock witness nor an interested witness and he has no axe to grind against the
accused persons. The prolix cross- examination, which runs into 10 pages by
two accused spread on two dates, does not help them to disbelieve this
witness, who was not cross-examined by other three accused persons despite
opportunities.
613\. As deposed by PW-22, the news item Ex.PW-22/A published in the weekly
magazine "LINK" dated 12.1.1975 at page 11 reads as under: -
> "Threat to P.M.
> Who killed Lalit Narayan Mishra? This is not as important a question as who
> got him killed.
In this connection, the reaction of a section of the youth of Bihar who hailed
the assassination was revealing. The day he died, a handwritten leaflet was
distributed to the press by the so-called CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 691 "Sashatra
Krantikari Chhatra Sangh" in Patna which said, "The Samastipur incident was
only the first effective attack by the armed revolutionaries on the status
quoists and the corrupt administrative machinery." It asked Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi "to give up repressive measures" which would prove "costly" for
her. "If she does not change her present attitude she will not die the death
of a martyr but of a sinner (papi)." In an attached printed leaflet, it said
that corrupt officials, minister, legislators and communists would all have to
face death."
614\. These two documents Ex.PW-2/B and Ex.PW-20/A were taken into possession
by PW-124 Sh. K.N. Tiwari. He deposed that in January 1975, he was working as
Inspector of Police with CBI at Shilong, and in January 1975, on the
instructions from the Head Office of CBI, New Delhi, he went to Samastipur on
10.1.1975 in connection with the investigation of L.N. Mishra case and
reported to Harbans Singh, SP, CBI who directed him to assist Sh. H.L. Ahuja,
Chief Investigation officer of the case and he was acting under the specific
instructions of Sh. Ahuja. He stated that on 19.7.1975, he seized Hindi
handwritten pamphlets Ex.PW-2/B from Sh. Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) of UNI vide
Seizure Memo Ex.PW-20/B which bears CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 692 his signatures at
point D, signatures of Sh. Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) at point A, of Sh. D.N. Jha
(PW-21) at point B and Sh. Dhaneshwar Singh at point C. This seizure memo
Ex.PW-20/B dated 19.7.1975 is available in Folder R-13 and as per this memo,
two documents i.e. manuscript in Hindi bearing "SASHATRA KRANTIKARI CHHATRA
SANGH- PRESS SAMAGRI" (one sheet) and one printed leaflet of Sashstra
Krantikari Sangh were seized from Sh. Farzand Ahmad (PW-20) and this is signed
by Sh. Farzand Ahmed at point A, Sh. D.N. Jha at point B and Sh. Dhaneshwar
Singh at point C. CBI officer Sh. K.N. Tiwari signed it at point D.
615\. The cross-examination of this witness is lengthy with regard to his
association in the investigation on different dates, but for the purposes of
the subject in topic we are concerned with the proceedings conducted by him
during investigation, while seizing these two documents Ex.PW-2/B and
Ex.PW-20/A under seizure memo Ex.PW- 20/B. The cross-examination simply
fortifies that the Seizure Memo was prepared in the presence of the witness
namely Farzand Ahmad and that when the Inspector visited the UNI office,
Farzand Ahmad and D.N. Jha were present. The cross-examination does not go to
discredit the Seizure and the proceedings of the day, while the material
concerning the manuscript and the pamphlets were seized. The evidence of this
witness corroborates the say of PW-20 Farzand Ahmad, PW-21 D.N. Jha and PW-22
Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra.

54) Tracing the handwriting/author of the manuscript Ex.PW-2/B.
616\. Having thus found that the seizure of these two documents corroborated
with the oral testimony of witnesses PW-20 to PW-22 and PW-124, now the
pivotal question is to find out as to how to link the same to the accused
persons. The document-manuscript is very significant and vital to connect the
link to the accused Santoshanand. This document is vital since the same was
dropped in the office of UNI, Patna, the very next day of the gruesome
incident at Samastipur Railway Station having a quotation in the manuscript
Ex.PW-2/B referring to Samastipur bomb blast.
617\. PW-2 deposed that Santoshanand used to write in his presence and he can
identify his signatures and writing. He stayed with Santoshanand up to the end
of 1972. He further testified that the Press Samagri encircled red Ex.PW-2/B
(Q-1), being the manuscript seized, which is referred in the preceding
paragraphs and the writing Ex.PW- 2/C (Q-2), being the scribbling found on the
Note Book of Ashok Lodge/Ashok Niketan, Patna, proved through PW-23, are in
the handwriting of accused Santoshanand. He deposed that during his 3 years
stay at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi, he used to work on press and
distribute the publications and whatever was written in the handwriting of
Santoshanand, used to be composed by him for the press. He also identified the
writing in Hindi encircled with red mark Q-3 on slip Ex.PW-2/M (also
Ex.PW-33/A) in the handwriting of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 694 accused Santoshanand.
This slip Ex.PW-2/M (also Ex.PW-33/A) was found recovered in the search
carried at the house of accused Gopalji at Chautham on 17.05.1975 by PW-134 in
the presence PW-91.
618\. PW-2 deposed that by the end of 1969, he received a telegram from
Aacharya Advetanand to go to Ranchi. Aacharya Advetanand was the Financial
Secretary of Proutist Forum of India, a wing of Anand Marg and its head office
was at D-41, South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi. PW-2 stayed at Ranchi for a
day or two and was brought to New Delhi by Advetanand. On the ground floor of
D-41, South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi, there was a printing press and on
1st Floor, the office of Proutist Forum of India was there. The same was also
used for boarding and lodging. At New Delhi, he was introduced to Santoshanand
by Advetanand. At that time, accused Santoshanand was working as Editor of
newspaper 'Prout' and magazine 'Education & Culture'. PW-2 testified that
accused Santoshanand used to write in his presence and thus able to identify
his signatures and handwriting. He also identified the writing Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2)
in blue circle and the words are in the handwriting of Santoshanand which are
available in the copy book pertaining to Ashok Niketan Ex.P-6 (also Ex.PW-
23/A). At page no.25 of his deposition he further testified that the Slip
Ex.PW-2/M (Q-3) (also Ex.PW-33/A) is in the handwriting of Santoshanand. He
identified the signatures written as 'Vinod' and the date written beneath the
signatures as '15.11.73', which could also be read as '74' to be in the
handwriting of accused Santoshanand. Perusal CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 695 of the
document Ex.PW-33/A=Ex.PW-2/M (Q-3) clearly reflects the date to be
15.11.1974.
619\. The minute scrutiny of the lengthy cross-examination of PW-2, running
into 350 pages, does not shatter the deposed ability of PW-2 in recognising,
identifying the signatures, the handwriting of Santoshanand. There has been no
cross-examination on his competence. There is no cross-examination to put
forth that the writings found in Ex.PW-2/B, Ex.PW-2/C and Ex.PW-2/M are not in
the handwriting of accused Santoshanand. Furthermore, it is pertinent to note
that before the advent of computers into the printing technology, it was
always the compositors who used to do all the composition by sorting out the
individual letters of different fonts from the stock of metal letters or by
typing them lino-type, so that the matter is composed and made ready for
printing. It is the primary duty of a compositor to choose and compose the
letters according to the manuscript. The compositor used to compose all the
letters into several lines and would produce a galley. Such galleys are taken
out and by printing ink and replica is produced. Thus the initial copy is
produced before it is sent for proof reading. After such proof reading, the
compositor used to correct the same. In such circumstances, a compositor was
fully acquainted of the scribbling, be it any manner or speed of any author.
Alas ! The days of composition, galleys, printing copy, proof reading and all
such wonderful methods of precision in writing and publication went into
oblivion after the new era of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 696 computers and information
technology. In the instant case, the occupation of PW-2 in the printing press
of the publications "Prout" and "Education & Culture", was that of a
compositor as deposed by him. Accused Santoshanand had been the editor of both
these publications. Thus, PW-2 was very much acquainted, familiar and
knowledgeable with regard to every type of scribbling by his editor
Santoshanand. Thus, the testimony of PW-2 that he was capable of identifying
the writings of Santoshanand is highly trustworthy, dependable and cogent.
This observation is warranted in the background of the accused having not
cross-examined with regard to his competency and there being no cross-
examination elicited to establish that the writings found in Ex.PW-2/B,
Ex.PW-2/C and Ex.PW-2/M are not in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand.
Thus, this court can simply do away with any other evidence as superfluous,
however the prosecution has examined some more independent witnesses also for
establishing the handwriting of Santoshanand, which is discussed in the
succeeding Paras.
620\. The testimony of the approver Vikram (PW-2) that the above said three
documents i.e. Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-2/M = Ex.PW-33/A
(Q-3) are in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand has been corroborated by
PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar. PW-68 deposed that he was posted in Delhi as
Finance Secretary. He was also designated as Press and Paper Secretary of PFI.
Earlier there was office at premises No. C-18, South Extension-I, CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 697 New Delhi and then in D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi.
Santoshanand, Editor of Hindi Prout, was residing at D-41, South Extension-I,
New Delhi. (He correctly identified accused Santoshanand in the court.) He
deposed that many workers including Vikram (PW-2) used to distribute the
publications and he remained with Santoshanand till he left the organization
in January 1972. Santoshanand was working under him and during this period, he
had seen Santoshanand writing and signing and he used to write both in English
and Hindi and he would be in a position to identify the handwriting of
Santoshanand. He identified the writing of Santoshanand Ex.PW-2/B (in Hindi),
Ex.PW-2/C (in English), Ex.PW-33/A (in Hindi), mark A-1 to A-72 in Kohinoor
Exercise Book mark P-22. (Ex.PW-2/B has writing Q-1, Ex.PW-2/C has writing Q-2
and Ex.PW-33/A=Ex.PW-2/M has writing Q-3.)
621\. This witness was also subject to lengthy cross-examination by the
accused persons including Santoshanand running into 25 pages spread over four
dates. However, nothing could be elicited in his cross-examination on the
vital points for which he was examined by the prosecution. The accused persons
including Santoshanand have not demolished the competency of this witness to
identify the handwriting and signatures of accused Santoshanand. They have
also not discredited the witness that he has wrongly identified the persons
and the writing of accused Santoshanand on Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2)
and Ex.PW-2/M = Ex.PW-33/A (Q-3). The accused CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 698 persons have
not denied his status in the cult previously as Chief Training Secretary, Sewa
Dharam Mission, Varanasi and then at the headquarter at Purulia or Area
Secretary in Bombay or Finance Secretary and Press and Paper Secretary, while
posted in Delhi. They have also not discredited his deposition that accused
Santoshanand was working under him. They have also not discredited that Vikram
used to distribute the publications. The accused Santoshanand has admitted his
residence at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi by suggesting to the witness
in his cross-examination that he did not have any quarrel with Santoshanand
Avadhoot and others while residing in premises D-41, South Extension, Part-I,
New Delhi, before he left the cult and he had cordial relations with
Santoshanand and others during his stay there. Therefore, prosecution through
the testimony of PW-68 has undoubtedly proved that the documents Ex.PW-2/B
(Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-2/M = Ex.PW-33/A (Q-3) are in the handwriting
of accused Santoshanand.
622\. The testimony of the approver (PW-2) has further been corroborated by
PW-33 Ujjawal Prakash on the point that the documents Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1),
Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-33/A (Q-
3) are in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand. PW-33 deposed that he
joined Anand Marg at Bhagalpur in the year 1957. In the year 1970, Anand Murti
sent him to Delhi as Office Secretary of PBI with office at 13, Feroz Shah
Road at the residence of Shashi Ranjan MP. Accordingly, he came to Delhi in
January 1970 and remained there up CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 699 to October 1971.
He deposed that there was one office of PFI (Proutist Forum of India), a wing
of Anand Marg at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi and he was a frequent
visitor to this premises. The "Prout" daily and magazine "Education & Culture"
used to be published from D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi. Santoshanand was
the Editor of this paper "Prout" and he had seen Santoshanand writing and
signing and would be in a position to identify the writing and signatures of
accused Santoshanand, present in the Court. His earlier name was Ghanshyam
Parsad and Sh. Narinder Narain Verma was his father. Accused Santoshanand used
to bring material for "Prout" paper and also used to do writing in his
presence and he had seen Santoshanand writing in English and Hindi and
identified writings at Ex.PW-2/B (Q-
1), PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-33/A (Q-3) to be in the handwriting of accused
Santoshanand. He also correctly identified the accused Santoshanand in the
court.
623\. In the cross-examination of PW-33, running into 13 pages, the accused
Santoshanand and Sudevanand did not challenge his capability to identify the
person and handwriting of accused Santoshanand. They have also not challenged
and discredited him on his identifying the handwriting of accused Santoshanand
on Ex.PW- 2/B (Q-1), PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-33/A (Q-3). However,
interestingly, accused Ranjan Dwivedi has given him only a suggestion in the
cross-examination that he is not acquainted with the handwriting and
signatures of accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 700 The defence has not discredited the testimony of
PW-33 that he had been a frequent visitor to the premises D-41, South
Extension-I, New Delhi, where the office of PFI, a wing of Anand Marg, was
situated or that Santoshanand was its Editor or that previous/original name of
Santoshanand was Ghanshyam Prasad or that his father's name was Narinder
Narain Verma or that his father was working in LIC and as a Journalist. They
have also not challenged his capability of identifying Santoshanand,
Sudevanand, Gopalji and Ranjan Dwivedi in the court.
624\. Therefore, in view of this discussion referred in the preceding Paras,
the say of approver PW-2 Jaldhar Dass @ Vikram @ Subir and corroborated by
PW-68 Sudhir Kumar Basedar and PW-33 Sh. Ujjawal Prakash, establishes beyond
reasonable doubt that the manuscript Ex.PW-2/B (Q1) is in the handwriting of
accused No.1 Santoshanand. This manuscript Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1) along with a
printed leaflet Ex.PW-20/A was found in the office of UNI at Patna on the
succeeding day i.e. 03.01.1975 after the gruesome incident at Samastipur
Railway Station on 02.01.1975, and this manuscript starts by referring
Samastipur Bomb Blast and suggesting further threat to the Government, the
then Prime Minister Late Smt. Indira Gandhi, Officers of C.I.D, Police and
Courts etc. and all those who oppose their cult. The recovery of this document
in the office of UNI Patna has also been established by PW-20 Sh. Farzand
Ahmad, PW-21 Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha, PW-22 Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra and PW-124
Sh. K.N. Tiwari, Inspector of Police, CBI. The possibility of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 701 fabricating this document is also ruled out as the crux of the
document Ex.PW-2/B was reported by PW-22 in the renowned magazine "The Link"
on 12.01.1975 Ex.PW-22/A, which is supported by the oral testimony of the
Author.
625\. I have already referred the deposition the approver PW-2, who had
identified the writing and signatures as "Vinod" on the Slip Ex.PW-2/M (Q-3)
containing writing in Hindi and encircled with red mark Q-3, to be in the
handwriting of accused Santoshanand. I have also referred the testimony of
PW-68 corroborating the deposition of PW-2 as he has also identified the same
to be in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand. I have also referred the
deposition of PW-33, who has also identified the said slip in the handwriting
of accused Santoshanand. However, PW-33 deposed that the portion with red
pencil Ex.PW-2/N and marked Q-3 is Ex.PW-33/A. This slip is available in
Folder R-5. In fact, this document Ex.PW-33/A had already been exhibited as
Ex.PW-2/M in the testimony of PW-2. Obviously, there is a clerical error, when
the red portion of the slip Q- 3 was described to be Ex.PW-2/N in his
statement instead of Ex.PW- 2/M and a separate exhibit number was also given
as Ex.PW-33/A. The record further reveals that actually Ex.PW-2/N is a
document of Jaipur Central Co-operative Bank, which has been proved by the
deposition of PW-2 and PW-63 Sh. D.K. Maharishi. This Slip Ex.PW- 2/M (also
Ex.PW-33/A) is pasted on a plain paper and the pasted slip is encircled with
the red pencil and below the writing, the handwriting CBI Vs. Santoshanand

> questioned documents Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-2/M (Q-
3), GEQD PW-43 Sh. B. Lal has given his opinion that these writings are in the
handwriting of the same person. Now I refer the relevant witnesses on the
subject.
628\. PW-32 Sh. Satnam Singh deposed that on 11.8.1975 he was working as MM,
Delhi. On that day, Santoshanand @ Ghanshyam Prasad son of Narendra Narayan
Verma was produced before him for taking his specimen writing by some
officers. Santoshanand did not raise any objection and gave his specimen
writing of his own in his presence on three sheets and he appended his
certificate and those sheets are Ex.PW-32/A1 to Ex.PW-32/A3. His correct
certificate with his signature appears at Point "A" on all these three sheets.
In his cross-examination on behalf of accused Arteshanand and Gopalji, he
admitted their suggestion that a person is always produced in the court with
an application in which request is made for obtaining specimen writing and
order is passed on such application to the effect that the person is willing
to give specimen writing and thereafter his specimen writing is taken.
However, despite opportunity, the accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan
Dwivedi did not choose to cross-examine the witness. It is not at all
suggested to the witness that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 704 specimen writing of accused
Santoshanand was obtained forcibly or by inducement or allurement. The
testimony of PW-32 has not been discredited by the accused persons including
Santoshanand that Ex.PW-32/A-1 to A-3 does not bear the specimen handwriting
of accused Santoshanand. Therefore, from the testimony of PW-32, it has been
proved that sheets Ex.PW-32/A-1 to A-3 were voluntarily written by the accused
Santoshanand bearing his specimen handwriting.
(Ex.PW-32/A-1 to Ex.PW-32/A3 are available in Folder R-13)
629\. PW-29 Sh. K.K. Dey, the then Extra Assistant Director with M/s.
Waterways Irrigation & Navigation Directorate, deposed that on 10.7.1975, on
the direction of his Director, he accompanied CBI men to their office in R.K.
Puram. Accused Santoshanand was called there and thereafter Dy. SP dictated to
Santoshanand, who had written the writing on nine or ten sheets in his
presence and he (PW-29) has signed all these sheets. These sheets were also
signed by his colleague Sh. Naresh Kumar. The witness has identified those
nine sheets which are Ex.P-79 (9 sheets) in the summoned file of Sessions Case
No. 9 of 1976\. The file was brought from Hon'ble High Court brought by LDC
and copies thereof are Ex.PW-29/A (9 sheets). He identified accused
Santoshanand in the court and stated that at that time he was not sporting the
beard, long hair and mustaches. In his cross- examination, he answered that he
was sitting on one side of the same table on which Santoshanand was sitting
while writing. He had seen CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 705 Santoshanand writing in his
presence. He has denied the suggestion that these papers were not written by
Santoshanand in his presence.
(Ex.PW-29/A is available in Folder R-15)
630\. PW-39 Sh. Rajinder Thukral deposed that in July 1975, he was working as
Officer Grade-I with State Bank of India, R.K. Puram Branch, New Delhi. In
July, 1975, Dy. SP Sardari Lal, CBI met their Branch Manager, who deputed him
and his colleague Sh. B.K. Tuteja. Sh. Rajender Thukral, inter-alia, deposed
that specimen handwriting of Santoshanand were taken in his presence and that
of Sh. B.K. Tuteja by Sh. Sardari Lal, Dy. SP. He would be in a position to
identify Santoshanand and identified him correctly by pointing towards him. He
also deposed that at that time accused Santoshanand was in plain clothes and
not wearing BHAGWA dress and he did not raise any objection in giving his
specimen writing. He identified the writing Ex.PW-39/A-1 to Ex.PW-39/A-10,
which accused wrote in his presence and that of Sh. B.K. Tuteja. (Here it is
pertinent to mention that learned predecessor of this Court, who recorded
deposition of PW-39, has corrected statement of PW-39 at page No.889 under his
initials from Ex.PW-39/A-1 to Ex.PW-39/A-10 as Ex.PW-39/L-1 to Ex.PW-39/L-10.
However, exhibits mark on the specimen writing remained the same Ex.PW-39/A-1
to Ex.PW-39/A-10 under the signatures of my learned predecessor). He
identified his signatures and that of Sh. B.K. Tuteja on all three documents.
In his cross- examination by accused Ranjan Dwivedi, PW-39 answered that CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 706 Santoshanand was given blank full scape paper.
Despite opportunity, PW-39 was not cross-examined by other accused persons
including Santoshanand. It is not suggested that Ex.PW-39/A-1 to Ex.PW-39/A-
10 do not bear the specimen handwriting of accused Santoshanand.
(Ex.PW-39/A-1 to Ex.PW-39/A-10 are available in Folder R-13)
631\. The opinion of GEQD dated 19.9.1975 Sh. B. Lal is Ex.PW- 43/J (available
in Folder R-14). PW-43 Sh. B. Lal has compared the questioned writing
Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW- 33/A=Ex.PW-2/M (Q-3) with the
specimen writing of the accused Santoshanand Ex.PW-32/A-1 to Ex.PW-32/A-3 (3
sheets) and Ex.PW- 39/A-1 to PW-39/A-10 (S-19 to S-31) and vide his report
Ex.PW-43/J, he found that the person who wrote the writing stamped and marked
as S-19 to S-31, S-32 to S-44 also wrote the writing similarly marked and
stamped Q-1, Q-2 and Q-3. PW-43 proved his report Ex.PW-43/J and he also
deposed that the person (Santoshanand) who wrote the writing S-19 to S-31
(Ex.PW-32/A-1 to Ex.PW-32/A-3 and Ex.PW-39/A-1 to Ex.PW-39/A-10) also wrote
the writing Q-1 (Ex.PW-2/B), Q-2 (Ex.PW-2/C) and Q-3 (Ex.PW-33/A=Ex.PW-2/M)
and all the writings agree in general and in individual habits such as
movements which is wrist and forearm combined, pen presentation, pen pressure
which is medium and smooth, skill which is superior, relative size and spacing
and proportion of letters and similarities in individual habit writing are
also found in both the writings.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 707
632\. The Ld. Defence Counsel argued that the action of Investigation Officer
in obtaining specimen writing and signatures of accused persons during
investigation of the case amounts to violation of Article 20 (3) of the
Constitution of India and they have relied upon a ruling of the Bench of two
Hon'ble Judges of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sukhvinder Singh and others vs.
State of Punjab, (1994) 5 SCC 152. They have also relied upon a full bench
judgment of our own Hon'ble High Court in Sapan Haldar and Another vs. State,
191 (2012) DLT 225 wherein it has been held that during investigation of a
case, neither can the Investigation Officer obtain a sample writing of the
accused nor can even a Magistrate so direct.
633\. The Ld. Special P.P. on the contrary clarified the position of law by
referring to a judgment of the Larger Bench of Eleven Hon'ble Judges of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Bombay vs. Kathikalu Oghad, (1962) 2 SCR 10
wherein it was held that by giving impressions or specimen handwriting,
accused person does not furnish evidence against himself and does not violate
Article 20 (3) of the Constitution. This judgment has been followed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court again in State of U.P. vs. Boota Singh and others AIR 1978 SC
1770 and relevant extract (Para 41) reads as under :-
> "........ Before closing this part of the case, we might advert to an
> argument advanced before us by Mr. Mulla regarding the specimen signature of

> So when an accused person is compelled to give a specimen handwriting or

> 162, Criminal Procedure Code.
> In view of this decision of the Court, Mr. Mulla did not pursue the point
> further."
634\. Hon'ble Supreme Court has also followed these judgments recently also.
In its celebrated judgment titled as State (N.C.T. of Delhi) vs. Navjot Sandhu
@ Afsan Guru 2005 (11) SCC 600, the relevant observations found at Para No. 18
of the judgement calls for attention as under: -
> ".........This conclusion was reached by the High Court even after excluding
> the evidence of PW-23, Principal Scientific Officer who confirmed that the
> signatures on the delivery receipt-Ext. PW-1/6 tallied with his specimen
> signatures. In this context, a contention was raised before the High Court
> that in view of Section 27 of POTA, specimen signature should not have been
> obtained without the permission of the Court. In reply to this contention

> Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 710

> this contention advanced by Mr. Gopal Subramanium......................."
635\. The latest judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court on the point is Rabindra
Kumar Pal @ Dara Singh v. Republic of India 2011 (2) SCC 490 and straight
question before Hon'ble Supreme Court was as to whether in cases prior to
amendment in Cr. PC in 2005, the I.O. has power to obtain specimen writing and
Hon'ble Supreme Court answered it in the affirmative and relevant Para reads
as under:-
> "35. Another question which we have to consider is whether the Police (CBI)
> had the power under the Criminal Procedure Code to take specimen signature
> and writing of A3 for examination by the expert. It was pointed out that
> during investigation, even the Magistrate cannot direct the accused to CBI
> Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ

> case of M.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi
> and Ors., (1954) SCR 1077. After adverting to various factual aspects, the
> larger Bench formulated the following questions for consideration:
"2. ... ... On these facts, the only questions of constitutional importance
that this Bench has to determine are; (1) whether by the production of the
specimen handwritings - Exs. 27, 28, and 29 - the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 712
accused could be said to have been 'a witness against himself' within the
meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution; and (2) whether the mere fact
that when those specimen handwritings had been given, the accused person was
in police custody could, by itself, amount to compulsion, apart from any other
circumstances which could be urged as vitiating the consent of the accused in
giving those specimen handwritings. ... ...
4\. ... ... The main question which arises for determination in this appeal is
whether a direction given by a Court to an accused person present in Court to
give his specimen writing and signature for the purpose of comparison under
the provisions of section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act infringes the
fundamental right enshrined in Article 20(3) of the Constitution.
The following conclusion/answers are relevant:
10\. ... ... Furnishing evidence" in the latter sense could not have been
within the contemplation of the Constitution- makers for the simple reason
that
\- though they may have intended to protect an accused person from the hazards
of self-
incrimination, in the light of the English Law on CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 713 the
subject - they could not have intended to put obstacles in the way of
efficient and effective investigation into crime and of bringing criminals to
justice. The taking of impressions or parts of the body of an accused person
very often becomes necessary to help the investigation of a crime. It is as
much necessary to protect an accused person against being compelled to
incriminate himself, as to arm the agents of law and the law courts with
legitimate powers to bring offenders to justice. ...
11\. ... ... When an accused person is called upon by the Court or any other
authority holding an investigation to give his finger impression or signature
or a specimen of his handwriting, he is not giving any testimony of the nature
of a 'personal testimony'. The giving of a 'personal testimony' must depend
upon his volition. He can make any kind of statement or may refuse to make any
statement. But his finger impressions or his handwriting, in spite of efforts
at concealing the true nature of it by dissimulation cannot change their
intrinsic character. Thus, the giving of finger impressions or of specimen
writing or of signatures by an accused person, though it may CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 714 amount to furnishing evidence in the larger sense, is not
included within the expression 'to be a witness'.
12\. ... ... A specimen handwriting or signature or finger impressions by
themselves are no testimony at all, being wholly innocuous because they are
unchangeable except in rare cases where the ridges of the fingers or the style
of writing have been tampered with. They are only materials for comparison in
order to lend assurance to the Court that its inference based on other pieces
of evidence is reliable. They are neither oral nor documentary evidence but
belong to the third category of material evidence which is outside the limit
of 'testimony'.
16\. In view of these considerations, we have come to the following
conclusions :-
(1) An accused person cannot be said to have been compelled to be a witness
against himself simply because he made a statement while in police custody,
without anything more. In other words, the mere fact of being in police
custody at the time when the statement in question was made would not, by
itself, as a proposition of law, lend itself to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 715 the
inference that the accused was compelled to make the statement, though that
fact, in conjunction with other circumstances disclosed in evidence in a
particular case, would be a relevant consideration in an enquiry whether or
not the accused person had been compelled to make the impugned statement.
(2) The mere questioning of an accused person by a police officer, resulting
in a voluntary statement, which may ultimately turn out to be incriminatory,
is not 'compulsion'.
(3) 'To be a witness' is not equivalent to 'furnishing evidence' in its widest
significance; that is to say, as including not merely making of oral or
written statements but also production of documents or giving materials which
may be relevant at a trial to determine the guilt innocence of the accused.
(4) Giving thumb impressions or impressions of foot or palm or fingers or
specimen writings or showing parts of the body by way of identification are
not included in the expression 'to be a witness'. (5) 'To be a witness' means
imparting knowledge in respect of relevant facts by an oral statement or CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 716 a statement in writing, made or given in Court or
otherwise.
(6) 'To be a witness' in its ordinary grammatical sense means giving oral
testimony in Court. Case law has gone beyond this strict literal
interpretation of the expression which may now bear a wider meaning, namely,
bearing testimony in Court or out of Court by a person accused of an offence,
orally or in writing.
(7) To bring the statement in question within the prohibition of Article
20(3), the person accused must have stood in the character of an accused
person at the time he made the statement. It is not enough that he should
become an accused, any time after the statement has been made." In view of the
above principles, the procedure adopted by the investigating agency, analyzed
and approved by the trial Court and confirmed by the High Court, cannot be
faulted with. In view of oral report of Rolia Soren, PW 4 which was reduced
into writing, the evidence of PW 23, two letters dated 01.02.2002 and
02.02.2002 addressed by Mahendra Hembram (A3) to the trial Judge facing his
guilt coupled with the other materials, we are CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 717 unable to
accept the argument of Mr. Ratnakar Dash, learned senior counsel for Mahendra
Hembram (A3) and we confirm the conclusion arrived by the High Court."
636\. In view of the consistent view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Navjot
Sandhu @ Afsan Guru's case (supra), Kathikalu Oghad Case (Supra) and Dara
Singh's case (supra), investigating officer has not committed any illegality
in obtaining the specimen writing and signatures of the accused during
investigation. Here it is relevant to refer Article 141 of the "Constitution
of India" which reads as under:-
> "Article 141 - Law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts:
> the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within
> the territory of India."
637\. It is mandated upon every court of law, the tribunals throughout the
country to follow the rulings and the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court. Thus, in the light of the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
the arguments advanced by the defence that the accused was compelled to give
the specimen writings violating the law, cannot be borrowed to declare the
acts of investigation as opposed to law. Furthermore, it is pertinent to note
that in the cross- examination of Magistrate before whom the specimen writings
were obtained, nothing is elicited to show that the person writing the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 718 specimen was pressurized, compelled to scribe and further that
the scribbling were not that of the accused Santoshanand.
638\. Be it as it may, there has been ample evidence on record to connect the
handwriting on the incriminatory documents Ex.PW-2/B, Ex.PW-2/C and Ex.PW-2/M
(also Ex.PW-33/A) collected by the prosecution are in the handwriting of
accused Santoshanand, which is proved by the evidence of approver PW-2 and
corroborated by PW- 19, PW-33 and PW-68. Thus, any amount of debate on the
legality of obtaining the specimen handwriting of the accused and comparing it
with the questioned documents does not arise nor would wittle down the case of
prosecution.
639\. The writing on Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-2/M (also
Ex.PW-33/A i.e. Q-3) have been proved to be in the handwriting of accused
Santoshanand as discussed herein before by the testimony of PW-2 Sh. Vikram @
Jaldhar Dass and corroborated by PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar and PW-33 Sh.
Ujjawal Prakash. The writing on Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) is further proved by PW-23 Sh.
Ashok Kumar to be in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand. Manuscript
Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1) which is proved in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand
further lends credence to the criminal conspiracy and attack on the then
Railway Minister Sh. L. N. Mishra on 02.1.1975. This Hindi manuscript
Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1) along with a printed Hindi pamphlet Ex.PW-20/A was thrown in
the office of UNI, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 719 Patna next day i.e. 03.1.1975.
These were found on 03.1.1975 by the staff reporter of UNI, Patna Sh. Farzand
Ahmed (PW-20) at about 2.00 PM or 3.00 PM while he was present with Chief of
their Bureau Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha (PW-21). PW-20 Sh. Farzand Ahmed has shown
both these documents to Sh. Dhariya Nand Jha (PW-21), who after going through
these documents asked Sh. Farzand Ahmed (PW-
20) to keep them with him. Next day, i.e. 04.1.1975, they had shown both these
documents to Sh. Chander Mohan Mishra (PW-22), who was attached with Delhi
paper 'Patriot' and weekly paper 'Link'. Thereafter, PW-22 on going through
both the documents, he scripted a report which was published in due course in
the paper 'Link Weekly' dated 12.1.1975 which is Ex.PW-22/A. PW-2 has proved
the writing at Ex.PW-2/C as in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand, which
is corroborated by PW-33 Sh. Ujjawal Prakash and PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar
Basedar. This is also further proved by PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar, in whose Lodge
Ashok Lodge/Niketan, accused Santoshanand took a room on rent under fake name
of "Vinod/Binod Kumar" on 28.12.1974 at the rate of Rs.55/- and at that time
in the Note Book Ex.P-6 (also Ex.PW-23/A) he has written his name and address
Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2). The handwriting of accused Santoshanand Ex.PW- 2/C (Q-2) in
English and deposition of PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar corroborates the testimony of
approver PW-2 that secret meetings used to take place in Ashok Lodge/Niketan,
Patna, where accused Santoshanand took a room on rent till they were arrested.
PW-23 Sh.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 720 Ashok Kumar has also identified PW-2 Vikram, accused
Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Arteshanand in the court and stated that they
used to address "Vinod Kumar (i.e. Santoshanand) as "Boss". This independent
witness PW-23 Ashok Kumar thus corroborates the deposition of approver PW-2
Sh. Jaldhar Dass @ Vikram @ Subir, which disclose that all the directions have
been issued by accused Santoshanand and how he used to influence the Anand
Margies. As per the entries in the note book Ex.P-6 (also Ex.PW-23/A) Binod
Kumar (i.e. Santoshanand) stayed there from 28.12.1974 till June 1975 and
entries of payment of rent/lodging charges are reflected from January 1975 to
June 1975 @ Rs.55/- per month which are Ex.PW-23/A-2 to Ex.PW-23/A-8. Another
document Ex.PW-2/M (also Ex.PW-33/A) (i.e. Q-3) has been proved to be in the
handwriting of accused Santoshanand by deposition of PW-2 Vikram @ Jaldhar
Dass @ Subir which is corroborated by deposition of PW- 33 Ujjawal Prakash and
PW-68 Sudhir Kumar Basedar. This slip was recovered from the house of accused
Gopalji at the time of his house search carried on 17th May 1975 at 5 A.M. by
PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha, Inspector, IB, Patna, in the presence of two
witnesses including PW-91 Sh. Parsu Ram Singh and in this slip also, accused
Santoshanand mentioned his name as "Binod Kumar" and requested to send
Rs.3,900/- through bearer of the slip Sh. Bharatji on 15.11.1974. Bharatji is
none else but accused Sudevanand as deposed by the approver PW-2 and his
deposition reveals that that Sudevanand has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 721 changed his
name as Bharat has not been discredited in his cross- examination by the
defence. This conclusively proves the involvement of accused Gopalji in the
criminal conspiracy and this corroborates the testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 that
Gopalji was also a part of conspiracy and meeting of revolutionary group used
to take place at his house at Chautham, Distt. Monghyer and farm house at
Tilihar and used to be attended by accused persons Santoshanand, Sudevanand,
Gopalji, Arteshanand and approver Vikram; Arms and ammunitions were collected
there. As referred earlier in detail, while dealing with issue of search
carried out at the house of accused Gopalji, this Slip Ex.PW-2/M (Ex.PW-33/A)
/ Q-3 was one of those documents which was recovered from the house of accused
Gopalji at that time by PW- 134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha on 17.5.1975 vide Seizure
Memo Ex.PW-91/A. The recovery of the Slip Ex.PW-2/M, which is in the
handwriting of accused Santoshanand, from the house of accused Gopalji
reflects the connectivity among accused Santoshanand @ Binod, Gopalji and
Sudevanand @ Bharatji pursuant to the criminal conspiracy. As per the contents
of the Slip, accused Santoshanand, while writing his name as Vinod, has
requested to send him Rs.3900/- on 15.11.1974 and this only suggests that it
is for procuring the arms and ammunitions to achieve their motive of killing
certain persons mentioned herein before, to get their cult head released, was
being financed by accused Gopalji. The writing on the Note Book Ex.P-6, which
is also exhibited as Ex.PW-23/A of the Ashok Lodge/Ashok Niketan, Patna CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 722 contains a writing Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) and this has been
identified and proved in the handwriting of Santoshanand by the approver PW-2,
further corroborated by PW-33 and PW-68.
640\. Here it is relevant to mention at the cost of repetition that this
handwriting Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) was written by accused Santoshanand in the
presence of PW-23 Sh. Ashok Kumar, an independent witness, in whose Ashok
Lodge/Ashok Niketan, Santoshanand introduced himself as Binod Kumar and on
asking of Ashok Kumar, in his presence, accused Santoshanand has written his
address Ex.PW-2/C (Q-2) in their Note Book Ex.P-6 = Ex.PW-23/A. PW-23 has also
identified that person as Santoshanand in the court and his testimony was not
discredited. This writing of accused Santoshanand Ex.PW- 2/C also contains the
date as 28.12.1974 and as per the entry in the Note Book Ex.PW-23/A-2,
Santoshanand started living there from 28.12.1974 at a rent of Rs.55/- per
month and continued to reside there until 08.06.1975 having the last entry in
the name of Vinod Kumar dated 08.06.1975 Ex.PW-23/A-8. Witness PW-23 has also
deposed that the accused Sudevanand, Arteshanand and Vikram used to come in
the Lodge and they used to address Santoshanand as "Boss". PW- 23 has
identified not only Santoshanand but also Sudevanand, Arteshanand and Vikram
in the court correctly. His capacity to identify them was never discredited.

641\. In his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, while replying question No.
129 at Page No. 45 that the document Ex.PW-2/B is in his handwriting, to which
the accused Santoshanand has replied that he has not written any document like
Ex.PW-2/B with his hand and while in police custody he was made to sign
certain papers and he does not know whether it is one of them. It is evident
that the question was concerning the circumstances about the writing on the
document Ex.PW-2/B to be in his handwriting, to which accused Santoshanand
evaded and falsely blamed the police by accusing them that he was made to sign
certain papers, while in police custody. He had talked about signing of the
documents and not the handwriting. Further, while replying question No. 130 at
Page No. 46 of his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC put to him that the
writing on Ex.PW-2/C in the Copy book of Ashok Niketan Ex.P-6 is in his
handwriting, accused Santoshanand has replied that this is false and incorrect
and the writing was not in his handwriting. Similarly, he denied the writing
Ex.PW-33/A (which is also Ex.PW-2/M) while replying question No. 224 at Page
No. 77. All these three documents Ex.PW-2/B (Q-1), PW2/C (Q-2) and Ex.PW-33/A
(Q-3) have already been proved in the handwriting of accused Santoshanand.
This explanation of accused Santoshanand to the question for the circumstances
appearing against him by way of the above proved documentary evidence is
straight denial. The corroboration is to be looked into somewhere, which I
have already discussed above. This straight denial of a proved fact by CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 724 way of documentary and ocular testimony of the witnesses is to be
counted as providing a missing link for completing a chain of circumstances as
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rohtas Kumar Vs. State of Haryana,
2013(4) SCC 434 following its earlier judgment State of Maharashtra Vs.
Suresh, 2000 (1) SCC 471. Similar view has been taken by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Jagroop Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2012 (11) SCC 768.
                        56) Incriminatory   documentary       evidence
                        against A-3.
642\. Although the ocular testimony of PW-5 and PW-6 decisively corroborates
the testimony of PW-2 with regard to A-3 Ranjan Dwivedi arriving at
Samastipur, a day earlier i.e. on 01.01.1975 accompanied A-1 and A-2 by bus
from Muzaffarpur and awaited the arrival of his mother and sister-in-law, who
were to come from Sitamarhi by train and he having requested PW-6 to arrange
for reservation of three tickets to Delhi for the next day, still this court
is presented with documentary evidence to prove this facts alleged. The
prosecution alleges these facts to connect A-3 with the conspiracy by
arranging entry Passes for his co-conspirators to the venue. Hence, the
appreciation of documentary evidence is inevitable, which is being ventured
hereunder.
643\. The Reservation Slip duly filled-in by A-3 for reservation of tickets to
him, his mother and sister-in-law in the presence of PW-6 is CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 725 already discussed. However, PW-40 Sh. R.K. Ghai deposed that in
the year 1975, he was working as Head Clerk at Samastipur Railway Station. On
02.1.1975, he was on duty from 06.00 AM to 02.00 PM. The Requisition Slip
Ex.PW-6/A bears his initials at point 'A'. It was for reservation of three
berths by Assam Mail for 02.1.1975 from Samastipur to Delhi in the name of R.
Dwivedi, mother of R. Dwivedi and third Tara Devi. He signed and put his
initials at point 'A' on Ex.PW-6/A at about 12.00 noon on 02.1.1975. Assam
Mail used to start from Barauni and one first class-cum-second class coach and
one three tier sleeper coach used to be attached to 20 Down, Mithila Express
from Samastipur which used to be attached to Assam Mail at Barauni Railway
Station and these coaches were for New Delhi. These reservations were for
three tier sleepers. He knew Sh. G.P. Gupta (PW-54), the Reservation
Supervisor at Samastipur Railway Station and worked with Mr. Gupta and saw him
writing and signing and identified his signatures on Mark PW-40/A. This
document is Seizure Memo dated 04.8.1975 and later on it was exhibited as
Ex.PW-54/A (Available in Folder R-13) in the statement of PW-54 Sh. Ganesh
Prashad Gupta. In his cross-examination by accused Ranjan Dwivedi, PW-40
admitted the suggestion that in the Requisition Form Ex.PW-6/A, passenger has
not mentioned the date of submitting the form. It also does not bear the date
under his initials. To a question whether a form was given to him on
01.01.1975 and not on 02.01.1975, PW-40 deposed that as far as he remembered
it was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 726 not given on 01.01.1975. He also deposed that
the exact time of booking can be ascertained from the entry in the register of
reservation. Despite opportunities, the other accused persons did not opt for
his cross-examination.
644\. PW-54 Sh. Ganesh Prashad Gupta deposed that in the year 1975 he was
working as Reservation Supervisor at Samastipur Railway Station, and
Requisition Slip for reservation Ex.PW-6/A bears initials of Sh. R.K. Ghai
(PW-40), Reservation Clerk, at point 'A' and this was handed over by him to
CBI vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-54/A (Mark PW-40/A). He stated that Inspector R.P.
Sinha of CBI had signed this Seizure Memo in his presence at point 'B'. He
deposed that Reservation Counter used to be opened at 06.00 AM and closed at
8.00 PM. One Reservation Clerk used to be on duty from 06.00 AM to 02.00 P.M.
and other one from 2.00 P.M. to 10.00 P.M. and after closure of the counter at
8.00 P.M., the Reservation Clerk used to complete his miscellaneous work
during two hours. There was one counter for 1st class and 2nd class at Railway
Station, Samastipur and in those days seats could be got reserved for trains
10 days in advance. Cross-examination of PW-54 revolved around the incidents
post 1975 initially, however the accused Gopalji and Arteshanand in their
cross- examination could elicit that R.K. Ghai (PW-40) was on duty at the
relevant time. Certain explanation is also drawn from the cross- examination
that out of the three tickets reserved two tickets were for Ex-Samastipur to
Delhi and one from Muzaffarpur to Delhi and that is CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 727 why
there is change in the series of numbers. It is elicited that there is a
ticket in the name of Tara bearing No. 03796. The reservation farms are
generally preserved for a period 3 to 5 years. It is found in the cross-
examination that Ex.PW-54/A is emanated from the reliable quarters i.e.
Divisional Office of Samastipur and that this witness had given a receipt
while obtaining this register. A suggestion was made to this witness that this
witness made a false statement to help the prosecution, which was denied. It
is noteworthy that accused Ranjan Dwivedi, Santoshanand and Sudevanand did not
cross-examine the witness despite the opportunity. Thus, the cross-examination
adopted by accused Gopalji and Arteshanand even if read on behalf of other
accused, does not destabilize the version of PW-54 about the aspect of the
reservation of tickets by the reservations form.
645\. PW-126 Sh. R. P. Sinha deposed that he remained posted as Inspector,
CBI, Patna from 08.8.1967 to February 1976. On instructions of Sh. K. Prakash,
SP, CBI, Patna, he went to Samastipur on 04.8.1975 for part investigation of
L.N. Mishra murder case. He went to Reservation Office, Railway Station
Samastipur on 4.8.1975 from where he took into possession Requisition Slip for
reservation Ex.PW-6/A from Sh. G.P. Gupta (PW-54), Reservation Supervisor,
vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-54/A (available in Folder R-13) which is in his hand
and bears his signatures at point 'B' and signatures of G.P. Gupta at point
'A'. (Reservation Slip Ex.PW-6/A is available in folder R-13). This witness
was cross-examined on behalf of accused CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 728 Gopalji and
Arteshanand. This fortifies that this witness was instructed by the SP of CBI
to seize the Reservation Slip from Samastipur Railway Station and that in the
instruction letter time is not mentioned. Non-mentioning of time in the letter
of the SP is inconsequential. It is elicited that G.P. Gupta (PW-54) produced
the reservation slip and he examined the reservation clerk. There was no
instruction to procure the reservation register. Ex.PW-6/A was not found
tagged in a wire but was taken from a bundle. The line of cross- examination
does not suggest that the reservation slip seized is fabricated. It is again
noteworthy that accused Ranjan Dwivedi, Santoshanand and Sudevanand did not
cross-examine the witness despite the opportunity. Thus, the cross-examination
adopted by accused Gopalji and Arteshanand even if read on behalf of other
accused, does not shatter the version of PW-126 about the aspect of seizure of
reservation form and deposition of reservation clerk.
646\. I have perused the documentary evidence Ex.PW-6/A, the Reservation Slip,
which is available in Folder R-13. As per this reservation slip three berths
in third class by 85 UP Assam Mail for 02.01.1975 from Samastipur to New Delhi
were reserved in the names of three passengers namely (1) R. Dwivedi, (2) M/o
R. Dwivedi, and (3) Tara Devi at Samastipur at 11.30 AM and in the column of
applicant, Ranjan Dwivedi has signed and beneath his signature he furnished
his address as "C/o V.K. Ojha, PP RPF, SPS". This document is marked as Q-6 by
GEQD for the purpose of comparing CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 729 handwriting of accused
Ranjan Dwivedi at Point A and B. The seizure memo dated 04.08.1975 Ex.PW-54/A
concerning the Reservation Slip Ex.PW-6/A is signed by PW-126 and PW-54 at B
and A respectively. This is also available in Folder R-13. In his statement
under Section 313 Cr. PC, the accused Ranjan Dwivedi admitted that he obtained
reservation for 3 berths i.e. for himself, his mother and Bhabhi and
Reservation Slip Ex.PW-6/A was filled up by him under his signatures.
647\. Collated with the documentary evidence, the ocular testimony of
witnesses PW-40, PW-54 and PW-126 and the approver's testimony (PW-2) and that
of PW-6 makes the fact indelible that accused Ranjan Dwivedi, Santoshanand and
Sudevanand were very much present along with approver Vikram (PW-2) on the day
i.e. 02.01.1975 at Samastipur Railway Station and that accused Ranjan Dwivedi
had applied in writing the requisition for railway tickets for himself, his
mother and Tara Devi through the help of PW-6. This fact further cements the
version after going through the address furnished of the applicant-Ranjan
Dwivedi in Ex.PW-6/A as that of "C/o V.K. Ojha, PP, RPS, SPS" (PW-6). Thus,
the presence of above accused including Ranjan Dwivedi is highly believable
without any room to doubt.
648\. PW-47 Sh. Krishan Kumar Shukla, Traveling Ticket Examiner, Railway,
Kanpur deposed that on 03.1.1975, he was on duty in the second class sleeper
of Assam Mail from Kanpur to New Delhi and as CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 730 per the
Reservation Chart, his duty was in Coach No. 3954 and Reservation Chart Mark
PW-47/A was delivered to him at Kanpur. He deposed that after Assam Mail left
Kanpur, he checked the passengers already present in that coach with reference
to Reservation Chart Mark PW-47/A. He checked up the number of the tickets
available with the passengers travelling in that coach and after tallying the
number of the tickets and names from the passengers with the Chart, he put the
tick mark against entries in the Reservation Chart. He stated that Mark
PW-47/A is in two sheets and the entries made by him in the Chart are in blue
ink and tick marks in blue ink in the Chart are also in his hands and the red
ink entries and carbon entries on Mark PW-47A were already found when it was
given to him. He deposed that as per the entries in the chart on berth no. 2,
3 & 5 of Coach 3954, he found the persons mentioned therein traveling from
Samastipur to New Delhi and the ticket numbers of passengers on berth No. 2, 3
& 5 matched with the numbers mentioned in the chart and this chart was
deposited by him on reaching New Delhi Railway Station in the office of Head
Ticket Collector and this coach No. 3954 was from Samastipur to New Delhi.
This Reservation Chart Mark PW-47/A for coach no. 3954 dated 2.1.1975 of train
no.85-UP Assam Mail, (three tier sleeper) is in respect of 50 passengers and
name of passenger no. 2, 3 & 5 are mentioned as Sh. R. Dwivedi, M/o Dwivedi
and Ms. Tara Devi respectively. This witness is cross-examined only on behalf
of Ranjan Dwivedi. It is elicited that the charts are prepared in triplicate.
It is CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 731 elicited that he was given the carbon copy and the
same is Mark PW- 47/A, which dealt with berth numbers 2, 3 and 5 Samastipur to
Delhi. The answer elicited that he could not say whether these tickets at 2, 3
and 5 were purchased simultaneously or not, does not go to help the accused in
any manner since this witness was not the issuing clerk or the reservation
clerk at Samastipur but a TTE. It is also elicited that he never worked as
booking clerk. This witness expressed his inability to identify the
passengers. The aspect of examining this witness is only to establish that
after the reservation whether the persons, who got reserved, travelled or not.
The inability to identify the passengers in no way helps the accused.
Therefore, the cross-examination of this witness remained futile on record. On
the other hand, the genuineness of Mark PW-47/A is never impeached. Moreover,
this Reservation Chart is prepared in due course of its business by the
Railway and is a public document and has been proved by PW-47 Sh. Krishan
Kumar Shukla, Traveling Ticket Examiner and hence it is admissible in evidence
and this is now exhibited as Ex.PW-47/A. (Available in Folder No.R-1).
649\. PW-132 Sh. B.R. Puri, Dy. SP, CBI deposed (Page 2980) that during
investigation of RC No. 01/1975, on 14.7.1975 under orders of Chief I.O.
Deputy SP Sh. H.L. Ahuja, he seized reservation chart and relevant memos of
2-tier and 3-tier of 85-UP Assam Mail leaving Barauni on 2.1.1975 and reaching
Delhi on 3.1.1975 and these were all 10 sheets. He deposed that these were
seized by him from Sh.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 732 Shobha Ram, Assistant Head Ticket Collector, New
Delhi Railway Station vide seizure memo Ex.PW-132/A (available in Folder R-1)
which he correctly prepared in his hand and it was signed by Sh. Shobha Ram at
point 'A' in his presence and his signatures are at point 'B'. He stated that
Mark PW-47/A (now Ex.PW-47/A) consisting of 10 sheets was seized by him from
Sh. Shobha Ram which were signed by him at the time of its seizure. The cross-
examination did not swerve the seizure of the reservation chart, which is
otherwise proved by PW-47.
650\. The ocular and documentary evidence of this witness establishes another
link in the circumstances that Ranjan Dwivedi, who was found along with the
accused above named at the spot of Samastipur, had left and travelled in the
train in accordance with the reservation, he obtained at Samastipur to go to
Delhi.
57) Search at the house of A-3.
651\. PW-132 Sh. B.R. Puri, Dy. SP, CBI deposed that he had been associated
with CBI since 1958 and remained associated with the investigation of these
cases from May 1975 to September 1975 and Dy. SP H.L. Ahuja was the Chief
Investigating Officer. He remained associated with the investigation of RC No.
11 of 1975 relating to attack on Chief Justice Ray and Dy. SP Sardari Lal was
the Chief Investigating Officer of RC No.11 of 1975 and he took part in the
investigation of the aforesaid two cases under the direction of the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)

while associated with the investigation of the case RC No.11/75 (relating to
attack on Chief Justice A. N. Ray) Chief IO Dy. SP Sardari Lal directed him to

and Mr. Vishnu Dutt Kumar (PW-115) went to 31, National Park, New Delhi where
Ranjan Dwivedi was residing on the second floor and conducted the search of
the house in the presence of these two witnesses. At that time, Ranjan Dwivedi
was present in the house. He recovered documents and clothes from the house of
Ranjan Dwivedi vide Seizure Memo dated 06.7.1975 Ex.P- 137 (available in the
summoned file) which he prepared correctly and the photocopy thereof is

the Folder R-7. On the search list also reference of the case No. 11/75 is
mentioned on its top). It bears signatures of Laxmi Narain Vishnu Dutt Kumar
(PW-
115) at point 'A' and of Ranjan Dwivedi at point 'B'. It also bears his
signatures and that of Sh. Narula. (As per this copy of Seizure Memo dated

also seized by him from the house of Ranjan Dwivedi and he obtained the
signatures of both the above said public witnesses on all the written pages of
these diaries. He deposed that writings Mark Q-13, Q-13-A, Q-14 and Q-14-A in

Mark Q-20 in diary Ex.P-127 besides other writings were existing at the time
when it was seized. The juxtapose of the writing Ex.PW-43/AA-200 is Mark Q-20.
He further deposed that then he took the documents and articles seized from
the house of Ranjan Dwivedi to the CBI Office where Ranjan CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 735 Dwivedi was also taken and produced before Dy. SP Sardari Lal,
Chief IO. He handed over the documents and Seizure Memo to Dy. SP Sardari Lal.
(Juxtapose Ex.PW-43/AA194 to Ex.PW-43/AA-
200 are available in Folder R-119.)
652\. The prosecution has also examined the search witness namely PW-115 Sh.
Laxmi Narain Vishnu Dutt Kumar, who deposed that in July 1975, he was residing
on the first floor of the property No.31, National Park, Lajpat Nagar, New
Delhi. He knew accused Ranjan Dwivedi, who was residing on the second floor of
the said house. (On the day of deposition of PW-115 accused Ranjan Dwivedi was
to appear in the court but he did not appear and his counsel submitted that
the identity of Ranjan Dwivedi is not disputed). PW-115 deposed that he can
identify aforesaid Ranjan Dwivedi. He deposed that one foreign lady used to
reside with Ranjan Dwivedi on the second floor of that house and he did not
know what relationship she had with Ranjan Dwivedi but she claimed to be his
wife and Ranjan Dwivedi also used to tell him that she was his wife. He
further deposed that in the first week of July 1975, Dy. SP Puri came along
with one Mr. Narula and he was asked by Dy. SP Puri to join him. He joined Dy.
SP Puri and accompanied him to the said house of Ranjan Dwivedi, where Ranjan
Dwivedi and his wife were found present. Ranjan Dwivedi had with him two
rooms, kitchen and bathroom. Some papers were taken into possession by Mr.
Puri from the drawing-cum-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 736 bedroom of Ranjan Dwivedi. He put his initials on all
the papers taken into possession by Mr. Puri from the house of Ranjan Dwivedi.
He has seen the documents Ex.P-133 to Ex.P-136, Ex.P-133-A and Ex.P-133-B in
the court (which were available in the summoned file of the case No. 9/76 from
Hon'ble High Court) and deposed that all these documents bear his initials and
Photostat copies thereof are Ex.PW-115/A-1 to PW-115/A-6 (Available in Folder
R-7). He testified that he has seen diary Ex.P-127 in the said summoned file,
which bears his initials on all written pages including the page having
writing Q-20. He has also seen Anand Marg diary Ex.P-124 in the summoned file,
which bears his initials on all written pages including the page having
writing Mark Q-15, Q-15-A and Q-15-B. He has also seen pocket-cum-purse diary
Ex.P-123 in the said summoned file and his initials appear on all these pages
including the page having writing Q-13, Q-13-A, Q-14 and Q-14-A. The search
proceedings continued for about 2 or 2½ hours and the search list was prepared
in the house of Ranjan Dwivedi which he (PW-115) signed. The Seizure Memo Mark
B-137 in the summoned file bears his signatures at point 'A' and the copy of
this search list was given to Ranjan Dwivedi and the Photostat copy of the
search list is Ex.PW-115/B (Available in Folder R-7). He testified that Dy. SP
Puri took Ranjan Dwivedi with him from the spot. In his cross-examination,
PW-115 replied that Ranjan Dwivedi had written "Received copy" and thereafter
he signed the search list. Ranjan Dwivedi occupied the second floor of the
said CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 737 house in March 1975. They were having family
relationship and on visiting terms with Ranjan Dwivedi. Regarding the
existence of writing Q-20 in the diary Ex.P-127 at the time of the seizure
PW-115 deposed that he had put his initials on this page due to existence of
some writing on it. Documents were collected from different places of the
house of Ranjan Dwivedi. He has denied the suggestion that Ranjan Dwivedi
himself lifted the documents and handed over to Sh. Puri. He also denied the
suggestion that after planting the documents they have been wrongly shown as
recovered from the house of Ranjan Dwivedi. Defence has not derided the
testimony of PW-132 & PW- 115 of arrest of A-3 in RC-11/75 on 06.07.1975.
653\. By giving the suggestion to PW-115 that Ranjan Dwivedi himself handed
over the documents to the CBI Officer at the time of the Search, he has
virtually admitted the seizure of the documents from his house. Further, while
making his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, Ranjan Dwivedi has admitted
that the search was carried out in his said house on 06.07.1975 and documents
were seized and thus the deposition of PW-132, PW-115 further stand
corroborated. While replying question No. 317, he stated that he was arrested
on 06.7.1975 by PW132 Sh. B.R. Puri from his house at 31, National Park, New
Delhi. He also admitted that Sh. Puri carried out search of his said premises
in the presence of witnesses Sh. Vishnu Dutt and Narula after observing

premises and CBI arrived at about 11.00 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 738 AM. While
replying Q. No. 318, he stated that CBI took some of his personal possessions
into custody. He replied question no.319 that the documents, the photocopies
of which are Ex PW-115/A-1 to A-6, were recovered from his residence vide
Seizure Memo Ex PW-115/B. He admitted the CBI made seizure from his residence.
58) Identification of handwriting of A-3.
654\. PW-111 Sh. Surinder Vikram Singh deposed that he had worked as
Accountant & Manager (Administration) from 1965 to June 1982 with M/s. Shabnam
Engineering and Foundry Pvt. Ltd., Jamshedpur. He further testified that he
knew Ranjan Dwivedi, whose real name is Ram Janam Dwivedi, and is an accused
in this case. Ranjan Dwivedi used to be Executive Assistant to the Director
Incharge Smt. Sheela Singh during the period from September 1970 to February
1971. During this period he had seen Ram Janam Dwivedi writing and signing and
for that reason he can identify his handwriting and signatures. Ranjan Dwivedi
had connections with Anand Marg. (The witness has correctly identified the
accused Ranjan Dwivedi in the court). He deposed that Requisition Form for
Reservation Ex.PW-6/A (Available in Folder R-13) is filled up in the hand of
Ranjan Dwivedi and having his signatures and the entire writing is Q-6. From
the summoned file from the Hon'ble High Court brought by Sh. Hari Ram, Diary
Ex.P-124 was shown to the witness and he stated that writing marked Q-15,
Q-15-A, Q-15-B, Q-15-C and Q-15-D are in the handwriting of accused Ranjan
Dwivedi. From the summoned file CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 739 Diary Ex.P-127 was also
shown to the witness and witness stated that the writing Q-20 is in the hand
of accused Ranjan Dwivedi. The Diary Ex.P-123 was also shown to the witness
from the summoned file and witness deposed that writing Q-13, Q-14 and Q-14-A
are in the hands of accused Ranjan Dwivedi.
655\. In his cross-examination by accused Ranjan Dwivedi, PW-111 deposed that
mostly Ranjan Dwivedi signs as "R. Dwivedi". He has denied the suggestion that
on Ex.PW-6/A, the signature are as "R.J. Dwivedi" and witness stated that he
does not find any letter "J" in the signatures on Ex.PW-6/A. He identified the
writing of the Ranjan Dwivedi 11 years after he saw him writing and signing.
He has denied the suggestion that writing Q-20 in the diary Ex.P-127 is not in
the handwriting of Ranjan Dwivedi. (It is pertinent to mention here that in
his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, while giving his explanation in
question No. 323 about his writing Q-20, Ranjan Dwivedi admitted his writing
Q-20 and other diaries). To a question that Ranjan Dwivedi was not even
remotely connected with Anand Marg and PW-111 deposed that he is in fact
follower of Anand Marg.
656\. A scrutiny of deposition of PW-111 reflects that accused Ranjan Dwivedi
has not disputed his employment as Executive Assistant to the Director
Incharge Smt. Sheela Singh in M/s. Shabnam Engineering and Foundry Pvt. Ltd.,
Jamshedpur during the period from September 1970 to February 1971. He has also
not swerved his handwriting at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 740 Point Q-15, Q-15-A, Q-15-B,
Q-15-C and Q-15-D in Diary Ex.P-124 and writing Q-13, Q-14 and Q-14-A in Diary
Ex.P-123. He has only disputed his writing Q-20 in the diary Ex.P-127, which
he admitted in his statement U/s. 313 Cr. PC. He has also not discredited
PW-111 about his capability to identify his handwriting and signatures.
Therefore, from the deposition of PW-111, it is proved that the writing at
Point Q-15, Q-15-A, Q-15-B, Q-15-C and Q-15-D in Diary Ex.P- 124 and writing
Q-13, Q-14 and Q-14-A in Diary Ex.P-123 are in the handwriting of accused
Ranjan Dwivedi. Later, the accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement under
Section 313 Cr. PC has admitted that PW-111 Sh. Surinder Vikram Singh was
acquainted with his handwriting and identified the Requisition Form Ex.PW-6/A,
filled up on his handwriting. It is worthwhile to mention here that PW-132 has
visited the residence of accused Ranjan Dwivedi on 06.07.1975 pursuant to the
instructions of Chief Investigation Officer Deputy SP Sardari Lal of RC No.
11/1975 relating to the case of attack the then Chief Justice of India Hon'ble
Mr. Justice A.N. Ray and the search memo Ex.P-137 in RC No. 11/1975 Photostat
copy of which is Ex.PW-115/B is available on the record, find mentioned the
search proceedings with regard to RC No. 11/1975. All those recovered articles
including three diaries of Ranjan Dwivedi are lying in the file of case No.
11/1975 and as the writing on these diaries mentioned herein before are
relevant to the fact in issue in the present case, the Photostat copy of the
same were placed on record. It has come in the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 741 testimony of
PW-115 that after the search accused Ranjan Dwivedi was taken by PW-132 with
him. PW-132 has also stated that he had taken Ranjan Dwivedi from his house
after the search was over and produced him before Sh. Sardari Lal, Deputy SP,
CBI, who was the Investigation Officer in RC No. 11 of 1975. The accused
Ranjan Dwivedi was never arrested in the present case during the investigation
by the IO and only his custody warrants were issued by the Special Judicial
Magistrate, Patna pursuant to which Ranjan Dwivedi was produced before the
designated court at Patna on 20.12.1976, when he was sent to judicial custody.
657\. The contents of diary of A-3 are very relevant to the facts in issue
regarding his complicity in the crime with other accused and approver Vikram.
While replying Q. No. 319 at page 156, A-3 himself filed certified copies of
entire diaries Ex.Q-13, Q-14 and Q-15 obtained from the record of the Hon'ble
High Court (Available in Part XIX page 3 to 241). He stated that CBI has only
given excerpt of one or two dates of the diary and if the contents and other
passages of diary and other articles seized are read together, this will
substantiate fact that they are only the emotional expression of a young man
struggling in life and profession and experiencing the grace of Almighty at
every step and juncture in life. A-3 also stated that the excerpts of his
writing in diary placed in evidence even if read together with the rest of the
passages of the diary, only proves his innocence and falsify the story of the
prosecution.

668\. The Reservation Slip Ex.PW-6/A has been proved to be in the handwriting
of accused Ranjan Dwivedi by the deposition of PW-111. This has also been
corroborated by the admission of accused Ranjan Dwivedi himself while making
his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC. Recovery of three diaries Ex.P-123,
Ex.P-124 and Ex.P-127 has been proved by PW-115. PW-115 has also proved that
these diaries CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 745 were bearing the writing Mark Q-15,
Q-15-A, Q-15-B, Q-13, Q-13-A, Q-14, Q-14-A and Q-20. PW-111 has also proved
these writings in the handwriting of accused Ranjan Dwivedi as he had seen him
writing and signing while working with him. During his statement under Section
313 Cr. PC, accused Ranjan Dwivedi has himself admitted his diaries, which
contained the above said scribblings, by filing the certified copies of those
diaries from the case of RC No. 11/1975. Still the prosecution has proved that
these writings are in the handwriting of accused Ranjan Dwivedi by taking the
opinion of GEQD, Shimla, who has appeared as PW-43 to prove his report.
669\. By way of abundant caution, prosecution has examined PW-30 Sh. W.R.
Chopra and PW-39 Sh. Rajender Thukral, in whose presence the specimen writing
of A-3 was obtained and the consequent report proved through PW-43 Sh. B. Lal,
GEQD, whose testimonies are consistent with the documentary evidence proved
through PW-111 and PW-115, since A-3 himself having admitted these documents
to be in his handwriting in his statement U/s. 313 Cr. PC, the discussion of
their evidence would be only superfluous on record.
59) Meeting with Baba by Ranjan Dwivedi on 17.12.1974.
670\. As held earlier, it is proved that the recovered diaries from the
residence of Ranjan Dwivedi were bearing his handwriting, which are referred
in succeeding Paras. On 04.01.1975, the accused had written CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 746 in his diary Q-15-D that "Attended D.C. Delhi and narrated my
meeting with Baba on 17th Dec 74." Apparently, before going to Samastipur,
Ranjan Dwivedi met his cult head in Central Jail, Patna on 17.12.1974 and
after Samastipur bomb blast, as per his scribblings in the diary Q-15-D, he
attended Dharam Chakra in Delhi, where he narrated his meeting with Baba on
17.12.1974. In this regard, I proceed to refer the necessary evidence adduced
by the prosecution.
671\. PW-71 Sh. Brinda Ban Pandey deposed that he was posted as Assistant
Jailor Central Jail Patna in December 1974 and Sh. P.K. Ganguli was working as
Superintendant (Jail). He deposed that register Ex.P-150 (D-127) (Available in
Folder R-49) was maintained in due regular course of work in the Central Jail,
Patna, in respect of the visitors to meet the under-trial prisoners in Jail.
This register is for the period 14.5.1974 to 09.1.1975. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi
along with Sh. Ram Tanuk Singh, Advocate submitted an application dated
16.12.1974 addressed to the Superintendant, Central Jail, Patna, seeking
interview with Anand Murtiji, who was lodged there. The same is at Mark
PW-71/A. Sh. P.K. Ganguli, Superintendant (Jail), Central Jail, Patna allowed
interview in the presence of Assistant Jailor vide order dated 16.12.1974,
which is noted on the very application. The order is Ex.PW-71/A. He identified
the handwriting and signature of Sh. P.K. Ganguli on the said order. Before
the interview could take place, another order Ex.PW-71/B was passed on
17.12.1974 by Sh. P.K. Ganguli on the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 747 back of said
application Mark PW-71/A. That register Ex.P-150 contained an entry dated
17.12.1974 (Tuesday) regarding interview by Ram Tanuk Singh and Ram Janam
Dwivedi with Anand Murtiji which is initialed by Chander Nath Mukherjee,
Assistant Jailor, whose writing and signatures and initials were identified by
the witness as he had seen him writing and signing. The relevant entry is
Ex.PW-71/C bearing the initials of Chander Nath Mukherjee at point A. He
further deposed that in November 1975, Sh. Bhageshwari Parshad Pandey was
working as Superintendant, Central Jail, Patna and he had seen him writing and
signing and had also received writing from him in course of his duties and
thus could identify his writing and signatures. Seizure Memo dated 13.11.1975
Mark PW-71/B bears the signatures (Ex.PW-71/D) of Sh. Bhageshwari Parshad
Pandey. Under the Seizure Memo at Mark PW-71/B (Ex.PW-71/D) (also
Ex.PW-151/H), Interview Register was seized by Sh. H. L. Ahuja on 13.11.1975
from Pandey. (Seizure memo is available in Folder R-12). He deposed that
another Seizure Memo (memorandum) Mark PW-71/C dated 28.10.1975 bears
signatures of Sh. Bhageshwari Parshad Pandey at point Ex.PW-71/E. The witness
has also identified the accused Ranjan Dwivedi, present in the court as the
person who met Anand Murtiji on 17.12.1974. During cross-examination of PW-71
on the request of Ld. Defence Counsel, the application of the accused Ranjan
Dwivedi was exhibited as Ex.PW-71/DA. The seizure memos of the register are
Ex.PW-71/D and Ex.PW-71/E (Available in the folder R-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 748
2). As per Register Ex.P-150 at page 169 for 17.12.1974 (Tuesday) the accused
Sh. Ranjan Dwivedi, Advocate, Supreme Court along with Sh. Ram Tanuk Singh,
Advocate, High Court Patna met Sh. P.R. Sarkar @ Anand Murti in Patna Jail.
672\. PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja, Dy. SP, CBI, Investigating Officer deposed (at
page no.3567) that he has seen the Seizure Memo dated 28.10.1975 Mark PW-71/C
(D125) which is in his handwriting and bears his signatures at point 'A' and
Seizure Memo is Ex.PW-151/F (Available in the folder R-2) and vide this
Seizure Memo he has seized original application of Ranjan Dwivedi and Sh. Ram
Tanuk Singh for interview with Anand Murtiji and he has mentioned the details
of the document in the memo. (Original application dated 16.12.1974 of Ranjan
Dwivedi is available in Folder R-2). He deposed (page 3568) that the Seizure
Memo dated 13.11.1975 Ex.PW- 151/H is in his handwriting and vide this Seizure
Memo, he seized one interview Register Ex.P-150 (Document D-127) and it was
signed by Sh. Bhageshwari Parshad Pandey in his presence (Ex.PW-71/D). The
entry Ex.PW-71/C existed in this register Ex.P-150 at the time its seizure.
673\. In his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC, the accused Ranjan Dwivedi
admitted that he met Sh. Anand Murti on 17.12.1974 along with Sh. Ram Tanuk
Singh. The testimony of PW-71 has not been discredited by the accused persons
including Ranjan Dwivedi.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 749 Therefore, there remains no doubt to hold that the
fact of A-3 visiting Jail, having met Anand Murti on 17.12.1974 is established
beyond doubt prior to the bomb blast at Samastipur Railway Station on
02.01.1975.
60) What the diary entries of Ranjan Dwivedi confides?
674\. As dealt earlier, a finding is already returned as regards the presence
of Ranjan Dwivedi having arrived at Samastipur Railway Station along with
Santoshanand and Sudevanand on 01.01.1975 to arrange the Passes/Badges for
entry in to the venue for his co- conspirators, which is proved by
overwhelming corroboratory evidence to support the deposition of approver,
this court is now to understand, decipher and analyze the documentary evidence
just now preceded in the above paragraphs.
675\. The question No. 358 in the statement of accused Ranjan Dwivedi under
Section 313 Cr. PC was confronted to him. The circumstances appeared against
him is that he had written the writing Mark Q-15 in his diary to the effect
that he, Santoshanand and Sudevanand had travelled together from Muzaffarpur
to Samastipur on 01.1.1975. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi explained that by merely
stating that he met S.S. in the bus and S.S. stands for Sectorial Secretary
just as G.S. stands for General Secretary. The accused Ranjan Dwivedi did not
truly explain as to who was that S.S. i.e. Sectorial Secretary if CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 750 he meant that the abbreviation S.S. stands for Sectorial
Secretary. Instead of telling the name of 'SS', he evasively stated that 'SS'
stands for Sectorial Secretary as 'GS' stands for General Secretary. He did
not deny that he met Santoshanand and Sudevanand in the bus. From the
depositions of PW-2, PW-5 and PW-6, it is sufficiently proved by the
prosecution that the accused Ranjan Dwivedi travelled along with accused
persons Sudevanand and Santoshanand by bus from Muzaffarpur to Samastipur.
Thus, accused Ranjan Dwivedi evaded the answer by saying that S.S. stands for
Sectorial Secretary as G.S. stands for General Secretary. The accused Ranjan
Dwivedi has rightly noted in his diary that he met "SS" in the bus, but evaded
to explain the true connotation of these two letters in his statement u/s 313
Cr. PC. Admittedly, the word "Sectorial" is not found in any dictionary even
on the internet. Admittedly, it is also not a coined word. The post of
Sectorial Secretary is also never heard in the common parlance In this context
I may profitably utilize the legal principles embodied in Section 106 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which reads as under:-
> "When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden
> of proving that fact is upon him."
676\. The Section is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. But the Section would
apply to cases where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which
a reasonable inference can be drawn CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 751 regarding the
existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of his special
knowledge regarding such facts, failed to offer any explanation which might
drive the court to draw a different inference.
677\. This provision has come up for interpretation before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in 1956 in Shambhu Nath Mehra Vs. the State of Ajmer AIR 1956 SC 404,
the State of West Bengal vs. Mir Mohammad Omar & Ors. AIR 2000 SC 2988, Sunder
@ Sundararajan vs. State by Inspector of Police AIR 2013 SC 777, Bhimanna vs.
State of Karnataka 2012 (4) JCC 2667 and also recently in Prithipal Singh vs.
State of Punjab and Anr. 2012 Volume I SCC 10 and the relevant Para No.29, in
Prithipal's case reads as under:
> "In State of West Bengal vs. Mir Mohammad Omar & Ors. AIR 2000 SC 2988, this
> court held that if fact is especially in the knowledge of any person, then
> burden of proving that fact is upon him. It is impossible for prosecution to
> prove certain facts particularly within the knowledge of accused. Section
> 106 is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the
> guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. But the Section would apply to
> cases where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which a CBI
> Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 752 reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the
> existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of his
> special knowledge regarding such facts, failed to offer any explanation
> which might drive the Court to draw a different inference. Section 106 of
> the Evidence Act is designed to meet certain exceptional cases, in which, it
> would be impossible for the prosecution to establish certain facts which are
> particularly within the knowledge of the accused."
678\. The above ruling concluded by holding the law that it is obligated upon
the accused who had pleaded such knowledge to prove the same. Here accused
Ranjan Dwivedi submitted that S.S. stood for Sectorial Secretary. He has not
named that person. Neither he has placed any documentary evidence by way of
Constitution of Anand Marg or its bye-laws nor proved the same by naming any
Sectorial Secretary or by producing him in the witness box in his defence. At
least, he could have named the person, who held the post of Sectorial
Secretary to discharge his initial onus as is fixed on him.
679\. The position of law concerning the onus on the part of an accused to
give probable explanation to a circumstance to which he had special
acquaintance or knowledge, which appeared against him from the evidence is
again recognized and the Hon'ble Supreme CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 753 Court laid down
that a false explanation may be counted as providing missing link for
completing the chain of circumstances (See State of Maharashtra Vs. Suresh,
2000 (1) SCC) 471). A false answer/ explanation is again held to be one more
circumstance or a missing link to complete the chain. (Ref. Rohtas Kumar Vs.
State of Haryana, 2013 (14) SCC 434, and also Jagroop Singh Vs. State of
Punjab, 2012 (11) SCC 768).
680\. The Question No. 360 put to the accused Ranjan Dwivedi to confront him
with his handwriting in the Diary, recorded by him on 02.01.1975, while he was
at Samastipur and it reads as under:-
> "It is in evidence against you that you made a note Ex.Q-14A in your diary
> "on 2nd January, 1975 witnessed the Leela of the Lord by becoming utilized
> for the noble purpose", what you have to say?"
> And the accused Ranjan Dwivedi answered that statement made therein as
> ambiguous and cannot read into and furthermore he was not at the scene of
> the incident and therefore could not have witnessed it. He explained that
> this writing is in the diary of 1974 and he has written it as to how he was
> utilized for helping his friend Vinay's mother-
in-law, whose husband had died only a few days earlier, and all were in
distress. Even Vinay had CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 754 not reached by the time, he
coincidently went to their house and they were all overwhelmed by his sympathy
to help their son find employment if he comes to Delhi after mourning
ceremony.
681\. This explanation of the accused Ranjan Dwivedi is to be understood from
the writings he made. According to him the incident was very solemn and
sorrowful because father-in-law (Mr. Sahai) of his close friend Vinay died a
few days earlier and that his relatives were in distress. The accused Ranjan
Dwivedi, if at all intended to quote the said incident in his diary, should
have definitely noted the sorrowful state of the relatives of Vinay pertaining
to his visit on 01.01.1975 only. This writing is concerning the date
02.1.1975, whereas admittedly A-1 visited Sahai's family along with PW-5 and
PW-6 on 01.1.1975. There is not even mention of Vinay either by name or by
coded name as is his practice to refer to the persons by simple alphabets
only. On the other hand, considering the writing and the incident that
happened on 02.1.1975 at Samastipur, where this accused was successful in
procuring/arranging the Passes/Badges for entry into the venue for his co-
conspirators, he vented his thanks- giving by referring it as a supervening
act by a divine element, whom he referred as "Lord". It is very relevant to
note that the conspirators were all impelled and overtaken by the demi-god
status that they had attributed to their Baba, Anand Murti, who was the head
of their cult. Such overwhelming faith of conspirators including Ranjan
Dwivedi in CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 755 their cult and its head Baba Anand Murti who was
treated by them as an incarnation of Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, made them to
refer their cult founder as "Lord" and all the commandments were such of the
design to spread their cult or to refer to "Leela" (play) of their Lord. It is
noteworthy to mention that on 02.1.1975 this accused has made arrangement and
had put himself to the optimum utilization in arranging entry Passes/Badges
for access of accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand to the scheduled event of
inauguration of Broad Gauge line between Samastipur and Muzaffarpur at the
hands of the then Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra. That is how the entire
writing is to be collated to the happenings on 02.1.1975.
682\. If the explanation given by the accused is to be understood in the
backdrop of sorrowful state as explained by him, he would have definitely
mentioned the date of death of father-in-law of his friend Vinay and their
names. Such a thing is not found in his writings but the writings directly
related to his contribution in making arrangements for easy access of co-
conspirators to the scene of crime. Therefore, this explanation is not tenable
and convincing.
683\. In view of the above collation, which are referred to the incident dated
02.01.1975, this accused was referring to his role and no other plausible
explanation is forthcoming. His explanation is only slippery. Accused have not
suggested to PW-1, PW-2, PW-11, PW-13, PW-33 and PW-68 during their cross-
examination that in the hierarchy of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 756 cult there is
post of "Sectorial Secretary" or "SS". In this peculiar situation nothing more
can be deduced from the diary writing than to say that this accused was
successful in getting entry Passes/Badges/Cards arranged for his friends and
they all were referring to their plan to eliminate the target, which they
considered as noble purpose and he considered it as "Leela" of his cult head.
684\. One more writing: -
> "the day was fully utilized as an instrument graciously touched by cosmic
> wave length meeting the sequences. Oh baba, you are the lord of the lords
> prevalent everywhere and will establish your cherished goal of universal
> sudvipra kingdom. Started for Delhi with mother and Bhabi" (Question No.361
> - in respect of the entry in the diary dated 2nd January 1975- Mark Q-15-A).
> Ranjan Dwivedi replied that this entry is not relevant to the incident that
> took place."
685\. The explanation of the accused to the above circumstances appearing
against him in question No. 361, he could not offer any explanation and merely
stated that this entry is not relevant to the incident that took place. This
explanation given by him is highly casuistic and warrants proper deciphering.
As already mentioned above, the cult head i.e. "Baba" Anand Murti was revered
as incarnation of Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna by the cult followers.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 757 After reading the scribbling in the diary, it comes
out that it is more a thanks-giving for engaging some force which helped him
to arrange for the access to co-conspirators to reach the spot of the crime
and therefore this accused had mentioned that his cult head had some divinity.
Attributing his success to have been useful in arranging the Passes, this
accused expressed his beholding to his cult head that because of his
omnipresence, he could make good of this opportunity only by such divine grace
which he refers to as "cosmic wave lengths made the success". It is very
crucial and significant that accused Ranjan Dwivedi referred to the cherished
goal of his cult head in his handwriting by employing the peculiar words only
known to Anand Margies i.e. "Sadvipra raj" (kingdom of moralists). He also
refers after having accomplished such access for his co-conspirators for which
he made a thanks-giving by way of these scribblings, he left for Delhi with
his mother and Bhabhi. In the absence of any other tenable or convincing
explanation and especially in the background of giving an evasive reply, this
accused could not escape himself from his handwriting which clearly refers to
the acts and deeds that had taken place prior to the scheduled event of
inauguration of Broad Gauge line between Samastipur and Muzaffarpur and the
special words employed i.e. "Sadvipra Raj" refers to the objectives of the
Anand Marg.
686\. Next writing confronted to him under Section 313 Cr. PC: -
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 758 "Reached Delhi and received by Rajeshwarji at the
station. News of the first phase of the drama heard at the station"
(Question No.362 referring to the entry in the diary dated 3rd January 1975)
The accused explained that it was in relation with the intended visit of his
future wife and of the consent of his brother Mr. Ram Dwivedi, an Engineer in
America giving his reluctant assent for the same.
687\. Apropos the noting in his writing on the subsequent date, this accused
after reaching Delhi Railway Station specifically refers to the news of 'the
first phase of the drama heard at the station'. As already deciphered above,
the events that had taken place on 02.1.1975, which have been referred by this
accused as a play of their Lord by using the words "Leela", "Cosmic wave
lengths", "Sadvipra Kingdom", etc., here this accused again refers to the
words "drama". "Drama" literally is synonym to the Sanskrit word "Leela" or
"play". This accused must be referring to the news of blast that had taken
place at the spot of crime i.e. Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway Station.
However, strangely this accused gives an explanation that the writing
suggested to his brother Sh. Ram Dwivedi, an Engineer in America, giving his
reluctant acceptance for his proposed marriage with his fiancée. It is
noteworthy that he did not meet his brother Sh. Ram Dwivedi at the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 759 station nor did he receive any telegram or heard anything from
Sh. Ram Dwivedi through anyone, especially when in those days there was no
facility of mobile phones or even STD booths. If this writing is recorded as
related to his brother giving consent for his marriage with his fiancée, he
would have directly referred his brother's consent for marriage.
688\. One more important inculpatory circumstance accosted: -
> "Attended DC (Dharam Chakra), Delhi and narrated my meeting with Baba on
> "17th Dec 74". What you have to say"?
(Question No.364 regarding entry dated 5.1.1975 in his diary Mark Q-15-D) The
accused No. 4 Ranjan Dwivedi explained that the entry of 05/1/75 is of no
relevance and attending DC (Dharam Chakra) which is a public spiritual
function where Margies and their non-Margies friend/relatives attend is not a
venue to discuss conspiracies and as he was admittedly the Advocate for Anand
Marg and had met Shri Anand Murti Ji in Bankipur Jail, the narration of his
meeting with him at a public place cannot be construed as having any sinister
meaning and it is again a case of making a mountain out of mole hill.
689\. The fact that Ranjan Dwivedi met Baba on 17.12.1974 is proved by the
prosecution in the statement of PW-71 Sh. Brindaban Pandey, the then Assistant
Jailor, Central Jail, Patna, who brought the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 760 application
submitted by accused Ranjan Dwivedi to meet Baba and also passed orders on
that application, as found in the Register at Ex.P-150. Furthermore, there is
a clear cut admission in the diary itself that he met Baba on 17.12.1974. It
has also come in evidence that accused Ranjan Dwivedi came by bus to
Samastipur and in this bus, he met other co-devotees of Baba namely accused
Santoshanand and accused Sudevanand. The meeting with co-devotees of Baba by
this accused and his participation in Dharam Chakra (congregation of devotees
of Baba) at Muzaffarpur (AMPS School) and Vahni would go to show that this
accused was under the spell of the founder of the cult namely Anand Murti
(Baba) and it was the design of the entire cult and plan of the co-
conspirators to eliminate anybody who came in their way. Thus, the meeting of
this accused with Baba on 17.12.1974 which he confirmed in his diary and
announcement of such meeting with Baba in the congregation would go to show
that this accused was boastful of himself to have become the useful tool in
the hands of his spiritual/cult head as noted by him elsewhere also in the
diary at Q-15, Q-15D and Q-15A. These writings conclusively establish that
this accused along with the co-conspirators was active in the pursuit of the
cult, which planned to eliminate anybody so as to bring pressure on the
establishment for the release of Baba. However, the explanation given by the
accused Ranjan Dwivedi to these writings that Dharam Chakra is a public
spiritual function where the Margies and their non- Margies friends and
relatives attend is not a venue to discuss CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 761 conspiracy
and that he was an Advocate of the "Sect" is not tangible explanation though
the meeting/congregation of the cult followers and non-followers is a
possibility.
61) Theory propounded by Ranjan Dwivedi under Section 313 of Cr. PC.
690\. In his further explanation to the entire episode, Ranjan Dwivedi stated
that the excerpts of his writing in diary, when read together with the rest of
the passages, only proves his innocence and falsify the story of prosecution.
He stated that he was an advocate for the cult of Sh. Anand Murtiji, and that
the Anand Marg was banned during Emergency. He was going to challenge the
order of the ban imposed against Anand Marg on 26.6.1975 before Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India and this was precisely the reason of his arrest by CBI.
He stated that the strained relations between L.N. Mishra and the then Prime
Minister were mentioned earlier wherein the wife of the deceased expressed her
fear in this regard. He also stated that according to a report in the
Illustrated Weekly dated 18.1.1987, it was mentioned that L.N. Mishra was a
controversial figure and the Bihar Assembly Privileges Sub Committee indicted
Mishra and his family for alleged irregularities in the Kosi Project and he
was accused of showing favours to the Director of the Minerals and Metals
Trading Corporation by the CPM. He also stated that it was alleged by the
opposition that Mishra was the man behind the Tulmohan Ram scandal involving
import licences when he was Minister for Foreign CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 762 Trade
and he had several damning receipts for large sums of money, he had ploughed
into Mrs. Gandhi's Rai Bareli campaign in 1971 which could have seriously
injured her court battle with Raj Narain. He stated that Sh. L.N. Mishra tried
to meet the leader of opposition (J.P. Narain) just before the bare his past
services (sic.) to Mrs. Gandhi to explain how the screws were being tightened
on him and to seek JP's guidance. He stated that the date set for L.N. Mishra
to meet J.P. Narain was mid January but he was killed before he could do so
and many people suspected an assassination for political reasons and the CBI
protected the real offenders and the initial investigation into the
assassination of L.N. Mishra conducted jointly by Bihar CID and CBI unearthed
the plot as hatched by one "Boss Jha" and others wherein Arun Kumar Thakur and
Arun Mishra were paid to kill the Minister and investigation also resulted in
the seizure of blueprints of the map of Samastipur Railway platform and diary
from the house of Arun Kumar Mishra, and that Arun Kumar Thakur was formally
arrested on 08.2.1975 and subsequently made a confessional statement U/s. 164
Cr. PC.
He further stated that on 21.2.1975 Arun Kumar Thakur gave details of his
complicity in the crime and according to Mr. Tarkunde report, A.K. Thakur had
confessed to that which police could not have known at that time such as
complicity of Shiv Narayan Sharma who threw the grenade, witness Shankar saw
Arun Thakur and Arun Mishra running away after the blast and Mr. Bery, a
Railway Officer, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 763 was saluted by Arun Thakur at one of the
platforms before the incident, the diary of A.K. Thakur was attached that
contained highly suggestive entries on 01.1.1975 and 05.5.1975 and
incriminating papers found in the house of A.K. Thakur contained the design of
a grenade, name of the co-accused and a rough sketch of railway lines and
platform and A.K. Thakur stated that he threw away his grenade on the railway
lines and a letter was written by Arun Mishra to Sheo Narayan Sharma dated
10.11.1974 that he was ready "to do the work". He stated that there was a
deliberate suppression of enquiry by Mr. D. Sen of CBI and it was opined that
an officer of the rank of D. Sen could not have suppressed the investigation
into the murder of L.N. Mishra without the assurance of political support from
higher quarters.
Further, he explained that Mrs. Indira Gandhi took unusual interest in this
matter and asked Abdul Gaffoor if he had favoured Jailor Rehman of Samastipur
Jail by promoting him and Mr. Gaffoor denied it. He stated that Mr. Justice
Tarkunde reported attributes that real Visheshwaranand, who was known to the
police as being involved in the conspiracy to murder Madhavanand, was one Hans
Lal s/o Daroga Singh of village Tandura in Bhojpur District. He stated that as
soon as this Srivastava Visheshwaranand (PW-1) made his confessional statement
on 12.5.1975, CBI showered extraordinary favours on him. He stated that
Srivastava was a clerk in PWD Office in Darbhanga and his services had been
terminated in August 1964 due to prolonged absence from duty and on 13.3.1975,
the next day of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 764 making confessional statement, he was
reinstated with continuity in service after 11 years. He stated that according
to Justice Tarkunde, after Mr. S.B. Sahai, DIG Bihar, started a fresh enquiry
into the case at the instance of the then Chief Minister, Vikram was examined
on 30.9.1975 by the Doctor and Jailor of Danapur Sub Jail where he still
remained a prisoner and Vikram told them that the confessional statement was
false and this was result of physical torture. He stated that according to
Justice Tarkunde, Vikram was interviewed by Chief Secretary, Bihar Government,
who met him alone in the cell and later on DIG S.B. Sahai also met him and
they were satisfied that confessional statement of Vikram was due to torture.
691\. Whether the prolixity of this explanation would stand the test of
probabilities to wean away one's attention to the overwhelming evidence
adduced on record or not is the question that arises after going through this
lengthy exp lanation.
This court has already dealt the issue regarding the possibility of PW-1
posing himself as an imposter-Visheshwaranand and further had delved deeply
into the validity and legality of the CID Reports of Bihar Government and the
futility of Tarkunde Report, which is purely hear-say evidence. The main
contention of the accused Ranjan Dwivedi by way of explanation is that late
L.N. Mishra's deeds while in power reeked with corruption in Kosi Project,
MMTC and import licence scandal and was a source for extravagance during the
campaign for Mrs. Gandhi at Rai Bareilly. If the Minister was so CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 765 much tainted his continuance in the Union Cabinet would be un-
understandable and just because he was corrupt, nobody intended to kill him by
taking law into their own hands. There is no material to perceive the
political or personal animosity of the Minister with any of his political
rivals or such foes. The accused has not placed any material to suggest that
the Minister was the object of avowed vengeance at the hands of some private
individuals or the group. In these circumstances, the theory propounded by the
prosecution that the followers of Anand Marg (specifically the accused) had
resolved to get their founder released by extra legal measures through
browbeating, terrorizing the government and in such pursuits the incident
occurred is more probable supported by the cogent, creditworthy and reliable
evidence, when looked through the entire conspectus of ocular and documentary
evidence. This theory further gets credence from the earlier events to the
murder of L.N. Mishra like the self-immolations, attack on one of the
deserters of the cult by the name at Madhavanand at Patna and the tracking the
movements of CM of Bihar by the group, who perceived him to be one more
obstacle for release of their Guru, which are all the offshoots of the
criminal conspiracy and presented with reliable evidence by the prosecution as
discussed above.
62) Extra Judicial Confession by A-1.
692\. PW-11 Sh. Raj Singh deposed that after April 1974, A-1 came to his
residence on 7th or 8 th March 1975, and then on 19.3.1975 CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 766 accompanied by Sudevanand and Vikram at about 08.00/09.00 PM. He
was not previously acquainted with the name of Sudevanand. (The witness has
correctly identified accused Sudevanand and approver Vikram in the Court). He
deposed that the names of Vikram and Sudevanand were disclosed to him during
night by accused Santoshanand. He had earlier seen Vikram as he used to be
present at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi whenever he went there. On
the night of 19.3.1975, accused Sudevanand and approver Vikram were in plain
clothes and they were having one brief case and one bag and some other
luggage. Prior to 19.03.1975, he had seen accused Sudevanand in dress of
Avadhoots. He further deposed that on the night of 19.3.1975 accused
Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Vikram stayed at his house and in his presence
accused Santoshanand told that Baba had become very weak in the jail and they
must make efforts to get him freed from the jail and it was difficult to get
Baba freed by lawful means and for that reason they should adopt such means
which might shake the Government and accused Santoshanand became highly
sentimental and stated that he was prepared to sacrifice his own life to get
Baba freed. He deposed that Sudevanand was also called "Doctorji" as he used
to give homeopathic medicines. After going through morning rituals and taking
their breakfast, Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Vikram left his residence on
20.3.1975 at 8.00 AM. They took with them one Jhola and left the other baggage
at his residence. After attending his office, he returned to his residence at
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 767 about 05.00 PM and within 10-15 minutes of his
reaching house, on 20.3.1975 itself, accused Sudevanand also reached there.
Sudevanand was looking quite nervous. He enquired from him as to whether
Santoshanand and Vikram had also arrived in the house and he told him that
they have not arrived and after about half an hour accused Santoshanand also
reached his house and made enquires about Sudevanand and Vikram. On seeing
each other, accused Sudevanand and Santoshanand embraced each other and kissed
and said Baba has saved them. Vikram did not come to his residence on that
night and on the same evening i.e. 20.3.1975, accused Santoshanand and
Sudevanand lifted all their luggage and started leaving his house. At that
time, they told him to destroy all the articles connected with Anand Marg and
not to tell the police if they come to his residence that nobody had come
there and they also asked him to keep Vikram in his house for the night in
case he reaches there. Thereafter they left towards jungle in different
directions.
693\. PW-11 Raj Singh further testified that on 21.3.1975, he was reading
newspaper, and found the news about hand grenade attack on Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court Sh. A.N. Ray. At that time, Santoshanand also came there and
on his asking he (PW-11) told him that Vikram had not arrived there. He
further deposed that after reading the newspaper report, accused Santoshanand
said, "Sala bach gaya, we had thrown two hand grenades on him." He asked CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 768 Santoshanand as to why they attacked the Chief
Justice and what wrong he had done and Santoshanand replied that he was a
"Mahapapi" (big sinner) and rejected two/three bail applications of the Baba
and that he was the stooge of Indira Gandhi's Government. Santoshanand then
told that, "Behold the leela of the Baba as despite throwing of two hand
grenades, he i.e. Chief Justice did not die." Santoshanand further told him
that perhaps Baba wanted to give a new lease of life to the Chief Justice so
that he could mend his ways. He further told that "see the leela of Baba that
we had thrown only one hand grenade at Samastipur and L.N. Mishra died
although he had superficial injuries as compared to others, who had sustained
grievous injuries but surviving". Santoshanand further told that only that
person dies whom the Baba wants to die and the person whom the Baba does not
want to die, survives even in attack of two hand grenades. He deposed that he
became scared on hearing all this from accused Santoshanand, who informed him
that at that time, they had escaped at both the places i.e. Samastipur and
Delhi by the grace of Baba. He told Santoshanand that he was a family man and
a Government servant and was being involved unnecessarily in such matters and
sought forgiveness and the accused told him not to be a coward and threatened
him with dire consequences of meeting the same fate as that of L.N. Mishra, in
case he divulged information, which he had come to know from them and accused
Santoshanand left his residence and directed him to send Vikram to the Garden
as and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 769 when he comes. On asking of meaning of Garden,
he (accused Santoshanand) told him that Vikram understood it. Santoshanand
again came to his residence on 22.3.1973 at about 8.00 AM and when he was
about to leave for his office at 10 AM, Santoshanand asked him to take him on
scooter as he was to post some letters at GPO, Delhi and being scared of him,
he asked Santoshanand to give him those letters and he gave him 6 or 7 letters
wrapped in one paper and uppermost was addressed to Chief Justice A.N. Ray and
he posted those letters same day at GPO. He stated that accused Santoshanand
gave him Rs.60/- while leaving his house for giving to Vikram as Vikram had no
sufficient funds. On 23.3.1975, Santoshanand again came to his house at 08.00
AM to enquire about Vikram and he told him that he had not reached and
Santoshanand took back those Rs.60/- by saying that Vikram was a bold and
clever man and must have reached all by himself. He also threatened of dire
consequences if he divulges information about them to anyone. On 09.4.1975,
Vikram came to his house at about 07.00/08.00 AM and Vikram told him that he
had already met Santoshanand.
694\. In his cross-examination, PW-11 replied that he knew Vikram prior to his
visiting the house of PW-11. He was introduced to him by Santoshanand. He came
to know about the name of Vikram in the year 1971. He admitted the suggestion
of the defence at Page No. 638 of his deposition, which reads as under:-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 770 "It is correct that while coming to my house along
with Vikram and Sudevanand, Santoshanand was having a bag of black colour."
He did not remember whether Santoshanand was having anything with him when he
visited his house along with Sudevanand and Vikram on 19.03.1975. He denied
the suggestion that on his coming to his house from the office, he was
informed by his wife that the brief case was left there by Santoshanand. He
did not see black bag in the hand of Santoshanand on 20.03.1975, when he
returned to his house. He further deposed that after taking away of that black
bag in the Morning of 20.03.1975 from his house, he did not see that black bag
subsequently. He did not recollect whether during his visit to the house,
Santoshanand used to have a brief case with him in the year 1974\. He deposed
that after 23.03.1975, he had seen Santoshanand only in the court. He further
testified that the details about the incident regarding L.N. Mishra were given
to him by Santoshanand without his specific asking about it and information
given to him was extra judicial confession by Santoshanand. He did not inquire
from him as to who had thrown the hand grenade at Samastipur but Santoshanand
informed that "we had done so". When this information was given to him by
Santoshanand, he told him that he was a family member and immediately they
threatened him. From the word "HUM", he understood that Santoshanand was
referring to himself, Sudevanand and Vikram. He was in plain clothes, when he
came to his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 771 house. He replied that during the night of
19.03.1975, Vikram and Sudevanand were not present, when Santoshanand talked
to him about health of Baba in Jail or that they must take make efforts to get
him freed from the Jail. At that time, Santoshanand also told him that it was
difficult to get Baba released with lawful means and they should adopt such
means, which might shake the Government. He did not agree with the
Santoshanand to get Baba released by illegal means. On 19.03.1975, he did not
have any suspicion that Santoshanand and his two companions were going to do
some illegal act. On 20.03.1975 after coming to his house in the Evening,
Santoshanand embraced Sudevanand, which continued for 5-7 minutes. They did
not give him any threat on that day (20.03.1975). He further answered that on
21.03.1975, when Santoshanand admitted his involvement in throwing of hand
grenade on Chief Justice A.N. Ray, he got very much perplexed but did not ask
him to leave the house. He developed hatred towards Santoshanand after coming
to know his involvement in the matter. Santoshanand narrated him the details
at that time in about 15 or 20 minutes and during this period, he narrated
about the attack on Chief Justice of India and throwing of bomb on L.N.
Mishra. He inquired from him as to whether they had hand in that incident, he
nodded his head in the affirmative and narrated the facts. He further
explained that with regard to L.N. Mishra's case, Santoshanand had narrated
"See the Lilla of Baba that we had thrown only one hand grenade at Samastipur
and L.N. Mishra died although he had CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 772 superficial
injuries as compared to others, who had sustained grievous injuries, but
survived". He did inform the police what Santoshanand disclosed to him and he
has no courage to do so.
695\. In the lengthy cross-examination running into 50 pages of PW- 11 Sh. Raj
Singh spread over several dates, the defence had only got repeated the
examination-in-chief and they could not cause any dent in his testimony. The
defence does not deride visit of accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and approver
Vikram to the house of PW- 11 from 19.03.1975 to 23.03.1975 by giving him
suggestion that "While coming to his house along with Vikram and Sudevanand,
Santoshanand was having a bag of black colour". The defence has also got
elicited on their own that their visit to the house of PW-11 during this
period by again giving him the suggestion that the wife of PW-11 told him that
Santoshanand had left his black bag and that the bag brought by Santoshanand
on 20.03.1975 was not in his hand in the Evening. The defence has further got
admitted their visit on 23.03.1975 as well by giving him suggestion that PW-11
had seen Santoshanand in the court at the time of deposition after 23.03.1975.
696\. The prosecution has examined PW-11 to prove extra judicial confession
made by accused Santoshanand before him that they were responsible for killing
of late Sh. L.N. Mishra in Samastipur bomb blast. The exact words are already
mentioned in the chief, which are CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 773 got confirmed by the
accused in their cross-examination. This extra judicial confession by accused
Santoshanand was never shattered by the accused persons in the cross-
examination of PW-11. This court finds that the testimony of PW-11 has been
consistent and trustworthy without any ornamentation and hence believable.
697\. It would be not out of place to note the findings of the Hon'ble High
Court in Crl. A. 436 and 443 of 1976 DD 14.08.2014, MANU/DE/1873/2014 filed by
accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi (pertaining to the
incident of attack on the then CJI A.N. Ray in RC No. 11/75). The Hon'ble High
Court while dealing with almost identical testimonies of PW-11 and PW-13
herein {PW-57 Raj Singh and PW-55 Shiv Raj Singh, the witnesses examined in
the files of the above said appeals} has given its verdict in the following: -
> "63. In the instant case, the extra judicial confessions made by A-1 are
> free from any suspicion as to their voluntary character and have also a ring
> of truth in it. There is nothing improbable in A-1s making extra judicial
> confessions to these independent witnesses. The witnesses have reproduced

There was a direction of Chief Judicial Magistrate to the Civil Surgeon,
Samastipur for conducting the post mortem on that dead body. Post mortems were
not conducted after 05.00 PM, thus it was not done on 03.1.1975. On 04.1.1975,
at 9.00 AM he conducted the post mortem. The body of Ram Kishore Parshad Singh
Kishore was identified by Constable Doodh Nath Mishra and Constable Roy Kishan

of the heart were empty, lungs, small intestine, large intestine, liver,
spleen and both kidneys were pale. Urinary bladder was empty and stomach
contained liquid substance. He stated that in his opinion cause of death was
due to above said injuries, all the injuries collectively were sufficient to
cause the death in the ordinary course, and these injuries could be caused by
firearm and by splinters of an exploded hand grenade. All the injuries were
ante mortem. The death took place because of shock and hemorrhage leading to
cardiac respiratory failure. His correct Report is Ex.PW-88/A. It was filled
up in his hand and bears his signatures at point "A". He has denied the
suggestion that he prepared Post-Mortem Examination Report at the instance of
local police without actually conducting the post-mortem examination on the
dead body. As per the Post Mortem Report dated 4.1.1975 Ex.PW-88/A, the age of
the deceased Ram Kishore Prasad Singh was about 32 years.
(This report Ex.PW-88/A is available in Folder R-31.)

opinion CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 800 of the doctor (PW-107), these injuries could be
caused by bomb blast and all these injuries were collectively sufficient to
cause death in the ordinary course of nature. He also opined that duration of
these injuries could be half an hour of his examination. He succumbed to his
injuries at 7.45 AM on 3.1.1975. PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha, who conducted post mortem
on the body of Ram Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore, aged 32 years, on 4.1.1975
vide report Ex.PW-88/A found several injuries on his body including injuries
on both feet. In his opinion, such injuries could be caused by firearm and
splinters of an exploded hand grenade and all injuries were collectively
sufficient to cause death in ordinary course. With regard to the victim Ram
Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore, no prosecution witness has orally stated that he
was seen/present at or around the Dais on Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway
Station on 2.1.1975 at about 6.00 PM when the hand grenade thrown, got
exploded. Nevertheless, the documentary evidence Ex.PW-48/A (Ex. P-17)
corroborated with regard to its veracity through the witnesses PW-35 gives the
fair account of his presence at the scene of episode becoming a victim. Hence,
it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased Ram Kishore Prasad
Singh Kishore has suffered injuries in the said bomb blast at Platform No.3
Railway Station, Samastipur on 02.01.1975, and he succumbed to his injuries on
03.01.1975.

person of Sh. B.N. Prasad (PW-28), Sh. Suraj Narain Jha (deceased) and Ajay
Kumar (PW-58) and another MLC on 02.1.1975 in Sadar Hospital, Samastipur could
also be caused by bomb blast.
724\. In his cross-examination PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha answered that these four
persons (Sh. B.N. Prasad, Sh. Suraj Narain Jha, Ajay Kumar and another) were
not admitted in the Hospital since there was no other doctor except him. He
examined them one by one. The doctors were on cease work (strike) demanding
service benefits. He did not prepare any record in respect of their name,
parentage or injuries and came to know about name of these four injured
persons from Superintendent of Police, Samastipur, District Magistrate,
Samastipur and others including relations of the injured. He has given their
names out of memory. He did not remember whether ski gram of the injured was
taken in the Hospital or not. He found the injuries to be of grievous nature
without having with him their skiagram. He verbally prescribed medicines and
treatment for these injured persons and they were given treatment as per his

725\. PW-99 Sh. Ram Chander Mishra deposed that Surya Narain Jha was his foofa
(husband of father's sister), who was the MLC. On 02.1.1975, Sh. Surya Narain
Jha went to Samastipur to attend inaugural function of Railway Line. He
reached Lahariya Sarai at about 09.00 PM or 10.00 PM in an ambulance in an

726\. In his cross-examination PW-99 it is elicited that none from the public
came in the Ambulance at the residence of Sh. Jha, except a doctor and one
compounder. He could not say whether Dr. S.K. Sarkar and Dr. Ansari gave
treatment to Sh. Jha at his residence before the injured was shifted to Dr.
Nawab's Clinic. Sh. Surya Narain Jha was X-rayed in Dr. Nawab's Clinic and the
doctors in that clinic were already busy in the operation of a child. He did
not remember the time at which the operation of Sh. Jha was concluded but it
took about 2/3 hours. He had seen Sh. Jha at about 04.00 AM on 3.1.1975 when
he was brought to the ward. Sh. Jha was not in a position to speak throughout
until his death. It was elicited that a big crowd of 10,000 or 20,000 persons
assembled and demanded that post-mortem be not conducted on the body of Sh.
Jha. He admitted the suggestion of the defence that he was living with Sh. Jha
who had treated him like his child and he had love and affection for him. He
answered that proper treatment was given to Sh. Surya Narain Jha.
727\. PW-97 Dr. S.M. Nawab, Private Practitioner of Janta Clinic, Darbhanga,
aged about 72 years, deposed that he retired as Principal, Darbhanga Medical
College in 1969 and thereafter he has been engaged in private practice at
Darbhanga. He has been running his own clinic at Darbhanga. He treated mainly
surgical cases. He deposed that on 2nd and 3rd January 1975 he was at
Darbhanga and in those days government doctors were on strike. His junior
doctors CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 805 requested him to allow his clinic to be run as
temporary, free Janta Clinic. He was supervising the doctors. On 02.1.1975 in
the Evening, he heard Bomb blast took place at Samastipur. He immediately
invited all the junior doctors of Darbhanga Medical College who were on strike
to cooperate with him and treat the casualties arising out of Samastipur
blast.
728\. Sh. Suraj Narain Jha also came to his Clinic. Sh. Suraj Narain Jha
suffered blast injuries on his chest and was sent to Darbhanga Medical
College. In his cross-examination, he answered that he does not have any
record in respect of Sh. Suraj Narain Jha.
729\. PW-101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagander testified that he passed MBBS from
Bangalore Medical College in January 1973. He was commissioned in September
1973. In 1975, he was Medical Officer posted at Officers Training School, AMC,
Centre, Lucknow. On first January 1975 he was ordered to go to Darbhanga to
aid the Civil Authority for running their Hospital. He was posted to Darbhanga
Medical College & Hospital. As the doctors in the entire State of Bihar were
on strike w.e.f. 1.1.1975 and on that account services of military doctors
were requisitioned. He has seen the Bed Head Ticket No.14 Ex.PW-101/A of Surya
Narain Jha MLC in his handwriting at the encircled portion with red pen and
bears his signatures. (Ex.PW- 101/A is available in Folder R-6). On 02.1.1975
late in night, he was informed that Mr. Surya Narain Jha was being brought to
the Hospital CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 806 in serious condition. Some persons
claiming themselves to be relatives of Sh. Surya Narain Jha met him. A request
was made to him to permit Dr. Sarkar (PW-100) to operate upon Sh. Surya Narain
Jha. He contacted his superior on telephone immediately and with their
approval, he allowed Dr. Sarkar to operate upon Sh. Surya Narain Jha provided
he undertook full responsibility of treatment and after care and the
consequences. Dr. Sarkar took the responsibility. He then admitted the patient
Sh. Surya Narain Jha. Ex.PW-101/A is his correct endorsement regarding
admission of Sh. Jha in the Hospital. Dr. A.I. Lendhay (PW-66) was his
colleague. He saw him writing and signing and can identify his writing and
signatures. Ex.PW-66/A (Available in Folder R-6) is in hand of Dr. A.I.
Lendhay (PW-66).
In his lengthy cross-examination, the defence suggested to the witness that
there was complete chaos at Darbhanga, Samastipur and in whole of the State of
Bihar with regard to the medical treatment because of strike by the doctors.
It was further suggested by the Ld. Defence Counsel in his cross-examination
that there was loss of blood of Surya Narain Jha on account of lack of medical
facility.
730\. PW-100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar deposed that in the year 1975 he was working as
Senior Lecturer in the Department of Surgery at Darbhanga Medical College and
Hospital. He along with other doctors was on strike at the time of bomb blast
at Samastipur. Military doctors were running the Hospital of Darbhanga Medical
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 807 College during that period of strike by the doctors.
He has seen the Bed Head Ticket No. 132 dated 02.1.1975 in respect of Sh.
Surya Narain Jha MLC Ex.PW-100/A (Available in Folder R-6) and the portion
encircled with red pencil on this Bed Head Ticket was correctly recorded by
him and bears his signatures at point "A". Sh. Surya Narain Jha was brought to
his residence in injured condition in an ambulance and he examined him in the
ambulance itself. His residence was just opposite to residence of Sh. Jha. His
general condition was very low. He, finding his very serious condition, called
Dr. S.N. Chaudhary and Dr. Ansari. He was with Sh. Jha thereafter. Dr. S.N.
Chawdhry and Dr. Ansari also examined Sh. Jha. They all three doctors decided
to shift him to Janta Clinic immediately, which was functioning at Dr. Nawab's
Clinic. All the Government doctors were on strike and not attending the
patients in the Hospital for that reason. They were running Janta Clinic. Sh.
Jha was shifted to Janta Clinic but they found that the patient could not be
properly treated there and so he was shifted to Darbhanga Medical College and
Hospital. He operated upon Sh. Surya Narain Jha with the assistance of Dr.
Ansari & Dr. Ganguli. Before shifting Sh. Jha to Darbhanga Medical College, he
obtained permission of his colleagues to treat Sh. Jha in the Medical College.
He operated upon Sh. Surya Narain Jha in his individual capacity and so was
the case with Dr. Ansari and Dr. Ganguli. He can identify the writing and
signatures of Dr. Ansari since he has been working with him and he had seen
him writing and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 808 signing. The writing Ex.PW-100/B-1 to
Ex.PW-100/B-5 encircled with blue pencil on the Bed Head Ticket is in the
handwriting of Dr. Ansari, whereas writing Ex.PW-100/A-1 to Ex.PW-100/A-3
(Available in Folder R-6) encircled with red pencil on this Bed Head Ticket is
in his own handwriting. Before operation, he found following injuries on the
person of Sh. Surya Narain Jha:-
> 1\. One small injury about 1/4" in diameter over the pericardial region;
> 2\. Small opening over the left inter costal space;
> 3\. One penetrating wound/ninth intercostals space on left side;
> 4\. An injury under bandage on right leg; It was a compound fracture of
> tibia;
> 5\. Clinically, an injury was found on the chest thoracic with collection of
> blood;
He noted all these injuries on Bed Head Ticket at Sh. Surya Narain Jha. He
operated upon Sh. Jha with the assistance of Dr. Ansari and Dr. Ganguli. He
operated upon a part of the chest and the whole of the abdomen. During
operation, he noticed perforation injuries in the stomach, which was repaired.
He also noticed perforated injuries transverse colon, which he repaired. There
was also engorment of blood at the root of mesentery. He suspected foreign
body in the mesentery but it could not be detected and the detection was
hazardous. Inside the abdomen, it was full of blood and faecal matter.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 809 He has mentioned all these details in the Bed Head
Ticket of Surya Narain Jha. The splinters of an exploded bomb could cause all
these injuries. Sh. Jha survived for about 36 hours after the operation and
then expired and all these injuries were individually sufficient to cause
death in the ordinary course of nature.
731\. In his cross-examination PW-100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar replied that Sh. Jha was
sinking when he examined him first. He was optimistic about the survival of
Mr. Jha while operating upon him. He admitted that foreign body entering into
human body because of an explosion travel in the body. It all depends on the
site of injury to prevent further flow of blood if patient is immediately
taken for treatment and even by immediate operation. He enquired about the
previous ailment of Surya Narain Jha before he gave treatment. He was his
next-door neighbor and he (Sh. Jha) used to approach him for each ailment. He
was not suffering from diabetes.
732\. PW-123 Dr. A. H. Ansari testified that in January 1975 he was posted as
Chest Surgeon, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Darbhanga. He knew Dr.
Siriraj Hassan and Dr. S.K. Sarkar and they were posted with him in Darbhanga
Medical College and Hospital in the year 1975. All doctors in the service of
Bihar Government were on cease work during the period from 01.1.1975 to
24.1.1975. He himself, Dr. Siriraj Hassan and Dr. S.K. Sarkar were also on
cease work during that period. Army doctors were running this hospital CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 810 during that period. On 02.1.1975 at about 10.30/11.00 PM, he was
present at his residence outside the premises of Darbhanga Medical College and
Hospital. At that time, he was called by his senior colleagues at the
residence of Sh. Jha MLC to examine him. He went to the residence of Sh. Jha
along with Dr. S.N. Chaudhary, the then Head of the Department of Surgery. Dr.
S. K. Sarkar examined Sh. Jha and his condition was very low. They decided
that he should be operated upon at once. He was then shifted to Janta Clinic
in Dr. Nawab's Clinic and then to Darbhanga Medical College from Janta Clinic.
They decided to operate upon Sh. Jha despite their being on cease work. Health
Service Association took this decision on special request made by wife of Sh.
Jha. On the Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW- 100/B-3, writing Ex.PW-100/B-1 and
Ex.PW-100/B-2 (Available in Folder R-6) are in his hand with his signatures.
He made this correct writing. He also identified handwriting and signatures of
Dr. Siriraj Hassan at point "C" on this Bed Head Ticket as he had seen writing
and signing Dr. Siriraj Hassan. Sh. Surya Narain Jha was operated upon by a
team of three doctors i.e. Dr. S.K. Sarkar, Dr. Siriraj Hassan and he himself.
He carried out the operation of putting in inter-coastal chest drainage on the
left side under local anesthesia. Immediately two pints of blood and large
number of air were discharged under water-sealed bottle. The chest tube was
left inside. Instructions were given for post operative management as under: -
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 811 "(i) Gentle suction of the tube in the chest made in
the water seal
(ii) Chest X-ray in the bed"
On completion of the operation, he examined Sh. Surya Narain Jha on 3.1.1975
on a request of attending army doctors. On examination he found that the
patient was in the process of putting in semi-erect position, which apparently
made him feel better but on further examination his general condition was
still poor with a cyanosis persistent. Chest tube was adjusted that drained
the stale blood and air particularly on gentle suction. Some 30 to 40 cc of
dark blood was aspirated. This made the splash disappear but heart sounds
still appeared feeble and distant. The patient died on 4.1.1975. He was
however not present by the side of the patient at the time of his death. A
small metallic foreign body was noticed in the abdomen. In his opinion, that
splinter caused the death of Sh. Jha. The internal damage found in the person
of Sh. Surya Narain Jha was sufficient to cause his death in the ordinary
course of nature. He with his signatures correctly noted writing Ex.PW-100/B-4
and PW-100/B-5 (Available in Folder R-6).
733\. In his cross-examination PW-123 Dr. A.H. Ansari admitted that a person
having bullet injuries or injuries in bomb explosion should be immediately
given treatment and that the operation if found necessary should be performed
immediately. He also admitted that sometimes CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 812 loss of time
could prove fatal. He also admitted that immediate medical aid would prevent
further damage to the body and the delay in taking the treatment has to be
considered with reference to loss of blood. He stated that abdomen of Surya
Narain Jha was also opened. He admitted the suggestion that the metallic body
could not be extracted from the abdomen of Sh. Surya Narain Jha during the
operation. To reply to the question he stated that the primary and foremost
duty of the Surgeon performing the operation is to repair the damage with a
view to save the patient and during the process, he may take out the foreign
body if it can easily be done.
734\. PW-66 Major Dr. A.I. Lendkhy testified that he did his MBBS in the year
1971 from Bombay University and he was commissioned in Army Medical Core in
September 1974. From Training School, Lucknow, he was sent to Medical College,
Darbhanga from 1.1.1975 to 24.1.1975 due to strike by the doctors. He did not
remember who the Medical Superintendent of Darbhanga Medical College was. On
4.1.1975 the nurse on duty in the Hospital called him at 8.00 AM to attend
patient Sh. Surya Narain Jha. He examined and found him dead. He correctly
recorded his observation in the Bed Head Ticket of the patient. On
examination, he made the following observation:-
"Pulse was not recordable, heart sound was absent, pupils were fixed and
dilated."
Based on this observation, he declared the patient dead. He recorded
endorsement Ex.PW-66/A (Available in Folder R-6) in his CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 813
handwriting on the Bed Head Ticket and his signatures are at point "A". Before
writing his endorsement, he had gone through the case sheet. The army doctors
did not treat this patient. However, this is in his knowledge that besides
others, Dr. Ansari (PW-123) and Dr. Sarkar (PW-100) treated the patient.
735\. As per Bed Head Ticket No.14 Ex.PW-100/A the particulars of the patient
Sh. Surya Narain Jha, MLC, Darbhanga, 52 years, with direction to admit the
patient are mentioned in the handwriting of PW- 101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagender on

736\. PW-45 Sh. Ishwar Chander Mishra deposed that Surya Narain Jha MLC was
his foofa who received injuries in the bomb blast at Railway Platform,
Samastipur on 02.1.1975. He was brought to Darbhanga Medical College for

by him. Inquest Report Ex.PW-45/A bears his signatures at point "A". He had
identified the dead body. The details of injuries found on body of Sh. Surya
Narain Jha were mentioned in this Inquest Report. The post mortem on the body
of Surya Narain Jha was not conducted and his dead body was taken to District
Congress Office, Darbhanga. There it was kept for public Darshan. In his
cross-examination, it is not disputed that Surya Narain Jha did not suffer
injuries in the bomb blast at Railway Station, Samastipur on 2.1.1975. Inquest

737\. PW-106 Sh. S.A.A. Razvi, the then Sub-Inspector and Officer Incharge
P.S. Lahariya Sarai, Darbhanga stated that on 04.1.1975 at 9.00 AM he received
information on telephone from Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital,
Darbhanga about death of Surya Narain Jha. On that particular day, Government
doctors were on cease work. Army Doctors were managing the Hospital. He
deputed ASI Kameshwar Prasad Sinha (PW-106A) to go to Darbhanga Medical
College and Hospital for Inquest Proceedings and other formalities. He was to
arrange for guard of honour for the body of Surya Narain Jha. For this reason,
he personally did not go to Hospital for Inquest Proceedings. After arranging,
for guard of honour, he went to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. There
he came to know that the dead body had been taken to Congress Bhawan.
Thereafter he went to Congress Bhawan and found dead body of Surya Narain Jha
wrapped in a Tri-colour Flag. The guard of honour was presented there. ASI
Kameshwar Prasad Sinha (PW-106A) was also present there. He came to know from
ASI Kameshwar Parsad Sinha (PW- 106A) that relations, friends and sympathizers
of Late Surya Narain Jha did not want that the post mortem be conducted.
Superintendent of Police Sh. K.M. Sinha was present in Congress Bhawan. He had
a talk with him on the subject, who discussed it with the then District
Magistrate. The Superintendent of Police asked him to dispense with CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 816 the post mortem examination and accordingly there was no post
mortem examination on the body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha.
738\. In his cross-examination PW-106 Sh. S.A.A. Razvi replied that bomb blast
took place at Samastipur and not at Darbhanga. He knew that a case had also
been registered at Samastipur and not at Darbhanga. He admitted that Inquest
Proceedings in respect of dead body of Surya Narain Jha were taken on account
of unnatural death and that in case of trial, those Inquest Proceedings might
be utilized. Regarding question of Defence Counsel whether feelings of
relations of deceased that post mortem should not be conducted, were conveyed
to Samastipur Police, he stated that ASI Kameshwar Prasad Sinha (PW-106A)
wrote a supplementary case diary mentioning detail happening and were sent to
Investigation Officer, GRP, Samastipur. It was not sent before post mortem
examination on the body of Surya Narain Jha was dispensed with. He did not
consider it improper or wrong since superior authorities discussed the matter
and apparent cause of death was known. He had deputed Sh. Kameshwar Prasad
Sinha (PW-106A) to take Inquest Proceedings since he was working under him.
739\. PW-106A Sh. Kameshwar Parshad Sinha, the then Assistant Sub-Inspector,
P.S. Lahariya Sarai deposed that on 04.1.1975 SI S.A.A Razvi (PW-106) directed
him to go to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital to take Inquest
Proceedings in respect of dead CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 817 body of Sh. Surya Narain
Jha, MLC. He made an entry in the general diary of P.S. Lahariya Sarai at 9.00
AM for going to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. Thereafter he
proceeded to the Hospital. He took Inquest Proceedings in respect of dead body
of Sh. Surya Narain Jha in the presence of S/S Ravinder Nath Jha and Ishwar
Chander Mishra. Inquest Proceedings Ex.PW-45/A were correctly written by him
in his own hand. The dead body of Surya Narain Jha was found on bed no. 132 of
surgical ward. He found bandage in the chest, abdomen, and right side of the
chest, below the right knee and above the left thigh on the body of Sh. Surya
Narain Jha. He had written in Inquest Report the cause of injuries could be
bomb blast. From the Hospital, the dead body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha was taken
to Congress office at Balbadarpur. He accompanied the dead body to Congress
office and after reaching there, SI Razvi (PW-106) met him there. Post mortem
examination on the body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha was not conducted as wife and
other relatives of Sh. Surya Narain Jha objected to the post-mortem
examination. District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police gave permission
and dispensed with the post- mortem examination. On coming back to the Police
Station, he must have made another entry in the General Diary of the Police
Station. Inquest Proceedings Ex.PW-45/A bears his signatures at point "A".
740\. In his cross-examination it is elicited that he had seen injuries of Sh.
Surya Narain Jha on the night intervening 2 nd and 3rd January, 1975\. As soon
as the patients were being brought, they were being CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 818 taken
to Janta Clinic. Four injured persons were sent to Janta Clinic. No other
person except Sh. Surya Narain Jha was sent to the Hospital. DIG Sh. B.N.
Prasad (PW-28) was one of those injured to whom first aid was already given at
Samastipur. There were some bandages on the person of Sh. Surya Narain Jha
when he was brought to the Hospital. Before he was sent to Darbhanga Medical
College and Hospital, he had not removed his bandages to examine his injuries.
During that night, they were busy in arranging for the medicines for DIG B.N.
Prasad (PW-28) and Surya Narain Jha. Before Surya Narain Jha was removed to
the Operation Theater, his bandages had been removed and at that time, he had
seen his injures. He could not remember the time, even approximately when Sh.
Surya Narain Jha was sent to the Hospital. The bandages of Surya Narain Jha
were removed before he was taken to Operation Theater. There was bleeding on
the whole of his body below the neck. Blood was visible all over his body.
There was bleeding from all his injuries. His clothes were smeared with blood.
Besides dhoti he was having a chaddar, which was also stained with blood. H e
did not suggest to SI Razvi (PW-106) or to any other Police Officer that since
it was a case of GRP Samastipur, they may be consulted before taking decision
as to whether the postmortem should be conducted or not. He categorically
answered that post mortem examination on the body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha was
not conducted as his wife, other relatives CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 819 objected it,
and District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police gave permission and
dispensed with the post mortem examination.
741\. The name of victim Sh. Surya Narain Jha is mentioned in the charge as
Suraj Narain Jha. He was present on the Dais at Platform No.3 of Samastipur
Railway Station on 2.1.1975 at the time of bomb blast, which is evident from
the statement of PW-113 Sh. Raj Deo Rai. Immediately he was initially taken to
Sadar Hospital, Samastipur where PW-88 Dr. N. L. Jha who has correctly stated
his name as Surya Narain Jha treated him. He referred the patient to Darbhanga
Medical College and Hospital, Darbhanga. However, he was taken in an ambulance
and was examined by his neighbor Dr. S.K. Sarkar (PW-100). The House of Sh.
Surya Narain Jha is situated just opposite to the house of Dr. S. K. Sarkar,
which has been stated so by PW-99 Sh. Ram Chander Mishra and nephew of Sh.
Surya Narain Jha and PW-100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar himself. The doctors of Darbhanga
Medical College and Hospital were also on strike and as per the statement of
PW-100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar, the patient was taken to Janta Clinic run by PW-97 Dr.
S.M. Nawab who has also mentioned the name of the patient as Suraj Narain Jha.
However, the doctors did not find Janta Clinic congenial for the operation of
the victim and on medical advice of PW-100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar and PW-123 Dr. A.H.
Ansari, the patient was admitted in Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. He
was admitted there only when PW-101 Dr. (Major) A. Nagender, Medical Officer
obtained consent of Dr. Sarkar (PW-100) and Dr. Ansari (PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 820
123) to the effect that they shall operate the patient at their risk. Sh.
Surya Narain Jha was operated upon and his name was rightly mentioned there as
Surya Narain Jha. In view of the evidence of PW- 100 Dr. S.K. Sarkar, PW-123
Dr. A.H. Ansari and PW-101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagender, Sh. Surya Narain Jha
succumbed to his injuries, which he suffered in the bomb blast on the Dais at
Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway Station on 02.1.1975.
742\. No doubt the post mortem was not conducted on the body of Sh. Surya
Narain Jha as his relatives, friends and well-wishers made request apart from
a persistent demand by the big crowd. Under sub- section 3 sub-clause (iv) of
Section 174 of the "Code", it is provided that when there is any doubt
regarding the cause of death or under sub-clause (v) thereof the Police
Officer for any other reason considers it expedient so to do, he shall forward
body with a view to its being examined, to the nearest Civil Surgeon or other
qualified medical man. There is no doubt and dispute that Sh. Surya Narain Jha
suffered injuries in the bomb blast at Samastipur Railway Station on
02.1.1975. It has come in evidence of PW-113 Sh. Raj Deo Rai that Sh. Surya
Narain Jha was sitting on the Dais at Platform No.3 of Railway Station,
Samastipur on 2.1.1975 when hand grenade thrown there got exploded. He was
taken to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur where he was examined by PW-88 Dr. N.L.
Jha and then examined by Dr. S.K. Sarkar (PW-100) and Dr. A.H. Ansari (PW-123)
and they shifted him to Janta Clinic. From there, he was taken to Darbhanga
Medical CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 821 College and Hospital and operated upon. He
succumbed to his injuries on 04.1.1975.
743\. Thus the cause of death was apparent and he suffered grievous injuries
in the bomb blast. Dr. Sarkar and Dr. Ansari have also explained cause of
death. Examination of the body by the Civil Surgeon or other qualified man
could be dispensed with, where there is no doubt regarding cause of death as
elaborated herein before. It has also come in the statement of nephew of
victim Surya Narain Jha, namely PW-99 Sh. Ram Chander Mishra that the family
members of Sh. Jha did not want post mortem should be conducted on the body of
Sh. Jha. A request was made to obtain the dead body without post mortem and
accordingly the dead body was handed over to them without post mortem. It has
also come in his cross-examination that about 10,000 or 20,000 persons got
assembled who did not want post- mortem examination to be conducted on the
body of Sh. Jha. PW- 106A Sh. Kameshwar Prasad Singh, the then Sub-Inspector
PS Lahariya Sarai testified that post mortem on the body of Sh. Surya Narain
Jha was not conducted as wife and other relatives of Sh. Surya Narain Jha
objected to the post mortem examination. It has also come in his statement
that the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police gave permission and
dispensed with the post mortem examination. In his cross-examination also,
defence got it elicited that post mortem on the body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha
was not conducted as it was objected by his wife and relatives and the
District Magistrate CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 822 and Superintendent of Police gave
permission and dispensed with the post mortem.
744\. Thus, there is no force in the argument of Ld. Defence Counsel that the
post mortem examination was necessary to know the cause of death. They have
not disputed that Sh. Surya Narain Jha, MLC has suffered injuries in the bomb
blast. Immediately thereafter, he was taken to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur
where PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha examined him. Since his condition was very serious
and injuries were of grievous nature, he advised that he should be shifted to
Darbhanga Medical College. The patient was brought in an Ambulance to the
residence of Dr. S.K. Sarkar (PW-100) and at that time, his condition was very
low. Dr. S.K. Sarkar (PW-100), Surgeon and deceased Surya Narain Jha, MLC were
immediate neighbours. Dr. Sarkar (PW-
100) called Dr. S.N. Chaudhary and Dr. A.H. Ansari (PW-123). They decided to
shift him to Janta Clinic and there they found that the patient could not be
properly treated and so he was shifted to Darbhanga Medical College and
Hospital where Dr. S.K. Sarkar, Dr. A.H. Ansari and Dr. Ganguli operated upon
him. PW-100 Dr. Sarkar stated that the splinters of an exploded bomb could
cause all the injuries found on the person of Sh. Surya Narain Jha and all
these injuries were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of
nature. During the operation, Dr. Sarkar noticed perforation injuries in the
stomach. He suspected foreign body in the mesentery, which could not be
detected as the detection, was hazardous. Inside the abdomen, CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 823 it was full of blood and faecal matters. In his expert opinion,
the splinters of an exploded bomb could cause these injuries and these
injuries found on his person were individually sufficient to cause death in
ordinary course of nature. Similarly, PW-123 Dr. A.H. Ansari testified that in
his opinion splinters caused death of Sh. Surya Narain Jha and the internal
damage found in the body of Sh. Surya Narain Jha was sufficient to cause death
in the ordinary course of nature. Therefore, in view of this, it is apparent
enough that Sh. Surya Narain Jha has succumbed to the injuries, which he
suffered in the bomb blast at the Dais on Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway
Station on 02.01.1975 at about 6.00 PM.
745\. On 14.9.1983, the prosecution has examined Sh. Suraj Parsad as PW-125.
Thereafter, Dr. M. Mohanti was examined as a prosecution witness on 28.9.1983
but he is again numbered as PW-125 instead of PW-126. Sh. R.P. Sinha was later
on examined as prosecution witness on 15.9.1983 and he is given Serial No. as
PW-126. To correct the clerical/typographical error, Dr. M. Mohanti is
renumbered as PW- 125A instead of PW-125. Necessary correction is done.

PW-26 Sh. Narinder Prasad Issar, PW-53 Sh. P.N. Tiwari, PW-60 Sh. R.N. Rai,
PW-65 Sh. Vishwanath, PW-109 Sh. Mohan CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel

Sh. Raj Deo Rai, CW-3 Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra and CW-4 Sh. Ved Prakash Gupta to
the effect that in the bomb blast on the Dais at Platform No.3, Railway
Station, Samastipur, the then Railway Minister Late Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra
and his younger brother Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra suffered injuries. Both of them
were taken to Saloon of Special Train. There, Dr. P.C. Bhalla, Chief Medical
Officer and Dr. R.K. Sinha (PW-94), Assistant Medical Officer, Railway
Hospital, Samastipur examined them. CW-4 Sh. Ved Prakash Gupta, the then
Additional Private Secretary to Sh. L.N. Mishra stated that at Samastipur, he
remained in the Saloon. When he was in the Saloon, he heard a loud noise, came
out, and found that Sh. L.N. Mishra and Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra were being
brought to Saloon in injured condition. Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra was bleeding
from his legs and Sh. L.N. Mishra was injured but he could not see any mark.
Dr. Bhalla, Railway Doctor, who was present on the Railway Station,
immediately came to the Saloon. He started treating Sh. L.N. Mishra, who was
in the small cabin. The doctor did not tell about seriousness of the injury;
they decided to go to Danapur by the same train. On the way train stopped at
Patna where lot of supporters of Sh. L.N. Mishra got down. Some supporters who
were at Patna got in and son-in-law of Sh. L.N. Mishra met him at Patna. Dr.
Sahi, who was an eminent Surgeon, also came into the Saloon and examined Sh.
L.N. Mishra. There was doctor's strike going on in Patna on that day and they
went to Danapur by Saloon. At Danapur, Sh. L. N. Mishra was removed to CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 825 Military Hospital where military doctors and other doctors
examined and treated him and he was declared dead on 03.1.1975.
747\. In his cross-examination at the hand of Ld. Special P.P., CW-4 Sh. Ved
Prakash Gupta replied that Sh. L.N. Mishra's political work was more
concentrated in Bihar. He has been with Sh. L.N. Mishra since 1965 until his
death. In his cross-examination by the Ld. Defence Counsel, he answered that
he was not told by anyone about any injury or seriousness of Sh. L.N. Mishra.
He admitted that Dr. Bhalla had accompanied Sh. L.N. Mishra from Samastipur to
Danapur. Sh. L.N. Mishra did not complain of any abdominal pain in his
presence and inside the cabin of Saloon only Dr. Bhalla and Sh. L.N. Mishra
were there up to Patna. From Patna, Dr. Sahi and Dr.C.S. Jha (Son-in-law) were
there up to Danapur. He came to know only in Danapur for the first time that
Sh. L.N. Mishra was taken to Defence Colony & that he was serious and required
to be operated upon. He replied that he was not aware if any postmortem on the
body of Sh. L.N. Mishra was conducted or not as after reaching Danapur, son-
in- law of Sh. L. N. Mishra had taken control of the situation. He also came
to know from doctors of Sh. L.N. Mishra that two splinters from the bomb had
speared his body and had gone up to his heart. He came to Delhi only after
funeral of Sh. L.N. Mishra was over at his native place Balwa Bazaar. The
decision to shift Sh. L.N. Mishra was taken by Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra, MLC of
Bihar. He stated that Sh. Ram CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 826 Vilas Jha (MLC) of Bihar
Assembly who had come to the Saloon after the incident remained in the Saloon
up to Danapur.
748\. PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha, the then Assistant Medical Officer at Railway
Hospital, Samastipur deposed that he was specialized in Anesthesia. On
01.1.1975, Dr. P. C. Bhalla was working as Chief Medical Officer and on the
direction of Medical Superintendent, he accompanied Dr. P. C. Bhalla to
Darbhanga on 02.1.1975 by jeep in the Morning. They traveled by Special Train
from Darbhanga to Samastipur. Dr. P. C. Bhalla sat in the Saloon with the
Railway Minister while he was sitting in another compartment. The Special
Train reached Samastipur in the Evening at about 5.00 or 5.15 PM and stopped
at Platform no. 3. The medical equipments, which were carried with them from
Darbhanga to Samastipur, were shifted to first Class compartment of BG Special
Train on Platform No.5. At about 6.00 PM he heard Chief Security Officer
shouting calling for Chief Medical Officer. He informed Chief Security Officer
that Chief Medical Officer was sitting in the compartment in the rear. In the
meantime, a Railway employee came and informed him about the Railway Minister
being injured in a bomb blast. He along with the staff went running to the
Saloon of Railway Minister and CMO was also found running and they both
reached the Saloon of Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra almost simultaneously.
Dr. P.C. Bhalla examined Sh. L.N. Mishra in that Saloon. He also examined the
wounds, which were given dressing. He saw true copy of Injury Chart CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 827 Ex.PW-94/A (available in folder R-14) in respect of Sh. L.N.
Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra on which portion at point "A" is in his
handwriting with his signatures. The original Chart, correct copy of which is
Ex.PW-94/A was prepared by him at Danapur at about 1.00 AM on 03.1.1975.
(Ex.PW-94/A is available in Folder R-14)
749\. On examining Sh. L.N. Mishra he found injuries on his person which were
noted by him in the Chart (Ex.PW-94A). He noted following injuries on Sh. L.N.
Mishra:-
> 1\. Right Inguinal Region.
> a) Two abrasions about 4" x ½"
> b) One punctured wound about 3/4" in diameter below above wound.
> 2\. Lacerated Injury about 1" x 1/2" on right thigh.
> 3\. Lacerated Injury about 2" x1/2" on the left thigh.
> 4\. Multiple small punctured wounds on both legs.
> 5\. Complained of pain abdomen-suspected intra abdominal injury.
750\. He did not note these injuries at the time of examining Sh. L.N. Mishra.
He thought that after reaching the Hospital, the dressing would be changed and
at that time, injuries would be noted. He generally examined Sh. L.N. Mishra.
His pulse was 85 per minute and blood pressure was 150/90 of mercury. He was
nervous. Chest was CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 828 NAD and abdomen was soft. No
rigidity was found. He did not have any talk with the Railway Minister but in
his presence, Dr. P.C. Bhalla, talked to Sh. L.N. Mishra, Railway Minister.
Dr. Bhalla wanted to take Sh. L.N. Mishra to Hospital at Samastipur but Sh.
L.N. Mishra did not agree and wanted to go Darbhanga and gave an order in this
regard. Sh. L.N. Mishra was given one Pathedin injection by the CMO. Sh. L.N.
Mishra was sleeping though in between he was getting up and complaining of
pain in the abdomen. After doing the dressing of Sh. L.N. Mishra, he was asked
to examine Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra, who was in other room of the same
compartment and found following injuries on the person of Dr. Jagan Nath
Mishra: -
> 1\. Lacerated injury about 2" x ¼" on the left leg, 4"
> above the ankle.
> 2\. There was another injury which was already dressed and on that account I
> had not examined that injury. It was in the popliteal region.
> 3\. Multiple small punctured wound on the left leg.
751\. He did the dressing of the injuries of Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra. He
generally examined Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra and made the following observation:-
> Pulse was 80 per minute regular and fair. General condition was good, chest
> and CVS were N.A.D. Abdomen-soft No rigidity.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ

This Special Train reached Danapur Railway Station at about 11.30 PM. After
sustaining of an injury in the abdomen initially, it remained soft but later,
it became rigid. Sh. L.N. Mishra was complaining of pain in the abdomen when
he was dressing his wounds. He and Dr. P.C. Bhalla after discussion had a
suspicion about the injuries in the abdomen of L.N. Mishra but they could not
get any clue of the injury. At about 10.00 PM when they crossed Barauni, Dr.
Bhalla told him after examination of Sh. L.N. Mishra that some rigidity had
appeared in the abdomen and pulse rate has increased. Once rigidity in abdomen
appears, it would not be possible to hear the peristaltic sound. At the
instance of Dr. P.C. Bhalla, he also examined Sh. L.N. Mishra and found
rigidity while peristaltic sound was absent. Then they concluded that some
injuries occurred to intestine but were not sure about the injuries to other
organs. The pulse rate of Sh. L.N. Mishra was 120 when they reached Danapur.
On reaching Danapur Railway Minister, Sh. L.N. Mishra expressed his desire of
going to Railway Hospital, Danapur. Sh. L.N. Mishra was removed to Railway CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 830 Hospital, Danapur in an Ambulance. Dr. R.V.P. Sinha,
Professor of Surgery and others doctors accompanied Sh. L.N. Mishra to Railway
Hospital, Danapur. Dr. P. C. Bhalla and he himself did not accompany Sh. L.N.
Mishra to Railway Hospital, Danapur in that ambulance and Dr. Bhalla went
there by car and he went there on foot.
752\. From Railway Hospital, Danapur he and Dr. P.C. Bhalla came to Railway
Station. While sitting in the Saloon in which Sh. L.N. Mishra travelled, he
prepared the Chart correct copy of which is Mark PW-94/A. His memory was fresh
at the time of preparing the previously mentioned chart. Railway chart was
submitted before the Ajit Nath Medical Expert Committee. This copy Mark
PW-94/A was prepared before sending original chart to Ajit Nath Medical Expert
Committee. He prepared this correct copy of Mark PW-94/A from the original
chart. This document is already proved by the witness and has been exhibited
as Ex.PW-94/A. Ex.PW-94/A is available in Folder R-14.
753\. In his cross-examination PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha replied that he went to
the Saloon of Sh. L.N. Mishra after coming to know about his receiving
injuries and he found Dr. P.C. Bhalla, CMO, Ram Nandan, Dresser, P.V. Kanhaiya
and 1-2 more persons. On the direction of Dr. P.C. Bhalla, he immediately
started examining the wounds and their dressing. He personally did the
dressing of the wounds of Sh. L.N. Mishra. Dr. P.C. Bhalla did not note the
injuries. Dr. Bhalla did not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 831 ask him at that time or in
the train thereafter to note down the injuries. There was no external bleeding
from the abdomen of Sh. L.N. Mishra. At that time, he could not have
visualized about internal bleeding. Even after he completed the dressing of
the wounds of Sh. L.N. Mishra, Dr. P.C. Bhalla did not inform him that he
suspected internal bleeding from the abdomen of the Railway Minister. There
would be definitely a hole in the abdomen when a splinter of hand grenade
enters the abdomen. He has seen punctured wounds in the abdomen of Sh. L.N.
Mishra. On asking whether there would be bleeding outside or inside in case of
a punctured wound in the abdomen on account of entry of a splinter of a bomb
blast, he stated that there would be internal bleeding after sometime. It
would be necessary that there would be external bleeding also, though in the
case of excessive internal bleeding, some blood may come out. If the loss of
blood is lesser than one liter, there would be no sign of this loss in the
pulse rate and blood pressure. It does not make any difference whether the
blood flows out of the body or it flows inside and in both circumstances, it
would be loss of blood. He attended Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra after dressing of
the wounds of Sh. L. N. Mishra. There was a bandage on one wound of Dr. Jagan
Nath Mishra before he examined him. He personally had not seen any other
doctor examining Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra. He took about 5/6 minutes for dressing
the wounds of Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra and 5 minutes for his general examination
after dressing of the wounds. He might have taken 5 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 832
minutes for general examination of Sh. L.N. Mishra and about 15/20 minutes in
dressing of the wounds. Dr. P.C. Bhalla was taking blood pressure of Sh. L.N.
Mishra after every 15 minutes approximately and every time he used to come to
the room, where Sh. L.N. Mishra was lying from the room of Dr. Jagan Nath
Mishra in order to assist Dr. P.C. Bhalla. They did not record blood pressure
of Sh. L.N. Mishra. It did not strike at that time that he should note down
the injuries of Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra. Even until the
train reached Railway Station, Danapur at about 11.30 PM, it did not strike
him that he should note down the injuries of Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan
Nath Mishra. The original noting about the injuries was prepared by him in his
own handwriting and copy thereof is Mark PW-94/A which was exhibited as
Ex.PW-94/A. It was typed on 31.1.1975. In this document Ex.PW-94/A it is
mentioned by PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha under his signatures that the original
injury report and record or blood pressure and pulse and general condition is
lying in his safe custody. He personally did not inform Sh. L.N. Mishra that
in order to give proper treatment to him it was necessary to have X-ray or
that his X-ray was to be taken and thereafter he could go to any place for
treatment. He did not advise Dr. P.C. Bhalla to have such a talk with Sh. L.N.
Mishra or others present in the Saloon. He replied that injury in abdomen may
or may not be dangerous. He personally did not suggest to Sh. L.N. Mishra or
to Dr. P.C. Bhalla that they were to accompany the Railway Minister to Danapur
which journey would CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 833 take a couple of hours and so
they must get X-ray of Sh. L.N. Mishra. Dr. P.C. Bhalla has also not given
such suggestion in his presence and he did not have any discussion in this
regard with Dr. P.C. Bhalla.
754\. To the question when he was conscious of the fact that the rigidity
might appear in the abdomen and peristaltic sound might be absent within a
period of his suspecting the injury in the abdomen and on reaching Danapur
would take about 3 hours, he replied that they thought that within this period
of journey to Danapur, rigidity might not appear and thus there might not be
absence of peristaltic sound. He did not remember about the time gap between
receiving an internal injury in the abdomen and appearance of rigidity. He has
denied the suggestion that he and Dr. P.C. Bhalla did not care for the health
of Sh. L.N. Mishra or were not bothered. He also denied the suggestion that he
and Dr. P.C. Bhalla did not provide proper treatment to Sh. L.N. Mishra or
gave him false assurance or they gave wrong treatment. He also denied the
suggestion that they purposely did not advise taking of X-ray.

for normalizing blood pressure. He was taking Calmpose to reduce mental
tension. He was also taking Pacetrane for checking and controlling the
trembling of body. In heart disease and high blood pressure, there is chance
of sodium retention in the body, which causes swelling of the whole body and
may cause damage to the kidney. To remove sodium salt from the body, Lassix is
used. As per history, Sh. L.N. Mishra was taking Lassix. He was also taking
Amphicillin, which is high power anti-biotic. There was also history of
urinary tract infection. Besides his duties as Anesthetist, he was performing
general duties as Medical Officer. If a patient is brought to him complaining
severe pain in the abdomen with suspected foreign body in the abdomen due to
injury in the bomb blast, he would examine the patient immediately. If surgeon
were available, he would immediately seek the advice of the surgeon and obey
their directions. If the patient who is a victim of entry of any foreign body
in his abdomen, the general condition of that patient is to be assessed by the
doctor first. Necessary investigation and necessitation measures should be
confirmed and as soon as general condition is found to a stage where
anaesthesia and surgery can be done, at that stage operation can be done.

external massage was not effective, and therefore quickly a left thoraco-tomy
was done through fifth inter costal space and internal cardiac massage was
started. Later on, it was difficult to maintain oxygenation without indo-
tracheal tube, traciohtomy was done, oxygenation started. Cardiac massage and
indo-tracheal oxygenation were continued but the ventricles of the heart

Lassix and capsule Amphicillin. He also admitted that there was past history
of urinary tract infection and chest infection. He was also taking Duvadilon
to increase circulatory flow of blood. He answered that in case of a patient
suffering injuries due to bomb blast, the aim of the operation is not to
extract the foreign body but to repair the damage done by the foreign body.
The question as to whether the patient could be operated upon immediately or
not would be decided keeping in view the condition of the patient. If the
general condition of the patient is very weak and the patient is not fit for
anesthesia or general condition is low, they would necessitate the patient for
few hours. He admitted the suggestion of the defence that he has recorded the
duration of the injuries of the patient only after fully examining the
patient. He recorded time of admission and duration of injuries of Sh. L.N.
Mishra at the same time at which the injuries were recorded in the Bed Head
Ticket.

    Sinha had identified the dead body of Sh. L.N. Mishra.              He did not

Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 850 remember the name
of the relation of Sh. L.N. Mishra to whom the dead body was delivered.
771\. PW-59 Sh. Hari Narain Parshad, the then Executive Magistrate at Khagaul,
District Patna testified that Railway Hospital, Danapur was within their
jurisdiction. On 03.1.1975 at 10.00 AM, Inquest Proceedings Ex.PW-59/A about
the body of Sh. L.N. Mishra were prepared by the police in his presence in the
Railway Hospital, Danapur. It bears his signatures at point "A". Mr.
Nasiruddin was another witness of Inquest Proceedings who also signed in his
presence at point "B". Sh. S.N. Ram (PW-87) who signed at point "C" prepared
this Inquest Report.
772\. PW-151 Investigation Officer Sh. H.L. Ahuja deposed that at page no.
3563 that vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW-151/C (D-24), he seized the copies of the
Bed Head Ticket etc. of Sh. L.N. Mishra from Eastern Railway, Danapur.
Mark-151/C-1 to C-8 are the same copies of Bed Head Tickets etc. seized by him
vide Seizure Memo Ex.PW- 151/C.
(Seizure Memo Ex.PW-151/C is available in folder R-6)
773\. The Ld. Defence Counsel vehemently argued that there was acute delay in
providing medical treatment to Sh. L.N. Mishra at the instance of Sh. Ram
Vilas Jha who is known as "Boss Jha". They argued that the medical facilities
were available at Samastipur CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 851 Railway Hospital as also in
the Sadar Hospital, Samastipur but Sh. L.N. Mishra was not taken to either of
these hospitals for his treatment on the direction of his political boss of
Sh. Ram Bilas Jha in Delhi. They have also referred to the statement of PW-94
Dr. R.K. Sinha who stated that Sh. L.N. Mishra has desired to go to Darbhanga
and instead of taking him to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, he was
taken to Danapur and the Late Sh. L.N. Mishra reached there at about 11.30 PM,
which worsened his condition. From Danapur Railway Station, he was shifted to
Railway Hospital, Danapur, which is very small hospital. He was operated upon
only at about 4.00 AM on 3.1.1975 and thus he did not succumb to the injuries
of bomb blast but due to not providing him medical aid at the appropriate time
on direction of Sh. Ram Vilas Jha. The prosecution has intentionally not
examined Dr. P.C. Bhalla and any of the surgeons, who operated upon Sh. L.N.
Mishra. They further argued that there is no investigation by the
investigating agency as to who was the person responsible for this delay in
medical aid, which was purposely withheld so that the Minister could die.
774\. This court cannot be oblivious of the fact that PW-88 Dr. N. L. Jha,
Medical Officer, Sadar Hospital, Samastipur, having deposed in the very cross-
examination by the accused that on 02.1.1975 there was no other doctor
available except the witness at the local Sadar Hospital. The statement of
PW-93 Dr. S.N. Gupta reveals that 23 persons who sustained injuries in the
bomb blast on 02.01.1975 were CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 852 admitted at about 18.15 hrs
on that day. They were brought, examined and admitted in Railway Hospital,
Samastipur. A perusal of Bed Head Tickets of all the 23 patients shows that 11
patients have left the Hospital on the next date i.e. on 03.1.1975 under
request to the Medical Officer. Five patients out of 11 patients have also
mentioned that they are leaving the Hospital at their wish for better
treatment. Four patients have left the Hospital on 04.1.1975 on request, one
patient left the Hospital on 07.1.1975 on request and one patient on 14.1.1975
on request. It gives the only impression to this court that the patients who
were admitted with the bomb blast injuries on 02.1.1975 at 18.15 hours were
not satisfied with the treatment provided there; that is why they have left
the Hospital by making necessary request.
775\. Court witness (CW-4) Sh. V. P. Gupta who has been the Additional Private
Secretary of the Railway Minister, Sh. L.N. Mishra deposed that they have
decided to go to Danapur for his treatment. In his cross-examination, it is
elicited that this decision was taken by Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3). PW-53
Sh. P.N. Tiwari, the then Chief Public Relation Officer, North-Eastern Railway
deposed that Ram Vilas Jha informed him that the Minister would like to go to
Patna and he conveyed it to CW-4 Sh. V.P. Gupta. PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha deposed
that Dr. P.C. Bhalla, CMO wanted to take Sh. L.N. Mishra to Hospital at
Samastipur but Sh. L.N. Mishra wanted to go to Darbhanga. In cross-examination
of PW-101 Major (Dr.) A.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 853 Nagender, MBBS, the then Medical Officer at Darbhanga
Medical College and Hospital, the Defence Counsel have themselves given
suggestion that there was complete chaos at Darbhanga, Samastipur and whole of
Bihar as the doctors were on strike. Further, the defence has given him
another suggestion that there was loss of blood of Surya Narain Jha because of
lack of medical facility also. It has already come in the statement of PW-100
Dr. S.K. Sarkar, PW-123 Dr. A.H. Ansari and PW-101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagender
that there was complete strike by the doctors in the State of Bihar and on
personal request of Dr. Sarkar, the operation of Surya Narain Jha (deceased)
was conducted thereon subject to request and at his own responsibility. It has
come in the statement of PW-66 Major A.I. Lendkhy, MBBS, that the Army Doctors
did not treat this patient. PW-101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagender and PW-66 Major
(Dr.) A.I. Lendkhy were newly appointed MBBS doctors and they were deputed in
the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital from 01.1.1975 due to strike by the
doctors. By giving the suggestion to PW-101 Major (Dr.) A. Nagender by the Ld.
Defence Counsel, they have admitted that there was complete chaos in Darbhanga
and Samastipur with regard to the medical treatment and there was no medical
facility available in Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. At the cost of
repetition, one needs to note that at Samastipur, there were two Hospitals,
i.e. Sadar Hospital and Railway Hospital. In Sadar Hospital, only one doctor
PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha was available. In Railway Hospital, Samastipur, out of 23
patients of bomb CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 854 blast, 17 have left by making request,
mostly next day. Admittedly, Sh. L.N. Mishra, Railway Minister belonged to the
State of Bihar and was the brother of Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra. Dr. Jagan Nath
Mishra, who also suffered injuries in the incident, was accompanying him.
Further, the Special Train carrying Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra
left for Danapur at 08.00 PM i.e. after about two hours of injuries suffered
by Sh. L.N. Mishra and Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra. There were several options
available before them to have treatment at Samastipur, Darbhanga, Patna and
Danapur. By now from evidence, I have dealt with options of Samastipur and
Darbhanga where treatment was not preferred as no proper medical facilities
were available in both Hospitals at Samastipur and Darbhanga. CW-4 Sh. V.P.
Gupta deposed that there was doctor's strike in Patna on that day. The son-
in-law of Railway Minister namely Dr. C.S. Jha and Dr. Sahi, an eminent
Surgeon boarded the Special Train to Danapur. It appears that due to lack of
medical facility in the Samastipur and Darbhanga, both the brothers L.N.
Mishra and Jagan Nath Mishra took a proper decision to go to Danapur. Even if
it is accepted from the statement of PW-53 Sh. P.N. Tiwari that he was
informed by Sh. Ram Bilas Jha that the Minister has desired to go to Patna,
the son-in-law of Railway Minister namely Dr. C.S. Jha along with eminent
Surgeon Dr. S. Sahi has boarded the Special Train carrying Sh. L.N. Mishra
from Patna. It has come in the statement of CW-4 Sh. V.P. Gupta that son-in-
law of Sh. L.N. Mishra took control of the situation, who was a medical CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 855 expert. Had there been any proper medical facility
available in Patna, the Railway Minister Sh. L.N. Mishra would have preferred
Patna. Several doctors were present to treat Sh. L.N. Mishra on his reaching
at Danapur at 11.30 PM on that day. From the statement of PW-118 Dr. S.P.
Sinha, it has come out that Professor (Dr.) R.V.P. Sinha, Professor (Dr.) U.N.
Sahi, Dr. (Maj.) Mohinder Singh and Dr. P.B. Prasad were the part of the team
of surgeons who operated upon Sh. L.N. Mishra and they were assisted by him
and 4 other doctors. Three Anesthetists were present during the operation. Dr.
M.L. Singh, Dr. S.N. Mishra and Dr. R.P. Sinha Surgeons of Patna Medical
College & Hospital also examined Sh. L.N. Mishra. Dr. U.N. Sahi and Dr. P.B.
Prasad (Surgeons) were also of Patna Medical College and Hospital.
Cardiologist Dr. A.K. Thakur of Patna Medical College and Hospital also
examined him. Therefore, every possible, conceivable medical facility was
available at Danapur, Hospital including the supervision, treatment by a team
of experts. Moreover, CW-4 Sh. Ved Prakash Gupta deposed that Sh. L.N. Mishra
did not complain of any abdominal pain during journey. Even, PW-94 Dr. R.K.
Sinha deposed that there was no rigidity felt by Dr. P.C. Bhalla and PW-94 Dr.
R.K. Sinha until 10 PM when they crossed Barauni. At that time, Dr. Bhalla
told PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha about some rigidity that had appeared in the
abdomen. CW-7 Sh. Jawala Pratap Singh Officer Incharge GRP, Chapra, who was on
escort duty with Sh. L.N. Mishra testified that at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 856 that
time the doctors of Bihar were on strike and for that reason Sh. L.N. Mishra
was taken to Railway Hospital, Danapur.
776\. DW-25 Sh. Vijay Kumar Mishra, who is son of Late Sh. L.N. Mishra reached
Danapur at 10.30 PM on 02.01.1975. He met his father at about 01.30 AM while
being L.N. Mishra being taken for X- Ray. His father expressed being well
though he had splinters on the upper side of the thigh. When inquired, he was
informed that his father has desired to be taken to Danapur Hospital.
777\. Before the surgery, Sh. L.N. Mishra was thoroughly investigated with
regard to his blood urea, blood sugar and urine. His X-ray of abdomen in erect
position, X-ray chest, X-ray pelvis and X- ray right thigh were taken and as
per the X-ray report, two radio opaque foreign bodies of different size were
found in his abdomen. Multiple radio opaque foreign bodies on his right foot
and radio opaque in both thighs were found.
778\. Despite their best efforts, and treatment and operation, Sh. L.N. Mishra
succumbed to his injuries at 9.30 AM on 3.1.1975. PW-118 has deposed that the
patient expired due to intra-abdominal injuries and cardio respiratory failure
and these injuries were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of
nature.
779\. The foreign body recovered from the person of Sh. L.N. Mishra during
operation was sealed with the seal of MS, Eastern Railway, CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 857 Danapur in a phial. It was opened in the court and metallic piece
Ex.P- 192 was taken out, PW-118 Dr. S.P. Sinha identified this foreign body
having been recovered from the person of Sh. L.N. Mishra during the operation,
and he confirmed that it was sealed in the phial in his presence.
780\. Ld. Defence Counsel argued that post mortem on the body of Sh. L.N.
Mishra was not conducted to find the cause of his death. It has come in the
statement of PW-87 Inspector Sidh Nath Ram that the relatives of the Railway
Minister and public did not want post mortem and they wanted to take the dead
body to Sadaquat Ashram. At that time District Magistrate, City Superintendent
of Police and Senior Superintendent of Police were present. The District
Magistrate directed to hand over the body of Sh. L.N. Mishra to his relatives
without post mortem and accordingly, dead body of Sh. L.N. Mishra was handed
over to his relatives.
781\. I have already referred that under sub-section 3 sub-clause (iv) of
Section 174 of Cr. PC, 1973, whenever there is any doubt regarding the cause
of death or under sub-clause (v) thereof police officer for any other reason
considers it expedient so to do, he shall forward body with a view to its
being examined, to the nearest Civil Surgeon or other qualified medical man.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 858 Apparently the death was due to injuries on vital
parts of his body by the splinters of bomb; there was no necessity of his
postmortem.
782\. Even from the evidence it is gathered that there was no suggestion in
the cross-examination of PW-94 Dr. R.K. Sinha that treatment was delayed by
him and by Dr. P.C. Bhalla at the instance of Sh. Ram Bilas Jha or by any
person. The cross-examination of PW- 125A Dr. M. Mohanti and PW-118 Dr. S.P.
Sinha also does not shatter their assertion that metallic piece Ex.P-192 was
found and recovered from the body of Sh. L.N. Mishra.
783\. Moreover, in explanation (2) to Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code
which reads as under:-
> "CHAPTER XVI OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY Of Offences Affecting Life
> 299\. Culpable homicide - Whoever causes death by doing an act with the
> intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily
> injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely
> by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 859 Explanation 2.- Where death is caused by bodily
> injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have
> caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful
> treatment the death might have been prevented."
In view of clear explanation (2) to Section 299 of Indian Penal Code, even if
there was some delay in providing medical treatment to Sh. L.N. Mishra (in
this case there being no such intentional delay caused by the medical
experts), the accused persons cannot escape the rigour of law and claim
benefit of doubt.
784\. The defence has examined Sh. Vinay Kumar Mishra as DW-25, who is son of
late Sh. L.N. Mishra. It has come in his testimony that at the time of
incident of Bomb explosion at Samastipur, he was 28 years of age. His father
had gone to inaugurate Broad Gauge Line at Samastipur on 02.01.1975. At that
time, his uncle Sh. Jagan Nath Mishra (CW-3) was also present at the spot.
Since Darbhanga is at a distance of 32 KM from Samastipur, they thought it fit
that he be taken to Darbhanga Hospital. Thereafter, they came to know that he
was being taken to Patna. Subsequently, they came to know that his father was
being brought to Danapur. His brother-in-law and a doctor by profession Sh.
C.S. Jha and late Hemant Jha were also with the witness. At Danapur Railway
Hospital, he met his father, when he was being taken for X-ray, he talked to
his father at about 01.30 AM. His CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 860 father had expressed
being well though he had splinters on the upper left side of the thigh.
When enquired, he was informed that his father had desired to be taken to
Danapur Hospital. His father was conscious till 02.00 AM, when he lastly saw
him before operation. He overheard that his father had passed away at about
06.00 AM on 03.01.1975. It was soon confirmed and it means he died during or
after the Operation.
In his cross-examination, DW-25 answered that he does not know as to why the
train was late at Samastipur for leaving to Danapur. Admittedly, he was not
present at the spot and he could not give any eyewitness account.
785\. A close scrutiny of the testimony of DW-25 Sh. Vinay Kumar Mishra
reflects that he met his father and talked to him at about 01.30 AM, obviously
on 03.01.1975 and his father expressed being well though he had splinters on
the upper right side of his left thigh and then the witness deposed that his
father had desired to be taken to Danapur Hospital, as already deposed that
decision for Danapur was taken by CW-3. The deposition of DW-25 read with the
evidence of PW-118 supported by detailed operation notes Ex.PW-118/A and
Ex.PW-118/C, shows that one foreign metallic body was found free in the
peritoneal cavity at the root of mesentery causing a thorough hole in the
mesentery. Therefore, the testimony of DW-25 is of no help to the accused
persons.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 861
786\. The defence has examined DW-20 Dr. Ashok Kumar Thakur to prove that late
Sh. L.N. Mishra was not suffering from any heart ailment. DW-20 testified that
on request of one of the relatives of late Sh. L.N. Mishra, he conducted ECG
examination of Sh. L.N. Mishra and at that time there were many senior doctors
present in the Operation Theater. He had stated that all those doctors were no
more at the time of the deposition. His statement was recorded before Ajit
Nath Medical Expert Committee on 14.2.1975 and his statement is Ex.DW-20/A.
(This is available in Folder R-37).
In his cross-examination, he admitted that Dr. R.V.P. Sinha was heading the
team of doctors, who were operating upon Late Sh. L.N. Mishra at that time and
he (DW-20) was not its member.
He did not stay in the Operation Theater after recording ECG. A perusal of the
evidence of this witness shows that he does not impute any negligence to any
of the doctors who have attended to or treated or operated upon Late Sh. L.N.
Mishra. He has only referred to examination of ECG conducted on the person of
Sh. L.N. Mishra prior to his operation. In his deposition he has not referred
to his ECG report also. Admittedly, he was not present in the Operation
Theater during the treatment and operation of Late Sh. L.N. Mishra.
787\. Defence wants to adumbrate that death of Sh. L.N. Mishra is due to
medical negligence. In order to substantiate their version, the defence has
heavily relied on the statement of DW-20 Dr. Ashok Kumar Thakur, Ex.DW-20/A
which he reportedly made before Ajit CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 862 Nath Medical
Expert Committee. In view of the above arguments, this court has closely
examined the document Ex.DW-20/A. After going through the said document, this
court does not find any clue to comment on the death of Sh. L.N. Mishra due to
medical negligence. Statement Ex.DW-20/A only reaffirms that DW-20 had
conducted only ECG examination on the person of Sh. L.N. Mishra. Statement
only shows that ECG revealed that Sh. L.N. Mishra had no heart problem. It
further shows that after operation of his abdomen, the blood pressure of Sh.
L.N. Mishra started dropping and he suffered cardiac arrest. This witness
stated that cardiac arrest was a surprise to him. Further close scrutiny of
the operation notes proved by Dr. S.P. Sinha (PW-118) as referred in the
earlier Paras of the judgement, splinters were found in the abdomen of Sh.
L.N. Mishra and one metallic piece was extracted which is Ex.P-192. The
removal of splinters, extraction of metallic piece from the abdomen naturally
leads to loss of blood due to internal injuries in the intestine, veins and
arteries. The injuries also damaged the capillary of the blood circulatory
system, which is common prudence for which no specific medical knowledge is
required. Under these circumstances, the blood pressure naturally comes down
i.e. affects the flow of blood to the heart. Given these circumstances and the
context, it is undesirable as to how a medical doctor (DW-20) finds surprise
to the cause of death. This witness did not elaborate much in his examination
which would CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 863 help the case of the defence. Furthermore,
the opinion is not supported by any scientific medical data or ECG report or
other experts' opinion.
788\. This court cannot also be oblivious to the testimony of PW-93 Dr. S.M.
Gupta who treated Ram Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore whose deposition that the
patient who also suffered injury due to the blast died owing to cardiac
respiratory failure. From this testimony of PW-93, this court draws sustenance
to sail that opinion of other doctors that Late Sh. L.N. Mishra had suffered
cardiac arrest consequent to the bomb blast which led to his death. Likewise
the PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha, Medical Officer, Sadar Hospital, Samastipur who
conducted the post mortem examination on the body of said Ram Kishore Prasad
Singh also opined that the deceased died because of cardiac arrest owing to
the blast. Therefore, the opinion of DW-20, showing surprise can be said to be
motivated to favour the accused persons and has no medical and legal base.
789\. Following is the details of persons, their Bed Head Tickets with
treatment record, date admission and discharge, who initially took treatment
at Samastipur Railway Hospital, but sought discharge on request for better
treatment:-

803\. Prosecution has examined independent public witness Sh. Brij Mohan
Sharma as PW-57. He was present on the Dais at Platform No.3, Railway Station,
Samastipur on 02.01.1975. He (PW-57) was advised by Sh. Ram Bhagat Paswan to

CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 877 The portion 'E' on Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/E is also
in his handwriting. He stated that generally lacerated wounds are caused by
bomb blast. Splinters could cause these injuries. The injuries of Brij Mohan
Sharma (PW-57) were grievous in nature as X-Ray of Brij Mohan Sharma revealed
fracture of right fibula lower end with multiple foreign bodies in the left
knee.
806\. In his cross-examination PW-116 Dr. K.M. Sinha replied that in his
presence no splinter was taken out from the person of the injured examined by
him. Lacerated wound could be caused either by bomb blast or by any other
force. The entry of foreign body found on the person of Brij Mohan Sharma
(PW-57) was radio-opaque metallic. The Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/E of Brij
Mohan Sharma (PW-57) indicates that he was operated upon but he could not read
from the Bed Head Ticket as to who performed the operation. He did not prepare
separate medico-legal certificate in respect of these injured persons. Quite a
number of patients came in the hospital after the incident and their primary
duty was to render medical aid to the injured persons and on that account
duration of injury was not mentioned in the Bed Head Tickets. He was dealing
with the patients for giving treatment and not from the view point of "medico-
legal cases" so he did not mention the duration of their injury even
subsequently. He was aware that the patients referred by him in his
examination-in-chief were of "medico-legal cases" but his primary duty was to
render medical aid to the patients first.

811\. It has been proved from the statement of PW-85 Ram Bhagat Paswan, PW-113
Sh. Raj Deo Rai, PW-93 Dr. S.N. Gupta and PW- 107 Dr. T.D. Nandi that the

Prasad, DIG Darbhanga, who was standing near the Dais on the Platform No.3
Railway Station, Samastipur, and as there was demonstration, he was going to
make a request to the Railway Minister to conclude his speech. By the time,
Sh. B. N. Prasad (PW-
28) approached the Railway Minister and he had concluded his speech. He
(Railway Minister) was facing West side and took a turn. He (PW-28) stood
behind just by the side of the Railway Minister, he must have moved one-step,
and thereafter there was a blast on the Dais. After the Minister had concluded
his speech, persons from public started raising slogans 'Lalit Babu Jindabad'
and some persons CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 881 moved ahead to garland the Railway
Minister. He fell down and had a feeling that someone had attempted with some
firearm. He was happy as he considered that he had saved the Railway Minister
though he received injuries risking his own life. He (PW-28) was taken to
Samastipur Hospital where he became unconscious on the Dais and on regaining
consciousness, he found himself in Samastipur Hospital. He stated that in
those days there was strike in the Medical College, Darbhanga and he was taken
to Nawab clinic, Darbhanga and remained admitted there as Indoor Patient for
about three months. He was operated upon thrice and was flown to America for
further treatment. Almost all of his intestines came out, there were about 50
splinters in his body, and 25 are still in his body. He joined duties about 8
months later.
813\. Soon after the incident the victim Sh. B.N. Prasad, DIG, Darbhanga was
taken to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur, where he was examined by PW-88 Dr. N.L.
Jha, the then Medical Officer, Sadar Hospital, Samastipur. PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha,
the then Medical Officer, Sadar Hospital, Samastipur testified that from

including himself were on cease work (strike). On 2.1.1975, information was
received that some persons came to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur with injuries
received in a bomb blast and on humanitarian ground, he went to Hospital to
attend them. He went to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur on that day at about
6.30/6.45 PM. As far as he recollected, he examined CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 882 four

After giving first aid to B.N. Parshad (PW-28), Surya Narain Jha (deceased)
and Ajay Kumar (PW-58), they advised that they might be shifted to Darbhanga
Medical College. The injuries of MLC whose name he could not recollect were
simple in nature. That MLC was discharged after giving him first aid. Father
of Ajay Kumar was in local police and he (Ajay Kumar) was shifted immediately
from Sadar Hospital, Samastipur. Many relatives of B.N. Prasad (PW-28) and
Surya Narain Jha (deceased) came to Hospital and took them to Medical College
Hospital, Darbhanga same night.

Prasad (PW-28), Sh. Suraj Narain Jha (deceased) and Ajay Kumar (PW-58) and
another MLC on 2.1.1975 in Sadar Hospital, Samastipur could also be caused by
bomb blast.
815\. In his cross-examination PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha answered that these four
persons (Sh. B.N. Prasad, Sh. Suraj Narain Jha, Ajay Kumar and another) were
not admitted in the Hospital since there was no doctor except him. The doctors

He stated that duration of injuries were within 12 hours. He got the patient
x-rayed and saw the skiagram himself. He was his friend. He accompanied him
from Samastipur to Darbhanga, nature of injuries of B.N. Prasad was grievous,
and nature of weapon used was splinters from some explosive substance. Portion

his cross examination, PW-104 Dr. Naveen Prasad Singh stated that in case of
DIG B.N. Prasad (PW-28) splinters were present on his chest but no attempt was
made to take it out. In case of DIG B.N. Prasad (PW-28) he had seen his X-ray
just after 5 minutes it was X-rayed in the X-ray room itself on 3.1.1975. This
has not been mentioned in Ex.PW-

(Shahdara)  Page No. 885 104/A (of Sh. B.N. Prasad) as they were more
concerned about the treatment of the patient.
(Ex.PW-104/A is available in Folder R-14)
817\. PW-97 Dr. S.M. Nawab of Janta Clinic testified that on the same night,
he also attended to Sh. B.N. Prasad, DIG Police (PW-28) who also had suffered
severe injuries. The main serious injuries on the person of Sh. B.N. Prasad

In addition to the aforesaid injuries, he had many other shrapnel wounds.
818\. PW-97 Dr. Nawab further deposed that all the injuries found on the
person of Sh. B.N. Prasad (PW-28) could be caused by the splinters of an
exploded hand grenade. Sh. B.N. Prasad (PW-28) was brought to his clinic in
the early hours of 3.1.1975 and duration of the injuries was within 12 hours.
Injuries found on B.N. Prasad were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to
cause death. He himself operated upon Sh. B. N. Prasad (PW-28) with assistance
of other doctors. He accompanied Sh. B. N. Prasad (PW-28) to USA for CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)

Prasad in India and abroad, he still has a hernia in his abdomen for which he
has to wear a belt corset. All splinters could not be taken out from the
person of Sh. B. N. Prasad.
819\. In his cross examination PW-97 Dr. Nawab replied that he knew DIG B.N.
Prasad (PW-28) earlier as he is brother of one of his students. He (PW-97) was
going to USA to meet his children and Sh. B.N. Prasad expressed his desire to
accompany him for getting help from his sons who were practicing in USA as
Surgeons. DIG B.N. Prasad was operated upon in USA in his presence but the
operation was not successful. As far as he remembered, one or two splinters
were removed from lower extremity of B.N. Prasad (PW-28).
820\. It is thus established from testimony of PW-28 Sh. Brij Nandan Prasad
and PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha, PW-104 Dr. Navin Prasad Singh and PW-97 Dr. S.M. Nawab
that Sh. Brij Nandan Prasad, DIG suffered grievous injuries in the bomb blast

822\. PW-88 Dr. N.L. Jha, the then Medical Officer, Sadar Hospital, Samastipur
deposed that from 1.1.1975 to 25.1.1975, all the doctors in Government service
in Bihar including himself were on cease work (strike). On 2.1.1975,
information was received that some persons came to Sadar Hospital, Samastipur
with injuries received in a bomb blast and on humanitarian grounds, he went to

were simple in nature. That MLC was discharged after giving him first aid.
Father of Ajay Kumar was in local police and he (Ajay Kumar) was shifted
immediately from Sadar Hospital, Samastipur. Many relatives of B.N. Prasad
(PW-28) and Surya Narain Jha (deceased) came to Hospital and took them to
Medical College Hospital, Darbhanga same night.
823\. He stated that the injuries, which he found on the person of Sh. B.N.
Prasad (PW-28), Sh. Suraj Narain Jha (deceased) and Ajay Kumar (PW-58) and
another MLC on 02.1.1975 in Sadar Hospital, Samastipur, could also be caused
by bomb blast.
824\. PW-97 Dr. S.M. Nawab, Private Practitioner of Janta Clinic, Darbhanga,
aged about 72 years, stated that he retired as Principal, Darbhanga Medical
College in 1969 and thereafter he has been engaged in private practice at
Darbhanga. He has been running his own clinic at Darbhanga. He treats mainly
surgical cases. He stated that on 2 nd and 3rd January 1975 he was at
Darbhanga and in those days government doctors were on strike. His junior
doctors requested him to allow his clinic to be run as free Janta Clinic. He
was supervising the doctors. On 2.1.1975 in the Evening, he heard a rumour of
Bomb blast at Samastipur involving Sh. L. N. Mishra and others. He immediately
invited all the junior doctors of Darbhanga Medical College who were on strike
to cooperate with him and treat CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 889 any casualties which may
arrive to his clinic from Samastipur. The Doctors, who were running Janta
Clinic under his supervision though on strike in Darbhanga Medical College,
maintained a Register in respect of the patients treated by them. The
particulars of those patients treated in the Janta Clinic were entered in the
Register Mark PW-97/A. (Available in Folder R-22). He has seen this Register
Mark PW-97/A in which there are entries from 1.1.1975 to 24.1.1975. The first
person to reach Samastipur was named Ajay Kumar (PW-
58), S/o Police Inspector N. P. Sinha, aged 12 years and his condition was
desperate and he was gasping due to loss of blood. He attended this patient.
His condition was so bad that he had to donate his own blood to enable him to
stand the operation, which was performed by him. It was a thoraco-abdominal
with laceration of the left lung diaphragm, left lobe of liver and stomach.
Splinters of exploded hand grenade could cause this injury of Ajay Kumar. The
injury was caused about six hours earlier. He prepared correct operation notes
in respect of Ajay Kumar (PW-58) and signed it. Ex.PW-97/A is the operation
notes of Ajay Kumar (PW-58) in his handwriting which are correct and bears his
signatures. Injuries of Ajay Kumar were very dangerous and sufficient in
ordinary course of events to cause death.
825\. I have perused the Register Mark PW-97/A. This is bound register
containing the details of the patients i.e. the name, address, age, disease,
treatment and remarks with signatures. There are two CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 890
columns one dealing with Sr. No. and other dealing with registration no. No
doubt there are certain overwriting found in first column of Sr. No. However,
there is no error or discrepancy or overwriting in the registration no. and
other columns. The registration numbers are in seriatim number. It is not
necessary that the proprietor of clinic Dr. S.M. Nawab should have written it
in his own handwriting. He testified that this Register was maintained in his
clinic. PW-104 Dr. Naveen Prasad Singh handed over this register to I.O. This
register was maintained in due course in the clinic and this falls within the
definition of "Fact" as defined in S. 3 (1) of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and
also within definition of a "document". As document stand proved and now it is
exhibited as Ex.PW-97/X. This register reflect that at registration no.153,

826\. In his cross examination PW-97 Dr. Nawab answered that many X-rays of
Ajay Kumar were taken subsequently during his stay in is CBI Vs. Santoshanand

age but by his memory, he stated that his age was about 12 years. He stated
that the operation notes Ex.PW-97/A do not bear his signatures but these were
in his handwriting.
827\. PW-104 Dr. Navin Prasad Singh testified that in January 1975 he was
posted at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Darbhanga. He is MBBS, MS.
In January 1975, the government doctors have ceased the work. Darbhanga
Medical College and Hospital was under the management and control of Army
doctors. On humanitarian grounds they were running Janta Clinic at Dr. Nawab's
Clinic. He stated that on the night intervening 2nd and 3rd January, 1975, a
number of patients were brought to Janta Clinic. One Admission Register Mark

69) Victims of Hurt.
(i) Kapil Deo Narain Singh
829\. The prosecution has not examined him as its witness. PW-85 Sh. Ram
Bhagat Paswan and PW-113 Sh. Raj Dev Rai have stated in their respective
statements that he was also one of the persons who were sitting on the Dais at
Platform no.3 of Railway Station, Samastipur at the time of bomb blast. He was
immediately brought in the Railway Hospital, Samastipur where he was examined
PW-93 Dr. S.N. Gupta, the then Assistant Medical Officer, North-Eastern
Railway Hospital, Samastipur. He stated that on 02.01.1975 at about the same
time Sh. Kapil Deo Narain, MLA was admitted in the Railway Hospital,
Samastipur on bed no.6. He has correctly recorded his particulars at point 'A'
on his Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/F. Noting at point 'B' and 'C' on this Bed
Head Ticket are in hands of Dr. K.M. Sinha (PW-116). He left the hospital on
03.01.1975 of his own will for better treatment.
830\. PW-116 Dr. K.M. Sinha further deposed that Bed Head Ticket no. 3590 in
respect of Kapil Deo Narain Singh, MLA, is Ex.PW-93/F. The particulars on this
Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/F at Point 'A' are in the handwriting of Dr. S.N.
Gupta, which he identified. He examined the patient and found following
injuries:-
> 1\. Lacerated wound 2" X 1" into muscle deep on the lateral aspect of right
> thigh at the junction of upper 2/3rd and lower 1/3rd.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 893
> 2\. Two small punctured wounds ¼" X ¼" X 1" deep on the right thigh medial
> aspect.
> 3\. Superficial burn injury over right leg lateral aspect.
> 4\. Lacerated wound 2" X 1" X muscle deep right axilliary region.
He correctly recorded injuries at portion "B" of the said Bed Head Ticket. All
injuries could be caused by splinters of an exploded bomb.
831\. PW-112 Dr. Rohini Raman Ganguli further testified that he has seen Bed
Head Ticket no. 187 dated 3.1.1975 Mark PW-112/B (available in Folder R-14) in
respect of Kapil Deo Narain Singh. He saw this patient firstly on 3.1.1975 in
Janta Clinic and he stitched the infected wounds and removed the stitches. The
wounds were in right axilla, right thigh and leg. He opened the stitches. The
wounds were infected, wounds were drained and packed with antibiotics.
Somebody must have assisted him while treating the injuries of Kapil Deo
Narain Singh. The details of treatment given to Kapil Deo Narain Singh were
written on his Bed Head Ticket on his dictation. In Bed Head Ticket Mark
PW-112/B, operation notes were written at point 'A' in his presence on his
dictation. From what is written at point 'A' on Mark PW-112/B, he cannot say
that injuries of Kapil Deo Narain Singh were serious. In her cross-
examination, she proved Bed Head Ticket Mark PW-112/B by saying that this is
in the handwriting of Dr. K.P. Pandey whose signatures and writing she
identified. So, this CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 894 document is now exhibited as
Ex.PW-112/B. These injuries could be caused by hard blunt substance or by
splinters of an explosive of hand grenade.
(Ex.PW-112/B is available in Folder R-14)
832\. PW-97 Dr. Nawab further testified that on 03.1.1975 in the morning
Kailash Pati Singh, Advocate, Kapil Deo Narain Singh, MLA, Bihar and Ram
Bhagat Paswan, MP (PW-85) were also brought to his clinic with injuries due to
bomb blast. He had an occasion to examine them and they were admitted in his
clinic.
833\. Perusal of the injuries as stated by Dr. K.M. Sinha (PW-116) and
mentioned in the Bed Head Ticket and statement of PW-112 Dr. Rohini Raman
Ganguli, does not show that he has suffered any fracture and grievous
injuries. The injuries appear to be simple one. Hence, the prosecution has
proved that in the said bomb blast, Kapil Deo Narain Singh suffered "hurt".
(ii) Rama Kant Jha
834\. Though the prosecution has not examined this injured as its witness yet
it has come in the evidence of PW-113 Sh. Raj Dev Rai that Sh. Rama Kant Jha
was sitting on the Dais on 02.01.1975 at Platform No.3 of Samastipur Railway
Station. Soon after the blast, he was immediately brought to the Railway

(PW-116) and at point 'E' in the hand of Dr. T.D. Nandi (PW-107). This patient
was discharged on his request on 04.01.1975.
835\. PW-107 Dr. T.D. Nandi further deposed that he had seen Bed Head Ticket
no. 3599 of Rama Kant Jha, who was admitted in the Hospital on the same day
due to bomb explosion injuries. He found the following injuries on his person,
which are as under:-
1\. Small multiple three penetrating injuries left leg and left ankle ¼"
circular each.
The patient was x-rayed and two foreign bodies i.e. splinters were taken out.
However, he suffered no fracture. Splinters were not taken out by him or in
his presence and only splinters were detected. He correctly noted injuries in
his handwriting at point Ex.PW-107/D on Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/N. The
duration of his injuries was half CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 896 an hour before he
examined the patient. The injuries were simple in nature.
836\. In view of the deposition of PW-113 Sh. Raj Deo Rai, Dr. S.N. Gupta
(PW-93) and PW-107 Dr. T.D. Nandi and Bed Head Ticket Ex.PW-93/N, prosecution
has conclusively proved its case that Rama Kant Jha suffered "hurt" in the

(iii) Jayant Banerjee
837\. PW-127 Sh. Jayant Banerjee testified that at the time of blast on the

by the prosecution though it is mentioned in their Bed Head Tickets that they
had suffered injuries in the bomb blast at Samastipur Railway Station on
02.01.1975 and time of their admission is contemporaneous to the time of
incident. It is common prudence that in such an incident, the explosion, which
damages a huge area many people get injured and out of shock and fear of
further grilling by the investigative agencies and further considering their
recuperation or the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 916 special circumstances, which
compel them from moving from place to place in search of their livelihood;
such of the injured from the floating population do not turn up before the
courts nor would be available during the investigation and also trial. The
defence have also not shattered during the cross-examination of PW-93, PW-97,
PW-107 and PW-116 that the injuries of these victims were not suffered by them
in the bomb blast. Keeping in mind of this peculiarity of the case and further
considering the documentary evidence of their medical record consisting of bed
head tickets referring the injuries and the cause with the history of the
patient found therein, I have no hesitation to hold that all of them though
not examined before the court, have suffered injuries/hurt in the incident.
71) Conspiracy continued......
875\. The evidence on record on this subject is traced to the statement of
PW-2. He testified that on the evening of 03.01.1975, he came to know that
L.N. Mishra had died. He stayed in Anand Margi School at Chakia. After about
15 days, accused Sudevanand came to him at Chakia and enquired from him (PW-2)
about the hand grenade, which was given to him (PW-2) and he replied that
while fleeing away from the spot, the hand grenade was dropped from his hand
on the railway track, and the real fact was that he had deliberately thrown it
there but he gave him to understand as if the hand grenade had accidentally
dropped from his hand. Sudevanand told him that he should come to Chautham
after two/three days at the house of Gopalji and he went to CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 917 Chautham accordingly and from there, he went to Tilihar where he
met Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Arteshanand and Gopalji. He testified that
Santoshanand also enquired from him with regard to hand grenade given to him
and he informed him the same. Then Santoshanand emphasized that they should
collect arms to the maximum extent and he (PW-2) should go to Indo-Nepal
border and meet Anand Margies residing at the nearby places.
876\. Thereafter, PW-2 visited Paras Nath, Guard (PW-27) at Narkatiaganj but
could not get any arms from him. He also met Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) at
Village Chamua who also did not give him any arms. PW-2 further deposed that
he met Paras Nath (PW-27) for the third time in February, 1975 and stayed with
him for 2/3 days at Narkatiaganj at his house and told him that money was
required to purchase arms and suggested that there were two ways, one to loot
Government Treasury or secondly to loot affluent and wealthy persons. As far
as he recollected he met Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27) at his house or at the house
of PW-80. After February 1975, he probably met Sh. Paras Nath (PW-27) in the
month of March 1975 and he had talked to him regarding arms and revealed his
real name as 'Vikram'. He again went to meet him at Narkatiaganj in the month
of April 1975 and told him about the incident at Samastipur and killing of Sh.
Lalit Narain Mishra and they i.e. he himself (PW-2), Sudevanand and
Santoshanand were responsible for killing. He also told him that on 20.3.1975,
hand grenades were thrown by them i.e. by PW-2, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 918
Santoshanand and Sudevanand on Chief Justice of India in New Delhi. He further
deposed that in May, 1975 a meeting was held at Tilihar at the place of
Gopalji, which was attended by him, Gopalji, Santoshanand, Arteshanand,
Sudevanand and Tapas Kumar Banerjee. He deposed that Sudevanand informed in
the meeting that the Baba Ji had sent a message from the Jail that Anand
Margies who were left in the organization were brave persons (JO ANANDMARGI
BACH GAYE HAIN WO BAHADUR HAIN) and Baba further desired that Anand Margies
who are left in the organization would have to give their parichay i.e. they
would have to prove that they are Anand Margies in the real sense. He further
deposed that he was arrested on 24.07.1975 along with Sudevanand at Bhagalpur
by the Bihar Police.
877\. In his cross-examination, PW-2 replied that he met Paras Nath (PW-27)
after about 30 or 35 days of Samastipur incident. He did not talk to him about
Samastipur incident in the month of February, but he talked to him about it in
the month of April (1975). He further answered that he met Roop Nath Mishra
(PW-80) in the month of February (1975), but could not remember whether he met
Khub Lal. When he met Paras Nath in April 1975, no other person was present
along with him. Probably, he met Paras Nath on 15th or 20th April 1975\. He
did not talk to Paras Nath about Samastipur incident. He met Santoshanand
after Samastipur incident at Tilihar. He again met him at Tilihar in the month
of March, thereafter meeting used to take CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 919 place sometime at
Rajgir or in New Delhi. He came to Delhi with Sudevanand on 19.03.1975.
878\. PW-27 Paras Nath Singh deposed that Subir had come to him alone in
February, 1975 and he stayed with him for 2-3 days and Subir enquired from him
if he could find out any source for arranging arms & ammunition and he (PW-27)
asked him not to have any talk with him on the subject. Subir again came to
him in March, 1975 and reminded him about the source for arranging arms and
ammunition and he again asked him not to have any talk with him on the subject
and this time also he stayed with him for 2-3 days. Subir again came to him in
April, 1975 lastly and he stayed with him for 2-3 days and informed him that
they are useless persons as they could not do anything for procuring money,
arms & ammunition to bring revolution. Subir informed him that they were
responsible for bomb blast at Samastipur and throwing of hand grenades on
Chief Justice in Delhi and he (PW-27) told him that he should not visit him
and thereafter Subir did not visit him again. He also deposed that information
which Subir gave him in April, 1975 about Samastipur bomb blast was conveyed
by him to Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80). He informed Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) that
Subir was a dangerous man and he will not permit him to stay and also
requested Roop Nath Mishra (PW-80) not to permit Subir to stay with him. He
further testified that on 3rd visit of Subir, on his enquiry he told him that
his other name was Vikram.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 920
879\. It is found in the cross-examination of PW-27 that this witness appeared
as a witness in the case concerning the attack on Chief Justice of India also.
It is further elicited that when Subir told him that they had flung the hand
grenades on CJI and a bomb at Samastipur, this witness did not inquire as to
who were the other companions. He further answered that he refused to assist
Subir in arranging arms and ammunitions. The cross-examination does not go to
discredit the visit of Subir post Samastipur events for collection of arms and
ammunitions.
880\. PW-80 Roop Nath Mishra deposed that Subir came to his house in
February/March 1975. He met him at the house of Paras Nath Singh (PW-27) at
Narkatiaganj. He also testified that since 1958, he knew Ram Aasrey, who was
an old worker of Anand Marg and in Feb.1975, at Chamua Railway halt, Ram
Aasrey called Subir as Vikram and they came to his (PW-80) house and prior to
that he was not knowing that Subir had another name as Vikram.
In his cross-examination, PW-80 answered that he had seen Vikram only three
times. He talked to him on two occasions and third time he met him in
February/March.
881\. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence regarding the visits of PW-2 to
various places post Samastipur event, the evidence of PW-27 and PW-80
establishes that there have been efforts made by PW-2 to pool the resources
for procuring arms and ammunitions in their CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 921 continued
efforts to secure the release of their cult head on behalf of all the accused
at the directions of accused Santoshanand. It also transpires that PW-2 has
made extra judicial confession before PW-27 regarding his participation in the
Samastipur incident.
882\. It is also pertinent to note that thereafter there was an attempt on the
life of the Hon'ble CJI at New Delhi on 20.03.1975 and the accused
Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi were convicted by the CBI Court in
RC No. 11/1975 (SC-09/1986) and an Appeal was preferred on behalf of accused
persons in which the convictions of Santoshanand and Sudevanand were upheld
(MANU/DE/1873/2014).
72) Tape-recorded version of PW-2 by Jailor Danapur - CW-9's version by
Samastipur Jailor
\- legality : relevancy - retracted confession of CW-8.
883\. It is argued by the Ld. Defence Counsel that initially during
investigation Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-8), Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra (CW-9) and
Shiv Shankar @ Vishwakarma were arrested by the prosecution. The background
alleged is that there was a conspiracy hatched at the house of one Raghunath
Pandey at the behest of Sh. Ram Bilas Jha (MLC), a henchman of Sh. Yashpal
Kapoor, in December 1974. Pursuant to this, three hand grenades were brought
by Shiv Shankar Sharma @ Shiv Sharma @ Vishwakarma on 01.01.1975. These three
persons Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur, Arun CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 922 Kumar Mishra and
Shiv Shankar Sharma @ Shiv Sharma @ Vishwakarma were present on the Dais at
Platform No. 3 on 02.01.1975 and after the speech of Sh. L.N. Mishra was over,
Shiv Sharma rolled over the bomb towards the Rostrum, which got exploded. They
have also argued that even Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-
9) had made confessional statement under Section 164 Cr. PC before the
Judicial Magistrate of the incident dated 02.01.1975. The Investigation
Officer had also filed an application before the Judicial Magistrate to record
the confession of Arun Kumar Mishra, but he did not make the statement before
the Magistrate.
884\. The Ld. Defence Counsel has also submitted that subsequently in
Samastipur Jail, the Jailor has recorded the conversation with Arun Kumar
Mishra (CW-9) in a tape, in which he has admitted his involvement in the
crime. It is submitted on behalf of the defence that the Investigation Officer
has not mentioned anything as to why these persons were let off subsequently
without any reason or justification and due to the imposition of emergency
accused persons have been falsely implicated. Based on these arguments, the
Ld. Defence Counsel submits that the accused had shown strong hypothesis and
as such accused persons are entitled to benefit of doubt.
885\. They further argued that the approver Vikram had conversation with the
Jailor Haider Ali in Danapur Jail. The said Jailor has recorded his statement
in a tape on 30.09.1978. They referred the transcriptions CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 923
of the tape, which were filed by officers of the State of Bihar and the same
are Mark-Z and Mark-Z-1. They submitted that the tape was played in the court
and Vikram has admitted his voice therein. It is argued on behalf of the
defence that in his tape-recorded statement, approver PW-2 Vikram has
retracted his earlier statement made by him under Section 164 of the Cr. PC
before the ACMM, Delhi.
886\. Per contra, Ld. Special Public Prosecutor submits that it was the
initial stage of investigation when Arun Kumar Thakur, Arun Kumar Mishra and
some other persons were interrogated and arrested by the police. When
sufficient evidence was found against the accused facing the trial, final
report under Section 173 of the Cr. PC was filed. The Ld. Special PP has also
pointed out that those persons, who were arrested as suspects in the case
including Arun Kumar Thakur, Arun Kumar Mishra and others were later on
discharged by the competent court. He further argued that the order of
discharge was never challenged by the accused persons before the revisional or
appellate court. He further urges that the statement of PW-2 Vikram in this
case is congruent and replica of the statement he made in the case pertaining
to the attack on CJI at Delhi after the Samastipur incident. In the said case,
the statement of Vikram has been held cogent and believable and therefore this
court has to believe the version of PW-2 alone by discarding every hypothesis.
The Ld. Special PP points out that Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur and Sh. Arun Kumar
Mishra have been CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 924 examined as CW-8 and CW-9 respectively, in
their capacity as court witnesses.
887\. To appreciate these rival contentions, it is necessary to refer the
statement of both these persons Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-8) and Sh. Arun
Kumar Mishra (CW-9).
888\. CW-8 Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur deposed that he is not aware anything about
the case relating to murder of Sh. L.N. Mishra. In his cross-examination by
the Ld. Defence Counsel, he answered that he was arrested in this case
probably in the first week of February 1975 from his residence in his village
by the then S.P. Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-
34) himself. Before his arrest, none of the police officials met him.
Initially, he was taken to the residence of S.P, where he was kept for the
whole night. Then he was taken to Inspection Bungalow at Dal Singh Sarai in
District Samastipur. He was kept in handcuffs. He was given beatings. His
family members were inquiring about him day and night. He was 17 or 18 years
of age at that time. He used to be tortured by the police. He did not complain
against the police before the Magistrate for having kept him in custody as he
was under pressure. He was under threat of liquidation of his family by the
police. He informed the Magistrate of the facts, which were tutored to him by
the police. He deposed that Magistrate gave him in custody of I.B for two days
and thereafter he was sent to Bankipur Jail, Patna. He admitted that
proceedings recorded by CJM, Samastipur dated CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 925 21.02.1975
bears his signatures at Point A on all pages and also at point B. His
statement is Ex.CW-8/A. He further deposed that he made the statement as he
used to be beaten and was under threat. He admitted the suggestion of the
defence that his entire statement is false. He deposed that whatever statement
has been recorded in Ex.CW-8/A has been made by him on asking of the police.
He was kept alone in I.B Bungalow for about 15 days and also in the Jail. He
did not know any person by the name of Shankar Sahu. He met Arun Kumar Mishra
for the first time after he (CW-8) was released from Jail. He deposed that his
house was searched after 4 or 5 days of his arrest. He was not in his house at
that time. He has denied the suggestion that he went to the house of Arun
Kumar Mishra (CW-9) on 01.01.1975. He had never seen Shankar Singh Vishwakarma
@ Shiv Shankar. He also does not know any person by the name of Joginder Raut.
He has denied the suggestion that he was arrested by Sh. K.P. Sinha. He has
denied the suggestion that he was standing near the Rostrum, where meeting of
Lalit Narain Mishra took place on the fateful day. He has also denied that
Arun Kumar Mishra was his companion or that he was with him with hand grenade
near the Dais. He also denied the suggestion that his colleague Shiv Shankar
Vishwakarma took out pin from hand grenade as soon as Lalit Narain Mishra
finished his speech and rolled it towards the Rostrum. He also denied the
suggestion that he, Arun Kumar Mishra and Shiv Shankar Sharma had done it on
asking of their Boss Jha. He deposed that he is CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 926 not
aware that "Boss Jha" was known as Ram Bilas Jha. He has heard the name of
Yashpal Kapoor but does not know him.
889\. In his further cross-examination by Ld. Defence Counsel, CW-8 further
answered that he was not aware about the news of visit of L.N. Mishra prior to
the incident. He was in Samastipur, when he came to know of the incident. He
did not go anywhere after the news. He does not know any Harish Chand Rai, Tea
Vendor of Platform No. 2, Samastipur. He admitted the suggestion of the
defence that his family members never came to meet him in the Inspection
Bungalow. He firstly met Sh. Anjali Kumar in Buxar Jail and he informed him
about the torture at the hands of the police. He was not medically examined.
He testified that the statement given by him in this court is correct one and
the statement recorded by the Magistrate was not correct. In his cross-
examination by Ld. Special PP, CW-8 replied that at the time when his
statement was recorded by the Magistrate in his chamber, S.P. Police was also
present.
890\. Record reveals that on 29.05.1975, Arun Kumar Thakur filed an
application before Chief Judicial Magistrate, Samastipur for bail under
Section 167 (2) (a) of Cr. PC and in this application he alleged that he had
been put to undue pressure, threat, coercion, torture and promises and that
his confessional statement is nothing but an outcome of brain of the police.
This application was considered by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Patna on 05.06.1975 and accordingly, his bail CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 927 application
under Section 167 (2) (a) of Cr. PC was allowed and CW- 8 was ordered to be
released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of
the like amount.
Further, on 18.06.1975, an application was filed by Arun Kumar Thakur to
reject his confessional statement being nullity on the ground that before the
alleged confessional statement, he was subjected to torture and tutoring by
the police in their custody. However, vide order of even date, the Ld. CJM
ordered that the legality of the recorded statement might be looked into by
the trial court only and petition may be kept on record.
891\. The record further reveals that an application dated 16.09.1975 was
filed under Section 169 of Cr. PC by Investigation Officer/Deputy SP Sh. H.L.
Ahuja in the court of CJM, Samastipur Ex.PW-151/DGG on 17.10.1975 for
discharge of Arun Kumar Thakur, Arun Kumar Mishra, Sheo Narain Lal Vishwakarma
@ Shiv Sharma, Uma Kant Jha, Joginder Raut, Shiv Nath Rai, Dukhit Rai and
Vinod Kumar on the ground that investigation is at concluding stage and it has
been found that these persons are not involved in the conspiracy or in the
commission of offence. On the said application on 20.11.1975, the court of Ld.
CJM, Samastipur passed an order and accordingly discharged the said accused
persons namely Arun Kumar Mishra, Arun Kumar Thakur, Shiv Narain Lal
Vishwakarma, Uma Kant Jha, Yogender Raut, Dukhat Rai and Shiv Nath Rai from
the case in RC- 1/75.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 928
892\. A perusal of the above said statement of CW-8 Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur
reflects that Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-34) of the State Police arrested him in
Samastipur bomb blast case in February 1975. He made his confession before the
Magistrate. However, he has not owned the statement and retracted the said
statement. He has explained that during his custody and interrogation, he was
tortured and given beatings. He further explained that he was under threat of
liquidation of his family by the police. He made a tutored statement to the
police. Though, he has admitted that the statement Ex.CW-8/A made by him
before the CJM, Samastipur bears his signatures, yet the statement was
recorded before the CJM, Samastipur during the course of investigation under
Chapter XII titled as "Information to the Police and their powers to
investigate". This statement/evidence collected by the prosecution during the
investigation of the case is not "legal evidence". This court can rely upon to
adjudicate only on that statement, which is "legal evidence". This has been
explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vijender etc. Vs. State of Delhi,
1997 (1) Crimes 158 (SC) and relevant Para 25 of the Judgment reads as under:
-
> ".........The result of investigation under Chapter XII of the Criminal
> Procedure Code is a conclusion that an Investigating Officer draws on the
> basis of materials collected during investigation and such conclusion can
> only form CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
> 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 929 the basis of a competent Court to take
> cognizance thereupon under Section 190(1)(b) Cr. PC and to proceed with the
> case for trial, where the materials collected during investigation are to be
> translated into legal evidence. The trial Court is then required to base its
> conclusion solely on the evidence adduced during the trial; and it cannot
> rely on the investigation or the result thereof. Since this is an elementary
> principle of criminal law, we need not delete (sic.) (dilate/debate) on this
> point any further......".
In view of the above discussion, it is to be reiterated that CW-8 was
initially arrested as a suspect in this matter. During investigation, he was
released on bail under Section 167 (2) (a) of the Cr. PC. He has alleged that
his statement made before MM is the result of torture and coercion. He has
also filed an application before the Magistrate for cancellation of his
earlier confession.
Subsequently, finding no evidence against him in the crime, IO filed an
application for his discharge under Section 169 of Cr. PC and on 20.11.1975,
this application was allowed by the competent court and CW-8 was accordingly
discharged. The same remained unchallenged and attained finality. Even
otherwise, the confessional statement made by CW-8 is not legal evidence worth
considering for CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 930 adjudication of the case in view of the
judgment of Vijendra's case (supra).
893\. CW-9 Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra deposed that he does not know anything about
Lalit Narain Mishra's case. In his cross-examination by the accused persons,
he replied that he was arrested in Lalit Narain Mishra's case from his
residence by S.P., Samastipur. At that time, he was a student. Initially he
was taken to the office of S.P., then to his residence where he was kept for
two days and thereafter he was kept at Dal Singh Sarai i.e. Inspection
Bungalow, where senior Police Officers used to visit him for interrogation. He
was kept alone in fetters. He was never produced before the Magistrate. He
admitted that the application Ex.CW-9/A dated 01.04.1975 appears to be in his
handwriting. He explained that this might have been got written from him while
he was in jail. He also admitted that the application dated 14.04.1975
Ex.CW-9/B is in his handwriting. He was neither willing nor made any statement
before the Magistrate. He has denied the suggestion that he along with Sh.
Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-8) planned to kill Lalit Narain Mishra. He was unable to
recognize Sh. Ram Bilas Jha, MLC of the area. He has denied the suggestion
that he did the job on asking of Sh. Ram Bilas Jha. He further denied the
suggestion that Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-8) and two others were his
accomplices. He further denied the suggestion that he was taken to the house
of one Sh. Raghunath Pandey by Sh. Ram Bilas Jha in December 1974. He further
denied the suggestion that at the house of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 931 Sh.
Raghunath Pandey, a conspiracy was hatched to do this job on asking of Sh. Ram
Bilas Jha. He has denied the suggestion that he gave training to Sh. Arun
Kumar Thakur and Shiv Sharma @ Vishwakarma as to how to handle grenade and how
to take out pin from it. He has also denied the suggestion that he along with
Shiv Sharma and Arun Kumar Thakur planned that Shiv Sharma would roll the
grenade on the Rostrum of the Platform and if the bomb does not explode, Sh.
Arun Kumar Thakur will throw the bomb. He has also denied the suggestion that
as per planning, an Ambassador Car of Raghunath Pandey was kept parked at the
Platform and in case both attempts failed, L.N. Mishra was to be killed at
Narayanpur and Narain Swaroop was the driver of the said car. He has also
denied the suggestion that three hand grenades were brought by Shiv Narain
Sharma @ Shiv Sharma @ Vishwakarma. He also denied the suggestion that on
01.01.1975, he called Sh. Arun Kumar Thakur and Shiv Sharma at his residence.
He further denied the suggestion that he, Arun Kumar Thakur and Shiv Sharma
and one more person reached at the Dais on Platform No. 3 on 02.01.1975 and
after the speech of L.N. Mishra, Shiv Sharma rolled over the bomb towards the
Rostrum, which got exploded.
894\. In his further cross-examination by the Ld. Defence Counsel, CW-9
replied that he never intended to go to make a statement before the
Magistrate, as the statement given to him by Superintendent of Police Sh. Ojha
was containing incorrect facts. He used to be given a CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 932
written statement and was asked to write this statement in his own handwriting
under pressure. Rehman was the Jailor at Samastipur, who used to meet him in
his cell. On a particular date sometime near Holi, he was called by the Jailor
at the gate of the Jail, when he gave him some papers and told him that it was
the statement, which he was to make before the Magistrate and then S.P. was
very much annoyed with him. When he went through the statement, he found all
facts to be false. Before the Jailor talked to him, he offered him breakfast.
He was threatened that if he did not sign the statement, he would be again
remanded. He also asked him to read the statement and return the same to the
Jailor. He has denied the suggestion that by taking the name of God, he was
asked by the Jailor to speak the truth. He was not sure whether the Jailor
recorded his statement on a tape recorder on that day. He has denied the
suggestion that later on he came to know about the search that was carried at
his house. He identified the signature of his grandfather on the Seizure Memo
for the purpose of identification exhibited as Ex.CW-9/E and identified the
notebook Ex.CW-9/C and Ex.CW-9/D. He deposed that he did not remember whether
he was released under the order of a Magistrate or a Judge. He could not
identify the voice of Rehman Jailor as he had met him only once or twice,
however, he could identify his own voice. During his examination, the tape was
played a little bit in respect of the transcription Ex.ZX, which was prepared
by the court of MM. The tape could not be played further on its getting broken
while playing.

895\. During his deposition, the cassette Ex.D-1/C-60 was played in the court.
Before playing the cassette the Ld. Predecessor of this court vide order dated
08.01.1986 sent the same to Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi for preparing
the transcription. The transcription was accordingly prepared by the
Metropolitan Magistrate on 24.01.1986 in the presence of the Ld. Special PP,
accused persons and their respective Defence Counsel. The Metropolitan
Magistrate has prepared the transcription by playing it on a deck.
It is nowhere mentioned as to who identified the voices in the cassette,
however CW-9 Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra was not present before the Metropolitan
Magistrate on 24.01.1986. (The Photostat copy of the transcription Ex.ZX is
available in part XXIV).
896\. The cassette was got repaired from CFSL and was again played in the
court. In his further cross-examination, CW-9 Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra has denied
his voices, which are mentioned in the transcription Ex.ZX at point A to A, B

sure about his voices, which are mentioned in the transcription at points D to
D, J to J, L to L, N to N, P to P and T to T. He admitted his voice at point-F
to F only, where it is mentioned that "Sir Samastipur ke SP vageraha se hum
baat nahi karenge kyonki un logo ne thokha de kar marvaya CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 934
hai aur rassi laga kar sir bhandva diye the". Cassette is Ex.CW-9/X. It is
also exhibited as Ex.D-1/9A and Ex.D-1/A/1. This is available in R-318).
897\. In his further cross-examination by the Ld. Special PP, CW-9 replied
that he was tortured, when he remained in police custody for 15 or 20 days and
given electric shock and put on ice. The police wanted him to confess the
crime and offered him Rs.5,00,000/-, which he refused. He could not identify
the voices in the tape, which were played in the court ascribing to the voice
of Jailor.
898\. Record reveals that CW-9 Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra filed an application
before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Samastipur on 14.04.1975 that he did not
want to make any statement in the case. This application is Ex.CW-9/B. On
15.04.1975, the Ld. CJM, Patna has taken note of the application that since
Arun Kumar Mishra did not want to confess and has declined to make confession.
Record further reveals that on 14.06.1975, Ld. CJM, Samastipur has ordered
release of Sh. Arun Kumar Mishra on bail under Section 167 (2) (a) of Cr. PC.
I have already mentioned herein before that on application of the IO, CW-9 Sh.
Arun Kumar Mishra was also discharged from the case RC-1/75 on 20.11.1975 by
the CJM, Samastipur.

Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 935
899\. It is worth mentioning here that the Jailor Rehman, who has allegedly
recorded the statement of CW-9 in a tape, has not been examined. CW-9 has
denied his voice in the cassette played in the court, except only one
sentence, which is not at all incriminatory. The accused persons have not got
played the cassette in the court during the examination of defence witnesses
to get identified whether the cassette contained voice of CW-9. No officer of
State of Bihar or Samastipur Jail has been examined whether the cassette was
sealed soon after recording the alleged conversation between Jailor and CW- 9
to dispel all doubts of tampering of the cassette. The law on the
admissibility of tape recorded version is well settled. In Ram Singh Vs. Col.
Ram Singh, 1986 AIR (SC) 3, a Bench of Hon'ble three Judges of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India has laid down the following tests for determining the
admissibility of tape recorded version as under: -
> 1\. The voice of the speaker must be identified by the maker of the record
> or other persons recognizing his voice. Where the maker is unable to
> identify the voice, strict proof will be required to determine whether or
> not it was the voice of the alleged speaker.
> 2\. The accuracy of the tape-recorded statement must be proved by the maker
> of the record by satisfactory evidence: direct or circumstantial. 3.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 936 Possibility of tampering with, or erasure of any
> part of, the tape-recorded statement must be totally excluded.
> 4\. The tape-recorded statement must be relevant.
> 5\. The recorded cassette must be sealed and must be kept in safe or
> official custody.
> 6\. The voice of the particular speaker must be clearly audible and must not
> be lost or distorted by other sounds or disturbances.
900\. The ruling of R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra, (1973) 2 SCR 417, by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the essential conditions which, if
fulfilled or satisfied, would make a tape-recorded statement admissible
otherwise not; and observed thus: -
"Tape recorded conversation is admissible provided first the conversation is
relevant to the matters in issue; secondly, there is identification of the
voice; and, thirdly, the accuracy of the tape recorded conversation is proved
by eliminating the possibility of erasing the tape record."
901\. Tested on the touchstone of the tests and safeguards, enumerated above,
I am of the opinion that the defence has miserably failed to approve the
authenticity of the cassette as well as the accuracy of the voice purportedly
made by the CW-9 Sh. Arun Kumar CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 937 Mishra. In view of the
discussion, there is no force in the argument of the Ld. Defence Counsel that
the confessional statement of CW-8 and purported tape-recorded statement of
CW-9 are relevant for consideration to adjudicate the matter and it is not
such a hypothesis to give any benefit of doubt to the accused persons. Merely
because, he was arrested during investigation as a suspect does not mean that
there was some evidence against him. Many persons including CW-9 were arrested
in this case by the Investigation Officer and ultimately, Investigation
Officer filed the charge sheet against the accused persons facing the trial.
In the meanwhile, CW-9 was granted bail by the competent court U/s. 167 (2)
(a) of Cr. PC. He has not owned his alleged voice in the conversation recorded
by Jailor Rehman in Samastipur Jail except only one dialogue, which is not
incriminatory at all. The defence has failed to prove that the voice in the
cassette was of CW-9 and there was no scope of tampering with the cassette,
soon after the conversation was recorded in view of the law laid down by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram Singh's case and R.M. Malkhani's case (supra).
Even otherwise, it has come in his deposition that he was subject to torture
in the Jail and he was made to read from a prepared statement. There is no
evidence at all on the record to show involvement CW-9 in the crime. When
there was no evidence against him, on filing of application before the
competent court, he was discharged by the court on 20.11.1975, which order has
attained finality.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 938
902\. Now, I propose to deal with the issue of recording of conversation
between the Jailor and PW-2 Vikram in Danapur Jail on 30.09.1978. In this
regard, the defence has cross-examined PW-2 in detail. In his cross-
examination, PW-2 answered that on 30.09.1978, he was in Danapur Sub-Jail. At
that time, there was a Jailor namely Haider Ali and a Doctor namely D. Ram. He
testified that on 30.09.1978, there was a conversation between him, Jailor and
the Doctor in his compartment and at that time, they told him that some
officers of Bihar Government wanted to meet him and he was taken to the office
from his compartment. He was introduced to two officers of Bihar Government.
He was told that one of them was Home Secretary and the other was Law
Secretary. He has denied the suggestion that he was tutored by CBI. He has
also denied that CBI officers gave him severe beatings on his leg or he
suffered wounds on his body.
903\. At Page No. 38 of cross-examination of PW-2, it is mentioned that Sh. D.
Goburdhan, Advocate for Bihar Government has supplied a transcript "Mark-Z" to
the court on 25.05.1981. It is mentioned in the order dated 04.06.1981 of the
Predecessor of this court that tape was summoned from the Government of Bihar
pursuant to the application moved by Sh. P.P. Grover, Advocate on behalf of
the accused. Sh. D. Goburdhan, Advocate of Bihar Government produced the tape
as received by him from the Bihar Government. As per the order sheet dated
09.07.1981 of my Ld. Predecessor, the sealed CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 939 envelopes
believed to contain the cassette was opened in the presence of the accused
persons and counsel for the parties and it was directed that tape-recorder
would be played to compare the transcript or prepare another one. The tape was
played but the court found certain omissions here and there and the cassette
was ordered to be re-sealed. Sealed envelope was opened again in the court on
10.07.1981 and tape-recorder was played. Another transcription Mark-Z-1 sent
by the Bihar Government was corrected. Here it is pertinent to note that on
that day, Vikram was not present in the court and it is not on the record as
to whether the cassette found in the envelope was a sealed one or not. It is
also not in evidence that the cassette was not tampered with after recording
the voice/conversation with PW-2 by the Jailor. The Jailor of Danapur Jail has
also not been examined as a witness. PW-2 was not present in the court, when
the transcription Mark-Z-1 was corrected. It is also not mentioned in the
order sheet as to who identified the voices contained in the tape. On
15.07.1981 onward, PW-2 was further cross-examined on several dates by the
defence and he was confronted with this second transcription Mark-Z- 1 without
playing the tape on the tape-recorder. The record reveals on 19.08.1981,
during his cross-examination, PW-2 requested the court that tape should be
played on the tape-recorder to know whether it contained his voice. Then the
tape was played on the tape-recorder and a sealed parcel containing the
cassette was taken out. PW-2 admitted his voice, which is mentioned in the
transcription Mark-Z-1 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 940 from the portion from R-1, R-2
R-3, R-5, R-6, R-7, R-11, A-1, A-2, A-13, R-15, R-16, R-17, R-18, R-19, R-21,
R-22 and R-23. However, he testified that he had read out this statement from
a typed one. He did not know that his statement was being tape-recorded. After
hearing the tape-recorder in the court, he could say that it was recorded
during his rehearsal. In his further cross-examination, PW-2 replied that CID
Officers of Bihar Police used to come to Patna Jail carrying an attaché and
they had asked him to read out a typed matter. He answered that when he was
reading the statement, one attaché case was kept lying at a distance of 5 or 6
feet from him. He has denied the suggestion that tape-recorded statement is a
voluntary disclosure made by him or that the tape was not recorded during
rehearsal. In his further cross-examination, PW-2 answered that Jailor at
Danapur told him that the Government has withdrawn the case against him and
DIR warrant was removed and there was no question of giving him pardon. He
further replied that statement before the Jailor was obtained from him by
coercion and the same is incorrect. He answered that he was lodged in Danapur
Jail on 03.01.1977 and prior to that he was in Tihar Central Jail. PW-2 has
denied the suggestion that in Danapur Jail, several officers of CBI namely Sh.
B.R. Puri, Sh. H.L. Ahuja, Sh. M.P. Singh amongst others visited him several
times or that CBI officers used to make cash payment to him in the presence of
Haider Ali, Assistant Jailor, Danapur Sub-Jail. He deposed that he refused to
see his mother as he had seen her accompanied by many Anand Margi CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 941 in the court. He has also refused to meet her in the Jail and had
given it in the writing to the Jailor. He replied that he met his mother only
once in Danapur Jail during his confinement there and elsewhere. PW- 2 in his
further cross-examination deposed that he was threatened by them that in case
he does not read out the statement given to him, he would be killed by falsely
showing that he had made an attempt to escape from the jail. He testified that
whatever tape-recorded statement was elicited from him had been done by threat
of being beaten and killed. He has read out from a prepared typed statement.
He testified that he has narrated to the Chief Secretary that he is being
pressurized to make a false statement and Chief Secretary informed him that
Bihar Government did not want to pursue the case and he should make the
statement in the manner, his officers asking him to do so. He made the
statement as he was told to do by the Law Secretary and Home Secretary and
later on he came to know that those officers were SP and DSP. He deposed that
he had stated what was desired by Jailor and Doctor, as they used to
intimidate him.
(These transcriptions Mark-Z and Mark-Z-1 are available in File No. R-43- I to
VII).
904\. Prosecution has placed on record three letters, which were received by
them from approver PW-2 Vikram after filing of the charge sheet alleging that
he had been tortured in the Jail by the Jailor, Doctor and officers of CID,
Bihar and he was compelled to make a statement. On this point, it is elicited
by the defence from PW-2 in his CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 942 cross-examination that he
had written in the letter for shifting him outside for safety, since he feared
death without telling the truth. It is important to note that these letters
were got exhibited by the defence in cross-examination of PW-2. He deposed
that in the inland letter Ex.PW-2/DG, he did not mention the names of the
police officers. He admitted that on the inland letter Ex.PW-2/DG, he has
mentioned the address of Sh. M.P. Singh in his handwriting at point
Ex.PW-2/DG-2. He testified that the letter Ex.PW-2/DH is in his handwriting.
He used to send the letters to Sh. M.P. Singh, DSP, CBI at his official
address Central Bureau of Investigation, Special Establishment, CIU (P)
Branch, East Block, Sector-7, R.K. Puram, New Delhi-110022. He was shown the
envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1, where this address of M.P. Singh is not found
mentioned. He admitted that the writing encircled 'X' on the envelope
Ex.PW-2/DH-1 is in his handwriting. (On this envelope, at point X, the address
of "Mr. M.P. Singh, DSP, CBI" is mentioned). He replied that the correction at
Point A & B on t he letter Ex.PW-2/DH are in his handwriting. He deposed that
he had gone through this letter and corrected the mistakes. He admitted that
envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1 does not bear any Indian Postal Stamp. He asserted that
the letter Ex.PW-2/DJ and address on the envelope Ex.PW-2/DJ-1 are in his
handwriting, but he has not mentioned sender's name and address on the
envelope. He further deposed that the address on the envelope Ex.PW-2/DJ-1
pertaining to letter Ex.PW- 2/DJ is also in his handwriting. In his further
cross-examination, PW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 943 2 deposed that there is no interpolation or change of
date in the letter Ex.PW-2/DJ at Point X-1. He has denied the suggestion that
CBI got written a letter from a person well conversant with English language
and then a letter on loose paper was got written from him and produced in the
court along with Envelope Ex.PW-2/DJ for the first time.
905\. In his re-examination, PW-2 deposed at Page No. 335 that the letter
Ex.PW-2/DH consisting of ten pages in English is in his handwriting and the
date is 20.08.79. He deposed that the envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1 was sent to him by
Harjeet Singh Ahluwalia from England, who was earlier an approver in a Bank
Van Robbery case. In his further cross-examination after re-examination, PW-2
deposed that the writing Ex.PW-2/DH-2 on the envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1 is in the
handwriting of Sh. Harjeet Singh Ahluwalia, who remained with him for two
years in Tihar Jail and after his release from Jail, he went to England.
Harjeet Singh Ahluwalia was kept in his room in the Jail. He is not aware of
his complete address, but the locality is "Betfont Road, Middleex". In his
further cross-examination, PW-2 admitted the suggestion that he had written
the letter Ex.PW-2/DJ in December 1978, letter Ex.PW-2/DH in February 1979 and
third letter Ex.PW- 2/DG approximately during that period. He denied the
suggestion that his three letters filed by the CBI in the court during cross-
examination are forged one and prepared during the pendency of the
proceedings.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 944 He also denied the suggestion that he has been on pay
role of CBI and deposed falsely.
906\. I have perused the blue colour inland Letter, which is from the outer
side given the exhibit mark as Ex.PW-2/DG and its contents portion inside are
given exhibit mark as Ex.PW-2/DG-1. This letter addressed to Sh. M.P. Singh,
DSP, CBI, Special Police Establishment, CIU Branch, East Block-VII, R.K.
Puram, New Delhi-110022. It bears the round stamp of the Post Office "Danapur
Cantt." dated 25.07.1979 and RL (i.e. Registered Letter) No. 1298 of D. Cantt.
It also bears the round postal stamp of the receiving Post Office R.K. Puram
dated 28.07.1979. In this letter, PW-2 has written to DSP, CBI that the
officers of CID used to visit and threaten him to make a statement in the
court against CBI and on 01st June, 17-20 June, those persons came and told
him that they would not allow CBI to proceed with the case. He further
mentioned that Jailor and Doctor had directed him to make the statement
against CBI to the effect that this case has been fabricated against innocent
persons. He has further mentioned that the Jailor has started enough pressure
on him and there was a threat to his life in Bihar otherwise, he would have to
depart this world. No doubt, the sender name is mentioned as "P.P. Singh, Beli
Road, Patna", which appears to have been written by PW-2 for security purposes
and for ensuring that the letter reaches to the addressee i.e. CBI, without
being caught or seen by Jailor or CID persons.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 945
907\. I have also seen letter Ex.PW-2/DH, which is written on 10 pages of a
lined notebook. This letter dated 20.08.1979 has been written by Vikram in
poor English language. He has detailed his grievance in this letter to the
effect that Jailor and Doctor had visited him on several dates in September,
October, November and December 1978 and January to March 1979 to pressurize
him to make the statement in the court. He has further mentioned that he was
tortured and beaten by them and they have also given him a typed copy of a
paper in question answer form and DIG asked him to give those answers and his
voice had been recorded. This letter was addressed to Mr. M.P. Singh, DSP, CBI
in the envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1. On the front portion of the envelope, PW-2
struck out his name and address. This envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1 bears the round
postal stamp of "Hounston, Middlesex, dated 10.08.1979 and a sticker with the
inscription of "By air mail Par Avion" is pasted on the left top corner. It
also bears a postal ticket of UK. It does not bear any stamp of any Indian
Post Office. It does not bear the name of the sender. However, on this
envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1, the name of "Mr. Vikram, C/o Jailor Sahib, Danapur Sub
Jail, Danapur (Patna) 801503, Bihar, India" is struck out and above this
address, this name and address "Mr. M.P. Singh, DSP, CBI" is mentioned.
908\. Ex.PW-2/DJ is third letter in Hindi written by Vikram, which was
received in the office of CBI, New Delhi on 22.12.1978. This CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 946 was found to contain in the envelope Ex.PW-2/DJ-1. This is
addressed to Dy. Superintendant of Police, Central Bureau of Investigation,
Special Police Establishment, CIU (P) Branch, East Block-VII, R.K. Puram, New
Delhi-110022. This bears the round stamp of the Post Office Danapur Cantt.
dated 19.12.1978. It also bears the round shaped postal stamp dated 21.12.1978
of Delhi Post Office having Pin No. 110001. The stamp dated 21.12.1978 must be
of GPO. Then there is another round stamp of "Rama Krishna Puram Post Office"
on which the impression of the date is not completely visible.
In this letter also, he has written his grievance against the Jailor informing
him that Home Secretary and Law Secretary, Bihar would be visiting the Jail
and he (PW-2) was directed to speak everything in the court. Next day, those
persons introduced to Home Secretary and Law Secretary and Jailor had slapped
him four or five times and then on instructions of the Jailor, a constable,
who was standing near the gate, was called and he gave him beatings by fists
several times. He was tortured. They directed him to make only the statement,
which they have given him. On third day, they had given him a written paper
and compelled to read it.
909\. Prosecution has examined Deputy SP Sh. M.P. Singh, CBI, New Delhi as
PW-131, who remained associated with the investigation of this case from
08.01.1975 to 29.08.1976 and he has assisted Chief Investigation Officer Sh.
H.L. Ahuja, Deputy SP, CBI (PW-151) in the Investigation as per his
directions. All these letters CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 947 from Vikram were received by
Sh. M.P. Singh (PW-131). The defence has asked this witness about the above
said three letters, which he received from PW-2. PW-131 replied in his cross-
examination that he received three letters from Vikram (PW-2). He answered
that he did not contact Vikram to ascertain whether he wrote these letters. He
knew that Vikram was approver and lodged at Danapur Jail in Patna. He did not
visit the Jail, where Vikram was detained. He has denied the suggestion that
he has got written these letters from PW-2 and for that reason he had not gone
to Vikram to confirm whether he had written these letters. He admitted that he
received the letter Ex.PW- 2/DG-1 in July 1979 and he handed over this letter
within a couple of days to the Chief Investigation Officer. He answered that
the letter Ex.PW-2/DH contained in the envelope Ex.PW-2/DH-1 was received by a
constable of Patna Office of CBI on his return to the Patna Branch Office from
field duty. The constable, on inquiry, told him that someone has delivered
this letter, but could not give him the particulars.
910\. In his further cross-examination, PW-2 denied the suggestion of the
defence that CBI has persuaded him to write a letter to the Chief Justice of
India during the Transfer Application of this case from Bihar Court to Delhi
Court and he voluntarily stated that he of his own had written a letter to the
Chief Justice of India. He has mentioned in the letter to the Chief Justice of
India as to how his statement has been obtained, which was tape-recorded and
he would be prepared to tell CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 948 the truth to the Chief
Justice in this respect. He also mentioned in the letter that a typed
statement was supplied to him. He replied that he had written a similar letter
to CBI, Delhi one or two month before writing letter to Chief Justice of
India. He did not go to post the letters and gave the same to the workers, who
came to him for the purpose of cleaning or serving him meals. He had addressed
the letter written to CBI to Sh. M.P. Singh, who was DSP at the address of
R.K. Puram. In his further cross-examination by accused Ranjan Dwivedi, PW-2
denied the suggestion that CBI got written these letters from him in Delhi and
two of these letters were got written during the pendency of the proceedings
in this court. He voluntarily stated that he had written these letters from
Danapur Jail. He explained that Jail authorities used to provide postal
stationary. He stated that the copy book on which letters Ex.PW-2/DJ and
Ex.PW-2/DH was provided to him by the Jailor and from that copy book, he had
taken out these sheets. Regarding this blue slip pasted on the envelope
Ex.PW-2/DH-1, he again explained that he had received this envelope from a
foreign country and he put the letter in this envelope and gave it to
Mushakati with the instructions that he would find Sh. M.P. Singh at 2/8,
Bailey Road, where the letter was to be delivered by hand otherwise he should
put it another envelope and post it after pasting the slip containing the
address. He did not remember the date of writing third letter Ex.PW-2/DG-1,
but it was written around February 1979.

(Shahdara)  Page No. 949
911\. The Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati and Sh. Feroz Ahmad, Advocates,
have argued that these letters have been filed by the prosecution after filing
of the charge-sheet and should not be considered. They further argued that the
prosecution has failed to prove that these letters are in the handwriting of
PW-2 and that prosecution has filed these forged and fabricated letters and
envelopes only to create evidence. They also argued that prosecution has filed
these fabricated letters with malafide intention in order to persuade this
case not to rely upon the tape-recorded version of PW-2 Vikram in Danapur
Jail.
912\. I have scrutinized the statement of PW-2 on the aforesaid points of
sending letters by him. The prosecution has not filed on record any letter
written by PW-2 to the Chief Justice of India regarding his grievance that he
was subject to torture in the Jail or that he was made to speak from a
prepared statement, which was tape recorded. However, by giving the suggestion
to PW-2 by the defence that CBI got written from him a letter to CJI during
the pendency of the Transfer Petition, has admitted that PW-2 had written a
letter to CJI as claimed by him. In his cross-examination, PW-2 has admitted
the suggestion of the defence that on the letter Ex.PW-2/DG, he has mentioned
the address of Sh. M.P. Singh in his handwriting at point Ex.PW-2/DG-2. The
defence in the cross-examination has not discredited the testimony of PW-2
that he had written the letter Ex.PW-2/DG. In his cross-examination, PW-2 has
admitted the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 950 suggestion of the defence that at Point
"X" on the envelope Ex.PW- 2/DH-1, where the address of the addressee is
mentioned, is in his handwriting. At point "X", the name and designation of
the addressee "Sh. M.P. Singh, DSP, CBI" is mentioned. In his further cross-
examination he has explained that he had given it to Mushakati with the
instructions that he would find Sh. M.P. Singh at 2/8, Bailey Road, where the
letter was to be delivered by hand otherwise he should put it another envelope
and post it after pasting the slip containing the address. It is found in the
testimony of PW-2 that the letter Ex.PW- 2/DH is in his handwriting. The
defence has not at all discredited the PW-2 in his cross-examination that the
letter Ex.PW-2/DH was not in his handwriting or that he had not given this
letter to Mushakati for delivery to Sh. M.P. Singh. The defence has also not
shattered the assertion of PW-2 that the letter Ex.PW-2/DJ and the address on
the envelope Ex.PW-2/DJ-1 are not in his handwriting in his cross-
examination. Rather, the defence has admitted that the letter Ex.PW- 2/DJ
pertained to the envelope Ex.PW-DJ-1. PW-2 has further admitted the suggestion
of the defence that he had written the letter Ex.PW-2/DJ in the mother of
December 1978, letter Ex.PW-2/DH in February 1979 and letter Ex.PW-2/DJ around
February 1979. By giving the suggestion to PW-2 in his cross-examination that
CBI got written these letters from him in Delhi, also by itself suggest
admission on behalf of the defence that these letters are in the handwriting
of PW-2. Further, the defence has admitted the writing of CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 951
these letters in the handwriting of PW-2 by giving suggestion to PW- 131 that
he got written these letters from PW-2 and for that reason he had not gone to
Vikram to confirm whether he had written these letters. Moreover, all these
three letters and two envelopes were got exhibited in the cross-examination of
PW-2 by the defence and that by itself indicate admission of the documents by
them.
913\. In view of the above discussion, there is no force in the arguments of
the Ld. Defence Counsel that CBI should have proved that these three letters
and two envelopes are the handwriting of PW-2. These letters sufficiently
establish that approver PW-2, while being kept in Danapur Jail was subject to
extreme torture and harassment at the hands of Jailor, Jail Doctor and
officers of CID and establishment and he was made to make a statement by the
Jailor to retract his confession made to Ld. ACMM, Delhi.
914\. It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that after arrest of Arun Kumar
Thakur and Arun Kumar Mishra by the prosecution and recording of confessional
statement of Arun Kumar Thakur, the investigating agency, which is under the
control of Central Government, changed the line of investigation without any
justification and falsely implicated Anand Margies with malafide intention.
They argued that this was the deliberate attempt of CBI under the pressure of
the Central Government to divert the attention from real culprits. They argued
that the then Director of CBI Sh. D.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 952 Sen was about to retire in November 1975 and he was
granted extension in service as Director, CBI and he was also awarded Padama
Bhushan Award on the following Republic Day. They also submitted that the wife
of late Sh. L.N. Mishra has lodged a complaint on the basis of which the then
Chief Minister has ordered a "secret inquiry", which was conducted by the then
DIG, CID, Bihar namely Sh. Shashi Bhushan Sahai (DW-40). It was pointed out
that even as per report of DIG, the crime dated 02.01.1975 was not committed
by the Anand Margies facing the trial, but by Arun Kumar Thakur, Arun Kumar
Mishra and Shiv Kumar Vishwakarma on the direction of Sh. Ram Bilas Jha (MLC),
who was known as "Boss Jha". The report of Sh. Shashi Bhushan Sahai (DW-40)
was considered by Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate on the direction of the
then Chief Minister and he has also filed his report in favour of accused
persons. Based on these submissions, the Ld. Defence Counsel submits that this
is a straight hypothesis, which goes in favour of the accused persons and they
should be given benefit of doubt.
915\. Here, I would like to refer the relevant evidence pointed out by the Ld.
Defence Counsel. Ex.DW-12/C is copy of the letter No.946 dated 30.8.1978
written by the then Chief Minister of Bihar addressed to the then Prime
Minister of India mentioning therein that pursuant to the confidential one to
one discussion, he had directed for secret enquiry in respect of murder of
Late Sh. L.N. Mishra. After the completion of the secret enquiry, he would
send him a copy and if he CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 953 (Prime Minister) is satisfied, he
(Prime Minister) might take up the matter with the Central Bureau of
Investigation. Photocopy of the report submitted by Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40)
dated 24.10.1978 is Ex.DW-12/B. The carbon copy of report of Sh. S.B. Sahai is
Ex.DW- 40/1. The letter Ex.DW-12/C and Photostat copy of the report of DW- 40
are Ex.DW-12/B are available in Part-XXIV. The carbon copy of the report of
DW-40 is Ex.DW-40/1, which is available in Folder R-
309\.
916\. Defence has examined Sh. Shashi Bhushan Sahai, the then DIG, CID, Bihar
as DW-40. He proved copy of his affidavit dated 11.12.1979, which he filed in
the Hon'ble Supreme Court Ex.DW-6/A (Available in Folder R-57). In his
affidavit filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court DW-40 deposed that 18 CBI
officers led by D.N. Ahuja, DIG, CBI left New Delhi for Bihar on 03.1.1975 by
a Special Plane and arrived at Samastipur in the forenoon of 04.1.1975. They
have assisted the CBI team in the investigation of both these cases of
Samastipur from 04.1.1975 to 10.1.1975. The CBI had taken over the
investigation of the case from State CID on 10.1.1975. At that time, they have
passed information to CBI relating to two suspects. CBI formally arrested both
these suspects in Mishra's murder case on 08.1.1975 after recovery of some
incriminatory documents from their house and statement of eyewitness Shankar
before the CID and CBI. Sh. Shankar made a statement to CID & CBI to the
effect that he had seen both these Arun Kumars running away from near the
Rostrum at CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 954 the conclusion of Late Sh. L.N. Mishra's speech
and immediately preceding the blast. Arun Kumar Thakur made a voluntary
statement regarding his complicity in the bomb blast. He made inculpatory
statement and regarding complicity of his friend Arun Kumar Mishra and one
accomplice Sheo Narain Sharma and an outsider named "Boss Jha", the man behind
the crime. On initial interrogation of Arun Kumar Mishra, he mentioned the
names of Uma Kant Jha and Joginder Raut as instigators of the crime and on
close enquiry allegations against them were found incorrect.
917\. DW-40 Sh. S.B. Sahai deposed that he received an order from the then
Chief Minister, Bihar to conduct a "confidential enquiry" into the case
relating to the murder of Sh. L.N. Mishra vide his "top secret" letter No.946
dated 30.8.1978 and pursuant to that direction he made a "confidential
enquiry" with the assistance of Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-34) and Sh. K.P. Sinha, DSP,
CID. After completion of the "confidential enquiry", he submitted a detailed
"Top Secret Report" to the then Chief Minister, Bihar vide memo no.51/C dated
24.10.1978. The then Chief Minister, Bihar requested Sh. V.M. Tarkunde to give
his legal opinion on the confidential enquiry report regarding L.N. Mishra
murder case. Sh. Tarkunde prepared his opinion and submitted to the then Chief
Minister, Bihar.
918\. In his examination-in-chief DW-40 Sh. S.B. Sahai testified that he was
aware of the incident of bomb attack on 02.1.1975 was made CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 955 on L. N. Mishra. He visited the place of occurrence on 03.1.1975.
FIR was lodged and CID Bihar started investigation until 09.1.1975. CBI has
taken over the investigation of the case on 10.1.1975. However, CID, Bihar
kept assisting CBI until 3rd week of March 1975. After 3rd Week of March, CID
Bihar was disassociated with the investigation of the case and thereafter CBI
did everything. He made enquiry through his officers about the role of Vikram
(PW-2) and Madan Mohan Srivastava (PW-1) in this case. He authorized Jailor
and Supdt. of Jail, Danapur to record the statement of Vikram on a tape
recorder. The tape-recorded statement of Vikram was not given to him but he
heard it. It was between Sh. D.P. Ahuja, SP (Vigilance) and Sh. K.P. Sinha,
Dy. SP, CID. The then Chief Secretary, Sh. Ram Subramanium personally talked
to Vikram's cell in Danapur Jail and was satisfied. The statement of Vikram
recorded as taped by Danapur Jailor was contradictory to his earlier
statement. Under the order of Chief Minister, Bihar, he met Sh. Tarkunde after
submitting his Report Ex.DW-40/1. He also met Sh. Arun Shourie (DW-16) in
Delhi and discussed the case. He informed Sh. Arun Shourie (DW-16) that as per
his findings, the present case investigated by CBI is false. The object of his
enquiry was to find out the truth as Smt. Kameshwari Mishra wife of late Sh.
L.N. Mishra lodged a complaint to the Chief Minister, Bihar that wrong persons
have been implicated. The then CM of Bihar asked him to make an enquiry. He
submitted his report dated 24.10.1978 running into 21 pages Ex.DW-40/1 to the
then CM, Bihar CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 956 through the Chief Secretary. He associated
Sh. D.P. Ojha, the then SP (Vigilance) and Sh. K.P. Sinha, DSP, CID actively
in conduct of the enquiry. He knew the fact that CBI had already filed charge
sheet. He conducted a "secret enquiry" as per the direction of the CM, Bihar.
919\. In his cross-examination, it is elicited that he personally did not
record the statement of any witnesses. He prepared the rough notes based on
which he prepared his report Ex.DW-40/1. He did not preserve those rough
notes. He did not record the statement of Smt. Kameshwari Mishra in writing.
He did not know whether Smt. Kameshwari Mishra made her complaint to the then
Chief Minister, Bihar in writing or orally. He did not submit enclosure of any
statements or rough notes with his enquiry report Ex.DW-40/1. He is not aware
if the State Government or Central Government took any action on submitting
the report. To a question whether any attempt was made to file any additional
charge sheet in the concerned court, he replied that he did not know since in
the year 1979 he went on deputation out of the State of Bihar. He did not know
personally about Madan Mohan Srivastava. He deposed that the officers
assisting him made a specific enquiry about antecedents and involvement in
this case. He interrogated Vikram in Danapur Jail and examined him after his
statement was tape recorded by the Jailor. He did not record his statement
formally. Before tape recording of the statement of Vikram, he did not see him
in the jail. He had not authorized the Jailor and Superintendent of Danapur
Jail in writing to record the statement of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 957 Vikram on a
tape recorder. He did not know if this fact was recorded in any case diary. He
was not personally present when the statement of Vikram was tape recorded and
hence could not say what were the circumstances and conditions at the time
when the statement of Vikram was tape recorded.
920\. I have perused the Report Ex.DW-40/1. DW-40 Sh. Shashi Bhushan Sahai has
emerged with the following conclusion of his secret enquiry:-
> "1. Names of two Arun Kumars figured as suspects in the murder in the very
> first week of investigation. Subsequently, a natural eye witness, Shankar,
> claimed identification of Arun Kumar Thakur and Arun Kumar Mishra on the
> spot of the bomb blast. Arun Kumar Thakur made a judicial confession on
> 21.2.75 about the crime in which he named Arun Kumar Mishra, Sheo Narain
> Sharma and one unknown person, besides himself. He also mentioned about the
> Boss "Jha" as a planner of the crime.
2\. While the search to identify Boss "Jha" was going on, the other accused
Arun Kumar Mishra made certain disclosures in Samastipur Jail before the
Jailor Sri Rehman giving some details of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 958 conspiracy
and revealing the name of Ram Bilas Jha as the planner of the crime.
3\. The disclosure of the name of Ram Bilash Jha as one of the main
conspirators behind the murder brought about a sea change in the attitude of
the C.B.I. towards this line of investigation. This line of investigation was
abruptly closed and valuable evidence obtained during the first three months
of investigation was completely suppressed.
4\. The main reason behind suppression of this line of investigation was that
Ram Bilash Jha was a close associate of Sri Yashpal Kapoor and also had direct
contact with Smt. Gandhi. Sri D. Sen, the then Director of the C.B.I., had
clearly told Smt. Kameshwari Mishra that to mention Ram Bilash Jha's name in
this case would lead to Sh. Yashpal Kapoor and further up.
5\. Smt. Gandhi's keen interest in this affair is evident from the query she
made from Sri Ghafoor, the then Chief Minister, Bihar, in the last week of
March, 1975 about some alleged favour shown to the Samastipur jailor, Sri
Rahman. Since the Samastipur Jailor had succeeded in ascertaining the name of
Sri Ram Bilash Jha as one CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 959 of the planners of the murder,
Smt. Gandhi was obviously unhappy with the Jailor and the then Chief Minister,
Sri Ghafoor. No wonder that Sri D. Sen, the then Director of the C.B.I. could
not dare pursue the investigation against Ram Bilash Jha.
6\. Sri Yashpal Kapoor's sojourn in Bihar before and after the bomb blast and
his movements during this period appear to be highly suspicious. Close
association between Ram Bilash Jha and Sri Yashpal Kapoor is a well known
fact. In the circumstances, there is a clear suspicion about Sri Yashpal
Kapoor and Ram Bilash Jha having jointly planned Sri L.N. Mishra's murder.
7\. The subsequent investigation of this case by the C.B.I. implicating some
Anand Margis was a part of the deliberate attempt to divert attention from the
real culprits who were close to the seat of power. In this attempt false
confessional statements were extorted by means of physical torture and inhuman
third degree methods. Due processes of law and rules of jail Manuals were open
flouted to keep the principal tutored witness of the cooked-up case under
constant terror and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 960 undue influence. The whole case
was built up by the C.B.I. under the cover of the emergency when legal
processes were under great strains. Charge- sheet was submitted against the
Anand Margis by the C.B.I. on 10th November, 1975. It is not without
significant that Sh. D. Sen, who was due to retire in November, 1975, was
granted extension of service as Director of the C.B.I. He was also decorated
with 'Padam Bhushan' on the following Republic day".
921\. Admittedly, in this case the charge sheet was filed by Investigation
Officer on 12.11.1975 before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna. Committal
proceedings were still pending before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna,
where after the tender of pardon, both the approvers Vikram @ Jaldhar Dass @
Subir and Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand @ Vijay were to be examined
as a witness, taking the cognizance of the offence as required under sub-
clause (a) of sub-section (4) of section 306 of Cr. PC. I have appreciated the
issue in my subsequent paragraphs of this judgment as to how the accused
persons in collusion with the Authorities, Jailor and Jail Doctor did not
allow the same to be completed in order to build and put pressure on approver
Vikram lying in Danapur Jail to retract from his confessional statement. This
was also done to blame and defame CBI for his making confessional CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 961 statement before the ACMM, Delhi on 16.08.1975 and 18.08.1975 and
consequent grant of pardon to him on 27.10.1975. Much after filing of the
charge sheet, the then Chief Minister of the State of Bihar vide Letter No.
946 dated 30.08.1978 Ex.PW-12/C directed "Secret Inquiry" to be conducted by
the officers of the State. Here it is worth mentioning that vide notification
No. 54 dated 03.01.1975 Ex.PW- 64/D, the Governor of Bihar gave the consent of
the Government of Bihar to the members of Delhi Special Police Establishment
under Section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 for extension
of their powers and jurisdiction in the whole of the State of Bihar for
investigation of the offences with regard to case No. 1 of 02.01.1975, PS
Samastipur. Vide notification No. 55 dated 03.01.1975 Ex.PW-64/E, the Governor
of Bihar gave the consent of the Government of Bihar to the members of Delhi
Special Police Establishment under Section 6 of Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act, 1946 for extension of their powers and jurisdiction in the
whole of the State of Bihar for investigation of the offences with regard to
case No. 1 of 02.01.1975, PS Samastipur GRPS. Vide notification dated
13.09.1975 Ex.PW-64/A, the Governor of Bihar has also given its consent to
Delhi Special Police Establishment under Section 6 of Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act, 1946 in respect of FIR No. 24 dated 07.01.1974 PS Kotwali
Patna. The Governor of Bihar has also accorded the consent of Government of
Bihar vide notification Ex. PW-64/B dated 13.09.1975, to the members of Delhi
Special Police CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 962 Establishment under Section 6 of Delhi
Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 in respect of FIR No. 71 dated
13.07.1974 PS Kotwali Bhagalpur.
(All four notifications Ex.PW-64/A, Ex.PW-64/B, Ex.PW-64/D and Ex.PW-64/E are
available in Folder R-7) The Governor of Bihar by order No. 6905 dated
27.12.1975 Ex.PW- 64/C has also accorded the consent of the Government of
Bihar for the prosecution and trial of the charge sheeted persons for the
offences under Section 4 and 5 of Explosive Substance Act, 1908 in respect of
the above said FIRs dated 07.01.1974, 13.07.1974 and 02.01.1975.
(The notification Ex.PW-64/C is available in Folder R-68)
922\. Here, it would be profitable to advert to sub-section (8) of Section 173
of Cr. PC, which reads as under: -
> "(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude further
> investigation in respect of an offence after a report under sub-section (2)
> has been forwarded to the Magistrate and, where upon such investigation, the
> officer Incharge of the police station obtains further evidence, oral or
> documentary, he shall forward to the Magistrate a further report or reports
> regarding such evidence in the form prescribed; and the provisions of sub-
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 963 sections (2) to (6) shall, as far as may be, apply
> in relation to such report or reports as they apply in relation to a report
> forwarded under sub-section (2).
923\. A plain reading of section 173 of Cr. PC reflects that even after filing
of the Final Investigation Report by the Investigation Officer, under sub-
section (2) of Section 173 of Cr. PC, the Magistrate may direct the
investigation officer on his request to conduct further investigations and
report to the Magistrate under sub-section (8) of Section 173 of Cr. PC. In
this regard, a catena of judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court can be
referred to. Suffice it to refer the one of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Dinesh Dalmia Vs. C.B.I. 2008 (AIR) SC 78, that: -
> "16. Indisputably, the power of the investigating officer to make a prayer
> for making further investigation in terms of Sub-section (8) of Section 173
> is not taken away only because a charge sheet under Sub-section (2) thereof
> has been filed. A further investigation is permissible even if order of
> cognizance of offence has been taken by the Magistrate."
924\. It has also been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Reeta Naag Vs.
State of West Bengal & Ors., 2009 (9) SCC 129, that the CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 964
power of the Investigating Officer to make a prayer for conducting further
investigation in terms of Section 173 (8) of Cr. PC is not taken away only
because a charge- sheet has been filed under Section 173(2) and a further
investigation is permissible even if cognizance has been taken by the
Magistrate. The relevant Para of the judgment reads as under: -
> "17. In addition to the above, the decision of this Court in Randhir Singh
> Rana's case (supra) also makes it clear that after taking cognizance of an
> offence on the basis of a police report and after appearance of the accused,
> a Judicial Magistrate cannot of his own order further investigation in the
> case, though such an order could be passed on the application of the
> investigating authorities. The view expressed in Randhir Singh Rana's case

> Dalmia v. CBI, 2007(4) RCR(Criminal) 283 : 2007(5) RAJ 182 : [(2007)8 SCC
> 770], wherein while considering various provisions of the Criminal Procedure

19\. What emerges from the above-mentioned decisions of this Court is that
once a charge-sheet is filed under Section 173(2) Criminal Procedure Code and
either charge is framed or the accused are discharged, the Magistrate may, on
the basis of a protest petition, take cognizance of the offence CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 966 complained of or on the application made by the investigating
authorities permit further investigation under Section 173(8). The Magistrate
cannot suo moto direct a further investigation under Section 173(8) Criminal
Procedure Code or direct a re-investigation into a case on account of the bar
of Section 167(2) of the Code."
925\. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in Vinay Tyagi Vs. Irshad
Ali @ Deepak & Others, 2013 (5) SCC 762, that the Magistrate has power to
direct further investigation after filing of a police report in terms of
section 173 (8) of Cr. PC and the relevant Para are quoted below: -
> "30. Having analysed the provisions of the Code and the various judgments as
> afore-indicated, we would state the following conclusions in regard to the
> powers of a magistrate in terms of Section 173(2) read with Section 173(8)
> and Section 156(3) of the Code:
> 1\. The Magistrate has no power to direct 'reinvestigation' or 'fresh
> investigation' (de novo) in the case initiated on the basis of a police
> report.\
> 2\. A Magistrate has the power to direct 'further investigation' after
> filing of a police report in terms of Section 173(6) of the Code.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 967
> 3\. The view expressed in (2) above is in conformity with the principle of
> law stated in Bhagwant Singh's case (supra) by a three Judge Bench and thus
> in conformity with the doctrine of precedence.
> 4\. Neither the scheme of the Code nor any specific provision therein bars
> exercise of such jurisdiction by the Magistrate. The language of Section
> 173(2) cannot be construed so restrictively as to deprive the Magistrate of
> such powers particularly in face of the provisions of Section 156(3) and the
> language of Section 173(8) itself. In fact, such power would have to be read
> into the language of Section 173(8).
5\. The Code is a procedural document, thus, it must receive a construction
which would advance the cause of justice and legislative object sought to be
achieved. It does not stand to reason that the legislature provided power of
further investigation to the police even after filing a report, but intended
to curtail the power of the Court to the extent that even where the facts of
the case and the ends of justice demand, the Court can still not direct the
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 968 investigating agency to conduct further investigation
which it could do on its own.
6\. It has been a procedure of proprietary that the police has to seek
permission of the Court to continue 'further investigation' and file
supplementary charge-sheet. This approach has been approved by this Court in a
number of judgments. This as such would support the view that we are taking in
the present case."
926\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the position in law under
Section 173 of the Cr. PC regarding the powers of Magistrate for directing
further investigations in Hemant Dhasmana Versus Central Bureau of
Investigation 2001 (7) SCC 536, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has relied
upon its previous judgment and the relevant Para reads as under: -
> "18. In Bhagwant Singh v. Commissioner of Police and another, 1985(2) SCC
> 537 a three- Judge Bench of this Court has said, though in a slightly
> different context, that three options are open to the court on receipt of a
> report under Section 173(2) of the Code, when such report states that no
> offence has been committed by the persons accused in the complaint. They
> are:
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara)  Page No. 969 (1) The court may accept and drop the proceedings;
> or (2) The court may disagree with the report and take cognizance of the
> offence and issue process if it takes the view that there is sufficient
> ground for proceeding further; or (3) The court may direct further
> investigation to be made by the police.
927\. In view of the relevant provision i.e. Section 173 (8) of Cr. PC and
also the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is only the
court/Magistrate, which can direct further investigations on the request of
the Investigation Officer.
928\. In the present case, it is the then Chief Minister of the State of
Bihar, who had vide Order dated 30.08.1978 Ex.PW-12/C has ordered further
investigation by the officers of Government of Bihar, pursuant to which the
investigation was conducted by DW-40 Sh. S.B. Sahai, the then DIG, CID, Bihar.
Precise question that arises for consideration is whether the report of such
investigation has any legal sanctity under the provisions of Cr. PC and what
value could be attached to such a report. The scheme of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 envisages under what circumstances further investigation could
be ordered and who could order such an investigation. Chapter XII of the Code
of Cr. PC deals with the role of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 970 the police and the powers
of the police to investigate with regard to crimes.
929\. This Code does not permit conducting of an enquiry on the orders of a
Chief Minister of a State or ordering thereof by him, who is a political and
executive head of the State. All the information with regard to the cognizable
and non-cognizable offence is to be made only to the jurisdictional police.
Upon registering an FIR or obtaining permission from the jurisdictional
Magistrate, the police can proceed to investigate and submit its report to the
Magistrate concerned. Upon submission of such a report, the powers are vested
with the Magistrate alone and none else to order for further investigation u/s
173 (8) of Cr. PC. A bare perusal of the above provision shows that this
section does not limit the powers of the Magistrate and it is the Magistrate,
who alone can direct further investigation; obviously when such Magistrate
finds reasons to order for further investigation after considering the report
and submissions made to him by the Investigation Officer or aggrieved person.
930\. Therefore, the scheme of the Cr. PC does not permit the political and
executive head of a State to order for further investigation. The manner in
which such an order is passed by the Chief Minister titling it as a "secret
enquiry" cannot be considered as a report u/s 173 of Cr. PC. Therefore, this
court concludes that this CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 971 report and whatever the findings
thereof does not have any legal sanctity.
931\. Further, when the Governor of State of Bihar had already given the
consent of the Government of Bihar to the members of Delhi Special Police
Establishment under Section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946,
to conduct investigations in respect of all the four cases vide FIR No. 1 of
1975, PS Samastipur GRPS, FIR No. 1 of 1975 PS Samastipur, FIR No. 24 dated
07.01.1974 PS Kotwali Patna and FIR No. 71 dated 13.07.1974 PS Kotwali
Bhagalpur vide notifications Ex.PW-64/D, Ex.PW-65/E, Ex.PW-64/A and Ex.PW-
64/B, the political and executive head of the State i.e. the Chief Minister
cannot withdraw even its consent what to talk of conducting "secret inquiry"
by officer of the State. In this regard, a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in K. Chandrasekhar v. State of Kerala, 1998 AIR (SC) 2001, can be
referred to. It was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that after filing of the
charge sheet, if any further investigation is to be made, it is the C.B.I.
alone which can do so, as it was entrusted to investigate into the case by the
State Government.
932\. In view of this law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, even if
further investigation was required to be done, it was for the members of Delhi
Special Police Establishment, who should have been approached by the State
Government to make a request to the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 972 concerned
Magistrate to obtain permission to further investigate matter. Further, when
the charge sheet had already been filed on 12.11.1975, which was pending
before the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna for consideration, no efforts
have been made by the State of Bihar to move the Jurisdictional Magistrate
either directly or through Delhi Special Police Establishment for permission
to conduct further investigations in the cases.
933\. Moreover, DW-40 has admitted in his cross-examination that he has not
authorized the Jailor and Superintendant Jail of Danapur Jail in writing to
record the statement of Vikram. DW-40 is stated to have met Vikram in Danapur
Jail, but he has not personally recorded his statement in writing. He has also
not mentioned in his report as to when he had visited Danapur Jail to have
meeting with the approver Vikram. He has claimed that Chief Secretary of the
State had also visited Vikram in the Jail and talked to him. DW-40 does not
claim that Chief Secretary had also taken the statement of Vikram in writing.
Chief Secretary has also not been examined. No record of the Jail has been
filed as to when Chief Secretary had visited the Jail at Danapur to meet
Vikram. DW-40 has admitted in his deposition that he was aware of filing of
the charge sheet by the CBI and surprisingly he had continued with the "secret
inquiry". He also admitted that he personally did not record the statement of
any of the witnesses. He claimed to have prepared rough notes on the basis of
which he prepared the report Ex.DW-40/1, which have also not been placed on
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 973 record. He also admitted that he did not record the
statement of widow of the deceased. He also admitted that he was not aware
under what circumstances and conditions, the statement of Vikram was tape-
recorded. He has not annexed the copies of the statement of the witnesses, who
have been examined by him or the officers assisting him.
On the other hand, the testimony of PW-2, who deposed that he was put under
threat, torture and pressure by the Jailor and officers of CID Bihar and Chief
Secretary, Home Secretary and Law Secretary asking him to retract his
confession made before the Magistrate, is further corroborated by the version
of DW-40, who said that he visited the Jail and interacted the Vikram in his
Cell and further admits the visits of Chief Secretary also.
In view of the above discussion, the report of DW-40 can only be described to
be an opinion of an individual without any evidence and sanctity of law.
Therefore, such a report does not call for any scrutiny or indulgence of this
court to adjudicate or consider in accordance with law.
934\. The defence has examined DW-12 Sh. R.J.M. Pillai, Chief Secretary, State
of Bihar. He filed the unsigned copy of the opinion of Sh. V.M. Tarkunde Mark
DW-12/A. He also placed on record copy of Report of Inquiry dated 24.10.1978
into Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra's murder case of Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40), which
was exhibited as Ex.DW-12/B. He also placed on record a copy of the letter
dated CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 974 26.8.1978 sent by Sh. Karpuri Thakur, the then Chief
Minister of Bihar to the then Prime Minister Ex.DW-12/C. In his cross-
examination, DW-12 answered that Sh. Tarkunde had given only his opinion and
not any inquiry report. He admitted the suggestion of the prosecution that
opinion of Sh. Tarkunde is based on the report of the then DIG Sh. Sahai
(DW-40).
935\. It is argued by accused Ranjan Dwivedi in person, Ms. Sima Gulati,
Advocate and also by Sh. Feroz Ahmad, Advocate that Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior
Advocate, had also given his report that the Anand Margies facing the trial
are innocent and real culprits have been let off by the CBI at the instance of
the then Ruling Party at Centre. They have referred the Photostat copy of
Tarkunde's opinion Mark DW-12/A, which was exhibited as DW-16/A. (This is
available in Part-XXIV). (A similar Photostat copy of the report along with
the covering letter dated 15.02.1978 Mark PW-151/DQ of Sh. V.M. Tarkunde is
also available in Folder R-57). Unsigned Photostat copy of Tarkunde's Report
Mark DW-12/A was exhibited as DW-16/A, subject to objection by Ld. Special PP.
In the covering letter Mark PW-151/DQ, Sh. Tarkunde has written to the then
Chief Minister that pursuant to his talk on 15.02.1979 and subsequent letter
dated 09.02.1979, he had gone through the relevant documents and had three
conferences with Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40) and some other officers of the
Government of Bihar and prepared his legal opinion. I have gone through this
unsigned Photostat copy of legal opinion of Sh. V.M.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 975 Tarkunde and found that this opinion is entirely
based on confidential report dated 24.10.1978 Ex.DW-40/1 of Sh. S.B. Sahai
(DW-40), which is discarded by this court as beyond the scope of Cr. PC.
936\. During the course of arguments, the Ld. Special PP has pointed out that
DW-4 Sh. Rajeshwar Chaubey, who is the husband of sister of accused Ranjan
Dwivedi, has testified that Ranjan Dwivedi started living with him since
January 1973 till September 1974 and that Ranjan Dwivedi had been junior with
Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate. The Ld. Special PP has also pointed out a
copy of the Order dated 31.03.1978 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Criminal
Appeal No. 164 of 1978 titled as Ram Janam Dwivedi @ Ranjan Dwivedi Versus
State of Bihar and another, by which accused Ranjan Dwivedi was directed to be
released on bail on furnishing security of Rs.15,000/- with two sureties of
the like amount to the satisfaction of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna. This
order reflects that Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate had appeared for Sh.
Ranjan Dwivedi. The Ld. Special PP also pointed out that Ranjan Dwivedi has
been junior to Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate in the Hon'ble Supreme Court
and this fact has been admitted by Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement under
Section 313 of Cr. PC. While answering Q. No.374, in his statement under
Section 313 Cr. PC, Ranjan Dwivedi stated that in the year 1973 he came to
Delhi and joined Supreme Court Bar Association. He stated that since he was a
radical humanist, he came in contact with Mr. Justice V.M. Tarkunde, who
helped him to come CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 976 to the Supreme Court and worked
there as a junior till he was arrested in the year 1975. While replying Q.
No.9, he stated that from a member radical humanist headed by Ex. Chief
Justice V.M. Tarkunde, he became disciple of Anand Murtiji only based on his
concept of humanity and his relation to God as expressed in his book 'Human
Society' Part I & II. He stated that during this period, he developed
association with Anand Marg because of defending their cases including self-
immolation case against Santoshanand and he met Sh. Anand Murtiji and was
inspired by his two books "Human Society" Part I & II and subsequently, he
accepted him as his Guru. In the Appeal titled as "Santoshanand Avdoot Vs.
State, Manu/DE/1873/2014", pertaining to the case of attack on the then Chief
Justice of India Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Ray, the Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi, which is an offshoot of criminal conspiracy to get Baba released, while
upholding the conviction of accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand in Para No. 99
of the judgment, our Hon'ble High Court has also recorded the arguments of the
Ld. counsel for the State that the report of Justice Tarkunde was only an
opinion and not a piece of evidence and there was conflict of interest in
submitting the report as accused Ranjan Dwivedi was one of his juniors and was
represented by him in the case. I have already held in the preceding Para that
this report of Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40) does not require any indulgence and
consideration of this court for adjudication of the case and since the report
of Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 977 Advocate is based on the
report of Sh. S.B. Sahai Ex.DW-40/1, the said opinion has no value and is not
at all relevant.
937\. The Ld. Defence Counsel Sh. Feroz Ahmad has referred to the deposition
of Sh. Arun Shourie, former Executive Editor of Indian Express, who had been
examined by them as DW-16. He is the writer of the Book Ex.DW-5/B, titled as
"Who killed L.N. Mishra". The defence has also examined DW-5 Bhartendu Shah,
Branch Manager with M/s. Popular Prakashan with Darya Ganj, Delhi. He has been
examined to prove the publication of the book by the said firm titled as "who
killed L.N. Mishra". He testified that this is a compilation of various
articles written by various persons whose name appeared on the second page of
the book Ex.DW-5/B. On 15.02.2008, the court recorded his testimony. He had
been working with Popular Prakashan only for the last three years and
Ex.DW-5/B is a publication of the year 1979.
938\. Unless the authors of these various articles, which are compiled in the
said book and those persons, who were consulted by such writer, are examined
in the Court and the other party i.e. the Prosecution is given an opportunity
to test their veracity on touchstone of the cross-examination, no evidentiary
value can be attached to the collection of such articles though presented
under compilation in a book form.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 978
939\. Further on this point, the defence has also examined Sh. Manohar S.
Bhatkal as DW-17, the Printer of the book "who killed L.N. Mishra" Ex.DW-5/B.
He deposed that printing of the said book had taken place in his press. The
book was printed as per the original manuscript given by the publisher.
Popular Prakashan is the publisher of the book and Sh. Ram Dass Bhatkal is its
Managing Director. They did not retain the original manuscript and returned to
the publisher M/s Popular Book Depot (Printing Division). He has no knowledge
as to who is in possession of manuscript. He has no personal knowledge about
the articles written in the book.
940\. The defence has examined one of the writers of the articles published in
the said book "who killed L.N. Mishra" Sh. Arun Shourie as DW-16. He testified
that in the year 1979, he was the Executive Editor of Indian Express. He has
written the introduction of the book Ex.DW-5/B titled as "who killed L.N.
Mishra". Sh. B.M. Sinha, the then Chief Reporter, Indian Express in Delhi used
to report him (DW-
16) and the said book is a compilation of articles Mark B, C and D of Sh. B.M.
Sinha, who is no more. Articles E & F written by him are also reproduction of
articles published in the newspaper Indian Express from 27th May, 1979 to 30th
May, 1979. The book also contains reproduction of interviews of Sh. V.M.
Tarkunde and Sh. Karpuri Thakur, which are Mark H & G. It is elicited in his
cross- examination that Sh. B.M. Sinha gave him an account of what he had
found after meeting the concerned officers and then he cleared his CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 979 articles. He had written his own articles with more information
and a detailed study of the report of Mathew Commission. He had also discussed
the matter with Sh. Karpuri Thakur, who was the then Chief Minister of Bihar
and informed him that he had doubts about circumstances, which led to the
death of late L.N. Mishra and requested the Central Government to reopen the
investigation. He (CM Bihar) had requested Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate
to examine the evidence and give his own opinion. Sh. Karpuri Thakur told him
(DW-16) that he was pressing the Central Government to reopen the case and for
that purpose, he met officials of CBI, Home Minister and the Prime Minister.
According to Sh. Karpuri Thakur, the Prime Minister told him that an inquiry
was going on and proper procedure would be to seek an independent legal
opinion and entrusted the task to Sh. V.M. Tarkunde. He (DW-16) was close to
Sh. Tarkunde and thus he was in touch with him almost every second or third
day. He deposed that he met Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40) and Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-34)
in connection with the murder of Sh. L.N. Mishra. He further stated that the
Home Minister made a statement in the Lok Sabha on 26.03.1975 that four
persons have made confession and one of them had recorded the confession
before the Magistrate. The extract of debate held in Rajya Sabha on 27.02.1975
are Ex.DW-16/B & Ex.DW-16/C. These were exhibited subject to objections by Ld.
Special PP.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 980
941\. In his cross-examination, DW-16 testified that the book Ex.DW-5/B is
compilation of articles, which appeared in Indian Express at the relevant
time. He admitted that the manuscript of the articles published in book
Ex.DW-5/B are not available with him and might not be available with Indian
Express. He testified that whatever investigation had been done before
publishing the articles in Indian Express, was done by Indian Express of their
own and without any authority from the Central Government or State Government.
He voluntarily stated that newspapers do not seek any permission from any
authority before conducting investigations. He did not examine those persons,
whose names are mentioned in the beginning of said book. He deposed that
important investigation by the reporters used to be submitted in writing but
without their signatures. In case report was to be published, he used to
direct News Editors orally to do the needful. Sh. D. P. Ahuja (DW-34) and Sh.
S. B. Sahai (DW-40), the police officers, who initially investigated the case,
met him and had shown him their report of investigation. His publication was
based Tarkunde report, his meeting with said two police officers, their
investigation reports and his personal interaction with Sh. Tarkunde. His
articles E & F in Ex.DW-5/B are based on Tarkunde's report, his interaction
with Tarkunde. He deposed that what was stated by two police officers Sh. Ojha
& Sh. Sahai and mentioned in Mathew Commission Report Mark G, is reproduction
of articles published in Indian Express and its record would be with the
Reporter.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 981
942\. A perusal of statement of DW-16 Sh. Arun Shourie reflect that the
articles published in the book "who killed L.N. Mishra" are consisting of the
compilation given to him by Sh. B.M. Sinha, Reporter of Indian Express, who
has not been examined. Manuscript of any of the article has not been placed on
record. The articles E & F written by him are based on his interaction with
Sh. Tarkunde, and report of Sh. V.M. Tarkunde and interaction with Sh. Sahai
and Sh. Ojha. Sh. Sahai and Sh. Ojha have been examined as DW-34 and DW-40
respectively and I have already appreciated the testimony of DW-40 and
discarded his report in my judgment and opinion of Sh. Tarkunde based on
report of DW-40 is inconsequential.
943\. At best, the evidence of DW-16 Sh. Arun Shourie can be treated as "hear-
say" evidence. His versions are mere collection of statements made to him by
various persons. In the absence of such authentic sources from which these
statements have flown, the witness becomes a secondary source having no
firsthand knowledge or competence to swear to such of the facts he deposes.
Therefore, the Courts of law have been time and again, by a catena of rulings
held that 'newspaper Reports are mere "hear-say" and no evidentiary value can
be attached to such articles. In one such judgment title d as M.P. Lohia v.
State of West Bengal, 2005 AIR (SC) 790, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
that all materials that may be used in the forthcoming trial in the case and
appearance of such material in any article in the media would CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 982 certainly interfere with the administration of justice and media
should not indulge in such trial when the matter is sub judice. The relevant
Para of the judgment reads as under: -
> "9. Having gone through the records, we find one disturbing factor which we
> feel is necessary to comment upon in the interest of justice. The death of
> Chandni took place on 28th February, 2002 and the complaint in this regard

944\. Further, in another judgment titled as State of Maharashtra v. Rajendra
Jawanmal Gandhi, 1997 AIR (SC) 3986, the Hon'ble Supreme has held in Para No.
36 that there is procedure established by law governing the conduct of trial
of a person accused of an offence. A trial by press, electronic media or
public agitation is very antithesis of rule of law. It can well lead to
miscarriage of justice. A judge has to guard himself against any such pressure
and he is to be guided strictly by rules of law.
73) Findings pursuant to orders of Hon'ble SCI in W.P. 268 of 1987 (DD:
10.12.1991).
945\. I have already held that tape-recorded statement of Vikram was obtained
by the authorities, Jailor and Doctor of Danapur Jail under coercion, threat
and pressure on 30.09.1978. The Ld. Special PP pointed out that the Attorney
General of India on behalf of Central Bureau of Investigation had to file a
Transfer Petition No. 69 of 1979 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India for
transfer the case CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 984 outside the State of Bihar
preferably in Delhi and also transfer the approver Vikram, who was confined in
Danapur Sub-Jail to a Jail outside the State of Bihar, preferably in Delhi.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 17.12.1979 has transferred the case
without going into merits of the allegations leveled by CBI and State
Government against each other.
946\. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi has alleged in his W.P. No. 268 of 1987 (decided
on 10.12.1991) that he was arrested on 06.07.1975 and was not produced before
the Patna Courts in the Samastipur case till 19.12.1976 and all this while,
the CBI has been obtaining extension of his remand without producing him
before the Patna courts and without even notice to him. He has also alleged
that until he was produced in Patna courts in December 1976, he did not know
that he was also implicated in L.N. Mishra's murder case. The charge sheet was
filed only in December, 1975 and long prior thereto he had become entitled to
release under Section 167 Cr. PC. He has also alleged that even though he was
granted bail by Delhi High Court in Appeal preferred against his conviction in
the case relating to Chief Justice Ray, he was not released because of his
implication in L.N. Mishra's case and he continued to be in Jail till March
1978, when he was granted bail by the Hon'ble Supreme and his incarceration
from 21.01.1977, the date grant of bail by Delhi High Court up to 30.03.1978
is illegal and unconstitutional and it vitiates the entire proceedings.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 985 The W.P. No. 268/1987 was decided by the
Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme along with other petition titled
as Abdul Rehman Antulay and Others Versus R.S. Nayak and Another, 1992 (1) SCC
225 and in Para No. 96 of the judgment, the Constitutional Bench of the
Hon'ble Supreme court has held that it would not be proper to pronounce upon
the correctness or otherwise of the said respect in this Writ Petition and if
indeed any such illegalities have been committed, they shall be taken into
consideration by the court as and when the case comes up for final disposal.
947\. In this backdrop, I have endeavoured to peruse the entire old record of
the case including Part-XXXIII, which contains all order sheets of the case
No. 1/1975 before Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna. It is revealed that
Ranjan Dwivedi was not arrested in this case during the investigation. Even
during the course of arguments, despite asking of the court, Ranjan Dwivedi
could not p in point any document on the record to show his arrest in this
case. In fact, an application dated 22.07.1975 Ex.PW-151/O (available in
Folder R-65) was filed by the IO Sh. H.L. Ahuja before Special Judicial
Magistrate, Patna to the effect that accused Ranjan Dwivedi is an accused in
RC-11/1975 relating to an attempt made on the life of Chief Justice of India
and is in judicial custody under the order of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Delhi and this accused Ranjan Dwivedi is wanted in Samastipur case, his
custody warrant may be sent to the court of CMM, Delhi. I have CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 986 already referred the deposition of PW-132 and search witness
PW-115 and held that A-3 was arrested on 06.07.1975 in RC-11/75.
On this application itself, there is order dated 24.07.1975 passed by the Ld.
SJM, Patna "Allowed. Issue custody W/A as prayed requests the Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate to direct the production of the accused before this
court".
948\. At Page No. 46 of Folder R-65, there is a letter dated 07.08.1975 by Sh.
T.S. Oberoi, CMM, Delhi, addressed to Superintendant Jail, Central Jail,
Tihar, Delhi to the effect that a custody warrant has been received from the
court of Sh. S.N. Gupta, Special Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class Patna
regarding involvement of Ranjan Dwivedi S/o Ram Dev Dwivedi, R/o Village
Dharharwa, PS Bela, District Sitamarhi, Bihar, which may be kept on record and
copy of this letter was forwarded to the court of Sh. S.N. Gupta, Special
Judicial Magistrate, Patna with reference to his letter dated 24.07.1975 with
intimation that accused Ranjan Dwivedi at present cannot be transferred as he
is wanted by the investigating agency of CBI in RC- 11/1975.
949\. The record reveals that on filing of charge sheet on 12.11.1975, the
cognizance was taken by the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna. The court
noticed that 12 accused persons are named in column 1, who have been sent up
for trial and four accused persons namely Rudranand Avadhoot, Shankaranand
Avadhoot, Mahender Prasad CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 987 Singh and Lakhan Pain have not
been sent up for trial and hence the court discharged these four persons.
On that day i.e. 12.11.1975, an application was also filed for issuance of
production warrant against four accused persons namely Santoshanand,
Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad, since they were under
jail custody at the Central Jail, Delhi. This prayer was allowed and it was
ordered that a letter be sent to CMM, Delhi for the production of the said
four accused persons from the Central Jail at Delhi in the court of Special
JM, Patna on 24.11.1975. However, these accused persons were not produced and
accordingly on 24.11.1975, the court of Special JM, Patna noted the non
production of these four accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram
Janam Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad and it was ordered that their production
may be awaited.
950\. However, on 08.12.1975, the court of Special JM, Patna noted having
received a letter dated 20.11.1975 from CMM, Delhi that these four persons
Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad are facing
trial in RC-11/75 and they cannot be produced. On 20.01.1976, the court of
Special Magistrate, Patna again ordered for issuance of production warrant
against these four accused persons. On 14.02.1976, the court of Special
Magistrate, Patna noticed that these four accused persons were not produced.
On 16.02.1976 the court of Special Magistrate, Patna again noticed that these
four accused persons were not produced.

951\. Admittedly, in Session Case No. 9/1976 arising out of RC- 11/75 relating
to attack on the then CJI Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.N. Ray, on 28.10.1976, accused
Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ram Janam Dwivedi were convicted by the court of
Ld. Additional Sessions Judge and order of sentence was passed against them on
01.11.1976. The court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna on 18.11.1976,
again ordered for issuance of production warrants against Santoshanand,
Sudevanand and Ram Janam Dwivedi for 06.12.1976. Record further reveals that
on 20.12.1976, eight accused persons including Sudevanand Avadhoot,
Santoshanand Avadhoot and Ranjan Dwivedi were produced before Special
Magistrate, Patna and copies of Police Papers (charge sheet) were supplied to
them. The record reveals that before the Special Magistrate, Patna, bail
orders of Ranjan Dwivedi were received on 05.04.1978 and on the same day,
after acceptance of the bail bond and issuance of release of order, by CJM,
Patna, they were taken on record. Subsequent to release on bail, Ranjan
Dwivedi has also appeared in person on 07.04.1978 before Incharge, Special
JMIC, Patna. So, there is no basis in the allegation of accused Ranjan Dwivedi
that he was arrested in this case on 06.07.1975. Though the production
warrants against him were issued by the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna,
but he was not produced in this case till 20.12.1976. Obviously, his
incarceration in the present case had been only been w.e.f. 20.12.1976 till he
was released on bail on 05.04.1978, when on receiving the bail order, he was
released.

Magistrate, Patna. Cognizance was taken. The court noticed that 12 accused
persons are named in column 1, who were sent up for trial and four accused
persons namely Rudranand Avadhoot, Shankaranand Avadhoot, Mahender Prasad
Singh and Lakhan Pain have not been sent up for trial and hence the competent
court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna discharged these four persons on
that day itself. However, at the same time, an application on behalf of
prosecution was also filed for issuance of production warrant against four
accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Ram
Nagina Prasad, since they were under jail custody at the Central Jail, Delhi
in Sessions case No. 09 of 1975 relating to attack on . This prayer was
allowed and it was ordered that a letter be sent to CMM, Delhi for the
production of the said four accused persons from the Central Jail at Delhi in
the court of Special JM, Patna on 24.11.1975. As mentioned herein before,
these four accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi
and Ram Nagina Prasad were not produced before the Special Judicial Magistrate
till 20.12.1976. In fact, as per record, on 20.12.1976, all eight accused
persons including Sudevanand Avadhoot, Santoshanand Avadhoot and Ranjan
Dwivedi appeared before Special Magistrate, Patna. Copies of Police Papers
were supplied to them. On 03.01.1977, an application CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 990 was
filed on behalf of the Prosecution for summoning record & the order dated
27.10.1975 of CMM, Patna granting conditional pardon to PW-1 and PW-2. The
case was then adjourned by Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna for 17.01.1977
for recording of statement of both the approvers and directions were issued
for production of approver Vikram from Danapur Jail and summing of other
approver Visheshwaranand @ Madan Mohan Srivastava.
953\. Now, the proceedings in the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna
in this case from 17.01.1977 till the case was transferred by Special Judicial
Magistrate on 21.02.1980 on directions of the Apex Court, transferring the
case from State of Bihar to Delhi, reveal startling and shocking affairs. As
per the proceedings, the accused persons in collusion with the Jailor, Jail
Doctor and Jail Superintendant of Phulwari Sharif Jail and authorities stopped
coming to the court in order to stall completion of committal proceedings so
that the statement of approver Vikram is not recorded and in the meanwhile
they were successful in putting pressure by torture and threat on Vikram to
make a statement, which was recorded by the Jailor, without any authority and
jurisdiction in a tape. I have already discussed that the approver Vikram has
testified in the court that he was subject to torture, threat and coercion at
the hands of Jailor, Jail Doctor and Jail Superintendant and officers of CID
Bihar and he was compelled to read and speak from a prepared statement. At the
cost of repetition, Vikram had sent three letters to the CBI officers, which
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara)  Page No. 991 makes his version to be correct one and believable.
As per the record, the accused persons in collusion with Jailor, Jail Doctor
and Jail Superintendant and officers of CID Bihar had made a strategy that
between 17.01.1977 and 21.02.1980 that some of the accused would not appear
before the Special Judicial Magistrate or that if all of them appeared Vikram
would not be produced from the Danapur Jail so that statement of the approver
Vikram is not recorded. As per the record approver Vikram was produced only on
02.05.1977, 06.07.1977, 11.07.1977, 21.07.1977, 28.07.1977 and 25.07.1978 only
and on these dates all the accused were not produced from Phulwari Sharif Jail
deliberately with malafide intention on one pretext or another. During this
period, all accused persons were produced from Phulwari Sharif Jail only on
01.04.1977, 16.05.1977, 30.05.1977, 22.06.1977 and 28.08.1978 and on these
five dates approver Vikram was not escorted before the Special Judicial
Magistrate. On 17.01.1977 and on some other dates, it was reported on the
production warrants that the accused persons lying in Phulwari Sharif Jail
have expressed their inability to appear before the Special Judicial
Magistrate, Patna on the date fixed. On some of the dates, it was reported
that some of the accused persons have refused to come from the Jail to attend
the court on 28.02.1977 and 28.03.1977. On some other dates, it was reported
that particular accused or accused persons were suffering from stomach pain or
loose motions or pain in the ear without even medical certificate. The Special
Judicial Magistrate had ordered even for their CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 992 proper
check-up by the Civil Surgeon. On several dates the Special Judicial
Magistrate had directed that Jail Superintendant and Jailor shall ensure the
presence of accused persons in the court on the next date of hearing. Despite
this, the order of the Special Judicial Magistrate was not complied with and
ultimately on 05.01.1978, the Special Judicial Magistrate was constrained to
write to I.G. Prison, I.G. Police and Chief Secretary of the State of Bihar
for ensuring the presence of accused persons in the court on the next date of
hearing, so that his directions are adhered to. Record also divulges that on
31.01.1977, 28.02.1977, 28.03.1977, 02.05.1977, 06.07.1977, 11.07.1977,
21.07.1977, 28.07.1977, 11.08.1977, 25.08.1977, 06.09.1977, 20.09.1977,
04.10.1977, 17.10.1977, 18.10.1977, 01.12.1977, 14.12.1977, 05.01.1978,
18.01.1978, 15.02.1978, 01.03.1978, 03.04.1978, 01.05.1978, 29.05.1978,
15.06.1978, 29.06.1978, 11.07.1978, 22.07.1978, 25.07.1978, 17.08.1978,
11.09.1978, 16.09.1978, 25.09.1978, 17.11.1978, 01.12.1978, 15.12.1978,
15.02.1979, 01.03.1979, 16.03.1979, 24.03.1979, 07.04.1979, 21.04.1979,
19.05.1978 & 16.06.1979 that only some of the accused were produced from
Phulwari Sharif Jail as statement of approver Vikram could not be recorded in
the absence of the other accused persons. On each & every date of hearing,
accused have filed one application or many applications in order to drag the
proceedings and the work of the then Ld. Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna is
really appreciable as he has by reasoned long hand written orders CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 993 disposed off all those applications. The Ld. Special Judicial
Magistrate did not find any merit in those applications, which used to be
filed on almost each and every date of hearing. Not only before the committal
Magistrate, even during the trial the accused persons have left no stone
unturned in delaying the trial and it would be worth mentioning that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, while dismissing Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 200 of 2011
and Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 205 of 2011 filed by accused Ranjan Dwivedi and
accused Sudevanand Avadhoot on 17.08.2012 by a Division Bench of Hon'ble
Supreme Court presided by Hon'ble Mr. Justice H.L. Dattu (as his Lordship then
was and now decorating the highest office in hierarchy of Judiciary as Chief
Justice of India) that the accused persons were successful in dragging on the
proceedings to a stage, where it is drawn further it might snap the Justice
Delivery System and Para No. 25 of the Judgment reads as under: -
> "25. The learned Senior Counsel would tell us, please don't look who caused
> the delay in completing the trial but only look at whether there is a delay
> in completion of the trial and if it is there, please put a big "full stop"

We certainly say that our system has not failed, but, accused was successful
in dragging on the proceedings to a stage where, if it is drawn further, it
may snap the Justice Delivery System. We are also conscious of the fact that
more that thirty Judges had tried this case at one stage or the other, but,
all of them have taken care to see that the trial is completed at the
earliest. They are not to be blamed and certainly the system has not be
blamed, but, positively, somebody has succeeded in his or in their attempt.
The system has done its best, but, has not achieved the expected result and
certainly, will not fit into the category of cases where (late) N.A.
Palkhiwala, one of the most outstanding Senior Advocates in the Country had
said that "......the law may or may not be an ass, but in India it is
certainly a snail and our cases CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 995 proceed at a pace which
would be regarded as unduly slow in a community of snails".
Therefore, we say, we will not buy this argument of the learned Senior Counsel
that there is systemic failure. Therefore, in our view at this stage the one
and the only direction that requires to be issued is to directed the learned
trial judge to take up the case on day to day basis and conclude the
proceedings as early as possible, without granting unnecessary and unwarranted
adjournments."
954\. Earlier also, accused Ranjan Dwivedi had filed a W.P. 268 of 1987 before
the Hon'ble Supreme Court for quashing of the proceedings on the ground of
delay in trial, which was heard by the Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court headed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.N. Singh, the then Chief
Justice, along with the petition titled as Abdul Rehman Antulay & Others Vs.
R.S. Nayak & Another, reported as 1992 (1) SCC 225, and while dismissing the
petition of accused Ranjan Dwivedi on 10.12.1991, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has observed in Para No. 95 of its ruling that "It is clear from the material
placed before us that the prosecution cannot be held guilty of any delaying
tactics or for that matter, for causing any delay in the conduct of trial from
the date the criminal proceedings were transferred to Delhi. The proceedings
of the court for this period placed before us by the respondents do clearly
establish that during CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 996 this period the prosecution has
always been anxious to go on with the trial. That the trial could not be
concluded so far is for reasons for which prosecution cannot be held
responsible. ............Thus, it is clear that from 1979 onwards (when the
proceedings were transferred to Delhi court) the prosecution cannot be said to
be guilty of any delay. This much is practically beyond dispute".
955\. The Jailor, Jail Superintendant, Jail Doctor, Officers of CID Bihar
including Sh. D.P. Ojha (DW-34), Sh. K.P. Sinha and others have got recorded
the statement of the approver Vikram in a tape in Danapur Jail on 30.09.1978,
when he was compelled under torture a nd coercion to speak from a prepared
statement. I have already referred that the approver Vikram was not escorted
to Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna for completion of committal proceedings
by the Jail Authorities. Even after 30.09.1978, he was never produced before
the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna and on 21.02.1980, on the direction of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the case was transferred to CMM, Delhi. Therefore,
approver Vikram had even no opportunity to explain to the court about the
torture meted out to him in the Jail. The defence got exhibited the statement
of approver Vikram as Ex.PW-2/DF, which was recorded before the Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi on 21.04.1980, 21.04.1980, 24.04.1980 and
07.05.1980 to complete the committal proceedings and there approver Vikram got
first available opportunity to inform the court that the Home Secretary and
Law Secretary of the Bihar Government repeatedly came to Jail and CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 997 the Jailor Haider Ali and Doctor D. Ram, Superintendant of Jail
used to take him to the office, whenever these officers came there and he used
to be given beatings. He used to be frightened and intimidated and they used
to tell him that the Bihar Government did not want to prosecute this case and
wanted to withdraw it and they threatened him to kill, if he did not make a
statement according to their dictate. He further stated before the Ld. CMM
that under those circumstances he was compelled to give a statement from a
prepared one and his voice was then tape recorded.
956\. In view of this discussion mentioning the chronological events, this
court comes to the conclusion that the approver Vikram, while in custody in
Danapur Jail was subject to undue torture at the hands of Jailor, Jail Doctor,
Superintendant Jail, Officers of CID Bihar including the highest officials of
the Bihar Government the Chief Secretary, Law Secretary and Home Secretary,
and the approver Vikram was forced to read from a prepared statement under
coercion and threat to retract from his confessional statement recorded by Ld.
ACMM, Delhi under Section 164 of Cr. PC. This fact is further reflected from
his legal evidence recorded before my Learned Predecessor during trial and
corroborated by his letters written to the officers of the CBI in due course.
957\. As per the record of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna the Mother Smt.
Jhuna Devi and Brother Sh. Parmanand Singh of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 998 approver
Vikram moved application on 12.08.1977 to the effect that they wanted to meet
approver Vikram in the Jail as there was threat to his life. Subsequently,
they were allowed to meet Vikram in the Jail. He refused to meet them but the
Jailor directed him to meet them in view of the order of the court. PW-2
Vikram has testified in the court that he did not meet his mother and brother
as he saw his mother and brother accompanied by several Anand Margies.
Obviously, those Anand Margies had accompanied his mother and brother to put
pressure on Vikram to retract from his confessional statement. These facts
fortifies the version of Vikram that he was compelled to read from a prepared
statement under threat and coercion of Jailor, Jail Doctor and officers of CID
Bihar, who have used extra constitutional methods, not known to the la w. The
above observation becomes more significant to understand the version of
approver PW-2 that there had been undue pressure, threat or coercion by the
authorities as well as the vested interests not to speak the truth before the
courts and further terrorizing him by extra constitutional methods to retract
the confessional statement under Section 164 of Cr. PC. Being consternated by
such tactics on the part of the other accused and through the Jail
authorities, Jail Doctor and officers of CID, Bihar and all high dignitaries
in the State Government, in the garb of a discreet inquiry ordered by the then
Chief Minister to DW-40 Sh. S.B. Sahai, PW-2 Vikram had written certain
letters, which are part of the documentary evidence in this case. I have
already discerned by CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)  Page No. 999 dilating the above letters in the
earlier part of my judgment concerning these documentary evidence, which will
take care of the observations at Para (b) in Para No. 30 in Abdul Rehman
Antulay (supra). In fact, there was no retraction of his statement later
despite the illegal taped conversation, which I discard as unknown to law. The
special feature of the version of PW-2 in his confessional statement, followed
by the statement recorded by the committal Magistrate, who allowed the cross-
examination and the extensive, searching, disarrayed and repetitive cross-
examination during trial running into about 350 pages spread on several dates,
had been consistent, non-wavering, comprehensive, leaving no room to doubt the
same as tutored. Further, his statement is supported by the documentary
evidence of his letters also. This court also sees that PW-2 had endured many
inducements, threats, tactics, and manhandling but spoken truth. All the
efforts of other accused to win over him either by hook or crook went in vain.
75) Report of Mathew's Commission of Inquiry.
958\. During the course of arguments, the Ld. Defence Counsel Sh. Feroz Ahmed,
Advocate submitted that the Central Government has constituted one man
commission of Inquiry, headed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.K. Mathew and it should
be considered by this court. The defence has examined DW-26 Sh. Amar Chand,
Under Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs. DW-26 brought with him a copy of
Report of One Man Commission of Inquiry headed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1000 K.K. Mathew. He testified that the copy of Report is Ex.DW-26/1.
He deposed that the evidence and other material that surfaced before the said
One Man Commission of Inquiry, is not traceable despite best efforts. Even,
the file that pertains to the appointment of One Man Commission of Inquiry is
not traceable despite best efforts. He also brought authenticated copy of
Interim Report-I and Interim Report-II of Shah Commission of Inquiry
Ex.DW-26/2 and Ex.DW-26/3 respectively and final Shah Commission of Inquiry
Report is Ex.DW- 26/4. He also brought the original statement of Sh. D. Sain,
a witness recorded before Shah Commission of Inquiry which is Ex.DW-26/5.
959\. In the cross examination of DW-26, it is elicited that original report
of Mathew Commission of Inquiry is not traceable and he cannot say when the
copy of Inquiry Report Ex.DW-26/1 was printed and at whose instance.
Ex.DW-26/2 was not authenticated in his presence. He also could not say as to
when it was authenticated and whose signatures appeared at point 'A' of
Ex.DW-26/2. Ex.DW-26/3 was not authenticated in his presence at point 'A'. He
also could not say as to when it was authenticated and whose signatures
appeared at point 'A' of Ex.DW-26/3. He also could not identify the signatures
at point 'A' on the Report Ex.DW-26/4. He admitted that the statement
Ex.DW-26/5 is not signed by the deponent or Attesting Officer at running page
no.39.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1001
960\. From the testimony of DW-26 Sh. Amar Chand, it is evident that the
evidence and other material that surfaced before the One Man Commission of
Inquiry was not traceable despite best efforts. Even the file pertaining to
the appointment of One Man Commission of Inquiry was not traceable. When the
evidence and other material relied upon by the One Man Commission of Inquiry
on the basis of which the Report dated 09.05.1977 Ex.DW-26/1 has been given is
not available, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry is not per se
admissible in evidence. Furthermore, since those persons who had appeared as
witnesses before the Commission of Inquiry are not examined in this Court and
both sides i.e. Prosecution and the accused persons having been given no
opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses, no value is attached to their
statement which they have allegedly made before the Commission of Inquiry.
961\. I have also gone through the Report dated 09.05.1977 Ex.DW- 26/1 of One
Man Commission of Inquiry headed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice, K.K. Mathew to
enquire into the incident of explosion that took place on 02.01.1975 at
Samastipur Ex.DW-26/1. My scrutiny of the Report of Inquiry revealed that
accused Santoshanand Avadhoot, Sudevanand Avadhoot and Ranjan Dwivedi appeared
before the Commission and filed preliminary objections to the examination of
any of the Prosecution witnesses to ascertain the facts and circumstances of
the case on the ground that (i) they would have to face virtually two trials,
one before the Commission to defend their CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1002 reputation
against imputation of the murder and other before the trial court to maintain
their innocence so that they might escape conviction for murder and sentence
for the same; (ii) that the Commission could not arrive at any conclusion
beyond reasonable doubt by examining only the key witnesses but would have to
record all the evidence relied on by the Prosecution as well as that offered
by defence in order to find out the true facts and circumstances; (iii) that
the finding of the Commission one way or the other would embarrass the trial
court and influence its judgment; (iv) that there is every likelihood that the
accused would be prejudiced if the Commission were to find that the version of
the facts and circumstances set out in the charge-sheet are true and (v) that
the Commission would be virtually converting itself into a parallel court to
find the facts and circumstances relating to explosion on the basis of
evidence relied upon by the Prosecution for proving its case before the
criminal court. After hearing the arguments, the relevant extract of the
observations made by One Man Commission Inquiry reads as under:-
> "12. when the established criminal court is seized of the case and has to go
> into the facts and circumstances pertaining to the explosion in order to
> find the guilt or innocence of the accused, the Commission does not think it
> expedient or proper that it should also examine the same evidence for
> arriving at the finding on facts and circumstances CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
> Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1003 of

> trial court. If any inquiry has to be conducted by the Commission and a
> finding as regards the facts and circumstances relating to other explosion

"14. It is said that the object of an inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry
Act is a probe to find the truth whereas that of a criminal trial is to find
the guilt of the accused. The Commission thinks CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1004 that
the object of every criminal trial is to find the truth of the facts and
circumstances relating to the occurrence and then find the guilt or otherwise
of the accused by applying the relevant law. Truth is not self-evident and can
be reached by Court mostly through fallible media of human agency and a
criminal court by applying the more rigorous standard of proof beyond
reasonable doubt might not be satisfied about the truth of facts as easily as
a Commission conducting investigation. It is because this exacting standard of
proof that when a criminal court feels a reasonable doubt that the evidence
before it does not reveal the truth or the whole truth, the accused is
entitled to an
acquittal........................................................" "15. The
situation, when the terms of reference were framed by the Government and the
Commission was appointed, was totally different from one obtaining today. At
that time the perpetrators of the crime were not known either to the police or
to the public. There was wild speculation among the public as to the
perpetrators of the crime and it had political overtones. Now, an independent
investigating agency after a CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1005 thorough investigation that
it was the accused who were concerned in the commission of the crime and it is
on that basis that the charge-sheet has been filed before the court. Whether
the facts and circumstances stated in the charge-sheet are true is a matter to
be decided by the trial court after taking evidence. While interpreting the
terms of reference, one has to take into account the subsequent developments.
One principle which is helpful in construing the terms of reference is to ask
and answer the question viz., if the situation obtaining today were present to
the mind of the government when it framed the terms of reference, whether it
would have asked the Commission to go into the facts and circumstances
pertaining to the
explosion............................................................." "16.
It is very pertinent, nay, very significant to note that in spite of written
invitation to the public published in all important newspaper no person or
agency has come forward with any alternative theory as to how the explosion
took place and the person or person concerned in it which is either plausible
or worthy of consideration. It must also be remembered that there is no
investigating CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1006 agency under the control of the
Commission. If the theory of the prosecution before the criminal court as to
how the explosion took place is rejected by the Commission, the Commission
will not be able to find the facts and circumstances relating to the explosion
as there is no other alternative theory before it. This in effect means that
in order to find the facts and circumstances pertaining to the explosion as
required by the terms and reference the only option left to the Commission is
to the accept the version of the Prosecution before the criminal court. In
other words, if the Commission were to find that the prosecution case is not
acceptable, then there is no way of answering the terms of reference relating
to facts and circumstances."
"17. The Commission gave anxious thoughts to all the aspects of the question
but in view of the circumstances stated above, the conclusion became in
escapable that it is neither just nor expedient to enter any finding on the
facts and circumstances pertaining to the explosion."
962\. In view of this, when the evidence that surfaced before the Commission
of Inquiry brought on the record of this Court being not CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1007
traceable, the report of One Man Inquiry is not relevant for the adjudication
of the case. Furthermore, the persons who have been examined before the
Commission have not been examined in this case to enable both the sides to
cross examine those witnesses. The One Man Commission of Inquiry has also
concluded by observing that it is neither just nor expedient to enter any
finding on the facts and circumstances pertaining to the explosion. Moreover,
the original report of One Man Commission of Inquiry headed by Hon'ble Mr.
Justice K.K. Mathew has not been brought by the witnesses being not traceable
and DW-26 Sh. Amar Chand could not say as to when this copy Ex.DW-26/1 was
printed and at whose instance. The original report Ex.DW-26/1 is not available
and no one has authenticated or certified Ex.DW-26/1 to be the true printed
copy of the Commission of Inquiry. Therefore, this report is not worthy of
consideration for adjudication of the present lis as observed by his Lordship
K.K. Mathew himself.
963\. Similarly, the witness DW-26 Sh. Amar Chand has brought interim reports
Ex.DW-26/2 and Ex.DW-26/3 which are authenticated at point 'A' and DW-26
testified that he could not say as to when these were authenticated and whose
signatures appeared at point 'A' where these were authenticated. He also could
not identify the signatures at point 'A' of the report of Shah Commission
Ex.DW-26/4. He has admitted that the statement Ex.DW-26/5 is not signed either
by the deponent or the attesting officer except at running page no.39.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1008 Even at page no.39, the initials of the deponent are
not legible. Further, at the cost of repetition, the persons who appeared
before the Shah Commission of Inquiry have not been examined in this Court to
enable both the parties to cross examine them and as such, these reports are
not relevant piece of evidence for the consideration of this Court. Moreo ver,
it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in R. Venkatakrishnan Versus
Central Bureau of Investigation, (2009) 11 SCC 737, that the report of the
Commission of Inquiry is not admissible in evidence and the relevant extract
from the judgment reads as under: -
> "The Committee was not a court. It did not render any decision. It was
> merely a fact finding body. It was constituted for a limited purpose.
> Contents of the report, therefore, without formal proof, could not have been
> taken in evidence.
A Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in M.V. Rajwade v. Dr. S.M. Hassan,
[AIR 1954 Nagpur 71] following the judgment of the Privy Council In Re.
Maharaja Madhava Singh LR, [(1905) 31 IA 239], held that a Commission is a
fact finding body meant only to instruct the mind of the Government without
producing any document of a judicial nature and that findings of a CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1009 Commission of Inquiry were not as definitive as a judgment.
Similarly in Branjnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain [1955] SCR 955, this Court held
that the Commission appointed under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850,
was not a court within the meaning of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952.
[See also Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R.
Tendolkar, 1959 SCR 279, Puhupram v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1968) MPLJ 629.
Sham Kant v. State of Maharashtra, 1992(2) RCR(Criminal) 616 : [1992 Suppl.
(2) SCC 521].] Accordingly, the Janakiraman committee report was not
admissible in evidence. The report in terms of the provisions of the Evidence
Act, 1872 is not a judgment. The report may facilitate investigation but
cannot form basis of conviction and sentencing of the accused. For the said
purpose the report was wholly inadmissible in evidence."
964\. The defence has summoned DW-6 Sh. Narender Singh, Senior Court Assistant
of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India (Record Section) who has brought certified
copies of affidavits, which were filed in said Transfer Petition (Crl.) No.
69/1979 titled as "Attorney General of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1010 India Vs.
Santoshanand Avadhoot and others". The copies of affidavits are Ex.DW-6/A to
Ex.DW-6/E (available in folder R-57). The mode of proof of execution of these
documents was objected to by the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor obviously for
the reasons that these affidavits could be proved only by examining the
deponent of respective affidavits. These affidavits are of six persons, out of
which the defence has examined DW-18 Sh. Hari Kishore Shaiy, Under Secretary,
Government of Bihar to prove his affidavit Ex.DW-6/E, DW-34 Sh. D.P. Ojha, SP
Vigilance, Government of Bihar to prove his affidavit Ex.DW-6/D and DW-40 Sh.
Shashi Bhushan Sahai, the then DIG, CID Bihar to prove his affidavit
Ex.DW-6/A. As the deponents of other three affidavits have not been examined,
the same are not being considered being inadmissible in evidence. I have
already appreciated the testimony of DW-40 Sh. Shashi Bhushan Sahai and his
report. The defence has examined DW-18 Sh. Hari Kishore Shaiy, the then Under
Secretary (Home) in the Government of Bihar, in the year 1979, who testified
that he filed his affidavit Ex.DW-6/E before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India on behalf of Government of Bihar in the said Transfer Petition. There is
no specific relevant averment in his affidavit and the same is also not
referred by the Ld. Defence Counsel in their respective arguments.
965\. DW-34 Sh. D.P. Ojha, the then Superintendent of Police, Samastipur
deposed that he remained associated with the investigation in relation to the
bomb blast that took place on the Dais at the Platform CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1011
No. 3 of the Railway Station, Samastipur since its inception. Since this case
was a matter of high magnitude, the investigation in this case was taken over
by CID on the next day of incident. CBI had taken over the investigation of
this case he continued extend to his logistic support to CBI as and when asked
for. He never interrogated Arun Kumar Thakur (CW-8). He did not arrest Arun
Kumar Thakur. He was associated with CID when statement of Arun Kumar Thakur
came to be recorded under Section 164 of Cr. PC. He was not aware whether Arun
Kumar Mishra also wanted to make his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC. He
did not visit Arun Kumar Thakur and Arun Kumar Mishra in the Jail. However,
Inquiry was being conducted by Sh. S.B. Sahai (DW-40) DIG, Vigilance under the
orders of Government of India. He was associated with the said Inquiry and
visited Danapur Jail along with Sh. K.P. Singh, DSP, CID to conduct Inquiry
from the inmate there. He did not remember whether the name of inmate was
Vikram. When he was S.P. Samastipur, many Journalists used to come to him to
know the facts and progress of the case. He did not try to influence anyone.
He never met Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate or B.M. Sinha, Chief Reporter
of Indian Express, to brief them on the facts of the case. He filed an
affidavit in the Transfer Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is
Ex.DW-6/D. In Para No. 9 of his affidavit Ex.DW-6/D, he had deposed that he
never made any attempt to contact Sh. Visheshwaranand @ Madan Mohan Srivastava
for the purpose of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1012 exercising or effecting a
pressure on him to resile from his earlier statement.
966\. In his cross-examination, DW-34 Sh. D.P. Ojha testified that he was
aware that the person namely Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand
detailed in his affidavit Ex.DW-6/D became an approver during investigation of
this case by CBI. He has denied the suggestion that Arun Kumar Thakur was kept
at Dal Singh Sarai in handcuffs and given beatings or that Arun Kumar Thakur
made his statement under Section 164 Cr. PC at his instance or under his
threat and coercion. He also denied the suggestion that Arun Kumar Mishra was
arrested by him and kept at Inspection Bungalow, Dal Singh Sarai on his
instructions. He has also denied the suggestion that Jailor Rehman made Arun
Kumar Mishra read the statement written by him (DW-34) and recorded the said
statement in a tape.
967\. A scrutiny of the deposition of DW-34 reflects that he has admitted that
the approver PW-1 Madan Mohan Srivastava has his alias name Visheshwaranand.
He has mentioned this alias name of PW-1 not only in his affidavit Ex.DW-6/D
filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, but also in his deposition in this
court on 18.03.2009 at the time of cross-examination by the Ld. Special PP.
Despite this, the defence has chosen not to re-examine him and this conduct of
defence clearly reveal that they have admitted the position presented by the
prosecution that Madan Mohan Srivastava has his alias name as CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1013 Visheshwaranand. Thus, the testimony of DW-6 Sh. D.P. Ojha
fortifies the testimony of PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava that he was also
known as Visheshwaranand after taking diksha as Avadhoot. His admission that
he visited Danapur Jail along with Sh. K.P. Singh, DSP, CID fortifies the
version of PW-2 Sh. Vikram that officers of CID, Bihar used to visit and
torture him in Danapur Jail and he was made to read a prepared statement at
their instance and that of Jailor, Jail Superintendant and Jail Doctor against
CBI retracting his confessional statement.
76) Registration of FIR by CBI.
968\. I have already dealt with the issue of registration of FIR with Police
Station Kotwali, Patna with regard to the incident of attack on Madhavanand
bearing FIR No. 24/1974 Ex.PW-92/A, with regard to the carrying of explosives

cases.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1014
969\. PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja deposed that he was posted at Deputy SP, CBI at
Delhi from November 1969 to January 1980. He was associated with the
investigation of this case at Samastipur with effect from 10.01.1975. RC No. 1

was registered in Delhi in respect of bomb blast at the house of Mahadev Sahu
at Samastipur and Ex.PW-151/B is the carbon copy of FIR No. RC 2 of 1975\.
Both these FIRs Ex.PW-151/A and Ex.PW-151/B are available in Folder R-31. The
investigation of these cases was entrusted to him by Sh. N.K. Singh, SP, CBI,
New Delhi. He is acquainted with the writings and signatures of Sh. N.K. Singh
as he had seen him writing and signing. He identified the signatures of Sh.
N.K. Singh on both the FIRs Ex.PW-151/A and Ex.PW-151/B. He received both
these FIRs on 10.01.1975. He had taken up the investigation of these cases
from Deputy SP K.P. Sinha of Bihar Police, CID. He reached Samastipur on
08.01.1975 and both these cases were being investigated by Deputy SP K.P.
Sinha, who was being assisted by team of officers Sh. S.B Sahai, D IG, CID,
Sh. A.N. Trivedi, DIG, CID and Sh. D.P. Ojha, SP, Samastipur. PW-151 further
deposed that on 10.1.1975, the CBI team at Samastipur included he himself, Sh.

10.1.1975, Inspector Umesh, A. Prashad, J.R. Bagaria, R.A. Sharma and P.K.
Mishra were also associated in the investigation of these cases. After
discussion with the CID and local officers, the investigation of both these
cases RC- 1/1975 and RC-2/1975 was amalgamated on 10.1.1975 itself. On
10.1.1975, a meeting took place between the Director-cum-IG CBI and Director
General, Bihar Police Force and others and it was decided that inspite of the
transfer of investigation of the two cases to CBI, the local police and CID
would remain actively associated in the investigation of these two cases on
account of their local knowledge and he sent a formal requisition to Dy. SP
Sh. K.P. Sinha of Bihar Police CID and authorized Sh. K.P. Sinha Dy. SP and
his officers to collect intelligence and develop clues, interrogate persons

investigation of this case was entrusted to him. He identified the signatures

No. 13/1975 is now exhibited as Ex.PW-151/A-2.
77) Arrest of Santoshanand.
970\. It is argued by the Ld. Counsel for accused Santoshanand that the
accused was not arrested in the present case but only in RC- 11/1975. I have
seen the complete old record, which speaks otherwise. In case No. 24/1974 of
PS Kotwali Patna, on 09.05.1975, the Ld. CJM, Patna on filing of an
application by the IO that there was valuable evidence against Santoshanand
Avadhoot, Arteshanand Avadhoot and Sudevanand Avadhoot, ordered for issuance
of Non- Bailable Warrants against them. (Available in Folder R-9). As per the
record, accused Santoshanand was arrested on 17.06.1975 at Patna Railway
Station in this case. IO PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja filed an application on
18.06.1975, which is Ex.PW-151/L (available in R-65) CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1017 before
Special Magistrate, Patna for police remand of accused Santoshanand and as per
the order sheet of Special Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Patna, the accused
Santoshanand Avadhoot @ Ghanshyam @ Jitender Kumar Singh, S/o Narendra Narain
Verma, R/o; Village Pursauni Kisu, Post Office Pipra, District Champran, was
produced under custody BAPARDA and prayer of the IO for his remand for 15 days
was allowed. As per the record of case No. 24/1974 PS Kotwali Patna,
(available in Folder R-9), Santoshanand himself filed an application on
03.07.1975 before the Ld. CJM, Patna that he is in custody of Police Remand in
connection with RC No. 1/75. This is reflected in the order sheet dated
03.07.1975.
971\. The record further reveal (in Folder R-65) that Sh. T.S. Oberoi, Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi sent a letter to Special Judicial Magistrate,
CBI, Patna dated 01.07.1975 to the effect that accused Santoshanand was
produced before him in RC-11/1975 and he was informed that the court of
Special Judicial Patna has remanded him for 14 days in RC-1/1975 and was
required to be produced on 02.07.1975 and since this accused Santoshanand has
been remanded in police custody by CMM, Delhi, IO of the case would not be
producing him before the court at Patna. Thereafter, Santoshanand remained in
the judicial custody in RC-11/1975. The record reveals that on filing of
charge sheet on 12.11.1975, the cognizance was taken by the Special Judicial
Magistrate, Patna. The court noticed that 12 accused persons are named in
column 1, who have been sent up for trial and four CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1018
accused persons namely Rudranand Avadhoot, Shankaranand Avadhoot, Mahender
Prasad Singh and Lakhan Pain have not been sent up for trial and hence the
court discharged these four persons. On that day i.e. 12.11.1975, an
application was also filed for issuance of production warrant against four
accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Ram
Nagina Prasad, since they were under jail custody at the Central Jail, Delhi.
This prayer was allowed and it was ordered that a letter be sent to CMM, Delhi
for the production of the said four accused persons from the Central Jail at
Delhi in the court of Special JM, Patna on 24.11.1975. However, these accused
persons were not produced and accordingly on 24.11.1975, the court of Special
JM, Patna noted the non production of these four accused persons namely
Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad and it was
ordered that their production may be awaited. However, on 08.12.1975, the
court of Special JM, Patna noted having received a letter dated 20.11.1975
from CMM, Delhi that these four persons Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram Janam
Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad are facing trial in RC-11/75 and they cannot be
produced. On 20.01.1976, the court of Special Magistrate, Patna again ordered
for issuance of production warrant against these four accused persons. On
14.02.1976, the court of Special Magistrate, Patna noticed that these four
accused persons were not produced. On 16.02.1976 the court of Special
Magistrate, Patna again noticed that these four accused CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1019
persons were not produced. He was produced before the Special Judicial
Magistrate, Patna in RC-1/1975 only on 20.12.1976 pursuant to the production
warrants admittedly after his conviction in A.N. Ray's case.
972\. PW-103 Sh. I.P. Sharma, Inspector CBI deposed that on 17.6.1975, he was
at Patna in connection with the investigation RC- 1/75-CIA-1. On that day, at
about 9.30 or 9.45 PM, an information was received that one accused of the
case RC-1/75 was available at the Railway Station, Patna. He along with Dy. SP

Punjab Mail was to arrive at Railway Station, Patna, which was to leave for
Howrah. This train was late by about half an hour on that day and before
arrival of Punjab Mail, he came to know from his source that the accused was
sitting on one bench at Platform no. 1. They then saw Platform No.1 and his

3806 of his deposition, he admitted the suggestion of the defence that after
his arrest at Railway Station, Patna, Santoshanand was produced before him and
next day his police remand for 14 days was obtained.
978\. It is found that the accused Santoshanand has not shattered the
deposition of PW-103 that he was not arrested from Railway Station, Patna. He
has only given the suggestion that the said books were not recovered from him
and he was in saffron attire and sporting beard and moustaches and long hair
with a turban. He has not discredited the testimony of PW-103 about recovery
of pants and shirts from his jhola. He has not suggested to the witness as to
what enmity he had with him or that why would he plant the recovery upon him.
Moreover, the copy of the railway ticket Ex.P-20 reflects that it was
purchased to go from Patna to Howrah and its recovery from the CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1026 person of the accused Santoshanand is not derided in the cross-
examination of PW-103. A perusal of copy of the Search Memo Ex.PW-38/A also
reflects that various articles apart from currency notes of more than
Rs.3921/-, coins of Rs.2.38, Railway Ticket, Goggle, fountain pen, a bus
ticket, a hearing aid instrument with battery in a small casket, one green
pant, one check pant, three shirts, one Ganji (Baniyan), one exercise book
were recovered in the presence of Sh. Suresh Prashad (PW-38) and Dev Kumar
Singh and search memo is prepared by Sh. I.P. Sharma (PW-103) and also signed
by Sh. P.N. Shukla (PW-133). A perusal of the testimony of PW-38 and PW-133
reflects that the accused persons including Santoshanand has not shattered
their deposition that Santoshanand was arrested from the platform of Railway
Station, Patna and that he was not sporting moustaches and beard and long hair
and was in the attire of a common person wearing pant and shirt. The record
reveal that on 20.12.1976, accused Santoshanand filed an application before
Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna that the articles, which were seized by CBI
on 17.06.1975 at Patna at the time of his arrest may be delivered to him and
on 03.01.1977, Ld. Special Judicial Magistrate has allowed that application.
In that application also, the accused Santoshanand has no where pleaded that
all the articles mentioned in the seizure memo were not recovered from him.
Here it is relevant to mention that in his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC,
accused Santoshanand answered the questions No. 228 and denied having been
arrested on 17.06.1975 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1027 on Platform No. 1 of the Railway
Station and he claimed that he was arrested from his office. He further
claimed that he was paraded after his arrest from his office at Railway
Platform and before that he was taken to CBI Office, where his form and
appearance was changed and he was not carrying anything at that time. While
replying question No. 231, he stated that excepting the cash amount, the other
articles are shown to be fake recovery and this cash was also taken from his
office. Again while replying question No. 232 to the effect that he was
carrying pant, shirt, books, exercise books and preparation of seizure memo,
he stated that all these items were planted and whatever belongs to him, he
got them back after obtaining permission from the court. A perusal of the
application dated 20.12.1976 (available in Folder R-68, at Sr. No. 67)
reflects that the accused Santoshanand had claimed back 11 items including the
cash of Rs.3923.38, fountain pain, wrist watch, goggles, book about Jai
Prakash Narayan etc. From this discussion, this court comes to the conclusion
that the accused Santoshanand was arrested at Railway Station, Patna by the
CBI officers and his search was taken in the presence of witnesses including
PW-38 and the correct seizure memo Ex.PW-38/A was prepared in which there is
mention of recovery of cash amount of Rs.3928.38, two pants, three shirts,
exercise book, hearing aid with battery. When accused Santoshanand was
arrested on 17.06.1975 at the Railway Station, Patna, he was not in saffron
attire of Avadhoot and was wearing pant and shirt. Not only that, he was also
carrying CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1028 two pants and three shirts in his jhola. He was
not sporting beard and moustaches and long hair. This further proves the
testimony of PW-1, PW-2, PW-5, PW-6, PW-11, PW-13, PW-33 and PW-68 that the
accused Santoshanand has discarded the saffron attire of Avadhoot and got cut
his moustaches and long hair and beard shaved after formation of a
Revolutionary Group.
78) Arrest of Gopalji.
979\. The Ld. Defence Counsel Ms. Sima Gulati and Sh. Anuj Kumar, Advocates
submitted that accused Gopalji was arrested only in case No. 24/1974
pertaining to attack on Madhavanand on 17.05.1975. I have already dealt with
this issue that he was arrested on 17.05.1975 from his house at Chautham after
completing the search proceedings. As per the order sheet of the case No.
24/1974 PS Kotwali Patna (available in Folder R-9), on application of the
Investigation Officer, accused Gopalji was remanded to police custody for 15
days and was to be produced on 02.06.1975. It is vehemently argued by them
that he was never arrested in RC-1/1975 relating to the incident of Samastipur
Railway Station. However, the record reveals otherwise. As per the order sheet
dated 02.06.1975 of the Ld. CJM, Patna in the case No. 24/1974 (available in
Folder R-9), on filing of application by DSP, CBI that accused Gopalji @
Krishan Mohan Singh is also wanted in RC No. 1/1975 relating to murder of Late
L.N. Mishra and others, the court ordered that accused Gopalji @ Krishan Mohan
Singh be forwarded to the court of Special Magistrate, Patna. The CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1029 record of the file of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna,
pertaining to the case No. 1 of 1975, GRPS Samastipur (File No. Part-33), it
is revealed that on filing an application Ex.PW-151/K by the IO on 02.06.1975
(available in Folder R-65), Special Magistrate allowed police remand of
accused Gopalji @ Krishna Mohan Singh, R/o Chautham for ten days from that day
in case No. 1/1975, PS Samastipur GRP relating to deep rooted conspiracy to
kill L.N. Mishra. On 12.06.1975, he was produced before the court and his
remand on application by Sh. H.L. Ahuja of the even date, was extended till
16.06.1975. On 16.06.1975, accused Gopalji was sent to jail custody. On
18.09.1975, accused Gopalji was granted bail by the Special JM under Section
167 (2) (a) of Cr. PC, subject to furnishing bail bond of Rs.3000/- with two
sureties of the like amount. On 12.11.1975, the court of Special JM, Patna has
ordered for issuance of the production warrant against Gopalji @ Krishna Mohan
Singh to the Superintendant Jail, Phulwari Sharif. On 08.12.1975 and
20.01.1975, Gopalji was produced in the court. On 18.12.1976, the court again
ordered for production of Gopalji on 20.12.1976. On 23.02.1976, an application
was filed by Gopalji from Jail asking for copy of charge sheet. On 02.06.1976,
accused Gopalji filed an application to supply him copy of the statement of
PW-1. On 18.06.1976 and 30.07.1976, the court of Special Magistrate noticed
that Gopalji has not been produced. On 13.08.1976, the court of Special
Magistrate, Patna again noticed that Gopalji has not been produced. On
08.04.1977, the bail CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1030 granted to accused Gopalji under
Section 167 (2) (a) Cr. PC was cancelled by Special Magistrate.
79) Arrest of Sudevanand.
980\. In case No. 24/1974 of PS Kotwali Patna, on 09.05.1975, the Ld. CJM,
Patna on filing of an application by the IO that there was valuable evidence
against Santoshanand Avadhoot, Arteshanand Avadhoot and Sudevanand Avadhoot,
ordered for issuance of Non- Bailable Warrants against them. (Available in
Folder R-9).
981\. The approver PW 2 Vikram @ Jaldhar Dass deposed that he was arrested
along with accused Sudevanand on 24.7.1975 at Bhagalpur. In his further cross-
examination, PW-2 deposed that Sudevanand met him at Bhagalpur on the date of
their arrest and at that time, he was already present there. He reached
Bhagalpur same day or one day before his arrest. He deposed that Sudevanand
came on 24.07.1975 by train and he (PW-2) received him at the Railway Station.
He has denied the suggestion that he and Sudevanand came together from Chakia
to Bhagalpur. He voluntarily stated that they came separately from each other.
In his further cross-examination, the Ld. Defence Counsel has given suggestion
at Page No. 326 and 327 admitting that PW-2 and Sudevanand were knowing each
other and the relevant portion of the deposition reads as under: -
> "Q. Is it or not that the train coming from Patna to Bhagalpur on 24th July
> 1975 was late?
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara) Page No. 1031 Ans. I do not remember.
> It is however, correct that Sudevanand was to come to Bhagalpur by that
> train. But I cannot say if he was to come from Patna.
> It is correct that I had prior intimation that Sudevanand was coming. It is
> also correct that I had information as to by which train he was coming.
                        Q.           Did the train come there in time?
                        Ans. I do not remember.
> I did meet Sudevanand at the railway station."
This deposition has not been shattered in the cross-examination by the accused
persons including Sudevanand. Rather, it has been admitted in the cross-
examination of PW-2 by the defence that accused Sudevanand and Vikram were
known to each other prior to their arrest on 24.07.1975.
982\. As per the order sheet dated 25.07.1975 of case No. 24/1974 PS Kotwali
Patna (available in Folder R-9), a requisition was received from DSP, Patna
for issuance of production warrant against Sudevanand Avadhoot who was in
custody at Bhagalpur Jail and accordingly production warrants were issued for
01.08.1975.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1032
983\. However, on 01.08.1975, a copy of order was received by CJM, Patna from
CMM, Delhi in RC No. 11/1975. Thereafter, accused was forwarded by CMM, Delhi
in case No. 24/1974 to the court of CJM, Patna on 08.09.1975 and he was sent
to Judicial Custody. On 15.11.1975, an application dated 12.11.1975 (available
in Folder R-
18) was moved by Sh. H.L. Ahuja, DSP stating therein that they have filed the
charge sheet in this case No. 24/1974, RC No. 1/1975 and Bhagalpur case before
the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna and during investigation local police
i.e. CID Bihar had arrested accused persons mentioned in the enclosed list (27
persons), who were subsequently released on bail and no evidence has been
found against them and they might be discharged in Patna Kotwali case No.
24/1974. Ld. CJM, Patna vide order dated 15.11.1975 discharged the said 27
accused persons from this case. Ld. CJM also ordered for sending of the record
to the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna. (The order of Ld. SJM,
Patna dated 15.11.1975 is available in Folder R-9).
984\. As per the order sheet dated 08.10.1975 of Special Judicial Magistrate,
Patna, a petition dated 03.09.1975 praying for issuance of judicial custody
warrant in respect of accused Sudevanand @ Misri Lal Yadav and Vikram @ Subir
@ Jaldhar Dass was filed. It was prayed that custody warrant be issued to CMM,
Delhi as they are lodged in Central Jail, Delhi under the order of CMM, Delhi
in RC- 11/1975 relating to the attempt to murder Hon'ble A.N. Ray, Chief CBI
Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1033 Justice of Supreme Court of India. However, the court
of Special Judicial Magistrate ordered that he cannot issue such production
warrant to a sister or superior court and as and when the trial against them
is over, Jail Authorities be intimated to produce the accused persons in his
court. He also ordered for issuance of direction to the Jail Authorities in
case RC-11/1975 and also a letter to CMM, Delhi.
985\. On 12.11.1975, an application was also filed for issuance of production
warrant against four accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ram
Janam Dwivedi and Ram Nagina Prasad, since they were under jail custody at the
Central Jail, Delhi. This prayer was allowed and it was ordered that a letter
be sent to CMM, Delhi for the production of the said four accused persons from
the Central Jail at Delhi in the court of Special JM, Patna on 24.11.1975. The
said four accused persons including Sudevanand were finally produced before
the Special Judicial Magistrate, Patna in RC-1/1975 only on 20.12.1976
pursuant to the production warrants admittedly after his conviction in A.N.
Ray's case.
986\. Investigation Officer PW-151 Sh. H.L. Ahuja deposed in his cross-
examination on behalf of accused Sudevanand at Page No. 3806 that Sudevanand
was arrested at Bhagalpur along with Vikram and from there he was brought to
Delhi and taken on police remand in the case relating to attack on life of
Chief Justice Ray. Application in other cases was moved towards the end of
July 1975. In this regard, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1034 PW-120 Sh. Umesh Deputy SP,
stated at Page No. 2529 that on 27.07.1975, he escorted Sudevanand and Vikram
from Bhagalpur and reached Delhi on 28.07.1975 and they were produced before
the CMM, Delhi.
80) Appreciation of other DWs.
987\. The accused persons have examined DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot so as
to demolish the Prosecution theory that Anand Marg had no wings like Proutist
Block of India, its Revolutionary Group, the publication wing with its
printing presses at Delhi and Jaipur, PFI (Proutist Forum of India), SDM (Sewa
Dharam Mission etc.) vehemently spoken to and proved through the Prosecution
witnesses PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand @ Vijay, PW-2 Sh.
Vikram @ Jaldhar Dass @ Subir, PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar, PW-33 Ujjawal
Prakash, which is discussed earlier and further to support the explanation
offered by accused Ram Dwivedi with regard to word "SS" scribbled by him in
his diary appeared as evidence against him.
988\. DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot on oath deposed that "SS" stands for
Sectorial Secretary. In his examination in chief he elaborated that there were
RS (Regional Secretary), DS (Diocese Secretary), DTS (District Level
Secretary), BS (Block Level Secretary) PS (Panchayat Secretary) and VS
(Village Secretary) in the organization as propounded by the founder. It is
noteworthy that DW-
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1035 1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot did not name the person
who held the alleged post as "SS". According to him "SS" is the next to the
General Secretary and third in the order of succession; founder being the head
and the General Secretary would be next to him. The organization is divided
globally into nine sectors and Sectorial Secretary is head of one such sector.
989\. Except the oral testimony, this defence witness has not produced the
constitution and bye-laws of Anand Marg to substantiate and supplant his
ocular testimony; he produced three volumes of code of conduct titled as
"Ananda Marga Caryacarya" (Ex.DW-1/1 to Ex.DW-1/3) but conveniently did not
produce the constitution and bye-laws of the cult Anand Marg; this suppression
and concealment and withholding of constitution or bye-laws by DW-1 does not
come to persuade this court to draw any other inference with regard to "SS"
found in the diary of the accused Ranjan Dwivedi Ex.PW-43/Z-6 (Q- 15 & Q-15-A)
and Ex.PW-43/Z-5 (Q-14 & Q-14-A) than to conclude that the accused Ranjan
Dwivedi as having referred to accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand by writing
"SS" in his said diary.
990\. DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot admitted that he took Sanyas in the
year 1962 after joining Anand Marg in 1961 and Sh. Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @
Anand Murti @ Baba as its founder.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1036
991\. DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot testified that there is no
revolutionary wing but he admitted that the founder of the cult propounded an
economic theory 'Prout'. He also admitted knowing Advocate Deen Pal Rai DW-24.
However, Deen Pal Rai while being examined by the defence as DW-24 deposed
that he did not know Rudranand (DW-1). He also admits having known
Madhavanand, who later parted with the organization. He concedes with regard
to arrest of the cult founder in the year 1971 in a murder case and remained
in jail for seven years. He also admitted filing of bail applications of Baba
in several courts. In his further examination in chief, he advocates that
organization does not believe in violence, it did not have enmity with
Madhavanand. However, in his cross- examination, it is elicited that
Madhavanand became an Approver against their cult Head Baba and for this
reason, their organization was not happy with him. He has shown his
unawareness if Vinayanand attacked on Madhavanand on 07.01.1974. He admitted
that he himself was arrested in attempt to murder Madhavanand by CBI.
992\. It is seen from his cross-examination that he knew all the accused
persons including Arteshanand (since deceased) and also Shankaranand (DW-2)
and Paras Nath (PW-27). In his cross- examination he also admitted that there
were self-immolations not only in India but also in Germany, USA, Sweden,
Philippines. He knew Vinayanand but he could not identify the photo of
Vinayanand CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014.
D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1037 Ex.P-3. He admitted knowing Ram Kumar
(Proclaimed Offender) living in Trimohan but conveniently deposed that he had
no intimacy with him. He further admitted that Sh. Lalit Narain Mishra was
influential in the Central Government.
993\. Initially, he denied there was any Rally organized to get Baba released
from jail. Then, he stated that Rallies were organized in Delhi, Calcutta &
Patna on different dates. Further, he twisted and deposed that no gherao or
demonstrations were held to pressurize the Government to release Baba from
jail. Again, he said that he was unaware of a Rally organized in 1973 at Boat
Club, New Delhi or that Ranjan Dwivedi gave Court arrest.
994\. In the above backdrop, one could conclusively say with common prudence
that (i) DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot, the senior most monk being
associated with founder and organization ever since 1961, is the proponent and
committed to the cause of Anand Marg. He had long association with the accused
persons. He himself was arrested by CBI as a suspect on attack on Madhavanand.
Thus, it is quite but natural for him to speak such of the half-truths only
lest the guilt of the confident associates face peril in serious accusation
like this, which they adverted for the sake of their revered Guru. He knew all
the accused persons since 1960 and he has ill-will against Prosecution for
their arrest. Thus, DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot is a partisan, interested
and biased witness. The deposition CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1038 of this partisan
witness to demolish the objective of its mis- adventures, the formation of
Revolutionary Group, to achieve unlawful goal, the conspiracy which are
overwhelmingly seen and proved through the corroborated testimony as discussed
earlier, outweighs the defence theory. In view of the above, no value can be
attached to the oral testimony of DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot. The
documentary evidence produced through this witness does not go to suggest the
innocence of the accused persons at all.
995\. Accused persons have also examined DW-2 Sh. Shankaranand, who claimed
himself to be Dharam Parchar Secretary to counter the Prosecution case that
Anand Marg had no wing of Progressive Federation of India, no organ as VSS
(Voluntary Social Service) or (Vishwa Shanti Sewa), no wing of Proutist Block
of India regarding which Prosecution has examined PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan
Srivastava @ Visheshwaranand, PW-2 Sh. Vikram @ Jaldhar Dass @ Subir, PW-33
Sh. Ujjawal Prakash and PW-68 Sh. Sudhir Kumar Basedar and further to supplant
the explanation given by accused Ranjan Dwivedi with regard to the word "SS"
scribbled by him in his diary as evidence against him having made reference to
accused Santoshanand and accused Sudevanand. He has also been examined by the
accused persons that there was another Visheshwaranand who was having his
alias name as Hanslal and wanted in this case and that PW-1 Sh. Madan Mohan
Srivastava is an imposter and not a real Visheshwaranand.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1039
996\. In his statement DW-2 claimed himself to be Dharam Parchar Secretary in
Anand Marg and joined this organisation in 1959 and informed about the
structure of Anand Marg and that its in hierarchy, there are Aacharya (Pirodha
Pramakh) President as (General Secretary), SS (Sectorial Secretary), RS
(Regional Secretary), DS (Diocese Secretary), DTS (Distt. Secretary), BS
(Block Secretary), PS (Panchayat Secretary) and VS (Village Secretary).
However, like DW-1 Aacharya Rudranand, he has also failed to mention the name
of person who held the alleged post as SS (Sectorial Secretary). Except this
oral testimony, this witness has also not produced the Constitution or bye-
laws of the Anand Marg in support of his testimony. The suppression of the
Constitution or bye-laws by DW-2 Sh. Shankaranand, this Court is unable to
deduce anything other than conclusion with regard to "SS" as mentioned in the
diary of accused Ranjan Dwivedi Ex.PW-43/Z-6 (Q-15 & Q-15-A) and Ex.PW-43/Z-5
(Q-14 & Q-14 A) that Ranjan Dwivedi as having referred to Santoshanand and
Sudevanand as "SS" in his said Diaries.
997\. DW-2 Sh. Shankaranand has deposed that Baba Anand Murti was arrested in
the year 1970 on murder charge and released by the order of the Hon'ble Patna
High Court in August, 1978. He himself was arrested four years after the
arrest of Baba (i.e. in the year 1974) and released after lifting of the
Emergency.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1040
998\. DW-2 Sh. Shankaranand has been claiming himself to be Dharam Parchar
Secretary and joined Anand Marg in 1959. He knew accused persons facing the
trial and recognized them. He also knew Ram Aasrey (Proclaimed offender) but
he has suppressed the fact by showing his unawareness if bail application of
Anand Murti was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court or that a rally was
organized at Boat Club, New Delhi in February 1973 as a mark of protest for
non-release of Baba or that accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Ranjan
Dwivedi gave their Court arrest in the Rally. He could not dare to deny all
these important events though he claimed to have been holding position of a
Secretary and joined organisation in 1959.
999\. This witness is not dependable since this witness claims on the one hand
to be the Parcharak (Propagator) of Anand Marg, knowing Visheshwaranand with a
cut mark on his nostril and on the other hand, is unaware of the status and
role of that Visheshwaranand in the Organization and further unaware of their
Guru having been denied bail and the subsequent protests. DW-2 also could not
tell about the post of Dharam Parcharak Secretary as it does not find anywhere
in the hierarchy of Anand Marg stated by him.
1000\. He himself claimed to have been arrested by CBI as a suspect for attack
on Madhavanand and he knew and recognized all the accused persons. He is one
of the oldest associate and follower of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1041 Anand Marg and
its cult since 1959, it is only and exclusively for this reason, he has
deposed in the Court to help the accused persons.
1001\. In view of the above said discussion, this Court comes to the
conclusion that DW-2 has been a closed friend/associate of the accused persons
and all of them were known to him. Hence, he is also a partisan, interested
and biased witness and his testimony does not inspire any confidence.
1002\. The defence has examined DW-3 Aacharya Keshavanand again to demolish
the case of the Prosecution that a Rally was organized in April 1973 at Boat
Club, New Delhi to pressurize the Government to release their cult head Sh.
Anand Murti and to substantiate the explanation offered by accused Ranjan
Dwivedi with regard to the words "SS" scribbled by him in his diary
Ex.PW-43/Z-6 (Q-15 & Q-15-A) and Ex.PW-43/Z-5 (Q-14 & Q-14-A) which indicates
that he met accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand in the bus from Muzaffarpur to
Samastipur on 01.01.1975.
1003\. DW-3 Aacharya Keshavanand as per his examination-in-chief joined the
Anand Marg in the year 1962 and became an Avadhoot in 1967\. He testified
about the hierarchy of Anand Marg in which at the top there is Pirodha
Pramukh, the President and thereafter General Secretary followed by SS
(Sectorial Secretary). It also appeared in his statement that Anand Marg is a
registered body in District Puruliya CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1042 (West Bengal) and
they have their constitution by the name "Anand Marg Parcharak Sangh". He
remained Regional Secretary of Anand Marg in the year 1968 in Bombay region
and in the year 1969-70 for Bangalore region. He joined as General Secretary
in the year 1973. He deposed to have been arrested in January 1974 for attack
on Madhavanand, a defector along with 27 persons. He was released on bail in
June 1974. He was again arrested under MISA on 14.01.1975 and released after
lifting of emergency. It has also come in his further deposition that Baba was
arrested on 29.12.1971 in defector's murder case and was not released on bail
but was acquitted in August, 1978. At that time, he was Acting General
Secretary. He claimed that Baba was poisoned on 12.02.1973 as narrated to him
by PA of Baba namely Ramanand (DW-7). He knew accused Santoshanand since
1968-69 and accused Sudevanand since 1968. In the year 1972, Santoshanand was
Incharge of 'Prout' newspaper which was published from Delhi. They had the
records of memberships, designations, Avadhoot and their postings and
transfers but it was destroyed/ransacked by the CBI. In his cross-examination,
DW-3 admitted that there were self- immolations by their two Avadhoots in
Germany, one in USA and Philippines each and three in India. They have self-
immolated not only to ask for release of Baba but also to institute an inquiry
about poisoning of Baba in jail. He testified that Rally held at Boat Club,
New Delhi in 1973 was not for pressurizing the Government to release Baba but
to highlight the poisoning incident of Babaji and to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1043
constitute a judicial inquiry. He admitted that accused persons facing the
trial are known to him.
1004\. Despite the fact that Anand Marg is a registered body and has its
constitution, this witness has also suppressed the material fact of bringing
on record the constitution and bye-laws to show the structure and hierarchy of
Anand Marg organization as to whether there was any post of Sectorial
Secretary. He did not disclose the name who was the Sectorial Secretary in the
year 1974-75. If Baba was poisoned, they are supposed to have lodged complaint
with the Jail Authorities, concerned Court and Police Authorities but he
neither lodged any complaint nor filed any such copy. He himself admitted that
he was arrested in January 1974 in a case relating to attack on Madhavanand
and released on bail in June 1974. Accused persons are known to him being the
active member of Anand Marg. He has been associated with the Anand Murti, the
founder of their cult since joining Anand Marg in 1962 and for him also it is
quite natural but to make the statement suitable and favourable to the accused
persons and thus he is also interested, partisan and biased witness and no
value can be attached to the deposition of such witness.
1005\. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi has examined DW-1, DW-2 and DW-3 to prove the
hierarchy in the Anand Marg Organisation so as to dispel the case of the
prosecution that scribblings in his diary the alphabets used by him as "SS"
stands for Santoshanand and CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1044 Sudevanand, but they failed
to file the Constitution or the bye-laws of the organisation. DW-2 himself
claimed to be Dharam Parchar Secretary, which does not find anywhere in the
hierarchy of the Anand Marg. Accused Ranjan Dwivedi has claimed in his
statement under Section 313 Cr. PC that Ram Tanuk Singh was the Legal
Secretary, which also does not find in the hierarchy of Anand Marg
Organisation. PW-2 has claimed that he reported to the Chief Secretary Sh.
Dhaneshanand at D-41, South Extension-I, New Delhi. PW-1 has also deposed that
he himself was Provincial Secretary. PW-1 has also named Sh. Vishokanand as
Chief Secretary of the Organization and Sh. Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal as
Organizing Secretary at Bhopal. DW-37 has claimed himself to be the Office
Secretary of the Anand Marg. PW-68 claimed that he was previously Chief
Training Secretary and then Area Secretary, Bombay, Finance Secretary in Delhi
and also as Press and Paper Secretary. In his cross-examination, there is a
reference of one Puniyanand as Chief Secretary. However, in the cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses, the accused persons including Ranjan
Dwivedi never put his case that there was a post of Sectorial Secretary in the
organisation or that there was no post of Chief Secretary, Finance Secretary,
Press and Paper Secretary, Office Secretary. Admittedly, the word "Sectorial"
is not found in any dictionary even on the internet. Admittedly, it is also
not a coined word. The post of Sectorial Secretary is also never heard in the
common parlance. Therefore, the defence raised by accused Ranjan CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1045 Dwivedi that in his diary the scribblings "SS" stands for
Sectorial Secretary does not hold water.
1006\. The defence has examined DW-7 Aacharya Ramananda, an Avadhoot Anand
Margi since 1962, on the point that their cult head was poisoned in Delhi on
12.02.1973. He joined Anand Marg in 1962 and became an Avadhoot in the year
1965 when diksha was given to him by Anand Murti. He was posted as Personal
Secretary of their cult head, Anand Murti, on 01.10.1971. Sh. Anand Murti was
arrested on 29.12.1971 and released on 2nd August 1978. He deposed that while
in jail, Baba was given inhuman treatment. The atmosphere was uncongenial. On
12.02.1973, Baba was poisoned while in jail and he came to know the next day
when he went to meet Baba. He met General Secretary of their cult, many Anand
Margies and went abroad. He met many political leaders and requested them to
pressurize the government for a judicial inquiry and to ensure that no torture
is inflicted on Baba and other Anand Margies in jail. He went to UN Building
at New York and London and met Under Secretary of United Nations. He knows all
the accused persons facing the trial. He had seen accused Ranjan Dwivedi
meeting Baba for legal consultations. He knew accused Santoshanand and accused
Sudevanand ever since 1966-67.
1007\. In his cross-examination, DW-7 replied that he used to go to meet Baba
every day in the Morning. He did not lodge any complaint CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1046
about inhuman treatment meted out to Baba. He voluntarily stated that
organization made a complaint and he asked the General Secretary to do so. He
did not meet the Jailor to inform about the condition of Baba and he called
the Jail Doctor who came on his asking. Doctor informed him that a tablet was
administered to Baba on 12.2.1973 at about 11.00 PM. He remained with Baba on
13.2.1973 for about half an hour. He admitted that Sudevanand, Santoshanand
and Gopalji have been active members of Anand Marg since long and Ranjan
Dwivedi has been a member since 1974. The persons, who committed self-
immolations, were near and dear to Baba. They were all the Avadhoots. He has
denied the suggestion that false information was spread by senior members of
Anand Marg to instigate fellow members of Anand Marg against the government to
put pressure for release of Baba from Jail.
1008\. Neither DW-7, who claimed to be the Personal Secretary of Baba nor DW-3
Aacharya Keshavanand Avadhoot, who claimed to be General Secretary of Anand
Marg, filed any copy of complaint. DW- 7 admitted that no complaint was lodged
by them with any authority for meeting out alleged inhuman treatment to
Babaji. DW-7 is attached to Anand Marg since 1962 and remained even Personal
Secretary to Baba, their cult head. He knew all the accused persons and out of
them accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand and Gopalji have been active members of
Anand Marg since long and accused Ranjan Dwivedi only from 1974 and it is
quite but natural for him to speak to CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1047 dispel the theory
of prosecution that the rallies were organized in Delhi and Patna in April
1973 to pressurize the government to release Baba which has already been
proved by the statement of PW-1, PW-2, PW-11, PW-13, PW-50, PW-68 PW-122 and
admitted by accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement under Section 313 Cr. PC.
After careful appreciation, the accidence of his deposition is that, a) he
admits cult head of Anand Marg was arrested; b) there was resentment in cult
over arrest and treatment of Baba at jail; c) all four accused were acquainted
to him; d) he does not have any firsthand knowledge regarding the overtures of
a group of cult and their activities in securing the release of Baba except
the misadventure of some cult members in self-immolations and demonstrations;
e) being a confident of cult head he deposed partially the facts; f) his
testimony does not go to uproot the acts of accused in laying conspiracy and
the acts followed, which are spoken by prosecution witnesses. As a result, the
testimony of DW-7 does not help the accused persons.
1009\. In their defence, accused Ranjan Dwivedi has examined his brother-in-
law i.e. husband of his sister Sh. Rajeshwar Chaubey as DW-4 in order to
support his explanation with respect to his admitting noting in his diary
dated 03.01.1975 (Q-15-B), contents of the relevant portion of the diary reads
as under:-
> "Reached Delhi and received by Rajeshwarji at the station. News of the first
> phase of the drama heard at the station.
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara) Page No. 1048 Met Arun, Maya, Prabhaji and others and could not
> resist myself."
1010\. DW-4 has also been examined by accused Ranjan Dwivedi to persuade this
Court to discard the testimony of his distant relative PW- 6 Sh. Virender
Kumar Ojha, who deposed that accused Ranjan Dwivedi was in the company of
Santoshanand and Sudevanand on 01.01.1975 and 02.01.1975. It has come in the
testimony of DW-4 that Ranjan Dwivedi started living with him since January
1973 till September 1974. He deposed that accused Ranjan Dwivedi had been
junior with Sh. V.M. Tarkunde, Senior Advocate and since the receipts of
Ranjan Dwivedi were not much, they were looking after his bread and butter. On
03.01.1975, he received Ranjan Dwivedi, his mother and sister-in-law at New
Delhi Railway Station and they came to his house. He informed Ranjan Dwivedi
about his discussions he had with his elder brother Sh. Sita Ram Dwivedi, a
resident of America that his brother had agreed to his proposed alliance with
an American girl Ms. Patersia. At that time, one more family consisting of two
ladies and one gentleman came to Sh. Ranjan Dwivedi and they also expressed
happiness. Later on, Ranjan Dwivedi married to Ms. Patersia in 1975 at Patna.
He further testified that Sh. Virender Kumar Ojha (PW-6), who is a distant
relative working in Railways at Samastipur, came with his wife for treatment
of his wife in AIIMS Hospital in June 1974 and at that time, Ranjan Dwivedi
used to stay CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1049 with him. They could not help Sh. Virender
Kumar Ojha in treatment of his wife.
1011\. In the cross-examination of DW-4, it has come out that he had no talk
with Ranjan Dwivedi about his visit to Delhi on 03.01.1975 and he had prior
information about visit of Ranjan Dwivedi, his mother and bhabhi on
03.01.1975. He received this information from his eldest brother-in-law Sh.
S.R. Dwivedi, who was living in America.
1012\. Admittedly, Ranjan Dwivedi is very close relative of DW-4 Sh. Rajeshwar
Chaubey. He has not testified at all that Sh. Virender Kumar Ojha (PW-6) was
having any grudge or ever felt offended for not accompanying with them to
AIIMS hospital for treatment of his wife. I have already discussed that
writing in the hands of Ranjan Dwivedi dated 03.01.1975 has no connection with
the alleged consent of his brother to marry with Ms. Patersia. Therefore,
accused Ranjan Dwivedi or his co-accused cannot claim any benefit from the
testimony of DW-4 Rajeshwar Chaubey. This witness neither does speak anything
to counter the Prosecution version nor does swear to tender any plausible
explanation to the entries in the diary of Ranjan Dwivedi. The diary entries
were not even shown by the defence to seek an explanation on the entries in
diary and this witness has spoken to superficial events unconnected to the
facts in issue or contents of diary of accused Ranjan Dwivedi. He did not name
the members of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1050 other family consisting of two ladies and
one male, who came at the Railway Station to receive Ranjan Dwivedi. The names
of those persons are mentioned by Ranjan Dwivedi in his diary as Arun, Maya,
Prabhaji and others. He also could not elaborate their relation with Ranjan
Dwivedi. Ranjan Dwivedi is brother of wife of DW-4 and they are closely
related to each other. The words "could not resist myself" are mentioned by
him with reference to those persons, who were more than three and this writing
has no connection with the alleged information conveyed to him by DW-4 Sh.
Rajeshwar Chaubey. Had it been so, Ranjan Dwivedi must have overjoyed and
could have written it in the diary specifically. So, accused Ranjan Dwivedi
cannot take any benefit from the deposition of DW-4.
1013\. Accused Santoshanand had taken defence of alibi that on the date of
incident i.e. 02.01.1975 at Samastipur, he was at Patna. To prove his defence
the accused Santoshanand has examined only one witness DW-37 Sh. Pranavanand
Avadhoot, who claimed to be the son of the cult head Sh. Anand Murti, deposed
that he has been a fulltime worker of Anand Marg Organisation. During the
period from 1971 to 1975, he was working as Office Secretary of Anand Marg
Organisation. He knew accused Santoshanand, present in the court, and he was
posted at Patna in their cult sometimes in second half of February 1973. He
further testified that during the period from December 1974 to first week of
January 1975, accused Santoshanand Avadhoot was at Patna. In his cross-
examination, DW-37 deposed that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1051 as an Office Secretary,
his duty was to take care of the day to day affairs of the office. During his
tenure, five or six persons used to remain in the office permanently, while
other persons attached to their office, used to do outdoor work. He further
testified that accused Santoshanand was posted as Manager (Public Relation) in
the office and accused Santoshanand was not to do any outdoor work. He stated
that no attendance register was maintained in their office. He voluntarily
stated that they had volunteers. He could not remember the day when anyone of
the volunteers fell sick or stayed away in attending the office. He stated
that Santoshanand did not go away from the office even for a day from middle
of February 1973 to January 1975. He admitted the suggestion of the
prosecution that Anand Murti was arrested on 29.12.1971 in a murder case and
he came out of the Jail in the year 1978.
1014\. A scrutiny of the deposition of PW-37 reveals that he is committed to
Anand Marg Organisation in as much as he has stated the name of his father as
Anand Murti, who is the cult head. He also admitted that he is an Avadhoot and
a fulltime worker of Anand Marg. He admitted that their cult head was arrested
on 29.12.1971 in a murder case. He also knew that Baba was released from Jail
in 1978. He claimed to be Office Secretary of the organisation at Patna and
about posting of Santoshanand as Manager (Public Relation) in the office at
Patna. In his statement even under Section 313 Cr. PC, Santoshanand has not
explained that he had worked as Manager CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1052 (Public Relation)
with the Anand Marg Organisation. He has only explained while replying Q. No.
183 to Q. No. 211 that he had never visited Samastipur in his life; He did not
visit Samastipur on the relevant day; he was not present in Samastipur on the
said date; he did not stay in the waiting room of the first class; and he did
not know Vikram, Sudevanand and Ranjan Dwivedi. He did not explain that he was
posted as Manager (Public Relation) in the office at Patna. DW- 37 has not
placed on record any document to show that he was working as Office Secretary
at Patna or Santoshanand was working as Manager (Public Relation) there.
Accused Santoshanand has not put to any of the prosecution witness that he was
working as Manager (Public Relation) in Anand Marg Organisation. No other
defence witnesses have also stated so about Santoshanand. DW-37 is clever
enough to answer that no attendance register was maintained in their office.
If there were five or six persons, working in the same office, neither of them
has been examined. The plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility of
the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by reason of his presence
at another place and plea can therefore succeed only if it is shown that
accused was so far away at the relevant time that he could not be present at
the place where the crime was committed. This has been so held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Dudh Nath Pandey Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1981 Supreme Court
911. In view of this discussion, I found that deposition of DW-37 does not
inspire any confidence and he has CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided
on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1053 turned up in the witness
box to depose only to help his colleague in the organisation. Moreover, in the
examination-in-chief, he deposed that Santoshanand remained at Patna Office
from December 1975 to first week of January 1975, whereas in his cross-
examination, he extended the period from middle of February 1973 to January
1975. As such, accused Santoshanand has failed to prove the plea of alibi
burden of which lie heavy on him. When the accused having taken the plea of
alibi fails to prove it by cogent evidence, the consequence would be an
adverse inference against that accused person and this would add an additional
link in the chain in case of circumstantial evidence. It has been observed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "Sushil Sharma Vs. State of N.C.T. of Delhi, 2014
(4) SCC 317", that "the evidence on record clearly establishes that the
appellant has not been able to prove the defence of alibi. Adverse inference
needs to be drawn from this fact. False defence of alibi indeed forms a vital
link in the chain of circumstances." Similarly it has been held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Sahabuddin Vs. State of Assam, 2012 (13) SCC 213, that if the
accused does not give any explanation in his statement under Section 313 of
Cr. PC about the plea of alibi, an adverse inference is to be drawn against
him and plea of alibi is liable to be disbelieved.
1015\. Now while turning to the facts of the present case, as discussed herein
before, it has been established by the testimony of approver Vikram PW-2 that
Santoshanand and Sudevanand arrived at Samastipur Railway Station from
Muzaffarpur along with Ranjan CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on
08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1054 Dwivedi on 01.01.1975 and he
met Santoshanand and Sudevanand there. Further, it is established from the
testimony of PW-5 that he accompanied PW-6 with Sh. Ranjan Dwivedi to
Samastipur Railway Station on the evening of 01.01.1975, where they were
introduced by Ranjan Dwivedi to accused Santoshanand. This is further
corroborated by PW-6 that on 01.01.1975, he along with his friend (PW-5) and
accused Ranjan Dwivedi visited Samastipur Railway Station, where Ranjan
Dwivedi introduced them to Santoshanand as his distant relative and friend.
Next day also i.e. on 02.01.1975, PW-6 met Santoshanand and Sudevanand with
Ranjan Dwivedi and he was introduced to Sudevanand also. He also found
Santoshanand and Sudevanand at the venue of Samastipur Railway Station on
02.01.1975 about 12.00 Noon and again at about 03.30 PM. Therefore, it has
been conclusively established beyond reasonable doubt that accused
Santoshanand was very much present at Samastipur Railway Station from the
evening of 01.01.1975 till the evening of 02.01.1975. Thus, accused
Santoshanand has failed to prove the plea of alibi and the same is hereby
rejected. This adds additional link in completing the chain of the
circumstances.
81) Consent by the State of Bihar to CBI for investigation.
1016\. Immediately after the incident on 02.01.1975 at Samastipur Railway
Station, it was the Bihar Police, who was conducting the investigations, which
was taken over by CID, Bihar. Subsequently, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1055 the State of
Bihar has granted its consent for investigation to Delhi Special Police
Establishment i.e. CBI on 03.01.1975 with regard to both the incidents of
Samastipur dated 02.01.1975. Subsequently, the State of Bihar has also given
its consent to Delhi Special Police Establishment for investigations in the
cases vide FIR No. 24 dated 07.01.1974 PS Kotwali Patna and FIR No. 71 dated
13.07.1974 of PS Kotwali Bhagalpur on 13.09.1975. To prove this, prosecution
has examined the then Deputy Secretary, Home Department, Government of Bihar
Sh. K.K. Tripathi as PW-64.
1017\. PW-64 Sh. K.K. Tripathi deposed that the Government of Bihar gave
consent for investigation of case No. 1 dated 02.1.1975 of GRP, Samastipur and
Case No. 1 dated 02.1.1975 of PS Samastipur U/s. 6 of Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act. He also deposed that investigation of the case No. 24 dated
07.01.1974 PS Patna Kotwali and case No. 71 dated 13.7.1974 of PS Kotwali
Bhagalpur were also allowed to be investigated by DSPE by the Government of
Bihar U/s. 6 of the said Act. These two Notifications were published on
13.09.1975. The Gazette Notifications of Government of Bihar are Ex.PW-64/A
and Ex.PW-64/B. Sh. D.N. Ahuja, DIG CBI wrote a letter dated 17.12.1975 to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar requesting for consent of the competent
authority for prosecution of eight accused persons under Section 4 and 5 of
Explosive Substance Act. He also sent certain documents i.e. Report of
Investigation and copy of Notification of the Government of India dated
14.05.1957.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1056 The request was in respect of Patna Kotwali Case No.
24/1974, Bhagalpur Case No. 71/1974 and Samastipur GRP Case No. 1/1975. He
deposed that vide order No. 6905 dated 27.12.1975 Ex.PW-64/C, consent was
granted by the Government of Bihar for the prosecution of the persons (i) Ram
Aasrey, (ii) Santoshanand Avadhoot @ Ghanshyam @ Vinod @ Prabhu @ Jitendra

Avadhoot @ Vijay @ Madan Mohan Srivastava,
(vi) Vinayanand Avadhoot @ Jagdish @ Ram Mohan @ Anand Kumar, (vii) Gopalji @
Krishan Mohan Singh and (viii) Ram Nagina Prasad @ Bhaiya. He also deposed
that with respect to case No. 1 PS Samastipur, Notification Ex.PW-64/D was
issued on 03.01.1975 and similarly Notification Ex.PW-64/E was issued on
03.01.1975 by the Government of Bihar under his signatures with respect to
investigation of the case No. 1 dated 02.01.1975, GRP Samastipur.
1018\. In his cross-examination, PW-64 deposed that one Thakur made a
confessional statement before the Magistrate, but his name does not appear in
the Order Ex.PW-64/C. He deposed that the order Ex.PW-64/C was prepared in his
office and his office has put up before him the whole file along with the
draft consent order and then he sent the file to the Law department for
vetting. He has denied the suggestion that he has not applied his mind before
the consent was given.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1057 1019\. As per the Notification No. 54 dated
03.01.1975 Ex.PW-64/D, the Governor of Bihar gave the consent of the
Government of Bihar to the members of Delhi Special Police Establishment under
Section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 for extension of
their powers and jurisdiction in the whole of the State of Bihar for
investigation of the offences with regard to case No. 1 of 02.01.1975, PS

CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1058 (All four notifications Ex.PW-64/A, Ex.PW-64/B,
Ex.PW-64/D and Ex.PW-64/E are available in Folder R-7) The Governor of Bihar
by order No. 6905 dated 27.12.1975 Ex.PW- 64/C has also accorded the consent
of the Government of Bihar for the prosecution and trial of the charge sheeted
persons for the offences under Section 4 and 5 of Explosive Substance Act,
1908 in respect of the above said FIRs dated 07.01.1974, 13.07.1974 and
02.01.1975.
(The notification Ex.PW-64/C is available in Folder R-68) 1020\. Having
discussed the entire gamut of the events leading to the present prosecution,
which are proved under different heads for the sake of convenience and for the
sake of understanding the case and further having analyzed the evidence by
appreciating the same in the context of the law governing the subject, this
court now hastens to answer the charges framed against the accused as
hereunder.
82) Conclusion:-
(i) Charge No. 1.
1021\. The charge No. 1 framed by my Ld. Predecessor against accused (1)
Santoshanand Avadhoot @ Ghanshyam @ Vinod @ Prabhu, (2) Sudevanand Avadhoot @
Bharat @ Misri Lal Yadav, (3) Ram Janam Dwivedi @ Ranjan Dwivedi s/o Late Ram
Dev Dwivedi, CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1059 (4) Arteshanand Avadhoot (ABATED UPON HIS
DEATH), (7) Gopalji @ Krishna Mohan Singh.
1022\. It is alleged against them that at Trimohan in the year 1973, all the
above persons (except Gopalji and Ranjan Dwivedi) along with three Proclaimed
Offenders namely Ram Kumar, Vinayanand and Ram Aasrey and the approver
Visheshwaranand have conceived an idea to secure the release of Prabhat Ranjan
Sarkar @ Anand Murti by the means unknown to law. They conspired with such an
objective to do certain violent acts to eliminate one Madhavanand, Sh. L.N.
Mishra, the then Railway Minister, Abdul Gaffoor, the then Chief Minister of
Bihar, Officers of CBI Sh. Puri and Sh. Hingorani, Jail Doctor and Civil
Surgeon, Patna and that the A-7 Gopalji joined the conspiracy later by
convening the meetings of the conspirators at his house at Chautham and
farmhouse at Tilihar and collected and kept arms, ammunitions and hand
grenades to accomplish the common design and that Ram Janam Dwivedi (A-3)
joined the conspiracy at Samastipur on 01.01.1975 and arranged the entry
passes for the accused persons Santoshanand, Sudevanand and approver Vikram to
reach the spot namely the Platform No. 3 of Samastipur Railway Station on
02.01.1975 and murdered Sh. L.N. Mishra, and thus all of them were charged for
the offence of criminal conspiracy, punishable under Section 120-B of IPC.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1060 1023\. It is pertinent to mention that the above act
of conspiracy springs from several factors. To understand these factors, we
need to comprehend as to who this Anand Murti @ Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar is? The
said person is a cult figure. The said Anand Murti (1921-1990) was an Ex-
employee of the Indian Railways. He is no more now. He had developed certain
interests in the occultism, religion, spirituality, philosophy, yoga,
metaphysics etc. He had developed his own ideas to the material life and
living, which he wanted to propagate. He was successful in his mission,
gathered a huge following in the North- Eastern India, North India, and
abroad. It seems that he had developed certain socio-economic theories also
and the ultimate goal of his philosophy is to spread the Ananda (Bliss) and an
orderly society, which he called the SADVIPRA SAMAJ, a society based on
morality. The cult head had an object of setting up SDVIPRA RAJ, a rule of
moralist. It is revealed from the record that under peculiar circumstances, he
was arrested in a case of murder of one of his followers. He was kept in Jail.
All the efforts of his followers to have him enlarged on bail, had failed. The
followers were given an impression that the establishment and the Jail
authorities had conceived evil designs to finish him off. Thus, further
impression was spread that the cult head namely Anand Murti is being poisoned
in the Jail. The forlorn and resented followers wanted their Guru, also called
Baba, be released by hook or crook. They resorted to unconstitutional methods
for securing his release. It is a matter of record that some of CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1061 the followers have taken out processions, conducted protests,
pressurized the State and Union Governments, and even went to the extent of
self-immolations to have him released in their unflinching love and affection
towards their Guru. When they failed by all their means, the followers of the
cult known as Anand Marg consisting of several wings and cadres including
Monks known as Avadhoots, who don saffron clothes, showing separate and
distinct identity of their personality by growing beards, unkempt hair and
adhering to special code of dress and conduct, have resorted to the means not
known to the law. The accused hereinabove are the followers of the cult known
as Anand Marga.
1024\. Thus, the persons facing trial, with a living image seated in their
heart, conceived the conspiracy. The entire case is based on the Approvers'
statement and the circumstantial evidence. I have already discussed the legal
aspects canvassed on behalf of the accused with regard to the legalities such
as defect in the charge sheet, clubbing of investigations of four cases,
legality of grant of pardon to the accomplices, the Approvers' statement, non-
examination of the Magistrate recording the statements under Section 164 of
Cr. PC, the stigma attached to the statement of approver PW-1 as regards the
inducement of his re-employment, the snapping of conspiracy by PW- 1 etc. in
the foregoing chapters of this judgment. In order to arrive at the conclusions
based on the ocular testimony of numerous witnesses examined on behalf of the
prosecution, defence and such of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1062 witnesses called
by the court and after wading through the voluminous documentary evidence, I
have distinctly analyzed each and every aspect of criminal conspiracy under
different headings owing to the special circumstances, which forms the part of
the conspiracy in the background of the peculiarity of this case. Each of the
circumstances categorized under different chapters with suitable captions, the
summary of my findings rendered therein separately with reasons recorded
therein after appreciating the evidence, is being summarized, which would lead
to my conclusion on the above charge.
1025\. I have already held that cumulative effect of the evidence conclusively
establishes that there was a cult known as Anand Marg, which was established
by Anand Murti @ Baba @ Guru @ Tarak Brahma @ Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. There
were several wings of this cult known as PFI (Progressive Federation of
India), Sewa Dharam Mission, Voluntary Social Service/Vishwa Shanti Sena
(VSS), ERAWS (Education Relief and Welfare Section) and Political Wing PBI
(Proutist Block of India). It had also a Revolutionary Group formed only with
an aim to secure the release of the cult head. It is also revealed from the
evidence that the cadres included Monks, Yoga Teachers, Sadhaks and Avadhoots.
The evidence also shows that the Organization had a publication wing to
propagate the ideas of the organization, its philosophy and the need to
establish a society based on morality, for which it had some printing units at
Delhi, Jaipur, Indore and Ranchi etc. From the entire evidence, this court did
not CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1063 find anything to disbelieve that there was no such
Organization founded by Anand Murti and its wings. The accused facing the
trial, did not demolish the ocular testimony of PW-1 and PW-2, which is
corroborated by the testimony of PW-11, PW-13, PW-33, PW-34, PW-61, PW-63,
PW-68, PW-79, PW-83, PW-84 and DW-8.
1026\. Though the defence had feigned in their arguments with regard to the
formation of the Revolutionary Group, after going through the testimony of
PW-1 and PW-2, it becomes clear that there was a Revolutionary Group,
corroborated by the acts of the accused and the Approvers spoken through the
evidence of PW-27, PW-34 and PW-80 and that of the evidence of PW-19, who had
proved the stay of PW-1 twice at Indore to secure arms to achieve the object
conceived by the conspirators and the approvers. A comprehensive view of the
evidence available on record do suggest indelibly the acts of the accused in
procuring the arms and ammunitions and their sojourn undertaken in procuring
the same for the purposes of achieving the object and the conduct of PW-1,
PW-2, A-1 and A-2 in giving up their prescribed attire of a Monk and to live
incognito till the object is achieved.
1027\. In the backdrop of conspiracy hatched at Trimohan, I have already held
that from the evidence of PW-1, PW-2, PW-11, PW-13, PW-33, PW-50 & PW-68, this
court has concluded that that the Anand Margies did hold a Rally at Boat Club,
New Delhi in the month of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1064 April, 1973 to pressurize the
Government to release their cult head Anand Murti/Baba. This has been admitted
by accused Ranjan Dwivedi in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr. PC
and that one Aacharya Dineshwaranand committed self-immolation next day after
the Rally at Purana Quila with the same purpose to pressurize the government.
An FIR No. 209 dated 24.04.1973 was also registered with PS Tilak Marg, Delhi
and accused Santoshanand was co-accused there.
1028\. To further pressurize the Government for release of Baba, Anand Margies
have taken out a demonstration and gherao of the then Chief Minister Sh. Abdul
Gaffoor on 28.07.1973 at Patna. At that time, emotional slogans like "JAIL KA
PHATAK TUTEGA, ANAND MURTI CHHUTEGA" were raised by the Anand Margies and they
have gheraoed the Chief Minister Sh. Abdul Gaffoor at his residence and an FIR
No. 68 dated 28.07.1973 was registered with PS Kotwali, Patna. This has been
so arrived at in the earlier part of the judgment.
1029\. When the Anand Margies failed to secure release of Baba, a
Revolutionary Group was formed by one Aacharya Rudranand Avadhoot, which was
joined by Aacharya Ram Aasrey, Visheshwaranand, Vinayanand, approver Vikram,
Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Arteshanand, Ram Kumar, Budheshawaranand and
Gopalji. After formation of Revolutionary Group, PW-1, PW-2, Santoshanand,
Sudevanand and others have changed their attire of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1065
Avadhoot and gave up saffron clothes, removed beard and moustaches and cut
long hair to conceal their identity. Thereafter, some of the
Avadhoots/Aacharya have propagated that Anand Murti was seriously ill to give
an impression in the minds of the workers, so that they may work with renewed
zeal for release of Baba, which is evident from the statement of PW-1, PW-2,
PW-11, PW-13, PW-27, PW-33, PW-34, PW-68 and PW-80.
1030\. Subsequently, in the month of August and September 1973, conspirators
after their meeting with Ram Aasrey in the house owned by Prem Kumar at Patna,
sent PW-1 to Indore to collect arms and ammunitions on payment from PW-34 Sh.
Jagat Ram Dogra, who had earlier received Diksha from PW-1 in the year 1967.
During his both visits on 26.08.1973 and 10.09.1973, PW-1 has stayed in the
Gujrati Lodge/Aadarsh Lodge, Indore under the pseudonym Vijay and this has
been proved by PW-19 and the documentary evidence collected. The signatures
and handwriting of PW-1 on the Visitor's Register in the handwriting of PW-1
have been proved by PW-126A Sh. Maheshwar Prasad.
1031\. Thereafter, PW-1, Vinayanand, Shankaranand, Sudevanand and Arteshanand
went to Trimohan, where Ram Kumar had given them training in use of arms and
ammunitions, which is proved through the testimony of the approver PW-1, whose
testimony as discussed in the judgment is credible, consistent and
trustworthy.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1066 1032\. Ultimately, in the month of October 1973, a
criminal conspiracy was hatched on the terrace of the house of Ram Kumar at
Trimohan and the meeting was attended by PW-1, Vinayanand, Arteshanand,
Sudevanand, Santoshanand and Ram Kumar and others. In the said meeting, it was
decided to kill Madhavanand, L.N. Mishra, Abdul Gaffoor, Mr. Puri, Hingorani
and others. The appreciation of evidence and the findings are dealt in the
chapter with the caption "Criminal Conspiracy at Trimohan".
1033\. I have already held that pursuant to the criminal conspiracy, accused
Budheshawaranand (since dead) suggested that in future the house of Ram Kumar
at Trimohan was not the appropriate place to keep arms and ammunitions and
suggested the house of Gopalji at Chautham as alternative. It has also been
held that PW-1, Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand and Ram
Kumar went to Bhagalpur at the house of Gopalji near Janta Library and there
Santoshanand gave a letter in the name of one Saroj Kumar Biswas of Bangaon to
PW-1 to bring the arms and ammunitions from him. At that time, the request of
Santoshanand was accepted by accused Gopalji for holding the meeting at his
house at Chautham and farmhouse at Tilihar and for collection of arms and
ammunitions. Meanwhile, PW-1 brought one country made revolver 303, two live
cartridges and 110 other cartridges and he handed over the same to accused
Gopalji. Thus, Gopalji has actively joined conspiracy by accepting the
consignment of the arms and ammunitions. PW-1 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1067 informed
Santoshanand that Mr. Biswas could not arrange hand grenades, but he was
trying for it. Then after some parleys, Santoshanand and Vinayanand left for
Bangaon to bring hand grenades from Mr. Biswas of Bangaon. As accused
Santoshanand got late there, he sent a telegram under his assumed name of
"Prabhu" addressed to Gopalji and this telegram Ex.PW-1/O was recovered from
the house search of Gopalji on 17.05.1975 by PW-134 Sh. M.M.P. Sinha in the
presence of PW-91. In order to make use of 110 cartridges, Arteshanand and
Sudevanand left Chautham on the mission to get manufactured a firearm from Sh.
Manohar Darve of Jabalpur, who was brought in the house at Gulzar Bagh, Patna,
but Arteshanand and Sudevanand were not successful in their attempt, which is
evident from the statement of PW-1, PW-44, PW-105.
1034\. I have already held that subsequently in December 1973, arms and
ammunitions were shifted from the house of Gopalji at Chautham to the house
taken on rent at Gulzar Bagh, Patna.
1035\. In order to execute the conspiracy to kill Abdul Gaffoor, Santoshanand
deputed PW-1 to track the movements of Abdul Gaffoor at Patna, who used to
visit Hotel Republic and also the house of a Muslim Family and as PW-1 had not
seen Abdul Gaffoor personally, Santoshanand procured his photo from the office
of newspaper "PRADEEP" or "VISHWABANDHU", where father of Santoshanand namely
Sh. Narinder Narain Verma was working in the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1068 editorial
section. On advice of accused Santoshanand, PW-1 has also visited at the
residence of Sh. Abdul Gaffoor in the guise of a Businessman, saw him and the
place well guarded. After his visit, PW-1 informed Santoshanand in the
presence of Arteshanand and Sudevanand that it was such a guarded place that
it would be impossible to escape after killing him. This is corroborated from
the statements of PW-1, PW-33 and PW-143. The accused Santoshanand examined
his brother Sushil Kumar as DW-19 but could not cause any dent in the case of
the prosecution.
1036\. On 29.12.1973, PW-1 under the assumed name of Shankar Kumar Gupta of
Karol Bagh, Delhi stayed in Hotel Republic, Patna. This has been proved by the
testimony of PW-1, PW-16, PW-17, PW- 126A, PW-129, PW-134 and PW-147 and
record of the Hotel Republic. When it was reported by PW-1 that Abdul Gaffoor
did not come to Hotel Republic, Patna, accused Santoshanand ascertained from
someone that he used to visit a Muslim family near Palace Hotel, Opposite
Gandhi Maidan Patna and gave a loaded revolver to PW-1. From 30.12.1973 to
04.01.1974, PW-1, Arteshanand and Sudevanand kept a watch during 08.00 PM to
12.00 Night on a rickshaw near Palace Hotel. Santoshanand himself used to
supervise the action. This is evident from the statement of PW-1 and PW-67.
1037\. Pursuant to the criminal conspiracy, on 05.01.1974, Vinayanand brought
a hand grenade from Bangaon, which was shown CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod
Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1069 to PW-1,
Arteshanand and Sudevanand at Gulzar Bagh House at Patna. After 2 or 3 hours,
Santoshanand also reached there and suggested that they should leave Abdul
Gaffoor for the time being and follow Madhavanand, who is scheduled to be
produced before the District Magistrate, Patna on 07.01.1974 and accordingly
an unsuccessful attempt was made by Vinayanand on the direction of accused
Santoshanand to kill Madhavanand, who was an approver in a case registered
against the cult head of Anand Marg namely Sh. Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand
Murti, under Section 302 of IPC. This can be gleaned from the statement of
PW-1, PW-7, PW-8, PW-9, PW-10, PW-18, PW-92, PW-134, PW-138, PW-140 and
PW-150.
1038\. One day prior to attack on Madhavanand, after discussion among PW-1,
Vinayanand, Arteshanand, Sudevanand and Santoshanand, on direction of
Santoshanand, PW-1 left for Chautham on 06.01.1974 and reached there on
07.01.1974. He stayed at the house of Gopalji and after hearing the news of an
unsuccessful attempt on the life of Madhavanand, on the advice of Gopalji,
PW-1 shifted himself to farmhouse of Gopalji at Tilihar, where he stayed until
15.01.1974. As planned, when Santoshanand did not come there, PW- 1 came back
from Tilihar to Chautham and after 2-3 days, Arteshanand and Sudevanand also
reached there and a telegram Ex.PW-1/S was received on 17.01.1974 by Gopalji
from Santoshanand under his assumed name of "Prabhu". After 1 or 2 days,
Santoshanand also reached there and expressed regret that they CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1070 had not been successful in their mission and it was decided to
bring Ram Kumar to chalk out further programme. The recovery of telegram
Ex.PW-1/S from the house search of Gopalji at Chautham on 17.05.1975 and the
corresponding evidence available is already discussed in the judgment at
length. Attempt of PW-1 to bring Ram Kumar in the fourth week of January 1974,
failed and then they went to Ram Kumar's house on 06.02.1974. Then on
06.02.1974, PW-1, Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand, Ram Kumar and
Tyageshwaranand participated in the meeting on 06.02.1974 at Trimohan.
Santoshanand told them that they were short of arms and ammunitions and next
meeting would be held on 15.02.1974 and everyone shall leave for convenient
places for shelter. However, Tyageshwaranand @ Budheshawaranand was asked by
Santoshanand that he should go Madhubani, where Abdul Gaffoor was fighting
elections and to keep watch on his activities. Meanwhile, parents of PW-1 came
to the house of Sham Lal Dass at Lahariya Sarai, and at that time PW-1
resolved that he would part company with the organization and Revolutionary
Group as well. He did not attend the meeting at Trimohan on 15.02.1974. In the
last week of February 1974, Ram Kumar could not impress PW-1 to accompany him
and PW-1 informed that he would like to live with his parents. His marriage
was solemnized on 02.06.1974 and after one month of his marriage
Tyageshwaranand brought a letter from Santoshanand asking him to rejoin the
organization, but he declined. After reading the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1071
letter, PW-1 handed over the same to Tyageshwaranand, who tore it off.
1039\. From the above said discussion, this court is of the firm opinion that
the prosecution successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that in
the month of October 1973, a conspiracy was hatched at the terrace of the
house of Ram Kumar at Trimohan, which was attended by PW-1, Vinayanand,
Arteshanand, Sudevanand, Santoshanand and Ram Kumar and others. In the said
meeting, it was agreed to secure release of Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar @ Anand
Murti by resorting to violent acts, by procuring arms and ammunitions and to
commit murder of Madhavanand, L.N. Mishra, Abdul Gaffoor, Officers of CBI Sh.
Puri and Hingorani, Jail Doctor and Civil Surgeon, Patna. It is also
established on record beyond reasonable doubt that accused Gopalji
subsequently joined this conspiracy, when he consented to hold meetings of the
co-conspirators at his house at Chautham and farmhouse at Tilihar and also
started storing arms, ammunitions and hand grenades to accomplish the common
design. It is also found from the evidence on record that approver Vikram had
also joined the conspiracy in the end of June 1974, when he met accused
Santoshanand in the market of South Extension, Part-I, New Delhi, which I have
discussed under the different heads about the role of Vikram, the incident
happened at Khanjarpur (Bhagalpur), participation at Chautham meetings of the
Group, his visits to Indo- Nepal Border, attempts to secure arms by visiting
several places CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1072 Narkatiaganj, Bitia, Chamua, Chakia and
Rajgir etc. These have been dealt exhaustively qua the evidence available
after duly appreciating the ocular and documentary testimony.
1040\. I am satisfied that the prosecution established that Vikram was the
part of the conspiracy and actively participated at every level after his
meeting with A-1 in June 1974, visited Samastipur, arranged accommodation for
himself and also for A-1 and A-2; saw Ranjan Dwivedi at Samastipur Railway
Station, sneaked into the crowd at the venue where L.N. Mishra was to address
with the help of a Pass procured through Ranjan Dwivedi, carried a hand
grenade, which was left unattended on the railway track and disappeared
thereon only to find again in the company of other accused at Chakia &
Bhagalpur and was active till he turned an approver.
1041\. The role of Ranjan Dwivedi is already discussed in detail. He joined
conspiracy by visiting Samastipur along with Santoshanand and Sudevanand from
Muzaffarpur by bus to make arrangement for Passes/Badges to reach the venue.
(Per the testimonies of PW-2, PW- 5 and PW-6). The documentary evidence
retrieved by the prosecution at the Railway Station concerning the Reservation
Slip, Chart and the scribblings in his diary, which is discussed elsewhere
conclusively establishes that he reached Samastipur, arranged the Passes for
the accused and left before the scheduled function took place due to delay. It
is also clear from his own admission under Section 313 Cr. PC that CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1073 he met Baba on 17.12.1974 and his visits made to meet the Guru
in the Jail is proved through documentary evidence. Therefore, this court does
not find any reason to disbelieve the prosecution version proved through
overwhelming oral and documentary evidence, which are highly trustworthy and
cannot be discarded or read otherwise.
1042\. Thus, the charge U/s. 120-B of IPC stands duly proved against all the
accused persons namely Santoshanand, Sudevanand, Ranjan Dwivedi @ Ram Janam
Dwivedi and Gopalji. Accordingly, they are held guilty of the said offence.
(ii) Charge No. 2.
1043\. This charge is against accused Ram Janam Dwivedi under Section 302 read
with Section 109 and 112 of IPC for abetting Santoshanand, Sudevanand and
Vikram in commission of an offence to murder L.N. Mishra, which was committed
in consequence of his abetment when Sudevanand exploded live hand grenade on
the Dais, which resulted in the death of L.N. Mishra, Surya Narain Jha and Ram
Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore. The other part of the charge is that Ram Janam
Dwivedi had abetted Sudevanand and Santoshanand and Vikram to throw a live
hand grenade on the Dais and thereby caused grievous hurt to eight persons
namely Ram Bhagat Paswan, Kailash Pati Mishra, Brij Mohan Sharma, Ram Vinod
Sharma, B.N. Prasad, Ajay Kumar, Kapil Dev Narain Singh and Smt. Lalita Devi
in addition to the murder of said three persons and committed the offence
under CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1074 Section 326 read with Section 112 IPC. The other part
of the charge is that Ram Janam Dwivedi has abetted Santoshanand, Sudevanand
and Vikram to throw a live hand grenade on the Dais and thereby caused hurt to
Jagan Nath Mishra, Rama Kant Jha, Jayant Banerjee, Baleshwar Ram, Suresh
Prasad Singh, Umesh Prasad Singh, Bisheshwar Rai, Satender Prasad Singh,
Parmanand Jha, Suraj Chaudahry, Smt. Noor Jahan, Jamuna Prasad Mandal, Suraj
Narayan Mandal, Pramod Prasad, I.D. Sharma, Naval Kishore, P.R. Chopra and
C.S. Chaudhary and committed an offence under Section 324 read with Section
112 IPC.
1044\. Before rendering the findings on the above charge which is exclusively
against accused Ranjan Dwivedi under Section 302 r/w 109, 302 r/w 112, 326 r/w
112 and 324 r/w 112 IPC, this court cannot be oblivious of the omnibus charges
against all the accused including the present accused for the offences under
Section 302, 120-B IPC, 326 r/w 120-B & 324 r/w 120-B IPC is framed by my
learned predecessor for the very acts in causing the deaths of three persons
and injuries to several persons concerning the incident dated 02.01.1975.
1045\. Having kept the same in mind, this court is of the opinion that since
the present accused Ranjan Dwivedi against whom the instant charges are
arraigned, need not be again charged for the offences for abetment in view of
the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1075 Court in Kehar
Singh Vs. Union of India AIR 1988 SC 1883 - which is reproduced for the
benefit of understanding the implications and the redundancy of charging
Section 109, 112 of IPC against a person who is already held guilty for the
offence under Section 120-B of IPC under charge No. 1.
1046\. I have already held in charge No. 1 that all the accused have
participated actively in the criminal conspiracy which I have discussed
elaborately and also I have come to the conclusion that all the accused
including the proclaimed offenders had committed the offence of criminal
conspiracy under Section 120-B IPC. In this backdrop, the ruling of Kehar
Singh (Supra) comes into play and relevant Para reads as under:
> "258. The concept of criminal conspiracy will be dealt with in detail a
> little later. For the present, it may be sufficient to state that the gist
> of the offence of criminal conspiracy created under Section 120-A is a bare
> agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under Section
> 120-B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of Section
> 107 requires that there must be something more than a mere conspiracy. There
> must be some act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That
> CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
> (Shahdara) Page No. 1076 would be evident by the wordings of Section 107
> (Secondly) : "engages in any conspiracy..... for the doing of that thing, if
> an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
> conspiracy......" The punishments for these two categories of crimes are
> also quite different. Section 109 Indian Penal Code is concerned only with
> the punishment abetments of for which no express provision is made under the
> Indian Penal Code. A charge under Section 109 should, therefore, be along
> with some other substantive offence committed in consequence of abetment.
> The offence of criminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent
> offence. It is made punishable under Section 120-B for which a charge under
> Section 109 Indian Penal Code is unnecessary and indeed, inappropriate."
1047\. It appears that my learned predecessor has framed this charge of
abetment against accused Ranjan Dwivedi as an alternative charge. In view of
this discussion, this charge becomes inconsequential, unnecessary and
inappropriate in view of the charge under Section 120-B IPC having been
already held as proved against all the accused including Ranjan Dwivedi. Thus,
the present charge for abetment concerning the deaths and injuries is dropped
being redundant.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1077
(iii) Charge No. 3.
1048\. This charge is against accused Sudevanand under section 302 IPC for
intentionally causing death of L. N. Mishra, Surya Narayan Jha and Ram Kishore
Prasad Singh Kishore, AND under section 326 IPC for causing grievous hurt to
eight persons mentioned herein before AND under section 324 IPC for causing
hurt to aforesaid eighteen persons by throwing a live hand grenade on the Dais
at platform No. 3, Samastipur Railway Station on 02/01/1975 at about 05:30 PM.
1049\. To answer this charge, the findings arrived by me under the different
chapters, need not be repeated again. However, the gist of the prosecution
case which is based on the sole testimony of PW-2 Vikram an approver in this
case is highly corroborated in each and every point on material particulars
and further corroborated by the circumstantial evidence which I have discussed
throughout the judgment. This establishes the presence of A-1, A-2 and PW-2
near the rostrum at platform no. 3 Samastipur Railway Station on 02/01/1975,
who entered the venue with the help of Passes arranged by A-3, who visited
Samastipur on 01.01.1975 and visited the venue also twice on 02.01.1975. The
then railway minister L.N. Mishra arrived to inaugurate B.G. Line late. In
that function their presence is conclusively established not only by the sole
testimony of PW-2 but by the circumstantial evidence that is gathered through
the evidence of CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1078 other witnesses particularly PW-6 whose
testimony is highly reliable, coherent and creditworthy. PW-6 had proved that
he along with A-3 remained present along with the other accused Santoshanand
and Sudevanand prior to the event at the spot but the event got delayed due to
the late arrival of L.N. Mishra. By that time A-3 had left the venue at 04.00
PM. It is established from the testimony of PW-2 that it was Sudevanand who
flung a hand grenade/bomb, which he carried with him. It is also established
from the testimony of PW-2 that PW-2 himself and A-1 were also carrying one
hand grenade each. The one flung by Sudevanand exploded on the Dais. There was
commotion which resulted into injuries initially to many persons assembled on
the Dais. The detailed testimony of several witnesses coupled with the
documentary evidence clearly amplifies and establishes that all the dead and
the injured were present on the Dias. In the said incident, Shri L.N. Mishra,
who was seriously injured, was shifted for treatment to Danapur where he
succumbed to his injuries on 03/01/1975 at 9:30 AM. One person Surya Narayan
Jha succumbed to his injuries at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital on
04/01/1975. The third injured Shri Ram Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore succumbed
to his injuries on 03.01.1975 in the railway hospital, Samastipur. All these
deaths are as a result of severe injuries, internal bleeding, piercing of
splinters of explosion in their bodies, mutilation of body in respect of Shri
Ram Kishore Prasad Singh Kishore.
CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ
(Shahdara) Page No. 1079 1050\. As discussed throughout the judgment under
various chapters the prosecution is successful to prove that injured persons
namely Ram Bhagat Paswan, Kailash Pati Mishra, Brij Mohan Sharma, Ram Vinod
Sharma, B.N. Parsad, Ajay Kumar, and Smt. Lalita Devi have suffered grievous
hurt as a result of the explosion of hand grenade on the Dais on 02/01/1975
and the persons namely Dr. Jagan Nath Mishra, Rama Kant Jha, Jayant Banerjee,
Baleshwar Ram, Suresh Parshad Singh, Umesh Parshad Singh, Bisheshwar Rai,
Satender Parsad Singh, Parmanand Jha, Suraj Chaudhary, Smt. Noor Jahan, Jamuna
Prasad Mandal, Suraj Narain Mandal, Pramod Parshad, Naval Kishore, P.R.
Chopra, C.S. Chaudhary and Kapil Dev Narain Singh, suffered hurt due to the
explosion of the bomb/grenade thrown/flung by accused Sudevanand who had
intentionally and knowingly had caused it to explode on the Dais resulting
into three deaths and injuries to several persons as above. After wading
through the entire evidence both oral and documentary evidence running to
several volumes, this court is satisfied that all the ingredients for the
offences U/s. 302/326/324 IPC are proved beyond reasonable doubt against this
accused Sudevanand who had worked in tandem of criminal conspiracy with A-1,
A-3, A-7, Ram Kumar and Vinayanand (both P.O.) and the approvers.
(iv) Charge No. 4.
1051\. This charge is framed against accused Santoshanand and Sudevanand
concerning the same incident under section 302 IPC read CBI Vs. Santoshanand
etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1080
with section 34 IPC, 326 IPC read with section 34 IPC and 324 IPC read with
section 34 IPC. All the accused persons in the trial have already been charged
and held guilty under section 120-B IPC for hatching criminal conspiracy to
kill certain persons under charge no.1.
1052\. Since the accused Sudevanand had been held guilty for the offences
under sections 302/326/324 IPC, the other accused being part of the criminal
conspiracy which has been proved, for which I have already held them guilty
for the offence under section 120-B of IPC, while dealing with the charge, it
becomes necessary to understand the thin difference between the common
intention and criminal conspiracy. This court is conscious of the facts proved
on record coupled with all the circumstantial evidence that Sudevanand has
been very active and carried a hand grenade given to him by Santoshanand and
both along with PW-2 were possessing explosives to create a mayhem at the
venue with a common intention which sprang from the criminal conspiracy
conceived by them along with others at Trimohan which was later on joined by
approver Vikram PW-2 and accused Gopal Ji, followed by Ranjan Dwivedi for
which I had already returned my findings.
1053\. In this background it is noteworthy to analyze, understand the
trappings, the thin difference, implications and affectations of the criminal
conspiracy as described under sections 120A IPC and 120 B IPC, the common
intention as found under section 34 of IPC. The CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc.
Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1081 ruling
of the Apex Court in Noor Mohammad Mohd. Yusuf Momin v. State of Maharashtra
AIR 1971 SC 885 guides as under:-
> "7. So far as Section 34 Indian Penal Code is concerned, it embodies the

1054\. Since, the offence under section 120-B IPC which carries a wider
amplitude is already held proved against all the accused, though the common
intention of Santoshanand and Sudevanand overlaps the criminal conspiracy.
Considering the larger implications of proved criminal conspiracy, this court
is of the view that holding the above two accused guilty of the offences
coupled with the common intention as described under section 34 of IPC would
amount to trumpeting again, since the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down that
section 120-B of IPC carries wider amplitude even if no steps is taken since
section 120-B of IPC is by itself an offence made punishable in the year 1913.
Thus, it is inevitable for this court to drop the above charge no. 4 as
becoming nugatory.
(v) Charge No. 5.
1055\. This charge is framed against accused Santoshanand, Sudevanand,
Arteshanand (since dead), Gopal Ji and Ram Janam Dwivedi under section 302 IPC
read with section 120-B IPC, 326 IPC read with section 120-B IPC and 324 IPC
read with section 120-B IPC in respect of death of above said three persons
and grievous hurt to 7 CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1084 persons and hurt to eighteen
persons in the bomb attack at Samastipur Railway Station on 02/01/1975 where
the then Railway Minister L.N. Mishra was to inaugurate the B. G. Line by
holding a function in which the bomb hurled by Sudevanand exploded resulting
into the death of the minister also among the three dead.
1056\. This is a substantial and omnibus charge against all the accused. This
court has already held guilty of all the above accused for the offence under
section 120-B of IPC in charge no. 1 for the reasons aforesaid in the judgment
throughout. Likewise, this court has also held guilty Sudevanand for the
offences under sections 302/324/326 IPC concerning the same incident under
charge no. 2. Since the offence under section 120-B IPC is already held
proved, the act of Sudevanand in committing in offences under sections
302/324/326 IPC concerning the same incident under charge no. 2 is binding on
all the above accused equally, efficaciously under the principle of criminal
joint liability recognized by sections 120A of IPC and 120-B of IPC.
1057\. Thus, this court holds that A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-7 guilty for the
offences under section 302 IPC read with section 120-B IPC, 326 IPC read with
section 120-B IPC and 324 IPC read with section 120-B IPC for causing the
death of Sh. L.N. Mishra, Sh. Surya Narain Jha and Ram Kishore Prasad Singh
Kishore and grievous hurt to Ram Bhagat Paswan, Kailash Pati Mishra, Brij
Mohan Sharma, Ram Vinod CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1085 Sharma, B.N. Parsad, Ajay Kumar,

Jamuna Prasad Mandal, Suraj Narain Mandal, Pramod Parshad, Naval Kishore, P.R.
Chopra, C.S. Chaudhary and Kapil Dev Narain Singh.
(vi) Charge No. 6.
1058\. The charge No. 6 has been framed against accused Santoshanand that
between June and July 1974 in Delhi, he was in possession of three live hand
grenades and he intended by means thereof to endanger human life or cause
injuries to the property or to enable any other person by means thereof to
endanger life or cause serious injuries to property and thereby committed an
offence under Section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908.
1059\. This court has already returned a finding with regard to the possession
of the explosive substance by Santoshanand, which he handed over to PW-2. The
consistent testimony of PW-2 corroborated by the testimony of PW-13, PW-15,
PW-24, PW-25, PW-42 and PW- 138 along with the material objects seized i.e.
Ex.P-7, P-11 to P-13 and documentary evidence Ex.PW-15/A and Ex.PW-15/B,
clearly establishes that the accused Santoshanand had handed over a letter and
a packet to PW-2 to be handed over to Budheshawaranand (since CBI Vs.
Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara)
Page No. 1086 dead) at Bhagalpur between June 1974 to First Week of July 1974.
Accordingly, in the first week of July 1974, PW-2 carried and delivered the
same to deceased Budheshawaranand at Bhagalpur. The photograph of
Budheshawaranand Ex.P-3 is not demolished nor questioned by the accused.
Rather, the same was got confirmed by the accused while cross-examining PW-151
at page No. 3825. According to the testimony of PW-2, the same was delivered
and as instructed by the deceased Budheshawaranand, PW-2 and the deceased went
to Khanjarpur (Bhagalpur) to a Maqbara on 13.07.1974, when suddenly the police
party appeared and PW-2 escaped. Deceased Budheshawaranand, who kept the
letter and packet in his bag (P-7), was arrested by the police and the police
had seized the packet. The police found three hand grenades in the packet.
When sent for scientific examination of the seized material in the packet, the
same were revealed to contain hand grenades made of TNT (falling under Special
category explosive substance as defined in Section 2 (b) of the said Act),
which is an explosive substance and could endanger human life on explosion or
cause injury to the property. The evidence of PW- 138 and the material objects
seized at Ex.P-11 to Ex.P-13 establishes all the ingredients for the offence
under Section 4 of the Explosive Substance Act, 1908. This court could not
find anything to disbelieve the version of the prosecution from the entire
material evidence presented before this court. Therefore, this charge is
proved against CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th December
2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1087 accused Santoshanand. Thus, accused
Santoshanand is held guilty for the aforesaid offence also.
(vii) Charge No. 7.
1060\. The instant charge is against accused Sudevanand accusing him of
possessing a live hand grenade on 02.01.1975 at Samastipur and he intended by
means thereof to endanger human life or to cause injury to property or to
enable any other person by means thereof to endanger life or cause serious
injury to property and thus committed an offence under Section 4 of the
Explosive Substance Act, 1908.
1061\. While appreciating the entire evidence qua the accusations under the
different chapters, this court has found reliable evidence from the testimony
of PW-2 that it was Sudevanand who hurled a bomb/hand grenade on 02.01.1975 at
the Rostrum injuring several persons out of them three succumbed to their
injuries including the Railway Minister. The splinters have pierced into the
bodies of the injured.
1062\. The scientific report proved through PW-51 and his report at Ex.PW-51/A
and the material objects like the splinters and the remnants of the shell of
the hand grenade, which were exhibited as Mark "A to E" and referred in the
report, inexorably proved that the hand grenade contained TNT (Tri-Nitro-
Toluene)-(falling under Special category explosive substance as defined in
Section 2 (b) of the CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel Decided on 08th
December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1088 said Act)-which is an explosive
substance and could endanger human life on explosion or cause injury to the
property. Thus the evidence presented establishes that this charge is proved
against accused Sudevanand. Hence, he is held guilty for the aforesaid offence
also.
(viii) Charge No. 8.
1063\. The present charge has been framed against accused Santoshanand that on
02.01.1975, while at Samastipur, he was in possession of three live hand
grenades and he intended by means thereof to endanger human life or to cause
injury to property or enable any other person by means thereof to endanger
life or cause serious injury to property and thereby committed an offence
punishable under Section 4 of The Explosive Substance Act, 1908.
1064\. I have already held while answering the charge under the same provision
as against accused Sudevanand, who having been given the explosive substance
by the above accused Santoshanand, containing TNT (Tri-Nitro-Toluene)-(falling
under Special category explosive substance as defined in Section 2 (b) of the
said Act)-which is an explosive substance and could endanger human life on
explosion or cause injury to the property, this court has found overwhelming
evidence of the above accused possessing three hand grenades, which had passed
on to the hands of PW-2 and Sudevanand and one retained by him (Santoshanand)
and further one given to Sudevanand, which exploded upon its hurling by him,
there is enough material to hold that CBI Vs. Santoshanand etc. Vinod Goel
Decided on 08th December 2014. D&SJ (Shahdara) Page No. 1089 this accused
possessed the explosive substance of special category on the date of incident
i.e. 02.01.1975. Thus, this court hold Santoshanand guilty for the offence
under Section 4 of Explosive Substance Act, 1908 since all the ingredients for
the said offence gets satisfied upon close scrutiny of the entire evidence on
record.
