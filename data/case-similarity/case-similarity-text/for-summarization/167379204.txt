1961 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') for the assessment year 2009-10 on
the following grounds :
Transfer Pricing [Rs. 80,430,576]
1\. On facts and in law, the order under section 143(3) read with section 144C
of the Act passed by the Ld. AO is void-ab-initio and infructuous and is
liable to be quashed as the said order is in violation of section 144C(10),
(13), (5) of the Act, in so far, as it is contradictory to and ignorant of the
directions issued by the Hon'ble DRP.
SIM Card Assembly Segment [Rs. 69,819,061]  ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 2
2\. On facts and in law, the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 12(1),
New Delhi ("Ld. AO") [along with the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax,
Transfer Pricing Officer - 1(2), New Delhi ("the Ld. TPO") - under reference
from the Ld. AO] erred in determining and the Hon'ble Dispute Resolution Panel
("Hon'ble DRP") erred in partly confirming the addition of Rs. 69,819,061 to
the total income of the Appellant on account of the difference in arm's length
price of the international transactions pertaining to SIM card assembly
segment of the Appellant.
3\. Without prejudice to Ground 1, on the facts and in law, the order of the
Ld. AO is erroneous to the extent of not incorporating the binding directions
of the Hon'ble DRP that the adjustment should be restricted only to the
transactions with the AEs which results in relief of Rs. 33,095,760, while
finalizing the order section 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act.
4\. On the facts and in law, the Ld. TPO, Ld. AO and Hon'ble DRP erred in
computing the profit margin of whole SIM card segment thereby contravening the
provisions of Rule 10B( 1 )(e)(i) of the Rules which necessitate the
computation of net profit margin realised by the Appellant only from its
international transactions with the AEs.
5\. On facts and in law, the Ld. TPO, Ld. AO and the Hon'ble DRP erred in
applying the profit margin of comparable companies to that of the Appellant
without taking into account economic & commercial reasons and factual data to
support the losses incurred in the SIM card assembly segment.
6\. On the facts and in law, the Ld. TPO, the Ld. AO and the Hon'ble DRP
grossly erred in not allowing appropriate adjustments in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 10B(l)(e)(iii) and 10B(3) of the Rules to account for
difference in working capital employed between the Appellant and the
comparable companies selected by the Ld. TPO.
Software Development Segment [Rs. 10,611,515]
7\. On facts and in law, the Ld. TPO, Ld. AO erred in determining and the
Hon'ble DRP erred in partly confirming the addition of Rs. 10,611,515 to the
total income of the Appellant on account of the difference in the arm's length
price of international transactions pertaining to software development
segment.
ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 3
8\. Without prejudice to Ground 1, on the facts and in law, the order of the
Ld. AO is erroneous to the extent of not incorporating the binding directions
of the Hon'ble DRP that the working capital adjustment under Rule 10B(l)(e)
for the purpose of determination of the ALP and the corrected margins of the
comparables should be considered which results in relief of Rs. 2,158,799
while finalizing the order section 143(3) read with section 144C of the Act.
9\. On facts and in law, the Ld. AO/ Ld. TPO erred in violating the provisions
of Rule 10B(2) of the Rules by rejecting certain comparable companies
identified by the Appellant in its TP documentation using arbitrary reasons/
filters.
10\. On facts and in law, the Ld. AO/ Ld. TPO erred in violating the
provisions of Rule 10B(2) by introducing new companies without considering the
differences in the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by
such companies vis- a-vis the Appellant, thereby resorting to cherry picking
of comparables.
10.1 Infosys Technologies Ltd. (Functionally not comparable to the Appellant)
10.2 Sonata Software Limited (Failing filter of related party transactions to
total sales applied by the Ld. TPO) 10.3 Kals Information Systems Limited
(Failing filter of employee cost to total sales applied by the Ld. TPO and
Functionally not comparable to the Appellant) 10.4 Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.
(Functionally not comparable to the Appellant and a super normal profit making
company) 10.5 Comp-U-Leam India Ltd. (Functionally not comparable to the
Appellant)
11\. On the facts and in law, the Ld. TPO and Ld. AO erred in not allowing a
risk adjustment to the Appellant, thereby contravening the provisions of Rule
10B( 1 )(e)(iii) of the Rules.
Use of Multiple Year Data
12\. On facts and in law the Ld. TPO, Ld. AO and the Hon'ble DRP erred in
using the data for the current year (i.e. financial year 2008-09) which was
not contemporaneous and which was not available in the public domain at the
time of preparing the TP documentation by the Appellant, thereby grossly
misinterpreting the requirement of 'contemporaneous' data in the Rules to
necessarily imply current year data, thereby breaching the principles of
natural  ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 4 justice and 'impossibility of performance'.
13\. On facts and in law, the Ld. AO erred in determining and the Hon'ble DRP
erred in confirming the adjustment of Rs. 3,475,925 to the total income of the
Appellant on account of disallowance of payment of export commission under
section 40(a)(ia) of the Act.
14\. On facts and in law, the Ld. AO and the Hon'ble DRP erred in concluding
that the payment of export commission by the Appellant can be treated as
royalty/ fees for technical services under section 9(1) of the Act.
15\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. AO erred in
levying interest under section 234B and 234D of the Act.
16\. On facts and in law, the Ld. AO and the Hon'ble DRP erred on fact and in
law in initiating penalty under section 271(1 )(c) of the Act.
The Appellant vide its letter dated 17.09.2018 has raised additional grounds
which are as under:-
Ground 5.1: That the TPO/AO/DRP erred in confirming Karnataka Hybrid Micro
Devices Ltd. as a comparable without appreciating that the said comparable
does not fulfill the FAR test.
Ground 5.2: Without prejudice, even otherwise the said comparable was liable
to be rejected since the TPO himself in the preceding as well as subsequent
years has rejected the same as not being functionally comparable to the
Assessee.
2\. The brief facts of the case are that the appellant, Giesecke & Devrient
India Pvt. Ltd. is a company registered under the Companies Act,1956 and was
incorporated in 2001 as a 100 percent subsidiary of G&D GmBH with its
corporate office at Gurgaon. For the year under consideration the Appellant

Appellant during the year are as follows:-
              S. No.   NATURE OF TRANSACTION                     AMOUNT (In

                 5.    Purchase of Fixed Assets                  23,82,038/-
                 6.    Provision of Installation Services        20,12,946/-

                 8.    Commission Expenses                       70,98,795/-
                 9.    Interest on External Commercial           85,73,598/-
                       Borrowing
               10.     Repairs and Maintenance                   25,09,155/-
               11.     Other Expenses                            3,48,70,716/-
               12.     Reimbursement of Expenses                 72,39,704/-
              13.      Receipt of Software Services              27,74,401/-
              14.      Service Charges                           3,61,03,750/-
              15.      Gurantee Fee paid                         25,94,083/-
              16.      Recovery of Expenses                      28,03,221/-
The TPO for the above mentioned transactions picked up the transactions of
Assembly of SIM card segment and the software development segment proposing to
make adjustments to the same. For the software development segment the
Appellant declared an OP/OC of 13.14% and selected 24 comparables with an
average OP/OC of 14.23%. Hence the transaction was claimed to be at arm's
length. The TPO during the transfer pricing proceedings proceeded to reject 15
of the 24 comparables selected by the Appellant in its TP study and hence
accepted  ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 6 only 9 comparables from the list. Further,
the TPO added 6 additional comparables to the list and the average OP/OC of
the final 15 comparables was worked out at 22.43% thereby proposing an
adjustment of Rs.1,06,11,515/-.
2.1 In the Sim Card segment the Appellant declared its OP/OC of 17.40% whilst
selecting 5 comparables with an average OP/OC of 1.75% . It was submitted
before the TPO that the loss was owing to various circumstances such as
initial years of operation, high competition in the market, under utilisation
of capacities etc. The TPO accepted the benchmarking analysis of the Appellant
as it is. However, he refused to give adjustment with respect to low sales
realization due to falling prices, stiff market competition led to decrease in
prices of chips, under utilization of capacities and regulatory hurdles and
also proportionate adjustment between AE and non-AE transactions and
determined the adjustment being the difference between the margin of the
Appellant as opposed to the comparables at Rs.6,98,19,061/-.
2.2 The AO vide its Draft Order dated 21.02.2013 confirmed the additions as
proposed by the TPO. Additionally, the AO observed that the Appellant during
the impugned year had made commission payments to its AE namely Giesecke &
Devrient Egypt Services LLC ("G&D Egypt"). The Appellant submitted before the
AO that the said payments were in the nature of commission for forwarding of
orders and since the services were rendered outside India, being non
managerial/technical/consultancy in nature, the Appellant was not liable to
deduct tax at source and hence no disallowance U/S 40( a)(i) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 was warranted. The AO however disregarding the submissions of the
ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 7 Appellant, held that the payment of commission was in
the nature of "Fee for Technical Services" U/s. 9(1)(vii) of the Act and hence
made a disallowance of INR 34,75,925/- U/s. 40(a)(i) of the Act. Hence the
income of the Appellant was assessed as follows:-
              S.No.    Particulars                                AMOUNT (In
                                                                  INR)
                 1.    Income as Declared by the Assessee         14,69,61,812/-
                 2.    Additions :-
3\. Transfer Pricing adjustment . by the TPO 8,04,30,576/-
                 4.    Addition on account of Export              34,75,925/-
                       Commission
                 5.    Total Income                               23,08,68,313/-
                 6.    Rounded Off                                23,08,68,310/-
2.3 Aggrieved with the Draft Assessment Order, the Appellant preferred to file
objections before the Dispute Resolution Panel ("DRP"). The DRP vide its
directions dated 24.12.2013 gave partial relief to the Appellant as follows:-
> (i). Contentions against exclusion of comparables in the software segment
> were rejected.
> (ii). Plea for working capital adjustment was granted
> (iii). Plea regarding correction of margins was acceded to
> (iv). Capacity adjustment for the SIM card segment was rejected.
> (v). Proportionate adjustment in the SIM card segment allowed
> (vi). Corporate tax addition u/s 40(a)(i) was confirmed.
2.4 The AO passed the Final Assessment Order dated 16.01.2014 confirming the
additions as made in the Draft Order dated 21.02.2013 in complete disregard to
the DRP Directions dated 24.12.2013. The TPO thereafter passed an appeal
effect order dated 27.02.2014 whereby the adjustments in the TP segments were
recalculated as under:-
              S.No.    Descriptions                               Adjustment (In
                                                                  INR)
                                                                  ITA No. 2544/Del/2014   8

Aggrieved with the Final Assessment Order dated 16.01.2014 the Appellant
preferred an appeal before the Tribunal.
2.5. Thereafter, the Appellant filed a rectification application before the
TPO pointing out certain calculation errors in the margins of the final set of
comparables for the Software Development Segment. The TPO vide its order dated
22.06.2015 acceded to the Appellant's request and recomputed the margins as
follows thereby reducing the adjustment to Rs.87,93,902/-

3\. The Appellant is challenging inclusion of 5 comparables by TPO out of the
above mentioned 15 comparables namely Bodhtree Consulting Ltd., Comp-U- Learn
Tech Ltd., Infosys Ltd., Kals Information Systems Ltd. and Sonata Software
Ltd. on the following written submissions made before us :
BODHTREE CONSULTING LIMITED {"Bodhtree"} 11.1. Bodhtree was rejected by the
Appellant in its TP Study as not being functionally comparable to the
functional profile of the Appellant. The TPO however disregarded the
contentions of the Appellant and held that Bodhtree was primarily into
software development, hence added the same to the final list of comparables.
(Refer Pg. 23 to 24 of TPO Order).
The said comparable was objected to before the DRP (Refer Pg. 82 to 85 of
Objections), however, the DRP rejected the Appellant's contentions for
exclusion of Bodhtree. (Refer Pg.14 of DRP Directions).
The appellant is challenging the exclusion of Bodhtree as a comparable on the
following points :-
20.1 Functionally Different - It is respectfully submitted that Bodhtree is an
end to end service provider which provides IT Consulting and product
engineering services including business activities like data warehousing and
data management. It has only one segment namely software development, however,
under one umbrella it is providing open and end to end web solutions, off
shoring data management, data warehousing, software consultancy, design and
development of solutions whilst utilising the latest technology. (Refer Pg. 12
of Annual Report).
ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 10
20.2 Insufficient Segmental Details - Bodhtree deals in wide array of services
and products there is no segmental data of revenue or costs between the said
services. (Refer Pg. 28 of the Annual Report) 20.3 Abnormal Growth -
Additionally, Bodhtree during the impugned year had an abnormal growth of 67%
in comparison to the preceding year. (Refer Pg. 1 of the Annual Report) 20.4
Bodhtree follows a different revenue recognition model as compared to the
Appellant.
20.5 Additionally, it is pertinent to mention that the said comparable has
been rejected as not being functionally comparable to the Appellant in the
Appellant's own case for the preceding year i.e. AY 2008-09 by this Hon'ble
Tribunal vide its order dated 23.08.2018. Hence, there being no change in the
profile of Bodhtree between AY 2008-09 and 2009- 10, the said comparable is
liable to be rejected.(Refer Pg. 15 to 20 of the Tribunal Order)
21\. The Appellant would also like to place reliance on the co-ordinate
bench's decision in the case of Cadence Design Systems (India) Pvt. Ltd. v
DCIT, ITA No. 2074/Del12014 (for the same assessment year, i.e., AY 2009-10)
wherein this Hon'ble Tribunal has categorically held that Bodhtree being an
end to end service provider dealing in software products as well, cannot be
held to be functionally comparable to a captive software development company.
The relevant extract of the findings of Tribunal in the case of Cadence Design
(supra) is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:
"6.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant findings
given in the impugned order as well as the material referred to before us. As
discussed earlier, the assessee under the provision of software research and
development services carries out R&D services for its AE for the development
of software products to its CDS utilizing R&D technology of CDS only. CDS
specifies R&D services to be performed; products to be developed or used; time
line for completion and specific result to be achieved. The entire
conceptualizing of the marketing strategy for sales of its products and
services, securing of orders of its products are done by CDS and not by the
assessee. The assessee company is purely a 'captive service provider' and does
not undertake any kind of marketing or development functions.
Conceptualization of services and determination of exact scope of work, which
is to be performed by the assessee, is responsibility of CDS. Even the quality
control, testing of the products is all done by CDS. Now, if we analyze the
functions of the assessee, which is purely R&D being a captive unit vis-a-vis
the functions of Bodhtree, we find that this company is into IT consulting and
product engineering service and has a wide array of business activities like
data warehousing and data management. It has only one segment namely, software
development and being a software solution company, it is engaged in providing
open and end-to-end web solutions, off shores data management and data
consultancy design and development solution. Such functions, though may be
said to be carried out by the AE i.e. Cadence, but it cannot be said that
similar functions have been performed by the assessee. Even on the risk
analysis, the comparability fails as assessee is purely risk mitigated company
as discussed above. We find that there are catena of decisions of various
Benches of the Tribunal like in case of Cisco Systems India (P.) Ltd. v.
ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 11
Dy. CIT [20I4} 66 SOT 82150 taxmann.com 280 (Bang.), wherein it was held that
this company is rendering software business of developing software products
and is providing open and end-to-end web solution, software consultancy and
design and development of software and the same cannot be held to be
comparable with the companies, which are purely into software development
services and not into software products. Apart from that, in the case of
Fiserv India (P.) Ltd. (supra), this comparable has been excluded after
considering various decisions of the Tribunal. Coming to the arguments of the
ld. Sr. D.R. that during the course of search analysis, the assessee too has
chosen the companies by adopting search criteria of company into 'software
products' and therefore, the assessee now is precluded from making a
distinction that software product companies should be excluded. In our
opinion, such a contention of the ld. Sr. DR cannot be accepted, because
selection of comparables by using any search criteria is one of the process of
shortlisting the companies by applying various quantitative and qualitative
filters in the wide array of companies in the data. Once in the search
process, certain companies are thrown in the search result, then it is
incumbent that deep FAR analysis is to be done so as to carry out proper
comparability analysis with the tested party so as to benchmark and arrive at
a proper Arm's Length Price. If at the functional level, it is shown that
functions performed by the assessee is entirely different from the functions
carried out by the comparable companies, or it does 8 found comparable either
under risk analysis or assets deployed, then such comparable companies should
not be excluded from comparability analysis. Accordingly, we hold that
Bodhtree cannot be included as comparable for benchmarking the assessee 's
margin. "
22\. Reliance is also placed on the following decisions for the same
Assessment Year (AY 2009-10) wherein Bodhtree has been excluded as not being
functionally comparable to a captive software developer.
i. Finserv India Pvt. Ltd. v ITa, [2015] 60 taxmann.com 48 (Delhi-Trib) ii GE
Convertam EDC Pvt. Ltd. v ACIT, [2017] 79 taxmann.com 408 (Chennai- Trib) iii.
OSI Systems Pvt. Ltd. v DCIT, [2016] 66 taxmann.com 109 (Hyderabad-Trib) iv.
Syncheron Technologies Pvt. Ltd. v JCIT, [2016] 71 taxmann.com 245 (Pune-
Trib)
23\. Hence, it is prayed that in view of the above arguments, Bodhtree cannot
be taken as a comparable and is liable to be rejected.
4\. On the other hand, the ld. DR submitted that Bodhtree Consulting Ltd. is a
suitable comparable which has been rightly selected by the TPO. From the
annual report of the above company, it is clear that the company is engaged
only in the Software Development Services. In the notes to accounts, the
auditor has categorically mentioned at Sl. No.5 under the head 'segment
information' that there is only one segment, i.e., software development
services. The profit and loss  ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 12 account shows that the
company has shown revenue from sales only. Inviting our attention to the
decision of Tribunal in the case of assessee for assessment year 2008-09, the
ld. DR submitted that the Tribunal though excluded the above comparable from
the final set of comparables, but has also referred to the decision of Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of Saxo India (ITA No. 682/2016, wherein it has
been categorically observed that a company engaged in providing software
Development service cannot be regarded as a fit comparable to the company
engaged in providing both software development and software product services.
In the present case, the assessee as well as Bodhtree Consulting Ltd.
(Bodhtree) are found engaged only in one segment, i.e., software development
Services. Nowhere in the annual report or director's report of M/s. Bodhtree,
is it mentioned that the company is in the development of products. The
confusion has arisen only on account of the narration mentioned in the Revenue
segment which has been described as local sales and export sales. The sale
here denotes income from software development services. Further, there is no
opening and closing stock inventory of any product in the final accounts of
the comparable, namely, Bodhtree. Further, ld. DR submitted that in the
present case, assessee is also engaged in complex software development
services which includes web services, e-business, communication infrastructure
(page 357 of the paper book). Further, assessee supports in the entire gamut
of Government solution business unit, which includes capturing data for ID
specific identifying characteristics to delivery of personalized cards as per
page 390 of the paper book which is basically entire gamut of IT services and
IT scrutiny systems. Further, in the TP study, there is no separation of role
of assessee and its AE for discharging overall function. Still further, as per
page 110 of the paper book, which is part of the transfer pricing study, there
is no separate role of the assessee mentioned under the head software
development services so as to ascertain what specific services  ITA No.
2544/Del/2014 13 are performed by the assessee in the overall functions of the
group. Therefore, this comparable has rightly been included by the TPO.
5\. After hearing both the sides and perusing the entire materials available
on record, we observe that the segment-wise and product-wise performance of
Bodhtree as mentioned in director's report is as under :
> "Bodhtree has only one segment, namely, software development. Being a
> software solutions company, it is engaged in providing open and end-to-end
> web solutions, Offshoring data management, data warehousing, software
> consultancy, design and development of solutions, using the latest
> technologies.
On perusal of Profit and loss account of Bodhtree, the Revenue is generating
only from sales which is basically service income in absence of any supporting
figures in respect of separate software product. Further, there is no opening
and closing figures for any software product/purchase of software product. In
the entire annual report and Director's report, there is no mention of
development of product by this company. In the director's report Annexure-3
page No. 12, it is stated that there is only one segment, namely, software
development and the company is only a software solution company and is engaged
in providing open and end-to-end web solutions. This statement further
supports that the company is not engaged in developing separate software
product but only in providing software development services and solutions.
5\. As far as veracity of software services provided by Bodhtree, the transfer
pricing study alongwith annexures have been perused. Transfer pricing
memorandum is contained from page 100 to 330 of the paper book as per
annexures of the paper book. On page No. 110 under the software development
ITA No. 2544/Del/2014 14 segment (para 1.3), there is no specific function
mentioned in the said segment performed by the assessee vis a vis the group
functions. For the sake of clarity, the functions under the software
development services as contained in para 1.3 are reproduced as under :
> 1.3. Software development During FY 2008-09, G&D India has provided software
> development services to G&D GmbH, Giesecke & Devrient America Inc. ("G&D
> America") and Giesecke & Devrient Asia Pte. Ltd. ("G&D Asia").

Further, on pages 164 & 165 of the paper book para 4.3.1, the functions under
the software development are reproduced as under :
