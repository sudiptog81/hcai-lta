INDU MALHOTRA, J.
Leave granted.
1\. The issue which arises for consideration in the present Civil Appeals is
whether the Department ought to have permitted the assessee companies to file
the revised Income Tax Returns for the Assessment Year 2016­2017 after the
In the present case, the predecessor companies/transferor companies have been
succeeded by the Appellants/transferee companies who have taken over their
business along with all assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc.

Department is required to assess the  26 income of the Appellants after taking
into account the revised Returns filed after amalgamation of the companies.
11\. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we find that the learned Single
Judge had rightly allowed the Writ Petitions. We accordingly set aside the
impugned Judgment and Order dated 04.07.0219 passed by the learned Division
Bench, and restore the judgment dated 30.04.2019 passed by the learned Single
Judge. Accordingly, the Civil Appeals are allowed.

2016­2017 after taking into account the Schemes of Arrangement and

better realisation of the potential of their businesses, which would yield
beneficial results, and enhanced value creation for their shareholders, better

Rangam Securities & Holdings Ltd., Adhunik Cement Ltd., Adhunik MSP Cement

Companies”) and their respective shareholders and creditors.
                 The   Appointed       Date    of    the   Schemes    was
          01.01.2015,    and    would         come    into   effect   from
          30.10.2018.
    2.5   The    Transferor    and     Transferee      Companies      filed
Company Petitions under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 before
the Madras and Guwahati High Courts.
On the coming into force of the Companies Act, 2013, the Company Petitions
were transferred to NCLT, Chennai and NCLT, Guwahati.
2.6 The Schemes were duly approved and sanctioned by the NCLT, Guwahati vide
Orders dated 18.05.2017 and 30.08.2017. NCLT, Chennai sanctioned the Schemes
vide Orders dated 16.10.2017, 20.10.2017, 26.10.2017, 28.12.2017, 10.01.2018,
20.04.2018 and 01.05.2018.
2.7 The Appellants/ Transferee Companies manually filed revised Returns of
Income on 27.11.2018 with the Department after the Schemes were sanctioned and
4 approval was granted by the NCLT. The revised Returns were based on the
revised and modified computation of total income and tax liability of the
Transferor/Amalgamated Companies. In the revised Returns of Income, the
Appellant No.1 claimed losses in the current year to be carried forward
amounting to Rs.2,44,11,837/­; whereas Appellant No.2 claimed losses in the
current year, to be carried forward, amounting to Rs.1105,93,91,494/­.
2.8 The Appellants submit that the revised Returns were filed after the due
date for filing revised Returns of Income u/S. 139(5) for the Assessment Year
2016­ 2017 since the NCLT passed the final Order on 01.05.2018.
Consequentially, it was an impossibility to file the revised Returns before
the prescribed date of 31.03.2018.

2.11 On 04.12.2018, the Department issued a Notice under Section 143(2) of the
Income Tax Act to give effect to the approval of the Scheme.
2.12 On 05.12.2018, the Department recalled the Notice dated 04.12.2018 on the
ground that the Appellants had belatedly filed their revised Returns without
obtaining permission from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (“CBDT”) for
condonation of delay under Section  6 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
read with CBDT Circular No. 9/2015 dated 09.06.2015. 2.13 On 28.12.2018, the
Department passed an Assessment Order u/S. 143(3) of the Income Tax Act,
stating that in view of the Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation, the notice
issued under Section 143(2), and the assessment proceedings for A.Y. 2016­2017
had become infructuous with respect to Appellant No.2.
2.14 The Appellants filed Writ Petitions before the Madras High Court praying
for quashing of the Order dated 05.12.2018, and for a direction to the
Department to complete the assessment for A.Y. 2015­2016 and A.Y. 2016­2017
after taking into account the revised Income Tax Returns filed on 27.11.2018,
as well as the Orders dated 20.04.2018 and 01.05.2018 passed by the NCLT,
Chennai approving the Schemes of Arrangement and Amalgamation.
2.15 The learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court vide common Judgment
and Order dated 30.04.2019 allowed the Writ Petitions filed by the Appellants,
and  7 quashed the Order dated 05.12.2018 passed by the Department. The Single
Judge held that Clause 64 (c) of the Scheme enabled the Appellants to file
their revised Returns of Income beyond the prescribed period under the Income
Tax Act. The Department could not override an approved Scheme of Arrangement
and Amalgamation, which has statutory force, by rejecting the revised Returns
of Income filed by the Appellants as being invalid.
The Department did not object to the Schemes notified under Section 230(5) of
the Companies Act, 2013\. Sections 139(5) and 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act
as well as the Circular No. 9/2015 issued by the CBDT are not applicable to a
case where a revised Return of Income has been filed pursuant to a Scheme of
Arrangement and Amalgamation, which has been approved and sanctioned by the
NCLT.
The Department was not justified in rejecting the revised Return of Income on
the ground that it had been filed manually, instead of being filed
electronically. Rule 12(3) of the Income Tax Rules  8 requires filing of
revised Returns of Income electronically, which is not applicable where
revised Returns of Income are filed by the assessee pursuant to a Scheme of
Arrangement and Amalgamation approved and sanctioned by the NCLT.
Accordingly, the Single Judge directed the Department to receive the revised
Returns filed pursuant to the approval of the Schemes of Arrangement and
Amalgamation by the NCLT, Chennai and complete the assessment for A.Y.
2015­2016 and A.Y. 2016­2017 in accordance with law within a period of 12
weeks.
2.16 The Department filed Writ Appeals under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent
Act challenging the Judgment & Order dated 30.04.2019 passed by the Single
Judge.
A Division Bench of the Madras High Court vide the impugned Judgment dated
04.07.2019 allowed the Writ Appeals, and reversed the Judgment of the Single
Judge. The Division Bench directed the Appellants to comply with the procedure
for filing belated revised Returns of Income, and held that Clause 64 of the
9 Scheme can only be construed as an enabling clause.
It cannot be inferred that the Department agreed to consider the revised
Returns of Income, irrespective of whether it complies with the procedural and
statutory requirements under the Income Tax Act, merely because Clause 64 of
the Scheme was not objected to the Department. The NCLT, while sanctioning the
Schemes, clarified that the Appellants would be required to approach the
relevant statutory authorities for obtaining necessary permissions and
compliances.
The Department did not consent to waive the procedures or statutory
requirements prescribed under S.139(5) and 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act in
respect of filing of revised Returns of Income. 2.17 The Department vide
letter dated 11.07.2019 informed the Appellants that in case they fail to file
the revised Returns before the expiry of the limitation period prescribed for
completion of assessment in accordance with Explanation 1 to Section 153 r.w.
Proviso (1) i.e. 60 days from the date of the impugned Judgment, the  10
assessment for A.Y. 2016­2017 would be conducted on the basis of the original
Returns filed by them. 2.18 The Appellants made a representation on 22.07.2019
stating that subsequent to the approval and sanction of the Scheme of
Arrangement and Amalgamation, the income of the Transferor companies merged in
the hands of the Appellants w.e.f. 01.01.2015, being the Appointed Date as the
“date of succession” under S. 170 of the Act. Accordingly, the Appellants
requested the Department to give cognizance to the Scheme, and accept the
revised Return of Income filed on 27.11.2018, while completing the assessment
for the A.Y. 2016­2017.
2.19 The Department informed the Appellants on 05.08.2019 that since the
revised Returns were not in accordance with Sections 139(5), 139(3) of the Act
r.w. Rule 12(3) of the Income Tax Rules, 1962, the revised Returns were
invalid, and could not be considered in view of the procedural requirement
under Section 119(2)(b) read with CBDT Circular No. 9 of 2015.  11 2.20
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the Division Bench, the Appellants have filed the
present common Civil Appeals on 09.08.2019 before this Court.
3\. We have heard Mr. S. Ganesh, Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellants,
and Mr. Arijit Prasad, Senior Advocate appearing for the Department. We have
perused the pleadings and written submissions filed by the parties.
4\. Discussion and Analysis 4.1 A perusal of Clause 63 (c) of the Scheme of

Holdings Ltd., Appellant No.1 and Appellant No.2 and their respective
shareholders and creditors, as approved and sanctioned by the NCLT, Chennai
vide Orders dated 16.10.2017, 20.10.2017 and Corrigendum dated 26.10.2017
shows that the Appellants were entitled to file revised Returns of Income,
after the prescribed time limit for filing or revising the returns had lapsed,
without incurring any liability on account of interest, penalty or any other
sum.
12 Clause 63 (c) of the said Scheme is set out hereinbelow for ready

other statutory returns, if required, credit for advance tax paid, tax

2 as may be required consequent to implementation of this Scheme and where
necessary to give effect to this Scheme, even if the prescribed time limits or

of interest, penalty or any other sum. DPL shall have the right to claim
refunds, tax credits, set­ offs and/or adjustments relating to its income or
transactions entered into by it by virtue of this Scheme with effect from
Appointed Date I. The taxes or duties paid by, for, or on behalf of the
Amalgamating Undertaking 2 relating to the period on or after Appointed Date I
shall be deemed to be the taxes or duties paid by DPL, and accordingly DPL
shall be entitled to claim credit or refund for such taxes or duties.”
[emphasis supplied] 4.2 Similarly, Clause 64 (c) of the Scheme of Arrangement
and Amalgamation between Odisha Cement Ltd., OCL India Limited, Dalmia Cement
East Ltd., Shri Rangam Securities & Holdings Ltd., Dalmia Bharat Cement
Holdings Ltd., Appellant No.1 and Appellant No.2 and their respective
shareholders and creditors, as approved and sanctioned by the NCLT, Chennai on
20.04.2018 and 01.05.2018, shows that provisions were incorporated to enable
the Appellants to file  14 revised Returns even after the prescribed time
limit for filing or revising such Returns had lapsed, without incurring any
liability on account of interest, penalty or any other sum.
Clause 64 (c) of the said Scheme is extracted hereinbelow for ready reference:

the Department, or other regulators or authorities, likely to be affected by
the Schemes.
4.7 As a consequence, when the companies merged and amalgamated into another,
the amalgamating companies lost their separate identity and character, and
ceased to exist upon the approval of the Schemes of Amalgamation.2 4.8 Every
scheme of arrangement and amalgamation must provide for an Appointed Date. The
Appointed Date is the date on which the assets and liabilities of the
transferor company vest in, and stand transferred to the transferee company.
The Schemes come into effect from the Appointed Date, unless modified by the
Court.
This Court in Marshall Sons & Co. (India) Ltd. v. ITO3 held that where the
Court does not prescribe any specific date but merely sanctions the scheme 2
Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi v. Maruti Suzuki India Limited,
Civil Appeal No 5409 of 2019, decided on 25.07.2019 3 Marshall Sons & Co.
(India) Ltd. v. ITO (1997) 2 SCC 302  19 presented, it would follow that the
date of amalgamation/date of transfer is the date specified in the scheme as
“the transfer date”. It was held that:
> “14. Every scheme of amalgamation has to necessarily provide a date with
> effect from which the amalgamation/transfer shall take place. The scheme
> concerned herein does so provide viz. 1-1-1982. It is true that while
> sanctioning the scheme, it is open to the Court to modify the said date and
> prescribe such date of amalgamation/transfer as it thinks appropriate in the
> facts and circumstances of the case. If the Court so specifies a date, there

> Transferee Companies. But that may not be an insuperable problem inasmuch as
> assessment can always be made, on the available material, even without a
> balance-sheet. In certain cases, best judgment assessment may also be

> Thereafter, they entered into Schemes of Arrangement and Amalgamation with 9
> Transferor Companies in 2017.
> The Schemes were finally sanctioned and approved by the NCLT, Chennai vide
> final orders dated 20.04.2018  21 and 01.05.2018. The Appointed Date as per

5\. The counsel appearing for the Department relied on Section 139(5) and
119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act r.w. Circular No.9 of 2015 issued by the CBDT
to contend that the  22 Appellant ought to have made an application for
condonation of delay, and sought permission from the CBDT, before filing the
revised Returns beyond the statutory period of 31.03.2018. The Appellants
having belatedly filed their revised Returns on 27.11.2018, which was beyond
the due date of 31.03.2018 for A.Y. 2016­2017, the assessment could only be
done on the basis of the original Returns filed by the Appellants.
6\. Section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, as it stood at the relevant time,
makes it clear that where an assessee furnishes a return under sub­section (1)
or sub­section (4) of Section 139, and later discovers an omission or mistake
therein, he may furnish a revised Return at any time before the expiry of one
year from the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of
the assessment, whichever is earlier.
Section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act is set out hereinunder for ready
reference:
> “139(5). If any person, having furnished a return under sub­section (1) or
> sub­section (4) of Section 139, discovers an omission or wrong statement
> therein, he may furnish a revised return at any time before the expiry of
> one year  23 from the end of the relevant assessment year or before the
> completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier”
7\. In our view, this provision is not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case since the revised Returns were not filed on
account of an omission or wrong statement or omission contained therein. The
delay occurred on account of the time taken to obtain sanction of the Schemes
of Arrangement and Amalgamation from the NCLT.
8\. In the facts of the present case, it was an impossibility for the assessee
companies to have filed the revised Returns of Income for the A.Y. 2016­2017
before the due date of 31.03.2018, since the NCLT had passed the last orders
granting approval and sanction of the Schemes only on 22.04.2018 and
01.05.2018.
9\. The counsel appearing for the Department submitted that the Appellants
ought to have made a representation to the Board under Section 119(2)(b) of
the Income Tax Act for condonation of delay while filing the revised Returns.
A perusal of Section 119(2)(b) shows that it is applicable in cases of genuine
hardship to admit an application, claim any exemption, deduction, refund or
any other relief under this  24 Act after the expiry of the stipulated period
under the Income Tax Act.
Section 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act is reproduced hereinunder for ready
reference:
“119. Instructions to subordinate authorities.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power,— …
(b) the Board may, if it considers it desirable or expedient so to do for
avoiding genuine hardship in any case or class of cases, by general or special
order, authorise any income­tax authority, not being a Commissioner (Appeals)
to admit an application or claim for any exemption, deduction, refund or any
other relief under this Act after the expiry of the period specified by or
under this Act for making such application or claim and deal with the same on
merits in accordance with law.” On a plain reading of Section 119(2)(b), we
find that this provision would not be applicable where an assessee has
restructured their business, and filed a revised Return of Income with the
prior approval and sanction of the NCLT, without any objection from the
Department.
Rules of procedure have been construed to be the handmaiden of justice.4 The
purpose of assessment proceedings is to assess the tax liability of an
assessee correctly in accordance with law.5 4 Kailash v Nankhu (2005) 4 SCC
480; State of Punjab v Shamlal Murari (1976) 1 SCC 719 5 National Thermal
Power Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, (1997) 7 SCC 489  25
10\. Section 170(1) of the Income Tax Act, provides that the successor of an
assessee shall be assessed in respect of the income of the previous year after
the date of succession. S.170(1) of the Income Tax Act provides as under:
> “170. Succession to business otherwise than on death. (1) Where a person
> carrying on any business or profession (such person hereinafter in this
> section being referred to as the predecessor) has been succeeded therein by
> any other person (hereinafter in this section referred to as the successor)
> who continues to carry on that business or profession,­
> (a) the predecessor shall be assessed in respect of the income of the
> previous year in which the succession took place up to the date of
> succession;
(b) the successor shall be assessed in respect of the income of the previous
year after the date of succession.” Sub­section (1) of Section 170 makes it
clear that it is incumbent upon the Department to assess the total income of
the successor in respect of the previous assessment year after the date of
succession.
In the present case, the predecessor companies/transferor companies have been
succeeded by the Appellants/transferee companies who have taken over their
business along with all assets, liabilities, profits and losses etc.
In view of the provisions of Section 170(1) of the Income Tax Act, the
Department is required to assess the  26 income of the Appellants after taking
into account the revised Returns filed after amalgamation of the companies.
11\. In light of the aforesaid discussion, we find that the learned Single
Judge had rightly allowed the Writ Petitions. We accordingly set aside the
impugned Judgment and Order dated 04.07.0219 passed by the learned Division
Bench, and restore the judgment dated 30.04.2019 passed by the learned Single
Judge. Accordingly, the Civil Appeals are allowed.
The Department is directed to receive the revised Returns of Income for A.Y.
2016­2017 filed by the Appellants, and complete the assessment for A.Y.
2016­2017 after taking into account the Schemes of Arrangement and
Amalgamation as sanctioned by the NCLT.
12\. Pending Applications, if any, are accordingly disposed of. Ordered
accordingly.
