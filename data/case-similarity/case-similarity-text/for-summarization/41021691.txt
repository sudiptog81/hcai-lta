of the Order forwarded to:
1\. The Appellant
2\. The Respondent.
PER C.N. PRASAD (JM)
1\. All these appeals are filed by the assessee against different orders of
the Ld. Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) [hereinafter in short
"Ld.CIT(A)"] for various Assessment Years from 2007-08 to 2013-14, in
sustaining the action of the Assessing Officer in reopening the assessment
made u/s. 143 r.w.s 147 of the Act, and sustaining the addition to the extent
of 8% of the purchases treated as non-genuine.
2
ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems
2\. In all these appeals assessee challenged the order of the Ld. CIT(A) in
re-opening the assessment by issue of notice u/s. 148 as well as making
addition towards non-genuine purchases.
3\. Ld. Counsel for the assessee refereing to reasons for re-opening of
assessment for the A.Y. 2007-08 submits that, assessment was reopened only
based on the information received from DIT(Inv.) that there was a search and
seizure action in the case of Bhanwarlal Jain Group and based on the search
materials and the statements of various persons in Bhanwarlal Jain Group it
came to light that they have provided only accommodation entries through
benami concerns, they have admitted in the statements recorded u/s. 132(4)
that they have only provided bogus entries and therefore based on this
information the Assessing Officer observing that the list of beneficiaries of
accommodation entries pertains to the assessee and therefore he believed that
income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment.
4\. The Ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that, there is no independent
recording of satisfaction by the Assessing Officer and he has simply relied on
the investigation report and the statements of Bhanwarlal Jain Group that they
have provided accommodation entries and assessee has obtained entries from
those concerns without making any enquiry and recording any independent
satisfaction that the income had escaped  3 ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s.
Simoni Gems assessment. Ld. Counsel for the assessee further referring to Page
No. 16 of the Paper Book which is the letter dated 24.02.2015 issued by the
Assessing Officer disposed of the objections for issue of notice u/s. 148 of
the Act submits that the Assessing Officer admits that the information
provided by the investigation wing DIT is entailed into invoking the
provisions of section 147 of the Act. Therefore, he submits that there is no
formation of belief by the Assessing Officer that income had escaped
assessment except relying on the report of DIT(Inv.). Placing reliance on the
following decisions the Ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that since
there is no independent recording of satisfaction by the Assessing Officer and
the reasons were recorded based on the borrowed satisfaction the re-opening of
assessment is bad in law.
         a.    PCIT v. Shodiman Investments (P) Ltd., [93 taxmann.com]
         b.    NV Power Renewable Pvt Ltd, v. DCIT [94 taxmann.com 29 (Bom)]
         c.    Harikishan Sunderlal Virmani v. DCIT [394 ITR 146 (Guj)]
         d.    PCIT v. Meenakshi Overseas Pvt. Ltd., [395 ITR 677 (Del.)]
         e.    ACIT v. Dhariya Construction Co. [328 ITR 515]
5\. Coming to the merits of the case, Ld. Counsel for the assessee submits
that in the course of the re-assessment proceedings notice u/s.133(6) were
issued to the suppliers and the suppliers have confirmed that they have
supplied materials, affidavits were filed by the suppliers confirming the
supply of materials, payments were made through account payee cheques,
suppliers have issued proper invoices, stocks were tallied. All this
information though furnished before the Assessing Officer  4 ITA NOs. 747 to
752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems without making any sort of enquiry with the
suppliers, merely relying on the investigation report and the statements of
the persons of Bhanwarlal Jain Group came to the conclusion that assessee has
received only accommodation entries from these concerns without supply of
materials.
Therefore, he has estimated the income element from such purchases @8%. Ld.
Counsel for the assessee submits that, since the parties have confirmed by
filing account confirmations and affidavits, stocks were tallied, payments
were made through account payee cheques, sales were accepted, there is no
justification in treating the purchases as non-genuine from these parties.
6\. Ld. Counsel for the assessee submits that the only reason why the addition
was made is that the parties were not produced. He submits that simply because
the parties were not produced the purchases cannot be treated as non-genuine.
Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the
case of CIT v. Nikunj Eximp [216 Taxman.com 171].
7\. Ld. Counsel for the assessee further submitted that, assessee was not
provided with the statements of the persons deposed from Bhanwarlal Jain Group
that no supplies have been made to the assessee though asked for. In the
absence of providing statements and providing cross  5 ITA NOs. 747 to
752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems examination the statements cannot be used
against the assessee for treating the supplies as non-genuine.
8\. Ld. DR vehemently supported the orders of the Authorities below.
In so far as the re-opening of assessment is concerned, Ld. DR submits that
the search by investigation authorities is subsequent event which came to
light that the assessee obtained only accommodation entries from Bhanwarlal
Jain Group companies and therefore the Assessing Officer has rightly re-opened
the assessment. Coming to the merits of the case Ld. DR submits that the
assessee has not proved that the stocks were tallied and in fact there were no
stocks found and thus lower authorities have rightly estimated the profit
element @8% as the assessee has obtained only accommodation bills from the
concerns of Bhanwarlal Jain Group and might have purchased the materials in
grey market.
9\. Heard rival submissions, perused the orders of the authorities below, the
materials placed before me and the case laws relied on. I find from the
material before me, that the suppliers have responded to the notice issued
u/s. 133(6) of the Act, filed the account confirmations, filed affidavits
deposing that they have supplied the materials, delivery of goods, payments
were made through Account payee cheques and none of these evidences were
considered by the Assessing Officer. No further investigation has been made by
the Assessing Officer to verify the veracity  6 ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018
M/s. Simoni Gems of these documents. The statements recorded by the
investigation wing from the persons belonging to Bhanwarlal Jain Group were
also not provided to the assessee in spite of request. Therefore, in the
absence of any sort of enquiry by the Assessing Officer in my opinion the
purchases made by the assessee cannot be treated as non-genuine. The
statements on which the Assessing Officer relied on to make the disallowance
were not provided to assessee and no opportunity was given to cross examine
them and this makes the assessment bad in law for violation of principles of
natural justice. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Andaman Timber
Industries v. CCE in Civil Appeal No. 4228 of 2006 dated 02.09.2015 held that
when the assessment was made on the basis of the statements recorded from
third parties and if those statements were not provided nor cross examination
was given to the assessee, the assessment order made based on those statement
is bad in law.
Following the above Hon'ble Supreme Court decision, the Ahmadabad Bench of
ITAT in the case of Smt. Sunita Jain & Smt Rachna Sachin Jain v. ITO in
ITA.No. 501 & 502/AHD/2016 dated 09.03.2017 quashed the assessment on
identical situation.
10\. Almost identical issue came up before the Division Bench in the case of
M/s. Sejal Exports (India) v. DCIT in ITA.Nos. 3854, 3855, 3856,  7 ITA NOs.
747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems 3857, 3858, 3859 & 3864 /MUM/2017 dated
04.07.2018, wherein the Coordinate Bench held as under: -
"13. We have heard the rival submissions, perused the orders of the
authorities below. Assessing Officer required the assessee to prove the
genuineness of the purchases, since the information was received from
DGIT(Investigation), Mumbai that assessee was one of the beneficiaries of
bogus purchase bills issued by the companies which were maintained by
Bhanwarlal Jain Group as there was search in the case of Bhanwarlal Jain
Group. The Revenue came to know that the Bhanwarlal Jain Group was issuing the
accommodation entries to various parties through different entities. Assessee
submitted copies of invoices, ledger confirmations, bank statements etc., and
contended that the purchases are genuine. However, the Assessing Officer
rejecting the explanations and submissions of the assessee and ignoring the
evidences furnished in the form of invoices, ledger confirmation, bank
statements estimated the profit element in the purchases at the rate at which
the assessee has declared the Gross Profit for the relevant Assessment Year
and the Gross Profit rate stood at about 7% in all Assessment Years. On appeal
the Ld.CIT(A) considering the submissions of the assessee and evidences on
record concluded that the purchases have been actually made but not from whom
these are claimed to have been made and instead they have been purchased from
gray market without proper billing or documentation. Therefore, only the
profit element embedded therein needs to be brought to tax. He concluded that
the profit element estimated by the Assessing Officer at around 7.33% which is
the Gross Profit declared by the assessee for the Assessment Year 2007-08 is
excessive and unreasonable. He considered fair and reasonable to estimate the
profit margin embedded in such purchases @2% observing as under: -
> "6.3.1. I have considered the submissions of the appellant and perused the
> materials available on record including the judicial decisions relied upon
> by the appellant. The point for determination is whether the AO is justified

ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems 6.3.2 A perusal of the relevant
invoices reveals that out of aforesaid 13 concerns of Bhanwarlal Jain Group,
many concerns were having common addresses, as brought out in the table below:
-
              Sr.No.    Name                               Address
              1.        Ankita Exports,             3-M, Ambika Darshan,
                        Milan & Co.                 Moti Kadia Sheri,
                        Parvati Exports             Saiyadpura, Surat - 395 003
              2         Laxmi Diamond               204, Vaibhav Chamber,
                        Marvin Enterprise           Rughnathpura Main Road,
                        Prime Star                  Surat - 395 003
              3.        Mukti Exports               407, Devratna Apartment,
                        Mohit Enterprises           Rampure Main Road,
                        Pakanj Exports              Surat - 395 003
                        Pushpak Gems
                        Rajan Diamonds
It is also noticed that the invoices of almost all 13 concerns were prepared
on the computer in the same format having the same font type as well as (font)
size. It is pertinent to mention that while 1% VAT is leviable on such
transactions in Mumbai/ Maharashtra, the diamond sector in Surat/Gujarat is
exempted from payment of VAT. Thus, there is a saving of 1% VAT involved in
procuring (accommodation) purchase bills of cut and polished diamonds from
parties like the aforesaid concerns based in Surat. I am unable to accept the
appellant's plea that there is nothing in support of cash purchases of goods
from the grey market, because these transactions take place in secret and no
direct evidence in this regard is generally available. It is well-established
that such matters have to be considered in the light of surrounding
circumstances, normal course of human conduct and preponderance of
probabilities. However, it is pertinent to mention that the fact that the
appellant was one of the beneficiaries of the accommodation entries obtained
from entry providers operating in Mumbai came to light only during the course
of search and seizure actions carried out in the case of Shri Bhanwarlal Jain
Group. The purchases of cut and polished diamonds shown to have been made from
aforesaid 13 parties cannot be regarded as genuine merely because the
appellant was not related to the suppliers or because the GP rate shown by the
appellant was reasonable or satisfactory and had been accepted in the past.
However, since the appellant had furnished copies of account confirmations,
purchase invoices, etc. and quantitative details of the principal items of raw
materials and finished goods in carat were available in the tax audit report,
I am in agreement with the AO's finding that the cut and polished diamonds
were purchased by the appellant from the grey market and to give this the
colour of genuine purchases, bogus accommodation bills were obtained from
aforesaid 13 concerns. It deserves to be noted that the AO had not rejected
the books of account of the appellant because he had no material to doubt the
genuineness of sales/ exports made by the appellant.
6.3.3 It is now well-established that in a case where the purchases have been
actually made but not from the parties from whom these are claimed to have
been made and instead may have been purchased from grey market without proper
billing or documentation, only the profit element embedded therein needs to be
brought to tax. The estimation of rate of profit must necessarily vary with
the nature of business and no uniform yardstick can be adopted. It is well-
known that if  9 ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems purchases are
made from open market without insisting on the genuine bills, the suppliers
may be willing to sell those products at a much lower rate as compared to the
rate which they may charge in case the dealer has to give a genuine sale
invoice in respect of that sale and supply the goods. It is a matter of common
knowledge that there is bound to be a substantial difference between the
purchase price of unaccounted material and rate of purchase of accounted for
goods due to various factors such as saving on account of sales-tax and other
taxes and duties leviable in respect of manufacture or sale of goods in
question and substantial saving in the income-tax to suppliers in respect of
income from sale of unaccounted goods etc. In these circumstances, the
diamonds in the grey market are always cheaper than the diamonds sourced from
the genuine dealer, because there is an element of discount in case of instant
cash purchase. Therefore, the AO has correctly concluded that an addition is
required to be made in case of the appellant so as to bring to tax the profit
element embedded in such purchases.
6.3.4 Coming now to the estimation of profit margin @7.33% by the AO in the
present case, I find merit in the appellant's plea that the extra profit of
7.33% estimated by the AO is excessive and unreasonable. This is so because
the AO has not given any basis or justification for adopting the profit
element at 7.33%. In this connection, it is pertinent to note that purchase of
cut and polished diamonds from open market is made mainly to save 1% VAT
levied thereon and in addition, the buyer gets the benefit of lower rate/cash
discount. In these circumstances, the addition of extra profit @7.33% of
purchases from aforesaid concerns cannot at all be said to be justified. In
view of this position, it is considered fair and reasonable to estimate the
profit margin embedded in such purchases at 2% of the purchase value recorded
in the books of account. Since the appellant has shown purchases to the tune
of Rs.16,74,69,611/-, the profit element involved therein @2% of the purchase
value will come to Rs.33,49,392/- as against Rs.1,22,75,522/- worked out by
the AO. Thus, the appellant gets relief of Rs.89,26,130/- (Rs.1,22,75,522-
Rs.33,49,392) on this count. Ground No.3 of the present appeal is accordingly
allowed to the extent indicated above."
14\. On a perusal of the order of the Ld.CIT(A) and the findings thereon with
reference to the submissions and evidences thereon, we find that Ld.CIT(A)
completely ignored the confirmations filed by the parties in response to
notices issued u/s. 133(6) of the Act by the Assessing Officer. The parties
have confirmed by submitting the copy of ledger account, copy of sales bills,
copy of bank statement where the payments were made through cheques and copy
of Income Tax Returns reflecting the sale in their Books of Accounts.
Ld.CIT(A) lost sight of these evidences which is crucial in these appeals to
decide the genuineness of the purchases. When the parties confirmed that they
have supplied the goods to the assessee and recorded the sales in their Books
of Accounts, we fail to understand how the Ld.CIT(A) concluded that the
purchases have been actually made but not from these parties but they have
been made from gray market without proper billing or documentation. In our
considered view, when the parties have confirmed the transaction by filing
necessary details as was done in this case the purchases cannot be treated as
non-genuine.
15\. Almost identical issue came up in the case of the M/s. Vama International
v. I.T.O (supra) wherein the Assessing Officer treated the whole purchases are
non-genuine, Ld.CIT(A) estimated the profit element from that purchases @12.5%
the Coordinate Bench considering the evidences on record deleted the
estimation made by the Ld.CIT(A) observing as under: -
10
ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems "16. We have heard the rival
submissions, perused the orders of the authorities below. In this case the
assessments were reopened based on the information from the
DGIT(Investigations), Mumbai that assessee is a beneficiary from the entities
operated by Shri Bhanwarlal Jain wherein the search took place and it was
found that Shri Bhanwarlal Jain is providing only accommodation entries and
there were no actual sale transactions. Assessing Officer observed that the
assessee could not prove the movement of goods from the suppliers to the
assessee. In the absence of delivery challans and based on the statements of
Bhanwarlal Jain that they have provided only accommodation bills, the
Assessing Officer has concluded that the assessee has obtained only bogus
bills and assessee might have purchased goods in gray market. The Assessing
Officer estimated the Gross Profit Margin on such purchases at 12.5% for the
Assessment Years 2012-13 and 2013-
14\. For the Assessment Year 2011-12 the entire purchases were treated as non-
genuine. The Ld.CIT(A) taking note of the submissions of the assessee as well
as the averments of the Assessing Officer and various case laws estimated the
profit element from these purchases at 12.5% for all the Assessment Years
2011-12 to 2013-14. The Ld.CIT(A) in his order observed as under:
> "11. I have carefully gone through the assessment order passed by the
> Assessing Officer and the written submissions of the appellant on the issue.
> I have also considered various case laws relied upon by the appellant. My

Daksh Diamonds specifically stated that it had made bogus sales to the
appellant. The purchase invoices, payments to the parties through cheques and
closing stock inventory submitted by the appellant are certain important
evidences regarding the purchases made by the appellant that cannot be set
aside summarily. Therefore, the conclusion drawn regarding  11 ITA NOs. 747 to
752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems the purchases made from M/s.Daksh Diamonds being
entirely bogus, is not justified.
15\. In this regard, the ratio was laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of
Bombay in the case of CIT v. NikunjEximp Enterprises (P.) Ltd., is very
relevant, wherein it was held that --
> "When the assessee have filed letter of confirmations of the suppliers, Bank
> statements highlighting the payment entries through account payee cheque,
> copies of invoices, stock reconciliation statements before the AO; and
> merely because the suppliers did not appear before the AO, one cannot
> conclude that the purchases were not made by the assesses. The AO cannot
> disallow the purchases on the basis of suspicion because the suppliers were
> not produced before them."
16\. The facts and circumstances as outlined above, clearly suggest that the
purchases by the appellant from M/s.Daksh Diamonds cannot be doubted but a
major flaw in these transactions is the unverifiable nature of transactions of
these purchases from M/s. Daksh Diamonds as it was not found available at the
given address. Thus the purchase prices shown on the invoices are not
subjected to verification and as such it was difficult to establish the
correctness of the purchase prices paid for the materials purchased from them.
Such verification of the sale price shown on the invoices/bills was necessary
to ascertain the correctness of the profits shown by the appellant for the
period under consideration. This verification was also vital to determine as
to whether the purchase prices shown on the bills/invoices, are as per
prevailing market prices of the materials purchased and to ascertain that the
price paid for the materials purchased from M/s.Daksh Diamonds is not over
invoiced. In the absence of any such verification of the correctness of the
price paid for the materials purchased by the appellant, the purchase price
paid as mentioned on the invoices/bills cannot be accepted as the correct
price paid for the goods purchased from M/s.Daksh Diamonds. In view of the
same, the possibility of over-invoicing of the materials purchased to reduce
the profit, 'cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the gross profit rate shown by
the appellant for the year under consideration cannot be relied upon. In the
circumstances, the correct approach in such transactions would be to estimate
the additional benefit or profit earned on these purchases and not to disallow
the entire purchases from M/s. Daksh Diamonds. The disallowance of the entire
amount of purchases from M/s.Daksh Diamonds would not be logical and would
amount to travesty of justice. In my view either the purchases from above
mentioned party are over invoiced or the purchases were actually made but not
from the said party from which it was claimed to have been made and instead
may have been purchased from grey market without proper billing or
documentation.
17\. As of now the issue of bogus purchases has been much discussed and
debated by the various courts and tribunals. In many judicial pronouncements
on the issue, the courts have taken a consistent view that in case of non-
existent parties from whom the purchases are shown to have been made, only
pert of such purchases can be disallowed,  12 ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018
M/s. Simoni Gems particularly in the cases where the corresponding sales are
not doubted. Alternatively, the profit embedded in such sales against the
alleged bogus purchase, can only be brought to tax.
18\. In the case of CIT-1 Vs Simit P. Sheth, ITA no. 553 of 2012, order dated
16.01.2013, while deciding a similar issue the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat
has held that: -
> "We are broadly in agreement with the reasoning adopted by the Commissioner
> (Appeals) with respect to the nature of disputed purchases of steel. It may

19\. Similarly while dealing with an identical issue, in the case of CIT v.
Bholanath Poly Fab (Purchase) ltd. ITA.No.No. 63 of 2012, in the order dated
23/10/2012, the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat has held as under: -
> "We are of the opinion that the Tribunal committed no error. Whether the
> purchases themselves were bogus or whether the parties from whom such
> purchases were allegedly made were bogus is essentially a question of fact.
> The Tribunal having examined the evidence on record came to the conclusion
> that the assesses did purchase the cloth and sell the finished goods. In  13
> ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems that view of the matter, as
> natural corollary, not the entire amount covered under such purchase, but
> the profit element embedded therein would be subject to tax. This was the
> view of this court in the case of Sanjay Oilcake Industries v. CIT (2009]
> 316 ITR 274 (Guj). Such decision is also followed by this court in a
> judgment dated August 16,2011, in Tax Appeal No. 679 of 2010 in the case of
> CIT v. KishorAmrutlal Patel. In the result, tax appeal is dismissed."
> 20\. In view of the facts and circumstances and the judicial pronouncements
> cited above; what can be disallowed or taxed in the instant case of the
> alleged bogus purchases is only the excess profit element embedded in such
> purchases shown to have been made from M/s.Daksh Diamonds. The appellant has
> not placed any evidence on record that the goods were purchased from the

> from other parties to establish that the purchases from M/s.Daksh Diamonds
> in question was at par with the purchases made from other parties during the

17\. As could be seen from the above the Ld.CIT(A) did not agree with the
Assessing Officer that the purchases by the assessee are bogus/non-genuine.
However, the Ld.CIT(A) observed that purchases made cannot be doubted and
there is a major flaw in these transactions is the unverifiable nature of
transactions as the parities are not found available in the given address.
However, we see that the parties have responded in these cases for the notices
issued u/s. 133(6) of the Act, they have filed Ledger Account of the assessee
in their books of accounts, Copies of Sales Invoices issued by them, their
Bank statements reflecting the payments made by the assessee to them, Copies
of acknowledgement of Income- tax Returns filed by them, Audited Profit & Loss
A/c and Balance Sheets to show that the transactions of sales made to the
assessee are genuine. On a careful consideration of the submissions made by
the assessee, we find considerable force in the submissions not to treat the
purchases made by the assessee from the parties as non-genuine/bogus.
14
ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems
18\. The reason for treating these purchases as non-genuine /bogus is the
statements given by Bhanwarlal Jain group and non-submission of delivery
invoices by the assessee. It is the submission of the assessee that the
statements given by Bhanwarlal Jain group have been retracted by them
subsequently and there is a practice of hand delivery of such precious and
light weighing materials like Diamonds is prevailing in the industry.
Therefore, no adverse conclusion can be drawn merely due to absence of
documents proving deliveries. The analysis furnished before us on the Gross
Profit margin shown by the assessee also suggest that assessee is consistent
in showing overall Gross Profit around 6% in these Assessment Years. The
average Gross Profit shown by the assessee stood at 6.04% for these Assessment
Years. Therefore even if we go by the submissions of the Ld.DR that the profit
element should be estimated at 6% as per the CBDT Circular the assessee has
already shown 6.04% of overall Gross Profit during these three Assessment
Years. The disallowance/estimation of profit on purchases by treating them as
bogus cannot be made only on the statements recorded from third parties,
especially when those parties have responded to the notice issued u/s.133(6)
of the Act by filing all necessary documents to prove that they have made
sales to the assessee. It is also the submission of the assessee that none of
the impugned parties have been declared as Hawala dealers or suspicious
dealers by the Sales Tax Department and the genuineness of the purchases have
been doubted merely on the basis of the statement given by the Bhanwarlal Jain
group. The assessee has furnished all necessary evidence to prove the
genuineness of the purchases, the parties have also responded to the notices
u/s. 133(6) of the Act by filing necessary evidence as to prove that the
purchases are genuine. Thus the assessee discharged the onus to prove the
genuineness of the transactions made by the assessee from the impugned
parties. The Assessing Officer completely failed to make further enquiries in
these cases. The documents furnished by the supplier of the goods have not
been disproved by the Assessing Officer in these matters.
19\. We also find that the Coordinate Bench in the case of Indo Unique Trading
Pvt Ltd. v. DCIT in ITA.No. 6341/Mum/2016 considered almost an identical
situation wherein the suppliers have responded to the notices issued u/s.
133(6) of the Act and confirmed the transaction by filing various details
before the Assessing Officer, in such circumstances the Coordinate Bench
accepted the contentions of the assessee that the purchases cannot be treated
as bogus simply relying on the statements in the case of Bhanwarlal Jain
group. While holding so the Coordinate Bench observed as under: -
> "10. We have heard rival contentions and perused the record. We notice that
> the assessing officer has reopened the assessment for the second time after
> expiry of four years from the end of the assessment year, on the basis of
> information received from the investigation wing about the bogus nature of
> transactions entered by Shri Bhanwarlal Jain group. Even though the AO has
> mentioned the reasons that there was failure on the part of the assessee to

> has not specified the manner of failure.
> 11\. On the contrary, we notice that the assessee has proved the genuineness
> of purchases by obtaining confirmation letters in the form of affidavits
> from all the suppliers. The AO has done independent enquiry during the
> course of assessment proceedings by issuing notices u/s  15 ITA NOs. 747 to
> 752/MUM/2018 M/s. Simoni Gems 133(6) of the Act to all the suppliers. We

> they did not mention about the nature of transactions. In our view, the said

> the sales effected by them to the assessee. Further they have also verified
> and signed the ledger account copies as available in the books of account.
> When the suppliers confirm that the transactions of sales made by them to

> those documents.
> 12\. In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the view that the
> assessee has duly discharged the burden to prove the genuineness of
> purchases. On the contrary, the AO has simply relied upon the report given

> 20\. In view of what is discussed above, we are of the view that the
> assessee has duly discharged its burden of proving the genuineness of the

> simple relied on the statements of third party to treat the purchases as

> us."
16\. As could be seen from the above, the facts in the case of the assessee
and also the decision referred to above are almost identical. The parties have
confirmed by filing replies to notices u/s. 133(6) of the Act along with the
ledger account of the assessee in their Books of Accounts, copies of sales
invoices issued by them to the assessee, thereby statements reflecting
payments made by the assessee to them, copy of acknowledgment of Income Tax
Returns filed by them to show that the transaction of sales made to the
assessee are genuine. We also find that the Gross Profit margin shown by the
assessee is ranging in between 7.02% to 7.62% consistently. Further, the
disallowance / estimation of profit of purchases by treating them as bogus
cannot be made only on the statements recorded from third parties, especially
when the suppliers have responded to the notice u/s. 133(6) of the Act and
filed all the necessary documents to prove the genuineness of the purchases
made by the assessee. Thus the grounds raised by the assessee on merits are
allowed. As we have allowed the appeals  16 ITA NOs. 747 to 752/MUM/2018 M/s.
Simoni Gems of the assessee on merits for the reasons and discussions made
therein, the Revenue's appeals are dismissed."
11\. In view of the above discussions and following the above decision, I hold
that there shall not be any disallowance towards non-genuine purchases for all
the Assessment years in appeal and direct the Assessing Officer to delete the
addition/disallowance made towards non-genuine purchases. As I have deleted
the disallowance/addition on merits the grounds raised challenging the
reopening of assessment is not adjudicated.
12\. In the result, appeals of the assessee are allowed as indicated above.
