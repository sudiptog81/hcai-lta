                                      ORDER
Per Bench This bunch of appeals is by Revenue against various companies of
Reliance (ADAG) group, hereinafter referred as "Reliance" for the sake of
convenience, which include Reliance Communications Ltd., Reliance Telecom Ltd.
Reliance BPO Ltd., Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd. The last four
in the group listed above are appeals by M/s. Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, USA
(referred as Lucent) against Revenue. In the course of hearing the learned
CIT-DR requested for clubbing the four appeals of M/s Lucent as they are
interrelated. In the Revenue appeals issue is whether the payments made for
acquiring software from No- resident companies is taxable under the provisions
of IT Act. The same issue is also in the Lucent appeals. In addition issue of
PE, tax credit and levy of interest were other issues in Lucent appeals. Since
common issues are involved in these appeals they are heard together.
2\. Briefly stated, Reliance Infocomm Ltd., now known as Reliance
Communications Ltd. wanted to establish wireless telecommunications network in
India. As a part of that it has entered into a Wireless Network General Terms
and Conditions contract and Wireless Software contract dated 31.07.2002 with
Lucent Technologies Hindustan Pvt. Ltd. (LTHPL), an Indian company of M/s.
Lucent group, USA. Wireless software Assignment and Assumption agreement dated
05.08.2002 with LTHPL and Lucent Technologies GRL LLC (LTGL) USA towards
supply of software required for telecom network. When Reliance placed first
supply orders for software for 4 Reliance and Lucent Group an amount of
US$11,06,56,855, it made applications under section 195(2) before DDIT-2(1)
Mumbai requesting payment for purchase of software without deduction of tax at
source. It was Reliance's contention that it was for purchase of software and
LTGL has no PE in India and as per DTAA between India and USA, the amount paid
is not taxable in India. AO after examining the details of agreements held
that the assessee was getting only license to use the software and is in the
nature of royalty, taxable at 20% in India under the provisions of Income tax
Act 1961. Not only in the case of Lucent, Reliance also similarly placed
orders with various other suppliers of telecom software in other countries and
sought no deduction certificates on similar contentions. AO passed similar
orders in all the cases where Reliance was to remit the monies over a period
of time. After deducting tax as directed by the AO, Reliance however preferred
appeals before the Ld.CIT(A) as per the then existing provisions of section
248 of the IT Act. The learned CIT(A), vide his orders, held that the amounts
paid cannot be considered as royalty as Reliance purchased 'goods' which is a
copyrighted article and so, since the seller do not have PE in India the
amount is not taxable. Accordingly, he gave relief to Reliance. The Revenue is
aggrieved on these orders. The lead order of the AO and CIT(A) pertains to ITA
No. 837/Mum/2007 in which the AO' order under section 195(2) dated 12.03.2003
was considered by the CIT(A) in his appeal No. CITA XXXI/DDIT (IT) 2(1)/IT -
448/02-03/06-07 dated 26.10.2006. It was admitted that the facts are more or
less similar to the above appeal and main arguments were rendered in this
appeal.
3\. Since main agreement was with M/s. LTHPL, India and software was supplied
by M/s. Lucent USA, the AO initiated proceedings under section 147 to tax the
amounts and the orders were passed holding that the amounts are taxable in
India. This order was passed, commonly for four assessment years, which was
approved by the DRP as per the provisions of section 144C(13) of the I.T. Act.
Therefore, Lucent preferred direct appeals to ITAT on these orders of AO.
5 Reliance and Lucent Group
4\. Revenue was represented by Shri Parag Vyas, Special Council and Reliance
was represented by Sr. Counsel Shri J.D. Mistry whereas Lucent was represented
by Sr. Counsel Sri. P.J. Pardiwala. Revenue has placed various agreements from
page No. 1 to 1697 and case law from 1968 to 2129 in three volumes. Reliance
also placed relevant documents on record. Lucent has placed a volume
containing pages 1 to 622. The cases were heard over a period of time and
various clarifications sought were also placed on record.
5\. For the sake of convenience, the appeal in ITA No. 837/Mum/2007 and
Lucent's appeals were dealt with in detail. The arguments and findings are
mutatis mutandis apply to other cases also, which will be dealt with later.
ITA No. 837/Mum/2007
6\. In this Revenue appeal, Revenue has raised the following grounds: -
> "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
> CIT(A) erred in deciding that the Assessing Officer was not justified in
> directing to deduct Tax at Source u/s. 195 of the I.T. Act.
> 2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
> CIT(A) erred in holding that no income accrues to M/s. Lucent Technologies
> GRL LLC in India against the payment of US$ 11,06,56,855/- for the supply of
> software for use in the Reliance Telecom Network.
> 3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
> CIT(A) failed to appreciate that the payment for obtaining computer software
> is in the nature of 'Royalty' as defined by the DTAA and liable for taxation
> in India."
7\. Reliance Infocomm Limited, (Respondent), now known as Reliance
communications Ltd had entered into a Wireless Software Contract and Wireless
Network General Terms and conditions Contract (GTC) dated 31.07.2002 with
Lucent technologies Hindustan Private Ltd (LTHPL) and another Wireless
Software Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated 05.08.2002 with LTHPL and
Lucent Technologies GRL LLC (LTGL), USA for purchase of certain software for
the purposes of operation of wireless telecommunication network. Initially,
Reliance placed seven purchase orders 6 Reliance and Lucent Group of total
amount of US$ 11,06,56,855/-. The Reliance filed a applications u/s.195(2)
before the DDIT(IT)-2(1), Mumbai (AO) requesting for payment for purchase of
software without deduction of tax at source u/s.195. The AO did not allow the
petition and held that the tax has to be deducted at source. The Reliance has
mentioned that LTGL is a company resident in USA and does not have any PE in
India. Therefore provisions of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between
India and USA (DTAA) would be available to LTGL, since section 90(2) provides
that the provisions of Income-tax Act would apply only if they are more
beneficial to LTGL and has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Azadi Bachao Andolan & Another (2003) 263 ITR 706. The AO has
rejected the claim and has given various reasons for rejection.
8\. The AO examined para-15.l of the Wireless Software Assignment and
Assumption Agreement and para-3.1 of the same agreement and held that the
Reliance was getting only license to use the software and no other title or
interest in the software is being transferred to the Reliance. The Reliance
had claimed that the license in perpetuity amounts to sale. The AO rejected it
and held that the license remains only a license, irrespective of the period
involved and further in this fast paced technological progress, rate of
obsolescence in software is very high and therefore life of software is
limited. The title and proprietary rights would remain with LTGL and the
Reliance would not be the owner of the software but would, be only a licensee
for the use of or the right to use of the copyright. The AO thereafter
examined the provisions of Income-tax Act and held after examining the
copyright act and section 9(1)(vi) that licensing, is 'only merely for the use
of software and therefore payment made for the license to use software amounts
to royalty within the meaning of section 9(1)(vi).
9\. The AO also held that the software can be termed as patent or invention
and also scientific work and therefore payment for the use of software would
be covered under these categories also as per section 9(1)(vi). The AO also
held that software can be, termed a secret formula or process. The AO further
referred to the circular of Government of Singapore 7 Reliance and Lucent
Group exempting shrink-wrap software from withholding tax as per Circular
29.12.2000. The AO referred to the US IRS Ruling and held that the payment for
software even for a fixed or unlimited period would constitute royalty. The AO
referred to the ruling of Australian Court wherein it was held that the amount
received in respect of computer software would not be royalty if it does not
give any rights in the copyright. The AO held that the software is an
intellectual property and falls in the category of copyrights, patents,
designs, trade marks, formula, process, commercial/scientific knowledge and
therefore consideration received for the license to use the software would
constitute royalty. The AO thereafter referred to definition, of royalty in
Article-12(3) of the DTAA and held that that payment for the license of
software, would also amounts to royalty within the provisions of DTAA. The AO
also relied upon the decision of AAR's ruling in the case of ABC Vs. RE (154
CTR 2.46). The AO relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in
the case of Leonhardt Andra Und Partner, Gmbh 249 ITR 418. The AO also relied
upon the decision of Hon'ble AAR in P.No.30/1999 reported in 238 ITR 296. The
AO held that the payment for purchase of software amounts to royalty within
the meaning of section 9(1)(vi) of the LT. Act and Article-12(3) of the DTAA.
He accordingly directed Reliance to deduct tax at 20% as Royalty. After
deducting tax, Reliance appealed to Ld CIT(A).
10\. Learned CIT(A), vide his order, has considered the issues as under:
> 2.14 I have carefully considered the arguments of the AR and I have also
> perused the records and gone through the arguments of the A0. It is seen
> that in the order u/s. 195(2), facts brought out are very scanty. The nature
> of the transactions and the purposes of acquisition of software has not been
> examined. The appellant was accordingly required to file copy of agreements,
> details of purchase bills, purposes of the software acquisition and the role
> of use of software with the hardware acquired. It is seen that LTHPL had
> entered into a Wireless Equipment Contract with the appellant dated
> 31.07.2002 for the supply of wireless equipment. Wireless Software Contract
> was entered into between LTHPL and the appellant on 31.07.2002 for the
> supply of wireless software. Wireless Services contract was entered into
> between LTHPL and the appellant on 31.07.2002 for the services in relation
> to Wireless Hardware Contract.
Wireless Network General Terms and Conditions Contract was entered into
between LTHPL and the appellant on 31.07.2002, which is 8 Reliance and Lucent
Group applicable to the Software Contract and the licensing of software to the
appellant. Wireless Software Assignment and Assumption Agreement (Assignment
Contract) was entered into between the appellant and LTHPL (assignor) on one
side and LTGL(assignee) on the other side. As per this contract LTHPL had
transferred or assigned to LTGL the Software Contract alongwith all rights and
entitlement. Section 1 & 2 of this Contract read as under:
"Section 1. Asignment and Assumption. Assignor hereby transfers and assigns to
the Assignee (i) the Software Contract, together with all rights,
entitlements, covenants and obligations of the Assignor under the Software
Contract, including but not limited to the supply and delivery of Software to
the Purchaser, and (ii) all rights, entitlements, covenants and obligations of
the Assignor under Section 15 of the General Terms and Conditions, relating to

software inducing upgrades of software has been supplied through the
corresponding purchase order of software. The AR has explained that Base
Transceiver Station (BTS) is installed at remote station whereas Flexent
Mobility Manager and Digital Cellular Switch software are installed at the
central location. The AR has accordingly explained that, for making the
hardware operational the corresponding software was purchase from LTGL and
installed on various locations namely Central Location and BTS.
2.18 With these facts the taxability of payment received by LTGL is examined.
Section 3.1 of the Wireless Network General Terms and Conditions Contract
dated 31.07.2002 provides for the total scope of the work namely, providing
hardware, software, equipment, communications circuits, networks, services to
the appellant by LTHPL. Section 3.1.1 reads as under:

2.18 Under the Assignment Contract, rights, entitlements, covenants and
obligations of LTHPL have passed to LTGL as per section-1 of the Assignment
Contract (already quoted above in para 2.14) Section-15.1 of the Wireless
Network General Terms and Conditions Contract reads as under:
"15.1 License Grants 15.1.1 Subject to the terms Of this Section 15, upon
delivery of Software, Vendor hereby grants to Reliance or Its Affiliates (and

operation and maintenance of the Wireless Reliance Network in the Territory
and the provision of relevant services in the Territory to Reliance's
customers. The Software shall be used in accordance with the relevant
Documents. 15.1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the licenses referred to in
Section 15.1.1 above are not intended to restrict the provision by Reliance of
telecommunications services 'between the Wireless Reliance Network and
customers outside the Territory via appropriate gateways either through
appropriate interconnect agreements that Reliance may enter into with other
operators or otherwise, provided, always that, unless otherwise agreed In
writing, Reliance and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to deploy or use
the Software acting as a carrier outside the Territory.
15.1.3 The aforementioned licenses set forth in Section 15.1.1 shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Software Licenses". Such Software Licenses
shall not be transferred, assigned, sublicensed by, or used by outsources of,
Reliance without Vendor's consent except with respect to (i) the sale of the
Wireless Reliance Network (or any relevant component thereof); (ii) the
financing of the Wireless Reliance Network (or any component thereof); or

writing to abide by all the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 15
and the Vendor is informed of the same in writing by Reliance and provided
further that the rights, transferred, assigned, sublicensed or granted to
outsourcees, as the case may be, shall be those reasonably necessary to
fulfill the commercial purposes of such transaction. The assignee or
sublicensee shall not be a direct competitor of the Vendor involved in the
manufacture of telecommunications equipment.
15.1.4 Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Documents, Reliance
shall use such Software only for the operation of the Wireless Reliance
Network, or, In the case where the Software is purchased by or on behalf of
Reliance Affiliates, for the operations of such Reliance Affiliates in the
Wireless Reliance Network. The Software Licenses grant Reliance or Reliance
Affiliates no right to and Reliance or Reliance Affiliates will not,
sublicense such Software or modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or
disassemble, or in any other manner decode Software furnished as object code
for any reason. Reliance and Reliance Affiliates shall not copy the Software,
including firmware except for the purposes of making a limited number of
archival copies (for backup use in operating and maintaining the Wireless
Reliance Network) in accordance with the Documentation and/ or the relevant
Agreement; or as otherwise authorized in writing by the, Vendor or as
otherwise set, out in the relevant Documentation. Except as provided below, no
license is granted to Reliance to use the Software outside of the Territory.
For the avoidance of doubt, the changing by Reliance or Reliance Affiliates of
tables and values in the Software, modification by Reliance and/or its
Affiliates of the Software by using the tools provided in or with the Software
or any modification, in accordance with and pursuant to the relevant
Documentation, shall not constitute 'modification' of the Software provided
always that Reliance may only change, amend or modify Software which is
designed for 'customer access' and to be so modified.
15.1.5 Reliance agrees that the Software, whether or not modified, and all
copies thereof made by Reliance, are owned by, and are copyrights of. Vendor,
its Subcontractors or its suppliers, as appropriate, and Reliance shall:
(a) ensure that all copies of the Software shall, upon any reproduction by
Reliance authorized by Vendor (where such authorization is required under the
Documents) and whether or not in the same form or format as such Software,
contain the same proprietary, confidentiality and copyright notices or legends
(if any) which appear an the Software provided pursuant hereto; and
(b) hold secret and not disclose the Software to any person, except 13
Reliance and Lucent Group to: (i) such of its employees, contractors, agents
representatives or Reliance Affiliates that are involved in the operation,
maintenance or management of the Wireless Reliance Network, and need to have
access thereto to fulfill their duties in such capacity, or (ii) other Persons
who need to use such Software to permit Integration of Equipment with other
products and software of other suppliers and customers; pro vided that such
persons agree, or are otherwise obligated, to hold secret and not disclose the
Software to the same extent as if they were subject to the Documents, and
provided further that if any such Person is a competitor of Vendor, involved
in the manufacture of communications equipment Vendor must approve (such
approval not to be unreasonably, withheld or delayed,) such use on a case-by-
case basis on commercially reasonable terms and such use shall be subject to
an appropriate non-disclosure agreement and
(c) when and if Reliance determines that it no longer needs the Software or if
Reliance's Software Licenses are cancelled or finally terminated in accordance
with and pursuant to the terms of this Section 15 of these General Terms,
return all copes (except for any required back-up or archival copies) of such
software to vendor or follow commercially reasonable written disposition
instructions provided by the Vendor. If the Vendor authorizes disposition by
erasure or destruction, Reliance shall remove from the medium on which
Software resides all electronic evidence of the Software, both in Its original
form and in all copies and derivations thereof, in such manner that prevents
subsequent recovery of such original or derived Software.
15.1.6 If as contemplated in Section 15.1.3. Reliance or its Affiliate(s):
(i) elects to transfer, assign or sublicense any Software in conjunction with
any portion of the Wireless Reliance Network to a third party, and where such
Software shall remain in place or be moved within the Territory and used for
substantially the same purpose as used by Reliance and where such third party
resides' in the Territory and Is approved by the Vendor (which approval shall
not be' unreasonably withheld or delayed); or
(ii) elects to transfer, assign or sublicense Software to a Reliance
Affiliate, in conjunction, with any portion of the Wireless Reliance Network.
Then Reliance may so transfer, assign or sublicense its Software Licenses for
the Software furnished under the Documents for use with such portion of the
Wireless, Reliance Network, without the payment of any additional fees or
monies of the Vendor. If, however, the Software Licenses for the Software
contains usage or per subscriber limits and/or the processor to be used by
transferee, assignee or sublicensee, as applicable, requires additional memory
or hard disk space to meet the transferee's, assignee's or sublicensee's new
or different requirements, then, unless otherwise agreed in writing, 14
Reliance and Lucent Group Reliance shall only transfer its existing rights to
the transferee and the transferee may be required to enter into an appropriate
agreement with the Vendor to cover requirements over and above the rights
which Reliance has already purchased and has transferred. The following
conditions shall apply to transfers, assignments or sublicenses and
relocations pursuant to this Section 15.1.6:
(a) the right to use of such Software may be transferred, assigned or
sublicensed, only together with the right to use in the environment under
which It is generally utilized.
(b) before any such Software. is transferred, assigned or sublicensed,
Reliance shall notify Vendor of such transfer, assignment or sublicense and
the transferee, assignee or sublicensee, as applicable, shall have agreed in
writing (a copy of which shall be provided to Vendor) to' keep the Software in
confidence and to corresponding conditions respecting possession and use of
Software as those imposed on Reliance under this Section 15; and
(c) the transferee, assignee or sublicensee, as applicable, shall have the
same right and obligations to Software warranty and Software maintenance for
such Software as the transferor, provided the transferee continues to pay the
fees, Including recurring fees, if any, associated with such Software warranty
or maintenance pursuant to the relevant Documents.
15.1.7 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 15 or in any of the
Documents. Reliance, or any successor to Reliance's title in the relevant
portion of the Wireless Reliance Network, shall have no right to transfer,
assign or sublicense, Software furnished by Vendor under the Documents without
the consent of Vendor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If Reliance or such successor elects to transfer or assign any
portion of the Wireless Reliance Network purchased under the Documents for
which it does not, under the Documents, have the right to transfer, assign or
sublicense related Software, Vendor agrees that, upon written request of the
transferee or assignee as applicable, of such portion of the Wireless Reliance
Network, or of Reliance or such successor, Vendor shall not unreasonably
refuse or fall to grant to the transferee, assignee or sublicensee, as
applicable, as license to use such Software within the Territory upon payment
by the transferee of a re-licensing fee to Vendor on commercially reasonable
terms.
15.1.8 The rights and obligations of Reliance under the Software Licenses,
shall survive the termination of all or any portion of the Documents,
regardless of the cause of term/nation, provided Reliance has met its material
obligations as set forth in this Section 15. In the event that Reliance falls
to pay applicable and undisputed Charges, Vendor may terminate Reliance's
right to use the, Software to which such Charges apply; provided that Vendor
has given written notice and details of such breach to Reliance and has
advised Reliance of its intention to terminate, and Reliance has failed to
make such payment 15 Reliance and Lucent Group within thirty (30) days from
Vendor's notice thereof. Such terminated rights shall be immediately
reinstated upon payment of all applicable license fees. In no event other than
as set forth in this Section 15.1.8 may Vendor terminate the Software Licenses
or, Reliance's right to use, the Software Notwithstanding any other provision
of the Documents, if there is a dispute hereunder, pending final resolution of
such dispute, all of Re/lance's rights under the Documents shall continue in
full force and effect, and Vendor will not terminate the Software Licenses,
and so long as Reliance continues to pay Vendor applicable fees, Vendor will
not terminate, suspend, interrupt or delay maintenance and support of the
Software.
2.19 Perusal of sectlon-15.1 of the agreement reveals that the appellant has
not received any right for transferring the software license or decompiling,
reverse engineering, or disassembling it. The appellant has also got no power
to decode the machine code of software. The appellant has got no power to make
copies of software except for backup purposes. From the section-15.1 of the
agreement, it is very apparent that the appellant has got the right to use
software for Its business or personal purposes and has obtained no other
rights. 2.20 The issue whether software Is goods or intellectual property has
been determined by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Tata Consultancy
Services Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (2004) 271 ITR
401\. It was argued on behalf of Andhra Pradesh Government that the computer
software is a intellectual property and providing it to anybody for
consideration results in royalty income being generated to the software
developer. Hon'ble Supreme Court examined the issue in detail and it was held
that software is an intellectual property so long as it remains with the
software developer. As soon as a copy of the software is produced and is
placed on a media, it becomes goods. Software on media is not different from
any book or canvas (in case of painting) or compact discs or cassettes in
respect of songs and pictures. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the software
and the media cannot be split up since the media has a little value. Hon'ble
Supreme Court has observed as under:
"A software programme may consist of various commands which enable the
computer to perform a designated task. The copyright in that programme may
remain with the originator of the programme. But the moment copies' are made
and marketed, it becomes goods, which are susceptible to sales tax. Even
intellectual property, once it is put on to a media, whether it be in the form
of books or canvas (In case of painting) or computer discs or cassettes, and
marketed would become "goods". We see no difference between a sale of a
software programme on a CD/floppy disc from a sale of music on a cassette/CD
or a sale of a film as a video cassette/CD. In all such cases, the
Intellectual property has been incorporated on a media for purposes of
transfer. Sale is not just of the media which by itself has very little value.
The software and the media cannot be split up. What the buyer purchases and
pays for is not the disc or the CD. As in the case of 16 Reliance and Lucent
Group paintings or books or music or films the buyer is purchasing the
intellectual property and not the media i.e. the paper or cassette or disc or
CD. Thus a transaction of sale of computer software is clearly a sale of
"goods" within the meaning of the term as defined in the said Act."
2.21 It is therefore now established law that computer software after being
put on to a media and sold has become goods like any other audio cassette or
painting on canvas or a book. The AO was therefore not justified in holding
that the computer software on a media continues to be intellectual property
right. The issue of payment for acquisition of copy of software programme has
been considers by Hon'ble ITAT Bangalore Bench in the case of Lucent
Technologies Hindustan Ltd. Vs. ITO (2005) 92 ITD 366. In this case the
taxpayer had purchased from US company an integrated equipment which consisted
of both hardware and software as one cannot function without help of other.
The acquisition of software was inextricably linked to the acquisition of
hardware and one could not function without the other. The assessee company
which was engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of electronic
switching systems required for the telecommunication industry, did not deduct
tax at source while making payment on the ground that acquisition of software
was inextricably linked to the acquisition of hardware and as the transfer of
software had taken place outside India, no profit accrued or arose or could be
deemed to have accrued or arisen in India. The AO directed for deduction of
tax at source u/s.195. Hon'ble ITAT, after appreciating the provisions of
Article- 12 of the Indo-US DTAA and the provisions of section 9(1)(vi) of the
I.T. Act, has held that the assessee did not acquire any right in the
software. The assessee had only acquired integrated equipment both of hardware
and software from Lucent, USA. The assessee did not acquire any right to
duplicate the software in making use of same. The software supplied by Lucent,
USA is customer-specific and cannot be reused or duplicated in any other
exchange where identical orders were placed by the DOT. It was held that the
payment made for the purchase of software did not partake the character of
royalty and as such there was no obligation to deduct tax at source. The facts
in the case of appellant are quite similar to this decision. The hardware is
being purchased and simultaneously software is also being purchased from LTGL.
The software is for the uses in the hardware purchased simultaneously. As per
the Contract conditions mentioned in section-15 of the agreement appellant did
not acquire any right of duplication of software except for use in its own
system.
2.22 Section 9 of the I.T. Act provides for income deemed to accrue or arise
in India. Section 9(1)(vi) refers to accrual of income by way of royalty.
Explanation-2 to section 9(1)(vi) provides the definition of royalty which
reads as under:
9\. Income deemed to accrue or arise in India.
(1) The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India:
                                          17                 Reliance and Lucent Group
             (vi)    in come by way of royalty payable by-
            (a) the Government; or
(b) a person who is a resident, except where the royalty is payable in respect
of any right, property or information used or services utilised for the
purposes of a business or profession carried on by such person outside India
or for the purposes of making or earning any income from any source outside
India; or
(c) a person who is a non-resident, where the royalty is payable in respect of
any right, property or information used or services utilised for the purposes
of a business or profession carried on by such person in India or for the
purposes of making or earning any income from any source in India:
Explanation 2. -For the purposes of this clause, "royalty" means consideration
(inducing any lump sum consideration but excluding any consideration which
would be the income of the recipient chargeable under the head "Capital
gains") for-
(i) the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in
respect of a patent, invention, model design, secret formula or process or
trade mark or similar property;
(ii) the imparting of any information concerning the working of, or the use
of, a patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process or trade
mark or similar property;
(iii) the use of any patent, Invention, model, design, secret formula or
process or trade mark or similar property;
(iv) the imparting of any Information concerning technical, industrial,
commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or skill,
(v) the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in
respect of any copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work including
films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in
connection with radio broadcasting, but not including consideration for the
sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films; or
(vi) the rendering of any services in connection with the activities referred
to in sub-clauses (i) to (iv),(iva) and (v). 2.23 Clause (v) of Explanation-2
provides that the consideration received on transfer of all or any rights
(including the granting of a license) in respect of any copyright, literary,
artistic or scientific work would be deemed to be royalty. Clause (i) of
Explanation-2 similarly provides that consideration received on the transfer
of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in respect of a
patent, invention, model, secret formula or process or similar property would
amount to royalty. Clause (iii) of Explanation-2 provides that consideration
for the use of any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process
18 Reliance and Lucent Group would amount to royalty.
2.24 On the other hand, the definition of royalty in Article-12(3) of the
Indo-Us DTAA provides as under:
"Article-12(3). The term "royalties" as used in this article means:
(a) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the
right to use, any copyright of a literary, artistic, or scientific work,
including cinematograph films or work on film, tape or other means of
reproduction for use in connection with radio or television broadcasting, any
patent, trademark design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for
information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience,
Including gains derived from the alienation of any such right or property
which are contingent on the productivity, use or disposition thereof; and
(b) payments of any kind received as consideration for the Use of, or the
right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, other than
payments derived by an enterprise described in paragraph 1 of article 8
(Shipping and Air Transport) from activities described in paragraph 2(c) or 3
of article 8."
2.25 It can clearly be seen that the definition of royalty in Article-l2(3) of
the DTAA is more restrictive than what is provided in Section 9(1)(vi). 2.26
LTGL is a tax resident of USA and therefore is entitled to the benefit of DTAA
over the provisions of the Income-tax Act. Consequently if the payment of
software is not covered by the definition of royalty in Article-12 being
covered by section 9(1)(vii) would be irrelevant. Definition of royalty in
Artfcle-l2(3) is in following parts:
a) Consideration for the Use of, or the right to use, any copyright of a
literary, artistic or scientific work.
b) Consideration for the use of or right to use of any Patent, trademark,
design or model, plan, secret formula or process.
c) Consideration for the use of or right to Use cinematograph film or work on
film, tape or other means of reproduction of the use in connection with radio
or television broadcasting.
d) Consideration for the information concerning Industrial, commercial or
scientific experience.
e) Including gains derived from the alienation of any such right or property
which are contingent on the productivity, use or disposition thereof The
computer software can only be covered in item (a) or (b) above. 2.27 Computer
software as copyright.
Article-12(3)(a) provides that the consideration for the use of any copyright
or right to use of any copyright is royalty.
19 Reliance and Lucent Group Definition of copyright is not provided in the
DTAA and therefore definition of copyright provided in the Copyright Act, 1957
is relevant. Section-13 of the Copyright Act provides as under:
"13. Works in which copyright subsists. (1) Subject to the provisions of this
section and the other provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist
throughout India in the following classes of works, that is to say,-
(a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works;
     (b)      cinematograph films; and
     (c)      sound recording.
(2) Copyright shall not subsist in any work specified in sub-section(1), other
than a work to which the provisions of section 40 or section 41 apply, unless,
(i) in the case of a published work, the work is first published in India, or
where the work is first published outside India, the author is at the date of
such publication, or in a case where the author was dead at that date, was at
the time of his death, a citizen of India;
(ii) in the case of an unpublished work other than a work of architecture, the
author is at the date of the making of the work a citizen of India or
domiciled in India; and
(iii) in the case of a work of architecture, the work is located In India.
Explanation. In the case of a work of joint authorship, the conditions
conferring copyright specified in this sub-section shall be satisfied by all
the authors of the work (3) Copyright shall not subsist-
> (a) in any cinematograph film if a substantial part of the film is an
> infringement -of the copyright in any other work;
> (b) in any sound recording made in respect of a literary, drama tic or
> musical work, if in making the sound recording, copyright in such work ahs
> been infringed.
(4) The copyright in a cinematograph film or a sound recording shall not
affect the separate copyright in any work in respect of which or a substantial
part of which, the film, or, as the case may be, the sound recording is made.
(5) In the case of a work of architecture copyright shall subsist only in the
artistic character and design and shall not extend to processes or methods of
construction"
2.28 Section-13 therefore clearly provides that - the copyright shall subsist
only in respect of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works,
cinematograph films and Sound recording. It is therefore clear that the
copyright is different from the work. Copyright about work is not synonymous
with that work. Copy right is an incorporeal property in a work (a corporeal
property).
                                              20                 Reliance and Lucent Group
    2.29    Section-14 of the Copyright Act provides the definition of
    copyright     which reads as under:
"14. Meaning of Copyright. For the purpose of this Act, "copyright" means the
exclusive right subject to the provisions of this Act to do or authorise the
doing of any of the following acts in respect of a work or any substantial
part thereof, namely-
> (a) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a
> computer programme, -
> (i) to reproduce the work in any material form inducing the storing of it in
> any medium by electronic means;
> (ii) to issue copies of the work to the public and not being copies already
> in circulation;
> (iii) to perform the work in public, or communicate it to the public;
> (iv) to make any cinematograph film or sound recording in respect of the
> work;
> (v) to make any translation of the work,
> (vi) to make any adaptation of the work;
> (vii) to do, in relation to a translation or any adaptation of the work, any
> of the acts specified in relation to the work in sub- clauses (i) to (vi);
> (b) in the case of a computer programme-
> (i) to do any of the acts specified in clause (a);
> (ii) to sell or give on commercial rental or offer for sale or for
> commercial rental any copy of the computer programme; Provided that such
> commercial rental does not apply in respect of computer programmes where the
> programme itself is not the essential object of the rental."
2.30 The definition of copyright in section-14 is exhaustive definition since
the words used are 'copyright means'. Copyright is a bundle of rights
mentioned in section-14 above. This right consists of right to reproduce the
work, issues of copies of the work in public, performance of the work in
public, making translation, adaptation, etc. In respect of computer programme
relevant for the issue under consideration, copyright mainly consists of
following rights:
    (a)     to produce the work in any material form.
    (b)     to issue copies of the work to the public.
    (c)     to sell or give on commercial rental or offer for sale or for commercial
            rental any copy of computer programme.
2.31 Examination of the agreement of the appellant with LTGL reveals that
section-15 of the agreement quoted earlier forbids the appellant from
transferring, assigning, sublicensing or using 21 Reliance and Lucent Group by
outsourcing the software. The agreement also forbids the appellant from
decompiling, reverse engineering, disassembling or decoding the software.
Section-15 also contemplates that all copies of the software provided to the
appellant are the copyright of LTGL. These copies shall be held secret and
software shall not be disclosed to anybody else. Agreement provides that all
copies of software shall be returned to LTGL upon termination or cancellation
or the agreement. Agreement also provides that the appellant shall use the
software only for the operation of wireless Reliance network and shall not
sublicense or modify the software. The perusal of section-15 of the agreement
clearly reveals that the appellant has got a copy of software for being used
in its telecom network. The appellant has got no right as envisaged in
section-14 of the Copyright Act to duplicate the software, to Issue copies of
software in public or to give copies of software in rent or even to reverse
engineer, decompile or modify the software. The sum total of the conditions
mentioned in the section-is is that LTGL has given no part of Copyright as
envisaged in section-14 of the copyright to the appellant. Thus, sale of
software by LTGL to the appellant cannot be said to be the transfer of the
copyright to LTGL either in part or in whole. Thus, consideration paid by the
appellant to LTGL for acquiring copy of software is not for the use of
copyright or transfer of right to use of copyright. As mentioned above,
copyright is different from the work In respect of which copyright subsist.
The appellant has only got a copy of software without any part of the
copyright of the software. Thus, payment made by the appellant for acquiring
copy of software does not amount to royalty within the definition of
Article-12(3) of the DTAA. 2.32 Similar issue that whether the supply of a
copy of software programme without transfer of any part of copyright amounts
to royalty or not has been considered by various benches of ITAT recently.
Hon'ble ITAT, Bangalore Bench in the case of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. Vs.
ITO 93 TTJ 658, 276 ITR (AT) 1 has had a occasion to consider the similar
case. It was held in the case that the definition of royalty u/s.9(1)(vi) is
wider than the definition of royalty in various DTAA. Since the provisions in
the DTAA have to be followed, if they are more beneficial to the taxpayer then
the definition of royalty in DTAA has to be considered. Hon'ble ITAT had
observed that as per the agreement between the parties is case the taxpayer
had acquired only a copy of the software or the copyright article whereas the
copyright remained with the owner i.e. foreign party. It was held that upon
the sale of copyright article incorporeal right to software i.e. copyright was
not transferred to the assessee. It was held that right to use of a copyright
is totally different from right to use the programme embedded in a cassette or
CD or it may be a software. It was held that the sale of copy of copyright
article called software did not amount to royalty within the definition of
Article-12(3) of the Indo-US DTAA. Reliance was placed on the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Tata Consultancy Services 271 ITR 401.
                                       22                Reliance and Lucent Group
    2.33    Hon'ble Special Bench ITAT Delhi had again an occasion to
consider the similar issue in the case of Motorola Inc. (2005) 270 ITR (AT)
62, TTJ 01. In this case the Hon'ble ITAT had discussed the provisions of the
Copyright Act. They examined the conditions in the non- exclusive restricted
license of the software and found-that the supplier of software had only
transferred a copy of the software or copyrighted article but had not
transferred any of the copyright. Under these circumstances, consideration
received for the sale of Copyright article, namely, software was held not to
be royalty, it was also held that copyright is different from the copyright
article. In this case the issue of software provided to the cellular operator
for setting up the cellular telephone network was covered. It was held that
the software which is provided by the supplier for the use in the cellular
network does not involve transfer of any part of copyright of the software but
only amounts to sale of a copyrighted article, namely, the copy of computer
programme. Copyright continue to remain with the supplier of the computer
programme.
2.34 The Hon'ble Delhi Bench of ITAT in the case of Lotus Asia Specific ITA
No.564 to 566/Del/05 order dated 28.04.2006 have also examined the same issue
and have held that in the cask of a sale of shrink-wrap software being a
copyright~ article, consideration received does not amount to royalty as there
-is no transfer of any part of copyright in the, computed programme which
continues to remain with the software supplier.
2.35 The Hon'ble ITAT Bangalore Bench in the case of Sonata Information
Technologies Ltd. ITA No.1561 to 1580/Bang/2004 dated 31.01.2006 have
considered the issue of payment received on sale of computer software without
transfer of any copyright. Hon'ble ITAT had examined the issue of royalty
within the meaning of section 9(1)(vi) and as provided in the DTAA. Hon'ble
ITAT had examined in detail the issue of royalty in respect of sale of shrink-
wrap software. They also examined the copyright in respect of computer
programme being the right to sell or given a commercial rental any copy of
software programmes. The ITAT examined the genesis of additional copyright
given in respect of computer programme in section 14(b)(ii) of the Copyright
Act. The Hon'ble ITAT referred to Berne convention, Rome convention, WIPO
copyright treaty, TRIPS. It was held that the copyright in the software is
different from any right in the physical manifestation of the software
contained in a CD floppy or on a hard Disc in which the software is
downloaded. It was held that when a distributor of Microsoft acquires the
copies of software, he does not acquires the distributor right which is a
copyright within the meaning of section-14(a)(ii) or the right to sell or to
give on commercial rental, a right under section 14(b)(ii). The distributor
merely obtained the right to distribute the copyrighted material which is a
property different from the property in the copyright in the software. The
property contained in copyrighted material and the property contained in the
copyright to software are two different rights and when a person acts as a
distributor 23 Reliance and Lucent Group for the copyrighted material he has
not acquired the distribution rights within the meaning of section-14(a)(ii)
r.w.s. 14(b)(ii). 2.36 Hon'ble ITAT also made a reference to the OECD- Model
Commentary in para-12 to 17 dealing with the payment of software. Reference to
the UN Commentary 2001 on the UN Model Convention relating to Article 12 was
also made. Hon'ble ITAT held that the Model Commentaries give the
authoritative interpretation of the provisions of the DTAA and these are legal
aid in interpretation of provisions of DTAA entered into by two sovereign
countries. Hon'ble ITAT accordingly held that the payment received for the
sale of copyrighted article, namely, a copy of computer programme without
transfer of any of the copyright does not amount to royalty as per the DTAA.
2.37 The Hon'ble ITAT, Bangalore Bench in the case of Hewlett Packard India
(P) Ltd. (2006) 5 SOT 660 (Bang) has also considered a similar case. In this
case Indian company was engaged in the business of providing network solution
to its customers. This activity includes sale of software packages to
customers. For this purpose the Indian company had imported readymade software
Packages from Hewlett Packard USA. The Indian company sold these software
Packages to its customers in the packed conditions Hon'ble ITAT held that the
consideration received by the foreign company for the sale of software
Packages to the Indian company did not amount to royalty within the meaning of
Artlcle-12(3) of the Indo-US DTAA. It was held that the sale of copyrighted
article is different from the transfer of the copyright in the computer
software. 2.38 It is therefore very apparent from several decisions of Hon'ble
ITAT that in the case of sale of copyrighted article, namely, a copy of
computer programme, payment received is not royalty if there is no transfer of
copyright partly or wholly. Facts obtaining in the case of appellant clearly
point that no part of the copyright as envisaged by section-14 of the
Copyright Act has been transferred to the appellant by LTGL. Therefore the
payment for purchase of software cannot amount to royalty within the meaning
of Article-12(3) 2.39 The AO has also held the software can be treated as
patent and invention and has failed to provide how it can be treated as patent
and invention. Under the Copyright Act, computer programme has been treated as
literary, artistic work worthy of copyright. Patent has been defined in the
Patents Act, 1970 in Section-2(1)(m) meaning a patent for any invention
granted under this Act. Invention has been defined in section-2(1)(j) of the
Patents Act meaning a new product or process involving an inventive step and
capable of industrial application. Section- 3 of the Patents Act Provides
"what are not Inventions", which reads as under:
"3. What are not inventions - The following are not inventions within the
meaning of this Act, -
> k) a mathematical or business method or a computer programe per se or
> algorithms;"
                                      24                 Reliance and Lucent Group
    2.40    It is therefore very apparent that computer software cannot be
> patented. Thus computer software cannot be treated as patent as it is not
> covered by the Patents Act. Further invention has been defined in the
> Patents Act to mean a new product or process involving an inventive step and
> capable of industrial application. It is therefore apparent that the
> invention under the Patents Act means ether the product or a new process of
> the product. It does not include a computer software, Therefore, the
> software cannot be treated as a patent or invention.
Arguments of the AO are therefore not accepted.
2.41 The AO has also referred to a Circular dated 29.12.2000 of the Govt. of
Singapore exempting shrink-wrap software from withholding tax. The AO has held
that because Singapore has granted specific exemption regarding payment for
the acquisition of shrink-wrap software. Under the Income-tax Act, no such
exemption has been provided and therefore payment received for supply of
software is royalty. This issue was also be considered by ITAT Bangalore in
the case of Sonata Information Technologies Ltd. (cited supra) wherein it has
been held that one has to look at the position of law under the Income-tax
Act, 1961 and not be guided by provisions of foreign statute unless it is
shown what the statute deals with, its provisions and context of observation.
No assistance can be drawn from a circular of Govt. of Singapore. Thus in the
absence of the study of the Singapore Income-tax Law and Singapore Copyright
Law, no Reliance can be placed on the Circular of Govt. of Singapore.
2.42 Hon'ble ITAT in the case of Sonata Information Technologies Ltd. has also
considered the observations of USA in respect of acquisition of a copyrighted
article as well as the observations of Australia regarding the acquisition of
software. Hon'ble ITAT had held that under both US and Australia views,
payments for acquisition of software being a copyrighted article do not amount
to royalty but are payments only in respect of a copyrighted article. The
appellant has produced the copy of Australian Taxation Office ruling TR93/12
from which it is seen that the payment received for a sale of copy of
programme is only price of the sale of goods and does not amount to royalty.
US observation on the copyrighted article as mentioned by the AO has also been
perused by me. There is apparently no contradiction between the findings of
the several benches of the ITAT and the US & Australia Tax Rulings.
2.43 The AO has also relied upon the decision of Hon'ble AAR in the ruling In
P.No.30 of 1999, 238 1TR 296. I have examined this ruling. In this case no
software was supplied. On the contrary a central processing facility was
created which was being used by other party and for such uses payment was
being made. It was held that the payment made for such uses amounted to
royalty since process being used included secret formula, design, model and
also proprietary software. The facts in the case of appellant are entirely
different. The appellant has purchased copy of software programme. Ratio of
ruling of ARR is therefore not applicable.
                                             25                 Reliance and Lucent Group
          2.44    The AR has referred to the decision of Hon'ble Calcutta High
Court in the case of Leonhardt Andhra Und Partner, Gmbri vs. Commissioner of
Income-tax (2001) 249 ITR 418. The AR has explained that this decision is not
applicable since at the relevant time there was no DTAA between India and
Germany and the definition of 'royalties' given in sec.9(1)(vi), Explanation
(2) was applied.
I have perused the order of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court. In this case, the
decision was rendered on the basis of definition of 'royalty' under the
provision to explanation (2) to sect. 9(1)(vi) in the absence of DTAA between
India and Germany. The definition of 'royalty' under explanation (2) is much
wider then the definition given in Article 12 of the DTAA, e.g. the payment
received for giving license in respect of copy right or a patent design,
secret formal amounts to 'royalty' under item (i) Explanation (2) to sec.
9(1)(vi)., whereas the definition of royalty under Article 12(3) under the
DTAA only talks about consideration received for the use of, or the right to
use, any copyright, any patent, trademark, design or model, plant, secret
formula or process etc. Thus definition of royalty is restrictive in DTAA and
the provisions of the DTAA having overriding effect over the provision of the
Income-tax Act, the definition of 'royalty' in the DTAA only would apply. In
view of this the decision in the case of Leonhardt Andhra Und Partner, GmbH
vs. CIT (cited supra) is not applicable. The AO has wrongly relied upon this
decision. 2.45 With above discussion, it is held that the appellant under the
Software Contract acquired only a copy of software programme and did not
acquire any copyright over such software as envisaged by section-14 of the
Copyright Act. Under these circumstances, payment made by the appellant to
LTGL cannot be said to be payment for the use of or right to use of copyright.
Thus, payment amounted only for purchase of copyrighted article and does not
amount to royalty within the meaning of Artilce-12(3) of the DTAA. It is
accordingly held that the AO was not justified in directing to deduct the tax
at source u/s.195. No income accrues to LTGL in India against the payment of
US 1106,56,855/- for the supply of software for use in the Reliance Telecom
Network. Appeal on ground No. 1 to 7 is allowed.
11\. Thus the learned CIT(A) accepted Reliance contentions that what it
obtained was only a copyrighted article which does not have any copyrity and
section 14 of Copyright Act does not apply as Reliance does not have any right
to duplicate software, to issue copies of software. Ld CIT(A) relied on the
Coordinate Bench decision in the case of Samsung Electronics 276 ITR (AT) 1,
Lucent Technologies Hindustan Ltd. 92 ITD 366, Motorola Special Bench Decision
reported in 270 ITR (AT) 62 and other Bangalore Bench decisions on the issue.
Revenue is aggrieved.
26 Reliance and Lucent Group
12\. Learned Special Counsel's arguments centred around the fact that what the
assessee has obtained is only a license, which involved a copyright under the
Copyright Act and the definition of Royalty under the Income Tax Act is also
applicable. The detailed submissions canbe summarised as under: -
> a) Rights in software are in the nature of copyright,
> b) Licensing of software amounts to Royalty under the income tax even before
> amendment of 2012.
> c) Even under Article 12 of DTAA use of copyright of a literary article,
> scientific work, secret formula, process and also for use of industrial,
> commercial or scientific equipment is Royalty read with Copyright Act of
> India.
Learned counsel, relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
the case of Autodisk Inc. and Microsoft Computer (placed in the paper book at
page 1698 to 1704) submitted that there is copyright involved as the
infringement is punishable. He elaborated on OECD commentary, stand of India
on OECD commentary. He mainly relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court order in the case of CIT vs. Synopsis International Old Ltd. 212
Taxman 454 (Kar) and Samsung Electronics Ltd. 345 ITR 494 (Kar), CIT vs.
Lucent Technologies 348 ITR 196 (Kar) and AAR decision in the case of Citrix
Systems Asia Pacific PVt. Ltd. 343 ITR 1 (AAR). He also relied on the
Coordinate Bench decision in the case of Microsoft/Gracemac Corporation 42 SOT
550 (Del) and other decisions for support. The learned counsel also submitted
that Lucent has PE in India, so the profits are taxable in India.
13\. The learned counsel of Reliance, Shri J.D. Mistry, referring to the main
contracts relevant for the issue i.e., software contract, GTC and Assignment
contracts submitted the main purpose of entering various contracts are for
setting up mobile network and placed order for hardware and software and
software does not work without the hardware network. The software is nothing
but computer technology. As a sequeter by 27 Reliance and Lucent Group
computer programming, the equipment works which result in network
communications. This software is specific to the machinery on which it works
and is different from Shrink wrapped software which is sold off the self. Then
referring to the 'copyright' argument, the learned counsel simplified the
logic by referring to Income Tax commentary of Kanga & Palkiwala to submit the
publisher may have copyrights of authors but the ultimate user by purchasing
the book gets only a copyrighted article and no copyrights. It was the
submission that Reliance has no interest in intellectual rights of seller and
only interest Reliance has is as to how the network functions and helps in
communication system. Since the software is in binary system, the word license
is used but this is different from License of copyright contemplated in the
Act. Reliance is not exploiting any license/copyright while using the software
purchased.
14\. Continuing the arguments, learned counsel referred to the master
agreement where the contract is for supply of hardware, software and services
for establishing the network. It was the submission that the software supply
contract was assigned to M/s. Lucent LLC USA and the same was to ensure that
the software helps in equipment usage, as the equipment can work only with the
software. He referred to the purchase order placed, as is referred by the
learned CIT(A) that each purchase of equipment matches with placing order for
relevant software and the software is the medium/mechanism for using the
hardware. Referring to clause 15 of the agreement, the arguments were that the
license was given for use of non-tangible goods unlike hardware refer to
various terms specified therein to submit that license is only for exclusive
use by Reliance and no intellectual property right were transferred nor any
copyrights were given.
15\. The learned counsel referred to OECD commentary on Royalty, Software
License agreements and provisions of the Act, DTAA and Copyright Act. He also
distinguished the case law relied on by the learned counsel of Revenue. The
learned counsel distinguished the decisions of Autodesk and Microsoft relied
on by the Revenue submitting that they are given in the context of violation
of copyright which are not involved in this transaction 28 Reliance and Lucent
Group and does not apply. With reference to the Revenue's contentions about
the amended provisions of IT Act, it was submitted that the DTAA (Article 12)
has not been amended and so it has no application. He referred to the decision
of B4U Int.holdings ltd in ITA/3326/Mum/2006 dt. 28/05/12 (Para 13-17) in
support. Likewise decisions of WNS North America Inc in ITA 8621/M/2010 dated
14.12.2012 (para 3.6 to 3.10). It was also submitted that the decisions of
Karnataka High Court in the case of Synopsis International (page 1711 in Paper
Book) is about designing mechanism and considered in the context of definition
under section 9(1)(vi) of the IT Act whereas DTAA overrides the said
provisions. Moreover, it was submitted that the issues involved is with
reference to right 'in respect of 'copyright used in DTAA.
16\. It was clarified that service agreement was assigned to Lucent Alcatel
and referred to the findings of learned CIT(A) (para 2.14) to submit that the
Reliance is purchasing as and when modules were added (add-on-modules). The
learned counsel also distinguished the decision of the Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court in the case of Samsung Electronics. It was submitted that the Reliance
has not purchased Shrink Wrapped product, there is no right to copy. So no
copyrights and provisions of Copyright Act was wrongly applied. Regarding the
argument of Revenue that OECD commentary was not accepted/followed by India,
the learned counsel for the Reliance referred to the decisions of: -
(1) Visakhapatnam Prot Trust 146 ITR 146 (AP) (2) Graphite India 86 ITD 384
(3) James Mackintosh & Co P Ltd 93 ITD 466 (Pune) (4) Metchem Canada Inc 5 SOT
121 (Mum) It was the submission that OECD commentary was relied on even by the
Special Bench in the case Motorola (supra) in order to interpret the DTAA. The
learned counsel then relied on the following cases in support of the
contentions:
1) DIT vs Ericson AB 204 Taxmann 192.
2) Solid Works corporation 51 SOT 34.
29 Reliance and Lucent Group
3) Allianz SE in ITA/1569/PN/08 dt. 14/03/12.
4) Sonata information Tech Ltd. in ITA4446/Mum/2011 dt.03/04/12.
5) Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 271 ITR 401(SC).
6) BSNL Vs Union of India 2006(2) S. T. R 161(SC)
17\. The learned counsel also submitted detailed note on 'Royalties' under
various treaties as the Reliance also purchased from various other Country-
Resident companies. Arguments were also placed on 'goods', 'equipment' used in
definitions. Lastly, it was also contended that the issue of existence of PE
in the case of Lucent cannot be considered as AO has not raised the issue in
his order. It was his submission that additional grounds cannot fasten
liability.
18\. In reply, the learned counsel for Revenue relied on the decision of NTPC
to submit that Revenue can raise new ground/argument which is legal. It was
his argument that the agreement was assigned to LTGL and not executed by
Lucent india. He reiterated the contention that License is for use of
copyright and not for copyrighted articles. He referred to the ownership and
redesigning of software at the end of 10 year period to submit that software
is not sold, only license to use was granted. Referring to the terms of
agreement, it was submitted that when software was supplied through a medium
of CD, Reliance has only license to use the same and in the case of software,
it can only be treated as use of copyright. As an alternative submission, it
was also contended that the use of software can also be considered as 'use of
equipment' when it is loaded on CD becomes a tangible item and works through
the computers. Since the software is to be referred as provided in clause
15.1.5, it is not taken as use of copyright, it can also be taken as use of
equipment under DTAA. The learned counsel for Revenue submitted that in the
case of product patent there can be sale but, a process patent can only
licensed.
ITA Nos. 7001/M/10 to 7004/ M/10 - Lucent Technologies GRL LLC
19\. The facts in this case are, Lucent is a company incorporated in and a tax
resident of USA. It supplied software to Reliance lnfocomm Ltd. (Now known as
Reliance Communications Ltd.) for its wireless Reliance network.
30 Reliance and Lucent Group The assessment order u/s.143(3) dated 30.12.2008
was passed for A.Y. 2006-07 where total receipts of the Lucent amounting to
Rs.162.77 crores was brought to tax as 'Royalty' even though the Lucent had
claimed the same was non-taxable. It was noticed that an agreement under which
software was supplied was operative w.e.f. 5.8.2002 and the Lucent was in
receipt of similar payment for other years also. In view of this, after
recording reasons, the A.O. initiated proceedings u/s.147 for all years
covered in the order. On going through the relevant clauses of the Agreement,
AO held that what the Reliance is getting is the license to use the software,
no other title or interest in the software is transferred to the payer, hence
there is no question of sale of software per se. If, at all there is an
element of sale, it is only in respect of the carrier media i.e. the floppy or
CD in which the software is transacted. However, in view of the enormous
difference in the values of the carrier media and the software, the 'sale' of
carrier media is ignored being very small. AO did not agree that it was sale
for the following reasons: -
> 1\. License remains a license, irrespective of the period involved and
> 2\. In this fast paced technological progress, the rate of obsolescence in
> software is very high.
Hence, license in perpetuity has no significance since the economic life of
software itself is limited. The title and proprietary rights would remain with
Lucent. AO gave a finding that it is quite clear from the section 15 of the
Wireless Network General terms and conditions Contract that the software is
the property of Lucent. It has also provided in the Agreement that the
applicant would not be the owner Software but would remain the licensee for
the use of or the right to the copy right. It is no way to reconstitute as a
sale of software.
20\. Lucent argued before AO that Reliance has been granted in perpetuity
irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, unlimited royalty free license to
use the software for its benefit in connection with the ownership, operation
and maintenance of its Wireless Reliance Network. The intellectual property
rights in the software vests with the Lucent and Reliance is not permitted to
transfer, assign, sub-license such software or modify, 31 Reliance and Lucent
Group decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble or in any other manner
decode the software furnished, as object code. Reliance is also not permitted
to make copies of the software except for back up purposes. The consideration
received for supply of software is not in the nature of royalty since Reliance
has not been granted any rights in the underlying copyrights of the software.
Therefore, Reliance merely purchases a copy of the copyrighted article namely,
a computer program, called 'software', which is a standard commercial software
and can be supplied to any other telephony network player. The Lucent further
argued that the payment is not covered by Copyright Act also and so cannot be
considered in the nature of royalty.
21\. AO discussed the issue about the receipts assessable as Royalty. His
detailed order on the issue is as under:
> "To appreciate the nature of the transaction it is necessary to appreciate
> the special nature of software, the nature of transfers of software, sale of
> software, the concepts of royalty, etc which are dealt with in detail below:
> 4.1. What is software?
> The phrase "computer software" is commonly used to describe computer
> programs and ancillary materials associated with the development and
> operation of a computer program, but which does not include computer
> hardware. Explanation 3 to section 9(1)(vi) specifically defines a software
> as under -
> 'Explanation 3.---For the purposes of this clause, "computer software" means
> any computer Program recorded on any disc, tape, perforated media or other
> information storage device and includes any such Program or any customized
> electronic data;
> Clause (b) of explanation to Section 8OHHE also defines software as -
> (b) "computer software" means,--
(i) any computer program recorded on any disc, tape, (~ I perforated media or
other information storage device, or
(ii) any customised electronic data or any product or service of similar
nature as may be notified by the Board, which is transmitted or exported from
India to a place outside India by any means A computer program is a series of
instructions written in a language which computer can understand and execute.
When a program is run, three processes are involved namely input, processing
and output. A program is normally written in a computer language say cobol,
c+, fortran, basic etc. This is known as "source code". When this program is
32 Reliance and Lucent Group converted into an executable form so that
computer can understand the same, it is called "object code". A user of
program normally gets the object code and not the source code. The source code
remains secret property of the developer.
4.2. Transfers in respect of software.
In the present case, we are concerned with granting of license to use a
software developed by the assessee to Reliance Communications Ltd (earlier
known as Reliance hnfocomm). Reliance has been granted a non- transferable
right. The seller has indemnified the buyer/Licensee against any breach of any
intellectual property or Patent regulations in using, maintaining or
transferring of the software tools. 4.3. Whether sale of software is sale of
Goods?
4.3.1 The title and proprietary notices of the software would remain with
assessee. who is the owner of the programme. The Software Distribution/
Reseller Agreement makes it very clear that the software is the property of
the assessee. It is also provided in the Agreement that the user would not be
the owner of the Software but would remain the licensee for the use of or the
right to use of the copyright. It is in no way to constitute as a sale of
software.
4.3.2 The assessee has relied upon the decision of Constitutional Bench of
Supreme Court in the case of Tata Consultancy Services vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh (20041141 Taxman 132 (SC). In this case, Supreme Court was concerned
with canned software (i.e. computer software packages off the shelf). It was
concerned with sale of canned software and whether such canned software can be
termed as 'goods' and as such can it be assessable to sales tax. Supreme Court
held that sale o software is clearly a sale of 'goods' within the meaning of
Sec.2(h) of Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 and Article 366 of the
Constitution of India. It was also held that no distinction can be made
between branded and unbranded software. Supreme Court made certain interesting
observations which are summarized below :- - "The term 'goods' as used in
Article 366(12) of the Constitution and as defined under the Act is very wide
and includes all types of movable properties, whether those properties be
tangible or intangible. A software programme may consist of various commands
which enable the computer to perform a designated task. The copyright in that
programme may remain with the originator of the programme, but the moment
copies are made and marketed, they become 'goods', which are susceptible to
sales tax. Even intellectual property, once it is put on to a media, whether
it be in the form of books'&~ canvas (in case of painting) or computer discs
or cassettes, and marketed would become 'goods'.
(Para 17)
\- The Copyright Act, 1957 and the Saleb Tax Act are also not statutes in pani
materia and as such the definition contained in the former should not be
applied in the latter.
           (Para 30)
                                       33                Reliance and Lucent Group
\- In the instant case, the Supreme Court was not concerned with the technical
meaning of computer and computen programme as in a fiscal statute plain
meaning rule is applied. (Para 50)
\- In interpreting an expression used in a legal sense, the Courts are
required to ascertain the precise connotation which it possesses in law. It is
furthermore trite that a Court should not be overzealous in searching
ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain. (Para 51)
\- It is well-settled that when an expression is capable of more than one
meanings, the Court would attempt to resolve that ambiguity in a manner
consistent with the purpose of the provisions and with regard to the
consequences of the alternative constructions". (Para 52) 4.3.3 Let us now
consider the applicability of Tata Consultancy Services Co.'s case (supra) for
the transaction under consideration. It is pertinent to consider the
contention usually raised that as 'Software' is - a tariff item both under the
Customs and Excise Laws and Sales Tax Acts, the provisions of Sec.195 are not
applicable, as Sec.195 is not applicable to payments made for import of goods.
In this regard, it is to note that 'Package Softwanes' are neither goods nor
services; they are a separate 'genre by itself. i.e. intellectual property.
The mere fact that customs law or sales tax law deems it to be goods for the
purpose of their Act, does not change the inherent character of the
'software'. In fact, World Trade Organisation (WTO) which has been ratified by
more than 140 countries, has 3 main agreements:
1\. Agreement on trade of goods (GATT)
2\. Agreement on trade of services (GATS)
3\. Agreement on trade of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) This goes on to
indicate that lPRs (Software is an IPR) are a distinct and different class
than those of goods and I or services. In fact, the software may also be
considered as a "process', but this aspect is discussed later. 4.3.4 Thus, as
per the Income Tax Act it is clear that the payment made for the purchase of
software by the user can be considered as payment for use of intellectual
property and not for the purchase of goods. The only exception provided is by
the second proviso to sec. 9(1) (vi), which excludes the computer software
supplied by a non-resident manufacturers along with a computer or computer
based equipment under any scheme approved under the policy on Computer
Software Export, Software Development and Training, 1986 of the Government of
India.
4.3.5 The decision of the Tata Consultancy Services (supra) relied upon by the
assessee is distinguishable with the facts of the present case. The Hon'ble
Authority for Advance Rulings (Income Tax New Delhi) in the case of Airports
Authority of India, in their judgement in A.A.R. Nos.755- 756 of 2007 dated
28.07.2008 discussed the issue in length and it was of opinion that decision
is not applicable in such type of cases. The relevant portion is reproduced
hereinunder:
34 Reliance and Lucent Group "We may now turn to the contention of the
applicant that software is goods and that the present case involves sale of
copyrighted article. As we have mentioned above, the applicant has derived
support from Tata Consultancy Services Co's case (supra) for the first
proposition and Article 12 of the OECD Model Tax Convention for the second
proposition. Tate Consultant Services Co. ~s case (supra) is a decision
rendered by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in a sales tax matter
The appellant therein provided consultancy services, including computer
consultancy services. As per their business, they prepared and loaded on
customer's computers custom made software (uncanned software) and also off the
shelf sold standard software (canned software). The canned software were
copyrighted products of Oracles, Lotus, Master Key. etc. The commercial tax
officer of Andhra Pradesh assessed sales of canned software to sales tax. The
question that arose for the consideration of the Supreme Court was whether the
canned software sold by the appellant could be termed as 'goods' and assessed
to tax under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957. The Court held
that the expression 'goods' as defined in Article 366(12) of the Constitution
of India and as also defined under section 2(h) of the Andhra Pradesh General
Sales Tax Act, 1957 was very wide and included all types of movable property
-- whether tangible or intangible goods' for the purpose of sales tax could
not thus be given narrow meaning. The real test whether an article was 'goods'
or not was whether it was capable of abstraction, consumption and use and
whether it could be transmitted, transferred, delivered, stored or possessed.
A software programme might consist of various commands which enable the
computers to perform a designated task But the moment it was put on a disc and
copies ware made and marketed. it became chattel exigible to sales tax.
Intellectual property, once it was put on to media, whether in the form of
books, canvas, computer disc or cassettes and marketed, would become goods.
The Supreme Court referred to its earlier decision in Associated Cement
Companies Ltd V Commission of Customs 2001 AIR (SC) 862 which it felt directly
dealt with the question in issue. The question in Associated Cement Companies
Ltd.'s case (supra) was whether customs duty was leviable on technical
material supplied in the form of drawings, manuals and computer disc, etc. The
Court observed that the Customs Act defined 'goods' to include all kinds of
movable property It held that what was being taxed under the Customs Act read
with Customs Tariff Act and the Customs Valuation Rules was not the
intellectual input alone but goods whose value had been enhanced by the said
input. The final product at the time of import was either the magazine or the
encyclopaedia or the engineering drawings or disc, as the case may be, and the
charge of duty was on the final product. There was no scope for splitting the
engineering drawing or the encyclopaedia into intellectual input on the one
hand and the paper on which it is scribed on the other.
35 Reliance and Lucent Group It may be mentioned that the legislative scheme
of sales tax law and income tax law are very different. While the object of
sales tax law is to tax transactions of sale of movable properties, Income Tax
law is concerned with taxing incomes and profits of individuals, companies and
other entities in whatever manner' earned. For this purpose, income has been
classified into different types, like business income, income from house
property, salary income, capital gains, royalty income, etc., which have been
given tax treatments. Under The sales tax law, the definitions of the terms
'goods' and 'sale' have been kept very wide. 'Goods' includes all kinds of
movable properties, including intangible things like electricity. Delivery of
goods on hire purchase and the transfer of right to use goods are deemed under
this of law as amounting to sale. There is no provision with regard to royalty
under the Sales Tax law. As could be seen from Tata Consultancy Services' case
(supra). the Court has treated the disc / floppy containing the software as
goods, whose value has been greatly enhanced because of the intellectual
property as such has not been regarded as a taxable event. On the other hand,
under the Income Tax Act as well as DTAA the payment made in lieu of transfer
of right to use copyright is a royalty income. The transfer of disc / floppy
on which the copyrighted software has been inscribed is immaterial for this
purpose.
It is well settled that legal propositions are only authoritative in so far as
they are relevant to the facts in issue in a case. The ratio decidendi of a
court decision, which has binding authority, must thus be read in the light of
the facts of the case and the issue considered. The Supreme Court has pointed
out the following in CIT Vs. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd. (1992) 198 ITR 297
(SC):
"..... it is neither desirable nor permissible to pick out a word or a
sentence from the judgement of this court, divorced from the context of
question under consideration and treat it to be the complete 'law' declared by
this court. The judgement must be mad as a whole and the observations from the
judgement have to be considered in the light of the questions which were
before this court. A decision of this court takes its colour from the
questions involved in the case in which it is rendered and, while applying the
decision to a later case, the courts must carefully try to ascertain the true
principle laid down by the decision of this court and to pick out words or
sentences from the judgement, divorced from the context of the questions under
consideration by this court, to support their reasonings..." As we have
pointed out above, in Tata Consultancy Services' case (supra) the issue under
consideration was whether sale of disc / floppy containing software programme
amounted to sale of goods under the sales tax law of Andhra Pradesh. In fact,
the issue of transfer of right to use the goods (as per expanded definition of
sale) did not come up for consideration in that case. On the other hand, the
issue under consideration in the present case is different. The question here
is whether the consideration is paid for the use or right 36 Reliance and
Lucent Group to use copy right in which case it will be royalty income. As is
clear from the contract provisions, there is no outright transfer of copyright
or sale of disc/ floppy containing software programme in the present case. The
factual background and the legislative provisions with reference to which Tata
Consultancy Services' case (supra) was decided, are quite different from those
of the present case. Thus the applicant can seek no support from the said
decision in order to assail the correctness of the view taken by the Authority
in the earlier case of the applicant"
4.3.6 The software is also covered within the scope of explanation (2)(via) to
sec. 9(1)(vi) which deals with the use or tight to use any industrial,
commercial or scientific equipment. Hon'ble ITAT, Hyderabad also held in case
of M/s Frontline soft Limited ITA no 1080- 1081/Hyderabad/03 held vide para 25
as below:
25 The Apex Court in the case of Tata Consultancy Services v. State of A.P.
271 ITR 401 (SC) = (2004-TIOL-87-SC-CT-LB) held that notwithstanding the fact
that computer software is intellectual property, whether it is conveyed in
diskettes, magnetic tapes of C. D. Roms. whether canned or uncanned. whether
it conies as part of the computer or independently, whether it is branded or
unbranded, tangible or intangible, it is a commodity capable of being
transmitted, transformed, delivered, stored, processed etc. therefore it is
'goods' liable to sales-tax. The above judgement is in respect of A.P. sales
tax Act. By the expedient of "deemed fiction" or "inclusive definition"
Parliament and state Legislatures are competent to give a specific statute
only. Such definition cannot be imported in different statutes which define
the same transactions differently. Royalty has specifically defined in Income-
tax provisions, 9(1) (vi) Explanation 2 (iva). Therefore, same is only
required to be considered for the purposes of income- tax. The decision in the
case of Sonata Software Ltd. vs. ITO (6 SOT 700) (Ban galore) =
(2006-TIOL-270-lTAT-BANG) is distinguishable on facts as in that case clause
(iva) to Explanation 2 to section 9(1) (vi) inserted by the Finance Act 2001
w. e. f. 2002-03 has not been considered."
4.3.7 In view of the above the Reliance on the case of Tata Consultancy
Limited by the assessee is misplaced. It may also be mentioned here that
various other decisions which have been relied upon by the assessee also
considered and relied upon the decision in case of Tata Consultancy Limited,
and so all these decisions will not help the assessee. 4.4. Concept of Royalty
4.4.1 The term 'royalty' normally connotes the payment made to a person who
has exclusive right over a thing for allowing another to make use of that
thing which may be either physical or intellectual property or a thing. The
exclusivity of the right in relation to the thing for which royalty is paid
should be with the grantor of that right. Intellectual property law is that
area of law, which is concerned with the protection 37 Reliance and Lucent
Group of ideas, the expression of ideas, invention and commercial goodwill. It
includes copyright law, the law of patents, breach of confidence, design law,
trademark law and the law of passing-off.
4.4.2 The Karnataka High Court in the case of Citizen Watch Co. Ltd. [148 ITR
774 (Kar.) and the Calcutta High Court in the case of Davy Ashmore India Ltd.
(190 ITR 626 (Cal) have also clearly held that the royalty is a payment for
grant of right to use any property, the ownership of which continues to vest
with the grantor. This means that only in cases where ownership of the asset
in question is retained and the right to use is granted, the payment of the
same will constitute royalty. 4.4.3 For the purposes of interpretation of the
DTAA, one has to go by the general meaning of the term 'royalty' in view of
the decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Siemens
Aktiengesellschaft v. ITO (1987) 22 lTD 87 (Born.) and not by the definition
as contained in Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi). The general meaning of
royalty, after considering the Calcutta High Court decision in CIT v. Stanton
& Stavely (Overseas) Ltd. t19841 146 ITR 405, its definition meaning given in
Encyclopedia Britannica (1972 Edition) and Gujarat High Court decision in CIT
v. Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico Printing Co. (19831 139 ITR 806 and others, the
Hon'ble ITAT observed as under:
"It is thus clear that the general concept of the term 'royalty' does not rule
out 'lump sum payments' being considered as 'royalty' as well as payments made
for know-how. The mere fact that a particular knowledge, which is imparted may
not be statutorily protected as in the case of a patent or trade mark would
not take it outside the purview of the term 'royalty'. It may be that the
knowledge imparted is only contractually protected. It may even be that there
is no protection for the knowledge so granted. Even so the observations which
we have set out above clearly show that the form of legal protection has no
conclusive impact in determining whether payment is 'royalty' or not, nor the
nature and mode of payment whether lump sum, single, or periodic, nor the
question that it does not cover know- how. The dictionary meanings of the term
'royalty' relied on by the learned counsel for the assessee and adverted to in
paragraph 18 of our order are only indicative of circumstances to which
payments can be considered to be royalty and are not exhaustive as to the
content of the term."
4.4.4 In general, the concept of royalty is a payment for use of a property,
the ownership of which remains with the developer and only a limited right is
given to the user. It is not necessary that the property should be protected
by a statute.
4.5. Why separate clauses for Royalty and FTS 4.5.1 The section 9(1)(vi) of
the Act was introduced by the Finance Act, 1976 w.e.f 01.01.1977. The CBDT
circular No. 202 explained the intention of the legislation in this regard as
under -
"Source rule for "royalty"--Section 9(1)(vi) 38 Reliance and Lucent Group 15.1
A non-resident taxpayer is chargeable to tax in India in respect of income by
way of royalty, which is received or is deemed to be received in India or
which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise in India. The Income-
tax Act, however, does not contain any definition of the term "royalty" nor is
there any clear-cut source rule specifying the circumstances in which royalty
income can be regarded as accruing or arising in India. Further, lump sum
payments made for the supply of know-how are not chargeable to tax where such
know-how is supplied from abroad and the payment therefore is made outside
India even though the know-how is used in India, if no part thereof is
attributable to any services rendered in India.
15.2 The Finance Act has inserted a new clause (vi) in section 9(1) of the
Income-tax Act clearly specifying the circumstances in which the royalty
income will be deemed to accrue or arise in India and also defining the term
"royalty"
15.4 In view of the aforesaid amendment, royalty income consisting of lump sum
consideration for the transfer outside India of, or the imparting of
information outside India in respect of, any data, documentation, drawings or
specifications relating to any patent, invention, model, design, secret
formula or process or trade mark or similar property, will ordinarily become
chargeable to tax in India.
15.5 For the purposes of the aforesaid source rule, "royalty" has been defined
in Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi). It will be seen that the definition is
wide enough to cover both industrial royalties as well as copyright royalties.
Further, the definition specifically excludes income which would be chargeable
to tax under the head "Capital gains" and accordingly such income will be
charged to tax as capital gains on a net basis under the relevant provisions
of the law.
4.5.2 From the above it can be seen that the intention of the legislation is
very clear and the same is to bring to tax all payments made for the
acquisition of know how in any form, where the source of payment is in India.
This is in accordance with the internationally recognized and accepted
principle on distribution of tax revenue between source state and resident
state. The OECD model and UN model convention on tax treaties have separate
clause for taxation of royalty in the source state. 4.6. Definition of Royalty
under domestic law 4.6.1 The relevant section 9(1 )(vi) of the Income Tax Act
1961 reads as under-
9(1). The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India:
.........
(vi) income by way of royalty payable by-
(a) the Government; or
(b) a person who is a resident, except where the royalty is payable in respect
of any right, property or information used or services utilised for 39
Reliance and Lucent Group the purposes of a business or profession carried on
by such person outside India or for the purposes of making or earning any
income from any source outside India; or
(c) a person who is a non-resident, where the royalty is payable in respect of
any right, property or information used or services utilised for the purposes
of a business or profession carried on by such person in India or for the
purposes of making or earning any income from any source in India:"
4.6.2 It can be seen that section 9(1)(vi)(b) provides that if a resident
makes a payment to a non-resident, the such sum payable shall be deemed to be
income of the payee accruing or arising in India if the following two
conditions are satisfied -
i. The payment should be in the nature of royalty as defined under explanation
2 to the sub section.
ii. The purpose of the payment should be neither for the business carried out
by such person outside India nor for making or earning an income from a source
outside India.
4.6.3 The assessee's basic argument is that the payment does not fall under
the mischief of explanation 2 to section 9(1(vi) of the Act. The term Royalty'
has been defined under Explanation 2 to Section 9(1)(vi) of the Act to mean:
"consideration (including any lump sum consideration but excluding any
consideration which would be the Income of the recipient chargeable under the
head "Capital gains") for -
(i) the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) In
respect of a patent Invention, model, design, secret formula or process or
trade mark or similar pro petty;
(ii) the imparting of any information concerning the working of, or the use
of, a patent, Invention, model, design, secret formula or process or trade
mark or similar property;
(iii) the use of any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or
process or trademark, or similar property;
(iv) the imparting of any information concerning technical, Industrial,
commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or skill; (iva) the use or
right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, but not
including the amounts referred to in section 4488;
(v) the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in
respect of any copyright literary, artistic or scientific work including films
or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in
connection with radio broadcasting, but not including consideration for the
sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films; or 40 Reliance and
Lucent Group
(vi) the rendering of any services in connection with the activities referred
to in sub-clauses (I) to (iv), (iva) and (v)" 4.6.4 An analysis of the above
definition of royalty would show the following categories fall under the scope
of royalty -
> (i) Patents, designs, invention, secret formula, process etc.
> (ii) Information concerning technical, industrial or commercial or
> scientific knowledge etc.
> (iii) Equipment - Industrial, commercial or scientific.
(iv) Literary, artistic or scientific work 4.6.5 In the case of first three
categories, payment for mere use is the royalty whereas in the fourth
category, the royalty arises only when copyright right is transferred. The
next question would be, whether items like design, invention etc. are not the
scientific work or in other words whether categories (i) to (iii) and (iv) are
mutually exclusive or overlapping? There can not be any dispute on the fact
that invention, design, secret formula or process are in the nature of
scientific work. Thus, the four categories are not mutually exclusive. The
only inference one can draw is that the first two categories represent
intangible properties whereas the third and fourth category includes all kinds
of properties. In the case of intangible property, even a mere use of it would
attract the provisions of royalty whereas in the case of tangible properties,
only when a copyright right is transferred, it would fall under the scope of
royalty. Only exception in the case of tangible properties is the equipment.
The use of equipment is also covered by the scope of royalty w.e.f.
01/04(2002.
4.6.6 The clauses (i) and (iii) refers to the same category of properties i.e
patent, invention, model etc. In clause (i). payment of "transfer of any
right" in respect of such properties but clause (iii) refers to actual 'use'
of such properties. What is the distinction between a 'right to use' and
'use'. It can be understood by a simple example of taking a house on rent
vis-a vis subletting to a third party- In this case, a tenant as well as
subtenant pay rent. A tenant makes the payment for his right to use whereas
the sub tenant pays for actual use of the house. Similar is the situation when
a vendor in India acquires know-how from abroad and sells it to actual user.
In this case the vendor acquires a right to use covered by clause (i) whereas
the actual user pays for actual use covered by clause (iii) of the
explanation.
4.6.7 Thus as per the provisions of Sec.9(1)(vi) of the income Tax Act 1961,
any payment on account of Royalty made by the Resident of India to any person
outside India is deemed to be income of the recipient in India, and would be
deemed to be the income chargeable to income tax in India. One has now to
examine whether such payments partake the character of "Royalty" as defined in
the Sec.9(1)(vi) itself, As discussed above, clause (i) to (iv) are applicable
In the case of intangible property and payment for its mere use is in the
nature of royalty. As mentioned 41 Reliance and Lucent Group above, software
Is not goods but an intangible property. Hence consideration paid for its use
or right to use is in the nature of royalty. 4.7. Whether "process"? -
4.7.1 Alternative to the above discussion, it is to be seen whether 'software'
fits into one of the categories mentioned in clause (i) and (iii) of
explanation 2 to Sec.9(1)(vi). Klaus Vogel in his commentary on the phrase
'secret formula or processes' has stated that definition cover know-how in a
narrower sense of the term, viz, all business secrets of a commercial or
industrial nature [Para 59/Article 12~. In most countries, they enjoy at least
a relative protection or are capable of being protected. 4.7.2 In New Skies
Satellites vs. ADIT (ITAT Delhi Special Bench) ITA no 5385-87/2004 (Decision
dated 16/10(2009) it was held that the provision of the transponder through
which the telecasting companies are able to uplink the desired images/data and
downlink the same in the desired area is a "process". To constitute "royalty",
it is not necessary that the process should be a "secret process". The fact
there is a 'comma' after the words "secret formula or process" in the DTM does
not mean that a different interpretation has to be given to the DIM as
compared to the Act.
It was further held that the argument that there is no "use" of the satellite
by the payer as it has no control or possession of the satellite is not
acceptable. To constitute "royalty", it is not necessary that the instruments
through which the "process" is carried on should be in the control or
possession of the payer. The context and factual situation has to be kept in
mind to determine that whether the process was "used" by the payer. In the
case of satellites physical control and possession of the process can neither
be with the satellite companies nor with the telecasting companies. The fact
that the telecasting companies are enabled to telecast their programmes by
uplinking and downlinking the same with the help of that process shows that
they have "use" of the same. Time of telecast and the nature of programme, all
depends upon the telecasting companies and, thus they are using that process;
4.7.3 The 'process' has been defined in Ordinary Dictionary as "a particular
course of action intended to achieve a result". It is a co- cordinated set of
actions that produce a result. White Information Technology has automated
specific tasks for pre-defined workflow, the advent of web services opens the
prospect of automating the entire end- to-end processes without sacrificing
business agility. 4.7.4 As per Corpus Juris Secundum, the meaning of the term
"process" as understood n Patent Laws is:
> * A mode, method or operation whereb~' a result or effect is produced.
> * a means devised for the production of a given result. * an operation done
> by rule in order to secure a result.
> 42 Reliance and Lucent Group This is exactly how a software works - in a
> series of instructions/ operations to achieve a desired result. The program
> which instructs a computer to perform the desired operation often goes
> through a series of evolutionary steps from preliminary conception to
> detailed and complex expression. In this process (which varies from case to

there is, for instance, the possibility that principles which might be written
into programs are instead given expression in the circuitry of the computer,
and the possibility of writing programs that will bring about the co-operation
of a network of computers.
4.7.5 Whether software is a "process' or not can be judged from the litigation
that existed in the developed countries on the issue whether a particular
software can be patented or not. In all these cases, it was argued that an
invention in the form of a technical process was developed. Some of these
cases are as below:- -
> i. (Koch and Sterzel : Program governing the operation of a technical
> device). A claim to X-ray apparatus controlled by a computer program so as
> to secure optimal exposure without overloading the X-ray tube was held
> patentable by an EPO Board of Appeal. It sufficed that 'technical means'
> were involved as well as the mathematical method or algorithm, which was
> characterized as 'non-technical'. It was not necessary to show that
> invention lay exclusively or largely in the former domain.
> ii. Victom's Application: (Computer operating program in a industrial
> technique). A claim is patentable to a computer so Programmed (or provided
> with hardware) as to be able to process digital images in accordance with a
> given mathematical procedure expressed as an algorithm. The program had been
> developed for computer aided design (CAD) of engineering and similar
> products, and the application was upheld once the claim was amended so as to
> cover only uses which started with a computerized image; the original claim
> was for less specific methods of using the algorithm. The claim was 43
> Reliance and Lucent Group accepted because it was directed to a 'technical
> process'. At root, what mattered was that CAD is a widely used and most
> valuable aid to product design.
> iii. Merrill Lynch's Application : application program for analyzing data).
> The claimed program could be used in an automated market for shares and
> similar securities. It analysed customer's orders to buy and sell against
> given criteria; those which met the criteria were then carried out. The
> Court of Appeal held this unpatentable under the 1977 Act. The program could
> be introduced into any suitable computer in any encoding language, causing
> data to be acted upon so as to carry out legal transactions, rather than
> technical production in any ordinary sense.
> iv. Gale's Application : new method of calculation). The applicant's
> essential discovery was of a method of calculating square roots in the
> binary functioning of a computer by eliminating division and restricting
> multiplication to specified binary functions. This could be given form in
> the electronic circuitry of a read-only memory (ROM) and the claim was to a
> ROM carrying the relevant controls. Aldous J. was prepared to accept the
> claim; but the Court of Appeal refused the application for its very apparent
> reference to mathematical procedures for producing numbers. The Court
> refused to accept in such a case that embodiment in a ROM made to program
> patentable, where it would not be if expressed purely in mathematical terms
> or was contained on a floppy disk for insertion in a computer.
4.7.6 The distinction between the securing of a technical effect in the
`nature of a new invention and the mere production and manipulation of
information has been made for the purpose of deciding patentability but the
fact remains that all these software involve a process, the term which is much
wider in scope than patent It was introduced in order to confine the exclusion
of computer programs as such within a limited compass, itself an approach
founded on a belief that the patent system should be open to 'innovative
technology' in a broad sense. Programming include specialized skills such as
mathematical procedure for the calculation of square roots; the conversion of
binary decimal numbers into pure binary numbers the compilation of a source
program in high-level language into object code, whether a number is a prime
number or not. Such concepts and combinations of them represent technical know
how. Networking of computers, which are linked together physically, the
program instructions which bring about the efficient co-operation of the
various stations has the 'feel' of larger technology.
4.7.7 In view of the above discussion, it is held that software is a process
used by a computer to achieve a desired result.
44 Reliance and Lucent Group 4.8. Whether "a similar property"
4.8.1 Clauses (i) and (iii) of the explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi) defining
'royalty' use the term "a similar property". It means a property which is
similar to a patent, design, trademark, secret formula, process etc. Let us
discuss what these terms mean and what is common about all of them. 4.8.2.
What is a patent?
If you have invented something, you can get a patent to protect it. A patent
is a document which gives you the right to stop other persons from making,
copying, using or selling your information. Patents are the oldest and
strongest form of intellectual property. There is a rigorous examination
procedure where the scope of the patent claims is tested, and searches are
made for anticipation of the invention by others. 4.8.3. What is a design?
If you have created a new design (a new shape, form or appearance of an
article), you can protect your design by registering it. There are two
different types of designs which can be registered. i.) An aesthetic design -
just for the beauty of the shape configuration or ornamentation. ii.) A
functional design, where the shape, configuration is necessitated by the
function.
4.9.2 The Second Proviso to section 9(1 )(vi) of the Act itself state as
under:
"Provided further that nothing contained in this clause shall apply in
relation to so much of the income by way of royalty as consists of lump sum
payment made by a person, who is a resident, for the transfer of all or any
rights (including the granting of a license) in respect of computer software
supplied by a non-resident manufacturer along with a computer or computer-
based equipment under any scheme approved under the Policy on Computer
Software Export, Software Development and Training, 1986 of the Government of
India."
4.9.3 It shows that when computer software is acquired along with equipment,
then consideration paid for the software will not be royalty if the agreement
is approved by the specified authority of the Govt of India. In other words,
if the agreement is not approved then payment for acquisition of such software
would be taxable. It is also important to note here that the legislation has
not used the word "copyright" as used in clause (iv) of the explanation
defining royalty. In this regard, circular no 621 dated 19/1211991 issued by
the Central Board of Direct Taxes explains the circumstances as under -
34.3 At present, the value of software in a physical form such as magnetic
tape or disc imported into India is subjected to custom duty on the ground
that what is imported is commodity. At the same time. since import of software
is generally under a license from the foreign licensor, the lump sum payments
made for using the software are regarded as payment of royalty within the
meaning under Explanation 2 of section 9(1)(vi) of the Income-tax Act and
taxed accordingly.
45 Reliance and Lucent Group 34.4 In order to prevent this dual levy, the
Income-tax Act has been amended to provide that any lump sum payment for
obtaining use of systems software supplied by a non-resident manufacturer
along with the computer hardware will not be subjected to income-tax. This tax
concession will not be available in relation to payments in respect of system
software imported otherwise than under an approved Computer Software Export
Scheme or where the software is supplied separately or independently of the
computer hardware even though the software has been developed or marketed by
the supplier of the computer hardware. 4.9.4 This position was again
reiterated in circular No.794 of 2000 as under:
7.1 Under the existing provisions, section 9 lists the income that is deemed
to accrue or arise in India, However, any royalty income in the hands of the
non-resident manufacturer received from a resident person or the Government
for the transfer of rights in respect of computer software along with a
computer or computer-based equipment under an approved scheme is excluded from
the deeming provisions of section 9. This circular was intended to remove any
doubt that a software supplied with a license in India will be taxable as
royalty under section 9(1)(vi) of the Act.
4.10. Sub section (IA) of section 115A of the Act 4.10.1 Further, taxability
of income of import of software has been amply clear in the Income Tax Act
through sec. 11 5A (which deals with tax on dividends, royalty and technical
services fees in the case of foreign companies) wherein it has been provided
under (1A) as under: "Where the royalty referred to in clause (b) of sub-
section (1) is in consideration for the transfer of all or any rights
(including the granting of a license) in respect of copyright in any book to
an Indian concern or in respect of any computer software to a person resident
in India, the provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to such
royalty as if the words the agreement is approved by the Central Government or
where it relates to a matter included in the industrial policy, for the time
being in force, of the Government of India, the agreement is in accordance
with that policy occurring in the said clause had been omitted." 4.10.2
Section 115 provides rates of tax in respect of royalty, FTS, .dividend and
interest payments to non-residents. It may be noted that different wordings
have been used in the subsection (IA) for books and for software. In case of
books, it says payment for transfer of 'any right in respect of copyright'
whereas in case of software it simply says transfer of 'any right in respect
of software'. The word copyright has not been used in the case of software.
Rightlyso, as discussed earlier, a book is a tanalble property whereas
software is an intannible property. As per section 9(1)(vi) defining royalty,
in case of Intangible property consideration for mere use of such property
will be in the nature of royalty whereas in case of tangible property (other
than equipment), royalty would arise only for transfer of copyright right.
46 Reliance and Lucent Group 4.10.3 Section 80HHE was introduced in the Act
w.e.f 1.4.1991 for granting deduction in respect of profits from export of
software. The need arose mainly because such profits were not entitled for
deduction u/s 80HHC as the software was not considered as goods or
merchandise. 4.11. Meaning of Copyright 4.11.1 If you create an original work
that people can see or hear, you can get copyright. Having copyright means
that you own that work and you can control its commercial use. Your copyright
can protect your work from being copied or reproduced without your permission.
If you have an original idea, you cannot have copyright in it. You must put
your original idea into a physical form, such as a book, a card, a CD, a
painting, a picture, a screenplay or a film.
4.11.2 Authors of creative works in respect of such works and by reason of
their creation, enjoy a right of exclusive ownership vis-â-vis all ¼ 'other
persons, referred to as "copyright", the protection of which shall be
organized by the law. According to the Copyright Act,1956 of India, copyright
exists in a work (section 13). The 'work' has been defined under section 2(y)
as literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, a cinematographic film and a
sound recording. The 'computer Program' has been defined under section 2(ffc)
as a set of instructions expressed in words, codes, schemes or in any other
form capable of causing a computer to perform a particular task or achieve a
particular result. Section 2(o) of act specifies that literary work includes
computer programs. tables and compilations including computer databases.
"Copyright under section 14 means the exclusive right subject to the
provisions of this act, to do or authorise the doing of any of the following
acts in respect of a work or any substantial part thereof , namely,
(a) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a computer
Program,
(i) to reproduce the work in many material form including the storing of it in
any medium by electronic means.
(ii) to issue copies of the work to the public not being copies already in
circulation;
(iii) to perform the work in public, or communicate it to the public;
(iv) to make any cinematograph film or sound recording in respect of the work;
    (v)       to make any transaction of the work;
    (vi)     to make any adaptation of the work;
    (vii)     to do, in relation or an adaptation of the work, any of the acts
specified in relation to the work in sub-clause (i) to (vi).
(b) in the case of a computer Program:
(i) to do any of the acts specified in clause (a);
(ii) to sell or give on commercial rental or offer for sale or for 47 Reliance
and Lucent Group commercial rental any copy of the computer Program: PROVIDED
that such commercial rental does not apply in respect of computer programs
where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental.
4.11.3 That means the owner of the copyright in a computer software has now 8
rights instead of conventional 7 rights [ as per clause (a) of section 14
(supra) 1. Even right to sell or giving on commercial rent is included in the
software. In the A.A.R. case of Factset Systems (AAR No.787 of 2008) these
rights appear to be not considered, It may be worthwhile to .point out that,
similar rights were also introduced in the US Copyright Act. Sec. 109A of the
US Copyright Act [as amended in 1990] states: "Notwithstanding the provisions
of the Sub-sec.(a), unless authorised by the owners of the copyright in the
sound recording or the owner of copyright in the computer Program (including
any tape, disk or other media embodying such Program), and the case of sound
recording in the musical works embodied therein, neither the owner of the
particular phonorecord nor any person in possession of a particular copy of a
computer Program (including any tape, disk or other media embodying such
Program), may for the purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage,
dispose of, or authorise the disposal of the possession of that phonorecord or
computer Program (including any tape, disk or other media embodying such
Program), by rental, lease, or lending, or by any other Act or practice in the
nature of rental, lease or lending. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall
apply to the rental, lease or lending a phonorecord for non-profit purpose by
a non-profit library or non-profit educational institution."
From the above it can be seen that in the present case, a user of the computer
software in India has obtained a copyright right of the assessee i.e. right to
use on commercial hire. Thus, payment for acquisition of software by it is
also consideration for transfer of any right in respect of copyright in
software. Thus the argument of applicant that the Copyright Act is not
applicable is not the correct position. 4.12. Whether sale of "Copyrighted
Item" or transfer of "Copyright Right"?
4.12.1 It is argued that software acquired is a copyrighted item and not the
copyright right. For instance in the case of a book, when the books are sold,
it is the sale of copyrighted item but when a right to copy is given to a
distributor who in turn makes copies and sales books, it is said that the
distributor has acquired a copyright right. The payment for copyright right is
royalty and not for copyrighted item. 4.12.2 The above statement is correct
when we are dealing with tangible properties like books, paintings, model etc
because these are the end products in themselves. This is not correct in the
case of intangible properties like software, designs etc. Royalties are two
types - copyright royalties and know-how royalties. In case of later, the
payment for mere use would qualify as royalty. For instance standardized
design for 48 Reliance and Lucent Group construction of a particular type of
bridge. The developer only gives a right to use to the payer. The design is
given in the form of a booklet with detailed drawings etc. It is in the
physical form but it does not qualify as a tangible property or a copyrighted
item. It comes under the know-how royalty. Similar is the case of software.
Even the standardized software will fall under the category of know how
royalty.
4.12.3 If it is presumed that software on carrier media disks or tapes is an
copyrighted article and not an intangible property, then sale of software on a
CD will not be royalty but if the same software is downloaded on internet with
the permission of developer, it would not be an article. Consequently it would
be in the nature of royalty. It would be a totally untenable interpretation
which changes taxability of a payment for acquisition of the same property on
the basis of method of delivery. Such an interpretation cannot be accepted.
4.12.4 At this juncture, it would be appropriate to borrow from the
Commentaries by Eminent Authors before arriving at a finding in this matter.
OECD Commentary vide para 15 states that where consideration is paid for the
transfer of the full ownership, the payment can not represent a royalty and
the provisions of the article are not applicable. Difficulties can arise where
there are extensive but partial alienation of rights involving -
> \- exclusive right of use during a specific period or in a limited
> geographic area;
> \- additional consideration related to usage;
> \- consideration in the form of a substantial lumpsum payments.
Reference to Klaus Vogel's Commentary on Double Taxation Conventions shows
that in Canada, payment for using of software by virtue of contract, where the
Program is kept confidential, amounts to payment for use of secret formula and
hence amounts to royalty payment. A similar view is taken in United States as
referred to in para 29 of the Commentary by Vogel which states as under:
"29. The United States believes that in interpreting the definition of
'royalties' in para 2 of the article, with respect to payments for software,
it should be understood that where a payment for the acquisition of software
for the personal or business use of the purchaser is measured by reference to
the productivity or use of such software, the payment may represent a royalty
under the article." [Para 36b] Relevant paras from Vogel's Commentary at P.783
(2005 edition, Indian reprint 2007) are reproduced below:
12\. "[Consideration for software] Whether payments received as consideration
for computer software may be classified as royalties poses difficult problems
but is a matter of considerable importance in view of the rapid development of
computer technology in recent years and the extent of transfers of such
technology across national borders. Software may be described as a program, or
series of programs, containing 49 Reliance and Lucent Group instructions for a
computer required either for the operational. processes of the computer itself
(operational software) or for the accomplishment of other tasks (application
software). It can be transferred through a variety of media, for example in
writing, on a magnetic tape or disc, or on a laser disc. It may be
standardised with a wide range of applications or be tailor made for single
users. It can be transferred as an integral part of computer hardware or in an
independent form available for use on a variety of hardware. The rights In
computer software are a form of intellectual property. Research into the
practices of OECD Member countries has established that all but one protect
software rights either explicitly or implicitly under copyright law. Transfers
of rights occur in many different ways ranging from the alienation of the
entire rights to the sale of a product which is subject to restrictions on the
use to which it is put. The consideration paid can also take numerous forms.
These factors may make it difficult to determine where the boundary lies
between software payments that are properly to be regarded as royalties and
other typos of payment".
4.12.5 Several important points have been considered while coming to the
conclusion that supply of software by the assessee will be chargeable to tax
as Royalty. The definition of copyright as per Sec.14(b) of the Copyright Act,
1957 with regard to software has been considered. The perusal of this
definition clearly indicated that in the case of computer programmes, selling
or giving on hire of the software or offering for sale or for commercial
rental any copy of the computer programme regardless of whether such a copy
has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasion constitute the grant of a
right to use copyrights. The said definition makes it clear that copy of
legally obtained software constitutes grant of exercise of the copyright.
Article 3(2) of the Indo-US DTAA makes it mandatory to adopt the definition of
the word 'copyright' as given in the law of the state applying the provisions
of the treaty and therefore, definition as given in Indian Copyright Act, 1957
shall be applicable in the present case. Neither Indian Copyright Act, 1957
nor any Circular issued by the CBDT makes any distinction between Copyright
and Copyrighted article and such distinction made in US regulations cannot be
extended to Indian territories and only laws promulgated by the Indian
sovereign have to be applied. Further, the 'Royalty is a very wide term under
the Income Tax Act and under the DTAA and it covers other aspects of the
intellectual property also besides the transfer of the copyright right like
process, equipment covered by explanation 2(iva) to sec.9(1)(vi).
4.13. Conclusion under Domestic Law 4.13.1 It is an admitted position of law
that when the owner of any Intellectual Property (IP) licenses it (the IP) to
others for use and/or exploitation, he charges a fee, which is called Royalty.
Copyrights, patents, designs, trademarks, formula, process, commercial!
scientific knowledge etc, are all classic forms of intellectual property
rights and which have been mentioned in the definition -of Royalty. However,
with the advent of modern technology, software has now been added to this 50
Reliance and Lucent Group list of IPs. As there is no doubt that software are
IPs, consideration paid for the license to use the software (even though these
do not specially appear in the definition of Royalty) should, by first
principle, fall under the category-Royalty. To sum up
a) Software is not goods or tangible property but intangible intellectual
property.
b) Software is 'process" as mentioned in clause (I) and (iii) of the
explanation 2 defining royalty.
c) Alternately, software is a property similar to patent, invention, design,
secret formula, process etc.
d) The CBDT in circular no 621 of 19/1 2/1991 .has categorically stated that
payment for acquisition of software under a license is royalty. The intention
of the legislation in subsequent amendments i.e. second proviso to sec 9(1
)(vi), sect 11 5A(1 A) and 8OHHE is clear in this regard.
4.13.2 In view of the above, it is held that payment made by the assessee for
use, or right to use software is in the nature of royalty liable to tax in
India under domestic law.
4.14 Conclusion under treaty law:
4.14.1 The term 'royalty' has been defined in a different way under most of
the double tax avoidance treaties India has with different countries. The
definition of royalty as per Article 12(3) of Indo-USA treaty is as under -
(a) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the
right to use, any copyright of a literary, artistic, or scientific work,
including cinematograph films or work on film, tape or other means of
reproduction for use in connection with radio or television broadcasting any
patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for
information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience1
including gains derived from the alienation of any such right or property
which are contingent on the productivity1 use or disposition thereof; and
(b) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the
right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, other than
payments derived by an enterprise described in paragraph I of article 8
(Shipping and Air Transport) from activities described in paragraph 2(c) or 3
of article 8.
4.14.2 Basic structure of the term royalty in the treaty is same as in the
domestic law. For instance it refers to the following categories which are
also there in domestic law-
> i) patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process
> ii) information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience
> 51 Reliance and Lucent Group
> ii) industrial, commercial or scientific equipment
> iv) literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films.
4.14.3 Similar to domestic law, mere use of first three categories is royalty
and in the case of fourth category it is the copyright right. The minor
differences are-
i) In case of first category, instead of 'transfer of any right', the treaty
uses the word "right to use"
ii) The treaty uses specific words 'copyright of literary, artistic or
scientific work' whereas domestic law says "copyright, literary, artistic or
scientific work".
iii) The treaty does not use the word a similar property".
iv) There is a comma after the phrase 'secret formula or process"
> which is not there in the domestic law using the same phrase as "secret
> formula or process or .......". It means the word secret should also be
> applied to the word process. So, to qualify as royalty it should be a secret
> process.
4.14.4 The above differences do not change the position in respect of software
once they are classified as process. They are also secret because the source
code is not given to the user. The use of secret process implies use of a
process which is secret i.e. not available in public domain. It is not
necessary that the secret should be divulged to the user. In the present world
of technology, it is possible to allow others to use a process without
disclosing the secrecy of the process. - For instance, the working of a
software which can determine whether a number is prime number or not, is a
secret process. The user of such software uses the process without knowing how
the software works. Thus the payment for use of software is for use of a
secret process. Consequently, the payment would be in the nature of royalty.
4.15 Thus income relatable to the supply of software under the present
contract answers to the description of royalty, as the software in question
are copyrights which have been given to Reliance Communications Ltd., for use.
Since the provisions of the Act and the DTM are very clear on this point, no
reference to the Copyright Act or to any other source appears necessary.
4.16 Without prejudice to the fact that use of software program on computer
will amount to transfer of copyright under section 14 of the Copyright Act,
the payment will also be covered as the payment for use of secret process.
Further, the software in general is an intellectual property and allowing its
use by sale or by renting is covered by Royalty. 4.17.1 The impact of
introduction of explanation 2(iva) to set 9(1)(vi) was lucidly considered by
the Hon'ble ITAT, Hyderabad and it held in case of M/S Front tine soft Limited
ITA no 1080-1O81/Hyd/03 held vide para 22,23,24 and 27 as below:
52 Reliance and Lucent Group
22\. We have heard the (earned representatives of patties and record perused.
The issue to be examined under consideration is whether impugned payment made
to TDT against purchases of software or payment of Royalty. After elaborate
discussion on the issue while deciding the first ground we find that what is
taxed as royalties is the amount paid as consideration for the use or the
right to use and not outright purchase or the fight to use as an asset Royalty
is thus consideration for the transfer of all or any right including the
granting of a license in respect of a copyright, patent, trade mark, design
and modal or secret formula, the use or right to use any industrial,
commercial or scientific equipment (section 9(1)(vi), explanation 2. (iva))
transfer of the 'fight in the property' is not the subject matter. It is the
transfer of the 'fight in respect of the property'~ The two transfers are
distinct and have different legal effects. In one right are purchased which
enables use of those fights, while in the other the purchase is involved, only
the right to use has been granted. Ownership denotes the relationship between
a person and an object forming the subject matter of his ownership. It
consists of a complex of rights all of which rights are tights in pm petty
being good against all the world and not merely against a specific person and
such rights are indeterminate in duration and residuary in character. That sum
may be agreed for the transfer of one right, two rights and so on but not the
ownership. Thus, the definition in respect of software etc. does not extend to
the outright purchase of the right to use an asset A payment for the absolute
assignment and ownership of rights transferred is not a payment for the use of
something belonging to another party and therefore, not royalty. In an
outright transfer to be treated as sale/purchase of property as opposed to
license, alienation of all rights in the properly is necessary. This
distinction has been recognised and given effect to in the following judicial
pronouncements.
1) CIT. Vs. Davy Ashmore India Ltd (1991) 190 ITR 626 (Cal) = (2OO3-
TIOL-2O7-HC-KOL-IT) "The term 'royalty has been defined in the Agreement to
mean, inter alia, the payment of any kind including rentals received as a
consideration for the use of or the right to use any patent, trade mark design
or model, plan, secret formula or process. It is important that, in order that
a payment may be treated as royalty for the purposes of article XIII of the
agreement for avoidance of Double Taxation between India and the U.K., the
person who is the owner of such patents, designs or models, plans, secret
formula or process, etc., retains the property in them and permits the use or
allows the right to use such patents, designs or models, plans, secret
formula, etc. In other words, where the transferor retains the property right
in the designs, secret formula, etc. and allows the use of such right, the
consideration received for such user is in the nature of royalty. Where,
however, there is an outright sale or purchase, the consideration is for the
transfer of such designs, secret formula. etc., and cannot be treated as
royalty." (relevant headnote)
2) C.I.T. Vs Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico Printing Co. (1983) 139 ITR 806(Guj) =
(2003-TIOL-210-HC-AHM-IT) 53 Reliance and Lucent Group "In the case of secret
processes, patents, special inventions, when right of exploitation is given by
the owner of the inventions, patents etc., to a third party instead of
outright sale, then for the right to exploit these inventions, secret
processes, some amount may be paid and the amount paid may be correlated to
the extent of exploitation. It is in this '~ sense that license agreements for
the exploitation of patents, inventions, etc. are being entered into in modem
commercial would and as part of such agreements, even knowledge derived from
his own experience and technical know-how for the most economical and
efficient user of the patents, inventions, etc. are parted with by the
licensor to the license. Payments of this kind are known as royalties. This is
also evident from several double taxation avoidance agreements between the
Govt. of India and foreign countries such as Sweden in which the term
'Royalty' has been defined. That such payments are royalties is also evident
from the definition of the word 'Royalty' in section 9(1)(vi), Explanation 2,
which was subsequently introduced by the Finance Act, 1976, with effect from
June 1, 1976) (Relevant head note)."
23\. In OECD commentary it is stated that the character of payments received
in transactions involving the transfer of computer software depends on the
nature of the rights that the transferee acquires under the particular
arrangement regarding the use and exploitation of the pro gram. The rights in
computer programs are a form of intellectual property. Research into the
practices of OCED member countries has established that all but one protects
rights in computer programs either explicitly or implicitly under copy right
law. Although the term 'computer software' is commonly used to describe both
the program in which the intellectual property rights (copy right) subsist and
the medium on which it is embodied, the copyright law of most OECD member
countries recognises a distinction between the copyright in the program and
software which Incorporates a copy of the copyrighted program. Transfer of
rights in relation to software occur in many different ways ranging from the
alienation of the entire rights in the copyright in a program to the sale of a
product which )~ subject to restrictions on the use to which it is on the use
to which it is put The consideration paid can also take numerous forms. These
factors may make it difficult to determine where the boundary lies between
software payments that are properly to be regarded as royalties and other
types of payment The difficulty of determination is compounded by the case of
reproduction of computer software, and by the fact that acquisition of
software frequently entails the making of a copy by the acquirer in order to
make possible the operation of the software. Various countries have given
different treatment of royalties despite OECD recommendation. Indian DTAAs
already contained pro visions for taxing equipment rental as royalties, but
domestic law did not have specific provisions till 2002-03. The Finance Act
2001 inserted clause (iv) (a) in sections 90) (vi), Explanation 2 to bring
about a result diametrically opposite to the OCED recommendations. The said
clause is reproduced as below:
54 Reliance and Lucent Group (iva) the use or right to use any industrial,
commercial or scientific equipment but not including the amounts referred to
in section 44BB;
24\. Where the domestic law is clear, unambiguous and does not suffer from any
void or gap, the spirit or intention of international convention, under no
circumstances, can override the express provisions of domestic law.
.......
26\. With the above background of discussion now we examine the facts of the
case under consideration, we find that in the impugned transactions of payment
to TDT was for the use of 'True Dial Software' and not for purchases, as
evident from following clauses of terms and conditions of the agreement:
.......
27\. From above terms and conditions we find that the said payment was not for
transfer of absolute assignment and ownership of "True Dial Software" The
transaction clearly, falls under the definition of 'Royalty' as defined in
section 9fl)(vi) Explanation 2 (iva). The assessee acquired only right to use
of 'True Dial Software". It is 'Royalty' and royalty payment to NRI is deemed
to accrue and arises in India and therefore, payment is subject to tax
deducted at sources. We them fore, confirm the orders of the lower
authorities.
4.17.2 Recently Karnataka High Court in CIT vs. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.
(2009) 185 Taxman 313 (Kar) held that for the import of software the tax as
'Royalty" has to be deducted and answered in para 90 of the order Q.No. 2, 3,
4 as below:
    Sr.      Substantial questions raised                   Answers
    No.
    1        ........
    2        Whether the Tribunal is correct in holding     Not correct. In the
             that the payments made by the Assessee         negative. against
             Company for purchase of software from          the assessee and

             and Rs. 8,89,611 was not liable to Income-
             tax in India and consequently no TDS as
             held by the Assessing Officer and
             confirmed by the Appellate Commissioner
             needs to have been deducted?
    3        Whether the Tribunal was correct in merely     Definitely wrong,
             following the judgment passed by it in the     answered in the
             case of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. which     negative, against
             has not been accepted by the Revenue and       the assessee and

appealed against before this Hon'ble Court in favour of the where the facts
were not entirely identical Revenue to one subsisting in the present case and
therefore the Tribunal was bound to have recorded an independent finding and
therefore the impugned order is perverse?
4 Whether the Tribunal based on the fact In the negative, that the Assessee
has imported software against the from Aaymetrix Asia Pacific. Singapore;
assessee and in Peritus Software Service Inc., USA and favour of the Astral
Computers Pvt. Ltd. Singapore on Revenue payment of Rs. 3,43,095, Rs.

tax Act; Indian Copyright Act, 1957. the Revised entry on Article 12 of OECD;
the internal Revenue Service Regulation of USA; the Views of the High Powered
Committee on Commerce and other facts and circumstances of the present case
which could have clearly shown that the payments made by the Assessee was
liable to tax in India and consequently the Assessee was bound to be answered
in the negative, against the assessee and in favour of the revenue In the
against assessee favour revenue negative, the and in of the to deduct tax at
source?
22\. This order of AO was passed with the approval of DRP, Mumbai. Hence
assessee Lucent preferred the four appeals to ITAT. The grounds raised by
Lucent common to all years are as under:
> GROUNDS OF APPEAL "1. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in
> law, the Additional Director of Income Tax (International Taxation),
> Range-4, Mumbai ( hereinafter referred to as "the Learned AO") has erred in
> computing the income of the appellant of Rs.30,72,21,521 and raising a
> consequent tax demand of Rs.6,45,16,519 and interest demand of
> s.10,01,61,895 for A.Y. 2003-04, while issuing a single assessment order for
> A.Y. 2003-04, A.Y. 2004-05, A.Y. 2005-06 and A.Y. 2007-08 dated 19 August
> 2010 and thereby not accepting the Appellant's claim for refund of
> Rs.4,60,83,230 alongwith interest.
                                        56                   Reliance and Lucent Group
    Taxability of Income
> 2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
> AO and the Dispute Resolution Panel (hereinafter referred to as "the DRP")
> have erred in holding that the amounts received by the Appellant from supply
> of software to Reliance Communications Limited (previously known as Reliance
> Infocomm Limited) (hereinafter referred to as "Reliance") are "Royalty" in
> nature under the provisions of the Act and under Article 12 of the Double
> Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and USA (hereinafter referred to
> as "DTAA") and thus liable to tax in India.
3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP authorities have erred in holding that Lucent Technologies
Hindustan Private Limited becomes a permanent establishment (hereinafter
referred to as "PE") for the Appellant in India.
4\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Learned
AO and the DRP authorities have erred in holding that that the sale of
software is effectively connected to the PE of the Appellant in India.
5\. Without prejudice to the grounds 2, 3 and 4 above, the on the facts and
circumstances of the case and in law, the Learned AO and the DRP authorities
have erred in not holding that the payments received by the Appellant are not
"Royalty" in nature and there is no PE of the Appellant in India and
accordingly, the receipts of the Appellant are not taxable in India.
Attribution of Income
6\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP have erred in considering that entire receipts from supply of
software to Reliance are attributable to the PE (as mentioned in Ground 3
above) and taxable as per Article 12(6) read with article 7(3) of the DTAA,
thereby taxing the entire receipts from supply of software under section 44D
read with section 115A (1) (b) (A) of the Act.
7\. Without prejudice to ground 6 above (while assuming but not accepting the
existence of a PE in India), the DRP authorities ought to have directed the
Learned AO and consequently, the Learned AO ought to have proceeded to
determine the income attributable to the operations in India and thereafter,
compute and profits attributable to such income of the alleged PE in India (as
the entire receipts from the sale of software are not taxable in India.)
8\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP authorities erred in taking a without prejudice argument that
in the even at any appellate level, provisions of Article 12(6) are not
considered to be applicable, then the receipts from supply of software to
Reliance is to be taxable under Article 12(1)(2) of the DTAA.
9\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Learned
AO and the DRP authorities have erred in taking a without prejudice argument
that in the event it is held that where the receipts from supply of software
to Reliance is not 'royalty' in nature, the business profits of the 57
Reliance and Lucent Group Appellant are to be computed on the basis of the
activities of the PE in India thereby taxing the software receipt on net basis
in India.
10\. Without prejudice to the above, the DRP authorities have erred and
consequently, the Learned AO in arbitrarily estimating that 80% of the
activities are carried out by the PE in India. Further the DRP authorities
have erred in estimating an extremely high net profit rate of 40% on their own
surmises and conjectures and the Learned AO has erred in consequentially
giving effect to the directions of the DRP authorities thereby resulting in
computing the profits attributable to the PE @ 32%, which is very high as
compared to the actual activities carried out in India in relation to the
supply of software.
11\. Without prejudice to the above, the DRP authorities have erred in not
appreciating that all the critical activities in relation to the sale of
software were carried on by the Appellant outside of Indian and all risks
resided outside of India and the Learned AO has erred in consequentially
giving effect to the directions of the DRP authorities thereby resulting in
higher amount of profits being attributed to the PE in India.
12\. On the fact and in the circumstances of the case in law, the DRP
authorities and consequentially, the Learned AO have erred in not considering
and not taking cognizance of the profit attribution study filed before the DRP
to substantiate the profit attribution ratio.
13\. Non-granting of TDS Credit-
i On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the DRP has
erred in not directing and consequently, the Learned AO has erred in not
granting credit of taxes deducted of Rs.4,60,83,230 based on original TDS
certificates submitted alongwith return of income following the provisions of
section 199 of the Act.
ii Without prejudice to the above grounds, on the facts and in the
circumstances of the case, the Appellant contends that if the credit of TDS is
not granted to the Appellant of Rs.4,60,83,230 the amount received by the
Appellant (which is net of TDS) is to be considered as the income of the
Appellant and not the gross receipts as disclosed by the appellant in the
return of income filed.
Levy of Interest
14\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP have erred in levying interest under section 234A of the Act.
15\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP have erred in levying interest under section 234 B of the Act.
16\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP have erred in directing to levy interest under section 234D of
the Act if it is held at any appellate levels that interest under section 234A
or 234B of the Act is not leviable.
                                           58                 Reliance and Lucent Group
                  Penalty
17\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Learned
AO and the DRP have erred in initiating penalty proceedings against the
Appellant under section 271 (1)(c) of the Act."
Ground no 1 is general in nature.
23\. The learned counsel for Lucent, Sr. P.J. Pardiwalla summarised the issues
as under: -
a) Whether proceedings under section 147 are valid
b) Whether the receipts can be considered as Royalty to be taxed as gross
basis
c) If the same are Business profits, is there PE and how much to be attributed
to PE
d) Credit for tax
e) Interest under varies provisions 23.1 With reference to the objection
regarding reopening he referred to page 193 of the paper book and subsequent
filing of ROI to submit that detailed objections are not dealt with by DRP.
However there is no ground raised on the issue in appeal before us.
23.2 With reference to the issue of Royalty, he relied on the various
decisions to support that the sale of software cannot be considered as
Royalty. The learned counsel referred to the agreements before DRP to submit
that the assessee, Lucent, sold only software to run the equipment and
referred to the scope of work in the agreement (Clause 3.1). He referred to
various terms to submit that the sale and supply was outside India, only goods
were supplied at unit prices on fixed price basis and there is no separate
license fee and this software is specified for running the equipment
(equipment specific) and so part of supply of Network agreement. He referred
to the main General Terms and Conditions and Assignment agreement to stress
that the Lucent was acting for supply of hardware and software for Network
establishment and the products are only sold. He relied on the decision of the
Special Bench of ITAT in Motorola 95 ITD 269 (Del) wherein it was considered
that supply of software cannot be considered as Royalty. It 59 Reliance and
Lucent Group was also further submitted that the software supplied is custom
work and no standard software agreement were entered into. He reiterated the
principles laid down by the decision of Motorola (supra) which were in fact
approved in the cases of: -
    1)     DIT vs Nokia Networks OY, 25 taxmann.com 225
    2)     Seimens Aktiengesellschaft 19 ITR (TRIB) 336 (Mumbai)
    3)     DIT vs Ericson AB 204 Taxmann 192.
    4)     Lucent technologies 28 SOT 98
He admitted that there is clear conflict in the decisions of High Courts of
Karnataka and Delhi.
23.3 With reference to the arguments on PE it was submitted that the assessee,
Lucent, acted independently. He referred to the arguments of the AO to submit
that reliance on latter agreement is not correct as that agreement was also
signed by Lucent in which payment obligations were restricted, but Indian
company is not acting as an agent. He then referred to Article 5.4 of DTAA for
terms of 'Agent', 'Force of attraction'. Since there is no fixed place PE and
as nothing was brought on record by Revenue, there is no PE in India to the
Lucent LLC, USA. He relied on the principles laid down in Motorola (supra)
para 127, page 159, 124 and decision in the case of Western Union financial
Services Inc 104 ITD 34 (Del). It was submitted that Indian company is not a
subsidiary of Lucent and it has no authority to conclude agreements. It was
submitted that as the group company may have a PE but the assessee Lucent does
not have PE in India.
23.4 With reference to giving credit of tax, it was the submission that the
issue is decided by the order in the case of Lucent technologies GRL LLC 45
SOT 311( Mum).
23.5 With reference to levy of interest under section 234B/C/D it was
submitted that the TDS was made as per the directions of AO, so as the amount
was covered by TDS provisions, no interest can be levied. Further, he relied
on the decision of NGC Network 313ITR 186 of Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court
to submit that levy of interest does not arise.
60 Reliance and Lucent Group
24\. In response, the learned counsel for the Revenue supported the orders of
AO/DRP. It was his submission that Lucent choose not to file ROI under section
139(1) and so it cannot claim any benefits. Proceedings under section 148 were
initiated for the benefit of Revenue. He referred to the doctrine of election
(written submissions) and relied on case law of K Sudhakar S Shanbagh Vs ITO
241 ITR 865 ( Bom). It was the submission that the Lucent cannot claim any
benefit which was not claimed by filing ROI in time.
24.2 With reference to the arguments on Royalty, Ld. Counsel relied on the
submission made in Revenue appeal. It was the submission that the decision of
Special Bench in the case of Motorola does not apply as the software was not
supplied along with hardware, but separately by separate purchase orders from
a different company, so the factual position is different. He reiterated the
same arguments on use of copyright/use of equipment/ intangible equipment,
etc. 24.3 With reference to the issue of PE, he reiterated the AO's arguments
and referred to 'assignment agreement', clause 7.3.2 for commissioning of
software and Indian company is responsible for installing and commissioning of
the software along with hardware, so agency PE exists. He relied on the orders
on the issue of attribution of profits and levy of interest.
25\. We have heard the contentions in detail and perused the paper books,
various case law placed on record. There is no dispute with reference to the
fact that Reliance purchased various equipments for establishing network and
acquired software from various sources on various agreements which generally
are considered as End User License Agreements (EULA). It was submitted that
the software supplied were standard software which could be supplied to any
other person in Telecommunication business with wireless telecommunication
network. Reliance was granted the right to use the software for its own
business purpose and is permitted to validly use the software for its wireless
network. Pursuant to the supply of software, the LTGL is obliged to provide
product warrantee to ensure that all the software supplied are free from
defects and deficiencies. The LTGL is also responsible 61 Reliance and Lucent
Group to provide service for correcting the defective software, providing
software updates and updates without any additional consideration. It was
submitted that LTGL has not provided any software management services to
Reliance. As already stated above Lucent Technologies Hindustan Pvt. Ltd had
entered into a wireless software contract with Reliance on 31.07.2002 as part
of GTC contract. This contract was subsequently assigned to LTGL on 5th
August, 2002. LTGL supplied software under this agreement. The Reliance
approached the AO for payment without deducting taxes and in all the cases,
taxes were withheld by Reliance as per the orders of the AO. It was the
contention of the parties, considering the terms of the contract/agreement
under which software were supplied to Reliance, the meaning of the term
Royalty, Copyright and Copyrighted Article, the commentaries of OECD model and
UN model tax conventions and various judicial precedents, it was the
contention that the consideration received by the parties from Reliance is in
the nature of business profit and not Royalty. In the absence of any Permanent
Establishment of the respective suppliers in India, the said business
profit/income on supply of software is not taxable in India. These contentions
were more or less accepted by the learned CIT(A) in all the appeals preferred
by the Revenue on the issue.
26\. Many of the arguments regarding provisions of section 5(2), section
9(1)(vi), provisions of section 14 of Copyright Act and section 52(1)(aa) of
Copyright Act, commentaries of OECD, provisions of DTAA with USA and other
countries and arguments that software is 'goods' on the basis of the decision
of the Tata Consultancy Services vs. State of Andhra Pradesh 271 ITR 401, all
other judicial precedents raised before us were also examined and considered
by the Hon'ble Special Bench of the ITAT, Delhi in the case of Motorola Inc.,
Ericsson Radio Systems and Nokia Corporation, 95 ITD 269 (Del). Therefore, we
are not extracting the detailed submissions as we have already extracted the
orders of the CIT(A), which accepted Reliance's contentions and order of the
AO in the case of Lucent for the Revenue's stand. The Hon'ble Special Bench of
the ITAT examined various contentions and held that those assessee companies
were leading suppliers of the said communication equipments comprising both
hardware and software.
62 Reliance and Lucent Group Software could not be effective without hardware,
which was also supplied together. The Special bench of the ITAT on those facts
was of the view that the crux of the issue is "whether the payment is for
copyright or for a copyrighted article". If it is for copyright, it should be
classified as royalty both under the Income-tax Act and under the DTAA and it
would be taxable in the hands of the assessee on that basis. If the payment is
really for a copyrighted article, then it only represents the purchase price
of the article and, therefore, cannot be considered as royalty either under
the Act or under the DTAA. This issue really is the key to the entire
controversy and they proceeded to address the issue. After noticing the
definition of copyright as given in the copyright Act, 1957 in section 14 of
the said Act and referring to the various clauses in the agreement entered
into between the parties and after referring to the various judgments relied
on, on behalf of the parties, it was held that the payment by the cellular
operator is not for any copyright in the software but is only for the
software, as such, as a copyrighted article. It follows that the payment
cannot be considered as royalty within the meaning of Explanation 2 below
section 9(1)(vi) of the Act. Further, it was held that the software supplied
was a copyrighted article and not a copyright and the payment received by the
assessee in respect of the software cannot be considered as 'Royalty' either
under the Act or under DTAA. Recognizing the distinction between Copyright and
Copyrighted Article, it was held that purchase of software along with hardware
is purchase of 'copyrighted article' and no 'copy right' was involved.
27\. This order of the Motorola( supra) on the said facts was approved by the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of DIT vs Erickson AB 204 Taxmann 192 and
also in the case of DIT vs Nokia Networks OY, 25 taxmann.com 225. In the above
cases, the Hon'ble High Court was concerned with the income earned by the
assessee as a result of supply of hardware and software under the supply
agreement wherein such supplies were made overseas. In the case of DIT vs.
Erickson AB 204 Taxman 192, Hon'ble Delhi High Court did not accept the
argument that the software component of the supply should be assessed as
'Royalty' because the software was integral part of GSM mobile telephone
system and was used by 63 Reliance and Lucent Group the cellular operator for
providing cellular services to its customers. It was embedded in the equipment
and could not be independently used. It merely facilitated the functioning of
the equipment and was integral part thereof.
28\. There is no dispute with reference to the principles established by the
Hon'ble Special Bench as approved by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the cases
cited supra. However, what is to be noted in the above judgements is that the
software was supplied along with hardware as part of equipment and there is no
separate sale of software. Software was integral part of supply of equipment
for Tele-communications in those cases. It is generally called embedded
software.
29\. The facts in the present case of supply of software to Reliance are that
the software was supplied separately and not alongwith the equipments,
eventhough the software was stated to be specific for certain equipments
supplied by LTGL. The fact that there is separate agreement for supply of
software not only with Lucent, USA but also from various other non-resident
companies, for use in the Reliance Network by virtue of separate agreements do
indicate that software is not supplied alongwith hardware. As seen from the
copies of agreements placed on record, some agreements are only for purchase
of license/ granting of license only. But majority of agreements are standard
in their format, which was discussed by Ld CIT(A) in the case of agreement
with Lucent. It was admitted that the software works on the hardware, but the
supply was not integral part of purchase of equipment required/ nor embedded
software. Therefore, the facts as stated before the Special Bench of ITAT and
Hon'ble Delhi High Court are entirely different when compared to the facts
before us almost in all the cases, where the software agreements are stand-
alone agreements, not with purchase of equipment and not supplied along with
equipment as embedded software. The delivery was separate, as stated in the
form of CD's, mostly abroad and was installed in India separately. As already
stated, the Lucent has not been supplying software as part of equipment
purchased but as a stand-alone software agreement entered into as the 'end
user license agreement'.
64 Reliance and Lucent Group
30\. The issue of supply of software and granting of End user license
agreement (EULA) was considered by the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in the
case of CIT vs. Synopsis International Ltd. 212 Taxman 454 (Kar).

(iii) Under the DTAA with the U. S. A., the necessary ingredient to be
satisfied to find out whether the payment would amount to "royalty" is that it
is received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any
copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work. A literary work is
entitled to copyright. In India, section 2(o) of the Copyright Act, 1957,
defines "literary work" as including computer programmes, tables and
compilations including computer database. Therefore, "computer software" has
been recognised as copyright work in India also. The Legislature has treated
literary work like books and other articles separately from computer software
within the meaning of the "copyright" under the Copyright Act. There is a
difference between a purchase of a book or a music CD because while these can
be used once they are purchased, software stored in a dumb CD requires a
license to enable the user to download it upon his hard disk, in the absence
of which there would be an infringement of the owner's copyright. (TCS vs.
State of AP distinguished as being in the context of sales-tax);
allowing the appeals, that in the absence of any definition of "copyright" in
the Act or the DTAA with the respective countries, in view of article 3 of the
DTAA, reference had to be made to the respective law regarding the definition
of "copyright", namely, the Copyright Act, 1957, in India, wherein it is
clearly stated that "literary work" includes computer programmes, tables and
compilations including computer databases. It was not disputed that payments
had been made by the assessee to non- residents for having imported shrink
wrapped software/off-the-shelf software. It was clear from the material on
record that what was transferred was the right to use the software, an
exclusive right, which the owner of the copyright, i.e., the foreign supplier
owned and what was transferred was only the right to use copy of the software
for the internal business as per the terms and conditions of the agreement.
The right that was transferred was the transfer of copyright including the
right to make copy of software for internal business, and payment made in that
regard would constitute royalty for imparting of any information concerning
technical, industrial, commercial or scientific knowledge, experience or
skill. The payment for the right would 67 Reliance and Lucent Group constitute
"royalty" within the meaning of article 12(3) of the DTAA and the provisions
of 9(1)(vi) of the Act. Tax had to be deducted at source on the payment.
32\. The Honble High Court of Karnataka considered and analysed the provisions
of Income Tax, particularly section 9, in detail in the case of
Synopsis(supra) from Para 19 to 27. The detailed discussion on the issue is as
under:
> 19\. From the aforesaid judgments it is clear, a distinction has been made
> between a transfer of a right in a copyright and transfer of a right in a
> copyrighted article. In view of the language employed in sub-clause (v) to
> Explanation 2, the question is not whether what is transferred is a right in
> a copyright or a copyrighted article. The real question is whether the
> consideration paid to the owner or a licensor of a copyright, for permission
> to use the software/computer programme is a consideration for transfer of
> any right in respect of a copyright and falls within the mischief of the
> definition of 'Royalty'. This is clear from the wordings in section 9 of the
> Act, which reads as under :-
> "(1) The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India:-
> (vi) income by way of royalty payable by-
> ..................................
> (b) a person who is a resident, except where the royalty is payable in
> respect of any right, property or information used or services utilised for
> the purposes of a business or profession carried, on by such person outside
> India or for the purposes of making or earning any income from any source
> outside India;
> ..................................
> [Provided further that nothing contained in this clause shall apply in
> relation to so much of the income by way of royalty as consists of lump sum
> payment made by a person, who is a resident, for the transfer of all or any

> supplied by a non-resident manufacturer along with a computer or computer-
> based equipment under any scheme approved under the Policy on Computer
> Software Export, Software Development and Training, 1986 of the Government
> of India] Explanation 2 - For the purposes of this clause, "royalty" means
> consideration (including any lump sum consideration but excluding any
> consideration which would be the income of the recipient chargeable under
> the head "Capital gains") for-
(v) the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a licence) in
respect of any copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work including
films or video tapes for use in connection with television or tapes for use in
connection with radio 68 Reliance and Lucent Group broadcasting, but not
including consideration for the sale, distribution of exhibition of
cinematographic films; or
(vi) the rendering of any services in connection with the activities referred
to in sub-
> clause (i) to (iv), (iva) and (v) [Explanation 3. For the purposes of this
> clause, 'computer software' means any computer programme recorded on any
> disc, tape, perforated media or other information storage device and
> includes any such programme or any customized electronic data]
> ..................................
> [Explanation - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that for the
> purposes of this section, income of a non-resident shall be deemed to accrue
> or arise in India under clause (v) or clause (vi) or clause (vii) of sub-
> section (1) and shall be included in the total income of the non-resident,
> whether or not,-
> (i) the non-resident has a residence or place of business or business
> connection in India: or
> (ii) the non-resident has rendered services in India."
> 20\. Income by way of 'Royalty' is liable to tax. The second proviso to
> Clause (vi) makes it clear that any lump sum payment made by a resident for
> the transfer of all or any lights including granting of a licence in respect
> of computer software supplied by a non-resident manufacturer along with a
> computer of computer based equipment under any scheme approved under the
> Policy on Computer Software Export, Software Developments and Training, 1986
> of the Govt., of India, would not constitute 'Royalty'. For the purpose of
> the said section, the computer software supplied by a non-resident to a

> clear that the consideration paid for supply of a software by a non-resident
> to a resident is a software (sic. royalty) unless it falls within the
> section proviso.
> 21\. Therefore, any computer software sold on the shelf falls under the;
> second proviso and the consideration paid thereon falls within the mischief
> of 'Royalty' as defined in the said proviso. It is in this background, we
> have to look into clause (v) of Explanation 2. Under Explanation 2, for the
> purpose of clause (v), 'Royalty' means consideration (including any lump sum
> consideration but excluding any consideration which would be the income of
> the recipient chargeable under the head "Capital gains"). In other words,
> one of the tests to be applied is whether the consideration :
paid would fall within the definition of capital gains. If the consideration
paid do not fall within the definition of capital gains and do not fall within
the second proviso, 69 Reliance and Lucent Group then the said consideration
would be 'Royalty' for the purpose of this clause, as defined in Explanation
2.
22\. Similarly, clause (v) deals with copyright, literary, artistic or
scientific work and the consideration for the transaction of all or any rights
(including granting of licence) in respect of any copyright, literary,
artistic or scientific work as 'Royalty'. Similarly, what is excluded from the
definition of Royalty' are consideration for the sale, distribution or
exhibition of cinematographic films. Whereas, it expressly states the
rendering of any services in connection with the activities referred to in
sub- clauses (i) to (iv) (iva) and (v) also constitutes 'Royalty'. For the
purpose of this provision, any rights includes granting of a licence, it
should be in respect of any copyright. It is not a right in copyright.
Therefore, the words "in respect of assumes importance for the proper
understanding of what the legislature meant in defining 'Royalty' as they have
done in Explanation 2. The argument is that it is only the consideration paid
for transfer of a right in the copyright, which would constitute 'Royalty' and
any consideration paid for the transfer of a copyrighted article do not
involve any transfer or right and therefore, it is outside the scope of
'Royalty' as appeared in Explanation 2. The said argument is based on the
aforesaid two decisions referred to supra. In the entire discussions in the
aforesaid two cases, the words used in Clause 5 namely, "in respect or, is not
noticed and not discussed. It is well settled law that the legislature is
deemed not to waste its words or to say anything in vain. A construction which
attributes redundancy to the legislature is not acceptable except for
compelling reasons. The Courts always presume that the legislature inserted
every word thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention in that every
word of the statute should have effect. The intention of the legislature is
primarily to be gathered from the words used. The words of a statute are first
understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and phrases and
sentences are construed according to their grammatical meaning, unless that
leads to some absurdity or unless is something in the context, or in the
object of the statute to suggest the contrary. The right way is to take the
words as the legislature has given them, and to take the meaning which the
words given naturally imply, unless where the construction of those words is.
either by the preamble or by the context of the words in question controlled
or altered. In this context it is necessary to know the meaning of the words
"in respect of used in the 70 Reliance and Lucent Group aforesaid provision.
In fact this phrase has been the subject matter of interpretation by the Apex
Court as well as the High Court.
23\. The Apex Court in the case of Shahdara (Delhi) Saharanpur Light Railway
Co. Ltd. v. Upper Doab Sugar Mills Ltd. and anotehr, reported in AIR 1960 Page
695, held as under:-
"We do not propose, however, to rest our decision on this narrow question of
haulage from the station platform to point A, as in our view the assumption
made above as regards the definition of terminals in S. 3(14) is not
justified. The definition as has already been stated is in these words.
"Terminals" includes "'charges in respect of stations, sidings, wharves,
depots, warehouses, cranes and other similar matters, and of any service
rendered thereat". Thus two classes of charges are included in the definition.
The first is "charges in respect of stations, sidings, wharves, depots,
warehouses, cranes and other similar matters." The second is "charges in
respect of any services rendered thereat". Whether or not therefore any
services have been rendered "threat" that is, at the stations sidings,
wharves, depots, warehouses, cranes and other similar matters the other class
of terminals in respect of these stations, sidings, wharves, depots,
warehouses, cranes and similar other matters remain. A further question thus
arises as regards the interpretation of the phrase "in respect of". Does it
mean charges for the mere provision and maintenance of stations, sidings,
depots, wharves, warehouses, cranes and other similar matters are the
terminals or does it contemplate charges only for use of sidings, stations,
wharves depots, warehouses, cranes and other similar matters? The words "in
respect of" are wide enough to permit charges being made as terminals so long
as any of these things, viz., stations, sidings, wharves, depots warehouses,
cranes and other similar matters have been provided and are being maintained.
The question is whether the import of this generality of language should be
cut down for any reason. It is well settled that a limited interpretation has
to be made on words used by the legislature in spite of the generality of the
languages used where the literal interpretation in the general sense would be
so unreasonable or absurd that the legislature should be presumed not to have
intended the same. Is there any such reason for cutting down the result of the
generality of the language used present here? The answer in our opinion must
be in the negative. It is true that in many cases stations, sidings, wharves,
depots warehouses, cranes and other similar things will be used and it is
arguable that in using the words "in respect of" the legislature had such user
in mind. It is well to notice however that the legislature must have been
equally aware that whereas in some cases accommodation provided by stations
will he used, in, some cases sidings will be used, in other wharves, in others
warehouses and in other cases cranes, and in certain cases several of these
may be used, in most cases there will be no use of all of these. From the
practical point of view it is impossible to regulate terminate charges
separately in respect of user of each of these several things mentioned. When
therefore the legislature authorised the Central Government to fix terminals
as defined in S. 3(14), the intention must have been that the terminals
leviable would not depend on how many of these things would be used. It is
also worth noticing that the user of a depot, warehouse and cranes would
necessarily mean some service rendered "threat". If terminals did not include
charges in respect of the provisions of depots, warehouses, cranes unless 71
Reliance and Lucent Group these were used, there would be no need of including
these in the first portion as they would be covered by the second part of the
definition viz., "of any services rendered threat". For from being there any
reason to cut down, the consequence of the generality of language used viz.,
"in respect of, there is thus good ground for thinking that the legislature
used this language deliberately to cut across the difficulty of distinguishing
in a particular case as to which of these things had been used or whether any
of them had been used at all. Innumerable people corry goods over the Railways
and many of them for the purpose of the carriage make use of the stations,
sidings, wharves, depots, warehouses, cranes and other similar matters, while
many do not. Though at first sight it might seem unreasonable that those who
had not used would have to pay the same charge as those who had made use of
these, it is obvious " that the interminable disputes that would arise between
the Railway Administration and the Railway users, if the fact of user of
stations, sidings and other things mentioned had to determine the amount
payable, would be unhelpful not only to the Railway Administration but also to
the using public. The sensible, way was therefore to make a charge leviable
for the mere provision of these things irrespective of whether any use was
made thereof. That was the reason way such wide words "in respect of was used.
We are therefore of opinion that the words "in respect of" used in section
3(14) mean for the provision of and not "for the user of."
24\. The High Court of Bombay in the case of Anusya Vithal v. J.H. Mehta,
Addl. Authority Under Payment of Wages Act, bombay and another, reported in
AIR 1960 (Bombay) 201 held as under :
"4. Another requirement of a payment to fall within the term "wages" is that
it must be "in "respect of employment or work done in such employment." The
expression "in respect of" means "attributable to" [see Asher v. Seoford Court
Estates Ltd. [1950 A.C. 508, 526] or, if it is given a wider meaning,
"relating to or with reference to" [see Tolaram Relumal v. State of Bombay
(1955) 1 SCR 158 at P. 165: (AIR 1954 466 at p.499). The payment must,
therefore, be attributable to employment, that is, engagement in work, or to
work done. During the period of lay-off, the employer is not in a position to
provide work and the employee cannot insist on work being provided or wages
being paid to him. The employee is also not wider any duty to work for his
master or even to present himself for work. He has to present himself for work
if he desires to claim compensation (see S. 25E of the Industrial Disputes
Act). But he has an option in the matter. If he remains absent, he will not be
entitled to compensation, but he will not lose the right, which he possesses
under the standing orders, of reinstatement when the normal working is
resumed. The employer cannot insist, on his attendance and there is also no
obligation upon 1dm to provide work or to pay wages even if the worker
presents himself for work. In order to escape liability for compensation, the
employer may provide the worker with alternative employment, but the worker is
not bound to accept it. If he does not accept it, he will not be entitled to
claim lay-off compensation, but he will not lose his right of reinstatement
when the lay-off ends. The compensation for lay-off is, therefore, paid in
respect of a period when no work is done and when in fact there is no
liability on the employer to provide work and on the employee to do work. It
is not paid as additional remuneration for work done previously. It cannot,
therefore, be said to be attributable to the employment of a worker or to the
work done by him. It is made payable in order to mitigate or 72 Reliance and
Lucent Group reduce the hardship caused by reason of unemployment or temporary
loss of employment. Consequently, it cannot be said to be a payment "in
respect of employment or work done in such employment."
25\. The High Court Patna in the case of Commissioner of income tax vs.
Chunnilal Rameshwar Lal, reported in AIR 1968 Patna page 364 held as under :
"It is well known that the expression "in respect of is of wider connotation
than the word "in" or "on". Hence, a class of municipal tax, though not a tax
on the premises or buildings, may nevertheless be a tax in respect of the
premises or building used for the business. Hence, the payment of the impugned
amount of Rs. 125 as professional tax under section 150A read with (section
82(1)(ff) of the Municipal Act is in substance a municipal tax in respect of
the business premises, and is covered by clause (ix) of sub-section (2) of
section 10 of the Income-tax Act. The assessee is entitled to get allowance
for the same under section 10(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The
Appellate Tribunal was right in giving allowance to the assessee for a sum of
Rs. 125 paid by him under the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act, 1922."
26\. The Apex Court in the case of Union of India v. Vijay Chand Jain,
reported in AIR 1977 SC page 1302 held as under:-
"4. The contravention alleged is of section 4(1) which prohibits, inter alia,
sale of any foreign exchange. Foreign exchange as defined in section 2(d)
means foreign currency. Under section 23(1B) any currency, security, gold or
silver, or goods or any other money or property "in respect of which" the
contravention has taken place is liable to be confiscated to the Central
Government. The currency confiscated this case was Indian currency. The
question is whether the Indian currency constituting the sale proceeds of
foreign exchange seized from the respondent was currency in respect of which
the contravention had taken place. The words "in respect of" admit of a wide
connotation; Lord Greene M.R. in Cunard's Trustees v. Inland Revenue
Commissioners (1946) 174 LT 133 calls them colourless words. This Court in
S.S. Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. Upper Doab Sugar Mills Ltd. (1960) 2 SCR
926=(AIR 1960 SC 695) construing these words in section 3(14) of the Indian
Railways Act, 1890 has held that they are very wide. It seems to us that in
the context of section 23(1B) "in respect of" has been used in the sense of
being 'connected with' and we have no difficulty in holding that the currency
in respect of which there has been contravention covers the sale proceeds of
foreign currency, sale of which is prohibited under section 4(1). The
intention of the legislature is clear from the explanation to sub-section (1B)
of section 23 which provides that "for the purposes of the sub- section
properly in respect of which contravention has taken place shall include
deposits in a bank where such property is converted into such deposits." If
for this sub-section any property in respect of which a contravention has
taken place includes deposits into which the property may be converted and can
be reached even where the deposits are in a bank, it is not reasonable to
think that the sale proceeds in Indian currency of any foreign exchange would
be outside the scope of section 23(1B) and therefore not liable to be
confiscated. In our opinion the High Court was wrong in quashing the order of
confiscation which we consider valid and lawful"
73 Reliance and Lucent Group
27\. The words "in respect of" denotes the intention of the Parliament to give
a broader meaning. The words 'in respect of admit of a wide connotation, than
the word "in" or "on". The expression "in respect of" "means attributable to"
If it is given a wider meaning "relating to or with reference to", it has been
used in the sense of being 'connected with'. Whether it is a fiscal
legislation or any legislation for that matter, the golden rule of
interpretation equally applies to all of them. i.e., the words in a statute
should be given its literal meaning. In respect of fiscal legislation those
words should be strictly construed. If those words are capable of two meanings
that meaning which is beneficial to an assessee should be given. However, when
the meaning of the words used are clear, unambiguous, merely because it is a
fiscal legislation, the meaning cannot be narrowed down and it cannot be
interpreted so as to give benefit to the assessee only. Then it would be re-
writing the section, under the guise of interpreting a fiscal legislation,
which is totally impermissible in law. When the legislature has advisedly used
the words 'in respect of', the intention is clear and manifest. The said
phrase being capable of a broader meaning, the same is used in the section to
bring within the tax net all the incomes from the transfer of all or any of
the rights in respect of a copyright. In a taxing statute provisions enacted
to prevent tax evasion are to be given a liberal construction to effectuate
the purpose of suppressing tax evasion, although provisions imposing a charge
are construed strictly there being no apriori liability to pay a tax and the
purpose of charging section being only to levy a charge on persons and
activities brought within its clear terms. Therefore, the specific words used
in a taxing statute, charging tax cannot be ignored. It is not the
consideration for transfer of all or any of the rights in the copyright.
Without transferring a right in the copyright it is possible to receive
consideration for the use of the intellectual property for which the owner
possess a copyright. Ultimately, the consideration paid is for the usefulness
of the material object in respect of which there exists a copyright.
Therefore, the intention was not to exclude the consideration paid for the use
of such material object which is popularly called as copyrighted article. Even
in respect of a copyrighted article the same is transferred, no doubt the
right in the copyright is not transferred, but a right in respect of a
copyright contained in the copyrighted article is transferred. Therefore, the
Parliament thought it fit to use the phrase 'in respect of' as contra distinct
from the word 'in' copyright. The meaning is clear, intention is clear, there
is no ambiguity. Therefore, there is no scope for 74 Reliance and Lucent Group
interpretation of this expressed term inasmuch as in the context in which it
is used in the provision. Any other interpretation would lead to the aforesaid
provision becoming otiose.
33\. Interpreting the Sections of Copyright Act, the issue was further
analysed as under in Paras 29 to 36.
29\. The copyright Act, also do not define the word copyright in the
definition section 2. However, Section 14, gives the meaning of "copyright".
This section was substituted for the previous one by the Copyright (Amendment)
Act of 1994. Section 14 insofar as it is relevant is extracted hereunder:
"14. For the purposes of this Act "copyright" means the exclusive right
subject to the provisions of this Act, to do or authorize the doing of any of
the following acts in respect of a work or any substantial part thereof
namely:
(a) in the case of literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a computer
programme -
(i) to reproduce the work in any material form including the storing of it in
any medium by electronics means,
(ii) to issue copies of the work to the public not being copies already in
circulation;
(iii) to perform the work in public, or communicate it to the public.
(iv) to make any cinematograph film or sound recording in respect of work;
          (v)     to make any translation of the work;'
          (vi)    to make any adaptation of the work;
(vii) to do, in relation to a translation or an adaptation of the work, any of
the acts specified in relation to the work in sub-clause (i) to (vi)."
30\. The object of a definition is to avoid the necessity of frequent
repetitions in describing all the subject-matter to which the word or
expression so defined is intended to apply. The Legislature has power to
define a word even artificially. So the definition of a word in the definition
section may either be restrictive of its ordinary meaning or it may be
extensive of the same. When a word is defined to 'mean' such and such, the
definition is prima facie restrictive and exhaustive whereas the word defined
is declared to 'include' such and such, the definition is prima facie
extensive. Although it is normally presumed that the Legislature will be
specially precise and careful in its choice of language in a definition
section, at times the language used in such a section itself requires
interpretation. A definition is not to be read in isolation. It must be read
in the context of the phrase which it defines, realising that the function of
a definition is 75 Reliance and Lucent Group to give precision and certainty
to a word or phrase which would otherwise be vague and uncertain but not to
contradict it or supplant it altogether. An interpretation clause is not meant
to prevent the word receiving its ordinary, popular and natural sense whenever
that would be properly applicable but to enable the word as used in the Act
when there is nothing in the context or the subject matter to the contrary to
be applied to some things to which it would not ordinarily be applicable. Even
when the definition clause uses words of very wide connotation a line may have
to be drawn so as to exclude categories obviously not intended to be included.
31\. When a word has been defined in the interpretation clause, prima facie
that definition governs whenever that word is used in the body of the statute.
If Parliament in a statutory enactment defines its terms whether by enlarging
or by restricting the ordinary meaning of a word or expression, it must
intended that, in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, those
terms as defined shall govern what is proposed, authorised or done under or by
reference to that enactment. But, where the context makes the definition given
in the interpretation clause inapplicable, a defined word when used in the
body of the statute may have to be given a meaning different from that
contained in the interpretation clause. All definitions given in an
interpretation clause are therefore normally enacted subject to the
qualification "unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,
or unless the context otherwise requires". Even in the absence of an express
qualification to that effect such a qualifications is always implied. However,
it is incumbent on those who contend that the definition given in the
interpretation clause does not apply to a particular section to show that the
context in fact so requires.
32\. In this background it is pertinent to note the opening words of section
14. It expressly state that "for the purposes of this Act". The intention of
the parliament in expressing the meaning of the word in that manner and not
defining the said term in the definition section cannot be lost sight of.
Further, the legislature has chosen to employ the word 'means' in defining the
meaning of the word 'copyright' which again makes the intention very clear
that the said meaning to the word "copyright" is restrictive and exhaustive.
Then the further words, 'exclusive right subject to the provisions of this
Act' further imposes a rider on the meaning of the word 'copyright'. Though
the word used is "exclusive right", in section 30 of the Act, the Parliament
has provided what are the rights which the owners of a copyright may part
with. It expressly states the owner of 76 Reliance and Lucent Group the
copyright in any existing work may grant any interest in the right by licence
in writing signed by him or by his duly authorised agent. Therefore, when if
comes to the question of granting licence it need not necessarily be the
exclusive right, a may be any interest in the right. Therefore, when the word
'copyright' has not been defined in the definition section of the Act and the
meaning of the word 'copyright' is to be found in section 14 of the Act. it is
only for the purposes of the Act. Even though under section 14 copyright means
the exclusive right, that is also subject to the provisions of the Act. The
intention of the legislature is unambiguous, clear. The meaning of the word
'copyright' cannot be read in isolation. It most be understood in the context
of the aforesaid restrictions, limitations imposed by the Parliament by
express words. Therefore, if would not be proper to assign the same meaning as
found in section 14 to the word 'copyright' when it is used in another
enactment. The interpretation clause is not meant to prevent the word
receiving its ordinary, popular and natural sense whenever that would be
properly applicable, but to enable the word as used in the Act, when there is
nothing in the context or the subject matter to the contrary to be applied to
some things to which it would not ordinarily be applicable. Therefore, while
understanding the meaning of the word 'royalty' used in the Income-tax Act as
defined in Explanation (2) to section 9(1) of the Income-tax Act the meaning
assigned to the word 'copyright' cannot be literally superimposed in that
provision. It has to be understood in the context in which it is used as well
as it has to be understood in the ordinary, popular and natural sense in which
it is understood. Moreover the Copyright Act is concerned with protection of
an intellectual property right which is vested in the owner of the copyright
and prevention of its infringement. That is why while defining the meaning of
the word 'copyright' it is defined as meaning 'exclusive right' to reproduce
the work in any material form including the storing of it in any medium by
electronic means or to issue copies of the work to the public pot being copies
already in circulation or to sell or give on commercial rental or other than
for sale or for commercial rental any copy of the computer programme. The
reproduction which is sought to be prohibited by the Act but for which the
owner of the copyright could be put to an enormous loss. The said definition
does not deal with the ordinary meaning of the word 'copyright' which includes
the right to use the work. It is a negative right. If is not a right to do
something but rather a right to restrict others from doing certain acts. It is
in this context the word 'exclusive' has to be understood. When in the Act
itself after using the word exclusive right in section 14, when it comes to
the question of licence of 77 Reliance and Lucent Group a copyright, if need
not necessarily be an exclusive right, but any interest in the right, the word
exclusive has to be restricted firstly to the Act itself and secondly to
situations which fall outside the scope of section 30 of the Act. Therefore,
the expression 'copyright' used in the Act cannot be the same as used in the
Income-tax Act. In the Income-tax Act, when the legislature advisedly used the
word 'in respect of a copyright' it cannot be construed as a right in the
copyright and assign the meaning assigned in the Copyright Act to the second
explanation, line language in Explanation (2) explicitly makes it clear for
the purpose of clause (vi) of sub-section (1) of section 9 royalty means
consideration for transfer of all or any rights including the granting of a
licence in respect of any copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work.
Therefore, the word exclusive right used in section 14 of the Act do not fit
into the meaning of the word 'royalty' in Explanation 2 because royalty means
the consideration for the transfer of all or any rights including the granting
of a licence which is certainly not an exclusive right or transfer of all
rights in the copyright or literary work. Payments made for the acquisition of
partial rights in the copyright without the transfer fully alienating the
copyright rights will represent a royalty where the consideration is for
granting of lights to use the programe in a manner that would, without such
license, constitute an infringement of copyright. In these circumstances, the
payments are for the right to use the copyright in the program i.e., to
exploit the rights that would otherwise be the sole prerogative of the
copyright holder. Therefore, to constitute royalty under the Income- tax Act
it is not necessary that there should be transfer of exclusive right in
copyright, it is sufficient if there is transfer of any interest, in the
right, and also a licence and consideration paid for grant of a licence
constitutes royalty for the purpose of the said clause in the Income-tax Act.
It is in this background, the discussion whether the payment is for a
copyright or for a copyright article would be totally irrelevant. He crux of
the issue is whether any consideration is paid for any right, or for granting
of licence in respect of a copyright. The word 'in respect of gives a broader
meaning. It has been used in the sense of being connected with. When the
legislature has advisedly used the words 'in respect of'. The intention is
clear and manifest. The said phrase being capable of a broader meaning, the
same is used in the section to bring within the tax net all the incomes from
the transfer of all or any of the rights in respect of the copyright.
33\. In the IT Act, computer software is defined in Expln. 3 to s. 9(1)(vi) to
mean any computer programme recorded on any disk, tape, perforated media or
other information 78 Reliance and Lucent Group storage devices and includes
any such programme or any customized electronic data. Though this definition
holds good for the purposes of second proviso to s. 9(1)(vi), the ordinary
meaning and understanding of computer software is no different. Computer
programme as such is not defined under the I.T. Act. However, Computer
programme is defined in the Copyright Act as follows:
"Computer programme means a set of instructions expressed in words, codes,
schemes or in any other form including a machine readable medium, capable of
causing a computer to perform a particular task or achieve a particular
result."
34\. It is also worth mentioning that some routines may be written in assembly
code, essentially a set of memories for object code which another program
translates directly into that code. This is normally done when the programmer
needs to drive the hardware directly, or where speed is required, as it gives
very precise control over the program's operation. Once all sections are
complete, they are fitted together to produce a complete version in source
code, i.e., in human- readable form that gives the user as little information
as possible about the details of the program (thus reducing the danger of
copying), the source code is used as input for another program, the compiler.
This compiles the program into object code, a machine-readable form which will
have linked to it the standard pieces of code for the program to run as a
stand-alone or executable file. This version will be run to test it, and any
errors which are discovered will be fixed in the source code and the whole
recompiled. The final process is to produce the documentation which the user
will need to operate the program. The completed product is the package of
object code version and documentation. A complex piece of software may well
consist of a number of programs which are called by a master program as
different functions are required. Some writers distinguish between programs
(the specific executable code modules) and software (the complete set of
programs plus documentation), 'Software' is thus used interchangeably for both
of these unless the context otherwise makes clear.
35\. The copyright subsists in a computer program. It is not only unauthorised
reproduction but also the storage of a program in a computer constitutes
copyright infringement. Copying a literary work (such as a computer program)
includes storing the work in any medium by electronic means. Copying includes
the making of copies which are transient or some other use of the work. Since
in virtually every case the operation of a program in a computer involves the
copying of the program within the computer, this will constitute reproduction.
Whenever an object program is run on a 79 Reliance and Lucent Group computer,
it is thereby copied; and whenever a source program is compiled in a computer,
it is thereby copied or adapted. A software licence can, therefore, be
legitimately considered to be a copyright licence. A major difficulty arising
out of the licence clause for users is that it will almost invariably restrict
the licensee from transferring the software to any third party. This may
result in difficulties if, for example, the licensee wishes to transfer his
computer operations to a facilities management company the transfer will
require the consent of the licensor and will provide an opportunity for the
charging of an additional fee. Licences have up to how normally prohibited any
copying of the program, except as necessary for use. This had the consequence
that the user could not make backup copies of the program for security
purposes, although some licenses specifically conferred a limited right to
make backup copies.
36\. Ultimately, what the end-user, who pays the consideration requires is,
the benefit of the user of the intellectual property, whether for his personal
use or for commercial use. Merely because the end-user is not permitted to
make commercial use of a copyrighted article by means of re-production of
copyrighted article, it would not take the case out of the provision. The user
may be for personal use or for commercial use. The essence of the copyright is
the usefulness of intellectual property embedded in such copyright. One of the
ways of exploiting a copyright is by re-production for commercial use. But
that is not the only use to which a copyright could be made use of. It could
be used for their personal use and that is the reason why consideration is
stipulated even for such personal use. Though the rights that are transferred
in such a transaction may be limited as compared to transfer of a copyright
for commercial use. In particular, a software or a computer programme is such
a sophisticated goods that it may be sold of the shelf, it may be sold looking
into the needs of the customer, it may be even prepared keeping the
requirement of end-user in mind. In all these cases copyright as such is not
transferred. It is not necessary for the end-user also. The end-user wants
permission to have the benefit of such intellectual property in carrying on
his business which is a commercial venture. It facilitates his business. It is
for that he pays consideration. Without such transfer or permission, the end-
user cannot use the said intellectual property. If he does it amounts to
infringement. Therefore, the right to use the intellectual property in respect
of which the owner or the licensor possess a copyright is also a right in
respect of a copyright, though not in the copyright itself. Therefore, the 80
Reliance and Lucent Group words used in the provision that transfer of all or
any of the rights includes the right to grant license in respect of copyright
includes such right to use the intellectual property in respect of which the
owner or the licensor possess copyright. It falls within the mischief of the
word 'royalty' as defined under section 9(1) (vi) of the Act.
34\. Further the issue of granting License was analysed in Para 41 to 46 of
the same judgement as under:
> What is a license?
> 40\. A licence is a grant of authority to do a particular thing. It enables
> a person to do lawfully what he could not otherwise lawfully do. A licence
> does not, in law, confer a right. It only prevents that from being unlawful
> which, but for the licence, would be unlawful. It amounts to a consent or
> permission by an owner of copyright that another person should do an act
> which, but for that licence, would involve an infringement of the copyright
> of licensor. A licence gives no more than the right to do the thing actually
> licensed to be done. It transfers an interest to a limited extent, whereby
> the licensee acquires an equitable right only in the copyrighted article.
> 41\. Licences may be exclusive, or non-exclusive. Non-exclusive licence is
> not defined in the Act. The term 'exclusive licence' is defined in section
> 2, clause (j). It confers on the licensee and persons authorised by him, to
> the exclusion of all, other persons, including the owner of the copyright,
> any right comprised in the copyright in a work. A non-exclusive licence is
> the grant of authority to do a particular thing with no right of exclusion
> whatsoever. It never conveys, by itself, an interest in property. It merely
> enables a person to do that which he could not otherwise do, except
> unlawfully.
42\. The owner of the copyright in any existing work may grant any interest in
the right by licence in writing signed by him or by his duly authorised agent.
Copyright is different from the material object which is the subject of the
copyright. So, a transfer of the material object does not necessarily involve
a transfer of the copyright. The copyright in a book, picture or other work is
disconnected and distinct from the general property in the material book,
picture or other object. Hence, the sale or other transfer of the material
object does not, of itself, constitute a transfer of the copyright therein. An
assignment carries with it the whole interest in the thing assigned, including
the right of reassign, while a licence is personal and not assignable without
81 Reliance and Lucent Group the grantor's consent. An exclusive licence is a
leave to do a thing, and a contract not to give leave to anybody else to do
the same thing, It confers no interest, or property in the thing but only
makes an action lawful, which, without it, would have been unlawful.
43\. A licence is a permission to do something that would otherwise be
unlawful. The question arises, therefore, as to what legal permission is
granted by a software licence. The answer is, briefly, that in some cases the
licence will be a permission to use confidential information, and in virtually
in all cases it will be a permission to copy a copyright work. If the software
has been kept secret by the producer, or only supplied on conditions of
confidentiality and has not been published too widely, then the software
licence will be akin to a licence of confidential information or know-how. The
owner or licensor of a copyright, has a right to grant permission to use the
software or a computer programme, in respect of which they have a copyright,
without transferring the right in copyright. It is one of the right of a
copyright. owner or licensor. Without such right being transferred, the end-
user has no right to use the software or computer programme. If he uses it, it
amounts to infringement of copyright. For transfer of such right if
consideration is paid, it is not a consideration for transfer of a copyright
but for use of intellectual property embedded in the copyright, and therefore
it is for transfer of one of those rights of the owner of the copyright. It is
not a right in copyright but it is in respect of a copyright. When a
copyrighted article is sold also, the end-user gets the right to use the
intellectual property embedded in the copyright and not a right in the
copyright as such. Therefore the mode adopted or the terminology given is not
decisive to decide the nature of transfer. Ultimately, it is the substance
which has to be looked into.
44\. Therefore, it is necessary to look into the terms of the agreement
entered into between the parties, as it would be purely question of fact to be
decided on the basis of the intention of the parties as could be gathered from
the written words used in the agreement. The relevant terms in the agreement

secret or other proprietary light of a third party, and Synopsys will
indemnify and hold Licensee harmless from and against any damages, costs and
fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are
attributable to such claim or action and which are assessed against Licensee
in a final judgment. Licensee agrees that Synopsys shall be release from the
foregoing obligation unless licensee provides Synopsys with:
> (i) prompt written notification of the claim or action;

power to direct or control the day-to-day activities of the other or (ii) to
constitute the parties as partners, joint ventures, co-owners or otherwise as
participants in a joint a common undertaking. 13.9. Injunctive relief. The
parties agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely entitled
affecting Synopsys' Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Product,
Design Techniques or Documentation would cause irreparable injury to Synopsys
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Synopsys shall
be to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at
law."
45\. As is clear from the description of the agreement it is an end-user
software licence agreement. Clause 2.1 deals with grant of rights. It
provides, Software License Synopsys hereby grants licencee a non-exclusive,
non-transferable license, without right of sub-licence of use the licensed
software and design techniques only in the quantity authorized by a licensee
in accordance with the documentation in the use area. Licensee may make a
reasonable number of copies of the licensed software for backup and/or
archival purposes only. Merely because the words non-exclusive and non-
transferable is used in the said licence it does not take away the software
out of the definition of the copyright. The word licenced software has been
defined. Similarly, the words design, design technique is also defined. The
word documentation is also defined and it is not in dispute what is granted is
a license. Even if it is not transfer of exclusive right in the copyright, the
right to use the confidential information embedded in the software in terms of
the aforesaid licence makes it abundantly clear that there is transfer of
certain rights which the owner of copyright possess in the said computer
software/programme in respect of the copyright owned. In terms of the DTAA the
consideration paid for the use or right to use the said confidential
information in the form of computer programme software itself constitutes
royalty and attracts tax. It is not necessary that there should be a transfer
of exclusive right in the copyright as contended by the assessee. The
consideration paid is for rights in respect of the copyright and for the user
of the confidential information embedded in the software/computer programme.
Therefore, 88 Reliance and Lucent Group it falls within the mischief of
Explanation (2) of clause (vi) of sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Act and
there is a liability to pay the tax.
46\. If there was any doubt regarding the taxability of this income the
parliament by Finance Act, 2010 has substituted the explanation to section 9
which gives a clear intention of the legislature insofar as the liability of
tax under this provision is concerned. A perusal of the said explanation makes
it clear that as there was a doubt earlier, they want to remove the doubts by
introducing this explanation. By the explanation they have declared that for
the purpose of section 9 which deals with income deemed to accrue or arise in
India, under clauses (v), (vi) and (vii) of sub- section (1), such income
shall be included in the total income of the non- resident, whether or not (i)
the non-resident has a residence or place of business or business connection
in India, (ii) the non-resident has rendered services in India. Therefore, the
object is to levy tax on the income of a non-resident, if it has accrued or
arisen in India and one such income is the income from royalty
35\. Expressing similar view, the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has held
similarly in the case of Samsung( supra) as under: (para 20) Having regard to
the above said definition of "royalty", we have to con-sider the contents of
software licence agreement entered into by the non-resident with Samsung
Electronics and also the respondents in the case represented by Sri Ganesh,
learned senior counsel and Sri Aravind Dattar, wherein it is a case of
purchase, sale or distribution or otherwise of the off-the-shelf software. It
is described as a "software licence agreement", wherein it is averred that
customer accepts an individual, non- transferable and non-exclusive licence to
use the licensed software program(s) on the terms and conditions enumerated in
the agreement. It is further averred that the customer-Samsung Electronics-
shall protect confidential infor-mation and shall not remove any copyright,
confidentiality or other pro-prietary rights provided by the non- resident.
However, what is granted under the said licence is only a licence to use the
software for internal business without having any right for making any
alteration or reverse engineering or creating sub-licences. What is
transferred under the said licence is the licence to use the software and the
copyright continue to be with the non- resident as per the agreement. Even as
per the agreement entered into with the other distributors as also the end-
user licence agree-ment, it is clear that the distributor would get exclusive
non-transferable licence within the territory for which he is appointed and he
has got right to distribute via resellers the software, upon payment of the
licences set forth in exhibit A to the agreement only to end users pursuant to
a valid Actuate shrinkwrap or other actuate licence agreement and except as
expressly set forth in the said agreement, distributor may not rent, lease,
loan, sell or otherwise distribute the software the documentation or any
derivative works based upon the software or documentation in whole or in part.
Distributor shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to
derive or modify the source code for the software. The distri-butor shall have
no rights to the software other than the rights expressly set 89 Reliance and
Lucent Group forth in the agreement. The distributor shall not modify or copy
any part of the software or documentation. The distributor may not use sub-
distributors for further distribution of the software and documentation
without the prior consent of Actuate. What is charged is the licence fee to be
paid by the distributor of the software as enumerated in exhibit A to the
agreement. Further, clause 6.01 of the agreement dealing with title states
that the distributor acknowledges that actuate and its suppliers retain all
right, title and interest in and to the original, and any copies (by whomever
produced), of the software or documentation and ownership of all patent
copyright, trade mark, trade secret and other intellectual pro-perty rights
pertaining thereto, shall be and remain the sole property of Actuate. The
distributor shall not be an owner of any copies of, or any interest in, the
software, but rather is licenced pursuant to the agreement to use and
distribute such copies. Actuate represents that it has the right to enter into
the agreement and grant the licences provided therein and confidentiality is
protected. Therefore, on reading the contents of the respective agreement
entered into by the respondents with the non-resi-dent, it is clear that under
the agreement, what is transferred is only a licence to use the copyright
belonging to the non-resident subject to the terms and conditions of the
agreement, as referred to above, and the non- resident supplier continues to
be the owner of the copyright and all other intellectual property rights. It
is well settled that copyright is a negative right. It is an umbrella of many
rights and licence is granted for making use of the copyright in respect of
shrink wrapped software/off-the-shelf software under the respective agreement,
which authorizes the end user, i.e., the customer to make use of the copyright
software contained in the said software, which is purchased off the shelf or
imported as shrink wrapped software and the same would amount to transfer of
part of the copyright and transfer of right to use the copyright for internal
business as per the terms and conditions of the agreement. Therefore, the
contention of the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents that
there is no transfer of copyright or any part thereof under the agreements
entered into by the respondent with the non-resident supplier of software
cannot be accepted.
36\. The principles laid down by the two judgements of the Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court are applicable to the present cases as the fact of supply of
software is similar.
37\. In the case of Lucent Technologies (270 ITR(AT) 62(Bang), the ITAT has
held that what the assessee supplied was a copyrighted article which does not
involve any royalty. That order of the ITAT was not upheld by the Hon'ble
Karnataka High Court. Subsequently when the matter was restored by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court in assessee's group case
itself, Lucent technologies 348 ITR 196(Kar) held that supply of software is
to be considered as royalty.
It was held:
> The assessee imported software from the USA for the assessment years
> 1999-2000 to 2002-03. It had also separately imported hardware from Taiwan.
> The Income-tax Officer initiated proceedings 90 Reliance and Lucent Group
> under section 201(1) and 201(1A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, against the
> assessee for failure to deduct tax at source in respect of payment made for
> the software imported from the USA. The case of the assessee was that it had
> obtained orders from the Department of Telecommunications for manufacture
> and supply of telecommunications/switching equipment. In order to execute
> its orders in India it had placed separate orders for software and hardware
> and integrated them and had executed its commitment to the
> Telecommunications Department. The Income-tax Officer and as confirmed by
> the Commissioner (Appeals) proceeded to hold that the software and the
> hardware had been imported by the assessee, through two separate countries
> and integrated in India by the assessee. The execution of the contract by
> the assessee with the Telecommunications Department in India was a separate
> contract from the import of software from the USA. It was held that the
> payments were made for supply of software which was utilised by the assessee
> and, consequently, the provisions of section 9(1)(vi) of the Act read with
> the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and the USA were
> applicable. The Tribunal held that the payment made by the assessee for
> acquiring the software could not be termed royalty payments and, therefore,
> no deduction of tax was necessary and, consequently, section 195 was not
> applicable. On appeal to the High Court :
> Held, allowing the appeals, that the supply of software from the USA to the
> assessee was an independent transaction. The hardware utilised by the
> assessee was received from Taiwan. Only after receipt of both the software
> and the hardware, had they been integrated by the assessee in India and
> thereafter supplied to the Department of Telecommunications as an end
> product in terms of the assessee's independent contract. Therefore, the
> finding recorded by the Tribunal was erroneous. Consequently, the payments
> made by the assessee amounted to royalty and were liable to be taxed in
> India under section 9(1)(vi) read with the Double Taxation Avoidance
> Agreement. Order of the Appellate Tribunal in Lucent Technologies Hindustan
> Ltd. v. ITO [2004] 270 ITR (AT) 62 (Bang) set aside.
38\. In the light of the above principles laid down by the Hon'ble Karnataka
High Court, that too in group case itself on same terms of agreement as that
of with Reliance for supply of software, we are inclined to follow the
judgements of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court over the decision of the
Special Bench of the ITAT in the case of Motorola (supra) which was rendered
in a different fact situation.
91 Reliance and Lucent Group
39\. In the cases before us, the learned counsel for Lucent fairly admitted
that the issue is to be decided in the light of the judgement of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court vis-à-vis the judgement of the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court.
As stated earlier the facts in the case before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court
was for supply of software alongwith hardware as embedded software as a part
of one agreement and its installation for which no separate payment was made,
whereas in this case Reliance purchased the software by virtue of stand-alone
agreement(s) named as 'software license agreement(s)'.
40\. In all the DTAA with the countries Reliance purchased software, the terms
of DTAA are similar, though restricted in meaning when compared to definition
of Royalty under the Income Tax Act 1961\.

received as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial,
commercial, or scientific equipment, other than payments derived by an

10\. United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland: Article 13(3) For the
purposes of this Article, the term "royalties" means: a. payments of any kind
received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright
of a literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films or

payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right to
use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, other than income
derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or
aircraft in international traffic.
11\. Netherlands: Chapter III Article 12(4) The term "royalties" as used in
this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the
use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific
work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model,
plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial,
commercial or scientific experience.
The words used are similar and the same was considered by honble Karnataka
High court in the case of Synopsis( supra) as under.
39\. It is no doubt true the provisions of the DTAA overrides the provisions
of the Income-tax Act. In the DTAA the term 'royalty' means payments of any
kind received as a consideration for the use or the right to use any copyright
of literary, artistic or scientific work whereas in the Income-tax Act,
royalty means consideration for the transfer of all or any rights including
the granting of a licence. Therefore, under the DTAA to constitute royalty
there need not be any transfer of or any rights in respect of any copyright.
It is sufficient if consideration is received for use of or the right to use
any copyright. Therefore, if the definition of royalty in the DTAA is taken
into consideration it is not necessary there should be a transfer of any
exclusive right. A mere right to use or the use of a copyright falls within
the mischief of Explanation (2) to clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 9
and is liable to tax. Therefore, we do not see any substance in the said
contention.
Further the Ho'ble High Court in the case of Samsung electronics also
considered similarly as under:
> In view of the abovesaid observations and the contents of the DTAA with
> different countries, wherein the definition of "royalty" is common in all
> the agreements, it is necessary to reproduce the said definition of
> 'royalty' in article 12 of the DTAA, which reads as under :
> "Article 12 of DTAA with the USA (see [1991] 187 ITR (St.) 102, 115) :
> 12\. Royalties and fees for included services-
> 96 Reliance and Lucent Group (1) Royalties and fees for included services
> arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other
> Contracting State may be taxed in that other State . . .
> (3) The term 'royalties', as used in this article, means :
> (a) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the
> right to use, any copyright of a literary, artistic, or scientific work,
> including cinematograph films or work on film, tape or other means of
> reproduction for use in connection with radio or television broadcasting,
> any patent, trade mark, design or model plan, secret formula or process, or
> for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific expe-rience,
> including gains derived from the alienation of any such right or property
> which are contingent on the productivity, use or disposition thereof ; and
> (b) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the
> right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equip-ment, other
> than payments derived by an enterprise described in paragraph (1) of article
> 8 (Shipping and Air Transport) from activities described in paragraph (2)(c)
> or (3) of article 8."
> In view of the abovesaid definition of "royalty", it is clear that the
> necessary ingredient to be satisfied to find out as to whether the payment
> would amount to "royalty" is as follows-
> -payment of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the
> right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work.
> It has been universally accepted that a literary work is entitled to

> copyright. In India, the provisions of section 2(o) of the Copyright Act,
> 1957, defines "lite-rary work" as under :
> "'literary work' includes computer programmes, tables and compi-lations
> including computer databases Therefore, "computer software" has been
> recognized as copyright work in India also.
41\. Further, In the case of Citrix Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd 343 ITR 001,
The AAR on similar facts considered and held:-
> When a software is created by a person who acquires a copyright for it, he
> becomes the owner of that copyright. He can transfer or license that right
> either by himself or through an agent. When he sells or licenses the
> software for use, he also sells or licenses the right to use the copyright
> embedded therein. If a software is used without being lawfully acquired
> either by purchase or by license, that would amount to an infringement of
> the copyright because of the copyright embedded in the software. The
> software is a literary work and the copyright of the creator over the
> software is an important and commercially valuable right. So, whenever a
> software is assigned or licensed for use, there is involved an assignment of
> the right to use the embedded copyright in the software or a license to use
> the embedded copyright, the intellectual property right in the software. It
> is not possible to divorce the software from the intellectual property right
> of the creator of the software embedded therein. Even the right to sell or
> give on rental, would amount to a copyright and would be a right to be dealt
> with as a copyright.
The definition of "royalty" in the Income-tax Act, 1961 is, consideration for
the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in
respect of a patent, innovation, model, 97 Reliance and Lucent Group design,
secret formula or process or trade mark or similar property. Consideration for
grant of the use of any of the above is also royalty. It also takes in the
consideration for the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of
a license) in respect of any copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work.
License is not confined to an exclusive license. When a software, over which a
copyright is acquired and thus owned, is licensed for use to another or sold
to another for his own use, the licensee or the purchaser gets the right to
use the software without being held guilty of infringement of the copyright.
When the use of software, without anything more, would render the user liable
for infringement of the copyright embedded in the software, the sale or the
licensing of the software involves the grant of a right to use the copyright
in the software and right to use the intellectual property embedded in the
software. Therefore, the licensing of a software for use by the end-use
customer, is not the mere sale of a copyrighted article.
The words within brackets, "including the granting of a license" indicate an
expansive definition. The word "includes" is an inclusive definition and
expands the meaning. Therefore, license cannot be restricted to transfer of a
right dealt with earlier by the provision and should be understood as taking
in the grant of a license simpliciter. Article 12 of the Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement between India and Australia (DTAA) defines "royalties" to
mean "payment made as consideration for the use of or the right to use any
copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade
mark or other like property or right". When the DTAA speaks of royalty, and
defines it, it must be understood as it is commonly understood. The article
speaks of the use of or the right to use any copyright. Use of a copyright
takes place when the copyright is used. This is distinct from the right to use
a copyright. The two expressions are used disjunctively and the expression
used is "or". The context does not warrant the reading of "or" as "and". If
so, the consideration received for permitting another to use a copyright is
also royalty.
A copyrighted article is nothing but an article which incorporates the
copyright of the owner, the assignee, the exclusive licensee or the licensee.
So, when a copyrighted article is permitted or licensed to be used for a fee,
the permission involves not only the physical or electronic manifestation of a
programme, but also the use of or the right to use the copyright embedded
therein.
That apart, article 12(3) of the DTAA defines royalties as payments, whether
periodical or not and, however, described or computed, as consideration for
"the use of, or the right to use any copyright, patent, design or model, plan,
secret formula or process, trade mark or other like property or right". The
definition is wider than that contained in the Act. It also ropes in payment
of consideration for the use of a copyright in addition to the consideration
paid for the right 98 Reliance and Lucent Group to use a copyright, covered by
the definition in the Act. Consideration paid for use of a copyrighted
software is also payment for use of the copyright embedded in the software.
There cannot be a use of software, over which exists a copyright, without a
use of the copyright therein. The payment for such use can only be royalty.
The sale or licensing for use of a copyrighted software amounts to the grant
of a right to use a copyright.
P. No. 30 of 1999, In re [1999] 238 ITR 296 (AAR) relied on a ruling by the
Authority is based on the facts involved in the application leading to that
ruling. The doctrine of precedent cannot be applied to a ruling under section
245R(4) of the Act. The Act has itself made it clear that the ruling is
binding on the applicant in the application and the Revenue, in respect of
that application and the transaction involved therein.
The applicant, a company incorporated in Australia and provider of software
services, entered into agreements with Indian distributors for the
distribution and sale of its software and hardware products in India. In the
year 2006, the applicant entered into a distribution agreement with I, an
Indian company engaged in the business of distribution of computer software
and hardware, under which I was appointed non-exclusive distributor of the
pro-ducts of the applicant in India. For the software product, Citrix XenApp,
while sale and collection was made through the distributor, no physical
delivery of the product was made to the distributor. On the basis of the
demand of the customers, the distributor placed orders of purchase with the
applicant and made payments to the applicant. The applicant then directly
transmitted a "key" to the end-user customer who, on receipt of the key,
downloaded the software from the server of the applicant. In addition, I also
facilitated the execution of the Citrix subscription advantage programme
between the applicant and its existing customers. The programme was a package
of support services during the period of the programme, including product
version updates, subscription advantage news and updates and secure portal
access. The applicant sought an advance ruling on the taxability in India of
payments made by I to it for the software product, Citrix XenApp and the
subscription advantage programme. The questions framed by the Authority were
whether the payments received by the applicant from the distributor for sale
of the software product were in the nature of "royalty" within the meaning of
the term in Explanation 2 to clause (vi) of section 9(1) of the Income-tax
Act, 1961, or within the meaning of the term in article 12 of the Double
Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Australia, whether the payments
received by the applicant from the distributor for the right to
download/receive version updates for the software products of the- applicant
were in the nature of "royalty" within the meaning of the term in Explanation
2 to clause (vi) of section 9(1) of 99 Reliance and Lucent Group the Act,
whether the payments received by the applicant from the distributor for the
Citrix subscription advantage programme were in the nature of "fees for
technical services" within the meaning of the term in Explanation 2 to clause
(vii) of section 9(1) of the Act, whether the payment received by the
applicant from the distributor for the Citrix subscription advantage
programme, was in the nature of "royalty" within the meaning of the term in
article 12 of the DTAA and in the light of the declaration provided by the
applicant that it did not have a permanent establishment in India in terms of
article 5 of the DTAA, whether the payment received by the applicant was
chargeable to tax in India and would the receipts by the applicant from the
distributor suffer withholding tax under section 195 of the Income-tax Act,
1961, and at what rate.
The Authority on the stated facts, ruled :
> (i) That the payments received by the applicant from the distributor for
> sales of the software products were in the nature of royalty within the
> meaning of section 9(1)(vi) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
> (ii) That the payments concerned would be royalty as defined in article 12
> of the DTAA between India and Australia.
> (iii) That the payment received by way of subscription for the updates would
> also be payment received for grant of a right to use the copyright embedded
> in the subscription advantage programme and it will be royalty.
> (iv) That it was not necessary to rule on the question whether the payment
> for subscription advantage programme would be in the nature of fees for
> technical services within the meaning of the Income-tax Act.
> (v) That the payment received by the applicant from the distributor for the
> Citrix subscription advantage programme was royalty within the meaning of
> clause (a) of article 12(3) of the DTAA between India and Australia. It was
> not necessary to consider the question whether it would fall under clause
> (g) of article 12(3) of the DTAA.
> (vi) Even accepting that the applicant did not have a permanent
> establishment in India, the amount was liable to be taxed in India under
> article 12(2) of the DTAA.
> (vii) That the distributor I was required to withhold taxes in India at the
> time of making payments to the applicant in terms of section 195 of the
> Income- tax Act at the rate of 10 per cent. of the gross amount of royalty,
> as provided under article 12(2) of the DTAA.
> 100 Reliance and Lucent Group
> 42\. In the case of Microsoft Corporation vs. ADTT/Gracemac Corporation 42
> SOT 550, ITAT Delhi Bench has held that payment made for grant of license in
> respect of copyright by end user is taxable as Royalty as per section
> 9(i)(vi).
43\. In the case of Millennium Software Ltd. 338 ITR 391, it was held by AAR
that the consideration received by the applicant, a similar company, from ICEL
for giving it the right to use its copyright software and use it for latter's
own purposes whenever and whatever needed by it is in India as Royalty under
clause V of Explanation 2 of section 9(i(vi) as well as under section 12.2 of
India - Sri Lanka DTAA and consequently, provision of withholding tax under
section 195 is applicable.
44\. In the case of Labs India P. Ltd. 287 ITR 450 (AAR) has held that Article
12 defines Royalty to mean payments of any kind received as consideration for
the use of or right to use any industrial, commercial scientific equipment,
the software application of non-resident is ruled to be scientific equipment,
licensed to be used for commercial purpose. Therefore payment is in the nature
of Royalty and were subject to TDS.
45\. In the case of CIT vs. Wipro Ltd. 203 Taxman 621 (Kar) it was held that
'G; had maintained a database and it had granted online access of the same to
the assessee, therefore, the payment made by the assessee for license to use
the database maintained by G was to be treated as Royalty.
46\. It is clear that under various agreements, what is transferred is only a
licence to use the copyright belonging to the non-resident, subject to the
terms and conditions of the agreement, as referred to above, and the non-
resident supplier continues to be the owner of the copyright and all other
intellectual property rights. It is well settled that copyright is a negative
right. It is an umbrella of many rights and licence is granted for making use
of the copyright in respect of shrink wrapped software/off-the-shelf software
under the respective agreement, which authorizes the end user, i.e., the 101
Reliance and Lucent Group customer to make use of the copyright software
contained in the said software, which is purchased off the shelf or imported
as shrink wrapped software. The same would amount to transfer of part of the
copyright and transfer of right to use the copyright for internal business as
per the terms and conditions of the agreement. Therefore, the contention that
there is no transfer of copyright or any part thereof under the agreements
entered into by the Reliance with the non-resident supplier of software cannot
be accepted. Under these circumstances, payment made by the Reliance to LTGL/
other suppliers can be said to be payment for the use of or right to use of
copyright and does amount to royalty within the meaning of Artilce- 12(3) of
the DTAA. It is accordingly held that the AO was justified in directing to
deduct the tax at source u/s.195.
47\. As can be seen from the paper books filed in this regard, many of the
software license agreements are common and more or less similarly worded, and
involves purchase of software by way of granting license. The agreement in the
case of M/s Lucent was already extracted by the authorities and we are of the
opinion that we need not discuss the same. In fact the Reliance also admitted
that there were only supply of software, without purchase of equipments either
from the same party or from any other party. There are certain agreements
which are only 'License agreements' and are not seller or vendor agreements as
in other cases. The exclusive License agreements are in the following cases.
1\. Clarity International Ltd, Australia ( PB 654-682) vide agreement dt
29/03/05 assigned to Reliance Communications by Reliance Industries. ( ITA

agreement with New Skies Satellites NV, Netherlands is for hiring transponder
which will be dealt with later separately ( ITA Nos 5374/m/08, 6093/M/08).
49\. Therefore, we hold that Ld. CIT(A) erred in treating that there is no
necessity to deduct Tax holding. We are conscious of the fact that the appeals
are in the context of deduction under section 195. As held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Transmission Corporation of AP Ltd. vs CIT 239
ITR 587 (SC), the tax has to be deducted at source on sum chargeable under the
Act in the case of non-residents under section 195(1). Section 195 repose a
statutory obligation on any person responsible for paying to non-resident any
interest (not being interest of securities) or any other sum (not being
dividend) chargeable under the provisions of the Act to deduct income tax at
the rate in force unless he is liable to pay income tax thereon as an agent.
The assessee did deduct the tax as per the directions of the AO under section
195(2). Since we have come to the conclusion that the amount paid by Reliance
is to be treated as Royalty chargeable under the Act of the Income Tax, the
order of the AO to that extent are upheld. We have also kept in mind the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Agagrwal Chamber of
Commerce Ltd. vs. Ganapat Rai Hira Lal 33 ITR 245 (SC) wherein it was held
that persons who are bound under section 195 to make deduction of income tax
at the time of making payments of any income, profits of gains are not
concerned with the ultimate results of the assessment of the non-resident
persons from whose income they deducted and paid income tax in India. In case
of any of the recipients are aggrieved, they can file a return and claim the
amount as not taxable as was the case 104 Reliance and Lucent Group in the
appeal of Motorola, Nokia and Erickson (Supra) wherein those assessees
contested that the amounts they received are not taxable. As seen from the
appeal of M/s Lucent also, they have chosen not to file returns and take
credit for the tax deducted at source initially. Only in the proceedings under
section 147, the issue about taxability has been raised in the appeals.
Otherwise like many of the other recipients, they would not have contested the
taxability of income. As we have held that these amounts are taxable as
Royalty, to that extent we uphold that the direction of the AO to deduct tax
under section 195.
50\. Consequently, In all the Revenue appeals against Reliance, (except ITA
No.5374 and ITA No.6093 which are separately dealt later) orders of the CIT(A)
are set aside and orders of the AO are restored.
ITA Nos.7001 to 7004/ M/10. Lucent Technologies GRL LLC
51\. These appeals pertain to Lucent Technologies, GRL LLC. As briefly stated
above, the issue in these appeals is with reference to the taxability of the
amounts received from supply of software to Reliance. The AO held the same as
royalty in nature and in the alternate, also considered that there is a PE in
India and so the business profits are attributable to the PE. Along with the
above two issues there are issues on non-granting of TDS credited, levy of
interest also.
52\. The issue of royalty was considered above in detail and consequent to the
findings therein, it is considered that amounts paid by Reliance for supply of
software under a licence agreement is to be considered as royalty under the
provisions of the Act and also under DTAA and liable to tax in India.
Accordingly, the grounds raised by Lucent from Ground No.2 to 5 are rejected.
53\. The next issue to be considered is attribution of business profit to the
PE. Vide para 4.18 of the order of the AO for the impugned year,, the AO gave
a finding that payment made for software would be termed as royalty payments
and necessary tax rates have been mentioned in the table.
105 Reliance and Lucent Group Further, considering the agreements entered by
Reliance with Lucent Group the AO was of the opinion that there existed an
Agency PE. Vide para 5.8 of the order the AO also considered that in case it
is held that assessee's income is not taxable as royalty, the assessee's
business profits have to be worked out in view of it having a PE in India. We
have already held that payments made by Reliance have to be considered as
royalty and accordingly the same are to be taxable as royalty only. Therefore,
there is no need to consider the same as business profits. However, the issue
of PE has to be decided, as existence of PE makes business profit taxable in
India. Therefore, it is necessary to give a finding on the existence of PE to
the assessee Lucent.
54\. The AO invoking provisions of Article-5 of DTAA, was of the opinion that
an agency PE is coming into picture as substantive functions of negotiations,
entering into contract, stocking of goods or merchandising is being done by
India enterprise i.e., LTHPL. He referred to various terms of agreement
entered between the parties particularly the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, including the scope of services for maintenance of software entered
by LTHPL. The AO was of the opinion that in this case, not only original
agreement has been entered into by the Indian Company but services relating to
making software operation or warranties or maintenance were also being done by
LTHPL only. In addition to that terms of the agreements , the AO also relied
on documents found in the course of survey in the premises of Alcatel Lucent
International Ltd. (got merged entity of LTHPL) more particularly with respect
to letter of agreement dated 06.09.2008 between group concerns with Reliance
Communications regarding restructure of payment mile stone. The AO ultimately
concluded that there existed an agency PE and accordingly, since assessee has
a PE in India, the business profits are taxable and worked out profits at 32%
of the total receipts.
55\. It was the submission of the assessee that LTHPL was acting independently
and assessee has no agency agreement or no business 106 Reliance and Lucent
Group connection in India except supply of software. It was also further
submitted that no service personnel came to India so as to come under Service
PE. The ld. Counsel for the assessee also relied on Article-5 of the DTAA and
decision of co-ordinate Bench in the case of Western Union Financial Services
Inc. vs. ADIT (104 ITD 34)(Del.) to submit that mere use of software for the
purpose of business in India need not lead to an agency PE as assessee was not
rendering any service in India nor LTHPL is authorized to deal with outsiders
on behalf of assessee Lucent. Further, it was submitted that the co-ordinate
Bench in the case of Lucent Technologies International Inc. vs. DCIT, Non-
resident Circle (28 SOT 98) considered the facts in the case to hold that
there is a service PE in that case. It was submitted that mere existence of a
PE to a group company does not lead to a finding that the assessee also as a
PE in India. It was further submitted that AO's reliance on a document i.e.,
subsequent restructured agreement for payment by the group companies does not
indicate that any one of them is authorized to enter into contract on behalf
of the assessee Lucent and further, agreement was dated 06.09.2008 does not
pertain to any of the impugned assessment years. Nothing was brought on record
by the Revenue that there is a PE except relying on the so called agreement
which was entered on a principle to principle basis.
56\. The ld. Counsel however relied on the orders that the AO as supported by
DRP. It was further submitted that assessee chose not to file return after TDS
was made and therefore, since proceedings are initiated under section 148
assessee can not seek any benefit in the proceedings initiated for the benefit
of the revenue . He relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the
case of K. Sudhakar S. Shanbhag Vs ITO (241 ITR 865) for the proposition of
"doctrine of election".
57\. We have considered the rival submissions. In the case of Lucent
Technologies International Inc. (28 SOT 98) the co-ordinate Bench at Delhi
considered the facts and held as under :-
> The agreement entered into between the assessee-company and the Indian
> Company, Escotel, as also the agreement entered into between 107 Reliance
> and Lucent Group Escotel and the Indian subsidiary, LTIL showed that the
> agreements were for two different purposes. The agreement between Escotel
> and the assessee was for the supply of the hardware and software; the
> agreement between Escotel and LTIL was for commissioning, installation and
> operations. However, both the agreements provided for the turnkey
> functioning of the project of the GSM network. Therefore, by entering into
> the contract with both, the assessee and LTIL, Escotel had made both the
> assessee and LTIL responsible for the turnkey completion of the GSM project,
> individually and severely. Thus, if either one would break its terms and
> conditions of the agreement with Escotes, the other would be responsible for
> its completion. Thus, consortium or partnership had been created between the
> assessee and its Indian subsidiary, LTIL. With that situation, the next
> question for consideration arose as to whether either the assessee or its
> subsidiary, LTIL could complete the contract with Escotel on a turnkey basis
> without the assistance of the other. Obviously, the assessee was to supply
> the hardware and the software and LTIL was to do the installation, testing,
> commissioning and bringing up to operational stage the turnkey project. If
> the assessee did not provide the hardware and the software, it would be the
> duty of LTIL to provide the requisite hardware and the software for the
> completion of the turnkey project.
Similarly, if LTIL did not comply with its duties of commissioning,
installation, testing and bringing up to operational stage the turnkey
project, such responsibility would rest on the shoulders of the assess. There
was no dispute in that the assessee had completed part of its contract, i.e.,
the supply of the hardware and the software. The installation, commissioning,
testing and bringing up to operational state of the hardware and the software
supplied by the assessee had been undertaken by the Indian Subsidiary, LTIL.
For said purpose, LTIL had also taken the assistance of the employees of the
affiliates of the assessee. Thus, the parent company, being the assessee had
made personnel available to the LTIL, the subsidiary in form of the employees
of the affiliates of the assessee at certain remuneration. Further, a perusal
of the agreement between Escotel and the assessee clearly showed that the
warranty provided by the assessee-company was in relation to the defects in
the hardware. That warranty clause in identical form was also found in the
agreement entered into between Escotel and LTIL. Normally, the warranty for a
particular product to be supplied by one person is the responsibility of that
person alone, but in the instant case, that burden was also shifted to the
subsidiary, being LTIL. Though LTIL had certified that it did not keep any
spares on behalf of the assessee for the equipments supplied by the assessee
under the contract with Escotel, yet the fact that LTIL had also assumed the
responsibilities of the warranty in regard to the hardware supplied by the
assess, as also the responsibility to replace the same within the period
specified in the support contract between Escotel and LTIL clearly showed that
the subsidiary, LTIL was also acting on behalf of the assessee. A perusal of
article 5(2)(1) of the DTAA between India and the USA clearly shows that it is
not only the employees through whom if services are provided, the PE is to
said to come into existence, it also includes other personnel. Obviously, the
term 108 Reliance and Lucent Group 'other personnel' has to be read with
reference to the earlier words, as provided in the said article 5(2)(1). The
other personnel specified would be the persons over whom the enterprise would
be having a control. In the instant case, undisputedly, employees of the
affiliates of the assessee had been employed through LTIL for providing the
services of installation, commissioning, testing and bringing up to
operational stage of the hardware and the software sold by the assessee to
Escotel through its contract in regard to GSM project which was to be
completed on a turnkey basis. Those employees of the affiliates over whom the
assessee had a control would fall within the term 'other personnel' and,
consequently, it would have to be held that a PE did exist as per the
inclusive term as provided in article 5(2)(1) of the DTAA. A copy of the
returns of the aforesaid employees also clearly showed that they had been
staying in India for more than 90 days within the 12 month period from April,
1996 to March, 1997. Consequently, the requirements of article 5(2)(1) of the
DTAA were fulfilled. In such circumstances, it was to be held that LTIL, in
fact, was a service PE of the assessee-company. As a result, the findings of
the Commissioner (Appeals) on the aforesaid issues were to be set aside."
58\. However, the facts in the present case are different for the above case.
Here LTHPL entered into an agreement for supply of hardware, software and also
installation and that company is an Indian company. After entering into an
agreement supply of software was assigned to the assessee Lucent by way of the
Tripartite agreement between Reliance and LTHPL and assessee Lucent.
Eventhough, installation was on Indian company there is no evidence of either
deputing personnel of assessee Lucent to India nor there is any evidence in
the record for invoking Service PE as in other case. Moreover for invoking
Agency PE , facts do not support AO's contentions. The agreement entered is an
independent agreement, entered on principle to principle basis and nowhere the
Indian company has authorized or has undertaken any responsibility of the
assessee Lucent. On the facts of the case we are of the opinion that there do
not exist any PE, more so of agency PE. It is also not the case of the Revenue
that the assessee deputed its personnel to India so as to invoke Service PE as
per Indo-US DTAA. In view of the above, we hold that there is no PE to the
assessee company in India and as there is neither any office in India nor it
has any business connection in India nor carried out any business activities
in India. Assessee's company is a standalone legal independent entity.
Therefore, 109 Reliance and Lucent Group assessee's ground nos. 6 to 12 are
upheld, as there is no PE in India, so attribution of profits does not arise.
59\. Non granting of TDS credit:- AO did not give credit to the TDS claimed by
assessee. At the outset it was submitted that this issue is covered by the
decision of co-ordinate Bench of the Tribunal in assessee's own case in 45 SOT
311 Lucent technologies GRL LLC vs. DR. director IT (Intl. taxation)
Circle-4(1(, Mumbai wherein it was held :-
> "The assessee-company with fiscal domicile in U.S.A. was engaged in business

might have even returned the monies, but assessee could not be expected to get
into these aspects of the matter. in the instant appeal, one was confined to
the issue that the assessee, from whose payments taxes had been deducted at
source and who was also in receipt of the appropriate certificates in
accordance with the scheme of the Act, must get credit admissible under
section 199 and that such a credit was not declined on the basis of an action
which was neirher contemplated by the provisions of the Act, nor even in the
control of the assessee. [Para 9] In view of the above discussions, the
Assessing Officer was directed to grant due credit to the assessee, on the
basis of original tax deduction at source certificates produced by the
assessee, in accordance with the law and as long as taxes so deducted had been
paid over to the Government and certificates in respect of the same had been
issued by the tax deductor uninfluenced by any refunds subsequently granted to
the tax deductor. The refund made to the tax deductor, even if wrongful, had
no adverse impact on the rights of the assessee. Therefore, the Assessing
Officer was directed to grant credit for tax deducted at source, in accordance
with the law." [Para 10] Respectfully following the coordinate bench
decision,we direct AO to give credit to the tax deducted at source.
Accordingly ground No.13 is allowed.
60\. Ground Nos. 14, 15 16 pertain to levy of interest u/s. 234A, 234B and
234D. It was submitted that there was TDS on payment made to assessee Lucent
Technologies GRL LLC by Reliance and therefore, there is 111 Reliance and
Lucent Group no liability u/s. 234B. Issue is also covered in favour of the
assessee by the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of DIT
(Intl. taxation) vs. NGC Networks Asia LLC (313 ITR 187). In that case it was
held that when a duty was cast on the payer to deduct the tax at source, on
failure of the payer to do so, no interest could be imposed on assessee.
However, in this case TDS was already made while paying to the assessee
Lucent, eventhough Assessing Officer denied credit for certain administrative
reasons. Since the amount was covered by TDS question of levy u/s. 234B does
not arise. Issue of 234A and 234D are consequential in nature. Therefore does
not require any adjudication. Accordingly, ground No.14 and 16 are rejected
and ground No.15 is allowed.
61\. Ground No.17 is with respect to penalty. The assessee is contesting the
initiation of penalty proceedings u/s. 271(1)(c). There is no right of appeal
on initiation of proceedings and since proceedings are not yet finalized, it
is little pre-mature to contest. This ground does not require any
adjudication.
62\. In the result, four appeals of Lucent are partly allowed.
ITA No.5374/M/07 and ITA No.6093/ M/ 08.
63\. The issue in these two appeals of the Revenue is with reference to the
payments made to M/s. New Skies Satellite N.V., Hague, Netherland for purchase
of satellite Band width capacity, as per agreement dated 12.12.2002,
subsequently amended on 18.12.2002. Reliance approached Assessing Officer for
making payment without deduction of tax. Assessing Officer examined the issue
and held that the payment being made was royalty and tax was required to be
deducted at source. After deducting the tax, Reliance approached ld. CIT(A) in
appeal to submit that the amount paid can not be considered as royalty and
since the said company did not have a PE in India there is no tax. It relied
on the decision of DCIT vs. Pan Amsat International Systems Inc. (103 TTJ 861)
to submit that payments for 112 Reliance and Lucent Group purchase of band
width is not royalty income but only business income. The ld. CIT(A) while
noting down that AO relied on the decision of ITAT in the case of Asia
Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd. vs. DCIT (85 ITD 478) however, relied on
the above referred decision in the case of DCIT vs. Pan Amsat International
Systems Inc. (supra) and also the decision of Bangalore Bench in the case of
Software Technology Parks of India vs. Income Tax Officer (3 SOT 529) and also
interpreting the payments in the case of subscriber fee for cellular mobile
telephone facility of Skycell Communication Ltd. vs. DCIT (251 ITR 053) held
that purchase of bandwidth can not be considered as royalty and is to be
considered as business profit. Since M/s. New Skies Satellite does not have a
PE in India, its business profits are not taxable in India. Revenue is
aggrieved and has raised the following grounds.
ITA No.5374/Mum/07 "1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and
in law, the ld. CIIT(A) erred in deciding that AO was not justified in the
case in directing to deduct tax at source u/s. 195 of the IT Act.
2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
CIIT(A) erred in holding that no income accrues to M/s. New Skies Satellites
N.V. Rooseveltplantsoen 4, 2517 KR, The Hague, The Netherlands in India
against the payment of US$17,00,000/- per annum for the supply of satellite
bandwidth for use in the Reliance Telecom Network.
3\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
CIIT(A) failed to appreciate that the payment for obtaining computer software
is in the nature of royalty which is liable for taxation in India.
ITA No.6093/Mum/08
1\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
CIIT(A) erred in holding that the payment made to M/s. New 113 Reliance and
Lucent Group Skies Satellite N.V. for purchase of certain telecommunication
Satellite Band Width Capacity (Software) amounts to business receipts and in
the absence of any Permanent Establishment in India, the business profit
arising in the transaction is not taxable in India.
2\. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the ld.
CIIT(A) failed to appreciate that the payment for the purchase of software is
in the nature of "Royalty" which is liable for taxation in India.
3\. The appellant prays that the order of the ld. CIT(A) on the above grounds
be set aside and that of the AO restored."
64\. These two cases were also argued along with other group cases. On this
set of facts, the issue is not purchase of software but purchase of bandwidth
for providing transponder capacity to telecommunication companies. The case
was decided by Special Bench of ITAT, in New Skies Satellite N.V. vs. ADIT
(Intl. taxation) in 319 ITR (AT) 269 (Del.)(SB), wherein it was held that
service rendered amounts to royalty. The facts and decision of the Special
Bench of the ITAT is as under :-
> The assessees were non-resident satellite companies and earned income from
> telecasting companies in India for providing them transponder capacity. The
> assessee were engaged in operating telecommunication satellites which were
> called geostationary satellites and were placed at the distance of around
> 36,000 kms. From the equator. A satellite could typically consist of 20 to
> 30 trnasponders, each operating on a particular frequency within a frequency
> range allocated to that satellite. Through such transponders installed at
> satellite, the assessee's provided transponder capacity of data transmission
> to their customers, which were telecasting companies /telecom operators. In
> turn, the telecasting companies/ telecom operators provided
> broadcasting/telecommunication services to their customers. The telecasting
> companies/telecom operators while relaying the programmes whether live or
> recorded to their customers and used their earth stations to uplink the data
> to satellite 114 Reliance and Lucent Group which was received by their earth
> stations in the downlinking process from where these telecasting
> companies/telecom operators provided the telecasting facilities to their
> customers. These telecasting companies /telecom operators entered into
> agreements with these assessees for obtaining transponder's capacity to
> enable themselves to uplink and downlink the programmes to be telecasted.
> For obtaining such transponder capacity and agreed amount was to be paid
> periodically as stated in the respective agreements. These receipts were
> taxed by the Department as "royalty" either under the provisions of the
> Income-tax Act, 1961 or under the provisions of the respective Double
> Taxation Avoidance Agreement.
On appeal to the Tribunal.
Held, by the Special Bench of the Tribunal, that process was involved in the
transponder through which the telecasting companies were able to uplink the
desired images/data and downlink it in the desired area which, inter alia,
covered Indian territory. For holding that consideration was received in
respect of royalty, it was not necessary that the instruments through which
the process was carried on should be in the control or possession of the
person who is receiving the payment. The context and factual situation had to
be kept in mind while finding out whether a process was actually used by the
payer. In the case of satellites, physical control and possession of the
process could neither be with the satellite companies nor with the telecasting
companies. The control of the process, by either of them could be through
sophisticated instruments either installed at the ground stations owned by the
satellite companies or through the instruments installed at the earth stations
owned and operated by the telecasting companies. The use of process, according
to agreement, was provided by the satellite companies to the telecasting
companies whereby the telecasting companies were enable to telecast their
programmes by uplinking and downlinking the same with the help of that
process. The 115 Reliance and Lucent Group time of telecast and the nature of
programme, all depended upon the telecasting companies and, thus, they were
using that process. The term "secret" appearing in the phrase " secret formula
or process" in Explanation 2 to section 9(1) (vi) and in the relevant article
of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement does not qualify the work
"process". Therefore, to fall within the meaning of royalty as envisaged in
these provisions, it is not necessary that the services rendered must be
through "secret process" only. The consideration received by the assessee for
the use of the "process" in transponder, even if it was not protected, would
be covered within the definition of "royalty" as the provisions do not specify
the process to be protected. Even services rendered through simple process
will be covered within the meaning of royalty. The payments received by the
assessee from their customers were on account of use of process involved in
the transponder and they amounted to royalty within the meaning of clause
(iii) and (vi) of Explanation 2 to section 9(1)(vi) of the Income tax Act,
1961. they also amounted to royalty within the meaning of the respective
articles of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements.
Respectfully following the above decision of the Special Bench, we hold that
the payment made by Reliance to New Skies Satellite N.V. is in the nature of
royalty and taxable in India. Therefore Assessing Officer's order is to be
upheld. Consequentially orders of CIT(A) are set aside and that of AO
