PER KULDIP SINGH, JUDICIAL MEMBER :
2 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 Present cross appeals filed by the assessee as well as by
the revenue are being disposed of by way of consolidated order to avoid
repetition of discussion.
2\. The Appellant, United Group Information Services Private Limited
(hereinafter referred to as 'the taxpayer') by filing the present appeal being
ITA No.825/Del/2014 sought to set aside the impugned order dated 20.12.2013,
passed by the AO in consonance with the orders passed by the ld. DRP/TPO under
section 143 (3) read with section 144C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short
'the Act') qua the assessment year 2009-10 on the grounds inter alia that :-
> "1. That, the impugned order of assessment framed by the learned Deputy
> Commissioner of Income-tax, Circle 18(1), New Delhi (hereinafter referred to
> as 'the learned AO') pursuant to the directions of the Hon'ble Dispute
> Resolution Panel - II (hereinafter referred to as 'the Hon'ble DRP') under
> section 143(3) read with section 144C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ('Act'),
> is a vitiated order having been passed in violation of principles of natural
> justice and is otherwise arbitrary and is thus bad in law and is void ab-
> initio.
> 2\. That, without prejudice, the learned AO has grossly erred in making a
> transfer pricing addition of Rs.277,999,266/- and a corporate tax addition
> of Rs.14,857,889 while computing the income of the Appellant. The addition
> made to the returned income is highly unjustified and also suffers from
> mistakes apparent from record.
> 3\. That the Hon'ble DRP has committed gross errors in confirming the order
> passed u/s 92CA(3) of the Act by the learned Transfer Pricing officer (the
> learned TPO') proposing a transfer pricing adjustment to the actual value of
> the international transactions of the Appellant with its associated
> enterprises and only granting a partial relief thereof.
3 ITA No.825/Del/2014
> ITA No.419/Del/2014
4\. That on the facts and in law, the learned TPO has grossly erred in
treating foreign exchange gain/ loss as non-operating item while determining
the arm's length price of the international transactions of the Appellant
without considering the terms & conditions of the inter-company transactions
of the Appellant.
5\. The learned AO/TPO/DRP has erred by not making appropriate adjustments on
account of working capital differences between the Appellant vis-a-vis the
comparables companies, without appreciating the fact that the similar
adjustment has been allowed to the Appellant in the assessment year 2007-08 &
assessment year 2010-11. Thus, in the absence of any substantial change in the
functional profile of the Appellant and following the principle of res
judicata, the benefit of working capital adjustment should be allowed for AY
2009-10 as well.
6\. That without prejudice, on the fact and the circumstances of the case and
in law, the learned TPO / Hon'ble DRP has erred in not allowing a risk
adjustment to the Assessee on account of the fact that the Appellant is a
captive service provider for its associated enterprises and is remunerated on
a cost plus basis irrespective of the outcome of the services provided and
hence undertakes no market risk, service liability risk, credit and collection
risk as against comparable companies that are the full fledged risk taking
entrepreneurs.
7\. That, in framing the impugned assessment, the reference made by the
learned AO u/s 92CA (1) of the Act suffers from jurisdictional error, as the
learned AO had not recorded any reasons nor he had any material whatsoever on
the basis of which he could even reach a prima-facie opinion, that it was
'necessary or expedient' to refer the matter to the learned TPO for
computation of ALP.
8\. That without prejudice, on the facts and circumstances of the case and in
law, the learned AO / TPO / Hon'ble DRP has erred in not allowing the benefit
of downward adjustment of 5 percent, as provided in the Proviso to section 92C
of the Act, from the ALP of the international transactions as determined by
them.
9\. That on the fact and the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
TPO / Hon'ble DRP has erred by not accepting the economic analysis undertaken
by the Appellant in accordance with the provisions of the Act read with the
Rules, and conducting a fresh economic analysis for the determination of the
ALP of the Appellant's international transactions and holding that the
international transactions are not at arm's length.
4 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 10.1 That on the facts and circumstances of the case and
in law, the learned TPO / Hon'ble DRP has erred in rejecting the Appellant's
claim to use multiple year data for computing the arm's length price and,
instead, has adhered to the use of single year updated data to conclude the
ALP of the international transactions.
10.2 Even as otherwise, on the assumption adopted by the learned TPO and
without prejudice to Ground 10.1 above, even if single year updated data of
the comparables selected in the transfer pricing documentation is considered,
then also no transfer pricing adjustment could have been made to the income of
the Appellant.
10.3 That on the facts and the circumstances of the case and in law, the
learned TPO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in selection of functional non comparable
companies and application of arbitrary filters for the purpose of
determination of arm's length price of the international transactions
pertaining to provision of IT and IT enabled services by the Appellant to
associated enterprises.
10\. That on the facts and the circumstances of the case and in law, the
learned TPO / Hon'ble DRP ignored the fact that the Appellant is entitled to a
tax holiday under section 10A of the Act on its profits and therefore does not
have an ulterior motive of shifting profits outside India.
11\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO/ Hon'ble DRP has erred in not allowing deduction under section 10A of the
Act on interest income of Rs. 12,571,932 and miscellaneous income of Rs. INR
1,543,188. 11.1 On the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the
learned AO has erred in not allowing deduction under section 10A of the Act on
'Excess provision written back', amounting to INR 742,769, despite directions
from the Hon'ble DRP to allow the same.
12\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in not granting credit for Tax deducted at source ('1DS') of INR
58,922.
13\. 'That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in not granting credit for Advance tax of INR 27,500,000
deposited by the Appellant for the subject year.
5 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014
14\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in not granting set off of Minimum Alternate Tax ('MAT) credit of
INR 21,654,947 brought forward in the subje~t year, as per section 115JAA of
the Act.
15\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in levying consequential interest under section 2348 and 234C of
the Act.
15.1 That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in levying interest under section 234C of the Act on assessed
income since interest under section 234C of the Act can be levied on returned
income only.
16\. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the learned
AO has erred in initiating penalty proceedings under section 271 (1 )(c) of
the Act."
3\. The Appellant, Deputy Commissioner of Income-tax, Circle 18 (1), New Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Revenue') by filing the present appeal being
ITA No.419/Del/2014 sought to set aside the impugned order dated 20.12.2013,
passed by the AO in consonance with the orders passed by the ld. DRP/TPO under
section 143 (3) read with section 144C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short
'the Act') qua the assessment year 2009-10 on the grounds inter alia that :-
> "i. That the Ld. DRP-II erred in law and facts in allowing part relief of
> Rs.4,24,45,874/- to the assessee in the computation of Arm Length Prices of
> the International Transactions pertaining to the "Provision of ITES" and
> "Software Development Services".
> ii. That the Ld. DRP-II erred in law and facts in accepting the contention
> of the assessee regarding exclusion of M/s. Aricent Tech., M/s. Bodhtree
> Consulting and M/s. Cat Technologies (Provision for Software Development

> iii. That the Ld. DRP-II erred in law and facts in accepting the contention
> of the assessee regarding exclusion of M/s Coral Hub (Provision tor ITES)
> without appreciating the reasons given by TPO and without considering that
> the TPO had selected the comparables keeping in view the broad comparability
> under TNMM.
> iv. That the Ld. DRP-II erred in law and facts in not appreciating the fact
> that the assessee had clubbed the two International Transactions -
> "Provision of Claim Processing Services" and "Provision of Data Analytics
> Services" together, as Provision for ITES, for benchmarking under TNMM in
> the TP Study Report which was followed by the assessee despite the fact that
> "Provision of Claim Processing Services" come under the category of BPO and
> "Provision of Data Analytics Services'' come under the category of KPO and
> thus the comparables were selected by the assessee as well by the TPO from
> the entire spectrum (High End services as well as Low End Services) of ITES.
> v. That the Ld. DRP-II erred in law and facts in not appreciating the fact
> that when the two International Transactions - "Provision of Claim
> Processing Services - BPO Services" and "Provision of Data Analytics
> Services - KPO Services" are clubbed together, as Provision for ITES, for
> benchmarking under TNMM by the assessee (in TP Study Report) and TPO then
> only the broad functional comparability between the comparables and assessee
> can be compared.
> vi. That the order of the DRP-II is erroneous and is not tenable on facts
> and in law.
> vii. That the grounds of appeal are without prejudice to each other."
4\. Briefly stated the facts necessary for adjudication of the controversy at
hand are : United Health Group Insurance Company Limited (UHG India) is into
providing IT Enabled Health care (claim processing, data analytics & clinical
research support services) (hereinafter collectively referred to as "IT
Enabled  7 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 Services" and "IT Software
Development") to UHG Group Companies as a captive service provider. During the
year under assessment, the taxpayer entered into international transactions
with its Associated Enterprises (AE) as under :-

> expenses received - 5,636,108 by UHG India Advance against expenses -
> 12,326,620 Grant of RSU/SAR - Nil
5\. The taxpayer has two segments concerning international transactions viz.
Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) and Software Development
services. The taxpayer in its Transfer Pricing Study used Transactional Net
Margin Method (TNMM) as Most Appropriate Method (MAM) for both the segments
and computed its margin at 13.83% and 13.23% in ITES and Software Development
services respectively.
6\. Ld. Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO), after examining the TP study made by
the taxpayer and on the basis of various filters,  8 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 described in para 3.2 of the TP order made its own TP analysis
by selecting 8 comparables for ITES segment and 18 comparables in software
development segment and calculated their margin at 34.29% and 28.88%
respectively and computed the cumulative adjustment in both the segments to
the tune of Rs.32,04,45,140.
7\. Ld. DRP who has given part relief by excluding Bodhtree Consulting, CAT
Technologies and Aricent Technologies from the final set of comparables qua
software development services and by excluding Coral Hub qua ITES segment for
benchmarking the international transaction. Feeling aggrieved, the taxpayer
has come up before the Tribunal seeking exclusion of 5 comparables and 3
comparables qua software development services and ITES segment respectively
and the taxpayer also sought inclusion of 3 comparables qua ITES segment. The
Revenue also challenged exclusion of Bodhtree, CAT Technology qua software
development segment and Coral Hub in ITES for benchmarking the international
transaction
8\. We have heard the ld. Authorized Representatives of the parties to the
appeal, gone through the documents relied upon and orders passed by the
revenue authorities below in the light of the facts and circumstances of the
case.

TRANSFER PRICING ISSUES
10\. Undisputedly, there is no dispute as to the TNMM used by the taxpayer as
MAM for benchmarking the international transactions. It is also not in dispute
that the taxpayer is a captive service provider to its AE to provide software
development services and ITES services. There is also no change in the
business model of the taxpayer as compared to the preceding years.  11 ITA
No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014
11\. The ld. AR for the taxpayer to cut short the controversy sought exclusion
of 5 comparables, viz., Infosys Technologies Ltd., Persistent Systems Ltd.,
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (Consolidated), Thirdware Solutions Ltd. &
Wipro Ltd. for benchmarking the international transactions qua software
development and inclusion of Quintegra Solutions Ltd. qua software development
and sought exclusion of Accentia Technologies Ltd., Cosmic Global Ltd. &
eClerx Services and sought inclusion of Microland Ltd., R Systems & CG Vak
Software & Exports Ltd. for benchmarking the international transactions qua
ITES segment.
12\. We would examine the exclusion / inclusion of the aforesaid comparables
sought by the taxpayer one by one in the light of the arguments addressed by
ld. AR for the taxpayer and ld. DR for the Revenue.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT INFOSYS TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (INFOSYS)
13\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Infosys on grounds inter alia that it is
functionally dissimilar and incurring significant R&D expenses having
significant intangibles and a giant company having fully risk bearing profile
and relied upon the decision rendered by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal
in taxpayer's  12 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 own case in ITA
No.6312/Del/2012 for AY 2008-09 order dated 28.08.2014.
14\. However, on the other hand, ld. DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders
passed by the AO/DRP.
15\. Perusal of page 1045 of annual reports compendium Vol.IV goes to prove
that Infosys is providing end to end solutions inter alia include business and
technology consulting, custom application development, infrastructure
maintenance services, maintenance and production support, package enabled
consulting and implementation including enterprise solutions, product
engineering solutions and product lifecycle management, systems integration,
valuation solutions and Software as a Service (SaaS) related solutions.
Infosys has developed Finacle universal banking solution empowering 114 banks
across 62 countries helping them serve 25,000 branches 244 million customers
297 million accounts and 2 lakhs million users. Finacle has also emerged as
one of the most scale-able core banking solution in the world by achieving an
unparallel performance benchmark of 104 million effective transactions per
hour.
16\. Furthermore, Infosys is incurring 1.3% of the total revenue on R&D and is
having significant intangibles duly detailed at page 1138 of the annual report
compendium. Perusal of the director's  13 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 report, available at page 1016 of the annual report
compendium, also shows that Infosys is a giant company having gross profit of
Rs.9119 crores.
17\. On the other hand, the ld. Taxpayer is providing services on cost plus
basis having minimum risk and having no intangibles. Infosys has been ordered
to be excluded as a comparable by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of Agnity
India Technologies Pvt. Ltd. - (2013) 219 taxman 26 (Del.) being a giant
company having huge intangibles and incurring substantive amount on R&D and is
a full-fledged risk taking company. More so, Infosys was ordered to be
excluded in taxpayer's own case for AY 2008-09 (supra). In these
circumstances, Infosys is not a suitable comparable vis-à-vis the taxpayer for
benchmarking the international transactions, hence we order to exclude it.
PERSISTENT SYSTEMS LTD. (PERSISTENT)
18\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Persistent on the grounds inter alia
that it is outsourcing its services; that it is also engaged in development of
products with no segmental data available; and that it is expending around 1%
of its total income of Rs.56.1 million on R&D activities. Undisputedly,
Persistent has not been contested by the taxpayer before ld. TPO as well as
ld. DRP. In the given  14 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014
circumstances, we are of the considered view that if something new is to be
examined let it be examined by the ld. TPO first as the taxpayer has preferred
not to contest Persistent before the ld. TPO as well as DRP. So, this issue is
set aside to the ld. TPO to examine afresh after providing an opportunity of
being heard to the taxpayer.
TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD. (TATA)
19\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Tata on ground of functional dis-
similarity; that it is providing IT and consultancy services with no segmental
details of product and services; that it is a leading global brand having huge
intangibles and significant expenses on R&D and that it is a giant risk taking
company and has also undergone various acquisition and divestment during the
year under assessment; that Tata has been ordered to be excluded as a
comparable in AY 2007-08 and 2008-09 in identical cases by the coordinate
Bench of the Tribunal viz., SunLife India Services Centre Pvt. Ltd. in ITA
No.1489/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10 & St. Ericsson India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT
in ITA No.1672/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10.
20\. However, on the other hand, ld. DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders
passed by the AO/DRP.
15 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014
21\. Annual report of the Tata, available at pages 1341 to 1363 of annual
report compendium, goes to prove that Tata is into providing diversified
operations viz. Tata is into IT Infrastructure Services, BPO, ITES,
Engineering and Industrial services; that it is into sale of equipment and
software licence with wide client base and has been conferred with numerous
awards/recognition. Perusal of Page 1420 of the annual report compendium shows
that it is having income from IT and consultancy services, sale of equipment
and software licence but having no segmental data. The comparability of Tata
has been examined by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in St-Ericsson India
(P.) Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT - (2017) 79 taxmann.com 207 (Delhi-Trib.) wherein it
was ordered to be excluded as a comparable vis-à-vis ST-Ericsson India (P.)
Ltd., a captive software development provider by relying upon Sony Mobile
Communications International AB vs. Dy.DIT - (2016) 69 taxmann.com 404 (Delhi
- Trib.) for AY 2009-10, wherein it was ordered to be excluded on account of
acquisition and merger having total income of Rs.21535.75 crores and payment
of sale of equipment and software licence at Rs.668.25 crores. Tata has also
expended Rs.42.31 crores on its R&D and a highly risk bearing company and as
such, cannot be a suitable comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer which is a captive
software provider  16 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 being
remunerated on cost plus mark up basis for rendering services to its AE. So,
we order to exclude Tata from the final set of comparables.
THIRDWARE SOLUTIONS LTD. (THIRDWARE)
22\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Thirdware on ground of functional dis-
similarity on the ground that its segmental information is not available and
that company is also into sale of user licence for software application and
relied upon SunLife India Services Centre Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No.1489/Del/2014
for AY 2009- 10 & St. Ericsson India (P.) Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT in ITA
No.1672/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10.
23\. However, the ld. DR for the Revenue opposed the exclusion of Thirdware on
the ground that the taxpayer has not contested Thirdware either before the ld.
TPO or before ld. DRP.
24\. The coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in case of St. Ericsson India (P.)
Ltd. (supra) while examining the comparability of Thirdware ordered to exclude
Thirdware as a comparable vis-à-vis St. Ericsson from a routine captive
software development provider working on cost plus basis on the ground that
the substantial revenue of this company is from sales and operating sales of
17 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 licence, software services, export
form SEZ unit, export from STPI unit and revenue from subscription.
25\. All these facts are available in the annual report page 1537 of the
annual report compendium. So, in these circumstances, we are of the considered
view that let the TPO examined the comparability of the Thirdware in the light
of the decision of the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in St. Ericsson India
(P.) Ltd. (supra) as well as SunLife India Services Centre Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
WIPRO LIMITED (WIPRO)
26\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Wipro on grounds of functional
dissimilarity; being engaged in R&D activities having significant intangibles
and it is a giant company with differences in risk profile, nature of
services, expenditure on R&D etc. and relied upon Toluna India Pvt. Ltd. vs.
ACIT in ITA No.5645/Del/2011 and CIT vs. Agnity India Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
in ITA 1204/2011 (Hon'ble Delhi High Court). However, on the other hand, ld.
DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders passed by the AO/DRP.
27\. The taxpayer has sought the exclusion of Wipro before the ld. TPO/DRP who
have rejected the argument on the ground that the margin of the standalone
entity is higher than the consolidated  18 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 level. However, when we examine annual report of Wipro at page
1604 of the annual report compendium, Wipro is a leading global information
technology, or IT, services company, headquartered in Bangalore, India
providing a comprehensive range of IT services, software solutions and
research and development services in the areas of hardware and software design
to leading companies worldwide; using its development centers located in India
and around the world, quality processes and global resource pool to provide
cost effective IT solutions and deliver time-to-market and time-to-development
advantages to its clients. It also provides business process outsourcing, or
BPO, services and is a leader in the Indian IT market and focuses primarily on
meeting requirements for IT products of companies in India and the Middle East
region and have a notable presence in the markets for consumer products and
lighting and infrastructure engineering.
28\. Furthermore, in form B to the Director's Report, specific area in which
R&D is being carried out by the Wipro is as under :-
> "Wipro's R&D focus is to strengthen the portfolio of Centres of Excellence
> (CoE), Solution Acceleration and Software Engineering Tools & Methodologies.
> In financial year 2008-09, your Company incubated Applied Research group to
> investigate & analyze potential impact and business prospect of technologies
> which are in the early stage of adoption."
19 ITA No.825/Del/2014
> ITA No.419/Del/2014
> 29\. Moreover, Wipro is having huge intangibles as is evident from
> consolidated balance sheet schedule V, available at page 1659 of the annual
> report compendium, to the tune of Rs.28213 million.
30\. So keeping in view the functions, assets and risk profile of Wipro and
which is a fully risk bearing company, we are of the considered view that it
is not a suitable comparable vis-à-vis the taxpayer which is a routine captive
software development service provider working on cost plus mark up model of
business. Applying the ratio of the decision rendered by Hon'ble High Court in
Agnity India Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (supra), we are of the considered view
that Wipro being a giant company in the area of development of software
assuming full-fledged risk leading to higher profit, having huge intangibles
and R&D activities is not a suitable comparable to the taxpayer being a
captive software development service provider working on cost plus basis
having no R&D activities and is a risk insulated company. So, we order to
exclude Wipro from the final set of comparables. COMPANIES SOUGHT TO BE
INCLUDED QUINTEGRA SOLUTIONS (QUINTEGRA)
31\. Primarily, the ld. TPO has rejected Quintegra as a comparable on the
ground that this company fails the export filter  20 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 of 75%. The ld. TPO applied export filter of 75% of the total
income to select a company as comparable, as is evident from para 2.2(v) of
the TP order. However, the taxpayer has raised objection before ld. DRP that
Quintegra passes the export filter but the ld. DRP has not dealt with this
issue.
32\. Perusal of the submissions made by the taxpayer before ld. DRP are
available at pages 413 & 414 of the paper book II. However, perusal of the
profit & loss account, available at pages 1747 and 1750 of annual report
compendium and schedule forming part of the balance sheet to Quintegra shows
that Quintegra's export revenue is 95.06% and as such, passes the taxpayer's
export earning filter applied by the ld. TPO. So, ld. TPO is directed to
consider the Quintegra accordingly when he has not disputed the functional
profile of Quintegra and it has also not failed in other filters applied by
the ld. TPO.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENABLED SERVICES (ITES) SEGMENT
33\. Method and functional profile of the taxpayer is not in dispute. All the
international transactions carried out by the taxpayer during the year under
assessment are as per agreement dated 01.01.2007 which is continuing in nature
as were applicable  21 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 in AY 2008-09.
To benchmark international transactions, ld. TPO has selected 8 comparables
having average mean of 34.29% and proposed the adjustment of
Rs.17,63,54,842/-. The comparables finally selected by the ld. TPO are as
under :-
           S.No.    Company Name                          OP/TC%
              1.    Accentia Technologies Ltd.             52.52
              2.    Cosmic Global Ltd.                     50.70
              3.    Crossdomain Solution Pvt. Ltd.         25.63
              4.    Infosys BPO                            24.28
              5.    Eclerx Services Ltd.                   66.01
              6.    Coral Hub                              37.03
              7.    Aditya Birla Minac Worldwide Ltd       11.95
              8.    Fortune Infotech Ltd.                   6.27
                                  Average                  34.29
34\. Out of aforesaid 8 comparables for benchmarking the international
transactions qua ITES services, the taxpayer has sought exclusion of Accenture
Technologies Ltd., Cosmic Global Ltd. & Eclerx Services Ltd. The taxpayer has
also sought inclusion of Microland Ltd., R Systems & CG Vak Software & Exports
Ltd..
35\. Now, we would examine the comparability of the aforesaid companies vis-à-
vis the taxpayer one by one.  22 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 COMPANIES SOUGHT TO BE EXCLUDED BY THE TAXPAYER ACCENTURE
TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (ACCENTURE)
36\. The taxpayer sought to exclude Accenture on grounds of its functional
dis-similarity; that Accenture has undergone extra ordinary events during the
year under assessment and that its segmental data is not available in the
public domain and relied upon the taxpayer's own case in ITA No.1038/Del/2015
for AY 2010-11, Ameriprise India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT in ITA No.2010/Del/2014
for AY 2009-10, Capital IQ Information Systems vs. ACIT in ITA No.124/Hyd/2014
for AY 2009-10 and Macquarie Global Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA
No.6803/Del/2013 for AY 2009-10.
37\. However, on the other hand, ld. DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders
passed by the AO/DRP.
38\. The taxpayer raised objection for inclusion of Accenture before the ld.
TPO that it is functionally dis-similar and is into diversified business and
has acquired Oak Technologies Inc. and, therefore, fails the filter of some
peculiar circumstances but TPO has not discussed the objection of functional
dis-similarity and has retained Accenture as comparable on the ground that its
acquisition was completed by 31.03.2009 and it has no impact on the revenue
23 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 of the company during the year
under assessment. Ld. DRP retained Accenture by simply agreeing with ld. TPO
and without considering the objections raised by the taxpayer.
39\. Annual report of the Accenture, available at pages 605 to 692, shows that
Accenture is into the diversifying activities viz. Knowledge Process
Outsourcing (KPO), Legal Process Outsourcing, Data Process Outsourcing, high
end software services, whereas the taxpayer is a routine software ITES service
provider working on cost plus mark up and fully risk insulated company.
40\. Furthermore, Accenture has undergone extra ordinary event during the year
under assessment as it has acquired M/s. Oak Technologies Inc. with
consideration of US $ 9 million excluding during the cost of acquisition and
as on 31.03.2009, completed purchase of 96% of the outstanding equity shares
of M/s. Oak Technologies Inc. which has certainly impacted the profitability
of the taxpayer which is routine service provider. In view of the decision
rendered by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Rampgreen Solutions Pvt. Ltd. vs. CIT
\- 60 taxmann.com 355, KPO cannot be compared with routine BPO.
41\. Accenture has also been ordered to be excluded by the coordinate Bench of
the Tribunal in taxpayer's own case for AY  24 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 2010-11 in ITA No.1038/Del/2015 order dated 26.08.2016.
Consequently, we order to exclude Accenture from the final set of comparables
for benchmarking the international transactions. COSMIC GLOBAL LTD. (COSMIC)
42\. The taxpayer sought exclusion of Cosmic on the grounds inter alia that it
is functionally dis-similar; that under BPO segment, no segmental detail of
operating cost is available; that Cosmic's outsourcing expenditure is 56% of
the turnover and relied upon taxpayer's own case for AY 2008-09 and Mercer
Consulting India P. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA No.966/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10,
Capital IQ Information Systems vs. ACIT in ITA No.124/Hyd/2014 for AY 2009-10
and Macquarie Global Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA No.6803/Del/2013 for
AY 2009-10.
43\. However, on the other hand, ld. DR for the Revenue relied upon the orders
passed by the AO/DRP.
44\. Bare perusal of the balance sheet and profit & loss account of Cosmic,
available at pages 701 & 702 of the annual report compendium, shows that
financial results are available only on entity level. When we examine Schedule
VIII to the profit & loss account showing revenue from operation, it is clear
that income from medical transcription and consultancy which is akin to  25
ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 taxpayer is only Rs.9,90,737/- whereas
the major chunk of the business are from translation charges i.e.
Rs.6,99,35,756/- and income from BPO is Rs.27,76,090/-.
45\. Moreover, perusal of the P&L account further shows that the taxpayer has
outsourced 56% of its activities and its outsourcing expenses are 56% of its
revenue which makes its business model different from the taxpayer. So, we can
safely conclude that Cosmic is into translation business which is not
comparable to the taxpayer which is providing insurance claim processing
services to its AE under ITES segment.
46\. Cosmic was examined as a comparable in taxpayer's own case for AY 2008-09
and was ordered to be excluded being functionally dissimilar vide order dated
28.08.2014 passed in ITA No.6312/Del/2012. Cosmic was also ordered to be
excluded as a comparable by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in ITA
No.6803/Del/2013 vide order dated 22.01.2015 vi-a-vis Macquarie Global
Services Pvt. Ltd. which was also into providing ITES services to its AE on
ground of its functional dis-similarity by relying upon Mercer Consulting
(India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT (ITA No.966/Del/2014) on the ground that Cosmic
outsources its major activities. So, we ordered to exclude Cosmic from the
final set of comparables.
26 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 E-CLERX SERVICES (E-CLERX)
47\. The taxpayer sought to exclude E-Clerx for benchmarking its international
transaction on the grounds inter alia that it is functionally dis-similar;
that it has only one segment and has ordered to be excluded in taxpayer's own
case for AY 2008-09 and also relied upon Ameriprise India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT
in ITA No.2010/Del/2014 for AY 2009-10, Capital IQ Information Systems vs.
ACIT in ITA No.124/Hyd/2014 for AY 2009-10 and Macquarie Global Services Pvt.
Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA No.6803/Del/2013 for AY 2009-10.
48\. A perusal of pages 715 & 716 of the annual report compendium shows that
E-Clerx is Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) providing data analytics and
data process solutions to global enterprise clients, providing end to end
support through trade lifecycle including trade confirmation, settlements,
transaction, maintenance, risk analytic and reporting over the last year and
also providing unique blend of services, process reengineering and automation.
Furthermore, perusal of page 763 of annual report compendium shows that it is
having no segmental details rather company operates under single primary
segment i.e. data analytics and process outsourcing services. Ld. DR for the
27 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 Revenue contended that the taxpayer
is also a KPO providing KPO services under data analytics.
49\. However, we are of the considered view that E-Clerx is into providing
data analytics and customized process solution to diversifying global clients
and is also providing services to banking, manufacturing, retail, travel and
hospitality verticals. So, its functional profile is not matched with taxpayer
particularly when segmental detail is not available. So, the sole argument
advanced by ld. DR that the taxpayer is also a KPO, is not acceptable. E-Clerx
has been excluded as a comparable in taxpayer's own case for AY 2008-09 by the
coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in ITA No.6312/Del/2012 order dated
28.08.2014 and since then there is no change in the business profile of the
taxpayer till today.
50\. E-Clerx was also ordered to be excluded as a comparable in Macquaire
Global Services Pvt. Ltd. (supra) which was also into providing ITES services
to its AE on the ground that E-Clerx is a KPO and is providing end to end
support through trade life-cycle including trade confirmation including
settlement etc. and cannot be compared with Macquaire Global Services Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) which is also a captive unit rendering services to its AE without
any intangibles.
28 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014
51\. So, in view of the matter, we are of the considered view that E-Clerx is
not a suitable comparable vis-à-vis the taxpayer who is ordered to be
excluded.
COMPARABLES SOUGHT TO BE INCLUDED BY THE TAXPAYER MICROLAND LIMITED
(MICROLAND)
52\. Undisputedly, Microland was taken as a comparable first time by the
taxpayer before the ld. DRP. The ld. AR for the taxpayer submitted that
Microland passes all the filters applied by the TPO. The ld. DRP have not
given any finding on this comparable. In the given circumstances, when
Microland passes all the filters applied by the TPO, the TPO is directed to
examine its comparability for the purpose of benchmarking the international
transactions.
CG VAK SOFTWARE & EXPORTS LTD. & R. SYSTEMS (CG VAK) (R. SYSTEMS)
53\. The ld. TPO rejected CG Vak Software & Exports Ltd. as a comparable on
the ground that significant income of this company is from "software
development" and that income from BPO operation is only Rs.86,00,000/-. TPO
has applied segment while examining the comparable. Perusal of segmental
analysis,  29 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 available at page 879 of
the annual report compendium, shows that data is sufficient. In AY 2010-11, CG
Vak Software & Exports Ltd. was examined as a comparable in taxpayer's own
case and the issue was set aside to the TPO to reconsider in the light of the
decision rendered in Techbook International Pvt. Ltd. - ITA No.240/Del/2015
and Ameriprise India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT - ITA No.7014/Del/2014. In case, data
is sufficient, CG Vak Software & Exports Ltd. may be included in the final set
of comparables in the light of the decisions rendered by the coordinate Bench
of the Tribunal in Techbook International Pvt. Ltd. and Ameriprise India Pvt.
Ltd. (supra).
54\. R. Systems has been rejected by the TPO as a comparable on the ground
that it is having different ending year than March and as such, reliable
financial data is not available for 12 months period. Undisputedly, R. Systems
has different financial year vis-à-vis the taxpayer which has accounting year
from April to March but we are of the considered view that in case functional
similarities are there, any comparable cannot be excluded merely on account of
different accounting year. So, in case taxpayer provides reliable data to
examine the profitability, the ld. TPO may consider it for inclusion of the
same.
30 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 GROUNDS NO.1, 2 & 3
55\. Grounds No.1, 2 & 3 are general in nature more specifically elaborated in
the subsequent grounds, need no adjudication. GROUND NO.4
56\. The ld. TPO has treated foreign exchange gain/loss as non- operating
items in both the segments i.e. ITES services and Software Development
services while determining the arm's length price of the international
transactions, which are now under challenge before the Tribunal. The ld. DRP
by relying upon "Safe Harbour Rule" as per CBDT Notification dated 18.09.2013
upheld the findings returned by ld. TPO that foreign exchange gain/loss is a
non-operating item while determining the arm's length price of international
transaction.
57\. However, the ld. AR for the taxpayer contended that the taxpayer being a
captive service provider passes the foreign exchange loss/gain to the
respective AE on case to case basis without any mark up in order to make
suitable compensation of the margin earned by the taxpayer vis-à-vis
comparable companies.
58\. Undisputedly, the Revenue has not treated foreign exchange gain/loss as
non-operating item while operating arm's length price  31 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 of international transaction of the taxpayer in AYs
2008-09 and 2010-11.
59\. Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in case cited as Pr. CIT-02 VS. M/s. Cashedge
India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA 279/2016 order dated 04.05.2016 while upholding the
decision rendered by the Tribunal held that Safe Harbour Rule is not
applicable to AY 2008-09 as it came into force w.e.f. 18.09.2013 since the ld.
DRP has primarily relied upon Safe Harbour Rule while upholding the decision
of ld. DRP in treating the foreign exchange fluctuation gain/loss as non-
operating item, the findings are not sustainable.
60\. The coordinate Bench of the Tribunal decided the identical issue in case
of Westfalia Separator India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT in ITA No.4446/Del/2002 for AY
2003-04 by returning following findings :-
> "We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material on
> record. The forex gain or loss is the difference between the price at which
> an import or export transaction was recorded in the books of account on the
> basis of rate of foreign exchange then prevailing and the amount actually
> paid or received at the rate of foreign exchange prevailing at the time of
> actual payment or receipt. Since such forex loss or gain is a direct outcome
> of the purchase or sale transaction, it partakes of the same character as
> that of the transaction to which it relates. The Special Bench of the
> Tribunal in the case of ACIT vs. Prakash I. Shah (2008) 115 ITD 167 (Mum)
> (SB) has held that foreign exchange fluctuation gain is a part of export
> turnover. Though such decision was rendered in the context of section 80HHC,
> but the same logic applies generally as well. The essence of the matter is
> that any gain or loss arising out of change in foreign currency rate in  32
> ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 respect of transaction for import or
> export of goods is nothing, but inherent part of the price of import or the
> value of export. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd. VS.
> CIT 116 ITR 1 (SC) has held that : 'where profit or loss arises to an
> assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation ITA Nos.4446 &
> 4447/Del/2007 in the value of foreign currency held by it, on conversion
> into another currency, such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading
> profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue
> account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in
> the business'. When we read the ratio of the case of Sutlej Cotton
> (SC)(supra) in juxtaposition to that of the Special Bench in case of Prakash
> I Shah (supra), there remains no doubt that forex gain or loss from a
> trading transaction is not only an item of revenue nature, but is, in fact,
> a part of the price of import or value of export transaction, as the case
> may be. Operating expense is ordinarily an expense that a business incurs as
> a result of performing its normal business operations. As the business of
> 'Assembly' done by the assessee under this segment is not possible without
> purchases and forex gain is in relation to such purchase transactions, we
> have no hesitation in holding that it is an item of operating cost." 16 We
> find that the aforesaid basis that foreign exchange gain/loss should be
> treated as non- operating item is based on the notification of CBDT issued
> on 18.9.2018 on safe harbour. However, such a contention has been rejected
> in the aforesaid order of the coordinate bench wherein it was held as under:
> "4.8. The ld. AR relied on Rule 10T(j) to contend that loss arising on
> account of foreign currency fluctuations cannot be included in the operating
> expense. We are not persuaded to give any mileage to the ld. AR on this
> count for the simple reason that Rule 10T is a part of Safe harbor rules
> notified on 18.09.2013 which are not applicable to the assessment year under
> consideration."
61\. So, we are of the considered view that foreign exchange gain/loss cannot
be treated as non-operating items while calculating the margin of the taxpayer
as well as comparables. So, we direct to treat the foreign exchange gain/loss
as non-operating margin as non-operating items while benchmarking the  33 ITA
No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 international transactions. Consequently,
ground no.4 is determined in favour of the taxpayer.
GROUND NO.5
62\. Ld. AO/TPO/DRP have not made appropriate adjustment on account of working
capital differences between the taxpayer vis-à- vis comparable companies,
which are under challenge before the Tribunal. Ld. DRP denied appropriate
adjustment on account of difference in working capital employed on the ground
that the onus is on the taxpayer to demonstrate the reason and calculation of
working capital adjustment and the ld. TPO has rightly denied the same to the
taxpayer.
63\. Identical issue has come up before the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal
in taxpayer's own case for AY 2008-09, operative part of which is reproduced
as under for ready perusal :-
> "13.1. Now, we espouse the next contention raised by the ld. AR about the
> denial of working capital adjustment, which was claimed before the TPO. The
> DRP echoed the TPO's order on this score by noticing that the assessee took
> the average of the amount of working capital deployed by the comparables on
> the first and last day of accounting period to compute the working capital
> adjustment and there were no means to ascertain the working capital deployed
> by the comparables throughout the year on daily basis. The assessee is
> aggrieved.
> 13.2. Having heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material
> on record, it is manifest that the working capital adjustment is required
> with reference to stock, trade receivable and trade payables. By carrying
> the high trade receivables, a company allows its customers a relatively
> longer  34 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 period to pay their
> accounts, which results into higher interest cost and lower profit. By
> carrying high trade payables, a company benefits from a relatively longer
> period available to it for paying back its suppliers, which results into its
> lower interest cost and higher profit. Similarly, high stock means blockage
> of funds and the resultant lower profit. These three ingredients directly

64\. Following the decision rendered by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal,
we are of the considered view that the taxpayer is entitled for working
capital adjustment to be on the same page with the comparables. So, the
taxpayer is entitled for working capital adjustment, the quantum of which is
to be checked by the ld. TPO who has to proceed on the lines of the decision
rendered by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in taxpayer's own case for AY
2008-09, Consequently, Ground No.5 is determined in favour of the taxpayer.

66\. The AO in the draft order, available at pages 140 to 147, denied the
deduction of Rs.125,71,932/- and Rs.22,85,957/- claimed u/s 10A of the Act
being the interest on FDR and misc. income respectively on the ground that the
same is not related to exports. Ld. DRP also upheld the findings of the AO by
observing that the interest income cannot be termed as profit derived from an
undertaking and has also not followed the decision rendered by the coordinate
Bench in AY 2008-09 on identical issue.
67\. Undisputedly, identical issue has come up before the Tribunal in
taxpayer's own case for AY 2010-11 and has been decided in favour of the
taxpayer by relying upon the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court

36 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 "9. The question as to what can constitute as profits and
gains derived by a 100% EOU from the export of articles and computer software
came for consideration before the Karnataka High Court in CIT v. Motorola
India Electronics (P.) Ltd. [2014] 46 taxmann.com 167/225 Taxman 11 (Mag.).
The said appeal before the Karnataka High Court was by the Revenue challenging
an order passed by the ITAT which held that the interest payable on FDRs was
part of the profits of the business of the undertaking and therefore
includible in the income eligible for deduction Sections 10A and 10B of the
Act. There the Assessee had earned interest on the deposits lying in the EEFC
account as well as interest earned on inter-corporate loans given to sister
concerns out of the funds of the undertaking. There was a restriction on the
Assessee in that case from making pre- payment of its external commercial
borrowings ('ECB'). It could repay only to the extent of 10% of the
outstanding loan in a year. This made the Assessee temporarily park the
balance funds as deposits or with various sister concerns as inter corporate
deposits until the date of repayment. The Assessee contended that the interest
derived from the business of the industrial undertaking was eligible for
exemption within the meaning of Section 10B and applied the formula under
Section 10B(4) of the Act for determining the profits from exports. The
Assessee's contention that the expression "profits of the business of the
undertaking" in Section 10B(4) was wider than the expression "profits and
gains derived by" the Assessee from a 100% EOU occurring in Section 10B(1) was
accepted by the ITAT. The ITAT noticed that unlike Section 80HHC, where there
was an express exclusion of the interest earned from the 'profits of business
of undertaking', there was no similar provision as far as Sections 10A and 10B
were concerned.
10\. In Motorola India Electronics (P.) Ltd. (supra) reference was made to the
decision of the Supreme Court in Pandian Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT [2003] 262 ITR
278/129 Taxman 539 which dealt with Section 80HH and Liberty India v. CIT
[2009] 317 ITR 218/183 Taxman 349 (SC), which interpreted Section 801B of the
Act. Reference was also made to the decision of CIT v. Sterling Foods [1999]
237 ITR 579/104 Taxman 204 (SC), which interpreted Section 80HH and the
decision of the Madras High Court in CIT v. Menon Impex (P.) Ltd. [2003] 259
ITR 403/128 Taxman 11 which interpreted Section 10A of the Act. The Karnataka
High Court in Motorola India Electronics (P.) Ltd. (supra), after noticing the
above decisions, held that "it is clear that, what is exempted is not merely
the profits and gains from the export of articles but also the income from the
business of the undertaking". Specific to the question of interest earned by
the EOU on the FDRs placed by it and interest earned from the loans given to
sister concerns, it was held that although it did not partake the character of
profit and gains from the sale of an  37 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 article "it is income which is derived from the consideration
realized by export of articles."
11\. The decision of the Karnataka High Court in Motorola India Electronics
(P.) Ltd. (supra) was followed by this Court in its decision in CIT v. Hritnik
Exports (P.) Ltd. (decision dated 13th November 2014 in ITA Nos. 219 and 239
of 2014). This Court also referred to its earlier decision dated 1st September
2014 in ITA No. 438 of 2014 (CIT v. XLNC Fashions). While declining to frame a
question of law in the Revenue's appeal, this Court inHritnik Exports (P.)
Ltd. (supra) quoted with approval the observations of the Special Bench of the
ITAT in Maral Overseas Ltd. v. Addl. CIT [2012] 136 ITD 177/20 taxmann.com 346
(Indore) on the interpretation of Section 10B(4) of the Act as under:
'79. Thus, sub-section (4) of section 10B stipulated that deduction under that
section shall be computed by apportioning the profits of the business of the
undertaking in the ratio of turnover to the total turnover. Thus, not-
withstanding the fact that sub-section (1) of section 10B refers the profits
and gains as are derived by a 100% EOU, yet the manner of determining such
eligible profits has been statutorily defined in sub-section (4) of section
10B of the Act. As per the formula stated above, the entire profits of the
business are to be taken which are multiplied by the ratio of the export
turnover to the total turnover of the business. Sub-section (4) does not
require an assessee to establish a direct nexus with the business of the
undertaking and once an income forms part of the business of the undertaking,
the same would be included in the profits of the business of the undertaking.
Thus, once an income forms part of the business of the eligible undertaking,
there is no further mandate in the provisions of section 10B to exclude the
same from the eligible profits. The mode of determining the eligible deduction
u/s 10B is similar to the provisions of section 80HHC inasmuch as both the
sections mandates determination of eligible profits as per the formula
contained therein. The only difference is that section 80HHC contains a
further mandate in terms of Explanation (baa) for exclusion of certain income
from the "profits of the business" which is, however, conspicuous by its
absence in section 10B. On the basis of the aforesaid distinction, sub-section
(4) of section 10A/10B of the Act is a complete code providing the mechanism
for computing the "profits of the business" eligible for deduction u/s 10B of
the Act. Once an income forms part of the business of the income of the
eligible undertaking of the assessee, the same cannot be excluded from the
eligible profits for the purpose of computing deduction u/s 10B of the Act. As
per the computation made by the Assessing Officer himself, there is no dispute
that both these incomes have been treated by the Assessing Officer as business
income. The CBDT Circular No. 564 dated 5th July,  38 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 1990 reported in 184 ITR (St.) 137 explained the scope and
ambit of section 80HHC and the mode of determination of profits derived by an
assessee from the export of goods. I.T.A.T., Special Bench in the case of
International Research Park Laboratories v. ACIT, 212 ITR (AT) 1, after
following the aforesaid Circular, held that straight jacket formula given in
sub-section (3) has to be followed to determine the eligible deduction. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case ofP.R. Prabhakar; 284 ITR 584 had approved
the principle laid down in the Special Bench decision in International
Research Park Laboratories v.ACIT (supra). In the assessee's own case the
I.T.A.T. in the preceding years, after considering the decision in the case of
Liberty India held that provisions of section 10B are different from the
provisions of section 80IA wherein no formula has been laid down for computing
the eligible business profit.'
12\. Recently, in a decision dated 6th October 2015 in ITA NO. 392 of 2015
(Principal CIT v. Universal Precision Screws), this Court had occasion to
again consider whether interest earned on fixed deposits kept by an Assessee
which was eligible under Section 10B of the Act, as a condition for
utilization of letter of credit and bank guarantee limits, would qualify for
deduction. That question was decided in favour of the Assessee and against the
Revenue. The Court held as under:
'9. On the question of interest on the FDRs, the ITAT has referred to Section
10B(4) which states that for the purposes of Section 10B(1), the profits
derived from export of articles or things or computer software "shall be the
amount which bears to the profits of the business of the undertaking", the
same proportion as the export turnover in respect of such articles or things
or computer software bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by
the undertaking.' As noted by this Court in CIT v. Hritnik Exports Pvt. Ltd.
(decision dated 13th November, 2014 in ITA No. 219 & 239 of 2014), Section
10B(4) mandates the application of the formula for determining the profits
derived from exports for the purposes of Section 10B(1). In other words, the
formula would read thus:
Profits derived from export = Profits of the business of the undertaking 9A.
In terms of the above formula, the question that would arise is whether the
interest on the FDRs could form part of the 'profits of the business of the
undertaking'. The attention of the Court has been drawn to the decision of the
Karnataka High Court in CIT v. Motorola India Electronics Pvt. Ltd. (2014) 46
Taxmann.com 167 (Kar.) which held that there was a direct nexus between the
interest received from the FDRs created by a similarly placed Assessee from
the amounts borrowed by it. The  39 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014
High Court approved the order of the ITAT in that case which held that the
entire profits of the business of the undertaking should be taken into
consideration while computing the eligible deduction under Section 10B of the
Act by ITA 392/2015 applying the mandatory formula.
10\. In the present case, the Assessee has stated that the interest on FDRs
was received on "margin kept in the bank for utilization of letter of credit
and bank guarantee limits". In those circumstances, the decision of the ITAT
that such interest bears the requisite characteristic of business income and
has nexus to the business activities of the Assessee cannot be faulted. In
other words, interest earned on the FDRs would form part of the "profits of
the business of the undertaking" for the purposes of computation of the
profits derived from export by applying formula under Section 10B(4) of the
Act.'
13\. Mr. Ashok Manchanda, learned Senior standing counsel for the Revenue,
urged that none of the earlier decisions of the High Courts have considered
the effect of Sections 80I, 801A and 801B of the Act which occur in Chapter
VIA of the Act. He referred in particular to Section 80A(4) of the Act, which
reads as under:
'4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 10A or
section 10AA or section 10B or section 10BA or in any provisions of this
Chapter under the heading "C--Deductions in respect of certain incomes",
where, in the case of an assessee, any amount of profits and gains of an
undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business is claimed and allowed
as a deduction under any of those provisions for any assessment year,
deduction in respect of, and to the extent of, such profits and gains shall
not be allowed under any other provisions of this Act for such assessment year
and shall in no case exceed the profits and gains of such undertaking or unit
or enterprise or eligible business, as the case may be.'
14\. Mr. Manchanda's attempt was to show that Section 80A(4), which inter alia
stated that any deduction allowable under Section 10B cannot in any case
"exceed the profits and gains of such undertaking or unit or enterprise or
eligible business, as the case may be" made it clear that a unit seeking
deduction under Section 10B would be eligible to do so only insofar as such
income was directly attributable to the business of export. Any income that
might be merely incidental to the business of the undertaking, not directly
related to the activity of export, would not be eligible for such deduction.
He also took the Court again through the decision of the Supreme Court in
Liberty India (supra) and submitted that the earlier decisions of this Court
in Hritnik Exports (P.) Ltd. (supra) and Universal Precision Screws  40 ITA
No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 (supra) might require to be reconsidered.
When a question was posed to him as to whether the Revenue had challenge the
aforementioned decisions of this Court, and of the ITAT in the present case to
the extent it has allowed the plea of the Assessee as regards 'deemed export
drawback', Mr. Manchanda stated that the Revenue ought to have challenged the
above decisions as well as the impugned order of the ITAT in the present case
and perhaps he would advise it to do so hereafter. He has also handed over a
written note of submissions, reiterating the above submissions.
15\. In the considered view of the Court, the submissions made on behalf of
the Revenue proceed on the basic misconception regarding the true purport of
the provisions of Chapter VIA of the Act and on an incorrect understanding of
Section 80A(4) of the Act. The opening words of Section 80A(4) read
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 10A or section
10AA or section 10B or section 10BA or in any provisions of this Chapter . . .
. . ". What is sought to be underscored, therefore, is that Section 80A, and
the other provisions in Chapter VIA, are independent of Sections 10A and 10B
of the Act. It appears that the object of Section 80A(4) was to ensure that a
unit which has availed of the benefit under Section 10B will not be allowed to
further claim relief under Section 80IA or 80IB read with Section 80A(4). The
intention does not appear to be to deny relief under Section 10B(1) read with
Section 10B(4) or to whittle down the ambit of those provisions as is sought
to be suggested by Mr. Manchanda. Also, he is not right in contending that the
decisions of the High Courts referred to above have not noticed the decision
of the Supreme Court in Liberty India. The Karnataka High Court in Motorola
India Electronics (P.) Ltd. (supra) makes a reference to the said decision.
That decision of the Karnataka High Court has been cited with approval by this
Court in Hritnik Exports (P.) Ltd. (supra) and Universal Precision Screws
(supra). In Hritnik Exports (P.) Ltd. (supra) the Court quoted with approval
the observations of the Special Bench of the ITAT in Maral Overseas Ltd.
(supra) that "Section 10A/10B of the Act is a complete code providing the
mechanism for computing the 'profits of the business' eligible for deduction
u/s 10B of the Act. Once an income forms part of the business of the income of
the eligible undertaking of the assessee, the same cannot be excluded from the
eligible profits for the purpose of computing deduction u/s 10B of the Act."
16\. This then brings us to the questions framed for consideration in the
present case and the decision of the ITAT in not accepting the Assessee's plea
in regard to 'customer claims' 'freight subsidy' and 'interest on fixed
deposit receipts' even while it  41 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014
accepted the Assessee's case as regards 'deemed export drawback'.
17\. The contention of the Assessee as regards customer claims was that it had
received the claim of Rs. 28,27,224 from a customer for cancelling the export
order. Later on the cancelled order was completed and goods were exported to
another customer. The sum received as claim from the customer was nonseverable
from the income of the business of the undertaking. The Court fails to
appreciate as to how the ITAT could have held that this transaction did not
arise from the business of the export of goods. Even as regards freight
subsidy, the Assessee's contention was that it had received the subsidy in
respect of the business carried on and the said subsidy was part of the profit
of the business of the undertaking. If the ITAT was prepared to consider the
deemed export draw back as eligible for deduction then there was no
justification for excluding the freight subsidy. Even as regards the interest
on FDR, the Court has been shown a note of the balance sheet of the Assessee
[which was placed before the AO] which clearly states that "fixed deposit
receipts (including accrued interest) valuing Rs. 15,05,875 are under lien
with Bank of India for facilitating the letter of credit and bank guarantee
facilities." In terms of the ratio of the decisions of this Court both in
Hritnik Exports (P.) Ltd. (supra) and Universal Precision Screws (supra), the
interest earned on such FDR ought to qualify for deduction under Section 10B
of the Act."
68\. So, following the findings returned by the coordinate Bench of the
Tribunal in taxpayer's own case for AY 2010-11 based on the decision of
Hon'ble High Court in Riviera Home Furnishing (supra), we are of the
considered view that the taxpayer is entitled for deduction u/s 10A on the
interest earned on fixed deposit receipts to the tune of Rs.125,71,932/- and
Rs.22,85,957/-.
69\. Similar view as to allowing the deduction u/s 10A of the Act on excess
provision returned back amounting to Rs.7,42,769/- has been expressed by the
coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in Birlasoft (India) Ltd. vs. DCIT 44 SOT 664
(Delhi). Following  42 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 the decision
rendered by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal, we are of the considered
view that notice pay recoveries from the employees is also part of the
business profit of the taxpayer on which the taxpayer is also eligible for
deduction u/s 10A of the Act. Consequently, grounds no.11 & 11.1 are also
determined in favour of the taxpayer.
GROUND NO.12
70\. The AO has not given credit of tax deducted at source of Rs.58,922/- to
the taxpayer. AO is directed to provide the credit to the taxpayer qua the tax
deducted at source after due verification. GROUND NO.13
71\. The AO has also not given credit of advance tax of RS.27,50,000/-
deposited by the taxpayer during the year under assessment. The taxpayer is
entitled for credit of advance tax subject to verification by the AO. So, the
AO is directed to proceed accordingly.
GROUND NO.14
72\. AO has also not granted set off of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit of
Rs.216,54,947/- brought forward during the year under assessment u/s 115JAA of
the Act. When it is not in dispute that the taxpayer has claimed the credit of
Rs.216,54,947/- being  43 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 brought
forward figure, the taxpayer is entitled for set off of MAT credit of the
same. So, the AO is directed to proceed accordingly after due verification.
GROUND NO.15 & 15.1
73\. Grounds No.15 & 15.1 qua levy of interest u/s 234B and 234C of the Act
need no specific finding being consequential in nature.
REVENUE'S APPEAL (ITA NO.419/DEL/2014) GRO8UND NO.i
74\. Grounds No.i is general in nature and need no adjudication being more
specifically elaborated in the subsequent grounds. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
SERVCIES SEGMENT GROUND NO.ii READ WITH GROUND NOS.iv & v
75\. The Revenue has challenged the order passed by ld. DRP to the extent of
excluding M/s. Aricent Tech, M/s. Bodhtree Consulting and CAT Technologies for
benchmarking the international transactions qua services provided by the
taxpayer to its AE in software development services segment. We would examine
the comparability of the aforesaid 3 comparables vis-à-vis the taxpayer one by
one.
44 ITA No.825/Del/2014
ITA No.419/Del/2014 ARICENT TECH (ARICENT)
76\. Perusal of para 3.1 of the TP order apparently shows that Aricent was
rejected by the TPO itself on ground of Related Party Transactions (RPT) which
are to the tune of 33.61%, but somehow again Aricent find place in final set
of comparables for benchmarking the international transactions. This factual
position has not been controverted by the ld. Senior DR. So, we are of the
considered view that there is no scope for further deliberations on the
comparability of Aricent as it fails RPT filter applied by the TPO himself.
So, ld. DRP has rightly rejected Aricent as a comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer.
BODHTREE CONSULTING (BODHTREE)
77\. Before the ld. TPO, the taxpayer sought to reject Bodhtree on the grounds
inter alia that it has only ONE segment i.e. software development in FY
2006-07 being engaged in providing open and end to end web solutions, software
consultancy, design and development of solutions, using the latest
technologies and besides specialized IT and data management services, the
company had developed and spun off its strategic business units in
e-publishing (e-paper solution), E-Learning (Web based assessment services )
and Mobile Classified space (mobile search and classified  45 ITA
No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 advertising platform for the used car
industry in Malaysia) into Pressmart Media Limited, Learn Smart (India) Pvt.
Ltd. and Trylah SDN Bhd respectively. It is also mentioned that the company
has software solutions of its own (Hygia 2.3 - Enterprise Data Quality
Solution, Busin Essence 4.0 - Business Intelligence Dashboard Solution,
DigiDoc - Document Management framework) and Sevices (Web Services and
Customized IT Professional Services.
78\. However, TPO retained Bodhtree as a comparable on the ground that the
company has shown fixed assets in the form of computer software of
Rs.96,03,610/- only which is insignificant and there is no capitalized
expenditure on software development on software products and as such, it does
not have any significant product business.
79\. However, the ld. DRP excluded Bodhtree on the ground of abnormal results
during this year by tabulating the margin of this company of earlier and
subsequent years as under :- Company 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10
2010-11 Name OP/TC Margin Bodhtree 14.66% 33.20% 20.86% 64.04% 34.39% -29.65%
Consulting Limited
80\. The ld. DR for the Revenue challenging the impugned order passed by ld.
DRP by relying upon ChrysCapital Investment  46 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA
No.419/Del/2014 Advisors (India)_(P.) Ltd. vs. DCIT (2015) 56 taxmann.com 417
(Delhi) contended that functionally similar comparables cannot be excluded
only on the ground of super normal profit.
81\. However, ld. AR for the taxpayer relied upon decisions of the coordinate
Bench of the Tribunal in Ciena India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No.1453/Del/2014 order
dated 24.04.2015 and Infinera India Pvt. Ltd. in ITA(TA) A.No.1008 (BNG.)/2014
order dated 30.06.2016 wherein Bodhtree has been ordered to be excluded on the
basis of fluctuating profit margin.
82\. No doubt, high or low profit margin of the company is not a ground for
treating it as uncomparable but in case high or low profit is due to abnormal
circumstances then certainly fluctuating profit margin is a ground to reject
the company as a suitable comparable. Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in
Ciena India Pvt. Ltd. for AY 2009-10 (supra) examined the issue at length and
treated fluctuating profit margin of Bodhtree as a ground for rejecting as a
comparable by returning following findings :-
> "9.6. Coming back to the facts of the instant case, we find from Schedule 12

83\. Perusal of annual report, available at page 1798 of the paper book Vol.V,
also goes to prove that the company is engaged in both software solution and
software services. Moreover, as discussed by the coordinate Bench of the
Tribunal in Ciena India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), "When the position of accounts of
Bodhtree is  48 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 such that it does not
properly match expenses with revenue, it loses its credibility for making a
logical comparison with a company that accounts for expenses matching with the
revenue", it cannot be a suitable comparable. So ld. DRP has rightly excluded
Bodhtree as unsuitable comparable vis-à-vis taxpayer. CAT TECHNOLOGY
84\. Before the ld. TPO, taxpayer has sought exclusion of CAT Technology on
ground of functional dis-similarity because the company is exclusively in the
business of Medical Transcription, Training, Software Development and
Consulting Services. Perusal of annual report, available at page 1871, also
shows that CAT Technology is engaged in job portal services.
85\. Ld. DR contended that the CAT Technology is only into software
development as discussed by the TPO. However, as per data available in the
annual report at page 1871, it is categorically mentioned that during the year
under assessment, the company launched job portal viz. Logtalent.com which was
instant success with job aspirants. Encouraged with success of this portal
company proposed to launch 3 to 4 portal during the current financial year in
the different fields. So, in the given circumstances, contention  49 ITA
No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014 made by ld. Senior DR is misplaced and ld.
DRP has rightly excluded CAT Technology from the final set of comparables.
ITES SEGMENT GROUND NO.iii READ WITH GROUNDS NO.iv & v
86\. The Revenue has challenged the exclusion of Coral Hub by ld. DRP on the
ground that the same has been excluded without any valid reason. Before the
ld. TPO, the taxpayer has sought exclusion of Coral on ground of functional
dis-similarity and low employee cost ratio. Both these objections have been
overruled by the ld. TPO.
87\. However, the ld. DRP rejected Coral Hub as a comparable on ground of its
outsourcing activities. Perusal of annual report, available at page 945 (P&L
account for the year ending June, 2010), shows that Coral has outsourced its
activities to the extent of 90% and its operating expenses on account of data
entry charges, vendor payment and expenses on conversion of books into POD
titles is to the tune of about Rs.56 crores.
88\. Coral Hub has been ordered to be excluded on ground of functional dis-
similarity by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in taxpayer's own case for
AY 2008-09. The relevant findings  50 ITA No.825/Del/2014 ITA No.419/Del/2014
returned by the coordinate Bench of the Tribunal are reproduced as under :-
> "12.2. Having heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material
> on record, we find from the Annual report of this company that it is mainly
> engaged in e-publishing business. It has more than 10,000 classic books to
> its credit which are also converted into large font titles for visually
> challenged. Apart from e-publishing, this company is also engaged in
> Documents scanning & Indexing. It can be seen from the financial results of
> this company that both the segments viz., e-publishing and Documents
> scanning etc. have been combined and there are no separate financial results
> in respect of Documents scanning work, which may be comparable with the
> assessee to some extent. As the assessee is not engaged in any e-publishing
> business and the financials given by this company are on consolidated basis,
> we direct to exclude this company from the list of comparables. The assessee
> succeeds."
89\. So, keeping in view the functional dis-similarity of Coral Hub (Vishal
Informatics) vis-à-vis the taxpayer, the ld. DRP has rightly excluded the
Coral from the final set of comparables GROUNDS NO.vi & vii
90\. Grounds No.vi & vii are general in nature, hence need no specific
adjudication.
91\. Resultantly, the appeal of the taxpayer stands allowed for statistical
purposes and the appeal of the Revenue is dismissed. Order pronounced in open
court on this 9th day of February, 2018.
