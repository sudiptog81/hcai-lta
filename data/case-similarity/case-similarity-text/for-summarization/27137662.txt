PER CHANDRA POOJARI, AM:
These are ten appeals both by the assessee as well as by the Revenue. I.T.A.
Nos. 727 to 730/Hyd/2010 are by the Revenue directed against the common order
of the CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad dated 19.03.2010 for assessment years 2002-03 to
2005-06. I.T.A. Nos. 325 to 327/Hyd/2011 by the Revenue and I.T.A. No. 230 to
232/Hyd/2011 by the assessee are cross appeals for assessment years 2006-07 to
2008-09 directed against the  2 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad
House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== common order of the CIT(A)-I, Hyderabad dated
30.12.2010. Since common issues are involved, all these appeals are clubbed
together, heard together and are being disposed of by this common order, for
the sake of convenience.
2\. Brief facts of the case are that a search and seizure operation was
carried out on 12-12-2007 in the business premises' of the assessee company.
Consequent to the search, notices u/s. 153A of the I.T. Act were issued in
response to which the assessee company filed return of income for the
assessment years 2002-03 to 2005-06 declaring income as below:
                         A.Y.               Returned income (Rs.)
                       2002-03                   1,71,788
                       2003-04                   2,80,660
                       2004-05                   4,40,727
                       2005-06                   7,96,358
3\. Apparently during the course of search, a bundle of loose sheets were
found and seized and placed as Annexure A/HHPL/PO-3/2 which is nothing but
daily reports of sales from various outlets of the assessee's company. Similar
daily sales reports were found in some another annexures mentioned by the
Assessing Officer in the assessment order for the A.Y. 2008-09. The
documentary evidences showed suppression of sales found for the months of
January 2006, February 2006, May 2007, July 2007, August 2007 and September
2007 pertaining to assessment years 2006-07 and 2008-09. Based on these
documentary evidences, the Assessing Officer proposed to quantify suppression
of sales for the earlier assessment years 2002-03 to 2005-06 and issued a show
cause notice. The assessee, however, objected to the proposal of the Assessing
Officer. After considering the explanation of the assessee, the Assessing
Officer quantified the undisclosed income on suppressed turnover for the
assessment years 2002-03 to 2005-06 as under:
3 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
                                                    ========================
                       A.Y.         Estimated Income (Rs.)
                     2002-03               12,76,550
                     2003-04               51,32,892
                     2004-05               68,82,448
                     2005-06             1,20,55,580
> 4\. Apart from the estimation of undisclosed income based on suppressed
> turnover as above, the Assessing Officer also disallowed certain expenses
> debited to the Profit and Loss A/c. as below:
                       A.Y.         Disallowed expenditure
                                              (Rs.)
                     2002-03                3,94,175
                     2003-04               10,65,310
                     2004-05               14,48,430
                     2005-06               28,88,470
> 5\. The above disallowances were basically on account of production
> expenditure and fringe benefits and administrative expenditure. Being
> aggrieved against the above mentioned disallowances and computation of
> income, the assessee went in appeal before the CIT(A) wherein the assessee
> raised the following grounds:
> 1\. The Learned AO is not justified in estimating suppression of turnover
> purely on the basis of assumptions and presumptions and without any material
> on record.
> 2\. Without prejudice to above ground the percentage of income estimated by
> the AO on the estimated suppressed turnover is arbitrary, too high and
> unjustified considering the nature of the business of the assessee
> 3\. The Ld. AD is not justified in making the addition of Rs. 12,76,550, Rs.
> 51,32,892, Rs. 68,82,448 and Rs. l,20,55,580 for assessment years 2002-03 to
> 2005-06 respectively, being the estimated income on estimated suppressed
> turnover.
4 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
> M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ========================
> 4\. The Ld. AO is not justified in making general estimated disallowances on
> the expenditure claimed in the regular returns without any reference to
> seized material.
> 5\. The Ld. AO is not justified in making huge disallowances in the regular
> expenditure ignoring the fact that the assessee has made most of the
> payments through banking channels and the other expenditure being supported
> by appropriate statutory payments like PF, ESI and TDS.
> 6\. In course of the first appellate proceedings, the AR of the assessee
> submitted that estimation of turnover and further estimating the net income
> thereon for the A.Y. 2002-03 to 2005-
06, is bad in law. According to the AR the AO wrongly estimated the suppressed
turnover for the aforementioned four assessment years though the data was
available for the assessment years 2006-07 and 2008-09 only that too for a
period of 6 months. The AO himself admitted at page No. 12 of the assessment
order for the A.Y. 2008-09 that the investigation officials could find the
evidence in support of suppressed turnover for only 6 months and there is no
other indication to suggest that the assessee was involved in a systematic
suppression of turnover even in the earlier years. It was submitted that
simply based on the evidence for 6 months, estimating the alleged suppressed
turnover for the entire block period is wholly unjustified and uncalled for.
Even in the statement ujs. 132(4), there is no reference to any suppression of
turnover for this period. Hence the estimation of suppression of turnover for
this period and consequently estimation of net income is unjustified. The
assessee's counsel relied on the following decisions:
> 1\. ACIT Vs. Rasna Industries (31 SOT 26) ITAT, Jodhpur.
> 2\. DCIT Vs. Royal Marawar Tobacco Products (29 SOT 53), !TAT, Ahmadabad.
5 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
> M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ========================
7\. It was submitted that in the absence of any material indicating any
suppressed sales, the AO is not justified in making addition for the said year
on the basis of material seized relating to another year.
8\. As regards disallowance of expenditure claimed in the regular return, the
assessee submitted that the AO failed to appreciate the fact that the assessee
was in the business of preparation of food items which involves purchases of
vegetables, fire wood, mutton, fish etc from unorganised sectors. The
documentary evidences in support of the purchases of these items may not be up
to the standard expected by the department; however the fact remains that the
books of account were produced before the AO in support of the genuineness of
expenditure incurred and in fact the assessee filed data for one of the
assessment years 2007-08 segregating the payment made through banking channels
and payments made in cash under each head. The payments also included certain
statutory payments like PF and ESI. The AO failed to appreciate that the books
of account are subjected to audit u/s. 44AB of the Act. As regards specific
issue of estimation of disallowance, the assessee submitted that all the
assessments for the period under appeal were completed u/s. 143(3) rws 153A
even though there was no reference to any seized material and hence the
disallowances so made are uncalled for and legally not correct. The assessee
relied on the decision of !TAT, Kolkata Bench in the case of LMJ International
Ltd Vs. DCIT (119 TTJ 214), wherein it was held that items for regular
assessments would not be disturbed and items like income and expenditure which
had been disclosed to the revenue were outside the purview of assessment of
such cases. It was also submitted that since no material indicating any
suppressed sale had been found during the course of search and since there was
no defect in the books of account, the AO was not justified in making addition
for the  6 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== assessment years 2000-01 to 2003-04 based on the
materials relating to A.Y. 2004-05. According to the AR, the Assessing Officer
shall confine to the determination of undisclosed income only to the
incriminating material unearthed during the search and cannot include items
which are disclosed in the original assessment proceedings.
9\. The learned CIT(A) after considering the arguments of the assessee's
counsel observed that during the course of search and seizure operation,
materials were found only in respect of six months that too falling in the
financial year 2005-06 and 2007- 08 relevant to the assessment years 2006-07
and 2008-09 and observed that the AO was not justified in estimating the
suppressed turnover for the earlier years when the assessee had objected to
the same and when there was no voluntary admission in this - regard. For this
purpose reliance was placed on the decision of ITAT Ahmedabad in the case of
DCIT Vs. Royal Marawar Tobacco Products (16 DTR 129). In the said case the
Hon'ble ITAT observed as under:
> It was undisputed that during the course of search and seizure proceedings
> no evidence and/or material, indicating any suppressed sales made by the
> assessee during the assessment years 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002- 03 and 2003-04,
> was found. No material was also found to indicate that there was any
> suppressed production in the aforesaid assessment years. The Assessing
> Officer on finding that material was seized relating to the assessment year
> 2004-05 in the above search, indicating suppressed production and sales
> existed in the assessment year 2004-05, presumed that there might have been
> suppressed production and sales in the assessment years 2001-02 to 2003-04
> also. Hence, he took the consumption of electricity as basis and on further
> assumption and presumption arrived at some suppressed production and sales
> for the said assessment years. It was not in dispute that no defect in the
> books of account maintained for the aforesaid years was found. In absence of
> any material  7 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt.
> Ltd.
> ======================== being found during the search, relevant to the
> aforesaid assessment years, the Commissioner (Appeals) was justified in
> deleting the addition made for these years, only on the basis of assumption
> and surmises."
10\. According to the CIT(A) the additions made by the AO without any specific
reference to seized material cannot be held to be legally sustainable and he
further observed that additions cannot be made in an assessment made u/s.
153A/153C if there is no incriminating material in respect of the proposed
additions. Since in the appeals under consideration there was no specific
incriminating material indicating suppression of sales in the financial years
2001-02 to -2004-05 relevant to the assessment years 2002-03 to 2005-06 in his
view the estimation of suppressed turnover based on material found for
A.Y.2006-07 and 2008-09 is not justified .Consequently the estimated income
computed by the AO based on the said estimated turnover is deleted.
11\. As regards the other disallowances of expenditure debited to P&L account
the same is also deleted by CIT(A) placing reliance on the order of the
Tribunal Kolkata Bench in the case of LMJ international Ltd. (cited supra) and
the order of the Tribunal Hyderabad Bench in the case of ACIT/DCIT, Central
Circle-5 Vs. Platina Properties Projects Ltd in ITA No. 1622, 1623, 573 to
576/Hyd/2008 and in the case of Yelamanchili Finance and Trading Pvt. Ltd Vs.
ACIT, Central Circle 5 in ITA No. 745/HYD/2008 wherein held as under:
> " .... the present assessment is made u/s. 143(3) r.w.s. 153A r.w.s. 153C of
> the Act. The second proviso to sub section 1 to section 153A provides that
> if assessment for any of the assessment year falling within in a period 6
> years mentioned in clause (b) of sec. 153A (1) is pending on the date of
> search, it shall abate. The present assessment year is 1999-2000 which is
> falling within the period of 6 years but its assessment is complete and
> hence the proceedings do not abate. In other words the original assessment
> was made u/s.
8 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
> M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ======================== 143(3) has become final and is not affected by the
> second proviso to section 153A. Of course, the present assessment is a case
> falling u/s. 153C, but then, as per sub section (2) of section 153C, this
> assessment was also to be done in the manner provided in section 153A.
> Therefore, the second proviso to section 153A applies equally to the cases
> falling u/s. 153C. What follows is that the assessment now to be done is to
> be confined to the material found in the course of search only. The
> additions/disallowances made in the regular assessment cannot be repeated in
> the assessment to be made u/s. 153C of the Act unless fresh material has
> been unearthed in course of search in respect of those
> additions/disallowances "
12\. According to the CIT(A) while making assessment u/s. 153A of the Act, it
is essential that only such additions can be made which are based on material
found in the course of search. He also placed reliance on the order of the
Tribunal Vizag Bench in the case of KGR Exports vs. JCIT in ITA No. 494/V/07
wherein at para 23, the ITAT, Vizag held as under:
> "23. In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that when no
> incriminating material is found during the course of search, the assessing
> officer cannot make any addition on issues which have already been concluded
> even when the assessments were reopened by virtue of provisions of section
> 153A. In such cases, the AO has to complete such assessments without making
> any further addition. Hence the second issue urged before us is answered in
> favour of the assessee. "
13\. Since in the assessment order the Assessing Officer has not made
reference to any specific seized material relating to the disallowances made
by him, the CIT(A) deleted this addition also. Against this deletion, the
Revenue is in appeal before us for the assessment years 2002-03 to 2005-06.
14\. We have heard both the parties on the above issue. In this case the
CIT(A) deleted the addition on the reason that there is no seized material to
estimate the turnover and thereby estimate the  9 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 &
Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== income. Similarly, for determination of expenditure
which was claimed in the regular returns cannot be disallowed in the block
assessment consequent to the search action as the disallowance is only could
be subject matter in regular assessment not in the block assessment. For this
purpose we place reliance on the following precedents:
CIT v. N.R. Papers and Boards Ltd., 248 ITR 526 (Gauhati) "If prior to the
date of search, the assessee had disclosed the particulars of income or
expenditure either in the return or in the books of account or in the course
of proceedings to the Assessing Officer or where the return had not become
due, they are duty recorded in the regular books of account, then such Income
cannot be treated as undisclosed income so as to tax a person ft the rate of
Sixty per cent. Under Chapter XIV.
CIT V. N.R. Papers and Boar'ds Ltd., 248 ITR 526 (Gauhati) "Under the scheme
of the provisions for block assessment it is apparent that it related to
assessment of "undisclosed income" of the assessee excluding the income
subjected to, regular assessment in pursuance of the returns filed by the
assessee for such period. From a perusal of section 158BB of the Income-tax
Act, 1961, it is clear that the returns are required to be filed in pursuance
of a notice under section 158BC(a) and the assessment has to be framed on that
basis in the light of material that had come into the possession of the
assessing authority during the course of search which was the foundation of
proceedings. The correctness or otherwise of the returns filed in pursuance of
the notice under section 158BC(a) has to be examined with reference to the
material in the possession of the assessing authority having nexus to
assessment of "undisclosed income". "
Bhagwati Prasad Kedia v. CIT, 248 ITR 562 (Calcutta) "The Explanation to
section 158BA of the Income-tax Act, 1961, makes it clear that the Legislature
thought it fit to make a distinction, between the block assessment and the
regular assessment. In the case of regular assessment, the Assessing Officer
is free to examine the veracity of the return as well as the claims made by
10 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== the assessee, whereas the undisclosed income is taxed
by way of block assessment as a result of search and seizure. The logic behind
the two different modes of assessment is that concealment of income and
claiming deduction or exemption in respect of a disclosed income cannot be
treated at part. The former is an offence which goes to the root of the matter
and the other is on the basis of the causes shown by the assessee where the
Assessing Officer is free to accept the justification shown or reject the
same."
CIT v, Vikram A. Doshi, 256 ITR 129 (Bom) "Block assessment - undisclosed
income-undisclosed transactions assessed in block assessment-tribunal finding
transactions disclosed in return which were subject-matter of regular
assessments-transactions in question not to be considered in block assessment
- income;-tax act, 1961, ss. 143, 158b."
CIT V. Shamlal Balram Gurbani, 249 ITR 501 (Bom) "A search was conducted at
the residential premises of the assessee on March 25,1996, and a notice under
section 158BC of the Income-tax Act, 1961, was issued; The assessee did not
file the returns for the years 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96. The Assessing
Officer treated the income of the three years as the income of the block
period. On appeal, the Tribunal found that the assessee's income from
interest, salary and rent was reflected in the audited balance-sheet of the
respective assessment years of the firm and, therefore, the Tribunal deleted
the addition."
On appeal the Hon'ble Bombay High Court did not find any reason to interfere
with the findings of facts recorded by the Tribunal. It was held:
> "Held dismissing the appeal, that the conclusion of the Tribunal that there
> was no reason for treating the said income as undisclosed income for the
> purposes of block assessment was based on facts. No substantial question of
> law arose."
CIT v. Vinod Danchand Ghodawat, 247 ITR 448 (Bom) "Where the value of the gold
and silver articles. and jewellery had been disclosed in the assessee's
wealth- tax return which was accepted by the Department:
11 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== Held that Chapter XIV-B of the Income-tax Act 1961,
had no application to the facts of the case and the addition made by the
Department on the ground of undisclosed income was erroneous.
During the search, it was found that the assessee had constructed a bungalow.
It was found that the assessee had incurred an expense of Rs.4.16 lakhs. The
Assessing Officer, thereafter, referred the matter to the Department Valuer,
who valued the property at Rs.
6\. 66 lakhs and accordingly, the difference had been added to the income of
the assessee as undisclosed income:
Held, that the above basis clearly showed that the Department had not
understood the scope of Chapter XIV-B of the Act. The addition did not fall
within the Chapter XIV-B."
15\. Even if it is presumed that post-search enquiries have resulted in
detection of certain undisclosed income, though it is not relatable to the
evidence found as on the date of search then also, Mumbai Bench of the
Tribunal, in the case of Morarji Gokuldas Spg. & Wvg. Co. Ltd. v. DCIT, 95 ITD
1 (MUM) (TM), while considering an identical situation, held as follows:-
> "8. Block period for which the assessment is to be made under Chapter XIV-8
> means the period comprising previous years relevant to ten assessment years
> preceding a previous year in which the search was conducted under section
> 132 or any requisition was made under section 132A, and also includes in the
> previous year in which such search was conducted or requisition made the
> period up to the date of the commencement of such search or as the case may
> be the date of such requisition. Therefore, the assessment for the block
> period under chapter XIV-8 can be made of the undisclosed income only up to
> the date of commencement of search or the date of the requisition and not of

16\. In view of the above discussion, we are inclined to dismiss the Revenue
appeals for the assessment years 2002- 03 to 2005-
06\. ITA Nos. 230 to 232/Hyd/2011 and ITA Nos. 325 to 327/ Hyd/2011 for AYs
2006-07 to 2008:
17\. In these appeal the grievance of the assessee is with regard to
estimation of the income at 15% of the undisclosed turnover and disallowing
net cash expenditure at 7%. The Revenue is in appeal before us for not
confirming the total suppressed turnover as income of the assessee and also
restricting the disallowance of cash expenditure at 7%.
18\. In course of the assessment proceedings, based on the discussion and
analysis made in the assessment order for asst. year 2008809, the Assessing
Officer estimated the net profit on the suppressed turnover for the assessment
year 2006-07 to 2008-09 as under:
                AY 2006-07               Rs. 2,53,55,627
                AY 2007-08               Rs. 2,87,80,355
                AY 2008-09               Rs. 2,14,28,375
19\. In addition to the net profit on the suppressed turnover the Assessing
Officer also made disallowance of expenditure debited to Profit and Loss A/c
in line with the discussion and analysis made in the assessment order for the
assessment years 2006-07, 2007-
13 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== 08 and 2008-09. The disallowances made under various
heads in the asst. year are as under:
                          Production    Employee       Administrative
                A.Y.      expenditure    benefits       Expenditure
                              (Rs.)        (Rs.)            (Rs.)
              2006-07      47,19,097     6,23,760        19,05,822
              2007-08      81,03,750    12,98,420        35,10,400
              2008-09     1,04,11,340   16,60,906        39,37,357
20\. Considering the net profit on suppressed turnover as also the
disallowances made under various heads of expenditure as above, the total
income for the assessment year 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 was assessed at
Rs. 3,57,19,490, Rs. 5,08,05,040 and Rs. 4,97,61,860 respectively. Being
aggrieved against the assessments so made the assessee went in appeal before
the CIT(A).
21\. The CIT(A) given a finding relating to the computation of net profit on
the suppressed turnover that AO to adopt a net profit figure of 15% on the
agreed suppressed turnover for arriving at the undisclosed income on account
of suppressed turnover for the AY 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 as follows:
> Suppressed Net profit @ A.Y. turnover 15% (Rs.) (Rs.) 2006-07 7,04,32,296
> 1,05,64,845 2007-08 7,63,80,984 1,14,57,148 2008-09 5,68,69,360 85,30,404
22\. Regarding the issue relating to disallowance of expenditures under the
heads 'production expenditure', 'employees' benefits' and 'administrative
expenditure' the CIT(A) directed the AO to restrict the disallowance to 7% on
the net cash expenditure under the above heads after making proper
verification of the contention of the assessee about the cash expenditure.
contention of the assessee as above is found to be correct.
14 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
========================
23\. In addition to the above grounds of appeal as above, the assessee has
also raised a ground before the CIT(A) for the asst. year 2007-08 that the
Assessing Officer was not justified in not giving credit for the additional
income of Rs. 57,58,950 already offered by the assessee in the return filed
u/s. 153A while computing the income in the order u/s. 143(3) rws 153A. The
CIT(A) given a finding that from the assessment order for AY 2006-07 as well
as 2008-09 that while making the addition on account of the undisclosed income
on suppressed turnover, the AO has reduced from the profit worked out by him,
the income of Rs. 15,53,670 for the AY 2006-07 and Rs, 43,56,084 for the AY
2008-09 which was apparently admitted by the assessee. However, for the AY
2007-08, the Assessing Officer has worked out a net profit on the suppressed
turnover at Rs. 2,87,80,355 and has not given any credit for undisclosed
income admitted by the assessee. This is a factual issue. Accordingly, he
directed the Assessing officer to verify the return of income filed by the
assessee and if the assessee has already admitted any undisclosed income on
account of the suppressed turnover the same should be reduced from the
undisclosed income worked out by him in accordance with the direction given in
the appellate order as has been done by him in A.Y. 2006-07 and A.Y. 2008-09.
24\. We have heard both the parties and perused the material on record. As
regards the suppressed turnover, the assessee submitted that the turnover has
been estimated for the assessment years 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 based on
the evidences available only for 2 months in the financial year 2005- 06 and 4
months in the financial year 2007-08. The assessee submitted that the AO also
estimated turnover for the financial year 2006-07 though there was no material
to suggest any suppression for that year. He stated that in the statement  15
I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== recorded u/s. 132( 4) in response to question No. 9
the Managing Director had indicated a net profit of 95 lakhs on the estimated
suppressed turnover of Rs. 7 ,04,32,296/- giving a net profit rate of 13.5 per
cent. Since the Managing Director had himself conceded the suppressed turnover
the same was not disputed in the return filed u/s. 153A. However, since the
net result suggested to the Managing Director was too high the assessee
company had admitted nearly 8% income on the admitted suppressed turnover in
the return. The Assessing Officer was of the opinion that the Managing
Director had himself accepted the gross profit as 46% which is supported by
the gross profit admitted in the regular return. Thus, the net income assessed
by the AO on the admitted suppressed turnover was around 41.4% for AY 2006-07
and 42.91 % for AY 2007-08 and 2008-09 which is too high and unachievable in
this line of business. It was submitted that the assessee is in the business
of preparation and sale of food articles at various counters especially in
twin cities. The net profit declared in the regular return was nearly 4%. The
major expenditure incurred by the assessee is on preparation of food articles
which included the cost of raw material i.e. provisions and other items and
labour charges incurred for cooking and other employees. The income estimated
by the AO is too high considering the nature of business. It was also
submitted that the AO completely ignored the basis arrived at in the statement
u/s.132( 4) for the AY 2006-07 wherein the Managing Director stated the next
profit at 13.5% and this estimation remained un-contradicted or opposed by the
investigating officials. The assessee referred to the decision of Hon'ble
ITAT, 'B' Bench, Hyderabad in ITA No. 42/H/05 in the case of ACIT Vs. M/s.
Pahal Food Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad wherein the !TAT directed the AO to adopt the
net profit rate adopted by the assessee to determine the unaccounted income
out of the unaccounted turnover. The assessee also referred to the decision
16 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== of Hon'ble ITAT, 'B' Bench, in the case of ACIT Vs.
Ravi Foods Pvt. Ltd (ITA No, 41/H/105 dated 30-09-2009) wherein the Hon'ble
ITAT have held that the gross profit rate cannot be determinative factor for
arriving at the undisclosed income to be assessed because several outgos such
as indirect cost, selling overheads, and other expenses ought to be incurred
by the assessee even for unaccounted sales and therefore deduction has to be
allowed for the same for arriving at the net undisclosed income. The assessee
therefore submitted that the net income offered to tax in the return u/s. 153A
by the assessee on the admitted suppressed turnover for the assessment years
2006-07 to 2008-09 be accepted.
25\. As regards the disallowance of expenditure claimed in the regular return,
the assessee submitted that the Assessing Officer doubted the genuineness of
the expenditure and made disallowance from 10 to 15 per cent on production
expenditure, employee benefits and administrative expenditure after reducing
director's salary and sales tax payment. Even as per the AO, the production
expenses and employees' benefits are in proportion to the turnover. However,
the administrative expenditure is not in correct proportion. The assessee
submitted that the AO is led away by the figures quoted by him in the Table of
expenses given at page-2 of the assessment order for AY 2008-09. In this table
the figures for AY 2008-09 were not taken correctly. The actual figures for AY
2008-09 are as under:
                                   Production                       Employees
                     Turnover                    Administrative                    Net profit
     Particulars                    expenses                         expenses
                       (Rs.)                     expenses (Rs.)                      (Rs.)
                                      (Rs.)                            (Rs.)
    As per AO      12,76,14,593   1,38,55,248    6,41,32,516       3,94,55,369    1,25,22,161
    As per ROI     12,76,14,593   6,94,40,933    3,94,45,356       1,25,22,161    1,38,55,248
26\. Hence there is no disproportionate increase in any of the expenditure.
The addition is only on wrong presumptions. The assessee submitted that the AO
failed to appreciate the fact that  17 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s.
Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== the books of ale were produced before him and in
support of the genuineness of the expenditure claimed the assessee filed the
data for one assessment year i.e. 2007-08 for the payments made through
banking channels and payments made through cash under each head. The table
shows that more than 50 per cent of the material was purchased through the
banking channel. Further, all salary payments were supported by the relevant
payment of statutory remittance like PF and ESI. All the employees are on the
rolls of PF authorities and the fact that the assessee was paying regularly
the PF contribution indicates the genuineness of the expenditure which the AO
has totally ignored. Even the estimation of expenditure at a fixed percentage
of total amount has resulted in the disallowance of certain items like
property tax, trade licences and rental payments which were totally paid
through banking channel. Further, for the payment like rent, advertisement
charges and security charges tax was deducted at source. The method adopted by
the AO resulted in disallowance of even PF and ESI payments paid within the
due dates. The AO also failed to appreciate the fact that the books are
subjected to audit u/s.44AB of the LT. Act. It was stated that if the payments
to government agencies and the payments covered by ESI, PF & TDS were also
considered, there is hardly any expenditure that can be doubted warranting any
disallowance. The assessee also stated that this sort of addition in a search
assessment without any incriminating material on record is highly arbitrary
and unjustified. Assessee referred to the decisions of Hon'ble ITAT, Kolkata
in the case of LMJ International Ltd, Kolkata Vs. DCIT (21 SOT 315), in
support of its contention that items of regular assessment should not be
disturbed and items like Income and Expenditure which had been disclosed to
the Revenue were outside the purview of the assessment for search cases. At
the end the assessee submitted that it is not disputing  18 I.T.A. No.
727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== the suppressed turnover figure for the assessment
years 2006-07 to 2008-09 but only disputing the percentage of income on the
said agreed suppressed turnover.
27\. According to the learned counsel for the assessee, the assessee's case is
not comparable to any other assessee relied on by the Department. According to
the learned counsel for the assessee, the assessee is engaged in the business
of restaurant and given franchise to various parties. The assessee supplying
the food items like chicken/mutton biryani, chicken/mutton dishes and charge
certain percentage of turnover as franchise fees. . Being so, the assessee
cannot be compared to any other cases. He submitted that assessee's rate of
profit in earlier year could be the best yardstick to ascertain income from
suppressed turnover. He relied on the order of the Tribunal dated 23rd
November, 2010 in the case of Prakash Arts Moving Media, Hyderabad in ITA Nos.
305 to 308/ Vizag/2008 wherein it was held as under:
> "14. Having carefully examined the seized material and the other record
> available before us, we are of the view that where none of the statements of

> of the profit comes to 5.85%. The assessee has also furnished the details of
> the additions if particular percentage is adopted to determine the net
> profit. For the sake of reference the extract of the chart is hereunder:"
28\. On the other hand, the DR strongly opposed the argument of the counsel
for the assessee. The learned DR submitted it is an admitted fact that the
assessee consistently suppressed the turnover by removing the 'zero' in the
turnover figures. He relied on the following orders of the Tribunal:
> 1\. ACIT vs. M/s. Ch. Marthanda Rao & Co. in ITA No. 780 to 784/Hyd/2010
> Order dated 18th August, 2010 wherein the Tribunal held as under:
> "5. We have considered the submissions of the learned Departmental
> Representative and perused the material available on record. The Parliament
> by Finance Act, 2003 inserted section 158BI in the Statute Book. Section
> 158BI clearly says that Chapter XIV-B which provides procedure for
> computation of undisclosed income for the block period will not be
> applicable in respect of searches conducted on or after 1.6.2003. Section
> 158BB(1) provides for computation of undisclosed income on the basis of
> material found during the course of search operations or the information
> which is relatable to thematerial found during the course of search
> operation. This section 158BB(1) falls under Chapter XIV-B of the Act. In
> view of section 158BI, section 158BB(1) is not applicable in respect of
> searches conducted after 1.6.2003. Therefore, it is obvious that the
> Assessing Officer need not follow the procedure prescribed under section
> 158BB(1) of the Act in respect of the searches conducted after 1.6.2003."
> 2\. In the case of M/s. Bawarchi Restaurant in ITSSA No. 170/Hyd/2005 dated
> 14.7.2006 wherein it was held as follows:
> "For the balance period from 1.4.2002 to 31.12.2002, the sales from the
> general section can be reasonably  20 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s.
> Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ======================== estimated at Rs. 40 lakhs. Thus, the total sales
> estimated from general and parcel section for the period 16.11.2001 to
> 2.1.2003 can be fairly estimated at Rs.
60 lakhs. Coming to the sale figures of AC and Roof Garden sections, the sales
figures arrived at by the AO based on ISR and IPR reports is acceptable and
this gives a figure of Rs. 1,91,90,088/-. A part of this sales (approx. 30%)
is routed through the general sections, the estimate of Rs. 60 lakhs as
general section sales is in our opinion, reasonable. The AO has recorded a
finding that the suppression of sales is to the tune of 90.50%. This fact is
recorded by the CIT(A) in para 3(c)(i) of his order. While os, the estimate of
Rs. 8.72 crore is against this finding. Thus, as the estimations made by the
AO, which is confirmed by the first appellate authority are highly excessive
and as they do not bear any relationship with the sales figures accepted by
the Commercial Tax Department as well as by the AO and CIT(A) themselves. As
against the estimate of Rs. 26,51,292/- undisclosed turnover admitted over and
above the recorded turnover of Rs. 91,10,718/- and Rs. 7,88,41,158/-
unaccounted sales estimated by the revenue, for the period prior to
15.11.2001, we direct the AO to adopt the following figures as the total
turnover of the assessee for the period 16.11.2001 to 2.1.2003:
a) Sales of AC and Roof Garden Section Rs.1,91,90,088/- (Based on IPR's and
ISR's)
b) Sales from General and Parcel Section- Rs. 60,00,000/- (Based on sales tax
inspection) From this total, the sales disclosed to the department, which are
recorded in the regular books of accounts, have to be eliminated and only the
balance should be treated as undisclosed sales of the assessee.
Coming to the issue of gross profit, we hold the finding of the AO as
concurred by the first appellate authority that the gross profit should be
estimated at 35% of undisclosed turnover for the AC and Roof Garden Section is
slightly on the higher side. The menu card, copies of which are in the seized
material show that the prices charged in Roof Garden section is less than the
AC section. So the gross profit of Roof Garden section may be estimated at 30%
and of AC section at  21 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House
Pvt. Ltd.
======================== 35%. Coming to the general and parcel section, the
first appellate authority has for the period from 1.4.2001 to 15.11.2001
directed the AO to estimate the gross profits at 30%. As the general and
parcel section category of customers are different from the higher category,
who used AC and Roof Gardens, and as one biriyani is sufficient for about 6 to
8 persons, the gross profits from the sales may be estimated at 25% of that
turnover from general and parcel section. We are of the opinion that this is a
fair estimate of gross profits and direct the AO to estimate the gross profit
at 25% from the undisclosed turnover of general and parcel section. The
assessee gets partial relief.
3\. In the case of K. Suresh, Kadapa in ITA No. 136/Hyd/2008 dated 13th
August, 2008 the Tribunal held as under:
> "8. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material
> available on record. The only point in dispute is whether it is only the
> profit in relation to the unaccounted sales, or the entire amount of
> unrecorded sales that should be added to the income of the assessee. The
> case of the Revenue is that it is for the assessee to establish that it is
> not only the sales but also the supportive/corresponding purchases that were
> not accounted for. The assessing officer has recorded that there is no
> difference in the opening stock, purchases and closing stock, and the only
> difference is in relation to the sales, and that being so, there is no
> difference with regard to the cost of sales and consequently, entire sales
> not recorded in the books of account represents the unaccounted income qf
> the assessee. The CIT(A) was of the view that the contention of the assessee
> that it is only the profit on the unaccounted for sales which is liable to
> be added, is acceptable only if the assessee establishes that not only the
> sales but also the purchases in relation to those sales were unaccounted
> for. Despite several opportunities given, assessee could not furnish
> particulars of unaccounted purchases which yielded income out of the
> unaccounted for sales. In that view of the matter, the CIT(A) upheld the
> addition made by the assessing officer. We do not find any fault in the

> I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ======================== of sales, by furnishing necessary evidence in the

> unaccounted for sales have also not been accounted for by it. In the
> circumstances, we uphold the orders of the lower authorities, and reject the
> grounds of the assessee in this appeal."
29\. Further he relied on the judgement of jurisdictional High Court in the
case of Rajnik & Co. vs. ACIT (251 ITR 561) (AP) wherein held as under:
> "Held, that the assessee was not able to dispute the findings of the
> Assessing Officer as well as the Tribunal where the seized material had
> shown that there was suppression for a period of 24 days during the
> assessment year 1996-97 and 15 days for 1997-98 and also that the
> suppressions were on a day-to-day basis and the evidence recorded from the
> partner had shown that the same method was adopted throughout the assessment
> years for the entire block period. Where the assessee had carried on the
> business for the full year, the addition was made at six times the
> suppression found during that year and for the assessment year 1997-98 the
> addition was restricted to only three times, as the assessee had carried on
> the business only for half of the period with reference to the earlier year,
> where six times addition was made. It was clear from the order of the

> House Pvt. Ltd.
> ======================== Assessing Officer was on the higher side and the
> Tribunal on consideration of the material on record redetermined the
> suppressed turnover as well as the undisclosed income which was reasonable
> and proper."
30\. He also relied on the decision in the case of Carpenters Classics (Exim)
(P) Ltd. vs. ACIT (108 ITD 142)(Bang.) wherein it was held as under:
> "Held, If the sales are understated in the books of account by not
> disclosing the exact amount of sale in respect of an item, then the entire
> unrecorded sales turnover is income as corresponding purchases are debited.
> However, if sales are made outside the books of account by making purchases
> outside the books of account, then profit earned from such turnover is to be
> added as income. In the instant case, there was no material to show that
> unaccounted cash receipts were only in respect of additional work executed.
> During the course of search, certain papers in torn condition represented
> the cash receipts. It was admitted that these receipts were not available in
> any record.
> The assessee has made declaration vide letter dated 22.1.1999, and such
> letter was not alleged to have been obtained under threat or coercion. This
> was voluntary declaration. The assessee estopped the Department for making

======================== view of such letter, the onus was on the assessee to
establish that offer was under any misconception of facts. In the letter
itself, it had been mentioned that the assessee was not in a position to
provide material evidence for the actual amount spent by the clients either
through them or themselves. It was also mentioned that margin of profit in
executing additional work was generally 8 to 10 per cent. The Managing
Director of the assessee was fully aware of the facts at the time of filing
declaration. It could not be said that declaration was under any misconception
of facts. The assessee had failed to discharge the onus that declaration was
under any misconception of facts.
Further, the undisclosed income at an amount of Rs. 1.7 crores was determined
by the Commissioner (Appeals) on the basis of the letter filed by the
assessee. It was not a pure estimation, but it was a computation of
undisclosed income.
In the instant case, declaration was given to Authorised Officer and,
subsequently, the assessee had not taken any steps to rectify such declaration
before the authority before whom such declaration was filed.
Further, the declaration in the instant case was not on the day when search
was commenced. The only reason given for not showing such undisclosed income
was that for additional civil work, margin of profit was only 8 to 10 per
cent. Such fact was known to the assessee and was mentioned in the letter.
Hence, no valid reason was given for retraction of statement.
In the instant case, the assessee had not retracted the disclosure before the
Authorised Officer but had not included the undisclosed income while filing
return on 13.4.1999. Disclosure was admitted vide letter dated 22.1.1999.
Thus, the time gap was too large. Hence, the Commissioner (Appeals) was
justified in determining undisclosed income on the basis of letter filed by
the assessee.
It was also contended by the assessee that the revenue had not been able to
establish that assets or expenses corresponding to undisclosed income had been
found during search. The assessee had shown undisclosed income to the extent
of around Rs. 68 lakhs and had not explained as to where such amounts stood
25 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== invested. It is not the case of the assessee that
undisclosed income had been returned on the basis of assets or expenses not
recorded in the books of account. The assessee itself filed the declaration of
undisclosed income of Rs. 1.07 crore. Hence, there was no onus on the Revenue
to establish that such undisclosed income was in the form of assets etc.
Section 158B(b) defines undisclosed income and such income can be based on
entries found in the seized records. Therefore, the Commissioner (Appeals) was
justified in determining the undisclosed income to the extent of Rs. 1.07
crores."
31\. We have carefully gone through the above submission of the parties.
Regarding computation of undisclosed income on the suppressed turnover, it is
a fact on record that the assessee does not dispute the suppressed turnover
worked out by the Assessing Officer. What the assessee actually disputes is
the percentage of net profit worked out by the AO. The AO while working out
the net profit has basically relied on the gross profit ratio of 46% for the
assessment year 2006-07 and 47.68% for the AY 2007-08 and 2008-09. From these,
he has given a deduction of 10% to work out the net profit on the suppressed
turnover. That way, the AO has worked out a net profit on the suppressed
turnover as against the normal profit disclosed by the assessee. The assessee
relied on the decision of ITAT, Hyderabad in the case of ACIT Central Circle-
4, Hyderabad Vs. Ravi Foods Pvt Ltd in IT(SS)A No, 41/Hyd/2005. In this case,
the assessee company was in the business of manufacture of biscuits and other
confectionery items. A search was conducted in the assessee's case during
which certain incriminating material evidencing suppression of turnover was
found. The AO found that the accounted turnover constituted about 45.38% of
total turnover and consequently the unaccounted turnover was around 54.62% of
the total turnover. Based on the seized documents the AO worked out the
unaccounted turnover for the entire block period and estimated the undisclosed
income in relation to such suppressed turnover applying the same ratio of  26
I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== gross profit as disclosed on accounted turnover and
determined the undisclosed income. While deciding the appeals, the Hon'ble
ITAT Hyderabad at page 11 para 7 of the order observed as under:
> "We find certain inherent mistakes and inconsistencies in approach of both
> the lower authorities while estimating the undisclosed income for various
> years falling within the block by extrapolation on the basis of material
> seized for two months viz., Dec. 2001 and Jan 2002\. Firstly, both the lower
> authorities have determined income applying gross profit rate of purportedly
> of the respective assessment years to the unaccounted turnover estimated for
> that year by extrapolation. It cannot be denied that gross profit rate
> cannot be the determinative factor for arriving at the undisclosed income to
> be assessed because several outgos such as indirect costs, selling
> overheads, and other expenses have to be incurred by the assessee even for
> such unaccounted sale and therefore deduction has to be allowed for the same
> for arriving at the net undisclosed income."
32\. At para 9 of the said order, the Hon'ble ITAT Hyderabad further observed
as under:
> "As for estimation of undisclosed income in relation to such undisclosed
> turnover determined at 35% of accounted turnover, we are of the considered
> view that the lower authorities were not justified in determining the
> undisclosed income by adopting gross profit rate at the relevant
> years/period. It is a settled position of law as laid down 'among others by
> the Delhi High Court in the case of CfT Vs. Satish Kukar Chandana, New Delhi
> vide judgement dated 2119-2007 in ITA No. 142 of 2004, besides the decisions
> of various Benches of tribunal including the Hyderabad Benches in similar
> matters, it is only the net profit and not the gross profit rate that is
> relevant to disclose the undisclosed income, since even in respect of gross
> profit in relation to~ suppressed turnover, certain amount of indirect cost
> are to be incurred by the assessee and it is after exclusion of the same
> from the gross profit that one can arrive at the net profit and most
> importantly undisclosed income in relation to such unaccounted turnover.
> This more so when the unaccounted turnover forms a significant portion of
> the total turnover and is estimated as a  27 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
> M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
> ======================== percentage of the accounted turnover as high as 35%

> the assessee.
33\. Thus, from the decisions of Hon'ble ITAT, Hyderabad 'A' Bench, as above,
it is evident that the undisclosed income on suppressed turnover cannot be
based on the gross profit rate adopted for the year concerned. In the appeal
under consideration, the AO has adopted the gross profit rate on the
suppressed turnover and has given a deduction of 10% towards indirect cost. In
terms of the definition of Hon'ble ITAT, Hyd. referred to above the method
adopted by the AO is erroneous. What the AO should have adopted is the net
profit rate being disclosed. The CIT(A), given the finding that the assesee
himself had admitted 13.5% profit for the FY 2005-06 on the undisclosed
turnover and estimated the net profit rate of 15% on the undisclosed turnover
for the years under consideration for arriving at the undisclosed income on
the suppressed turnover. However, the AR filed details of net profit declared
by the assessee for earlier years as follows:

10.86* * According to the assessee for the assessment year 2008-09 the rate of
profit is at 10.86% on the reason that there was an extraordinary receipt of
royalty of Rs. 75.25 lakhs in this assessment year .
Average net profit : 5.38%
34\. In this case, the Assessing Officer has not only enhanced the gross
profit rate but also increased the estimate and increased the quantum of
turnover. The assessee has not disputed the quantum of suppressed turnover.
However, the assessee challenged the rate of net profit and filed a chart as
above. As regards the net profit, we find that in earlier years records and
past history could be the basis to determine the rate of profit provided if
the book results are actually accepted by the Department in earlier years. In
the present case all the assessments from 2002-03 to 2008-09 are subject
matter of dispute before us and we cannot take the result of these assessment
years as base to determine the net profit. In our opinion, considering the
nature of industry and prevailing market conditions, it is reasonable to
estimate net profit at 8% of the suppressed turnover. Accordingly, we direct
the Assessing Officer to estimate the income of the assessee at 8% of the
suppressed turnover in addition to the income from regular business. The
ground raised by the assessee for these three assessment years i.e., 2006-07,
2007-08 and 2008-09 is partly allowed.
29 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors.
M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
========================
35\. With regard to disallowance of expenditure debited to Profit and Loss A/c
the AO has made the disallowance on the premise that there is a chance of
inflation of expenditure under the head production expenditure, employee
benefits and administrative expenditure. The assessee on the other hand
submitted that majority of the expenditure was incurred through banking
channel. The assessee also submitted that during the course of assessment
proceeding, the books of account were produced before the AO in support of the
genuineness of the expenditure claimed and the assessee had also filed a data
for one asst. year 2007-08 segregating the payments made through banking
channels and payments made through cash. During the course of first appellate
proceeding, the assessee have filed details segregating the expenses. As per
the said details of production expenses, only partial payment is by cash and
the balance is by cheques. Similarly, for the employees benefits less
director's remuneration partial payments were made by cheque towards PF and
ESI contribution and balance paid by way of salaries covered by PF and ESI. As
regards administrative expenses less sales tax amounting to a portion includes
statutory payments like electricity charges, property tax, food licence,
labour licence, trade licence etc. This apart payment of franchise commission,
sales tax appeal etc. were stated to have been made by cheques. The assessee
also submitted that on payment of rent, franchise commission and security
services, in fact TDS was also deducted.
36\. The AO himself has observed in the assessment order that the assessee had
given a break up of production expenditure dividing into purchase of raw
materials and packing material. He further observed that it is impossible to
verify each and every bill and voucher in support of the production
expenditure. Thereafter, he made a disallowance of 15% of the production
expenditure presuming that there is always a chance of inflation of
expenditure  30 I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.
======================== under this head. The AO has not pinpointed any
specific item where there has been inflation of expenditure. Neither any
incriminating material relating to inflation of expenditure has been found and
discussed by the Assessing Officer. Accordingly, in my view, a flat
disallowance of 15% on the total expenditure is unwarranted. In this line of
business, the majority of the production expenditure relates to purchase of
provision, fire, bread, vegetable, mutton, chicken, fish etc which are
procured from the open market from unorganized sector. There is all likelihood
of payment of cash due to insistence of the seller for such procurement. At
the same time, it also cannot be ruled be certain inflation of expenditure
especially where the payment is cash. Considering the line of business, and
also considering the fact that no specific instance of inflation of
expenditure has been pointed out by the ASSESSING OFFICER, disallowance of 15%
flat is on higher side and even sustained by CIT(A) the said disallowance at
7% on the cash expenditures is also higher side. In our opinion, the
disallowance at 5% of cash expenses other than statutory payments and payments
to Government authorities and the amount subjected to TDS is sufficient in
view of the discrepancies noticed by the authorities. For this purpose we
place reliance on order of the Tribunal in the case of M/s GSP Infratech
Development Ltd., Hyderabad in ITA Nos. 1396/Hyd/2011 and others vide order
dated 27th December, 2011 wherein we have confirmed the disallowance at 5% of
such expenses by holding as follows in para-9 :-
> "We have heard the parties and perused the material on record. The assessee
> is a subcontractor. Assessee is engaging labour at site at far flung places.
> In such circumstances, it is difficult to have documents for such
> expenditure, to the satisfaction of the assessing officer. It is also
> difficult to verify the identity of the labour, after lapse of many years.
> The accounts of the assessee have been audited and auditor's certificate
> under section 44AB has also been furnished. The assessing officer has not
> analysed the expenses compared to the turnover for the earlier years. A  31
> I.T.A. No. 727/Hyd/2010 & Ors. M/s. Hyderabad House Pvt. Ltd.

> the possibility of some inflation of such expenses cannot be ruled out.
> Considering totality of facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the

dismissed.
