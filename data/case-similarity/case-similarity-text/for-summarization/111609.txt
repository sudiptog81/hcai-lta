JUDGMENT S. Mukerjee, J.
IA No. 11043/2001
1\. Alongside diamonds and designer clothes, perfumes are a lady's (and in
these unisex times perhaps even a man's) best friend.
2\. This case deals with the world renowned "chanel" brand of perfumes in the
context of an application for interim injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2,
preferred by M/s Chanel Limited a foreign company manufacturing and marketing
various kinds of perfumes and cosmetics and having established world-wide
reputation with actual sales of about Rs. 5000 million in the three years
immediately preceding the filing of the suit.
3\. During this period the expenditure on advertisement is stated to be the
region of about Rs. 500 million every year.
4\. The plaintiff has set out in paragraphs 4-9 the details of various
registered trademarks and particulars of registration certificate etc. in
relation to its products.
entitled to grant of injunction in its favor till the final disposal of the
main suit.
12\. Accordingly an order of interim injunction is granted in favor of the
plaintiff restraining the defendants, their partners, stockists, agents and
dealers from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly
or indirectly dealing in perfumes under the impugned trade mark "SHANELLE" or
any other trademark identical to, or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
trademark "CHANEL" or which amounts to infringement of trademark Registration
Nos. 13385, 266305, 336035, 517221, 517222 and 517223 and/or passing off of
the goods and/or business of the defendants as and/or for those of the
plaintiff.
13\. Application is accordingly decided in favor of plaintiff as allowed to
above extent.
14\. It is made clear that above observations are limited to the context of
prayer for interim injunction only.
IA No. 11043/2001 stands disposed of. S. No. 2436/2001 List before the Joint
relation to its products.
5\. The case of the plaintiff is that it is having this trademark since the
year 1925, when the same was adopted in Great Britain by the plaintiffs
predecessor-in-title.
The said trade mark was adopted on the basis of surname of its French promoter
and the pronunciation of the trademark "CHANEL", is starting with the "sh"
sound and the last three letters dragged out into a longer sound "NELLE".
6\. The suit has been filed both on the allegation of infringement of
trademark, in the sense that the defendant's mark "SHANELLE" is deceptively
similar to the registered trademark "CHANEL" of the plaintiff; and also on the
point that the defendant is passing off its products as those of, and for,
that of the plaintiff. The goods of both parties, are admittedly pertaining to
the same category viz. perfumes.
7\. The defense is primarily on two aspects. Firstly, that trademark
"SHANELLE" being used by the defendant, is not deceptively similar to the
plaintiffs registered trademark "CHANEL". Secondly, that there is an allegedly
long delay on the part of the plaintiff which disables the plaintiff from
claiming any injunctive relief.
8\. I heard both parties at some length of their respective contentions.
9\. My findings prima facie on the following aspects involved in the matter
are as under:
(i) The plaintiff has prima facie established that it is a reputed and
internationally renowned company dealing in perfumes under various trademarks
with "CHANEL" being the most prominent trademark of the plaintiff. It has very
substantial turn-over and advertisement expenses in relation to its registered
trademark. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has rightly relied upon Sections
28 and 29 of the Trademark Act and the reported decisions of the Supreme Court
K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal & Co, and Anr., and Parle Products
(P) Ltd v. J.P. & Co., Mysore, to canvass the proposition that once the
plaintiff is found to be having a registered mark, that itself confers on the
plaintiff an absolute right of injunction as soon as infringing mark is shown
to be capable of deceiving or causing confusion.
In my considered view similarity could be either visual or phonetic or
otherwise. It need not be a similarity in all respects. It is also held that
where the court reaches a conclusion that there is imitation, no further
evidence is required to establish violation of plaintiff's rights. It is also
held that a brand is recalled imperfectly and remembered by general
impression. Variations between the competing brands may be supposed to have
been made by the manufacturers themselves and, therefore, despite variation
between trade marks, confusion or deception may occur amongst the consumers on
account of overall similarity and imperfect recollection. In the present case,
there may be difference in the packaging, but they are visual differences. The
trade marks CHANEL and SHANELLE are phonetically identical.
They may also be confused for each other on account of imperfect recollection
of spelling of plaintiff's trade mark.
(ii) The learned counsel for the defendant did try to make out a contention to
the effect that in India no one will confuse or be deceived between "CH" sound
and the "SH" sound. However, in my view on the material which has been brought
on record by the plaintiff/applicant, and also by taking judicial notice of
the pronunciation of alphabets "CH" as "SH" under number of circumstances,
including in relation to plaintiff's trademark which is shown as being
pronounced with "SH" sound, even in the Websters Dictionary, I find no merit
in this objection.
As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case reported in Parle Products
(P) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co. Mysore, as under:-
"In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that
the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity
between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually
or phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there
is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the
plaintiff's rights are violated....,"
In the case of Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that the question of deceptive similarity has to be approached applying
the test of imperfect recollect. It is the overall similarity which is to be
considered observing as under:-
". ... As we said in Com Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products
Ltd., , the question has to be approached from point of view of a man of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall
structural and phonetic similarity of the two names "Amritdhara" and
"Lakshmandhara" is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion....."
In K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal & Co. and Anr., while dealing
with marks "Sri Ambal" and "Sri Andal" the Supreme Court held that there is
striking similarity and affinity of sound between "Ambal" and "Andal". Even
though there is no visual resemblance between the two marks, but because of
phonetic resemblance the trade marks were held to be deceptively similar and
the registration was refused holding as under:
". . . . There is a striking similarity and affinity of sound between the
words "andal" and "Ambal". Giving due weight to the judgment of the Registrar
and bearing in mind the conclusions of the learned Single Judge and the
Division, we are satisfied that there is a real danger of confusion between
the two marks."
"There is no evidence of actual confusion, but that might be due to the fact
that the appellant's trade is not of long standing, there is no visual
resemblance between the two marks, but ocular comparison is not always the
decisive test. The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with
reference to the ear as well as the eye. There is a close affinity of sound
between Ambal and Andal."
The plaintiff has also claimed injunction on the ground of passing off. The
principles of passing off have been succinctly laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and Anr.,
that the law of passing off is designed to protect traders against unfair
competition which consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or
misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival
traders.
In my view, deception and confusion prima facie may be taken to occur on
account of:-
    (a)      Imperfect recollection of the plaintiff's trade mark due to phonetic similarity;
    (b)      During verbal pronouncement or hearing, it is not possible to identify whose trade mark is being referred to, both being pronounced as "SHANEL";
    (c)      The first time consumers who have only heard about plaintiff's trade mark and its reputation but not purchased plaintiff's perfumes, are likely to associate the defendant's perfumes with the plaintiff's goods and business and purchase it;
    (d)      A consumer dissatisfied with the defendant's product would refer to the defendant's perfumes as CHANEL;
    (e)      The confusion or deception may be about goods or about the source. The defendant's goods may be associated with the source originating from the plaintiff. The variation may be presumed as having been made by the plaintiff. The defendant's merchandise may be perceived as an Indian and cheaper franchised produce of the plaintiff. The questions and doubts arisen in the consumers' mind are not answered. The extent and nature of the activities of both the parties are not known to the consumers. 
The abovementioned incidents of confusion and deception are forms of
"injurious association" which would injure the goodwill and reputation of the
plaintiff which cannot be assessed, quantified or compensated in monetary
terms. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in
Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and Anr., as under:-
"... The legal and economic basis of this tort is to provide protection for
the right of property which exists not in a particular name, mark or style but
in an established business, commercial or professional reputation or goodwill.
So to sell merchandise or carry on business under such a name, mark,
description, or otherwise in such a manner as to mislead the public into
believing that the merchandise or business is that of another person is a
wrong, actionable at the suit of that other person. This form of injury is
commonly, though awkwardly, termed as that of passing of one's goods or
business as the goods or business of another and is the most important example
of the wrong of injurious falsehood. The gist of the conception of passing off
is that the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about themselves, are
saying something about themselves which is calculated to mislead. The law on
this matter is designed to protect traders against that form of unfair
competition which consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or
misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival
traders."
I find prima facie that the phonetic similarity between the trademark of the
plaintiff and the mark adopted by the defendant, is so much that in
juxtaposition no explanation has been given by the defendant for using a word
having no common parlance meaning and significance "SHANELLE" and which sounds
identical to the trade mark CHANEL of the plaintiff and using the same in
respect of perfumes for which the plaintiff's trademark warrants the grant of
injunction in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant on account of
infringing mark of the defendant being deceptively similar with that of the
plaintiff, both on the ground of infringement and passing off;
(iii) Coming now to the other point of delay, it may be noted that plaintiff
claims that it came to know about the defendant's mark in January 1995
pursuant to publication in the Trademark Journal whereupon the plaintiff filed
opposition which was decided only on 28.4.2000. Against the said decision,
plaintiff preferred an appeal which is still pending, wherein there has been
an ex-parte stay of the decision appealed against vide this Court's order
dated 7.8.2000;
(iv) As such according to plaintiff there has been no delay at all, since the
opposition proceedings and the appeal thereafter is continuing till date. If
during this period the defendant has used his infringing mark, that has been
at defendant's own peril;
(v) In the case of a registered mark, the defense of delay, is very, very
limited, if at all available. In Shri Swaran Singh Trading as Appliances
Emporium v. Usha Industries (India) New Delhi and Anr., of this Court held
that an exclusive right is granted by the registration to the holder of a
registered trade mark and is a statutory right which cannot be lost by delay.
defense of laches or delay can be set up in equity but it cannot be put forth
by some one who had not acted fairly and honestly and has used the trade mark
of another person.
In absence of any satisfactory explanation by the appellants, the adoption of
the mark by them cannot prima facie is regarded as honest and plea of delay
and laches would be of no avail to them. Moreover even if there is an
inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking action against the
defendant, the relief of injunction is not to be denied. The defense of laches
or inordinate delay is a defense in equity. Inordinate delay or laches may
defeat the claim of damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of
injunction should not be refused. The defendant has not been able to make out
that case. The defendant has failed to show sale of impugned products in the
open market. All the sale of the defendant's goods are confined to
canteens/stores of Ministry of defense. I also agree with the further
contention of plaintiff's counsel that even assuming there is delay, that can
only adversely affect the plaintiff's claim for damages but not the claim for
injunction.
On the point of delay, I also find that plaintiff has been able to explain the
entire period which has been consumed by the objections filed by the
plaintiff, as the appeal against the same is pending before this Court, where
there is an interim order operating in favor of the plaintiff to the extent of
stay of an order of the Registrar by which he had declined relief to the
plaintiff. There is merit in plaintiff's contention that where adoption of the
mark is mala fide or where trademark is so deceptively similar, delay cannot
be a ground to deny the relief of injunction.
(vi) The other defense of the defendant viz. that he has been a user for the
last about 17 years and that his bona fides are clear from the fact that he
has not adopted either shape of the bottle or the design of the label of the
plaintiff does not appeal to me to disentitle the holder of registered mark
from injunction.
(vii) Furthermore it is contended by defendant that a trademark is to be
understood in the language in which the mark is written and not by the
different pronunciations or different language or nuances of the different
language such as French language tone to be adopted in relation to the word
"CHANEL" written in the alphabet language but with "CH" being pronounced as
"SH".
10\. Considering the wide spread pronunciation of the alphabets "CH" when
placed together as "SH" and also the acknowledgment of same even in the
Websters Dictionary, to my mind the defendant cannot be allowed to adopt
hairsplitting defense regarding pronunciation. The use of sound "SH" for words
beginning with alphabet is "CH" is quite common.
11\. Considering the above, I find that in the present case all the
ingredients required for grant of interim injunction viz. strong prima facie
case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss and hardship do exist in
favor of plaintiff in the present case, and therefore, the plaintiff is
entitled to grant of injunction in its favor till the final disposal of the
main suit.
12\. Accordingly an order of interim injunction is granted in favor of the
plaintiff restraining the defendants, their partners, stockists, agents and
dealers from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly
or indirectly dealing in perfumes under the impugned trade mark "SHANELLE" or
any other trademark identical to, or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
trademark "CHANEL" or which amounts to infringement of trademark Registration
Nos. 13385, 266305, 336035, 517221, 517222 and 517223 and/or passing off of
the goods and/or business of the defendants as and/or for those of the
plaintiff.
13\. Application is accordingly decided in favor of plaintiff as allowed to
above extent.
14\. It is made clear that above observations are limited to the context of
prayer for interim injunction only.
