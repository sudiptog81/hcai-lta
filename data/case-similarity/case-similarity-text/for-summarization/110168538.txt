28\. When the impugned order is tested on the anvil of above analysis, we are
of considered opinion that the same being contrary to the principle of law
laid down in Farooq Mohammed (supra) in respect of as to how the matter is to
be referred to a larger Bench, we set aside the order and remit the matter to
learned Single Judge. At this stage, a question arises as to whether when
apprised of the controversy qua the status of an SDO(P)/CSP/Dy. S.P., whether
this Court, in intra-court appeal, can decide the same. The answer, in our  28
WA-545-2020 considered opinion, is emphatic 'No'. That will be within the
domain of the reference Court in case of a reference made in accordance with
the law laid down in Farooq Mohammad (supra).
29\. The appeal is disposed of finally in above terms. No costs.

                                           ORDER
Per Sanjay Yadav, J :-
This intra-court appeal under Section 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Uchcha
Nyayalaya (Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005, is directed against an
order dated 19.03.2020 passed in Writ Petition No.6847/2020; whereby, learned
Single Judge while disagreeing with the decision by a Division Bench in  2
WA-545-2020 the case of Devi Singh Thakur vs S.N. Pathak and others : Writ
Appeal No.693/2019 decided on 06.12.2019, which held that the CSP/DSP are not
involved in operational duties, has stayed the transfer of the petitioner and
simultaneously, has directed to place the matter before Hon'ble the Chief
Justice to refer the matter to a Larger Bench.
2\. The writ petition at the instance of the petitioner, a Sub- Divisional
Officer (Police) posted at Itarsi District Hoshangabad was directed against
the order dated 11.03.2020; whereby, he was transferred to Women's Crime Cell,
Bhopal on the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police. By the same order, the
present appellant, a Sahayak Senani, was transferred from 34 th Battalion
Visbal, District Dhar to Itarsi District Hoshangabad on the post of Sub-
Divisional Officer (Police). Consequent whereof, as is evident from the
documents on record, the present appellant was relieved of his duties from
earlier place of posting vide order dated 13.03.2020. Similarly, the
petitioner, respondent No.4 herein, was also relieved vide order dated
17.03.2020.
3\. However, learned Single Judge without adverting to these aspects and
merely on the basis of the contention raised on behalf of  3 WA-545-2020 the
petitioner that the petitioner was on operational duties, stayed the transfer
by order dated 19.03.2020 passed in Writ Petition No.6847/2020, while prima
facie disagreeing with the decision in Devi Singh Thakur (supra).
4\. This intra-court appeal takes exception to the impugned order on the
ground that the judgment by Division Bench in Devi Singh Thakur (supra) was
binding on learned Single Bench and it was beyond the jurisdiction of learned
Single Bench to have disagreed with it and place the matter before Hon'ble the
Chief Justice for its placing before a larger Bench. Instead, it is urged
that, the learned Single Judge ought to have referred the matter to the Chief
Justice as contemplated under sub-rule (3) of Rule 8 of Chapter 4 of the High
Court of Madhya Pradesh, 2008 instead of holding that the petitioner, being an
SDO(P), is on operational duty. It is further contended that since the
Division Bench in Devi Singh Thakur (supra) had already held that an incumbent
holding the post of City Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of
Police being not "an operational post" as could enure benefit from the
judgment in Prakash Singh vs Union of India (2006) 8 SCC 1. It is urged that
learned Single Judge who was bound by the decision ought not to  4 WA-545-2020
have stayed the transfer, more particularly, when the petitioner was relieved
from his post on 17.03.2020. On these contentions, the appellant seeks
indulgence.
5\. Respondent No.4, on his turn, opposes the relief and indulgence sought by
the appellant. It is urged that, the issue regarding competency of learned
Single Judge to place the matter before Hon'ble Chief Justice to refer the
matter to a Larger Bench cannot be adjudicated in a writ appeal and can, at
best, be considered by the Bench to which the matter is directed to be
referred. In other words, it is urged that, it is for the Bench other than the
Division Bench hearing a Writ Appeal to which the matter be referred by
Hon'ble the Chief Justice, will have the competence to determine whether the
controversy deserves a reference. It is urged that learned Single Judge was
well within his competence to arrive at a prima facie opinion that the
petitioner, an SDO(P), is on operational duty. It is contended that being a
prima facie opinion, it cannot be said that it runs counter to the decision by
Division Bench in Devi Singh Thakur (supra). It is urged that in the case of
Devi Singh Thakur (supra), the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988 and that of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled  5 WA-545-2020 Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, which empowers Deputy Superintendent
of Police to investigate the crime, were not considered; therefore, it is
urged that, learned Single Judge was well within its jurisdiction in raising
doubt about the correctness of said decision holding that the CSP/DSP was not
an 'operational post' as could be protected by the verdict in Prakash Singh
(supra). Referring to Rule 8 of Chapter 4 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh,
2008, it is urged that sub-rule (3) of Rule 8 empowers a Judge sitting alone
while hearing a case if is of the opinion that an earlier decision of co-
ordinate Bench or larger Bench of this Court needs reconsideration, to
formulate question(s) and refer the same to the Chief Justice with a
recommendation that it be placed before a larger Bench. Being so empowered, it
is contended that the order of reference cannot be interfered with in an
intra-court appeal. Justifying the reference, it is urged that since under the
provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and of the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, the
Deputy Superintendent of Police are empowered to investigate their cadre
cannot be treated to be 'non-operational post'. It is further contended that
in a hot haste manner in which the petitioner was  6 WA-545-2020 relieved from
34th Battalion Visbal, District Dhar on 17.03.2020 was indicative of the fact
that the present appellant was favoured and; therefore, learned Single Judge
was well within its jurisdiction in staying the operation of his transfer even
after relieving. It is further contended that the appellant, if he had any
grievance against the impugned order, he ought to have sought the review. On
these contentions, the respondent No.4 seeks dismissal of appeal.
6\. Considered the rival submissions.
7\. The foremost question is, whether it will be within the jurisdiction of
the Division Bench in seisin with an intra-court appeal against the order
impugned, to examine its correctness ?
8\. The intra-court appeal is governed by the Madhya Pradesh Uchcha Nyayalaya
(Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005, which is an Act providing an
appeal from a judgment or order passed by one Judge of the High Court in
exercise of the original jurisdiction, to a Division Bench of the same High
Court. Sub- section (1) of Section 2 of the Adhiniyam provides for that "an
appeal shall lie from a judgment or order passed by one Judge of the High
Court in exercise of original jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, to a Division Bench comprising of two  7 WA-545-2020
Judges of the same High Court." The proviso stipulates that "no such appeal
shall lie against an interlocutory order or against an order passed in
exercise of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India."
9\. The expression "original jurisdiction" in the context of exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India came up for
consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji
vs State of Gujarat (2015) 9 SCC 1 wherein, relying on its earlier decision in
State of U.P. vs Vijay Anand Maharaj AIR 1963 SC 946, it is held :
> 9\. In this context, we may usefully refer to another Constitution Bench
> decision in State of Uttar Pradesh and others v. Dr. Vijay Anand Maharaj AIR
> 1963 SC 946, wherein it has been ruled :
> "9. Article 226 confers a power on a High Court to issue the writs, orders,
> or directions mentioned therein for the enforcement of any of the rights
> conferred by Part III or for any other purpose. This is neither an appellate
> nor a revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. Though the power is not
> confined to the prerogative writs issued by the English Courts, it is
> modelled on the said writs mainly to enable the High Courts to keep the
> subordinate tribunals within bounds."
> 10\. After so stating, the larger Bench referred to the decision in Hamid
> Hassan v. Banwarilal Roy AIR 1947 PC 90 wherein the Privy Council had
> observed that the  8 WA-545-2020 original civil jurisdiction which the
> Supreme Court of Calcutta had possessed over certain classes of persons
> outside the territorial limits of that jurisdiction was a matter of original
> jurisdiction. Thereafter, the Court referred to certain High Court decisions
> and opined : (Vijay Anand Maharaj case, AIR p. 951, para 9) "9. .... It is,
> therefore, clear from the nature of the power conferred under Article 226 of
> the Constitution and the decisions on the subject that the High Court in
> exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution exercises
> original jurisdiction, though the said jurisdiction shall not be confused
> with the ordinary civil jurisdiction of the High Court. This jurisdiction,
> though original in character as contrasted with its appellate and revisional
> jurisdictions, is exercisable throughout the territories in relation to
> which it exercises jurisdiction and may, for convenience, be described as
> extraordinary original jurisdiction. If that be so, it cannot be contended
> that a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is a continuation of
> the proceedings under the Act."
10\. A Full Bench of our High Court in Jaidev Siddha (Dr.) and others vs
Jaiprakash Siddha and others 2007 (3) MPLJ 595 had an occasion to examine the
expression "in exercise of its original jurisdiction" appearing in sub-section
(1) of Section 2 of the Adhiniyam, 2005, wherein it is held that the
jurisdictional perspective in the constitutional context are to be examined
and that  9 WA-545-2020 Section 2 of the Act cannot be given a restricted and
constricted meaning.
11\. Further, the Five Judges Bench of our High Court in Manoj Kumar vs Board
of Revenue I.L.R. (2007) M.P. 1504 held :
> "65. .... It has to be borne in mind that the power of the High Court under
> Article 226 of the Constitution are not confined to prerogative writs
> inasmuch as it can issue directions, orders, writs and can mould the relief
> to meet the peculiar requirements. The powers conferred on the High Court
> under the said Article is of wide expanse'. In Director of settlements, A.P.
> vs M.R. Apparao (2002) 4 SCC 638, it has been held that the power under
> Article 226 is essentially a power upon the High Court for issuance of high
> prerogative writs for enforcement of fundamental rights as well as non-
> fundamental or ordinary legal rights, which may come within the expression
> 'for any other purposes'. The powers of the High Courts under Article 226
> though are discretionary and no limits can be placed upon their discretion
> they must be exercised along the recognised lines and subject to certain
> self-imposed restrictions. It is a constitutional power conferred on the
> High Court to see no man is subject to injustice by violation of law. In
> exercise of this Article the High Court is expected to erase injustice and
> not to make justice a by- product."
10
> WA-545-2020
> 12\. The question is, as to what will be scope of intra-court appeals which
> are directed against the judgment and order of a Single Judge passed in
> exercise of its original jurisdiction ?
13\. It must be remembered that the exercise of powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution are discretionary and no limits can be placed upon their
discretion. However, the discretion must be exercised along the recognized
lines and subject to certain self- imposed restrictions. If such a decision is
shown to have been exercised arbitrarily or capriciously or perversely or
where the Court had ignored the settled principle of law, then in that case,
it will be within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court, in an intra- court
appeal, to interfere with the exercise of such discretionary power by the
court of first instance. In this context, reference can be had of the decision
in Wander Ltd. vs Anton India Pvt. Ltd. 1990 (Suppl) SCC 727, wherein it is
observed :
> "14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of
> discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the Appellate Court will
> not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance
> and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown
> to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where
> the court had ignored the settled principles of law  11 WA-545-2020
> regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against
> exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle."
> (Emphasis added)
> 14\. Furthermore, in the case of Baddula Lakshmiah vs Sri Anjaneya Swami
> Temple (1996) 3 SCC 52, it is held that, in an intra-court appeal, the
> appellate Court is a Court of Correction which corrects its own orders, in
> exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Judge. Such is
> not an appeal against an order of subordinate court. In such appellate
> jurisdiction the High Court exercises the powers of a Court of Error. :
> "2. .... A letters patent appeal, as permitted under the Letters Patent, is
> normally an intra-court appeal whereunder the Letters Patent Bench, sitting
> as a Court of Correction, corrects its own orders in exercise of the same
> jurisdiction as was vested in the Single Bench. Such is not an appeal
> against an order of a subordinate court. In such appellate jurisdiction the
> High Court exercises the powers of a Court of Error. So understood, the
> appellate power under the Letters Patent is quite distinct, in contrast to
> what is ordinarily understood in procedural language."
> (Emphasis supplied)  12 WA-545-2020
> 15\. Recently, following the principle of law laid down in Wander Ltd.
> (supra), it is observed by their Lordship in Wockhardt Limited vs Torrent
> Pharmaceuticals Limited (2018) 18 SCC 346, that it will be within the
> jurisdiction of Division Bench to interfere on a matter of principle,
> pointing out errors of law by the Single Judge :
> 10\. We are of the view that this is not a case where Wander Ltd. (supra)
> has not been heeded. On the contrary, the Division Bench has interfered on a
> matter of principle, pointing out errors of law by the learned Single Judge.
> ..."
> 16\. In view whereof, the contention raised on behalf of the respondent No.4
> that it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in intra-court
> appeal to examine the correctness of an order of reference, cannot be
> countenanced. In our considered opinion, in view of the law laid down in
> Baddula Lakshmiah (supra), Wander Ltd. (supra) and Wockhardt Limited
> (supra), it will be within the jurisdiction of Division Bench in seisin with
> an intra-court appeal, to interfere on a matter of principle, pointing out
> error of law by the learned Single Judge. Our view also find support from
> the decision by the Constitution Bench in Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra  13
> WA-545-2020 Community vs State of Maharashtra (2005) 2 SCC 673; wherein,
> their Lordships, in a fact situation as the present one, were pleased to
> hold :
> "12. Having carefully considered the submissions made by the learned senior
> counsel for the parties and having examined the law laid down by the
> Constitution Benches in the abovesaid decisions, we would like to sum up the
> legal position in the following terms :
> (1) The law laid down by this Court in a decision delivered by a Bench of
> larger strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or co-equal
> strength. (2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot doubt the correctness of the
> view of the law taken by a Bench of larger quorum. In case of doubt all that
> the Bench of lesser quorum can do is to invite the attention of the Chief
> Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing before a Bench
> of larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has come up for
> consideration. It will be open only for a Bench of co-equal strength to
> express an opinion doubting the correctness of the view taken by the earlier
> Bench of co-equal strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for hearing
> before a Bench consisting of a quorum larger than the one which pronounced
> the decision laying down the law the correctness of which is doubted. (3)
> The above rules are subject to two exceptions : (i) The abovesaid rules do
> not bind the discretion of the Chief  14 WA-545-2020 Justice in whom vests
> the power of framing the roster and who can direct any particular matter to
> be placed for hearing before any particular Bench of any strength; and
> (ii) In spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the matter has already
> come up for hearing before a Bench of larger quorum and that Bench itself
> feels that the view of the law taken by a Bench of lesser quorum, which view
> is in doubt, needs correction or reconsideration then by way of exception
> (and not as a rule) and for reasons it may proceed to hear the case and
> examine the correctness of the previous decision in question dispensing with
> the need of a specific reference or the order of Chief Justice constituting
> the Bench and such listing. Such was the situation in Raghubir Singh (1989)
> 2 SCC 754 and Hansoli Devi (2002) 7 SCC 273."
> (Emphasis supplied)
> 17\. The objection raised as to jurisdiction is, therefore, overruled.
18\. Now, coming to the issue as to whether learned Single Judge was justified
in placing the matter before Hon'ble the Chief Justice to refer the matter to
a Larger Bench.
19\. For dealing with the question, we straightaway refer to the principle
laid down in Devi Singh Thakur (supra).
20\. In Devi Singh Thakur (supra), the Division Bench dwelt on the issue as to
whether a Sub-Divisional Officer (Police) can be said  15 WA-545-2020 to be
holding an "operational post" and thus, immune from transfer within two years
of his posting, which is a minimum tenure laid down in Prakash Singh vs Union
of India (2006) 8 SCC 1; wherein, it is held :
> "31. With the assistance of learned counsel for the parties, we have perused
> the various reports. In discharge of our constitutional duties and
> obligations having regard to the aforenoted position, we issue the following
> directions to the Central Government, State Governments and Union
> Territories for compliance till framing of the appropriate legislations :
> .....
> .....
> Minimum Tenure of I.G. of Police & other officers (3) Police Officers on
> operational duties in the field like the Inspector General of Police in-
> charge Zone, Deputy Inspector General of Police in-charge Range,
> Superintendent of Police in-charge district and Station House Officer in-
> charge of a Police Station shall also have a prescribed minimum tenure of
> two years unless it is found necessary to remove them prematurely following
> disciplinary proceedings against them or their conviction in a criminal
> offence or in a case of corruption or if the incumbent is otherwise
> incapacitated from discharging his responsibilities. This would be subject
> to promotion and retirement of the officer."
16
> WA-545-2020 ...... "
21\. It is pertinent to note that learned Single Judge, in Writ Petition
No.4461/2019 (S.N. Pathak vs State of M.P. and others) which gave rise to
appeal of Devi Singh Thakur (supra) relying on the decision of another Single
Bench in Writ Petition No.3287/2019 : Dr. Kripa Shankar Dwivedi vs State of
M.P. and others decided on 22.02.2019, held that the police officer holding
rank of City Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police/Sub-
Divisional Officers (Police) were on operational post.
22\. In Dr. Kripa Shankar Dwivedi (supra), learned Single Judge made following
observations while dwelling on the contention of the State that immunity of
transfer within two years of posting as per the verdict in Prakash Singh
(supra) was to officer on operational duties :
> 19\. The Ld. Additional Advocate General's submission that judgments cannot
> be read as statute, is appreciated in the correct prospective by this court.
> Undoubtedly, the judgments of superior courts are not to be interpreted as
> statutes. They are not to be considered as Euclidean theorem whereby a
> strict and a mechanical application of the judgments should be given effect
> to. Judgments of the Supreme Court elucidate the law where it interprets a
> 17 WA-545-2020 statute and in cases like Prakash Singh's prematurely if
> there is (1) disciplinary proceedings initiated against him, (2) he is
> convicted for a criminal offence, (3) there is a case of corruption pending
> against him, or (4) he is incapacitated from discharging his
> responsibilities. These four condition precedents, have been laid down by
> the Supreme Court after much deliberation. If the same is not followed in
> letter and spirit, then the protection given to the police officer on
> operational duties in the field will be rendered superfluous.
...
21\. The other contention of the Ld. Additional Advocate General that the
Petitioner being a Dy. SP was not "In- charge" either of a zone, range,
district or of a police station which, according to the Ld. Additional
Advocate General, is a condition precedent to be satisfied before the
protection of two years continuous service at the place of posting can be
accorded to the Petitioner. According to the Ld. Additional Advocate General,
the Petitioner being a Dy. SP, his position is in between a Station House
Officer and the Superintendent of Police of a district and, therefore, he does
not occupy a post where he is In-charge of any field operational duties. Yet
again, with great respect, this court begs to differ. Direction No.3 commences
with the words "police officers on operational duties in the field" even in
the position of a Dy. SP, the Petitioner was on operational duties in the
field and this  18 WA-545-2020 stands is established by the document filed by
the State itself in its reply, which is Annexure R/3 at page 12, which is a
list of fourteen cases in which notices have been given to the Petitioner. All
those cases relate to the conduct of the investigation in criminal cases by
the Petitioner. Investigation falls in the category of operational duties in
the field as it is not purely administrative. Therefore, even though the
Deputy Superintendent of Police and the SDO(P) have been omitted, by necessary
implication they were also police officers on operational duties in the field.
23\. These observations in Dr. Kripa Shankar Dwivedi (supra) were examined in
the light of the provisions contained in Madhya Pradesh Police Regulation
whereon, it was found that the CSP/DSP/SDO(P) were not involved in
"operational duties in field". It was, accordingly, held in Devi Singh Thakur
(supra) :
> "Evidently, the minimum tenure of two years is fixed for the Police officer
> on operational duties in the field like the Inspector General of Police in
> Change Zone, Deputy Inspector General of Police in Change Range,
> Superintendent of Police in Change District and Station House Officer in
> Change of Police Station. Thus, the SDO(P)/CSP; are kept out of the
> periphery as they are not in the operational duties in field. Though learned
> Single Judge in Dr. Kripa Shanker Dwivedi (supra) in paragraph 21, of the
> order therein has observed that the  19 WA-545-2020 Superintendent of Police
> being engaged in investigation therefore "by necessary implication they were
> also police officers on operational duties in the field." We, however,
> respectfully disagree with the observation. Firstly, the SDOPs/DSPs/CSPs,
> being omitted in paragraph 30 of the Judgment in Prakash Singh (supra)
> cannot be treated to be "cassus omisus", a well settled Rule of
> interpretation, unprovided for by a Statute. Applying the principle to a
> Judgment by a Superior Court by including the post by "necessary
> implication," is unwarranted. Even otherwise the Madhya Pradesh Police
> Regulation framed by the State Government in exercise of its powers
> conferred by sub-
Section (2) of Section 46 read with Section 2 and 7 of the Police Act, 1861,
lays down under Regulation 36 the duties and power of the Assistant
Superintendent of Police and Deputy Superintendent of Police. It envisages:
"36- A.S.P and D.S.P.- duties and power of- Assistant Superintendents and
Deputy Superintendents may do any of the Superintendent's work which he is not
obliged by law or rules to do personally. They may make inquiries and
recommendations about matter on which they are not empowered to pass final
orders. They should go on tours and make inspections. Assistant and Deputy
Superintendents who have been conformed in their appointments have been
empowered to perform the duties of a Superintendent under section 7 of the
Police Act, in so far as they relate to the suspension of police officers and
the award of the punishments specified in Section 7(b). All deputy
Superintendents except probationers are  20 WA-545-2020 empowered to perform
the duties of a Superintendent under Section 30 and 30-A of the Act."
Even Part VI Chapter I of the Regulation which deals with the Investigation of
Crime empowers the Police Officer-in-charge of Police Station to investigate
(Regulation 734), we are not apprised of any provision in regulation which
empowers the SDO(P)/CSP/DSP to investigate the crime. Therefore, they cannot
be treated as "on operational duties in fields." The contrary view taken in
(sic .....) cannot be held to be correct; therefore, overruled."
24\. It is this view which is doubted by learned Single Judge on the anvil of
stipulations contained in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and in the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules,
1995. Learned Single Judge noted the following submissions made on behalf of
the petitioner and respondent :
> "As per the learned counsel for the petitioner, the aforesaid provisions
> clearly indicate that the SDO(P)/DSP/CSP are the investigating officers as
> they investigate the matter under the provisions of Rules, 1995 and Act,
> 1988 and, as such, they are on operational duties.
This aspect has not been brought to the notice of the Division Bench,
therefore, the view of the Division Bench  21 WA-545-2020 is incorrect,
whereas the view taken by coordinate Bench in W.P. No.4461/2019 and also in
case of Dr. Kripa Shankar Dwivedi (supra), was proper. He also submits that
the Division Bench has held contrary to law, but he is relying upon the
decision of the Supreme Court which deals with the police officers who are on
operational duties and, therefore, the order impugned, according to him, is
contrary to law and is not sustainable. Accordingly, the impugned order
deserves to be set aside.
In the above facts situation of the case, the petitioner has also claimed for
grant of interim relief saying that the operation of the order of transfer in
respect of the petitioner, be stayed.
Per contra, Shri Seth appearing for respondent No.4 submits that even
otherwise while taking the said view, the Division Bench has not taken note of
specific provision of Rules 1995 so also the Act, 1988, but the view of
Division Bench is binding to this Court unless it is finally decided that the
view taken by the Division Bench is proper, therefore, this Court has no other
option, but to follow the view of the Division Bench. He has also submitted
that in compliance of the order of transfer, the petitioner has already been
relieved and respondent No.4 has submitted his joining and, therefore, no case
for grant of interim relief is made out. He further submits that so far as the
approval of transfer from the Police Establishment Board is concerned, at this
stage merely because the order  22 WA-545-2020 impugned is silent in that
regard, inference cannot be drawn that the same has been issued without the
approval of the Police Establishment Board.
Pursuant to a query made by this Court, the learned Government Advocate
appearing for the respondents /State after seeking instructions has apprised
this Court showing a document that the transfer of the petitioner has been
made on the basis of the recommendations of the Police Establishment Board,
therefore, the ground urged by the petitioner that the order impugned has been
issued without the recommendation of the Police Establishment Board, is
baseless."
\- and drew a prima facie opinion that "the petitioner being an SDO(P), is on
operational duty and, accordingly, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in
the case of Prakash Singh (supra) is applicable to him." Accordingly, the
transfer order was stayed. That, while agreeing with the petitioner's
contention that the decision in Devi Singh Thakur (supra), being structured on
defective foundation, learned Single Judge, contrary to what was held in Devi
Singh Thakur (supra), held the post of SDO(P) to be an operational post, then
referred the matter to Hon'ble the Chief Justice for placing it before a
Larger Bench. The question formulated is :  23
> WA-545-2020 'Whether the view taken by the Division Bench in case of Devi
> Singh Thakur vs S.N. Pathak and others (W.A. No.693/2019) holding that the
> SDO(P)/CSP/DSP are not on operational duties, therefore, the view taken by
> the Supreme Court in case of Prakash Singh (supra) would have no application
> for these police officers, is proper or not inasmuch as the provisions of
> Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Scheduled Castes and the
> Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 would prevail over
> the Police Regulations and therefore these officers should be treated as on
> operational duties in field.'
25\. Was this course proper is the question ?
26\. Rule 8 of Chapter IV of High Court of Madhya Pradesh Rules 2008
stipulates:
> "8. Reference to a Larger Bench "8. (1) A single bench or a division bench
> may refer any proceeding, pending before it. to the Chief Justice with a
> recommendation that it be placed before a larger bench where it involves a
> substantial question of law of general importance.
> (2) In such proceeding, the referring Judge(s) may formulate question(s) and
> may either refer such question
> (s) for opinion or may request that entire proceeding be heard and decided
> by the larger bench.
24
> WA-545-2020 (3) Where a Judge sitting alone while hearing a case is of the
> opinion that for the decision of that case, an earlier decision of
> coordinate or larger bench of this Court needs reconsideration, he may
> formulate question (s) and refer the same to the Chief Justice with a
> recommendation that it be placed before a larger bench."
27\. That, sub-rule (3) of Rule 8 of the Rules, 2008 came up for consideration
before Full Bench of our High Court in Farooq Mohammad vs. State of M.P. 2015
(4) MPLJ 450 wherein, it is held by their Lordships :
> "10. This legal position has been in vogue since then. Therefore, that legal
> position was not only binding on the Single Judge of this Court; but it was
> also not open to be doubted on the principles of stare decisis, in
> particular by the Single Judge. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
> in the case of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community and another vs.
> State of Maharashtra and another34 in paragraph 12 has observed thus:- "12.
> Having carefully considered the submissions made by the learned Senior
> Counsel for the parties and having examined the law laid down by the
> Constitution Benches in the abovesaid decisions, we would like to sum up the
> legal position in the following terms :-
> (1) The law laid down by this Court in a decision delivered by a Bench of
> larger strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal
> strength.
25
WA-545-2020 (2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or dissent from the
view of the law taken by a Bench of larger quorum. In case of doubt all that
the Bench of lesser quorum can do is to invite the attention of the Chief
Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing before a Bench of
larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has come up for consideration. It
will be open only for a Bench of coequal strength to express an opinion
doubting the correctness of the view taken by the earlier Bench of coequal
strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for hearing before a Bench
consisting of a quorum larger than the one which pronounced the decision
laying down the law the correctness of which is doubted. (3) The above rules
are subject to two exceptions : (i) The abovesaid rules do not bind the
discretion of the Chief Justice in whom vests the power of framing the roster
and who can direct any particular matter to be placed for hearing before any
particular Bench of any strength; and
(ii) in spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the matter has already
come up for hearing before a Bench of larger quorum and that Bench itself
feels that the view of the law taken by a Bench of lesser quorum, which view
is in doubt, needs correction or reconsideration then by way of exception (and
not as a rule) and for reasons given by it, it may proceed to hear the case
and examine the correctness of the previous decision in question dispensing
with the need of a specific reference or the order of the Chief Justice
constituting the Bench and such listing. Such was the situation in Raghubir
Singh and Hansoli Devi."
(emphasis supplied) Keeping in mind the principles underlying this decision,
it is not open to the learned Single Judge of the High Court to doubt the
correctness of the view expressed by the Division Bench as the decision of the
Division Bench is binding on the Single Judge.
....
26
WA-545-2020
20\. Following these decisions, the learned Single Judge should have eschewed
from referring the matter to the Larger Bench. We may now usefully refer to
Rule 8 in Chapter IV of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh Rules, 2008, in
particular, Clause 3 thereof, which reads thus:-
    "Reference to Larger Bench
    8. (1)        ........
       (2)        .........
       (3)        Where a Judge sitting alone while hearing a
case is of the opinion that for the decision of that case, an earlier decision
of coordinate or larger bench of this court needs reconsideration, he may
formulate question (s) and refer the same to the Chief Justice with a
recommendation that it be placed before a larger bench."
21\. The expression "reconsider" and "reconsideration as mentioned in The
Major Law Lexicon by P Ramanatha Aiyar, 4th Edition, read thus:-
"Reconsider. "Reconsider", as used in an Act, providing that, upon the return
by the mayor of a vetoed ordinance with his objection, the aldermen shall at
their regular meeting order the objection entered on the journal, after which
they shall proceed to re-consider the same, means the taking up of the matter
and discussing it. The word "re- consider" is not given the artificial meaning
which it may have acquired in strict parliamentary proceedings, but only the
ordinary meaning, which is to think or consider the matter over again, for the
purpose of passing upon the matter on such second consideration.
A resolution adopted by the city council that a certain ordinance theretofore
enacted "be reconsidered" does not amount to a repeal of such ordinance.
Reconsideration. Reconsideration, in parliamentary law, is defined to be
taking up for renewed consideration that which has been passed or acted on
previously."  27
> WA-545-2020
> 22\. Indeed, the learned Single Judge sitting alone while hearing a case is
> free to refer the decision of Coordinate or Larger Bench of this Court for
> reconsideration. The expression "reconsideration", will have special
> connotation when the Judge sitting alone while hearing a case doubts the
> opinion of a Division Bench. The Single Judge cannot opine that another view
> or opinion is possible; or that he disagrees with the decision of the
> Division Bench. Sensu stricto, in the light of the principles underlying the
> decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Central Board of
> Dawoodi Bohra Community and Anr. (supra), he can merely invite the attention
> of the Chief Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing
> before a larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has come up for
> consideration. At best, he may delineate the points which may require
> reconsideration, such as, that the Division Bench decision is per incuriam
> or has failed to refer to the settled legal position or any decision of the
> Supreme Court on the subject or for that matter the relevant statutory
> provisions of the Act or Rules have gone unnoticed."
28\. When the impugned order is tested on the anvil of above analysis, we are
of considered opinion that the same being contrary to the principle of law
laid down in Farooq Mohammed (supra) in respect of as to how the matter is to
be referred to a larger Bench, we set aside the order and remit the matter to
learned Single Judge. At this stage, a question arises as to whether when
apprised of the controversy qua the status of an SDO(P)/CSP/Dy. S.P., whether
this Court, in intra-court appeal, can decide the same. The answer, in our  28
WA-545-2020 considered opinion, is emphatic 'No'. That will be within the
domain of the reference Court in case of a reference made in accordance with
the law laid down in Farooq Mohammad (supra).
29\. The appeal is disposed of finally in above terms. No costs.
