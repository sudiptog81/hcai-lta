objections of the assessee are allowed.

PER N.K. SAINI, A.M:
The appeal of the Department and the cross objection by the assessee are
directed against the order dated 4.2.2014 of the ld. CIT(A)-XX, New Delhi. The
Department has raised the following grounds in its appeal:-
> ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 2 i. "Ld. CIT(A) had rejected the
> comparables / upward adjustment made by the AO / TPO and directed the AO to
> reject some comparables so that Arm's Length Margin comes within range of
> 5%.
> ii. Ld. CIT(A) had erred in allowing deduction amounting to Rs.
> 2,28,87,852/- u/s 10A of the Act.
> iii. The appellant craves for reserving the right to amend, modify, alter,
> add or forego any ground(s) of appeal at any time before or during the
> hearing or appeal."
2\. The grounds raised by the assessee in its cross objections are following:
> "1. That on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the
> CIT(A) erred in upholding the orders of the Assessing Officer (AO) /
> Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) which were arbitrary, bad in law and / or
> void ab initio.
> 1.1. That on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the AO /
> TPO have grossly erred in passing the order under section(s) 143(3) / 92CA
> of the Act, on non-existent (amalgamated) entity, namely, Heartland Delhi
> Transcription & Services Private Limited. Further, CIT(A) erred in upholding
> such order(s).
> 2\. That that CIT(A) erred on facts and in law in upholding the action of
> the AO, in invoking the provisions of Chapter X - Special Provisions
> relating to avoidance of tax of the Act, without appreciating that there
> would have been not profit shifting from India.
> 3\. That the CIT(A) erred on facts and in law in upholding the order of the
> AO / TPO in modifying filters and / or comparables' set adopted by the
> Assessee in its transfer pricing study.
> 4\. That the CIT(A) erred on facts and in law in upholding the order of the
> AO / TPO in selecting companies with high turnover and / or intellectual
> property rights, as comparable to the Assessee, such as:
> i. Infosys BPO Limited;
> ii. Wipro Limited iii. HCL Comnet Systems & Services Limited; and iv. Aditya
> Birla Minacs Worldwide Ltd.
> 5\. That the CIT(A) erred on facts and in law upholding the order of the AO
> / TPO in selecting functionally different companies as comparable to the
> Assessee, such as, i. Bodhtree Consulting Limited;
> ii. Informed Technologies India Limited; and iii. Apex Knowledge Solutions.
> ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 3
> 6\. That the CIT(A) erred on facts and in law in upholding the order of the
> AO / TPO in selecting company with abnormal profit margin, namely, Iservices
> India Private Limited.
> 7\. That the CIT(A) erred on facts and in law, in not allowing adjustment on
> account of difference in working capital and / or risk assumed by the
> Assessee vis a vis the comparable companies.
3\. From the above grounds, it is gathered that the grievance of the assessee
relates to the upholding of the assessment order passed by the AO u/s 143(3) /
92 CA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') on
the non-existent amalgamated entity instead of amalgamating company.
4\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee filed its return of
income on 31.10.2007 declaring an income of Rs. 1,87,762/- which was processed
u/s 143(1) of the Act. Later on, the case was selected for scrutiny. Since
there were international transactions, the AO referred the matter to the TPO
u/s 92 CA of the Act. The TPO proposed the adjustment on account of Arm's
Length Price. Accordingly, the AO enhanced the income by Rs. 1,54,79,764/- in
the draft assessment order. The AO framed the assessment u/s 144 C / 143(3) of
the Act and determined the arm's length price of back office to the medication
prescription services at Rs. 16,93,17,347/- as against the book value of those
international transactions declared by the assessee at Rs. 15,38,37,583/-.
Accordingly the addition of Rs. 1,54,79,764/- was made and assessment was
framed at an income of Rs. 3,85,65,380/- by making transfer pricing adjustment
and disallowance of deduction u/s 10A of the Act amounting to Rs.
2,28,87,852/-.
5\. Being aggrieved the assessee carried the matter before the learned CIT(A)
who sustained the addition made by the AO on account of Transfer Pricing
Adjustment amounting to 1,54,79,764/- and deleted the disallowance of
deduction u/s 10A of the Act amounting to Rs. 2,28,87,852/-.
ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 4
6\. Now the Department is in appeal against the relief allowed and the
assessee has filed the cross objection challenging the validity of the
assessment order passed by the AO on the non-existent (amalgamated entity)
namely M/s Heartland Information and Consultancy Services Pvt. Ltd. The
learned counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee company was
amalgamated with M/s Heartland Information and Consultancy Services Pvt. Ltd.,
Bangalore (HICS) and in this regard letter dated 19th October, 2008 was filed
with the AO informing him that pursuant to the order dated 25.07.2008 of the
Hon'ble High Court at New Delhi, M/s Heartland Delhi Transcription and
Services Pvt. Ltd. (HDTS) has amalgamated with M/s Heartland Information and
Consultancy Pvt. Ltd. (HICS), a certified copy of the order of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court was filed with the Registrar of companies on 17th September,
2008\. It was stated that M/s HDTS has ceased to exists i.e. dissolved without
binding up and HICS has taken over the assessee's liabilities,
responsibilities and obligations. It was further stated that aforesaid
information was also given to the TPO and the ld. CIT(A)-4, Delhi vide letters
of the even dates. Our attention was drawn towards page nos. 900 to 907 of the
assesee's paper book which are the copies of the said letters written to the
respective authorities. It was further submitted that the assessment has been
framed by the AO on the erstwhile amalgamated company i.e. M/s Heartland Delhi
Transcription and Services Pvt. Ltd. (HDTS) vide order dated 22.2.2011, on the
said date the said company was not in existence, therefore, assessment framed
was void ab initio. The reliance was placed on the following case laws:-

8\. DCIT vs. Satwat Exports Pvt. Ltd (ITA No. 5963/D/2013) (Del- Trib.)
7\. In his rival submissions, the learned DR strongly supported the order of
the learned CIT(A) and further submitted that the assessee did not raise the
objections either before the AO or before the learned CIT(A) and participated
in the assessment proceedings, therefore, in view of the provisions contained
in Section 292 B of the Act, the assessee has no right to challenge the
validity of the assessment at this stage.
8\. We have considered the submissions of both the parties and perused the
material available on the record. In the present case, it is an admitted fact
that the assessee M/s Heartland Delhi Transcription and Services Pvt. Ltd.
(HDTS) amalgamated with M/s Heartland Information and Consultancy Pvt. Ltd.
(HICS) in pursuant to the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court dated 25th
July, 2008 and this fact was brought to the notice of the AO (Income Tax
Officer, Ward-12 (3), Director of Income Tax, TP-1, New Delhi, Additional
Commissioner of Income Tax-12 New Delhi and Commissioner of Income Tax - 4,
New Delhi vide separate letters each dated 19th October, 2008 copies of which
are placed at page 900 to 907 of the assessee's paper book and order of the
Hon'ble Delhi High Court dated 25th July, 2008 for the aforesaid amalgamation
is placed at page no. 908 to 918 of the assessee's paper book. It is also
noticed that the AO referred the matter u/s 92 CA of the Act of the
amalgamated company M/s (HDTS) to the TPO who passed the order dated
25.10.2010 on the aforesaid entity. The AO also passed the assessment order
dated 22.2.2011 u/s 144C / 143(3) of the Act on the aforesaid entity i.e. HDTS
which amalgamated in HICS, therefore, it is crystal clear that the entity M/s
ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 6 (HDTS) was not in existence when
the TPO as well as the AO passed their respective order.
9\. On a similar issue, the ITAT Delhi Bench I-1, New Delhi having the same
combination passed a detailed order authored by the AM in the case of Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. vs. Dy. CIT reported in (2016) 72 taxmann.com. 164. and the
relevant findings have been given as under:-
> "10. We have considered the submissions of both the parties and carefully
> gone through the material le on the record. In the present case, it is an
> admitted fact that the amalgamating company M/s Powertrain India Ltd.
> amalgamated with M/s Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. w.e.f. 01.04.2012, as a of
> scheme of amalgamation duly approved by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide
> order dated 2013 and the assessment in this has been framed by the AO vide
> order dated 03.03.2015. Therefore, dear that when the assessment order was
> passed on 03.03.2015, M/s Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd. lot inexistence. It
> is also noticed that the aforesaid fact was in the knowledge of the
> department as the informed vide various letters mentioned in para 5 of the
> former part of this order which were to the various Tax Authorities.
> However, the AO in spite of knowing this fact that M/s Suzuki in India Ltd.
> amalgamated with M/s Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., made the reference to the TPO
> and -sued the notice dated 07.11.2014 to the non-existent entity i.e. M/s
> Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd.
> 11\. A similar issue the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court in the case of
> Micra India (P.) Ltd. {supra) under:
> "In the instant case, no doubt there was participation during the course of
> assessment; however, the Assessing Officer, despite being told that the
> original company was no longer in existence, did not Le remedial measures
> and did not transpose the transferee as the company which had to be
> assessed, instead, he resorted to a peculiar procedure of describing the
> original assessee as the one in existence; order also mentioned the
> transferee's name below that of assessee's company. Now, that did not to the
> assessment being completed in the name of the transferee-company. According
> to the sing Officer, the assessee- company was still in existence. Clearly,
> this was a case where the assesssment was contrary to law, as having being
> completed against a non-existent company. The Tribunal's decision is, in the
> circumstances, justified and warranted."
> 12\. Similarly, the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court in the case of Spice
> Infotainment Ltd. v. CIT [IT Nos. 475 & 476 of 2011, dated 3-8-2011] held as
> under:
> "No doubt, M/s Spice was an assessee and as an incorporated company and was
> in existence when it the returns in respect of two assessment ITA No.
> 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 7 years in question. However, before the
> case could be ted for scrutiny and assessment proceedings could be
> initiated, M/s Spice got amalgamated with M Corp Pvt. Ltd. It was the result
> of the scheme of the amalgamation filed before the Company Judge of this
> Court which was dully sanctioned vide orders dated 11th February, 2004. With
> this amalgamation made effective from 1st July, 2003, M/s Spice ceased to
> exist. That is the plain and le effect in law. The scheme of amalgamation
> itself provided for this consequence, inasmuch as simultaneous with the
> sanctioning of the scheme, M/s Spice was also stood dissolved by specific of
> this Court. With the dissolution of this company, its name was struck off
> from the rolls Companies maintained by the Registrar of Companies. A company
> incorporated under the Indian Companies Act is a juristic person. It takes
> its birth and gets life with the incorporation. It dies with the dissolution
> as per the provisions of the Companies Act. It is trite law that on
> amalgamation, the amalgamating company ceases to exist in the eyes of law.
> In view of the aforesaid clinching position in law, it is difficult to
> digest the circuitious route adopted by the Tribunal holding that the
> assessment was in fact in the name of amalgamated company and there was only
> a procedural defect. After the sanction of the scheme on 11th April, 2004,
> the Spice ceased to exit w.e.f 1st July, 2003. Even if Spice had filed the
> returns, it became incumbent upon the Income tax authorities to substitute
> the successor in place of the said "dead person". When notice under Section
> 143 (2) was sent, the appellant/amalgamated company appeared and brought
> this fact to the knowledge of the AO. He, however, did not substitute the
> name of the appellant on record Instead, the AO made the assessment in the
> name of M/s Spice which was non-
> existing entity on that day. In such proceedings and assessment order passed
> in the name of M/s Spice would clearly be void such a defect cannot be
> treated as procedural defect. Mere participation by the appellant would be
> of no effect as there is no estoppel against law. "
It has been further held as under:
> "Once it is found that assessment is framed in the name of non-existing
> entity, it does not remain a procedural irregularity of the nature which
> could be cured by invoking the provisions of Section 292B. The framing of
> assessment against a non-existing entity/person goes to the root of the
> matter which is not a procedural irregularity but a jurisdictional defect as
> there cannot be any assessment against a 'dead per son'."
13\. In the present case also as the assessment was framed in the name of non-
existing entity i.e. M/s Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd. which amalgamated with
M/s Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and this irregularity was not curable. Therefore,
the assessment order passed by the AO in the name of non- existing entity was
void ab initio and deserves to be quashed, we order accordingly.
14\. On the present case, the contention of the Id. CIT DR was that the
assessment was rightly framed by the AO on the assessee who filed the return
ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 8 of income and when the income was
earned, it was inexistence. This controversy has been settled by the Hon'ble
Jurisdictional High Court in the case of CIT v. Dimension Apparels (P.) Ltd.
[2015] 370 ITR 288/[2014] 52 taxmann.com 356 (Delhi) wherein it has been held
as under:
> "Section 170(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, makes it clear that in the case
> of amalgamation, the assessment must be made on the successor (i.e., the
> amalgamated company). Section 176 which contains provisions pertaining to a
> discontinuation of business, does not apply to a case of amalgamation. The
> language of section 159 evidently only applies to natural persons and cannot
> be extended through a legal fiction, to the dissolution of companies. Once
> it is found that assessment is framed in the name of non-existing entity it
> does not remain a procedural irregularity of the nature which could be cured
> by invoking the provisions of section 292B. Participation by the amalgamated
> company in assessment proceedings would not cure the defect because "there
> can be no estoppels against law."
15\. In the present case also when the assessment was framed by the AO vide
order dated 29.12.2015 in the name of M/s Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd., the
said company had already amalgamated with M/s Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and
therefore, it was not inexistence. Moreover, it is clear from the provisions
of Section 170(2) of the Act that in the case of amalgamation, the assessment
must be made on the successor i.e. the amalgamated company and not on the
predecessor i.e. amalgamating company. Therefore, in the present case, the
assessment framed by the AO vide order dated 29.12.2015 on the amalgamating
company i.e. M/s Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd. which was not inexistence on the
date of passing the assessment order was not valid and as such the same is
quashed. Since we have allowed ground No. 1 of the assessee and assessment
order is quashed, therefore, no finding is given on the other issues raised by
the assessee."
10\. It is also relevant to point that the order of the ITAT in the case of
Maruti Suzuki Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT, Circle 16(1), New Delhi (Supra) has been
upheld by the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court vide order dated 4th
September, 2017 in the case of Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi
vs. Maruti Suzuki Private Ltd., (2017) 85.com 330 wherein it has been held as
under:-
> "The revenue has repeatedly brought the issue before the Court in a large
> number of cases where, in more or less identical circumstances, the
> Assessing Officer had passed the assessment order in the name of the entity
> that had ceased to exist as on the date of the assessment order. In many of
> these cases, as in the present case, the Assessing Officer, after mentioning
> the name of the Amalgamating Company as the assessee, mentioned below it the
> ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 9 name of the Amalgamated
> Company.
> The submission of revenue that under section 292B, the successor-in-
> interest is precluded from raising an objection if it has participated in
> the assessment proceedings was negatived in Spice Infotainment Ltd. v. CIT
> [2012] 247 CTR (Del.) 500 wherein it was held that once it was found that
> the assessment was framed in the name of a non-existent entity, it did not
> remain a procedural irregularity of the nature which could be cured by
> invoking the provisions of section 292-B.
> The legal position having been made abundantly clear, there is no hesitation
> in holding that impugned order passed by Tribunal does not require any
> interference The appeal is accordingly dismissed."
11\. Recently the Hon'ble Apex Court dismissed the SLP moved by the Department
in the case of M/s Spice Enfotainment Ltd. which has been followed in the
aforesaid referred case of M/s Maruti Suzuki Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT, vide order
dated 2nd November, 2017.
12\. In the present case also the assessment was framed by the AO on the non-
existent amalgamated company, not on the amalgamating company. Therefore, the
assessment framed was void ab initio and accordingly the same is quashed.
Since, we have quashed the assessment framed by the AO therefore no separate
finding is being given on the issues raised in the Departmental appeal.
13\. In the result, the appeal of the Department is dismissed and cross
objections of the assessee are allowed.

directed against the order dated 4.2.2014 of the ld. CIT(A)-XX, New Delhi. The
Department has raised the following grounds in its appeal:-
> ITA No. 2697/Del/2014  CO No. 163/Del/2017 2 i. "Ld. CIT(A) had rejected the
> comparables / upward adjustment made by the AO / TPO and directed the AO to
> reject some comparables so that Arm's Length Margin comes within range of
> 5%.
> ii. Ld. CIT(A) had erred in allowing deduction amounting to Rs.
> 2,28,87,852/- u/s 10A of the Act.
> iii. The appellant craves for reserving the right to amend, modify, alter,
> add or forego any ground(s) of appeal at any time before or during the
assessment framed was void ab initio and accordingly the same is quashed.
Since, we have quashed the assessment framed by the AO therefore no separate
finding is being given on the issues raised in the Departmental appeal.

objections of the assessee are allowed.
