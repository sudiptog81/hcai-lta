                            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                           CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2656             OF 2009

                                         JUDGMENT
Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT.
1\. Leave granted.
2\. Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a Division Bench of
the Orissa High Court allowing the writ petition filed by the respondent in
Writ Petition (C) No.8282/2004 dated 27.10.2005 and the order dated 10.1.2007
passed in the Review Petition No.13/2006 arising out of said writ petition.
2\. The background facts as highlighted by the appellants are as follows:
would include not only waste land containing trees, shrubs and pasture lands
but also any other class of lands declared by Government to be forest land.
This does not mean that before a piece of land could be said to be forest land
there would have to be a notification by the Government under the Act."
44\. In view of the aforesaid conclusions we are of the considered view that
the matter needs to be re-considered by the High Court.
45\. The High Court while re-hearing the matter shall also consider the effect
of the aforesaid observations of this Court, and various aspects highlighted
above.
46\. In the background of the massiveness of apparent fraud involved,
effective and participative role of officials of the State cannot be lost
sight of. Without their active and  23 effective participation manipulation of
records, tampering with documents could not have been possible. The State
would do well to persue the matter with seriousness to unravel the truth and
punish the erring officials and take all permissible actions (including
criminal action) against every one involved.
2\. The background facts as highlighted by the appellants are as follows:
The dispute relates to an alleged lease of 53.95 acres of land executed by
Hatapatta dated 25.1.1933 by erstwhile intermediaries i.e. Chakradhar
Mohapatra and Ramakrushna Mohapatra in favour of one Kamala Devi. The
respondent Harapriya Bishoi claimed to be the successor in interest of Kamala
Devi. Undisputedly, the alleged Hatapatta is an unregistered document. The
land is presently situated in the capital city of Bhubaneswar in the State of
Orissa. The purported Hatapatta described the land as being for permanent
cultivation but as per records or rights published in 1930-31 the land is
classified as "uncultivable" within Anabadi Land. The land is further
described as Jhudi jungle i.e. bushy forest. The estate of intermediaries
Chakradhar Mohapatra and Ramakrushna Mohapatra is vested in the State by
virtue of a Notification dated 1.5.1954 issued under Section 3 of the Orissa
Estate Abolition Act, 1951 (in short the `Act'). In respect of the land in
question the Orissa Estate Abolition Case 4 of 1970 was registered. Originally
the case was registered as OEA 18 of 1967 with OEA Collector, Cuttack. On
transfer of certain villages from Cuttack district to Puri District, the case
was transferred to OEA Collector, Bhubneshwar and was re-numbered as OEA Case
No.4 of 1970.
By order dated 6.1.1971 in the said OEA case the OEA Collector set aside the
disputed lease deed on the ground of not being genuine. The Collector found
that since the lands were lying fallow, the rent receipts were not genuine.
The Ekpadia or Zamabandi Register in the Tahsil Officer had no mention of
Kamala Devi as a lessee. The lease was unregistered even though vast tracts of
land were transferred. It was thus held that the lease deed was back dated and
was created with the object of defeating the purpose of the Act. The said
order dated 6.1.1971 was upheld by Additional District Magistrate, Puri by
order dated 28.5.1974.
Between the period 1962 to 1973 settlement proceedings were carried out under
the Orissa Survey and Settlement Act, 1958 (in short the `Settlement Act'). By
2 publication dated 6.12.1973, the State was recorded as the owner/title
holder of the entire land of 1056.8 acres under Khatian No.1076 of village
Gadakana of which the disputed land is a part. Further, by Revenue Department
Notification No.13699-EA-1- ND-1/74/R published in the Extraordinary Gazette
No.371 dated 18.3.1974, the Government of Orissa notified that the
intermediaries interest of all intermediaries in respect of all estates other
than those which have vested in the State have passed to and became vested in
the State free from all encumbrances.
The order dated 28.5.1974 was challenged before the Orissa High Court by
filing OJC No.882 of 1974. The High Court by order dated 29.10.1976 directed
the OEA Collector, Bhubneshwar to examine the matter afresh by issuing notice
to the lessor and the lessee and also to ensure that the interest of the State
was protected. Pursuant to the order of the High Court dated 29.10.1976
remanding the matter to the OEA Collector, the Collector heard the matter
afresh and by order dated 24.4.1989 held that the lease was entered into prior
to 1.1.1946. But he found that the claimant was only in possession of 7 acres
of land and hence recommendation was made only for registering a settlement in
respect of such 7 acres of land. Significantly, the General Administration
Department (in short GA Department) was not brought on record in the
proceedings. The record was then submitted to the Board of Revenue. By order
dated 27.4.1991, the Board of Revenue held that due enquiry had not been made
as per the orders of the High Court in the earlier writ petition and the
matter was returned to the Collector for fresh enquiry. Interestingly, the
order of OEA Collector dated 24.4.1989 was challenged in OJC 2063 of 1992 in
the High Court. There was, however, no challenge to the order passed by the
Board of Revenue dated 27.4.1991. By order dated 2.11.1992 the High Court
allowed the writ petition being of the view that the finding of the Collector
was to the effect that the lease was not executed after 1.1.1946, so as to
defeat the provisions of the Act. Therefore,  3 the OEA Collector had no
jurisdiction to proceed further in the matter. Thus (a) the determination of
the extent of possession of the parties and (b) referral of the matter to the
Board of Revenue was beyond jurisdiction of the Collector. The High Court
quashed the order of the Collector directing settlement of portion of the
leased property and declared the proceedings before the Board of Revenue to be
non est. The High Court confined its order only to issue of jurisdiction and
the scope of power under Section 5(i) and there was no finding recorded
regarding the genuineness of the lease dated 25.1.1933. Additionally, the GA
Department of the State which is the relevant Department under the Orissa
Government Rules of Business was not a party in the writ petition.
After the death of Kamala Devi, her purported successor Kishore Chandra
Pattnaik filed a writ petition bearing No.OJC 15984 of 1997 praying for a
direction to the State to accept rent in respect of the disputed property.
Again, the GA Department was not arrayed as a party in the case at the time of
filing of the writ petition. The GA Department was later arrayed as a party
pursuant to the order dated 3.8.2000 passed in said OJC. One Anup Kumar
Dhirsamant who was the Power of Attorney holder of Kishore Chandra Pattnaik
executed a sale deed dated 6.3.2000 covering 23.30 acres of land on behalf of
the latter in favour of the present respondent who is also the mother of
Dhirsamant. Thus, the respondent came into the picture as a vendee of Kishore
Chandra Pattnaik who in turn is the son of Kamala Devi. Kishore Chandra
Pattnaik claimed that the original power of attorney did not empower the
holder to sell the land. His plea was that the aforesaid sale was in pursuance
of a forged and interpolated document. The sale deed dated 6.3.2000 was an
impounded document for evasion of stamp duty. On 8.4.2002, a Settlement Rent
Objection case under the Settlement Act 4 bearing case No.4013 of 2002 was
instituted by the Assistant Settlement Officer, Gadakna on the strength of the
petition filed by GA Department for recording the case land in favour of GA
Department. The petition was allowed on 30.12.2002 in favour of the GA
Department. Against the said order, Settlement Appeal cases were preferred by
Kishore Chandra Pattnaik and present respondent Harapriya Bisoi. The appeals
were disposed of by order dated 7.10.2004 and the record of rights in favour
of GA Department was directed not to be interfered with. The respondent also
filed a Civil Suit bearing No.2/12 of 2004 before learned Civil Judge, Senior
Division, Bhubaneswar, for a declaration of right, title and interest in
respect of disputed land. The IAs were dismissed and the Civil Court held that
the right, title and interest of the present respondent had not been
determined finally by OJC 2063 of 1992. It was held that the findings of the
High Court related only to the power and jurisdiction of the Collector and the
Board of Revenue. Respondent filed OJC 8282 of 2004 seeking a direction to the
State to accept rent from her in respect of the case land, for a declaration
of tenancy in her favour and for an injunction against the State restraining
them from interfering with her possession. By order dated 27.10.2005 the High
Court allowed the writ petition and that is the subject matter of challenge in
one of the present appeals.
It is to be noted that in its order dated 27.10.2005 the High Court relied
upon the earlier judgment in OJC 2063 of 1992 and held that in view of the
finding in that case Kamala Devi and Kishore Chandra Pattnaik were deemed to
be tenants under the State government under Section 8(1) of the Act and the
present respondent being successor in interest of Kamala Devi was to step into
her shoes and has to be treated as a tenant under the Act. The relevant
findings of the High Court in the judgment are as follows: "(i) In paras 10
and 11 of the judgement of the High Court in OJC No. 2063/1992 it was held
that the lease deed having been executed prior to 1.1.1946  5 and the same
have been found to be a genuine document, the OEA Collector could not have
proceeded with the case any further and he should have dropped the proceeding.
(ii) In the subsequent paras in the judgment in OJC No. 2063/1992, the Court
held that the OEA Collector had no jurisdiction to decide the question of
actual possession and make a recommendation to the Board of Revenue for
concurrence. "The orders passed by the Board of Revenue in pursuance of the
references of the case by the OEA Collector shall be taken to be non-est. The
proceedings initiated under S. 5 (i) of the OEA Act shall be taken to have
been dropped."
(iii) This Court while disposing of the earlier writ application taking note
of S. 5
(i) has held that Late Kamla Devi was a tenant under the ex-intermediaries
before the vesting and on the date of vesting and was in possession of the
entire disputed property - hence Late Kamla Devi was a deemed tenant under S.
8 (1) of the OEA Act.
(iv) In view of the decision of the High Court in OJC No. 2063/1992, late
Kamla Devi and thereafter her successor Kishore Chandra Pattnaik are deemed to
be tenants under the State Government and therefore the Tahasildar,
Bhubaneswar was duty bound to collect rent from them.
(v) Kishore Chandra Pattaik being deemed to be a tenant under the State
Government, the, Petitioner, Harpriya Bishoi, has stepped into his shoes after
purchasing the land from him and, consequently, the Petitioner is to be
treated as a tenant under the State and rent is to be collected from her."
4\. In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the State submitted that
the High Court has completely mis-construed the decision in OJC 2063 of 1992.
In the said judgment the High Court had not returned any finding or expressed
any observation with regard to the genuineness of the lease deed of 1933. The
only issue before the High Court was whether the OEA Collector had exercised
its powers correctly under Section 5(i) of the Act. No further issue was under
consideration of the High Court. Only the scope and jurisdiction of the
Collector and the Board of Revenue was decided. In the said decision the High
Court had not returned any finding that late Kamala Devi was a tenant under
the ex-intermediaries before the vesting and on the date of vesting and was in
possession of the entire disputed property. The High Court has erroneously
recorded the said finding in the impugned judgment. Therefore, the High Court
was in  6 error by holding that Kamala Devi and thereafter her successor
Kishore Chandra Pattnaik were deemed to be tenants under Section 8(1) of the
Act. It is pointed out that the proceedings in OEA Case No.4 of 1970 were
under Section 5(i) of the Act and not under Section 8(1) of the Act. Neither
the order of OEA Collector in OEA Case No.4 of 1970 dated 24.4.1989 nor the
High Court's order in OJC 2063 of 1992 recognizes the predecessors in interest
of the respondent as tenants under Section 8(1) of the Act. The OEA Collector
had categorically held in the order dated 24.4.1989 that the plea of the
claimants that the proceedings to be treated as one under Section 8(1) does
not hold water. The OEA Collector was therefore conscious of the fact that
there was no exercise of power under Section 8(1) of the Act, but only under
Section 5(i) of the Act. Further, the High Court was in error in its
interpretation of Section 5(i) of the Act. The settlement of the lease in
favour of the lessee under the first proviso of Section 5(i) has to be
necessarily confirmed by a member, Board of Revenue.
5\. It has also been highlighted that a decision of this Court in State of
Orissa v. Brundaban Sharma (1995 Supp (3) SCC 249) has been completely lost
sight of. The conceptual different between Section 5(i) of the Act and Section
8 has been lost sight of. It was clearly observed in Brundaban's case (supra)
that the order of the Collector under Section 5(i) of the Act is required to
be confirmed by Board of Revenue even if Collector upholds genuineness of the
lease. Several gross acts of fraud have been committed by the respondent
and/or others involved. This clearly invalidates every action. The vendor's
claims are pending adjudication before various courts. The record of rights
has attained finality in the settlement proceedings and the High Court should
not have unsettled them in the manner done. Therefore, it is submitted that
the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be maintained.
7
6\. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that
consequences of vesting and the finding of the Collector that the lease was
prior to 1.1.1946 and is a genuine one has been confirmed in the earlier
judgment. The same has attained finality. The State of Orissa was represented
by the Secretary to Government, Revenue Department, Bhubneshwar and the
Member, Board of Revenue was also a party. It is submitted that the decision
in Brundaban's case (supra) was rendered in a different set up and has no
application to the facts of the present case.
7\. Certain factors need to be noted in the present case.
8\. In Brundaban's case (supra) this Court held that even in a case where the
OEA Collector "decides not to set aside the lease, he should have referred the
case to the Board of Revenue. The object of conferment of such power on the
Board of Revenue appears to be to prevent collusive or fraudulent acts or
actions on the part of the intermediaries and lower level officers to defeat
the object of the Act." This Court further held that even if the OEA Collector
decides that a lease was purported to have been granted before 1.1.1946 and is
not liable to be set aside, without reference or confirmation by the Board of
Revenue, such lease would not attain finality The judgment finally concludes
that, "the' order passed by the Tehsildar (exercising powers as the OEA
Collector) without confirmation by the Board is non est. A non est order is a
void order and it confers no title and its validity can be questioned or
invalidity be set up in any proceeding or at any stage."
9\. It is important to note, that in the facts of the present case, the
Member, Board of Revenue in its order dated 27.4.1991 while considering the
decision of the OEA Collector in OEA Case No. 4 of 1970, had observed that a
detailed enquiry had not been  8 made by the OEA Collector "to ascertain who
was in possession of the case land prior to 1.1.1946 and from 1.1.1946 to
1.5.1954 (date of vesting of estate) and thereafter". The Member, Board of
Revenue, had further stated that, "the OEA Collector should have verified the
records to ascertain who were the ex-intermediaries (lessors) and if they had
right to alienate the land and if they have got compensation u/ s 28 of the
OEA Act". Further, "the O.Ps did not press their claim for a considerable
period of time" and "after notice was published in the newspaper 'Prajatantra'
dated 22.7.87, a number of interveners have preferred their claims before the
OEA Collector", who have not been examined.
10\. The Member, Board of Revenue in its order had concluded that, "the case
land are within Bhubaneswar Municipality where the capital of state has been
established and a number of Government institutions have developed.. In view
of the above points it is necessary on the part of the OEA Collector to
conduct a detailed enquiry".
11\. Without such confirmation by Member, Board of Revenue, the order of the
OEA Collector had not attained finality, and hence, the lease deed in favour
of Kamala Devi did not attain finality.
12\. Certain provisions of the Act need to be noted.
13\. Section 2(h) defines an `intermediary' as follows:
> "Intermediary' with reference to any estate means a proprietor, sub-
> proprietor, landlord, land holder, malguzar, thikadar, gaontia, tenure-
> holder, under-tenure holder and includes an inamdar, a jagirdar, Zamindar,
> Illaquedar, Khorposhdar, Parganadar, Sarbarakar and Maufidar including the
> ruler of an Indian State merged with the State of Orissa and all other
> holders or owners of interest in land between the raiyat and the State."
9
14\. Section 2(hh) defines as `intermediary interest' as an estate or any
rights or interest therein held or owned by or vested in an Intermediary.
15\. Significantly, as the above definitions would show, an `intermediary' and
an `intermediary interest' cover all the holders or owners of interest in land
between the State and the 'Raiyat' i.e. the actual cultivator or tiller of the
soil. This is in line with the object and purpose of the 1951 Act i.e. to
establish a direct relationship between the tiller and the State, and to
abolish all intermediary interests, by whatever name called.
16\. `Raiyat' is the actual tiller of the soil, and is defined in section 2(n)
as:
> 'Raiyat' means any person holding the land for the purpose of cultivation
> and who has acquired the right of occupancy according to the tenancy law or
> rules for the time being in force in that area or in the absence of such law
> or rules, the custom prevalent in that area.
17\. Section 3 of the Act empowers the State to declare,, by notification,
that the estate specified in the notification has passed to and become vested
in the State free from all encumbrances. In similar vein, Section 3A empowers
the State to declare by notification that the intermediary interests of all
intermediaries or a class of intermediaries in the whole or part of the estate
have passed to and become vested in the State free from all encumbrances.
18\. Upon a notification being issued under the provisions of Sections 3, 3A
or 4 of the Act, the entire estate vests in the State free from encumbrances
and the intermediary ceases to have any interest in such estate other than the
interests expressly saved under the Act.  10 Where a lease or transfer has
been made prior to 1.1.1946, solely with the object of defeating the
provisions of the Act or to claim higher compensation, Section 5(i) empowers
the collector to set aside such lease, settlement or transfer and take
possession of the land from such person.
19\. By virtue of Section 8, any person who immediately before the vesting of
an estate in the State government was in possession of any holding as a tenant
under an intermediary, would on the from the date of the vesting, be deemed to
be a tenant of the State government. The words 'holding as a tenant' mean the
`Raiyat' and not any other class of tenant: Reference in this regard may be
drawn to the definition of `holding' in the Orissa Tenancy Act, 1913.
`Holding' means a parcel or parcels of land held by a raiyat and forming the
subject of a separate tenancy".
20\. Section 8 thus confers protection only on the `Raiyat' i.e. the actual
tiller of the soil.
21\. Significantly, a `lease' and `lessee' on the one hand are defined
separately from the 'Raiyat' under the Act. Thus, the mere execution of a
lease by the intermediary in favour of a person would not confer the status of
a 'raiyat' on the lessee nor would protect the possession of such lessee under
Section 8. In fact, a `lease' would amount to a transfer of an interest of the
intermediary in the land to the lessee. In such a situation, far from being a
tenant protected under Section 8, the lessee would in fact step into the shoes
of the intermediary with his interest being liable for confiscation and his
entitlement limited to compensation from the State. On the other hand, for
protection under Section 8, one has to be a Raiyat cultivating the land
directly and having the rights of occupancy under the tenancy laws of the
State. Thus, a `lessee' who is not actually  11 cultivating the land i.e. who
is not a 'raiyat', would not be within the protection of Section 8 of the Act.
Section 2(h) of the Act in its residuary part states that `intermediary' would
cover all owners or holders of interest in land between the raiyat and the
State. In Kumar Bimal Chandra Sinha V. State of Orissa, (1963) 2 SCR 552, this
Court while considering the scope of the Act has held as follows:
> "the position in law is that `estate" includes the interest, by whatever'
> name called, of all persons, who hold some right in land between the State
> at the apex and the raiyat at the base. That is to say, the Act is intended
> to abolish all intermediaries and rent receivers and to establish direct
> relationship between the State, in which all such interests vest, after
> abolition under the Act, and the tillers of the soil."
22\. On the facts of the present case, it is clear that the land was not under
cultivation by Kamala Devi. As per the record of rights published in 1930-31,
the disputed land is classified as Anabadi Land i.e. uncultivable. The land is
further described in the records as Jhudi jungle, i.e. bush forest. In
addition, by order dated 6.1.1971 in OEA Case 4 of 1970, the OEA Collector,
Bhubaneshwar had found that the lands were lying fallow and were not in
physical possession of any person. The land thus not being cultivated, Kamala
Devi cannot prima facie be considered as a 'Raiyat' under the Act.
23\. It is the stand of the appellant-State that the 'Hatapatta' on the basis
of which Kamala Devi has claimed her title is an unregistered document.
Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short the `T.P. Act')
read with Section 17 of the India Registration Act, (in short the
`Registration Act') mandates that the conveyance of title through a written
instrument of any immovable property worth more than Rs.100 for a period of
one year or more must be registered. If such an instrument is not registered
then Section 49 of the Registration Act read with Section 91 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 (in short the `Evidence Act') precludes the adducing of any
further evidence of the  12 terms and contents of such a document. [See Sri
Sita Maharani v. Chhedi Mahto (AIR 1955 SC 328). There is a further
requirement of registration of the instrument of conveyance/agricultural lease
under Sections 15 and 16 of the Orissa Tenancy Act, 1913 (in short the
`Tenancy Act').
24\. It is further submitted that even presuming that the 'Hatapatta' is legal
and valid, it would, make Kamla Devi a 'tenure-holder' as opposed to a
'raiyat'. Section 2(h) of the Act defines `intermediary' to include 'tenure-
holder'. Thus, a "tenure holder" being an "intermediary" under the Act- the
rights and liabilities of such tenure holder would stand extinguished under
the Act.
25\. According to the proviso to Section 5(5) of Tenancy Act where the area
held by the tenant exceeds 33 acres the tenant shall be presumed to be a
`tenure-holder' (which includes her successors-in-interest) until the contrary
is proved. As under the `Hatapatta', purportedly more than 53.95 acres of land
has been given by way of lease by the ex-intermediary to Kamala Devi, she or
her successor-in-interest is presumed to be a `tenure-holder' and, therefore,
an `intermediary' under the Act.
26\. It is highlighted by learned counsel for the appellant, as various claims
on prime government land in the city of Bhubaneswar have been surfacing on the
basis of fraudulent title papers (called 'Hatapattas') allegedly to have been
issued by ex-- intermediaries, the State Government in the General
Administration Department, has handed over the issue of fraudulent
'Hatapattas' to the Crime Branch, CID, Cuttack for inquiry and necessary legal
action vide Capital Police Station Case No.178/2005 dated 20.5.2005. An
interim report of the Inspector/CID-Crime Branch dated 31.8.2007 with respect
to the suit land has been submitted.
13
27\. The Crime Branch Report states that the Power of Attorney through which
the suit land has been sought to be alienated in favour of the Respondent
herein has been tampered and manipulated by the Power of Attorney holder, Anup
Kumar Dhirsamant, Managing Director, M/s Milan Developers & Builders (P) Ltd.
The vendor, Kishore Chandra Pattnaik had not given any powers of alienation to
his Power of Attorney holder Anup Kumar Dhirsamant. The respondent Harapriya
Bisoi is the mother of the Power of Attorney holder. The Crime Branch also
states that Anup Kumar Dhirsamant had interpolated the deed of Power of
Attorney giving himself powers to enter into a sale deed so as to be able to
alienate the property in favour of his mother, Harapriya Bisoi, the respondent
herein. The report concludes that prima facie offences u/s
420/468/471/477A/167/120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `IPC'),
inter-alia, have been made out against respondent Harapriya Bisoi and Anup
Kumar Dhirsamant.
28\. It has also come to light that the Sale Deed (RSD) No.1196/2000 dated
6.3.2000 executed in favour of Harapriya Bisoi, the Respondent herein, has
been impounded for non-payment of adequate stamp duty with the deficit stamp
duty and registration fee amounting to about Rs.1.03 crores.
29\. In Settlement Rent Objection Case No. 4013/2002 under the Settlement Act,
the Asst. Settlement Officer by its order dated 10.3.2003 had recorded the
suit land in favour of the G.A. Department.
30\. Thereafter, the Respondent filed Settlement Appeal Case, being Suit No.
205 of 2003, to set aside the above order. The Settlement Officer by its order
dated 7.10.2004 had dismissed the appeal holding that the draft. Record of
Rights in respect of the suit land shall not be interfered with. The officer
returned the following findings:  14 (1) On perusal of the impugned order
passed by the Asst. Settlement Officer in the said objection case it is
revealed that necessary field enquiry was made in presence of the parties.
(2) It is observed that there exists no such field/plot as found in the not
final map in respect of suit land relating to Hal Plot Nos. 7590 Ac 3.000,
7592 Ac.3.400, 7626 Ac 1.940 and 7646 Ac.5.000 - the map in respect of those
plots are imaginary.
(3) The land relating to Hal Plot No. 7646 Ac 5.000 have been allotted to
Sainik School since the year 1962-63 and comes under the premises of Sainik
School.
(4)The alleged possession of suit land by the appellant is found to be
disputed with others like Dijabar Behera S/o Bhima Behera and Golakh Behera
S/o Kesab Behera.
(5) Besides, an area of Ac 2.300 dec. out of the suit land i.e. Sabik Plot No.
4706 along with its adjoining land to the extent of Ac. 39.399 dec. have been
leased to the Government of India, Ministry of Railways, for the purpose of
construction of office and residential complex of East Coast Railway,
Bhubaneswar. It is also observed by the Asst. Settlement Officer that no
jamabandi in respect of the suit land has been opened in the Tahsil records.
(6) The Appellant adduced no evidence as regards to acquiring of right, title,
interest and possession over the suit land which is Government land as per the
finally published ROR of the year 1973-74.
(7) Creation of tenancy right in favour of the Appellant by way of deeming
provision u/ s 8 (1) of the Act has also not been recognized by the  15
Tahasildar, Cuttack/Bhubaneswar; the claim of possession by the appellant over
the suit land is not confirmed.
31\. In course of hearing of the appeals, a query was made as to what is the
effect of the order of the High Court in OJC 2063 of 1992 i.e. whether it
covers the area of 7 acres or the whole area of 53.95 acres of land. Learned
counsel for the respondent submitted that in view of the finding that the
order of the Collector was indefensible, obviously the right, title and
interest of the respondent extended to the whole area. This stand is clearly
unsustainable. The Collector's order only referred to certain enquires made to
confirm possession of only 7 acres of land. The High Court apparently has not
considered this aspect. The High Court has also not considered the effect of
alleged fraud and the fact that the relevant department was not a party in the
proceedings before the High Court in OJC 2063 of 1992.
32\. It is necessary to consider the effect of fraud.
33\. By "fraud" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from any
expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill will towards the
other is immaterial. The expression "fraud" involves two elements, deceit and
injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss,
that is, deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable or of money and
it will include and any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind,
reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary
loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always cause loss or
detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit
or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived, the
second  16 condition is satisfied. (See Dr. Vimla v. Delhi Administration
(1963 Supp. 2 SCR 585) and Indian Bank v. Satyam Febres (India) Pvt. Ltd.
(1996 (5) SCC 550).
34\. A "fraud" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing
something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to
gain by another's loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. (See
S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath (1994 (1) SCC 1).
35\. "Fraud" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice
never dwell together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which
includes the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand
as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is
also well settled that misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed,
innocent misrepresentation may also give reason to claim relief against fraud.
A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man
into damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on
falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which he
knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive from which
the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act of fraud on court
is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive
the rights of the others in relation to a property would render the
transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous. Although in a
given case a deception may not amount to fraud, fraud is anathema to all
equitable principles and any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated
or saved by the application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata.
(See Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi and Ors. (2003 (8) SCC 319).  17
36\. "Fraud" and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any
civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human
conduct. Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Milton's sorcerer, Comus, who
exulted in his ability to, `wing me into the easy hearted man and trap him
into snares'. It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In
Webster's Third New International Dictionary "fraud" in equity has been
defined as an act or omission to act or concealment by which one person
obtains an advantage against conscience over another or which equity or public
policy forbids as being prejudicial to another. In Black's Legal Dictionary,
"fraud" is defined as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of
inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing
belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a false representation of a
matter of fact whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading
allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed, which
deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to
his legal injury. In Concise Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as
criminal deception, use of false representation to gain unjust advantage;
dishonest artifice or trick. According to Halsbury's Laws of England, a
representation is deemed to have been false, and therefore a
misrepresentation, if it was at the material date false in substance and in
fact. Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines "fraud" as act
committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive another. From
dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud arises out of deliberate active
role of representator about a fact, which he knows to be untrue yet he
succeeds in misleading the representee by making him believe it to be true.
The representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with knowledge that it
was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry and Ors. v. Peek (1886-90) All
ER 1 what constitutes "fraud" was described thus: (All ER p. 22 B-C) "fraud"
is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (i)
knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless
whether it be true or false". But "fraud" in public law  18 is not the same as
"fraud" in private law. Nor can the ingredients, which establish "fraud" in
commercial transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in
Administrative Law. It has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v.
Secretary of State for Home Deptt. (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous
to introduce maxims of common law as to effect of fraud while determining
fraud in relation of statutory law. "Fraud" in relation to statute must be a
colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a statute. "If a statute has
been passed for some one particular purpose, a court of law will not
countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the operation of the Act
to something else which is quite foreign to its object and beyond its scope.
Present day concept of fraud on statute has veered round abuse of power or
mala fide exercise of power. It may arise due to overstepping the limits of
power or defeating the provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the
power may be exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations. The colour
of fraud in public law or administration law, as it is developing, is assuming
different shades. It arises from a deception committed by disclosure of
incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke exercise of power and
procure an order from an authority or tribunal. It must result in exercise of
jurisdiction which otherwise would not have been exercised. The
misrepresentation must be in relation to the conditions provided in a section
on existence or non-existence of which the power can be exercised. But non-
disclosure of a fact not required by a statute to be disclosed may not amount
to fraud. Even in commercial transactions non-disclosure of every fact does
not vitiate the agreement. "In a contract every person must look for himself
and ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad bargain.
In public law the duty is not to deceive. (See Shrisht Dhawan (Smt.) v. M/s.
Shaw Brothers (1992 (1) SCC 534).
37\. In that case it was observed as follows:
19 "Fraud and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in any
civilized system of jurisprudence. It is a concept descriptive of human
conduct. Michael levi likens a fraudster to Milton's sorcerer, Comus, who
exulted in his ability to, 'wing me into the easy-hearted man and trap him
into snares'". It has been defined as an act of trickery or deceit. In
Webster's Third New International Dictionary fraud in equity has been defined
as an act or omission to act or concealment by which one person obtains an
advantage against conscience over another or which equity or public policy
forbids as being prejudicial to another. In Black's Legal Dictionary, fraud is
defined as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing
another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him
or surrender a legal right; a false representation of a matter of fact whether
by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment
of that which should have been disclosed, which deceives and is intended to
deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. In Concise
Oxford Dictionary, it has been defined as criminal deception, use of false
representation to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick.
According to Halsbury's Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have
been false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material date
false in substance and in fact. Section 17 of the Contract Act defines fraud
as act committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive another. From
dictionary meaning or even otherwise fraud arises out of deliberate active
role of representator about a fact which he knows to be untrue yet he succeeds
in misleading the representee by making him believe it to be true. The
representation to become fraudulent must be of the fact with knowledge that it
was false. In a leading English case Derry v. Peek [(1886-90) ALL ER Rep 1:
(1889) 14 AC 337 (HL)] what constitutes fraud was described thus : (All Er p.
22 B-C) `Fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been
made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its truth, or (iii) recklessly,
careless whether it be true or false'."
38\. This aspect of the matter has been considered by this Court in Roshan
Deen v. Preeti Lal (2002 (1) SCC 100) Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High
School and Intermediate Education (2003 (8) SCC 311), Ram Chandra Singh's case
(supra) and Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N. and Another (2004 (3) SCC 1).
39\. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the
court. (see Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust (1996 (3) SCC 310)
and S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu's case (supra).
20
40\. "Fraud" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other
person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to
the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is
not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav's
case (supra).
41\. In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning observed
at pages 712 & 713, "No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be
allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything."
In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ observed that fraud vitiates all
transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity.
42\. There is another statute which has great relevance to the present
dispute, i.e. The Orissa Communal Forest and Private Lands (Prohibitions of
Alienation) Act, 1948 (in short `Communal Forest Land').
43\. In Maganti Subrahmanyam (dead) by his Legal Representative v. The State
of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1970 SC 403) it was observed as follows:
> "4. The purpose of the Act was to prohibit the alienation of communal,
> forest and private lands in estates in the Province of Madras and the
> preamble to the Act shows that it was enacted to prevent indiscriminate
> alienation of communal, forest and private lands in estates in the Province
> of Madras pending the enactment of legislation for acquiring the interests
> of landholders in such estates and introducing ryotwari settlement therein.
> No fixed duration of the Act was specified and it is impossible to hold that
> merely because of the above preamble the Act became a temporary Act. The
> definition of `forest land' is given in Section 2(b) of the Act reading:
> `forest land' includes any waste land containing trees and shrubs, pasture
> land and any other class of land declared by the State Government to be
> forest land by notification in the Fort St. George Gazette".
21
Sub-section (1) of Section 3 prohibited landholders from selling, mortgaging,
converting into ryoti land, leasing or otherwise assigning or alienating any
communal or forest land in an estate without the previous sanction of the
District Collector, on or after the date on which the ordinance which preceded
the Act came into force, namely, 27th June, 1947\. Section 4(1) provided that:
"Any transaction of the nature prohibited by Section 3 which took place, in
the case of any communal or forest land, on or after the 31st day of October,
1939 ... shall be void and inoperative and shall not confer or take away, or
be deemed to have conferred or taken away, any right whatever on or from any
party to the transaction:
* * *" 
This sub-section had a proviso with several clauses. Our attention was drawn
to clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of the proviso but in our opinion none of these
provisos was applicable to the facts of the case so as to exclude the
operation of sub-section (1) of Section 4. Under sub-section (3) of Section 4:
"If any dispute arises as to the validity of the claim of any person to any
land under clauses (i) to (v) of the proviso to sub-section (1), it shall be
open to such person or to any other person interested in the transaction or to
the State Government, to apply to the District Judge of the district in which
the land is situated, for a decision as to the validity of such claim." Under
sub-section (4) the District Judge to whom such application is made was to
decide whether the claim to the land was valid or not after giving notice to
all persons concerned and where the application was not made by the State
Government, to the Government itself, and his decision was to be final. Madras
Act 26 of 1948, was passed on April 19, 1949, being an Act to provide for the
repeal of the Permanent Settlement, the acquisition of the rights of
landholders in permanently settled and certain other estates in the Province
of Madras, and the introduction of ryotwari settlement in such estates.
Apparently because of the preamble to the Act it was contended that with the
enactment of the repeal of the Permanent Settlement by the Act of 1948, which
also provided for the acquisition of the rights of landholders in permanently
settled estates, the Act stood repealed. We fail to see how because of the
preamble to the Act it can be said that it stood repealed by the enactment of
the later Act unless there were express words to that effect or unless there
was a necessary implication. It does not stand to reason to hold that the
alienation of large blocks of land which were rendered void under the Act
became good by reason of the passing of the later Act. Our attention was drawn
to Section 63 of the later Act which provided that:
"If any question arises whether any land in an estate is a forest or is
situated in a forest, or as to the limits of a forest, it shall be determined
by the Settlement Officer, subject to an appeal to the Director within such
time as may be prescribed and also to revision by the Board of Revenue." In
terms the section was only prospective and it did not seek to impeach any
transaction which was effected before the Act and was not applicable to
transactions anterior to the Act. In our opinion Section 56(1) of the  22
later Act to which our attention was drawn by the learned counsel does not
fall for consideration in this case and the disputes covered by that section
do not embrace the question before us.
5, Madras General Clauses Act 1 of 1891, deals with the effect of repeals off
statutes. Section 8, sub-section (f) thereof provides that: "Where any Act, to
which this Chapter applies, repeals any other enactment, then the repeal shall
not--
(a)-(e) * * *
(f) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such right, privilege, obligation, liability, fine, penalty, forfeiture or
punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal proceeding or
remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such fine, penalty,
forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been
passed."
This shows that even if there was a repeal any investigation started before
the repeal would have to be continued and legal proceedings under the Act
could be prosecuted as if the repealing Act had not been passed.
6\. There is also no force in the contention that unless there was a
notification under Section 2(b) of the Act declaring a particular land to be
forest land, the applicability of the Act would be excluded. The definition of
`forest land' in that section is an inclusive one and shows that `forest land'
would include not only waste land containing trees, shrubs and pasture lands
but also any other class of lands declared by Government to be forest land.
This does not mean that before a piece of land could be said to be forest land
there would have to be a notification by the Government under the Act."
44\. In view of the aforesaid conclusions we are of the considered view that
the matter needs to be re-considered by the High Court.
45\. The High Court while re-hearing the matter shall also consider the effect
of the aforesaid observations of this Court, and various aspects highlighted
above.
46\. In the background of the massiveness of apparent fraud involved,
effective and participative role of officials of the State cannot be lost
sight of. Without their active and  23 effective participation manipulation of
records, tampering with documents could not have been possible. The State
would do well to persue the matter with seriousness to unravel the truth and
punish the erring officials and take all permissible actions (including
criminal action) against every one involved.
47\. The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent.

2\. The background facts as highlighted by the appellants are as follows:
The dispute relates to an alleged lease of 53.95 acres of land executed by
Hatapatta dated 25.1.1933 by erstwhile intermediaries i.e. Chakradhar
Mohapatra and Ramakrushna Mohapatra in favour of one Kamala Devi. The
respondent Harapriya Bishoi claimed to be the successor in interest of Kamala
Devi. Undisputedly, the alleged Hatapatta is an unregistered document. The
land is presently situated in the capital city of Bhubaneswar in the State of
Orissa. The purported Hatapatta described the land as being for permanent
cultivation but as per records or rights published in 1930-31 the land is
classified as "uncultivable" within Anabadi Land. The land is further
described as Jhudi jungle i.e. bushy forest. The estate of intermediaries
Chakradhar Mohapatra and Ramakrushna Mohapatra is vested in the State by
virtue of a Notification dated 1.5.1954 issued under Section 3 of the Orissa
Estate Abolition Act, 1951 (in short the `Act'). In respect of the land in
question the Orissa Estate Abolition Case 4 of 1970 was registered. Originally
the case was registered as OEA 18 of 1967 with OEA Collector, Cuttack. On
transfer of certain villages from Cuttack district to Puri District, the case
was transferred to OEA Collector, Bhubneshwar and was re-numbered as OEA Case
No.4 of 1970.
By order dated 6.1.1971 in the said OEA case the OEA Collector set aside the
would include not only waste land containing trees, shrubs and pasture lands
but also any other class of lands declared by Government to be forest land.

By order dated 6.1.1971 in the said OEA case the OEA Collector set aside the
disputed lease deed on the ground of not being genuine. The Collector found
that since the lands were lying fallow, the rent receipts were not genuine.
The Ekpadia or Zamabandi Register in the Tahsil Officer had no mention of
Kamala Devi as a lessee. The lease was unregistered even though vast tracts of
land were transferred. It was thus held that the lease deed was back dated and
was created with the object of defeating the purpose of the Act. The said
order dated 6.1.1971 was upheld by Additional District Magistrate, Puri by
order dated 28.5.1974.
Between the period 1962 to 1973 settlement proceedings were carried out under
