8\. PW­1 is the complainant in the present matter however, he resiled from his

State Vs Satish Gupta PS EOW Page No. 10 of 13 order dated 03.10.2019.
Statement of accused u/s 313 Cr. PC recorded on 04.10.2019 wherein he pleaded
innocence and opted not to lead any defence evidence.
9\. I have heard the rival submissions and carefully perused the record.
REASONS FOR DECISION
10\. In order to prove its case, the prosecution has examined only four
witnesses in total and PE was ordered to be closed as the complainant has
resiled from his original statement recorded in the present matter. Hence, the
complaint remains unproved. Thus, there is nothing incriminating on record qua
accused Satish Gupta.
11\. The entire case was rooted on the testimony of the complainant who is
resiled from his original statement. Hence, no purpose would have FIR No .
200/2011 State Vs Satish Gupta PS EOW Page No. 11 of 13 been served in
examining the remaining witnesses. There is no other incriminating evidence
against the accused on record. The onus to substantiate the case is upon the
prosecution. In the present case, prosecution has failed to prove its case
against the accused Satish Gupta beyond reasonable doubt.
12\. It has been held in case of Sadhu Singh V/s State of Punjab 1997(3) Crime
55 the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court :­ "In a criminal trial, it is for
the prosecution to establish its case beyond all reasonable doubts. It is for
the prosecution to travel the entire distance from may have to must have. If
the prosecution appears to be improbable or lacks credibility the benefit of
doubt necessarily has to go to the accused."
13\. Since the factual matrix of the case has not been proved. I feel no
hesitation in stating that prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the accused persons namely Satish Gupta. Hence, the accused Satish Gupta is
FIR No . 200/2011 State Vs Satish Gupta PS EOW Page No. 12 of 13 acquitted for
the charge framed for the offence U/s 63/65 of Copyright Act and 103/104 of
Trademark Act.
14\. Ordered accordingly.
