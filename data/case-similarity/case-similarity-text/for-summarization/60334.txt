ORDER P.G. Chacko, Member (J)
1\. The respondents are a non-banking financing company. They entered a Joint
Venture with a Dutch company to constitute M/s. Fiat Sundaram Auto Finance
Ltd. (FISAF, for short), wherein the Dutch company held 51% shares and the
respondent-company the remainder. Under the JV agreement, the respondent-
company had an obligation to render the following services to FISAF:
Credit processing or under writing : M/s. Sundaram Finance Ltd., would carry
out the credit approval procedure in accordance with the credit policy laid
down by the company in receiving, evaluating and processing applications of
the customers;
Loan documentation : This service includes obtaining and checking of loan
documents from customers and dealers and record keeping of the same.
Back office i.e. Portfolio Administration and Revenue Accounting Service : It
covers provision of a computer based portfolio administration systems,
transmission of information, creation of contracts and installment schedules,
of any organization.
We have already enumerated the services rendered by the respondents. None of
these has been shown to be a service rendered directly or indirectly in
connection with the management of FISAF. Again, none of these services has
been shown to involve advice, consultancy, or technical assistance relating to
conceptualization, devising, development, modification, rectification or
upgradation of any working system of the JV company. There is substance in the
submission of ld.consultant that some of the services in question are covered
by the definition of "Business Auxiliary Services", which came to be
introduced for levy of service tax w.e.f. 1.7.2003. The services in question
were rendered in Oct'99. The definition of "Management Consultancy" has
continued to be same even after introduction of "Business Auxiliary Services"
for levy of service tax. It would, therefore, mean that a service
appropriately classifiable as "Business. Auxiliary Service" cannot fall within
the ambit of "Management Consultancy". On this point, the respondents can
legitimately claim support from the Tribunal's decision in Glaxo Smithkline
transmission of information, creation of contracts and installment schedules,
accrual processing of all contract financial elements, maintenance of detailed
customer statement of accounts, arrears processing, handling of contract
termination, foreclosures, re-scheduling and administration of personnel and
sales tax functions.
Information Technology and MIS Service : This category of service takes into
account the maintenance of computerized information of the company's revenue
accounting, guaranteeing date integrity, provision of a set of base
customerised MIS reports and special reports.
After Sales Service : This service provides for customer interaction for
regular payments, early settlement, change of financial plan, change in
customer date, insurance and other related miscellaneous services.
Collection Service : This service includes provision of a collection system on
the basis of guidelines laid down by the company in respect of collection,
follow-up, reprocessing and legal proceedings.
Under the agreement, the cost of providing the above services was to be
reimbursed to the respondents by FISAF. When the department proposed to bring
the above services within the purview of definition of "Management
Consultancy" for the purpose of levy of service tax, the respondents got
themselves registered and paid service tax of Rs. 1,24,786/- under protest on
the amount received as consideration for the above services. Later on, the
respondents filed a refund claim by denying having rendered "Management
Consultancy Service" to FISAF. The original authority rejected the refund
claim, but the Commissioner (Appeals) allowed it. Hence the present appeal of
the department.
2\. Heard both sides. Ld.SDR referred to the definition of "Management
Consultancy" as given under Section 65(21) of the Finance Act, 1994 and
submitted that the aforesaid services had been rendered by the respondents,
directly or indirectly, in connection with the management of FISAF and hence
squarely fell within the ambit of the said definition. She also pointed out
that, in answer to a request made by the JV company (FISAF) for advance ruling
on the question whether service tax was leviable on the aforesaid services
rendered to them by the respondents, the Ministry (DGST) had informed FISAF
that the said services would fall within the scope of "Management Consultancy"
defined under Section 65(21) ibid.
3\. Ld.consultant argued in support of the appellate Commissioner's order,
wherein it had been held to the effect that the respondent-company holding 49%
share in FISAF was part and parcel of the day-to-day management of the latter
and, therefore, the services rendered by the respondent-company to FISAF were
in the nature of "internal organization and internal management", which did
not attract the definition of "Management consultancy". Ld.consultant,
further, claimed support from the Tribunal's decision in Glaxo Smithkline
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. CCE Mumbai 2004-TIOL-786-CESTAT-Mum, wherein it was
held that the reimbursements received towards "staff costs and other expenses
& share services" by the appellant-company from their JV partner were held to
be not taxable under "Management Consultancy" defined under Section 65 of the
Finance Act, 1994.
4\. After giving careful consideration to the submissions, we find substance
in the view taken by the lower appellate authority that the work done by the
respondents was in the nature of 'in-house services" rendered by them as
partner of the JV company. Section 65(21) of the Finance Act, 1994 defines
"Management Consultancy" as follows:
Management consultant means any person who is engaged in providing any
service, either directly or indirectly, in connection with the management of
any organization in any manner and includes any person who renders any advice,
consultancy or technical assistance, relating to conceptualizing, devising,
development, modification, rectification or upgradation of any working system
of any organization.

been shown to involve advice, consultancy, or technical assistance relating to
conceptualization, devising, development, modification, rectification or

submission of ld.consultant that some of the services in question are covered
by the definition of "Business Auxiliary Services", which came to be
introduced for levy of service tax w.e.f. 1.7.2003. The services in question
were rendered in Oct'99. The definition of "Management Consultancy" has
continued to be same even after introduction of "Business Auxiliary Services"
for levy of service tax. It would, therefore, mean that a service
appropriately classifiable as "Business. Auxiliary Service" cannot fall within
the ambit of "Management Consultancy". On this point, the respondents can
legitimately claim support from the Tribunal's decision in Glaxo Smithkline
Pharmaceuticals (supra).
5\. The appellant has not succeeded in rebutting any of the points made in the
impugned order. In the result, the appeal gets dismissed.
(Operative part of the order was pronounced in open court on 2.1.2007)
of any organization.
