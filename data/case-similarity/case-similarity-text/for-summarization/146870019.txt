BENCH:
The captioned appeal has been filed at the instance of the Assessee against
goods from the parties whose VAT/ CST registrations were cancelled. In the
absence of the assistance from the side of the assessee, we can draw an
adverse inference by holding that such amount of VAT credit relates to such
parties i.e. the registrations were cancelled. If that be so, then it is clear
that the claim was made by the assessee on account of such VAT credit for the
purchases from the parties not having valid registration number. Therefore, it
is inferred that such claim of the assessee was not bona fide in the absence
of contrary documentary evidence. Thus we not find any reason to interfere in
the order of the Ld. CIT(A). Hence, the ground of appeal of the assessee is
dismissed.

21\. In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.

The captioned appeal has been filed at the instance of the Assessee against
the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-6, Ahmedabad [CIT(A) in
short] vide appeal no.CIT(A)-6/45/16-17 dated 15/12/2017 arising in the
assessment order passed under s.143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961(hereinafter
referred to as "the Act") dated 29/03/2016 relevant to Assessment Year (AY)
2013-14.
The assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:-
> ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -2-
> 1\. The learned CIT(A) has erred both in law and on the facts of the case in
> confirming the disallowance of Rs.11,35,011/- u/s.69C of the Act by treating

> 2\. Alternatively and without prejudice, the learned CIT(A) erred in not

> 3\. The learned CIT(A) has erred both in law and on the facts of the case in

The appellant craves leave to add, amend, alter, edit, delete, modify or
change all or any of the grounds of appeal at the time of or before the
hearing of the appeal.
2\. Briefly stated facts are that the assessee an individual and engaged in
the business of trading of shipping machineries, ship engine, & engine parts
and mill sale.
3\. The assessee in the year under consideration has shown purchases from
various parties including the parties as detailed below:
> ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -3-
> 1) Impex sale corporation Rs. 8,52,507/-
2) Sankalp Traders Rs. 2,82,504/-
4\. However, the AO during the assessment proceedings found that the VAT/ CST
registration of the aforesaid parties were cancelled by the VAT department
effective from the financial year 2011-12. Therefore the AO held that the
assessee has shown bogus purchases from the parties as mentioned above.
Accordingly the impugned purchases as claimed by the assessee were treated as
unexplained expenses under section 69C of the Act and added to the total
income of the assessee.
Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld. CIT(A).
5\. The assessee before the Ld. CIT(A) claimed that he has shown sales against
such purchases in the books of accounts which have not been disturbed by the
AO. In case the purchases are treated as bogus then the assessee should be
entitled for the deduction of the sales made against such purchases.
6\. The AO did not carry out any independent verification from the aforesaid
parties to verify the veracity of the purchases claimed by the assessee
despite having the power under the statute under section 133(6)/131 of the
Act.
6.1 The AO erred in treating the impugned purchases as bogus merely on the
basis of the information obtained from the website of the sales tax ITA
No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -4-
department about the cancellation of registration certificate of the parties
as discussed above. As such, the impugned purchases and the corresponding
sales were duly recorded in the books of accounts and there is no whisper
about any defect therein.
6.2 Without prejudice to the above, the assessee submitted that even otherwise
the entire amount of purchases cannot be added to the total income of the
assessee treating the same as unexplained expenses under section 69C of the
Act. At the most, some reasonable estimate of profit can be made to prevent
the Revenue leakage if any.
7\. However, the Ld.CIT (A) disagreed with the contention of the assessee by
observing that the onus lies on the assessee to prove his stand that the
impugned purchases were from the genuine parties. Therefore, the obligation
lies on the assessee to produce the parties from whom the purchases were made
in the year under consideration.
In view of the above, the Ld. CIT(A) treated the entire amount as bogus
purchases after having reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of N.K.Proteins Ltd. Vs. DCIT, 2017 -TIOL- 23-SC-IT and confirmed the
order of the AO.
Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld. CIT(A), the assessee is in appeal
before us.
ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -5-
8\. The Ld. AR before us submitted that the AO and the ld. CIT-A failed to
appreciate that purchases made by assessee from the parties are absolutely
genuine as evident from the followings.
a. Books of accounts are duly audited which is at pages 6 to 21 of the paper
book.
b. Ledgers of the concerned parties containing details of underlying purchases
which is at page 25 to 26 of paper book.
8.1 The documentary evidences amply prove the purchases made from the parties
in question are absolutely genuine. Hence, question of making any disallowance
in respect of the same does not arise at all.
8.2 Learned A.R further submitted that the corresponding ''sales'' have not
been disputed. Thus, the factum of sales made by the assessee has not been
doubted by AO at all. If the assessee had not made the underlying purchases,
it would have been possible for assessee to make the corresponding sales. This
shows that goods have undoubtedly been purchased by the assessee. Hence, no
case of bogus purchases can be made out.
8.3 In case AO had any doubt as to the purchases, AO could have called for
details from the said parties by issuing notices u/s.133(6) of the Act.
However, AO chose not to do anything of such sort. Under such circumstances,
assessee cannot be penalized by disallowaing the entire purchases made by the
assessee from the referred parties.
ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -6- 8.4
Alternatively, it is a normal practice whereby purchases are actually made
from unregistered dealers or other suppliers who do not issue any bills and
hence, to regularize such bills, accommodation bills are obtained. Such goods
but that, by itself, doesn't render concerned purchases as bogus.
8.5 In such scenario, addition should be confirmed based on some reasonable
estimate. Reliance is placed on "CIT vs Gujarat Ambuja Export Ltd. Tax Appeal
840 of 2013" (Annexure ''A'') wherein a view has been taken that addition @ 5%
of alleged bogus purchases would meet ends of justice.
9\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR before us vehemently supported the order of
the authorities below.
10\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. The AO in the instant case has treated the
purchases from the 2 parties namely Impex Sales Corporation and Sankalp
Traders amounting to Rs. 11,35,011/-respectively as unexplained expenses under
section 69C of the Act. The primary reason for treating such purchases as
unexplained expenses that the registration certificate under VAT/CST were
cancelled by the sales tax department effectively from the financial year
2011-12. The informations about the cancellation of these certificates were
obtained by the AO from the website of the sale tax department.
ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -7- 10.1
Subsequently, the Ld. CIT(A) confirmed the order of the AO by observing that
the onus lies on the assessee to justify the expenses incurred by him by
producing the parties besides the documentary evidence.
10.2 The addition in the present case was made under section 69C of the Act on
account of unexplained expenses. Indeed, the primary onus lies on the assessee
to justify the expenses claimed by him. However from the preceding discussion,
we note that the assessee has discharged his onus by furnishing the copy of
the ledger of the parties where the addresses of such parties were mentioned.
In case, there is any doubt on the genuineness of the transactions from the
so-called parties, the AO should have exercised his power granted under these
statute under section 133(6)/131 of the Act by issuing notices for the purpose
of the confirmation. But the AO has not done so.
10.3 Similarly, we are not convinced with the finding of the Ld. CIT(A) that
the assessee was under the obligation to produce the impugned parties. It is
because, the assessee cannot under any law enforce the attendance of such
parties whereas the Revenue was empowered under the statute to call upon such
parties.
10.4 We also note that the assessee has claimed to have made sales against
such purchases which have been admitted by the Revenue. As such in our
considered view, such sales cannot be executed without having the
corresponding purchases. There was no defect pointed out by ITA
No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -8- the
authorities below insofar the sales made against such purchases. Moreover,
there is also no allegation regarding the genuineness of the books of accounts
which were duly audited under the Income Tax Act. However, before parting we
cannot ignore the practice prevailing in the business industries to purchase
the goods from the grey market and subsequently justify such purchases by
obtaining a purchase bill from the parties engaged in providing accommodation
entries. It is because the assessee in the present case has claimed to have
purchased the goods from the parties not having valid VAT/CST registration
certificate though he is claiming to have purchased goods from the registered
party. Moreover, there was no submission from the side of the assessee against
the finding of the authorities below about the cancellation of the
registration certificates of the impugned parties. In view of the above, we
can presume that the actual purchases were made by the assessee from the grey
market but shown in the name of impugned parties. Our presumption is also
fortified as the assessee has not produced any evidence for the payment
against such purchases.
10.5 We are also conscious to the fact that the assessee has already declared
the GP in its books of accounts by recording the sales and the corresponding
purchases. But to prevent the possible leakage of the Revenue, as the
purchases from the local/grey market is normally cheaper, we are inclined to
make the ad hoc addition at the rate of 10% of such purchases in order to meet
the end of justice and to stop the ongoing dispute. In holding so, we find
support and guidance from the judgment ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah
vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14  -9- of ITAT Ahmedabad in case of ITO vs. Sun
steel reported in 92 TTJ 1126 wherein it was held as under:
> "At the most it, can be presumed that the assessee did not make purchases
> from above parties but made from other unregistered dealer and got benefit
> of margin of purchases from unregistered dealer. We find that to that extent
> an estimation of profit can be made which will be fair and reasonable under
> the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, for the above purposes
> we estimate Rs. 50,000 and accordingly the- order of the CIT(A) is modified
> and the addition to the extent of Rs. 50,000 is sustained and balance
> addition of Rs. 26,89,407 is deleted out of the total addition made of Rs.
> 27,39,407."
In view of the above, we direct the AO to make the ad-hoc addition on such
purchases as discussed above. Hence the ground of appeal of the assessee is
partly allowed.
11\. The 2nd issue raised by the assessee is that the Ld. CIT(A) erred in
confirming the addition made by the AO for Rs. 5,20,205/- on account of bad
debts.
11.1 The assessee in the year under consideration has claimed bad debt
amounting to Rs. 5,20,205/- but failed to furnish the details of the parties
viz a viz details of the sales made to them. Therefore the AO disallowed the
same and added to the total income of the assessee.
Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld. CIT(A).
11.2 The assessee before the Ld. CIT(A) submitted that it has claimed the
deduction with respect to the following parties:
> ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14
> \- 10 -
> i M/s Sino star minerals Ltd Rs. 2,56,355/-
> ii. M/s Ishita Overseas Rs. 2,63,850/-
> 11.3 In case of M/s Sino star minerals Ltd.
The assessee claimed to have furnished performance guarantee bond to the party
amounting to USD 5500.00 only but he failed to perform the same. Therefore the
party has forfeited the same equivalent to INR 2,56,355.00. The assessee
accordingly claimed that such loss was incurred in the course of the business
therefore the same should be allowed. The assessee in support of his
contention also filed the Remittance sheet of USD and contract with Sino star
minerals Ltd.
11.4 M/s Ishita Overseas The assessee claimed that he has made the sale to the
party which was duly accounted for in the books of accounts. But the party did
not pay the outstanding amount. Therefore the same was claimed as bad debts.
The assessee also claimed that the entry in the books of accounts of the bad
debts is sufficient enough to claim the deduction for the same.
12\. However, the Ld. CIT (A) disregarded the contention of the assessee by
observing that the amount due from the above mentioned parties was not shown
as income in earlier years. Therefore, the same cannot be allowed as bad
debts. In view of the above, the Ld. CIT(A) confirmed the order of the AO.
ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14
\- 11 -
Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld. CIT(A) the assessee is in appeal
before us.
13\. The Ld. AR before us submitted as follows:
> a. With respect to the amount of Rs.2,56.355/-, it is the amount remitted to
> Sino Star International for Performance Guarantee Bond in respect of Iron
> Ore Contract:
> Ledger of Sino Star International is on pg.28 of P/B. Remittance Sheet is on
> pgs.29-30 of P/B. Relevant contract for supply of Iron is on pgs.31-39 of
> P/B.
> b. Assessee had remitted USD 5500 lo Sino Star International for performance
> guarantee bond. However, on account of failure of the assessee to honor its
> commitment, such bond came to be executed and the assessee had to pay the
> sum in question to Sino Star International. CIT(A) has not found any fault
> with the said factual contention raised by the assessee (Pg. 10 of CIT(A)"s
> order).
> c. Under such circumstances, the impugned disallowance ought to have been
> deleted.
> d. Alternatively, such sum has been paid in the normal course of business of
> the assessee., Hence, the same must be allowed as "business loss" u/s 28 or
> 37of the Act e. For the amount pertaining to Ishita Overseas (Rs.2,63,850/),
> assessee had sold goods to the said party in the past and the amount

> name of the said party was on account of sales made to the said party in the

> g. However, since the assessee could not recover such outstanding dues from

> h. Since such sum has been written off in books as irrecoverable, such bad

> i. Alternatively, such sum may be allowed as "Business loss" u/s 28 or 37 of

14\. On the other hand the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of the
authorities below.
15\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. It is the settled law that the losses incurred
by the assessee in the course of the business activities are allowable
deduction either under section 37(1) or 28 of the Act. In this ITA
No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14
\- 13 -
regard we draw support and guidance from the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in case of CIT Vs. Nanital bank Ltd. reported in 55 ITR 707 wherein it was
held as under:
> "Under section 10(1) of the Act the trading loss of a business is deductible
> for computing the profit earned by the business. But every loss is not so
> deductible unless it is incurred in carrying out the operation of the
> business and is incidental to the operation. Whether loss is incidental to
> the operation of a business is a question of fact to be decided on the facts
> of each case, having regard to the nature of the operations carried on and
> the nature of the risk involved in carrying them out. The degree of the risk
> or its frequency is not of much relevance but its nexus to the nature of the
> business is material."
15.1 On perusal of the contract copy between the assessee and the party namely
Sino Star Minerals Ltd. which is placed on pages 32 to 38 of the paper book,
we note that such agreement/contract was made for the commercial purposes. The
relevant extract reads as under:
> "SELLER PADMAVATI GLOBAL SERVICES Gujarat India BUYER SINO STAR MINERALS

15.2 We further note that the impugned payment was made by the assessee in
connection with such contract as evident from the copy of the ledger of M/s
Sino Star Minerals Ltd. (Guarantee Bond) placed on page 28 of the PB for the
previous year 2010-11 in which such payment was made. In view of the above, we
hold that the assessee is eligible for the deduction of the impugned loss as
incurred in the course of the business but not as bad debts under the
provisions of section 36(1)(vii) of the Act.
15.3 Regarding the claim of the bad debts for the amount of Rs. 2,63,850/- due
from Ishita Overseas, we note that the assessee has furnished the copy of the
ledger of the party which was also consisting the address of such party. But
the AO without taking any confirmation from such party whether such amount
represents the sales made to it has ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah
vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14
\- 15 -
disallowed the bad debts. Indeed the onus lies on the assessee to furnish the
details of the sales made to the parties. But the assessee failed to furnish
the same despite the enough opportunities provided by the authorities below.
15.4 However, in the case on hand, we cannot ignore the ledger copies filed by
the assessee which is placed on pages 27 of the paper book while deciding the
issue on hand. Accordingly, we infer that the impugned amount of the bad debts
represents against the sales made by the assessee.
In view of the above, we are not convinced with the finding of the authorities
below. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Ld. CIT(A) and direct the AO
to delete the addition made by him.
16\. The next issue raised by the assessee is that the Ld. CIT(A) erred in
confirming the addition made by the AO for Rs. 4,899/- on account of the Act
VAT credit written off.
16.1 The assessee in the year under consideration has claimed the deduction
for the VAT credit written of Rs. 4,899/- only but failed to furnish the
supporting evidences. Therefore the same was disallowed and added to the total
income of the assessee.
17\. Aggrieved assessee preferred an appeal to the Ld. CIT(A) who has also
confirmed the order of the AO by observing as under:
> ITA No.268/Ahd/2018 Tushar Parimal Shah vs. ITO Asst.Year - 2013-14
> \- 16 -
> "7.3. After considering findings of the AO and submissions of the appellate,
> this ground is adjudicated as under.
> It is seen that the appellant had debited Rs.4,899/- to P&L A/c on account
> of VAT Credit written off. However, both at the assessment and appellate
> proceedings stage no details were given in terms of names of party and
> transaction in respect of which the appellant was required to collect the
> VAT Credit, and which could not be recovered. In the absence of these
> details, disallowance of VAT Credit Written off of Rs.4,899/- is upheld.
> This ground of appeal is rejected."
Being aggrieved by the order of the Ld. CIT(A), the assessee is in appeal
before us.
18\. The Ld. AR before us submitted as under:
> " It is submitted that certain VAT credit was written off by the assessee in
> the books of accounts by debited the same to P&L a/c.
> Such expenditure has also arisen in the normal course of business of the
> assessee. Hence, such sum is allowable "Business loss" u/s.28 or 37 of the
> Act. Reliance is placed on the judgments referred to hereinabove in support
> of similar argument raised while dealing with ground w.r.t.Bad debts."
19\. On the other hand, the Ld. DR vehemently supported the order of the
authorities below.
20\. We have heard the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the
materials available on record. In the present case the assessee has claimed
the deduction for the amount of VAT credit written off in the ITA

books of accounts. However the assessee failed to furnish the details of the
parties/purchases during the assessment proceedings in relation to which the
amount of VAT credit was claimed. Thus in the absence of the documentary
evidence the AO made the addition which was subsequently confirmed by the Ld.
CIT(A).
20.1 Indeed, the primary onus lies on the assessee for claiming the deduction
of the expenses/loss written off in the course of the business. But the
assessee failed to furnish the necessary details. Therefore, in the absence of
any information by the assessee, it is difficult to entertain the claim of the
assessee.
20.2 However, the facts of the case on hand are bit peculiar insofar there was
an allegation from the authorities below that the assessee has purchased the
goods from the parties whose VAT/ CST registrations were cancelled. In the
absence of the assistance from the side of the assessee, we can draw an
adverse inference by holding that such amount of VAT credit relates to such
parties i.e. the registrations were cancelled. If that be so, then it is clear
that the claim was made by the assessee on account of such VAT credit for the
purchases from the parties not having valid registration number. Therefore, it
is inferred that such claim of the assessee was not bona fide in the absence
of contrary documentary evidence. Thus we not find any reason to interfere in
the order of the Ld. CIT(A). Hence, the ground of appeal of the assessee is
dismissed.
