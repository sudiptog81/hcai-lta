Trademarks Act.
3 O.S.No.4514/2015
2\. The brief facts of the plaintiff's case as pleaded in the plaint is as
follows:
The Plaintiff is a registered partnership concern carrying on business of
Andhra Style Vegetarian & Non- vegetarian Restaurant. The Plaintiff is using
the Trade mark NANDHINI in respect of said business since 1989. The artistic
work, design and get-up in respect of trade mark NANDHINI exclusively belongs
to them. On account of intrinsic value, salesmanship and quality of food
prepared by them, their trade mark has become popular all over South India.
The Trademark and Copyright in respect of NANDHINI exclusively belongs to the
Plaintiff. They are running 12 branches at Bangalore. They also registered
their trade mark NANDHINI and NANDHINI DELUXE under class 42, under various
numbers 1294121, 1284398, 1284399, and 1360905. The same has been registered
under the Copy right Act 1957 under No.A-62848/2002. Plaintiff further submits
that the Defendant has commenced his business under the name NANDINI VEG. The
action of the Defendant to adopt the trademark NANDINI VEG is fraudulent,
illegal, contrary to law and unauthorized and calculated to deceive the
customers and perverse, illegal  4 O.S.No.4514/2015 and amounts to an act of
deceit. The trade mark NANDHINI VEG is structurally, phonetically and visually
similar to Plaintiff's registered Trademark. Defendant has no authority or
right to use the trading style NANDINI VEG for running restaurant. Since the
Plaintiff and Defendant are engaged in business of providing food, the
adoption of trade name NANDINI VEG by Defendant is causing confusion among the
customers and it also amounts to infringement and passing off under Trademarks
Act. The Plaintiff has issued a legal notice dtd.31.3.2015 calling upon the
Defendant to cease and desist from using Trademark NANDINI VEG. The Defendant
has sent a reply dtd.18.4.2015 denying the allegations and refused to comply
with the demand enumerated in the notice. Hence the suit is filed for the
above reliefs.
3\. In pursuance to the suit summons, the Defendant appeared through its
counsel and filed written statement denying the plaint averments and further
contended that the suit is not maintainable either under law or on facts. It
lacks bonafides bereft of merit and liable to be dismissed in limine. The
Plaintiff has approached this court with unclean hands. The Plaintiff is not
entitled for any suitable reliefs. The  5 O.S.No.4514/2015 person who has
signed and verified the suit has no authority to do so. Defendant also
contended that the name and style of establishment of the Defendant is nothing
to do with the establishment of the Plaintiff. The artistic work , design and
getup with specially design font, with dots inserted in each of the alphabet
by name NANDHINI DELUXE are not similar in any manner with that of the
Defendant's concern name. That the Defendant do not aware that the Plaintiff
is running 12 branches in and around Bangalore. The Defendant has also
contended that M/s. Karnataka Milk Federation Corporation (KMFC) has initiated
the proceedings against the Plaintiff before the competent authority and
before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. The Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka has nullified the Trademark claimed by the Plaintiff in
WP.No.37192/2013 to 37195/2013. Hence, the Plaintiff do not have any right
whatsoever to claim the Trademark or Copyright in its favour. The Defendant
has also contended that the Defendant's trade name do not have any similarity
with that of the Plaintiff's name. The Defendant has obtained necessary
license from competent Government Authority and doing its business since last
3 years without any complaints from any one else. The mere naming the business
concern with NANDINI VEG will not violates  6 O.S.No.4514/2015 the Trademarks
Act. The Plaintiff is simply harassing the Defendant for unlawful gain. The
sales turnover of the Plaintiff is imaginary and concocted. The name of the
Defendant concern is very common in general public. The Defendant is running
purely a Udupi Style Vegetarian hotel and is nothing to do with the business
of the Plaintiff like Andhra style food. This Defendant is not at all using
the label, phamphets, brochure, or advertising the business to canvas the
business of the Plaintiff. There is no cause of action to file the suit. The
Plaintiff has also suppressed the proceedings initiated by the KMFC. The court
fee paid is improper. On the above said grounds the Defendant prays to dismiss
the suit.
4\. On the basis of the above pleadings my predecessor in office has framed
the following issues
1\. Whether the Plaintiff proves that it is the registered owner of Trademark
NANDINI DELUXE / NANDHINI?
2\. Whether the Plaintiff proves that the Defendant had infringed the
Plaintiff's well established Trademark NANDINI VEG?
3\. Whether the Plaintiff proves that the Defendant has passed off their
Trademarks NANDHINI DELUXE?
4\. Whether the Plaintiff is entitled for the decree of permanent and
mandatory injunctions as sought for?
7 O.S.No.4514/2015
5\. Whether the Plaintiff is entitled for the damages as sought for?
6\. What Order or Decree?
5\. The Plaintiff in order to substantiate their contention got examined its
managing partner as PW1, got marked the documents at Ex.P1 to 15. On the other
hand the proprietor of the Defendant is examined as DW1 and not produced any
documents.
6\. I have heard the learned counsel for the Plaintiff and Defendant. The
learned counsel for the Plaintiff has cited plethora of cases:

In fact the law pronounced on these judgments have become axiomatic and the
same has been applied by me in the appreciation of the relevant material on
record.
7\. I answer the above issues are as follows: Issue No.1: In the affirmative
9 O.S.No.4514/2015 Issue No.2: In the affirmative Issue No.3: In the
affirmative Issue No.4: In the affirmative Issue No.5: In the negative Issue
No.6: As per final order, for the following:
REA S ON S
8\. Before adverting to the appreciation of evidence on each issues let me
analyse the legal position with regard to the suit on infringement or passing
off of Trademark.
9\. The Parliament by virtue of Article 246(1) and entry No.49, List-1- Union
List in the 7 th schedule of Constitution of India makes the law relating to
the Trademark as it is a exclusive domain of Central Government to pass a
legislation on trademark. Prior to the first enactment of the Trademark Act
1940, the Trademark Suits were governed by Common Law. The Trademarks Act was
repealed by Trade and Merchandise Act 1958\. Thereafter, it was revised by
Trademark Act 1999, Trademark Rules 2002 & 2017 to make it compliance with
TRIPS obligations. A Trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing goods or
service of one enterprise from those of other enterprise. The definition  10
O.S.No.4514/2015 of the Mark defined under the Trademark Act is not
exhaustive. It includes a letter, word, heading, numeral, brand, device,
signature etc. Any person claiming to be the proprietor of the Trademark can
file an application for Trademark in his name, partner of the firm, any
company, any Government Department, a trust or joint applicants. Once the
application is made to Trademark registry, and after resolving the objections
if any, the Trademark is registered and published in Trademark Journal. The
registration is initially valid upto 10 years and renewal for subsequent
period of 10 years and so on. The registration can also be cancelled or
revoked on several grounds.
10\. It is also settled principle of law that a registered owner of the
Trademark can bring a composite suit for both infringement and passing off.
However unregistered user remedy is only a common law remedy for passing off.
In a suit by a registered Trademark owner against an unregistered Trademark
owner, defendant can always defend the suit by showing that he is the prior
user and also can restrain the act of the Plaintiff. A registered or
unregistered Trademark can also be assigned or transmitted with or without the
goodwill of business. For the infringement action the  11 O.S.No.4514/2015
Plaintiff has to establish that the offending mark is identical and
deceptively similar to registered Trademark. A unregistered Trademark owner
can also file a suit against the registered Trademark owner for passing off.
Hence the suit for infringement or passing off depends upon the concept of
prior user. The court can also grant injunction, award damages, order for
account of profits along with delivery of infringed materials, for destruction
or eraser depending on the facts and circumstances of each case.
11\. Though Sec.27(1) prohibits infringement suit by unregistered Trademark
owner, Sec.27(2) provides for passing off action. The Sec.28 of the Act
confers right on a registered owner. There is also mandatory provision
u/s.29(3) that offending mark identity with the registered Trademark goods and
services are likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or which is
likely to have association with the registered Trademark. Sec.34 also protects
the interest of prior user. Sec.57 provides for powers to cancel or vary, the
Trademark by the appellate board. Sec.124 provides for stay of proceedings.
Sec.134 provides for filing of suit before the District Courts. Sec.135
provides for relief which may be granted  12 O.S.No.4514/2015 for passing off.
Keeping the above principles in mind let me analyse each issues.
12\. Issue No.1: The Plaintiff in his pleading has contended that it is a
registered partnership concern carrying on business of Andhra Style vegetarian
& Non- vegetarian restaurant. The Plaintiff's have been using the Trade Mark
NANDHINI in respect of said business since 1989\. The artistic work, design
and get-up in respect of Trade Mark NANDHINI exclusively belongs to them. On
account of intrinsic value, salesmanship and quality of food prepared by them,
their Trade Mark has become popular all over south India. The Trademark and
Copyright in respect of NANDHINI exclusively belongs to the Plaintiff. They
are running 12 branches at Bangalore. They also registered their Trade Mark
NANDHINI and NANDHINI DELUXE under class 42, under various numbers 1294121,
1284398, 1284399, and 1360905. The same has been registered under the Copy
right Act 1957 under No.A-62848/2002.
13\. To substantiate its claim as to registered Trademark the Plaintiff in his
evidence has also reiterated the plaint averments with regard to the
registration of the Trademark and has relied on Ex.P7 to  13 O.S.No.4514/2015
10\. Ex.P7 the legal use certificate issued by Trademark registry with regard
to Trademark No.1284398 in class 42 providing of food and drink, temporary
accommodation for the word mark of NANDHINI. Used since 31.12.1989 in the name
of Plaintiff (N.Anand) which is valid upto 13.5.2024. Ex.P8 the legal use
certificate issued by Trademark registry with regard to Trademark No.1284399
in class 42 providing of food and drink, temporary accommodation for the word
mark of NANDHINI DELUXE DEV. Used since 31.12.1989 in the name of Plaintiff
(N.Anand) which is valid upto 13.5.2024. Ex.P9 the legal use certificate
issued by Trademark registry with regard to Trademark No.1360905 in class 42
providing of food and drink, temporary accommodation for the word mark of
HOTEL NANDHINI(LOGO). Used since 17.4.2002 in the name of Plaintiff (N.Anand)
which is valid upto 1.6.2025. Ex.P10 the legal use certificate issued by
Trademark registry with regard to Trademark No.1294121 in class 42 providing
of food and drink, temporary accommodation for the word mark of NANDHINI
(LABEL). Used since 31.12.1989 in the name of Plaintiff (N.Anand) which is
valid upto 1.7.2024. Ex.P1 dtd.5.11.2002 issued by Deputy Register of
Copyright shows that N.Anand is the owner of the artistic word NANDHINI.
14 O.S.No.4514/2015
14\. In response to first issue the defendant in his written statement has
contended that the Plaintiff has not produced any documents to show its
Trademark publication in a journal. The word NANDHINI is a sacred word it can
be used by any one. No one can claim exclusive claim over the word NANDHINI.
On the date of filing the suit, there was a case pending against the Plaintiff
by KMFC in IPAB No.MP.47/10, MP.53/10. Therefore,he did not have any right to
file a suit against the Defendant. Hence, prayed this court to dismiss the
suit on this ground alone.
15\. The defendant has also contended that the Plaintiff has no authorisation
to file the suit. There is no resolution of partnership firm filed by the
Plaintiff to represent the suit by the Plaintiff. The counsel for the
Defendant has also argued that the Plaintiff has not produced any document to
show that it is a partnership firm. There is a bar contending Sec.69(2) of
Partnership Act. Unregistered firm cannot sue. Hence prayed this court to
dismiss the suit at the threshold. The learned counsel for the defendant has
relied on para 14 of the decision reported in AIR 2009 Himachal Pradesh 10 -
15 O.S.No.4514/2015
Naranjan Chauhan Vs. State of H.P.& Others wherein it is held as follows:
Partnership Act .S.69(2)- Effect of non-
registration - Bar of S.69(2)- Pleadings - Plea that suit was barred by S.69
not specifically pleaded in written statement, but it was specifically
mentioned that suit was not maintainable - Once plea was taken that the suit
was not maintainable, plaintiff was not taken by surprise and he was well
aware of question being raised - it cannot be said that this plea cannot be
considered until and unless it was specifically pleaded- plea being legal one
can be raised at any stage. (PARA 14) Further he had relied on the decision
reported in AIR 2002 Kerala 33 - M/s. Popular Automobiles Vs. GK.Chami wherein
it is held as follows:
> Partnership Act S.69(1) Firm- Suit on behalf of - plaint signed by manager
> of firm as authorised by one of its partners - His name not shown as partner
> in register of firms- Nor power of attorney given by firm to him to verify
> and sign plaint on behalf of firm - Very institution of suit is bad for non-
> compliance of mandatory provisions.
Further he had relied on para 7 of the decision reported in (2018) 9 SCC 183 -
Nandhini Deluxe Vs. Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Ltd.,
wherein plaintiff/ appellant had argued that " the trade  16 O.S.No.4514/2015
mark NANDHINI is not an invented word and, therefore, there was no question of
copying the trademark of the respondent. The word NANDHINI represents the name
of goddess and a cow in Hindu Mythology. The trademark NANDHINI is used by
people from all walks of life and it is also referred in Puranas and Hindu
mythological stories. Large number of people worship NANDHINI as a goddess
and, therefore, the respondent cannot claim monopoly over the word NANDHINI."
Therefore it was submitted by the leaned counsel that the plaintiff is bound
by the argument that has been made before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and cannot
claim exclusive right over the word NANDHINI.
16\. I have perused the entire decision, in the above said matter the
appellant had challenged the order of Hon'ble High Court and IPAB. The Hon'ble
Apex Court restored the order of Deputy Registrar granting registration in
favour of the appellant / plaintiff. Therefore, it shows that the registration
of trade name NANDHINI DELUXE is still valid and the contention by the learned
counsel for defendant that the plaintiff/appellant while arguing before the
Hon'ble Apex Court had contended that no one had exclusive right over the word
NANDHINI, the said argument is not relevant as  17 O.S.No.4514/2015 it is a
mere argument and not a ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
17\. The counsel for the Plaintiff in his argument relied on the ruling in
MANU/SC/0004/1960 - Purushotham Umed Bai case. Wherein the Apex Court in para
12 held as follows:
> It is clear from this provision of the Act that the word " firm " or the "
> firm name " is merely a compendious description of all the partners
> collectively. It follows, therefore, that where a suit is filed in the name
> of a firm it is still a suit by all the partners of the firm unless it is
> proved that all the partners had not authorized the suit. A firm may not be
> a legal entity in the sense of a corporation or a company incorporated under
> the Indian Companies Act it is still an existing concern where business is
> done by a number of persons in partnership. When a suit is filed in the name
> of a firm it is in reality a suit by all the partners of the firm. If 0. XXX
> had not been introduced into the Code and a suit had been filed in the name
> of a firm it would not be a case of a suit filed by a nonexistent person. It
> would still be a suit by the partners of a firm, the defect being that they
> were described as a firm. In order to clarify matters a court would permit
> an amendment by striking out the name of the firm and replacing it with the
> name of the persons forming the partnership. It would be a case of
> misdescription. Even if the provisions of 0. 1, r. 10 and 0. VI, r. 17 did
> 18 O.S.No.4514/2015 not strictly apply the amendment could be permitted
> under s. 153 of the Civil Procedure Code because it was not a case of either
> adding parties or substituting parties. The High Court referred to a number
> of decisions to which no particular reference need be made but they do
> support the view taken by the High Court that in the present case the
> Plaintiff described in the plaint as the firm of Manilal & Sons was a mere
> misdescription capable of amendment and not a case where a plaint had been
> filed by a non-existent person and therefore a nullity.
The Plaintiff has also contended that the Trademark registration certificate
are stands in the name of N.Anand trading as NANDHINI. The very suit is filed
by N.Anand, hence the suit is maintainable and prayed to allow the suit.
18\. I have carefully perused the pleadings of both parties and the rulings
relied and heard the arguments on the point. On the perusal of Ex.P7 to 10 it
clearly shows that the trademark NANDHINI is used since 31.12.1989 the same is
in the name of plaintiff N Anand which is valid upto 13.5.2024. Sec.2(1)(v)
defines the registered proprietor as in relation to a trademark means the
person for the time being entered in the register as proprietor of the
trademark. Sec.2(1)(b) defines the registered trademark as a trademark which
is actually on  19 O.S.No.4514/2015 the register and remaining in force. On
perusal of the Ex.P7 to 10 it clearly shows that the word NANDHINI is the
registered trademark which found on the register and remained in force and
N.Anand is the registered proprietor whose name has been entered as proprietor
in the register of the trademark. This fact has not been rebutted by the
defendant. As per Sec.91 of the Indian Evidence Act states that when the terms
of the contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of property have
been reduced to the form of a document and it all case in which any matter is
required by law to be reduced in the form of a document no evidence shall be
given in proof of term of contract, grant or other disposition of property of
such matter except the document itself or secondary evidence of its contents,
in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions herein
before contended. Even in this case also the law requires that the trademark
has to be registered for its effective action against infringement and passing
off. When the trademark is registered and the trademark certificate itself is
produced, the defendant cannot introduce any oral evidence to disprove the
fact.
19\. I have also perused the Sec.69(2) of the Partnership Act 1932 in which it
states that no suit to  20 O.S.No.4514/2015 enforce a right arising from a
contract shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of a firm against
any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are have
been shown in the register of firms as a partners in the firm. From the above
said provision it makes cleat that in a normal suit which would arise from a
contract it is only the registered firm which can file a suit. It is a settled
principle of law as enunciated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Haldircon
Bhujiawala v Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar - 2000 (3) SCC 250. It is well settled
that a passing-off action is a common law action based on tort. Therefore, a
suit for perpetual injunction to restrain the defendants not to pass off the
defendants' goods as those of the plaintiffs by using the plaintiff's
trademark and for damages is an action at common law and is not barred by
Section 69(2). Likewise, if the relief of permanent injunction or damages are
being claimed on the basis of a registered trademark and its infringement, the
suit is to be treated as one based on a statutory right under the Trade Marks
Act and is not barred by Section 69(2). Therefore, in both these situations,
the unregistered partnership in the present case cannot be said to be
enforcing the right 'arising from a contract'. Therefore, the rulings relied
upon by the defendant in AIR 2009 HP 10 & AIR 2002 Kerala 33 are not
applicable to  21 O.S.No.4514/2015 the facts and circumstances of this case.
As the plaintiff has proved the ownership of trademark by producing the legal
use certificates which was in existence from 1989 and at the time of filing
the suit though Ex.P1, 7 to 10. Hence, I answer the issue No.1 in the
affirmative.
20\. Issue No.2 & 3 : Since these two issues are interlinked they are taken up
together to avoid repetition. The Plaintiff in order to substantiate its claim
the Plaintiff has contended in its plaint that the Defendant has commenced
their restaurant by name NANDINI VEG by using the Plaintiff's well established
Trademark NANDHINI DELUXE. The action of the Defendant is fraudulent, illegal
and contrary to law and unauthorised and calculated to deceive the customers.
The Plaintiff has also reiterated the plaint averments in his evidence with
reference to use of the registered Trademark by the Defendant. The Plaintiff
has relied on the Ex.P11 & P12 the bills, Ex.P13 & 14 the photograph showing
the name of Defendant as NANDINI VEG. In Ex.P11 & 12 are the bills wherein it
is written with heading NANDINI VEG. The plaintiff has also relied upon the
reply notice send to the plaintiff to its legal notice dtd.31.3.2015 Ex.P4 the
defendant in its reply dtd.18.4.2015 as per Ex.P6 in para 2 of the said notice
22 O.S.No.4514/2015 has contended that the defendant's trade name NANDINI VEG
is not similar to NANDHINI DELUXE Restaurant and it is common in general and
used by the public. The defendant in his written statement which was filed on
3.11.2016 has also contended that the plaintiff's name NANDHINI DELUXE and the
defendant's trade name NANDINI VEG are not one and the same, both are
different. The plaintiff has also relied upon affidavit of defendant in lieu
of examination in chief wherein the defendant has admitted that he is running
a Udupi Style Vegetarian self service restaurant by name NANDINI VEG. Even in
his cross examination on 18.12.2019 also the defendant has deposed that "it is
correct to suggest that I am still running a hotel by name NANDINI VEG".
21\. The Plaintiff in his argument has contended that the Plaintiff's business
is located near Bangalore railway station. The Defendant is also running a
business of similar business near Plaintiff's business. There are many
commuters who come from bus stop and railway station and other places. Hence,
there are chances of mislead by the Defendant's trade name NANDINI VEG. The
goodwill of the NANDHINI DELUXE has been used by the defendant. The Defendant
in its written statement has contended that the word NANDHINI is sacred, the
23 O.S.No.4514/2015 counsel has also argued that the word NANDHINI is used by
many people in and around Bangalore, the Defendant is running a small canteen
and its Trademark is not deceptively similar to the registered Trademark of
the Plaintiff. The word NANDHINI DELUXE and NANDINI VEG are completely
different, it will not mislead any customers and also contended that the
Plaintiff is serving Andhra Style Food and the Defendant is serving Udupi
Style Food. So there is no confusion in the mind of the public.
22\. I have perused the contention of both the parties in their pleadings and
perused the deposition of Plaintiff and Defendant in entirety. The facts that
emerge from the pleadings, depositions, and documents are that the fact that
the Defendant is running a business NANDINI VEG since 2013. Hence, it is
undisputed that they were running the business under the name and style of
NANDINI VEG. Since the defendant has admitted running of NANDINI VEG no
further evidence is required by the plaintiff to show that the defendant is
running a hotel in the name and style of NANDINI VEG. Sec.58 of Indian
Evidence Act states that the facts admitted need not be proved. The very
provision is aptly applicable to this case. Even the word NANDINI contained in
Ex.11 to  24 O.S.No.4514/2015 14 ie., bills of the defendant's, trademark and
name board are phonetically and deceptively similar to Ex.P2 & 3 ie., menu
card and plastic carry bag of the plaintiff.
23\. The law relating to suit against infringement and passing off of the
trademark is well settled. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhavnesh Mohanlal Amin
v. Nirma chemicals Works Ltd n 2005 (9) Scale 158 held that the trademark NIMA
is deceptively similar to the registered trademark NIRMA in appearance as well
as pronunciation and hence amounts to infringement and hence upheld the
decision of the trial court of granting injunction.
In Ruston and Hornby Limited v. Zamindara Engineering Company (1969) 2 SCC 727
: AIR 1970 SC 1649, has observed that gist of a passing off action is that A
is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B in the minds of
customers.
In Halsbury (Trade Marks, 4th Edn., 1984, Vol. 48, para 187) says that in a
passing-off action the degree of similarity of the name, mark or other
features concerned is important but not necessarily decisive, so that an
action for infringement of a registered trade mark may  25 O.S.No.4514/2015
succeed on the same facts where a passing-off action fails or vice versa.
As to vice versa, Kerly says ((Kerly, Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 11th
Ed. 1983, para 16.12), an infringement action may fail where the plaintiff
cannot prove registration or that its registration extends to the goods or to
all the goods in question or because the registration is invalid and yet the
plaintiff may show that by imitating the mark or otherwise, the defendant has
done what is calculated to pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff.
The House of Lords in the case of Reckitt & Colman Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] 1
All E.R. 873 has restated three elements of passing off. I.e., Reputation,
Misrepresentation and Damage to goodwill are also known as the CLASSICAL
TRINITY. It was stated in this case that in a suit for passing off the
plaintiff must establish firstly, goodwill or reputation attached to his goods
or services. Secondly, he must prove a misrepresentation by the defendant to
the public i.e. leading or likely to lead the public to believe that the goods
and services offered by him are that of the plaintiff's. Lastly, he must
demonstrate that he has  26 O.S.No.4514/2015 suffered a loss due to the belief
that the defendant's goods and services are those of the plaintiff's.
In Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens 1905 22 RPC 601 HL Lord Halsbury said, while
dealing with a passing-off action that the whole question in these cases is
whether the thing taken in its entirety, looking at the whole thing is such
that in the ordinary course of things a person with reasonable comprehension
and with proper insight would be deceived.
         In   a   Cadila    Health    Care    Ltd.     v.   Cadila
    Pharmaceuticals Ltd.. 2001 5 SCC 73          (Three Judges
Bench) Hon'ble Supreme Court, summed up the position of law regarding tests to
determine a passing-off action, with the following observations: (SCC pp. 88 &
95, paras 18 & 35-37) We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observations
in Dyechem case. As far as this Court is concerned, the decisions in the last
four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the case of a
passing-off action is the similarity between the competing marks and to
determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing confusion. This
is evident from the decisions of this Court in the cases of Amritdhara
Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta , AIR 1963 SC 449, Durga Dutt Sharma case Durga
Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC  27
O.S.No.4514/2015 980, and Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. Ltd. case Hoffmann-La Roche
& Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner & Co. P Ltd., 1969 2 SCC 716. Having come to the
conclusion, in our opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential
features is relevant, this Court in Dyechem case sought to examine the
difference in the two marks piknik and picnic. It applied three tests, they
being:
(1) is there any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied?
(2) mode in which the parts are put together differently i.e whether
dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing
dissimilar, and (3) whether, when there are common elements, should one not
pay more regard to the parts which are not common, while at the same time not
disregarding the common parts? In examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid
three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the manner in which the
two words were written and the peculiarity of the script and concluded (at SCC
p. 597, para 39) that the above three dissimilarities have to be given more
importance than the phonetic similarity or the similarity in the use of the
word picnic for piknik.*** Para 35. Broadly stated, in an action for passing-
off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally for deciding the
question of deceptive similarity the following factors are to be considered:
28 O.S.No.4514/2015
> (a) The nature of the marks i.e whether the marks are word marks or label
> marks or composite marks i.e both words and label works.
> (b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and
> hence similar in idea.
> (c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade
> marks.
> (d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of
> the rival traders.
> (e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the
> marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care
> they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.
> (f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.
> (g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent
> of dissimilarity between the competing marks.
> Para 36. Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depending
> upon facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each
> factor in every case.
> Para 37. The trial court will now decide the suit keeping in view the
> observations made in this judgment.
In F. Hoffmanny. V. La Roche and Co. v. Georfferv Manners and Co., AIR 1970 SC
2062 it was laid down thus:
29 O.S.No.4514/2015
> (i) In order that a trade mark may be found deceptively similar to another
> it is not necessary that it 'should be intended to deceive or intended to
> cause confusion. It is its probable effect on the ordinary kind of customers
> that one has to consider. For this purpose it is necessary to apply both the
> visual and phonetic tests. It is also important that the marks should be
> compared as wholes. It is not right to take a portion of the word and say
> that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion
> of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause
> confusion. The true test is whether the totality of the trade mark is such
> that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of
> the persons accustomed to the existing trade mark.
24\. In a suit for infringement or passing off of a trademark the plaintiff in
order to succeed in the suit the plaintiff must show that the defendant must
have sold its goods or offered the services in a manner which has deceived or
to be likely to deceive the public into thinking that the defendant's good or
services are of the plaintiff. The plaintiff in a suit for passing off action
has to show that misrepresentation by the defendant to the public is likely to
cause confusion in the mind of the public. As per Section 28 of the Trade
Marks Act it gives a exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to goods
or services  30 O.S.No.4514/2015 in respect of which the trademark is
registered to obtain a relief in respect of infringement. By perusing the
entire material on record I am of the opinion that the use of the word NANDINI
by the Defendant is deceptively similar to registered word NANDHINI of the
plaintiff thereby defendant has infringed and passed off its goods as that of
the Plaintiff by using the offending name NANDINI VEG. Hence I answer the
above two issues in the affirmative.
25\. Issue No.4: Inview of the findings on issue No.1 to 3 Plaintiff is
entitled for the relief of permanent and mandatory injunction as prayed.
26\. Point No.5: Plaintiff had contended that Defendant by fraudulently
adopted the mark NANDINI VEG for providing food in order to deceive the
customers and to encash the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff. So by
using the mark NANDINI VEG there is damages caused to the Plaintiff. So they
have claimed damages of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of suit. The
Plaintiff in its plaint has given the list of sales turnover from the year
1989-90 till 2014-15. However the Plaintiff has not produced any documents or
account statement in support of the same, so as to make out their income  31
O.S.No.4514/2015 per month and damages that is caused from the date of filing
the suit till the date of disposal. The Plaintiff has also not shown what is
the actual damages or loss caused to the Plaintiff after commencement of
business by the Defendant. It is also settled principle of law that in a
remedy of damages on passing off, the plaintiff can either claim damages or
account of profit and not both.
In the decision of Infosvs Technologies Ltd v. Park Infosvs & Ors 2007 (34)
PTC 178 (Del). The court while granting permanent injunction restraining the
defendant from doing business under the name "Park Infosys", the court refused
to grant damages. The court held that in the absence of any proofofdamages,
the plaintiffis not entitled to any damages.
Dormeuil Freres SA -Vs- Feraglow [1990] RPC 449 it was held that : An award of
damages in Trademark disputes is essentially an attempt to put the proprietor
into the same position as if the infringement had not occurred. This means
that any damages awarded will be compensatory rather than punitive or
exemplary. The methodology used to calculate what compensation is deemed
appropriate in the circumstances is often by reference to the "notional
reasonable licence" i.e. if the  32 O.S.No.4514/2015 infringer was a licensee
under an arms length agreement, what royalty would have been expected.
27\. In the present case, the plaintiff has not able to prove either the
profits derived by the defendant from its illegal activities or such sales
record to establish the loss. So in the circumstances, in the event of
Plaintiff having failed to prove the damages having caused, there is no
question of calling for the Defendant to render the true account and also
Plaintiff being entitled for any damages. In the circumstances I hold the
above point in the negative.
28\. Point No.6: In the result I proceed to pass the following:
> ORD ER The suit is decreed in part with costs.
> The Defendants, their servants, agents, or any one claiming through them in
> any manner are hereby restrained by way of permanent injunction from
> infringing and passing off the Plaintiff's Trademark NANDHINI DELUXE/
> NANDHINI or any other trade mark which are deceptively similar to their
> registered trade mark NANDINI for running Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian  33
> O.S.No.4514/2015 Restaurant by using offending name NANDINI VEG.
> Inview of the suit having decreed Defendant shall surrender to the Plaintiff
> any unused bills, packaging cover or any such materials with mark NANDINI
> VEG.
> Draw decree accordingly.
