This is assessee appeal for the A.Y 2014-15. In this appeal, the assessee is
aggrieved by the order of the CIT(A)- 3, Hyderabad, dated 22.05.2017. The
assessee has raised the following grounds of appeal:

2\. Brief facts of the case are that the assessee company, engaged in the
business of manufacturing machinery used in Rice Mills, filed its return of
income for the A.Y 2014-15 on 30-11-2014 admitting total income at Rs. Nil.
During the assessment proceedings u/s 143(3) of the IT Act, the A.O observed
that the assessee has debited a sum of Rs. 3,79,42,277/- under "extra ordinary
items" and a note was furnished as under:
> " This comprises of loss on destruction of machinery. The company had
> imported machinery for modernization of certain operations during the year.
> After clearance by the customs authorities at Chennai, the truck carrying
> the  3 ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad.
> machinery to the company's f actory at Hyderabad capsized in Chennai,
> resulting in severe damage to one of the machines rendering it unfit for
> use. The insurance company is yet to adjudicate the claim for loss. The loss
> on destruction of the machine of Rs. 3,79,42,277/-, being loss incidental to
> business, has been charged to the statement of profit and loss. On
> adjudication and settlement of insurance claim, the same will be accounted
> for as revenue in the relevant year"
2.1 The A.O observed that the loss incurred was towards destruction of
machinery which is capital in nature. Therefore, the assessee was asked to
explain as to why the said loss, debited to profit and loss account, should
not be disallowed, the same being capital in nature. The assessee vide letter
dated 14-10-2016, submitted that the said machinery was imported from Germany
during the relevant financial year and the machinery, after customs clearance
at Chennai, was loaded onto a truck for transportation to the company's
factory at Hyderabad, but just outside the warehouse at Chennai, the truck
capsized and extensive damage was caused to the machinery in July 2013. It was
submitted that the company had imported the machinery duty free on the basis
of an export obligation guarantee and since the machinery was damaged and
cannot be put to use, the company had to pay customs duty along with interest
computed from the date of import, and hence the  4 ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s
Suri Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad. loss of destruction of machine at Rs.
3,79,42,277/-, being loss incidental to business, has been charged to the
statement of profit and loss account and claimed while arriving at taxable
income and relied on supporting case law. The A.O, however, observed that the
case law relied upon by the assessee were distinguishable on facts. Further,
from the notes forming part the financial statements furnished by the
assessee, he observed the CIF value of imports in relation to capital goods
were shown as Rs. 3,25,12,754/- and therefore, he was of the opinion that the
said machinery is a capital asset which is intended to be used in
manufacturing of its products i.e Rice Mill machinery and parts thereof. He
therefore, held that the loss or damage of machinery is capital in nature and
hence cannot be allowed. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred an appeal before
the CIT(A).
3\. In the meantime, the assessee's claim was accepted by the insurance
company at a sum of Rs. 1,26,35,109/- as a full and final settlement of claim.
The assessee did not accept the offer and filed a suit in Hon'ble Madras High
Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court passed an interim order on 16-08-2016
directing the insurance company to  5 ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri Engineers
Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad. pay a sum of Rs. 1,26,35,109/-, i.e the amount agreed to
by the insurance company pending final result in the pending suit. The above
amount was received by the assessee on 02-05-2017, and thereafter, the
assessee reduced the said compensation received from the insurance company
from the claim and modified the claim to Rs. 2,53,07,168/-.
4\. The CIT(A), observed that the machinery imported did not reach the factory
premises of the assessee and was not included in the block of assets and was
not put to use and since machinery met with an accident and got damaged, the
amount paid to German Company would only be a balance sheet item as an advance
paid for the 'asset'. He observed that the amounts received from New India
Assurance Company of Rs. 1,26,35,109/- would again be a balance sheet item
under the head 'payable to insurance company' and that the said quantum of
liability would be known after the insurance claim is crystalized. In these
circumstances, she held that the amount of loss of Rs. 2,53,07,168/- cannot be
allowed in advance, pending its crystallization, and that as and when the
amount is crystalized in future, the same has to be allowed to the  6 ITA No.
1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad. assessee. Aggrieved by
this direction of the CIT(A), the assessee is in appeal before us.
5\. The Ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted that, the assessee had imported
the machinery from Germany in order to update its machinery and in order to
increase in profit earning capacity. He submitted that, since the machinery
was never put to use, it cannot be referred to as a 'capital asset' as rightly
held by the CIT(A). He submitted that the department has not appealed against
the finding of the CIT(A) that the loss is allowable in the year of
crystallization and therefore the said finding has become final. He submitted
that the loss is allowable in the year of incurring the loss and as and when
the assessee receives the claim from the insurance company, it would reflect
the same as income during the year of receipt u/s 41(1) of the IT Act.
Therefore, according to him, no prejudice was caused to the revenue and in
fact it has be allowed during the relevant assessment year. In support of his
contentions, he placed reliance upon the following case law:
> a. Badridas Daga Vs. CIT 34 ITR 10 (SC).
> b. Ramchander Shivnarayan 111 ITR 263 (SC).
7
> ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad.

7\. Having regard to the rival contentions and the material placed on record,
we find that the machinery has been imported by the assessee but before it
could be transported to the assessee's premises at Hyderabad and installed and
thereafter put to use, the machinery got damaged. There is no doubt that the
machinery has been imported for increasing the profit earning capacity of the
assessee and therefore, it is for the business of the assessee. Any
expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of
the assessee has to be allowed u/s 37(1) of the Act. In the case of Badridas
Daga (cited supra) relied upon by the assessee, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that where there is no provision for a deduction, the tax of admissibility of
such a deduction  8 ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri Engineers Pvt. Ltd.,
Hyderabad. depends on accepted commercial practice and principles and that the
loss incurred while carrying on of business has to be allowed, unless it is
expressly or impliedly prohibited. In the case of National bank Ltd., the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the trading loss of a business is allowable in
computing the profit earned by the business. In the case before us, since the
machinery has not been installed and put to use by the assessee, the assessee
cannot capitalize the same and the depreciation thereon cannot be allowed. An
expense is capitalized when it is recorded as an asset, due to its future
value on the balance sheet, rather than as an expense in the income statement.
Since the machinery got damaged even before it reached the assessee's
premises, and it had no future value, it was an expense. The CIT(A) has, in
fact accepted that this amount is allowable to the assessee but in the year of
crystalization. The reason for confirming the disallowance is that the loss
has not crystalized during the year, as the appeal by the assessee against the
insurance company is still pending before the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. We
agree with the Ld. counsel for the assessee, that the business loss has
occurred and is allowable to the assessee  9 ITA No. 1387/Hyd/2017 M/s Suri
Engineers Pvt. Ltd., Hyderabad. in the relevant assessment year and as and
when the compensation is finalized by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras, and
the assessee receives it, it would have to offer the same to taxation in such
assessment year of receipt. The finding of the CIT(A) has not been challenged
by the revenue and therefore it has become final. Therefore, we direct the A.O
to allow the business loss during the relevant assessment year before us.
8\. In the result, the assessee appeal is allowed.
