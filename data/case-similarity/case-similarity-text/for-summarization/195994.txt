8\. The above interpretation gets support from the use of the term 'damages',
and not 'rents', in the compromise petition as well as the order of the
Executing Court. The view we have taken gets support also from a decision of
this Court reported in [1968] 2 SCR 559.(1). In that case, the appellant filed
a suit for eviction of the respondent from the appellant's house. The suit was
dismissed by the trial court In appeal compromise was entered into between the
parties and the decree was passed in terms of the compromise. The compromise
provided for the respondent's continuation of possession of the house for five
years, but it enabled the appellant to execute the decree by evicting the
respondent, if the latter failed to pay rent for three consecutive months.
When the appellant sought to evict the respondent, the latter claimed
protection from eviction on the ground that the compromise decree created a
lease. It was held by this Court that the facts that the appellant had filed a
suit for eviction of the respondent and the compromise decree enabled him to
execute the decree by evicting the respondent, showed that the intention of
the parties, which was the decisive test, was not to enter into a relationship

    HEADNOTE:
         The predecessor  of the  respondents filed	 a suit	 for
    eviction of  the predecessor  of the  appellants from a shop
    and obtained  a decree	on March  21, 1960 for eviction. The
    decree-holder filed  an application for the execution of the
    decree on  March 22,  1966 and	during the pendency of these
    proceedings, a	compromise  was	 entered  into	between	 the
    parties, and the Executing Court passed an order dated March
    21, 1968 in terms of the compromise. The compromise provided
    for the	 judgment-debtor to  give vacant  possession of	 the
    remaining half	of the shop to the decree-holder by December
    31, 1972  and to  pay damages  for use and occupation by the
    5th of	every month  to the  decree-holder at  Rs. 110/- per
    month, and  that on six months damages being due the decree-
    holder will be entitled to have the shop vacated.
         The  decree-holder	 filed	an  execution  petition	 for
    recovery of  possession on  November 25,  1975 alleging that
    the judgment  debtor had not paid damages at the rate of Rs.
    110/- per  month from  July  1,	 1975.	The  judgment-debtor
    contested the  execution  proceedings  contending  that	 the
    terms of  compromise created  a fresh lease in favour of the
    judgment-debtor in  respect of	the remaining  half  of	 the
    shop, and  that the decree was therefore not executable. The
    Executing  Court  upheld  the  objection  holding  that	 the
    compromise dated March 21, 1968 amounted to a fresh lease.
         On appeal,	 the District  Judge, set aside the order of
    the Executing  Court, but  in Second  Appeal, the High Court
    upheld the  order of  the District  Judge, and dismissed the
    appeal.
         In the  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf
    of the	appellant/judgment-debtor, that the compromise dated
    March 21,  1968 created	 a fresh  lease, in  favour  of	 the
    judgment-debtor in  respect of	the undelivered	 half of the
    shop and the decree-holder's remedy was by way of a suit for
    recovery of possession.

         Dismissing the appeal,
    ^
         HELD: When	 a compromise  takes place  in the course of
    execution of  a	 decree	 for  eviction	the  compromise	 may
    extinguish the	decree and  create a  fresh  lease,  or	 the
    compromise may	provide a mere mode for the discharge of the
    decree. What actually takes place depends upon the intention
    of the	parties to  the compromise, and the intention has to
    be gathered  from  the	terms  of  the	compromise  and	 the
    surrounding circumstances  including the  order recorded  by
    the Court on the basis of the compromise. [205 C-D]
         In the  instant case  para 1 of the compromise petition
    and  the   order  of   the  Executing  Court  recording	 the
    compromise  disclose  the  intention  of  the  parties.	 The
    judgment-debtor had  already vacated  "half of	the shop and
    given its possession" and time was granted till December 31,
    1972 for  vacating and	delivering possession  of the  other
    half of	 the shop  as the  judgment-debtor wanted  time till
    then lest  his business "will be ruined by vacating the shop
    in hurry."  This shows that the intention of the parties was
    not to	create a  fresh lease  in respect of the half of the
    shop in possession of the judgment-debtor but to help him to
    find out alternative accommodation and time for vacating was
    given till  December 31,  1972. Further, the term 'damages',
    and not	 'rents' is  used in the compromise petition as well
    as the	order of  the Executing	 Court. The intention of the
    parties	 clearly  was  not  to	extinguish  the	 decree	 for
    eviction but to create a mode of its full discharge. [205 E-

    JUDGMENT:
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2612 of 1981\.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 6th January,
1981 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Jabalpur Bench) in M.P. No. 87 of 1980.
Amlan Ghosh for the Appellants.
Sobhagmal Jain and S.K. Jain for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court
was delivered by BAHARUL ISLAM, J. This appeal by special leave is by the
judgment-debtors. The material facts which are not in dispute may be stated
thus:
2\. The predecessor of the respondents (hereinafter referred to as 'the
decree-holder') filed a suit for eviction of the predecessor of the appellants
(hereinafter referred to as 'the judgment-debtor') and obtained a decree on
21.3.1960, inter alia, for eviction from a 203 shop. The decree-holder filed a
petition for execution of the decree for eviction in the executing court on
3.1.1961. The petition was dismissed on 20.1.1961. A fresh petition for
execution was filed on 19.1.1965. It was also dismissed on 20.3.1965. The
decree-holder again filed an application for execution of the decree on
22.6.1966. During the pendency of this execution proceeding, the parties filed
a compromise petition on 31.3.1968. The terms of the compromise on the
interpretation of which the result of this appeal depends were as follows:
> (Material portions only):
> "In the above case, a compromise has taken place between the parties as
> follows:
> (1) That for the present the judgment-debtor is not getting a shop. His
> established business will be ruined by vacating the shop in hurry.
> Therefore, the judgment-debtor wants time till 31.12.1972 from the decree-
> holder for vacating half the shop in his possession. So the judgment-debtor
> will vacate the shop and give possession thereof to the decree-holder by
> 31.12.1972. He has vacated half the shop and given its possession.
> (2) That during this period the judgment-debtor shall pay damages to the
> decree-holder for use of the shop @ 110/- per month.
> (3) That the damages shall be paid upto the 5th of every month. In the event
> of non-payment of damages for any six months, the decree-holder shall be
> entitled to get the shop immediately vacated, by filing execution, from the
> possession of the judgment-debtor, without any objection as regards
> limitation.
> (4) The decree-holder wants to have new shutters put up after removing the
> present shutters in the front portion of the shop. The judgment-debtor will
> not be entitled to object to this.
He will help in the putting of girders and he will vacate the portion.
If he will demur to it, the decree-holder can have the shop vacated, without
any objection as regards the above limitation.
204
So, the aforesaid compromise be accepted and kept on record."
3\. It is also not in dispute that at the time of the compromise, half of the
shop had been vacated and its possession delivered to the decree-holder as
stated in the compromise petition. In order to appreciate the intention of the
parties to the compromise, it is also necessary to refer to the order dated
21.3.1968 recorded by the execution court on the basis of the compromise. The
material para of the order is para 3 and it is in the following terms:
> "The judgment-debtor to give vacant possession of the shop to the decree-
> holder by 31.12.72 according to the compromise and he will pay damages for
> use and occupation by the 5th of every month to the decree- holder according
> to the compromise @ Rs. 110/- per month. On six months' damages being due,
> the decree- holder will be entitled to have the shop vacated. The decree-
> holder will provide shutters in the front portion. The judgment-debtor will
> not object to them. The case is decided in terms of the compromise. The
> compromise be recorded."
4\. On 25.11.1975, the decree-holder filed an execution petition for recovery
of possession of the portion of shop in possession of the judgment-debtor,
alleging that the judgment-debtor had not paid damages at the rate of Rs.
110/- per month from 1.7.1975. Notice of the execution petition was issued to
the judgment-debtor who appeared and raised several objections to the
execution proceedings. But we are concerned in this appeal only with one which
was that in terms of the compromise, a fresh lease was created in favour of
the judgment-debtor in respect of the remaining half of the shop. It was
therefore submitted that the decree was not executable. The Executing Court
upheld the objection holding that the compromise dated 21.3.1968 amounted to a
fresh lease. An appeal was taken to the Court of the District Judge who set
aside the order of the Executing Court. In a second appeal, the High Court
upheld the order of the District Judge, and dismissed the appeal. It is
against this order of the High Court is this appeal by special leave.
205
5\. The only point urged before us by Shri Amlan Ghosh, learned counsel for
the judgment-debtor was that the compromise dated 21.3.1968 created a fresh
lease in favour of the judgment-debtor in respect of the undelivered half of
the shop, and the decree-holder's remedy was by a suit for recovery of its
possession.
6\. When a compromise petition is filed in an execution proceeding, and a
contention is raised by the judgment- debtor on a subsequent execution being
started by the decree-holder that the compromise has given rise to a fresh
contract between the parties and that the decree sought to be executed is not
executable, what is to be seen is whether the decree has been extinguished as
a result of the compromise and a fresh contract has emerged. When a compromise
takes place in the course of execution of a decree-for eviction, the
compromise may extinguish the decree and create a fresh lease, or the
compromise may provide a mere mode for the discharge of the decree. What
actually takes place depends on the intention of the parties to the
compromise. And the intention has to be gathered from the terms of the
compromise and the surrounding circumstances including the order recorded by
the Court on the basis of the compromise.
7\. In the instant case, paragraph 1 of the compromise petition quoted above
and the order of the Executing Court recording the compromise are important
and disclose the intention of the parties. Paragraph 1 of the compromise
petition shows that the judgment-debtor had already "vacated half of the shop
and given its possession" and time was granted till 31.12.1972 for vacating
and delivering possession of the other half of the shop as the judgment-
debtor wanted time till then lest his business "will be ruined by vacating the
shop in hurry". This clearly shows that the intention of the parties was not
to create a fresh lease in respect of the half of the shop in possession of
the judgment-debtor, but to help the judgment-debtor find out, not in a hurry;
alternative accommodation for his shop so that his established business was
not 'ruined' and time for vacating the half of the room was given till
31.12.1972. And this was also how the compromise petition was understood by
the Executing Court when it recorded in para 3 of its order: "The judgment-
debtor to give vacant possession of the shop to the decree-holder by
31.12.1972 according to the compromise.....". The intention of the parties
clearly was not to extinguish the decree for eviction but to create a mode of
its full discharge.
206
8\. The above interpretation gets support from the use of the term 'damages',
and not 'rents', in the compromise petition as well as the order of the
Executing Court. The view we have taken gets support also from a decision of
this Court reported in [1968] 2 SCR 559.(1). In that case, the appellant filed
a suit for eviction of the respondent from the appellant's house. The suit was
dismissed by the trial court In appeal compromise was entered into between the
parties and the decree was passed in terms of the compromise. The compromise
provided for the respondent's continuation of possession of the house for five
years, but it enabled the appellant to execute the decree by evicting the
respondent, if the latter failed to pay rent for three consecutive months.
When the appellant sought to evict the respondent, the latter claimed
protection from eviction on the ground that the compromise decree created a
lease. It was held by this Court that the facts that the appellant had filed a
suit for eviction of the respondent and the compromise decree enabled him to
execute the decree by evicting the respondent, showed that the intention of
the parties, which was the decisive test, was not to enter into a relationship
of landlord and tenant.
9- This appeal has no merit and is dismissed with costs.
    N.V.K.					   Appeal dismissed.
