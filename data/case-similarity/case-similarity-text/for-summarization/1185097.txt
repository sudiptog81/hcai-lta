JUDGMENT S.B. Sinha, C.J.
1\. The vires of Sub-section (5) of Section 1 of the Employees State Insurance
Act, 1948 (hereinafter called and referred to for the sake of brevity as "the
said Act") is in question in this writ petition.
2\. The writ petitioner herein has also questioned an order dated 26th/28th
December 2001 issued by the Regional Director of the Employees State Insurance
Corporation whereby and whereunder its establishment was held to be covered
under the provisions of the said Act as also a notice dated 30th January 2002
in terms whereof the petitioner has been directed to deposit a sum of Rs.
11,61,875.00.
FACTS
3\. The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act. It
carries on business as a construction contractor.
4\. According to the petitioner, as neither at its registered office nor at
Tehsildar/Special Revenue Inspector (ESI) Recovery Cell and Ors. , 2002 (1)
ALT 262, wherein upon referring to the afore-mentioned decision of the Apex
Court in Employees' State Insurance Corporation v. F. Fibre Bangalore (P) Ltd.
(supra), it was held:
"5. Having regard to the aforementioned authoritative pronouncement of the
Apex Court, we are of the opinion that all questions, including the question
of applicability of the ESI Act to the petitioners, can be raised before the
Employees' Insurance Court. Therefore, the petitioners should avail the
remedies available to them."
"6. The above aspect of the matter was also considered by a Division Bench of
Patna High Court in Shriram bearings Ltd. v. E.S.I. Corporation (1977 Lab.
I.C. 1482 (Patna)(D.B.)), and N.P. Singh, J. as he then was, speaking for the
Bench categorically held that even the Courts and Tribunals constituted under
the ESI Act, have inherent power to issue appropriate relief by way of
injunction to the party before it and it can enforce the orders."
33\. For the reasons afore-mentioned, we are of the opinion that the writ
4\. According to the petitioner, as neither at its registered office nor at
construction sites any manufacturing activity is carried out, it does not come
within the expression "factory" as occurring in Section 2(12) of the Act. It
allegedly has employed less than 20 persons in its office. It has been
contended that the office of the company is not a "shop" inasmuch as there
does not exist any go-down nor any stock is stored therein far less any sale
or purchase is carried on from the said premises nor any services there from
are rendered to any customer.
5\. Admittedly, at the relevant point of time, the petitioner had construction
sites at the following places:
1) Nehru Place,
2) Rajendra Place, and
3) Lodhi Road.
6\. The petitioner would contend that by reason of Sub-section (5) of Section
1, Section 45A of the Act and Regulation 10B of the Employees State Insurance
(General) Regulations, 1950 (hereinafter called as "the Regulations"),
unguided, unbridled and naked power has been delegated upon the executive,
pursuant to or in furtherance whereof, the Government had been vested with
powers of specifying such establishment, as it may pick out, to be brought
within the purview thereof.
7\. On 25.5.1987 efforts of ESI Corporation to cover one of the sites i.e.
Centaur Hotel of the petitioner company, as "factory" were proved to be
abortive due to intervention of ESI Court in petitioner's favor. On 27.11.1989
after issuance of impugned notification dated 30.9.1988, the ESI Corporation
again tried to cover establishment of the petitioner company as "factory".
However, after exchange of correspondence between the petitioner and the
Corporation, the Corporation vide its letter dated 27.11.1989 admitted that
the establishment of the petitioner company was not a factory and in fact ESI
Corporation was not going to cover it as factory either under Section 2(12) or
1(5) of the ESI Act. On 5.1.1998 the Insurance Inspector issued notice for
inspection on 13.1.1998. The said Inspector was allegedly fully co-operated by
the petitioner company in exercise of her functions and discharging of duties
and no impediment or obstruction was created. The records of the petitioner
company were shown to her. Correspondences were exchanged between the
petitioner and the ESI Inspector and a Survey Report dated 6.2.1998 was also
prepared by the ESI Inspector. On 6.3.1998 despite the fact that the
petitioner company did not come within the purview of coverage of the Act and
the Scheme, ESI Corporation allotted a Code Number to it. Thereagainst, on
17.3.1998 petitioner company made representation whereby it objected to the
said stand of the ESI Corporation. Thereafter, on 13.4.1998 petitioner company
also sent a legal notice to the Corporation. On 28.9.2001 allegedly, after
sleeping for about two and half years, the ESI Corporation woke up and
abruptly, without application of mind, requested the petitioner to submit the
Returns of Contributions for Contribution period ended March 2001. This letter
was suitably replied by the petitioner vide its letter dated 22/23.11.2001. On
4/8.10.2001, Deputy Director of ESI Corporation for the first time replied to
petitioner's letter dated 17.3.1998 and Legal Notice dated 13.4.1998 and also
directed the petitioner to show cause under Section 44(2) of the ESI ACt on
24.10.2001. The petitioner company supplied the requisite documents to the
Deputy Director of the ESI Corporation and also showed cause. On 26/28.12.2001
Regional Director of ESI Corporation rejected all contentions of the
petitioner and vide his impugned order dated 26/28.12.2001 replied that the
establishment of the petitioner was covered under the ESI Act by virtue of
Notification issued on 30.9.1988. On 22.1.2002 the petitioner company again
clarified the purported illogical conclusions of the Regional Director of the
Corporation. Regional Director asked the petitioner company to present its
case before him on 24.1.2002 at 3 PM. However when the chief accountant of the
petitioner reached the office of the Regional Director, it transpired that he
was not available in the office and had gone for some meeting. Therefore, the
Chief Accountant of the petitioner sought for another opportunity of personal
hearing to present the case before the Regional Director but no opportunity
whatever was granted. On 30.1.2002, Deputy Director of the ESI Corporation
issued the impugned notice to show cause dated 30.1.2002 to the petitioner. In
terms of the said notice, a sum of Rs. 11,61,875.00 was computed on ad-hoc
basis as contributions for the period from 1.11.1997 to 31.12.2001. On
26.2.2002 cause was shown to the Deputy Director of the Corporation and reply
dated 25.2.2002 was filed. On 22.3.2002 Deputy Director of the Corporation,
without appreciating the facts stated by the petitioner company, passed the
impugned order and confirmed the ad hoc assessment. By means of the impugned
order Deputy Director of the Corporation directed the petitioner company to
pay contributions amounting to Rs. 11,61,875.00 for the period from 1.11.1997
to 31.12.2001 along with interest @ 15% per annum within 15 days and has
threatened to recover the same as arrears of Land Revenue.
SUBMISSIONS:
8\. Mr. Bhandari, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
would argue that Sub-section (5)( of Section 1, Section 45A of the Act and
Regulation 10B of the Regulations are ultra vires the Constitution of India
inasmuch as by reason thereof, the appropriate Government, without any
guidelines whatsoever, may extend the provisions of the said Act irrespective
of the nature of business, financial capacity, length of period or such other
relevant factors. The learned counsel would contend that from several
notifications, it would appear that categories of the establishments had been
mentioned therein to bring the same within the purview of the provisions of
the said Act but by reason of the impugned notifications, all establishments
have been brought within the purview thereof without classifying the nature of
business, financial capacity, length of period of business and thus the same
must be held to be ultra vires.
9\. According to the learned counsel, "go-down" would not come within the
purview of definition of "shop" nor the many offices of the petitioners would
come within the purview thereof. The learned counsel would contend that for
the self-same reasons, Section 45A of the Act and Regulation 10B of the
Regulations must also be declared ultra vires. Strong reliance in this
connection has been placed on Hamdard Dawakhana and Anr. v. Union of India and
Ors. , .
10\. According to the learned counsel, by reason of the impugned order dated
26th/28th December 2001, it had incorrectly been held that the employees
working in the company's branch office or godown are covered within the
meaning of provisions of the said Act and consequently the notice of demand
dated 30th January 2002 must also be held to be illegal.
FINDINGS:
11\. Sections 1(5), 45A of the Act and Regulation 10B of the Regulations read
thus:
1\. Short title, extend, commencement and application.-(5) The appropriate
Government may, in consultation with the corporation and where the appropriate
Government is a State Government, with the approval of the Central Government,
after giving six months' notice of its intention of so doing by notification
in the Official Gazette, extend the provisions of this Act or any of them, to
any other establishment or class of establishment, industrial, commercial,
agricultural or otherwise:
Provided that where the provisions of this Act have been brought into force in
any part of a State, the said provisions shall stand extended to any such
establishment or class of establishments within that part if the provisions
have already been extended to similar establishment or class of establishment
in another part of that State.
"45A. Determination of Contributions in certain cases.-(1) Where in respect of
a factory or establishment no returns, particulars, registers or records are
submitted, furnished or maintained in accordance with the provisions of
Section 44 or any Inspector or other official of the Corporation referred to
in Sub-section (2) of Section 45 is prevented in any manner by the principal
or immediate employer or any other person, in exercising his functions or
discharging his duties under Section 45, the Corporation may, on the basis of
information available to it, by order, determine the amount of contributions
payable in respect of the employees of that factory or establishment:
Provided that no such order shall be passed by the Corporation unless the
principal or immediate employer or the person in charge of the factory or
establishment has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
(2) An order made by the Corporation under Sub-section (1) shall be sufficient
proof of the claim of the Corporation under Section 75 or for recovery of the
amount determined by such order as an arrear of land revenue under Section 45B
or the recovery under Sections 45C to 45I.
10B. Registration of Factories or Establishment.-(a) The employer in respect
of a factory or an establishment to which the Act applies for the first time
and to which an Employer's Code Number is not yet allotted and the employer in
respect of a factory or an establishment to which the Act previously applied
but has ceased to apply for the time being, shall furnish to the appropriate
Regional Office not later than 15 days after the Act becomes applicable, as
the case may be, to the factory or establishment, a declaration for
registration in writing in Form 01 (hereinafter referred to as Employer's
Registration Form).
(b) The employer shall be responsible for the correctness of all the
particulars and information required for and furnished on the Employer's
Registration Form.
(c) The appropriate Regional Office may direct the employer who fails to
comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this regulation within the
time stated therein, to furnish to that office Employer's Registration Form
duly completed within such further time as may be specified and such employer
shall thereupon comply with the instructions, issued by that office in this
behalf.
(d) Upon receipt of the completed Employer's Registration Form, the
appropriate Regional Office shall, if satisfied that the factory or the
establishment is one to which the Act applies, allot to it on Employer's Code
Number (unless the factory or the establishment has already been allotted an
Employer's Code Number) and shall inform the employer of that number.
(e) The employer shall enter the Employer's Code Number on all documents
prepared or completed by him in connection with the Act, the rules and
regulations and in all correspondence with the appropriate office.
12\. The said Act was enacted to provide for certain benefits to employees in
case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and to make provisions for
certain other matters in relation thereto. The said Act, at the first
instance, was to apply to all factories other than seasonal factories. By
reason of Sub-section (5) of Section 1, the Appropriate Government has been
conferred with the power to extend the provisions of the said Act or any one
of them to any other establishments or class of establishments, industrial,
commercial, agricultural or otherwise in consultation with the Corporation and
where the Appropriate Government is a State, with the approval of the Central
Government and upon giving six months' notice of its intention of so doing by
notification in the Official Gazette.
13\. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that the legislature, by reason of
such a provision, can delegate its power to an appropriate Government for
extending the provisions of the Act. How far and to what extend the provisions
of the Act are to be extended, is a matter of legislative policy. In exercise
of its power under Sub-section (5) of Section 1 of the Act, the Appropriate
Government exercises a legislative function and not an executive function. The
court, in exercise of its power of judicial review could only interfere
therewith if such a provision was held to be arbitrary and thus hit by Article
14 of the Constitution of India. Except in a case where the principles of
Wednesbury unreasonableness is attracted, the court would not interfere with
any policy decision of a statutory authority, far less a legislative policy.
14\. The contention of Mr. Bhandari to the effect that no guideline has been
provided in terms of the said provision is stated to be rejected. The opinion
which is require to be formed by the Appropriate Authority in such matters
would be upon consideration of all relevant factors. Not only prior to
exercise of the said power, the Appropriate Government is required to give six
months' notice of its intention to do so, by a notification in the Official
Gazette, it has to consult the Employees State Insurance Corporation in
relation thereto. Furthermore, in the event the Appropriate Government is the
State Government, it is also required to obtain the approval of the Central
Government. Sufficient statutory safeguards have thus been provided. In the
event, the establishment which would be affected by reason of such an order of
extension intends to file an objection, it may do so within the afore-
mentioned period of six months which inter alia would have to be taken into
consideration by the appropriate authorities.
15\. We, therefore, find no reason as to why Sub-section (5) of Section 1 of
the Act should be declared ultra vires.
16\. In Hamdard Dawakhana and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. (supra),
whereupon Mr. Bhandari has placed strong reliance, the provisions were found
to be absolutely vague and ambiguous. By reason of the provisions impugned
therein, advertisements in respect of magic remedies were prohibited. Before
the Apex Court, the question was raised as to whether Section 3 of the Act
wherein it was stated "or any other disease or condition which may be
specified in the rules made under the Act", which was impugned therein
conferred a power of delegation or conditional legislation. The distinction
between a conditional legislation and delegated legislation was pointed out
stating:
"29. ...that in the former the delegate's power is that of determining when a
legislative declared rule of conduct shall become effective; Hampton & Co. v.
United States, (1927) 276 US 394, and the latter involves delegation of rule
making power which constitutionally may be exercised by the administrative
agent. This means that the legislature having laid down the broad principles
of its policy in the legislation can then leave the details to be supplied by
the administrative authority. In other words by delegated legislation the
delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within the limits
prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional legislation the power
of legislation is exercised by the legislature conditionally leaving to the
discretion of an external authority the time and manner of carrying its
legislation into effect as also the determination of the area to which it is
to extend..."
It was held:
34 "...In our view the words impugned are vague. Parliament has established no
criteria, no standards and has not prescribed any principle on which a
particular disease or condition is to be specified in the Schedule. It is not
stated what facts or circumstances are to be taken into consideration to
include a particular condition or disease. The power of specifying disease and
conditions as given in Section 3(d) must therefore be held to be going beyond
permissible boundaries of valid delegation. As a consequence the Schedule in
the rules must be struck down. But that would not affect such conditions and
diseases which properly fall within the four clauses of Section 3 excluding
the portion of Clause (d) which has been declared to be unconstitutional..."
17\. In the instant case, the provisions are absolutely clear and unambiguous.
18\. Without referring to a large number of case laws, we may refer to the
following passage from Dr. D.D. Basu's Shorter Constitution of India as regard
the legal position in relation to conditional and subordinate legislation -
permissibility of indicating conditional and subordinate legislation making-
"Conditional and Subordinate Legislation permissible. - But though the
Legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative functions, it can
entrust the administrative or application of a law to the Executive or some
other body. Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India, . Thus, after laying down the
legislative policy -
(i) The Legislature may leave it to the judgment of a local administrative
body as to the necessity of applying or introducing the Act in a local area;
or the determination of a contingency or even, upon the happening of which the
legislative provisions are made to operate. Expari Chinna Krishan Moorthy v.
State of Orissa, ; Papiah N.K. v. Excise Commr. , ; In re Delhi Law Act,
(1951) SCR 747;
Bhatnagars & Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, :
Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan, . This is known as 'conditional
legislation'.
(ii) The Legislature may lay down the policy of the legislation and then leave
to a subordinate body or agency, the power of making rules and regulations for
filing in the details to carry out the purposes of the legislation. When
legislative power is so exercised by an administrative or other subordinate
body, under statutory authority, it is known as 'subordinate legislation'. On
the part of the Legislature, it is delegated legislation, but it is a
permissible delegation if it has laid down the policy. On the other hand, it
will be unconstitutional as 'excessive delegation' if the Legislature
abdicates its essential legislative function or power in favor of some other
body.
19\. In Khoday Distilleries Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and Ors. ,
(1996) 10 SC 304(314), the law was state din the following terms:
"13. It is next submitted before us that the amended Rules are arbitrary,
unreasonable and cause undue hardship and, therefore, violate Article 14 of
the Constitution. Although the protection of Article 19(1)(g) may not be
available to the appellants, the rules must, undoubtedly, satisfy the test of
Article 14, which is a guarantee against arbitrary action. However, one must
bear in mind that what is being challenged here under Article 14 is not
executive action but delegated legislation. The tests of arbitrary action
which apply to executive actions do not necessarily apply to delegated
legislation. In order that delegated legislation can be struck down, such
legislation must be manifestly arbitrary; a law which could not be reasonably
expected to emanate from an authority delegated with the law-making power. In
the case of Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay)(P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (SCR
at p. 243) this Court said that a piece of subordinate legislation does not
carry the same degree of immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a
competent legislature. A subordinate legislation may be questioned under
Article 14 on the ground that it is unreasonable;
"unreasonable not in the sense of not being reasonable, but in the sense that
it is manifestly arbitrary". Drawing a comparison between the law in England
and in India, the Court further observed that in England the Judges would say,
"Parliament never intended the authority to make such Rules; they are
unreasonable and ultra vires". In India, arbitrariness is not a separate
ground since it will come within the embargo of Article 14 of the
Constitution. But subordinate legislation must be so arbitrary that it could
not be said to be in conformity with the statute or that it offends Article 14
of the Constitution."
20\. The decision of the apex court in Hamdard Dawakhana (supra), therefore,
in our opinion is clearly inapplicable in the instant case.
21\. The question as to whether a premises is a "shop" or not will depend upon
the facts and circumstances of each case. But only because, according to the
petitioner, the premises do not come within the purview of definition of
"shop, the court would jump to the conclusion that the relevant provisions of
the Act are unconstitutional.
22\. In Kirloskar Consultant Ltd. v. Employee' State Insurance Corporation,
(2001) 1 SCC 57, a business of consultancy service to its consumer was held to
come within the purview of definition of shop. The Apex Court held that the
word "shop" has acquired as expanded meaning.
23\. Yet again in Christian Medical College v. Employees' State Insurance
Corporation, (2001) 1 SCC 256, the Apex Court held that in a case of this
nature, the dominant nature test should be applied.
24\. Yet again in Southern Agencies, Rajahmundry v. A.P. Employees' State
Insurance Corporation, (2001) 1 SCC 411, an administrative office of
partnership firm concluding and supervising sales, taking in different
branches was held to be covered under the definition of shop.
25\. We, therefore, fail to see any reason as to why Sub-section (5) of
Section 1 of the Act can be held to be ultra vires.
26\. As has been quoted hereinbefore, by reason of Section 45A of the Act, a
power has been conferred upon the authorities to determine contributions of
the employer in certain cases.
27\. We fail to see as to how such a machinery provision can be said to be
ultra vires the Constitution of India.
28\. Regulation 10B is merely a procedural provision. We fail to comprehend as
to how such a provision can be said to be unconstitution.
29\. So far as the legality of impugned order and the demand notice is
concerned, in our opinion, having regard to the provisions contained in
Sections 74 and 75 of the Act, the remedy of the petitioner would be to file
an appropriate application before the Employees State Insurance Court.
Sections 74(1) and 75 read thus:
Section 74. Constitution of Employees' Insurance Court.-(1) the State
Government shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute an
Employees' Insurance Court for such local area as may be specified in the
notification.
Section 75. Matters to be decided by Employees' Insurance Court.-(1) If any
question or dispute arises as to-
(a) Whether any person is an employee within the meaning of this Act whether
he is liable to pay the employee's contribution, or
(b) the rate of wages or average daily wages of an employee for the purposes
of this Act, or
(c) the rate of contribution payable by a principle employer in respect of any
employee, or
(d) the person who is or was the principal employer in respect of any
employee, or
(e) the right of any person to any benefit and as to the amount and duration
thereof, or (ee) any direction issued by the Corporation under Section 55A on
a review of any payment of dependants' benefit, or
(f) omitted by Act 44 of 1966, Section 32 (w.e.f. 28-1-1968)
(g) any other matter which is in dispute between a principal employer and the
Corporation, or between a principal employer and an immediate employer or
between a person and the Corporation or between an employer and a principal or
immediate employer, in respect of any contribution or benefit or other dues
payable or recoverable under this Act. Or any other matter required to be or
which may be decided by the Employees' Insurance Court under this Act.
Such question or dispute subject to the provisions of Sub-section (2A) shall
be decided by the Employees' Insurance Court in accordance with the provisions
of this Act.
(2) Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (2A), the following claims shall
be decided by the Employees' Insurance Court, namely:-
(a) claim for the recovery of contributions from the principal employer;
(b) claim by a principal employer to recover contributions from any immediate
employer;
(c) omitted by Act 44 of 1966 Section 32 (w.e.f. 28.1.1968)
(d) claim against a principal employer under Section 68;
(e) claim under Section 70 for the recovery of the value or amount of the
benefit received by a person when he is not lawfully entitled thereto; and
(f) any claim for the recovery of any benefit admissible under this Act.
(2A) If in any proceedings before the Employees' Insurance Court a disablement
question arises and the decision of a medical board or a medical appeal
tribunal has not been obtained on the same and the decision of such question
is necessary or the determination of the claim or question before the
Employees' Insurance Court, that Court shall direct the Corporation to have
the question decided by this Act and shall thereafter proceed wit the
determination of the claim or question before it is accordance with the
decision of the medical board or the medical appeal tribunal, as the case may
be, except where an appeal has been filed before the Employees' Insurance
Court under Sub-section (2) of Section 54A in which case the Employees'
Insurance Court may itself determine all the issue arising before it.
(2B) No matter which is in dispute between a principal employer and the
Corporation in respect of any contribution or any other dues shall be raised
by the principal employer in the Employees' Insurance Court unless he has
deposited with the Court fifty per cent. of the amount due from him as claimed
by the Corporation:
Provided that the Court may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, waive or
reduce the amount to be deposited under this sub-section.
(3) No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to decide or deal with any question
or dispute as aforesaid or to adjudicate on any liability which by or under
this Act is to be decided by a medical board, or by a medical appeal tribunal
or by the Employees' Insurance Court."
30\. The jurisdiction of the court, therefore, is a wide one and in terms
thereof even the question of applicability of the notification can be
questioned.
31\. The apex court in Employees' State Insurance Corporation v. F. Fibre
Bangalore (P) Ltd. , 1997 SCC (L&S) 190 categorically held:
"The full Bench of the High Court has held that in a case where the order
under Section 45-A becomes final , there is no need for the Corporation to
seek adjudication before the Insurance Court. In all other cases, the
Corporation is required to go to the Insurance Court, have it adjudicated and
then make a demand. We are of the view that the Full Bench of the High Court
is clearly in error to reach that conclusion. Though Section 75 of the Act
does not envisage as to who has to approach the Insurance Court, by necessary
implication when the employer denies the liability or applicability of the
provisions of the Act or the quantum of the contribution to be deposited by
the employer, it is for him to approach the Insurance Court and seek
adjudication. It is not for the Corporation in each case whenever there is a
dispute, to go to the Insurance Court and have the dispute adjudicated.
Otherwise, the Act would become unworkable and defeat the object and purpose
of the Act."
32\. The said decision has been considered by a Division Bench of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court, of which one of us was a member, in Ashok Leyland Ltd. v.
Tehsildar/Special Revenue Inspector (ESI) Recovery Cell and Ors. , 2002 (1)
ALT 262, wherein upon referring to the afore-mentioned decision of the Apex
Court in Employees' State Insurance Corporation v. F. Fibre Bangalore (P) Ltd.
(supra), it was held:
"5. Having regard to the aforementioned authoritative pronouncement of the
Apex Court, we are of the opinion that all questions, including the question
of applicability of the ESI Act to the petitioners, can be raised before the
Employees' Insurance Court. Therefore, the petitioners should avail the
remedies available to them."
"6. The above aspect of the matter was also considered by a Division Bench of
Patna High Court in Shriram bearings Ltd. v. E.S.I. Corporation (1977 Lab.
I.C. 1482 (Patna)(D.B.)), and N.P. Singh, J. as he then was, speaking for the
Bench categorically held that even the Courts and Tribunals constituted under
the ESI Act, have inherent power to issue appropriate relief by way of
injunction to the party before it and it can enforce the orders."
33\. For the reasons afore-mentioned, we are of the opinion that the writ
petition is not maintainable which is dismissed accordingly and the remedy for
the petitioner would be to file an appropriate application before the
Employees State Insurance Court, with costs. Advocate's fee is assessed at Rs.
5000/-.
Tehsildar/Special Revenue Inspector (ESI) Recovery Cell and Ors. , 2002 (1)
ALT 262, wherein upon referring to the afore-mentioned decision of the Apex
Court in Employees' State Insurance Corporation v. F. Fibre Bangalore (P) Ltd.
(supra), it was held:
"5. Having regard to the aforementioned authoritative pronouncement of the
Apex Court, we are of the opinion that all questions, including the question
of applicability of the ESI Act to the petitioners, can be raised before the
Employees' Insurance Court. Therefore, the petitioners should avail the
remedies available to them."
"6. The above aspect of the matter was also considered by a Division Bench of
Patna High Court in Shriram bearings Ltd. v. E.S.I. Corporation (1977 Lab.
I.C. 1482 (Patna)(D.B.)), and N.P. Singh, J. as he then was, speaking for the
Bench categorically held that even the Courts and Tribunals constituted under
the ESI Act, have inherent power to issue appropriate relief by way of
injunction to the party before it and it can enforce the orders."
33\. For the reasons afore-mentioned, we are of the opinion that the writ
4\. According to the petitioner, as neither at its registered office nor at
construction sites any manufacturing activity is carried out, it does not come
within the expression "factory" as occurring in Section 2(12) of the Act. It
allegedly has employed less than 20 persons in its office. It has been
contended that the office of the company is not a "shop" inasmuch as there
does not exist any go-down nor any stock is stored therein far less any sale
or purchase is carried on from the said premises nor any services there from
are rendered to any customer.
5\. Admittedly, at the relevant point of time, the petitioner had construction
sites at the following places:
1) Nehru Place,
2) Rajendra Place, and
3) Lodhi Road.
