    1.               By way of this supplementary charge-sheet, accused
    Abdul Karim @ Tunda @ Abdul Quddus, Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd.
    Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin are sought to be charged for having
    committed the offences punishable under Sections 121, 121A, and
    120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
criminal conspiracy are the disclosure statements of the four accused persons.
In the case of State vs. Navjot Sandhu reported in 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 16/17 reiterated that statements made by
conspirators after they are arrested cannot be brought within the ambit of
Section 10 of the Evidence Act as by that time the conspiracy would have
ended. Thus the said disclosure statements recorded after apprehension of the
accused persons cannot be relied upon to establish that the present four
accused persons were party to any criminal conspiracy. Even otherwise the said
disclosure statements are inadmissible. Hence there is no admissible material
brought by the prosecution to substantiate the charge of criminal conspiracy.
32\. For the reasons recorded above, the accused accused Abdul Karim @ Tunda @
Abdul Quddus, Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin are
discharged. All these four accused be released forthwith from judicial custody
unless required in any other case or proceedings.

     8.               Subsequently, by order dated 18.01.2006 of the same Ld.

    9.               As per the present supplementary police report under
    Section173 (2) of the Cr.P.C. qua the accused Abdul Karim @ Tunda @
    Abdul Quddus, Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin,
    it is stated that on 06.09.2013, Abdul Karim @ Tunda was arrested in
    the present case after he had given a detailed disclosure statement in
    FIR No. 46 of 1994, PS Malviya Nagar, Delhi. The allegations against
    Abdul Karim @ Tunda are that he was the mastermind of the blasts that
    had taken place in Delhi, Panipat, Rohtak, Sonipat, Ludhiana, Kanpur
    and Varanasi in 1997. Abdul Karim @ Tunda had disclosed that he had
    provided training to persons in handling bombs and that on his
    directions they had carried out the blasts in the year 1997. It is the case
    of the prosecution that the accused apprehended earlier and sent for
    trial had also given disclosure statements that Abdul Karim @ Tunda
    was the person who had instructed them.
    10.              During police custody, Abdul Karim @ Tunda disclosed
    that co-accused Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin
    had already been arrested. Upon inquiry, it came to light that Mohd.
    Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin had been apprehended in FIR No. 650
    of 2013, PS Raiganj, District Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal and were
    lodged in Cellular Jail, Islampur, West Bengal. Accused Mohd. Zakaria
    had been apprehended in FIR No. 93 of 2009, PS Sector P-3, West
    Bengal and was lodged in Presidency Jail. Upon applications being
    made, production warrants were issued qua these three accused
    persons.

    FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell                                    4/17
     11.              On 16.09.2013, Mohd. Zakaria was produced in Patiala
    House Courts and was arrested upon permission being granted by the
    Court. On 23.09.2013, accused Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin
    were produced in Patiala House Courts and were arrested. Upon
    interrogation, these three accused persons gave disclosure statements.
    12.              As per case set up in the police report, accused Mohd.
    Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin were in league with accused Abdul
    Karim @ Tunda and on his directions, the accused namely Mohd.
    Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin had helped terrorists
    cross India-Bangladesh border to carry out terrorist activities in the year
    1995-1996.
    13.              During the course of investigation, on 29.09.2013, the
    accused Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin were
    taken to West Bengal by the Investigating Officers. Accused Mohd.
    Zakaria led the police to Village Atrosia, PS Lal Gola, Mushirabad, West
    Bengal and pointed out that the place where he in the year 1996 on the
    directions of Abdul Karim @ Tunda and with the help of his co-accused
    Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin had helped Shakil and Amir
    Khan to illegally cross the border to go and meet Abdul Karim @ Tunda
    in Bangladesh and also to cross back in to India after they were trained
    in 1996. He also pointed out the place where with the help of his co-
    accused, he had enabled four terrorists Matiur Rehman, Akbar @
    Abdullah, Mohd. Shafikul Rehman and Abdul Karim to cross the India-
    Bangladesh border.

     14.              As per police report, accused Zakaria led the police team
    to Station near village Gobtola, Siropora, Thana Lal Gola, Mushirabad,
    West Bengal to Nazad Renu outpost BSF (also known as Furfuri
    border) and pointed out places from where in 1996, he on the directions
    of Abdul Karim @ Tunda and with the help of co-accused Mohd.
    Allauddin, Mohd. Basiruddin and Shafiq enabled three Pakistan
    terrorists Mohd. Hussain, Mohd. Azaz @ Abdullah and Maqsood Ahmad
    to illegally cross the India-Bangladesh border to get into India. He
    further pointed out the same place in 1994-95 from where he had
    helped Abdul Karim @ Tunda and his family to illegally cross the border.
    15.              Similarly accused Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin also
    pointed out the places from where they, on the directions of Abdul Karim
    @ Tunda, and with the help of their co-accused had enabled terrorists
    to cross the India-Bangladesh border.
    16.              Ld. Counsel for the accused persons had argued that the
    case set up qua Abdul Karim @ Tunda as well as other three accused
    persons was based on solely on their disclosure statements, disclosure
    statements of co-accused persons and pointing out memos in
    pursuance of their disclosure statements as well as disclosure
    statements of previously tried co-accused persons. They submitted that
    apart from the same, there was no other independent evidence on the
    basis of which the charges are sought to be proved against them.
    17.              It is not disputed by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State that the
    case against the present four accused persons is sought to be
    established on the basis of their disclosure statements and pointing out
    State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
    FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell                                       6/17
     memos and disclosure statements of previously tried co-accused
    persons.
    18.              In the case of Madhu v. State of Kerala, (2012) 2 SCC 399
    the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold as under:
               "47. The most significant issue in the present controversy is
               the veracity of the confessional statements made by the
               accused Madhu and Sibi before P.J. Thomas PW 21, Circle
               Inspector of Police on 13-5-1998. It is evident that the
               aforesaid statements were made by the accused before a
               police officer while the accused were in custody of the police.
               Section 25 of the Evidence Act postulates that a
               confession made by an accused to a police officer cannot
               be proved against him. Additionally, Section 26 of the
               Evidence Act stipulates that a confession made by an
               accused while in police custody cannot be proved against
               him. It is evident from the factual position narrated
               hereinabove, that the statements made by the accused Madhu
               and Sibi were made to a police officer while the accused were
               in police custody. It is, therefore, apparent that in terms of the
               mandate of Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act, the said
               statements could not be used against accused Madhu and
               Sibi. But then, there is an exception to the rule provided for by
               Sections 25 and 26 aforesaid, under Section 27 of the
               Evidence Act.
               48. Section 27 of the Evidence Act is being extracted
               hereunder:
               "27. How much of information received from accused may
               be proved.--Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as
               discovered in consequence of information received from a
               person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police
               officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a
               confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
               discovered, may be proved."
               As an exception, Section 27 of the Evidence Act provides
               that a confessional statement made to a police officer or
               while an accused is in police custody, can be proved
               against him, if the same leads to the discovery of an
    State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
    FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell                                     7/17
                unknown fact. The rationale of Sections 25 and 26 of the
               Evidence Act is, that police may procure a confession by
               coercion or threat. The exception postulated under Section 27
               of the Evidence Act is applicable only if the confessional
               statement leads to the discovery of some new fact. The
               relevance under the exception postulated by Section 27
               aforesaid, is limited "... as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
               discovered....". The rationale behind Section 27 of the
               Evidence Act is, that the facts in question would have
               remained unknown but for the disclosure of the same by
               the accused. The discovery of facts itself, therefore,
               substantiates the truth of the confessional statement. And
               since it is truth that a court must endeavour to search,
               Section 27 aforesaid has been incorporated as an
               exception to the mandate contained in Sections 25 and 26
               of the Evidence Act."
                                                          (emphasis supplied)
    19.              In the case of Mohtesham Mohd. Ismail v. Enforcement
    Directorate reported in (2007) 8 SCC 254 it was held as under:
            "19. Apart therefrom the High Court was bound to take into
            consideration the factum of retraction of the confession by the
            appellant. It is now a well-settled principle of law that a
            confession of a co-accused person cannot be treated as
            substantive evidence and can be pressed into service only
            when the court is inclined to accept other evidence and
            feels the necessity of seeking for an assurance in support of
            the conclusion deducible therefrom. (See Haricharan Kurmi v.
            State of Bihar, Haroom Haji Abdulla v. State of Maharashtra and
            Prakash Kumar v. State of Gujarat.)"
    20.              In the case of State of M.P. v. Mukesh reported in (2006)
    13 SCC 197 it was held as under:
            "20. The entire prosecution is based on the purported confession
            of Suresh Shah. A statement of an accused would be
            admissible against a co-accused only in terms of Section 30
    State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
    FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell                                     8/17
             of the Evidence Act. Such a statement of the co-accused
            was required to be corroborated by adduction of
            independent evidence. The prosecution has not adduced any
            independent evidence to show that the respondents had
intentionally aided the said Suresh Shah and thereby abetted him in commission
of an offence under Section 143(1) of the Railways Act."
21\. In the case of R. Janakiraman v. State reported in (2006) 1 SCC 697 it
was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:
> "25. The contention that a statement under Section 164 CrPC of an
> accomplice/co-accused cannot be used as evidence against an accused, on the
> facts of this case, is rather misleading. It is no doubt well settled that
> in dealing with a case against an accused person, the court cannot start
> with the confession of a co-accused and it must begin with other evidence
> adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard
> to the quality and effect of such evidence, it is permissible to turn to the
> confession in order to lend support or assurance to the conclusion of guilt
> which the court is about to reach on the other evidence, vide Hari Charan
> Kurmi v. State of Bihar and Dagdu v. State of Maharashtra. But in this case,
> the statements made by PW 11 and PW 15 before the Magistrate at Chennai are
> not the only evidence on which reliance is placed. It is used more as a
> corroboration. We may also note that PW 11 and PW 15 were not "co-accused"
> or "accomplices" or "abettors" of the appellant in regard to the charge of
> disproportionate assets. They came into the picture, only after the
> appellant's house was raided, in an effort by the appellant to explain the
> cash found to an extent of Rs 2,50,000."
22\. In the case of State of Maharashtra v. Kamal Ahmed Mohammed Vakil Ansari
reported in (2013) 12 SCC 17 the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold
that:
> "19. The issue in hand can also be examined from another perspective, though
> on the same reasoning. Ordinarily, as already noticed hereinabove, a
> confessional statement is State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
> FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 9/17 admissible only as against an
> accused who has made it. There is only one exception to the aforesaid rule,
> wherein it is permissible to use a confessional statement, even against
> person(s) other than the one who had made it. The aforesaid exception has
> been provided for in Section 30 of the Evidence Act, which is being
> extracted hereunder:
> "30. Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and
> others jointly under trial for same offence.-- When more persons than one
> are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one
> of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved,
> the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other
> person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
                * *         *
                Illustrations
> (a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said
> -- 'B and I murdered C'. The court may consider the effect of this
> confession as against B.
> (b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C
> was murdered by A and B, and that B said -- 'A and I murdered C'.
> This statement may not be taken into consideration by the court against A,
> as B is not being jointly tried". As is evident from a perusal of Section 30

> accused. For such admissibility it is imperative that the person making the
> confession besides implicating himself, also implicates others who are being
> jointly tried with him. In that situation alone, is such a confessional
> statement relevant even against the others implicated."
23\. In the case of Mohd. Khalid v. State of W.B. reported in (2002) 7 SCC 334
the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold that:
> "31. A confessional statement is not admissible unless it is made to the
> Magistrate under Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The requirement of Section
> 30 of the Evidence Act is that before it is made to operate against the co-
> accused the confession should be strictly State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda &
> Ors.
> FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 10/17 established. In other words, what
> must be before the court should be a confession proper and not a mere
> circumstance or an information which could be an incriminating one.
> Secondly, it being the confession of the maker, it is not to be treated as
> evidence within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act against the
> non- maker co-accused and lastly, its use depends on finding other evidence
> so as to connect the co-accused with the crime and that too as a
> corroborative piece. It is only when the other evidence tendered against the
> co-accused points to his guilt then the confession duly proved could be used
> against such co-accused if it appears to effect (sic) him as lending support
> or assurance to such other evidence. To attract the provisions of Section
> 30, it should for all purposes be a confession, that is a statement
> containing an admission of guilt and not merely a statement raising the
> inference with regard to such a guilt. The evidence of the co-accused cannot
> be considered under Section 30 of the Evidence Act, where he was not tried

But cases may arise where the Judge is not prepared to act on the other
evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it State vs. Abdul Karim &
Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 11/17 would be sufficient to sustain a
conviction. In such an event the Judge may call in aid the confession and use
it to lend assurance to the other evidence. This position has been clearly
explained by this Court in Kashmira Singh v. State of M.P. The exact scope of
Section 30 was discussed by the Privy Council in the case of Bhuboni Sahu v.
R. The relevant extract from the said decision which has become locus
classicus reads as follows: (AIR p. 260, para 9) Section 30 applies to
confessions, and not to statements which do not admit the guilt of the
confessing party. ... But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence
of a very weak type. ... It is a much weaker type of evidence than the
evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities.
Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into
consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may
act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof.
Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in
the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the
scale and weighed with the other evidence. The confession of a co-accused can
be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of
a conviction.
32\. Kashmira Singh principles were noted with approval by a Constitution
Bench of this Court in Haricharan Kurmi v. State of Bihar. It was noted that
the basis on which Section 30 operates is that if a person makes a confession
implicating himself, that may suggest that the maker of the confession is
speaking the truth. Normally, if a statement made by an accused person is
found to be voluntary and it amounts to a confession in the sense that it
implicates the maker, it is not likely that the maker would implicate himself
untruly. So Section 30 provides that such a confession may be taken into
consideration even against the co-accused who is being tried along with the
maker of the confession. It is significant, however, that like other evidence
which is produced before the court, it is not obligatory on the court to take
the confession into account. When evidence as defined by the Evidence Act is
produced before the court, it is the duty of the court to State vs. Abdul
Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 12/17 consider that evidence. What weight
should be attached to such evidence is a matter in the discretion of the
court. But the court cannot say in respect of such evidence that it will just
not take that evidence into account. Such an approach can, however, be adopted
by the court in dealing with a confession because Section 30 merely enables
the court to take the confession into account. Where, however, the court takes
it into confidence, it cannot be faulted. The principle is that the court
cannot start with confession of a co- accused person; it must begin with other
evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with
regard to the quality and effect of the said evidences, then it is permissible
to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of
guilt which the judicial mind is about to reach on some other evidence. That
is the true effect of the provision contained in Section 30. We may note that
great stress was laid down on the so-called retraction of the makers of the
confession. Apart from the fact that the same was made after about two years
of the confession, PWs 81 and 82 have stated in court as to the procedures
followed by them, while recording the confession. The evidence clearly
establishes that the confessions were true and voluntary. That was not the
result of any tutoring, compulsion or pressurization. As was observed by this
Court in Shankaria v. State of Rajasthan the court is to apply a double test
for deciding the acceptability of a confession i.e. (i) whether the confession
was perfectly voluntary, and (ii) if so, whether it is true and trustworthy.
Satisfaction of the first test is a sine qua non for its admissibility in
evidence. If the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any
inducement, threat or promise, such as mentioned in Section 24 of the Evidence
Act, it must be excluded and rejected brevi manu. If the first test is
satisfied, the court must before acting upon the confession reach the finding
that what is stated therein is true and reliable. The Judicial Magistrate, PWs
81 and 82 have followed the requisite procedure. It is relevant to further
note that complaint was lodged before the Magistrate before his recording of
the confessional statement of accused Md. Gulzar. The complaint was just filed
in court and it was not moved. The name of the lawyer filing the complaint
could not be ascertained either. This fact has been noted by the Designated
Court.
State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 13/17
33\. In view of what we have said about the confessional statement it is not
necessary to go into the question as to whether the statement recorded under
Section 164 of the Code has to be given greater credence even if the
confessional statement has not been recorded under Section 15 of the TADA Act.
However, we find substance in the stand of learned counsel for the accused-
appellants that Section 10 of the Evidence Act which is an exception to the
general rule while permitting the statement made by one conspirator to be
admissible as against another conspirator restricts it to the statement made
during the period when the agency subsisted. In State of Gujarat v. Mohd. Atik
it was held that the principle is no longer res integra that any statement
made by an accused after his arrest, whether as a confession or otherwise,
cannot fall within the ambit of Section 10 of the Evidence Act. Once the
common intention ceased to exist, any statement made by a former conspirator
thereafter cannot be regarded as one made in reference to their common
intention. In other words, the post-arrest statement made to a police officer,
whether it is a confession or otherwise touching his involvement in the
conspiracy, would not fall within the ambit of Section 10 of the Evidence
Act."
24\. Section 25 of the Evidence Act bars the admissibility of a confessional
statement made by an accused to a police official. Section 27 of the Evidence
Act lays down that a confessional statement made to a police official can be
proved against the accused if the same leads to the discovery of an unknown
fact. The same has been held to be so and reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the cases of Madhu v. State of Kerala (supra).
25\. The disclosure statements of the present four accused were made to police
officials and are thus inadmissible in evidence. No fact not known to the
police was discovered in pursuance of the said State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda &
Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 14/17 disclosure statements so as to
bring the same within the meaning of Section 27 of the Evidence Act.
26\. Section 30 read with illustration (b) of the Evidence Act provides that
the confession of a co-accused can be taken into consideration only if the
person making the confession and the co- accused are being jointly tried. In
the cases of State of Maharashtra v. Kamal Ahmed Mohammed Vakil Ansari and Md.
Khalid v. State of W.B. (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court held that evidence of a
co-accused cannot be considered under Section 30 of the Evidence Act when he
was not jointly tried with the accused.
27\. In the present case accused confessional statements of the previously
tried accused persons cannot be considered qua the present four accused as
they are not being jointly tried with them. Thus even if the confessional
statements of the previously tried accused persons were admissible, the same
cannot be considered qua the present four accused persons.
28\. In the cases of Mohtesham Mohd. Ismail v. Enforcement Directorate, State
of M.P. v. Mukesh and R. Janakiraman v. State (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme
Court was pleased to reiterate that a confession of a co-accused cannot be
treated as substantive evidence. While considering the case against an
accused, the Court cannot start with the confession of a co-accused and the
Court has to begin with the other evidence adduced by the prosecution. It is
only after the Court has formed an opinion regarding the quality and effect of
such evidence State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 15/17 that it is permissible to rely on
the confession of a co-accused to support the conclusion of guilt which the
Court may reach on the basis of other evidence. A statement of the co-accused
requires corroboration through independent evidence.
29\. Even if it could be argued that the statements of each accused could be
relied upon qua the other accused, the Court cannot start against each of them
on the basis of statements of co-accused persons. Admittedly there is no other
independent piece of evidence material relied upon by the prosecution which
could implicate the present four accused persons with the proposed charges.
30\. As far as the pointing out memos of Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and
Mohd. Basiruddin are concerned, they are in pursuance of the disclosure
statements of the said accused persons. There is no independent witness to
establish that these accused persons had helped terrorists to cross the Indo-
Bangladesh border. These pointing out memos would therefore be to no avail.
31\. As far as the charge of criminal conspiracy is concerned, Section 120B of
the IPC makes punishable an act of a person who is party to a criminal
conspiracy to commit an offence. Section 120A IPC defines 'criminal
conspiracy' to mean where two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done
an illegal act. In the present case the material relied upon for the charge of
criminal conspiracy are the disclosure statements of the four accused persons.
In the case of State vs. Navjot Sandhu reported in 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court State vs. Abdul Karim & Tunda & Ors.
FIR No. 49 of 1998, PS: Special Cell 16/17 reiterated that statements made by
conspirators after they are arrested cannot be brought within the ambit of
Section 10 of the Evidence Act as by that time the conspiracy would have
ended. Thus the said disclosure statements recorded after apprehension of the
accused persons cannot be relied upon to establish that the present four
accused persons were party to any criminal conspiracy. Even otherwise the said
disclosure statements are inadmissible. Hence there is no admissible material
brought by the prosecution to substantiate the charge of criminal conspiracy.
32\. For the reasons recorded above, the accused accused Abdul Karim @ Tunda @
Abdul Quddus, Mohd. Zakaria, Mohd. Allauddin and Mohd. Basiruddin are
discharged. All these four accused be released forthwith from judicial custody
unless required in any other case or proceedings.
