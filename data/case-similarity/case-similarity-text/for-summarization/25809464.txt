(48) Franchisor means any person who enters into franchise with a franchisee
and includes any associate of franchisor or a person designed by franchisor to
enter into franchise on this behalf and the terms franchisee shall be
construed accordingly. From the aforementioned definitions, it is crystal
clear that in the facts and circumstances, no services have been provided by
the appellant to FIPL under the classification of Franchise Service and IPR
service.
Although the said judgement clearly supports the case of the appellant, we
hesitate to drawn support there-from as we are unable to discern any guiding
analysis/principle/ratio therein. However, as our independent analysis in the
preceding paras unequivocally brings out, the agreements entered into by the
appellant with the manufacturers were not in the nature of franchise
agreements and the appellant did not provide franchise service to the
manufacturer.

    		Honble Mr. R.K. Singh, Member (Technical)
       		      F. Order No.52833-52834/2015
    Per R.K. Singh:
    	Appeal is filed against order in original dated 26/08/2010 in terms of which service tax demand of  Rs. 4,65,42,505/- was confirmed along with interest and penalties.
    2.	The facts of the case are as under
The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of branded alumina firebricks and
other refractory material. Besides manufacturing the said goods in its own
factory, the appellant, it is alleged, granted franchise for manufacture of
firebricks of specifications, design and quality prescribed by it to some
other small manufacturing units located at Katni. During the period of the
demand, as per the figure submitted by the appellant, it was seen that there
was a difference between the amount realised on account of sales of the
products to its customers and the purchase price actually paid by the
appellant to these manufacturing units which manufactured the goods. The
adjudicating authority held that this difference reflected the value of the
franchise service and confirmed the demand of Rs. 4,65,42,505/- under
franchise service along with interest and penalties.
3\. The appellant has contended that:
(a) The agreements with various manufacturing units to manufacture the said
products on its behalf as per the specifications, designs and quality as
directed by it were entered into several years before franchise service became
taxable and that while the word franchise or franchisee have been used in the
agreement, in substance it is not a franchise agreement and there was no
franchise fee prescribed therein,
(b) As per the agreement it gave orders for manufacture (and supply) of
firebricks to these manufacturing units which manufactured firebricks as per
the specification, design, quality directed by it and consigned them to its
customers as per its directions,
(c) The firebricks were manufactured as ordered by it and were consigned to
the customers as per its directions but those were solely purchased by it. The
manufacturers paid excise duty on the value at which it sold those bricks to
its customers. In the invoices issued by these manufacturers, it (appellant)
was shown as the buyer and the customers were shown as consignees.
(d) The manufacturers (so called franchisees) were not paying any
predetermined amount to the appellant as franchise fee and these so called
franchisees were nothing but mere manufacturers who were manufacturing goods
on its direction and the goods so manufactured were the property of the
appellant and were dispatched as per its direction and the so called
franchisees had no right over these goods.
(e) It did not provide any concept of business operations such as know-how,
method of operation, managerial expertise, marketing technique, standards of
quality control etc to these manufacturers.
(f) The appellant paid the manufacturers as per the agreed purchase
rates/terms and conditions of the purchase order and in its books of accounts
the amounts paid to these manufacturers is accounted as purchase cost of
products and the sale value based on the commercial bills raised on its
customers is recorded as value realised on sales. It was issuing sales tax
declaration forms for such purchases from these manufacturers and it was also
getting sales tax declaration forms from its customers.
(g) The realisation for sales were done by it directly from the customers. The
difference between the amount of excise invoice on which the taxes and duties
were paid and the purchase price paid to these manufacturer as per the
purchase order was termed as incremental/opportunity costs and it did not
represent any service charges and the prices mentioned in the manufacturers
invoices to it did not represent the sale price but the price only for the
purpose of calculating excise duty and sales tax. The manufacturers were only
paid the purchase rates as agreed upon.
(h) The sales tax was paid on the entire value and therefore service tax could
not be levied on the same amount as has been held by Supreme Court in the case
of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd Vs. Union of India - 2006 (2) ST STR 161 (SC), (I)
It did not grant to the manufacturers the right to use its brand-name and
these manufacturers were not free to sell the goods got manufactured by it to
anybody else except to the appellant and these manufacturers were not allowed
to consign these goods to any other person except to those they were directed
by it to consign them to.
(j) The manufacturers were selling the manufactured goods to the appellant for
which the manufacturers raised invoices on the appellant. In the said
invoices, the appellant was shown as buyer and the customer of the appellant
whom the goods were ultimately sold by it was shown as consignee. Thus it was
sale of the goods by the manufacturers to the appellant for which payment of
sale proceed was made by the appellant to the manufacturers. The appellant
thereafter raised sale bills on its buyer-customers to whom the goods were
consigned and it received payment directly from the customers. In these
transactions, there was neither any payment on account of any franchise fees
nor of any commission. Whenever manufacturers cleared the goods consigned to
its customers, they customers, it paid excise duty on full value of the goods
which included the trading profit of the appellant. Once excise duty was paid
on this amount, no service tax could be levied on the same amount.
(k) The difference between the amount charged by the manufacturers from the
appellant in respect of the goods manufactured by them and the value at which
the goods are finally sold by the appellant to its customers was nothing but
trading profit of the appellant and does not represent franchise fee.
(l) All the manufacturers have denied the existence of any franchise
relationship between them and the appellant.
(m) The demand is time-barred in as much as the 1st interaction in this regard
with Revenue took place in 2005 and thus the nature of transactions was in the
knowledge of Revenue at least from 2005 onwards and there was no wilful
misstatement/suppression on its part. It cited some familiar judgements with
regard to invokability of extended period.
(n) Part of the demand is time-barred even on the criteria of (extended) five-
year period.
(o) Even if the demand is held to be sustainable, the cum-tax benefit needs to
be extended.
(p) The judgement of Skol Breweries Ltd. Vs. CCE, Aurangabad 
2014-TIOL-588-CESTAT-Mumbai has decided the issue in its favour.
4\. The ld. DR supported the reasoning of the adjudicating authority and added
that even the agreement with the manufacturers mentions the words
franchise/franchisee. He cited the CESTAT judgement of Delhi Public School
Society Vs. CST, Delhi  2013 (32) STR 179 (Tri.-Del.).
5\. We have considered the contentions of both sides. The only issue in this
case is whether the service, if any, rendered by the appellant to the
manufacturers fell under the scope of franchise service. Therefore, it is
useful to re-produce the definition of franchisor given in Section 65(48) of
the Finance Act, 1994 and franchise defined in Section 65(47) of Finance Act,
1994 as under:
Franchisor means any person who enters into franchise with a franchisee and
includes any associate of franchisor or a person designed by franchisor to
enter into franchise on this behalf and the terms franchisee shall be
construed accordingly. Franchise means an agreement by which
(i) Franchisee is granted representational right to sell or manufacture good
or to provide service or undertake any process identified with franchisor,
whether or not a trademark, service mark, trade name or logo or any such of
symbol, as the case may be, is involved.
(ii) The franchisor provide concept of business operation to franchisee,
including know-how, method of operation, managerial expertise, marketing
technique or training and standards of quality control except passing on the
ownership of all know-how to franchisee;
(iii) The franchisee is required to pay to the franchisor, directly to
indirectly, a fee; and
(iv) The franchisee is under an obligation not to engage in selling or
providing similar goods or services kor process, identified with any other
person. The finance Act 2005 has substituted the following definition for
expression franchise w.e.f. 16.6.2005.
Franchise means an agreement by which franchisee is granted representational
right to sell for manufacture, good or to provide service or undertake any
process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trademark, service mark,
trade name or logo or any such of symbol, as the case may be, is involved. A
careful perusal of the aforesaid definitions makes it clear that one of the
non-derogable conditions to cover any agreement under the scope of franchise
is that the franchisee is granted representational right to sell or
manufacture goods identified with franchisor.
6\. We have perused the representative agreement under which the appellant got
the goods manufactured from various manufacturers. The said agreement is
reproduced below for the sake of comprehensiveness of the order :
THIS AGREEMENT is entered into between M/s. Associated Cement Companies
Limited, Bombay a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act having
its head office at 121 Maharshi Carve Road, Cement House, Bombay and unit
called Katni Refractory Works at Katni (M.P.) hereinafter called Party No.1

binding on party no.2 IN WITness hereof, the parties above mentioned have
executed and signed this agreement on this 25th day of August, 1994 at Katni
before the witnesses:
All disputes shall be subject to Jabalpur jurisdiction.
7\. At this juncture as the issue involved is interpretation of
agreement/contract it is useful to partially quote para 16 & 17 from the
CESTAT judgement in the case of Delhi Public School Society (supra) which
elucidate the general principles of interpretation/construction of documents.
16.?Before we part with the aspect relating to interpretation of the
agreements between the assessee and the other parties, for establishing
schools under the brand name, motto and logo of the assessee, a brief analysis
of the general principles of interpretation/construction of documents is
appropriate.
(a) In Radha Sundar Dutta v. Mohd. Jahadur Rahim \- AIR 1959 SC 24; Puzhakkal
Kuttappu v. C. Bhargavi and Others \- (1977) 1 SCC 17; Ford against Beech -
(1848) 11 QB 852; Inntrepreneur Pub Co. Ltd. v. East Crown Ltd. - (2000) 2
Lloyds Rep 611; Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v. West Bromwich Building
Society - (1998) 1 ALL ER 98 and Hideo Yoshimoto v. Canterbury Golf
International Limited - 2000 NZCA 350 the general principles pertaining to
construction of documents/contracts were delineated :
Lord Hoffmann in the leading opinion of the House of Lords (with which the
other learned law Lords concurred) in West Bromwich Building Society, while
observing that almost all the old intellectual baggage of legal
interpretation was discarded, summarized the principles by which contractual
documents are presently considered, as under :
(i) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document
would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which
would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which
they were at the time of the contract.
(ii) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the
matrix of fact, but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description
of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should
have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be
mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the
way in which the language of the documents would have been understood by a
reasonable man.
(iii) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous
negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They
are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this
distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal
interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary
life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this
is not the occasion on which to explore them.
(iv) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a
reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning
of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document
is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would
reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable
the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are
ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that
the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the word, words or syntax
[Mannai Investment Co. Ltd. v. Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd. - (1997) ALL
ER 352].
(v) The rule that words should be given their natural and ordinary meaning
reflects the commonsense proposition that we do not easily accept that people
have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other
hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something
must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to
attribute to the parties An intention which they plainly could not have had.
Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he said in Antaios Cia
Naviera SA v. Salen Rederierna AB, The Antaios - (1984) 3 ALL ER 229 at 233,
(1985) AC 191 at 201.
... If detailed semantic and syntactical analyses of words in a commercial
contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common sense,
it must be made to yield to business common sense.
17.?In Hideo Yoshimoto, Thomas, J. for the New Zealand Court of Appeal after
quoting with approval the restatement of law by Lord Hoffmann in West Bromwich
Building Society and noting that the five principles Lord Hoffmann articulated
were reiterated and applied by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Boat Park
Ltd. v. Hutchison, referred to a paradigm shift in the interpretative
principles noticed by Wigmore [Wigmore on Evidence - 1981-vol. 9, para 2461]
and agreed with the observation : The history of the law of interpretation is
the history of a progress from a stiff and superstitious formalism to a
flexible rationalism; and proceeded to state : The cardinal rule of
contractual interpretation must be to ascertain the intention of the parties.
To the extent this rule is not implemented, the courts must incur the
criticism of failing to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the
parties. Surely the parties are reasonably entitled to expect that the courts
will strive to ascertain their true intention or, certainly, not to arrive at
a meaning of their contract which is at variance with their actual intention.
They cannot expect that the judicial exercise of constructing their contract
will be buried under a stockpile of excessive formalism.
Lewison [Kim Levison - The Interpretation of Contracts, Sweet and Maxwell,
(1989)] refers to a lucid summary of the relevant principles set out in the
judgment of Saville, J. in Vitol B.V. v. Compagnie Europeene des Petroles -
(1988) 1 Lloyds Rep 574. The approach of the English law to questions of the
true construction of contracts of this kind is to seek objectively to
ascertain the intentions of the parties from the words which they have chosen
to use. xxxxxx
8\. It is evident from the agreement reproduced earlier that :
(i) The manufacturers did not have any right to manufacture the goods
identified with the appellant except in compliance of the purchase orders of
the appellant,
(ii) They also did not have any right to sell those goods to any person except
the appellant or even consign those goods to any person except the customers
of the appellant and in accordance with the directions of the appellant.
(iii) No payment from the consignees came to the manufacturers. The payment by
the consignees was made to the appellant.
(iv) The manufacturers did not pay any amount to the appellant; on the other
hand, it was the appellant which paid to the manufacturers for manufacturing
those goods as per its purchase orders.
It thus comes out loud and clear that the manufacturers did not have any
representational right to manufacture goods identified with the appellant.
Indeed the appellant did not provide any service to these manufacturers nor
did the manufacturers make any payment to the appellant for any service. The
flow of payment was from the appellant to the manufacturer which would not
have been the case had the appellant provided any service to the
manufacturers. Merely because the words franchise and franchisee have been
used in the agreement between the appellant and the manufacturers does not
ipso facto mean that as per that agreement franchise service was rendered. As
elucidated in para 7 above, whether franchise service has been rendered as per
the said agreement has to be ascertained from the actual context, intent and
content of the agreement. As has been analysed, no part of the agreement gives
the slightest support to the contention that it gave representational right to
the manufacturers to manufacture goods identified with the appellant. As a
consequence notwithstanding the presence of words, franchise/franchisee,
therein, the said agreement miserably fails to qualify as franchise agreement.
The judgement of CESTAT in the case of Delhi Public School Society Vs. CST,
New Delhi  2013 (32) STR 179 (Tri.-Del.) is not relevant to the present
circumstances. In that case the franchisee had representational right to
render service identified with Delhi Public School Society and also that
judgement dealt with totally different facts and circumstances.
9\. We have seen some of the invoices issued by the appellant as well as the
manufacturers. We find that the manufacturers have issued invoices where the
goods were shown to be sold to the appellant and the consignee is the person
to whom the goods were consigned as per the direction of the appellant. The
appellant in turn sent the invoice to the consignee- customer in which the
total value shown was the aggregate of the value of the goods plus various
taxes shown in the invoice of the manufacturer raised on the appellant. From
this it is evident that as far as the manufacturer is concerned the goods were
sold to the appellant and were consigned only to those persons whom the
appellant directed the manufacturer to consign them to. The manufacturer did
not have any right to sell these goods directly to any customer in the market.
The goods were manufactured and consigned by these manufacturers as per the
purchase orders placed by the appellant in which it indicated the name of the
consignee but there was no direct contact between the manufacturers and the
consignee either with regard to placing of orders or with regard to payment
for the goods. The payment for the goods by the consignee- customers was made
to the appellant and appellant, in effect, paid to the manufacturers the
amount agreed upon for manufacturing those goods. It was only a financial
mechanism that because the manufacturers invoices raised on the appellant
showed the value of the goods at which the appellant sold the goods to the
customers so as to pay due excise duty and sales tax thereon but as the
manufacturer was entitled to receive only the amount agreed upon between the
appellant and the manufacturer for manufacture of goods the manufacturer also
issued a credit note of an amount which represented the difference between the
value of the invoice and the amount which the manufacturer was entitled to
receive for manufacturing those goods as a result of which the appellant was
enabled to pay to the manufacturer only that amount which was agreed upon
between the appellant and the manufacturer for manufacture of those goods
while the transactions as per invoices also got squared off. Thus, the actual
transactions are also in conformity with the agreement and clearly support the
analysis/inference in the preceding para.
10\. We find that CESTAT in the case of M/s Skol Breweries Ltd. (supra)
involving similar circumstances has held as under :
8. Having considered the rival submissions, we find that as per the agreement
between the parties, the risk of manufacture and sale lies with the appellant
in respect of the Foster Brand beer got manufactured by it from FIPL. It is
evident from the contract that FIPL is only responsible for bottling, packing
and dispatch as per the specification, terms, formula etc. as laid down by the
appellant. Further FIPL is bound to charge the price from the notified Identer
of the appellant as fixed by the appellant. Only for the risks associated with
the manufacturing process fastened on FIPL (CBU), it cannot be said that as
FIPL is responsible for proper quality, quantity and timely production, they
are providing Franchise Service and/or IPR Service. Further taking notice of
the definitions which are reproduced below:-
47. Franchise means an agreement by which Franchisee is granted
representational right to sell or manufacture good or to provide service or
undertake any process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trademark,
service mark, trade name or logo or any such of symbol, as the case may be, is
involved.
(48) Franchisor means any person who enters into franchise with a franchisee
and includes any associate of franchisor or a person designed by franchisor to
enter into franchise on this behalf and the terms franchisee shall be
construed accordingly. From the aforementioned definitions, it is crystal
clear that in the facts and circumstances, no services have been provided by
the appellant to FIPL under the classification of Franchise Service and IPR
service.
Although the said judgement clearly supports the case of the appellant, we
hesitate to drawn support there-from as we are unable to discern any guiding
analysis/principle/ratio therein. However, as our independent analysis in the
preceding paras unequivocally brings out, the agreements entered into by the
appellant with the manufacturers were not in the nature of franchise
agreements and the appellant did not provide franchise service to the
manufacturer.
11\. In the light of the analysis above, we declare that the appellant did not
provide franchise service and the impugned demand is not sustainable.
Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order in original and allow the appeal.

    2.	The facts of the case are as under
The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of branded alumina firebricks and
other refractory material. Besides manufacturing the said goods in its own
factory, the appellant, it is alleged, granted franchise for manufacture of
firebricks of specifications, design and quality prescribed by it to some
other small manufacturing units located at Katni. During the period of the
demand, as per the figure submitted by the appellant, it was seen that there
service mark, trade name or logo or any such of symbol, as the case may be, is
involved.
(48) Franchisor means any person who enters into franchise with a franchisee
and includes any associate of franchisor or a person designed by franchisor to

       		      F. Order No.52833-52834/2015
    Per R.K. Singh:
    	Appeal is filed against order in original dated 26/08/2010 in terms of which service tax demand of  Rs. 4,65,42,505/- was confirmed along with interest and penalties.
    2.	The facts of the case are as under
The appellant is engaged in the manufacture of branded alumina firebricks and
other refractory material. Besides manufacturing the said goods in its own
factory, the appellant, it is alleged, granted franchise for manufacture of
firebricks of specifications, design and quality prescribed by it to some
other small manufacturing units located at Katni. During the period of the
demand, as per the figure submitted by the appellant, it was seen that there
service mark, trade name or logo or any such of symbol, as the case may be, is
involved.
(48) Franchisor means any person who enters into franchise with a franchisee
and includes any associate of franchisor or a person designed by franchisor to
enter into franchise on this behalf and the terms franchisee shall be
construed accordingly. From the aforementioned definitions, it is crystal
clear that in the facts and circumstances, no services have been provided by
the appellant to FIPL under the classification of Franchise Service and IPR
service.
Although the said judgement clearly supports the case of the appellant, we
hesitate to drawn support there-from as we are unable to discern any guiding
analysis/principle/ratio therein. However, as our independent analysis in the
preceding paras unequivocally brings out, the agreements entered into by the
appellant with the manufacturers were not in the nature of franchise
agreements and the appellant did not provide franchise service to the
manufacturer.

    		Honble Mr. R.K. Singh, Member (Technical)
       		      F. Order No.52833-52834/2015
    Per R.K. Singh:
    	Appeal is filed against order in original dated 26/08/2010 in terms of which service tax demand of  Rs. 4,65,42,505/- was confirmed along with interest and penalties.

factory, the appellant, it is alleged, granted franchise for manufacture of
firebricks of specifications, design and quality prescribed by it to some
other small manufacturing units located at Katni. During the period of the
demand, as per the figure submitted by the appellant, it was seen that there
was a difference between the amount realised on account of sales of the
products to its customers and the purchase price actually paid by the
appellant to these manufacturing units which manufactured the goods. The
adjudicating authority held that this difference reflected the value of the
franchise service and confirmed the demand of Rs. 4,65,42,505/- under
franchise service along with interest and penalties.
3\. The appellant has contended that:
(a) The agreements with various manufacturing units to manufacture the said
products on its behalf as per the specifications, designs and quality as
directed by it were entered into several years before franchise service became
taxable and that while the word franchise or franchisee have been used in the
service mark, trade name or logo or any such of symbol, as the case may be, is
involved.
