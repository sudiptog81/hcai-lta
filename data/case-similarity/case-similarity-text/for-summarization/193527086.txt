    Dr.S.Muralidhar, J.
1\. These two appeals arise out of a common set of facts, involve the same
Appellant and give rise to the same questions of law and are accordingly being
disposed of by this common judgment.
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 1 of 20
RFA (OS) (COMM) 1/2019
2\. This appeal is directed against an order dated 12th November, 2018 passed
by the learned Single Judge in CS(COMM) No. 980/2016 and IA No. 24186/2014.
3\. The said suit was filed by the Respondent (Plaintiff) (L‟OREAL) against
M/s Brandworld (Defendant No.1) and the present Appellant (Defendant No.2).
The suit was for permanent injunction to restrain the Defendants from using
manufacturing, marketing, stopping, selling, displaying, advertising through
internet on the online market place through the website of the present
Appellant i.e. www.Shopclues.com, using the Plaintiff‟s trademark L‟OREAL with
or without the word Paris or any other word/mark which will be identical with
or deceptively similar to the Plaintiff‟s said trademark L‟OREAL in relation
to their impugned use of business and cosmetics and other related/light
products or from doing any act amounting to infringement of the Plaintiff‟s
registered trademark, passing off or violation of the Plaintiff‟s rights in
the said trademark violating its proprietary rights and infringing its
copyright in the L‟OREAL label.
4\. When the suit was first listed for hearing on 14th October, 2014 an ex
parte injunction was passed in I.A. No. favour of the Plaintiff under O 39
Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (CPC). Thereafter, the
present Appellant filed an application being IA 10325 of 2015 under Order
XXXIX Rule 4 seeking vacation of the interim order. It was dismissed by the
learned Single Judge on 18th May 2015 observing as under:
> "In the opinion of this Court, it cannot be a matter of chance that so
> RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 2 of 20 many counterfeit products are
> being sold on the applicant/defendants website. Consequently, this Court is
> of the view that no grant for vacation of stay has been made out. "
5\. Thereafter, an application was filed by the Appellant under Order XIII-A
CPC which was dismissed as withdrawn on 23rd February, 2017 with liberty to
file a fresh application. However, on 11th May, 2017 the Court noted that the
present Appellant decided not to file a fresh application under Order XIII-A
CPC.
6\. Admission/denial of documents was thereafter carried out. The suit was
listed before the learned Single Judge dated 24th July, 2018 for case
management. On that date, none appeared for Defendant No.1. The learned Single
Judge noted that submissions were addressed on 24 th July, 2018 on behalf of
the Plaintiff and the present Appellant and both counsel have "no objection if
the suit is disposed of finally". Thereafter orders were reserved and the
impugned judgment was passed on 12 th November, 2018 decreeing the suit
against the present Appellant.
7\. The learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment came to the following
conclusions:
> "a) Shopclues.com is directed with immediate effect, to disclose the
> complete details of all its sellers, their addresses and contact details on
> its website;
> b) Shopclues.com is directed to obtain a certificate from its sellers that
> the goods are genuine;
> a) Prior to uploading a product bearing the Plaintiffs marks, it shall
> RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 3 of 20 notify the plaintiff and obtain
> concurrence before offering the said products for sale on its platform;
> b) Shopclues.com enter shall into a proper agreement with its various
> sellers, under which it shall obtain guarantee as to authenticity and
> genuinity of the products as also provide for consequences of violation of
> the same.
> c) Upon being notified by the Plaintiff of any counterfeit product being
> sold on its platform, it shall notify the seller and if the seller is unable
> to provide evidence that the product is genuine, it shall take down the
> listing and notify the plaintiff of the same, as per the Intermediary
> Guidelines, 2011;
> d) It shall also seek a guarantee from the sellers that the product has not
> been impaired in any manner and that all warranties and guarantees of the
> Plaintiff are applicable and shall be honoured by the seller. Products of
> any sellers who are unable to provide such a guarantee shall not be offered
> on the Defendant's platform;
> e) The replica window appearing on the website is directed to be taken down
> within one week."
8\. The present appeal RFA (OS) (COMM) 1 of 2019 came up for hearing on 14th
January, 2019 on which date the Plaintiff Respondent appeared on advance
notice. By the order dated 14th January, 2019 this Court directed as under:
i) the ex parte order passed on 14th October, 2014 by the learned Single Judge
would continue to operate till the next date.
ii) With regard to the direction in para 20 (b) of the impugned judgment the
Appellant while entering into any fresh agreement, would obtain certificate
from merchants/sellers that the goods are genuine. This would be in addition
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 4 of 20 to the MoU.
iii) the Court took on record the statement of the Appellant that a) they had
already removed and deleted the representation "guarantee that all products
are 100% genuine" and b) that „replica‟ were not counterfeit products but were
replicas of „non-protected items.‟ It is noted that the Appellant has,
however, removed the category of „replicas‟ from their website.
iv) it was directed that the Appellant would not on the website guarantee or
state that all products are 100% genuine. It was also directed that the
Appellant shall remove and not display/sell any products which are termed as
„replica‟.
9\. It was further directed that the impugned judgment of the learned Single
Judge would not be a final and binding precedent in other cases on the
question whether the Appellant was an intermediary or not. That issue could be
examined by any forum or Court, including District Courts, on the basis of
evidence and materials in a given case.
10\. This Court further clarified in the order dated 14th January, 2019:
> "This order would not be treated as expressing any final or binding opinion
> as, at this stage, we have only balanced the rights of the parties to ensure
> that the status quo as was prevailing before the impugned judgment was
> passed, is maintained."
RFA (OS) (COMM) 5/2019
11\. RFA (OS) (COMM) 5/2019 challenges the final judgment dated 12th
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 5 of 20 November, 2018 passed by the
learned Single Judge in CS (COMM) 979/2016 and IA No.24578/2014 decreeing the
suit filed by the Respondent/Plaintiff against the present Appellant (arrayed
as DefendantNo.3). Earlier, the suit was decreed against the remaining
Defendants in the suit i.e. M/s Shree Shyam Telecom and M/s Kart Value
(Defendant Nos.1 and 2 respectively).
12\. The suit was for a decree of permanent injunction restraining all the
Defendants collectively "from manufacturing, marketing, purveying, supplying,
using, selling, soliciting, exporting, displaying, advertising on the online
market place or by any other mode or manner dealing in or using the
Plaintiff‟s trademark „SKULLCANDY‟ or any other word/mark which will be
identical with or deceptively similar thereto on the website of the present
Appellant (Defendant No.3) i.e. www.ShopClues.com or any other website in
relation to the business of readymade garments, apparel and related/light
products and from doing any other acts amounting to or likely to infringe the
Plaintiff‟s aforementioned trademark copyright and proprietor right in the
said label." In other words, there was no specific relief claimed against the
present Appellant which was different from the relief claimed in respect of
the other Defendants.
13\. The case of the Plaintiff (Respondent herein) was that they were engaged
in the manufacture, distribution and sale of various devices/accessories for
use with mobile phones. The Plaintiff claimed that the mark of "SKULLCANDY"
was registered in its favour in India in Class 9 and 25. It was also
represented in a unique logo form which was an original artistic RFA(OS)(COMM)
1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 6 of 20 work protected under the copyright laws.
According to the Plaintiff, it came to know that Defendant Nos.1 and 2 i.e.
Shree Shyam Telecom and M/s Kart Value were selling products, of the
Plaintiff‟s origin, which were of inferior quality and thus counterfeit, and
also offering massive discounts, on the aforementioned website
www.ShopClues.com owned by the present Appellant (Defendant No.3) which was an
interactive online market place.
14\. In the said suit on 8th December, 2014 an ex parte injunction was granted
by the learned Single Judge restraining the Defendants inter-alia from selling
and advertising on the website www.ShopClues.com using the aforementioned
trademarks "SKULLCANDY" or its device or any other word/mark identical or
deceptively similar thereto.
15\. It is recorded in the impugned order that thereafter Defendant Nos.1 and
2 settled the matter with the Plaintiff and an application under Order XXIII
Rule 3 CPC was filed. The suit was decreed against the said Defendant Nos.1
and 2 as settled in terms of paras 36 (a) (i) to 36 (a) (iii) of the plaint.
The suit remained pending in respect of the present Appellant.
16\. The present Appellant filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC as
well as an application under Order XIII-A for a summary judgment. All
applications were dismissed by the learned Single Judge on 23rd February,
2017\. After admission/denial of documents was completed, the suit was listed
before the learned Single Judge on 24th July, 2018 for case management.
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 7 of 20
17\. In para 6 of the impugned order, it is recorded that submissions were
addressed on behalf of both the parties "and both counsels have no objection
if the suit is disposed of finally". The learned Single Judge reserved orders
on 24th July, 2018. In the impugned judgement delivered on 12th November, 2018
the learned Single Judge held as under:
i) As per the policy of the Appellant on protection of intellectual property
in Court, any person who believes that its IPR rights are being violated could
sent can send a notice of infringement form, specifying the infringing
listings. On being satisfied of the veracity and genuineness of the said
notice, the Appellant immediately directs de-listing of the product. This is
called as the PIP programme.
ii) There is a separate category for „replicas‟ being sold on the website of
the Appellant. While the PIP programme appeared to be effective, "the display
of a replica window is definitely not condonable."
iii) Quoting extensively from the decision of the learned Single Judge dated
2nd November, 2018 in CS (COMM) 344/2018 Christian Louboutin SAS vs. Nakul
Bajaj & Ors., the learned Single Judge noted that the question whether an
online market place is an intermediary was dependent on a number of factors.
The learned Single Judge in para 21 of the impugned order gave five instances
on the basis of which the website of the present Appellant would be
disqualified for exemption under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act,
2000 („IT Act‟) since the role of its website was "more than that of an
intermediary".
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 8 of 20
18\. Accordingly, the learned Single Judge proceeded to decree the suit
issuing the following directions:
> "a) Shopclues.com is directed with immediate effect, to disclose the
> complete details of all its sellers, their addresses and contact details on
> its website;
> b) Shopclues.com is directed to obtain a certificate from its sellers that
> the goods are genuine;
> a) Prior to uploading a product bearing the Plaintiffs marks, it shall
> notify the plaintiff and obtain concurrence before offering the said
> products for sale on its platform;
> b) Shopclues.com enter shall into a proper agreement with its various
> sellers, under which it shall obtain guarantee as to authenticity and
> genuinity of the products as also provide for consequences of violation of
> the same;.
> c) Upon being notified by the Plaintiff of any counterfeit product being
> sold on its platform, it shall notify the seller and if the seller is unable
> to provide evidence that the product is genuine, it shall take down the
> listing and notify the plaintiff of the same, as per the Intermediary
> Guidelines, 2011;
> d) It shall also seek a guarantee from the sellers that the product has not
> been impaired in any manner and that all warranties and guarantees of the
> Plaintiff are applicable and shall be honoured by the seller. Products of
> any sellers who are unable to provide such a guarantee shall not be offered
> on the Defendant's platform;
> e) The replica window appearing on the website is directed to be taken down
> within one week."
19\. When this appeal was first listed for hearing the Court was informed of
the order passed by it in RFA (OS) (COMM) 1/2019 on 14th January, 2019 which
was directed against a similar order dated 12th November, 2018 in
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 9 of 20 another suit CS (OS) No. 980/2016
filed by M/s L‟OREAL against the present Appellant. The Court then directed in
para 6 of the order as under:
> "6. We direct that the ex-parte order passed on 14th October, 2014 by the
> learned Single Judge would continue to operate till the next date of
> hearing."
Questions of law
20\. Admit. The following questions of law arise for consideration in both the
appeals from the impugned judgments of the learned Single Judge.
(i) Whether the learned Single Judge could have, merely on the basis that
counsel for both parties agreed to the „final disposal of the suit‟, dispensed
with the further stages of framing of issues and recording of evidence as
mandated by the CPC as further modified by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015
(CCA)?
ii) Were the findings and directions issued in respect of the Appellant beyond
the scope of the suits themselves inasmuch as they granted reliefs not sought
for by the Plaintiff itself in the suits?
Submissions of counsel for the Appellant
21\. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel appearing for the
Appellant/Defendant at the outset pointed out that what was listed before the
Court on 28th July, 2018 were the suits for the purposes of „case management‟.
The applications for interim injunction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC
filed by the Plaintiff were also pending and listed before the learned Single
Judge along with the suits. He submitted that the mere RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 &
5/2019 Page 10 of 20 fact that both counsel for the Plaintiff in each suit and
the present Appellant submitted that they had no objection if the "suit is
disposed of finally", did not mean that they had conceded to the procedure
outlined in the CPC and CCA being dispensed with. In other words, there was no
consent by the Appellant to dispense with the framing of issues arising from
the pleadings specifying the reliefs being sought against the present
Appellant by the Plaintiff. It also did not mean that recording of evidence
and a full-fledged trial could be dispensed with. Mr. Sethi submitted that the
question of the Appellant conceding to findings being rendered against it
without any evidence being led in that behalf by the Plaintiff and without the
Appellant having an opportunity to counter such evidence did not arise. He
accordingly submitted that the procedure adopted by the learned Single Judge
was unknown to law and on this short ground, the impugned judgment ought to be
set aside in each of the cases.
22\. Mr. Sethi also submitted that while the Appellant would have no objection
to any injunction that restrains the selling of products that might be viewed
as infringing the intellectual property rights of the Plaintiff in each of the
cases, there could not be an omnibus finding by the learned Single Judge
against the Appellant that it is not merely an intermediary but something
beyond it and therefore it was not entitled to the protection under Section 79
of the IT Act.
23\. The further findings against the Appellant that there are several
infringement actions against it and that its website did not seem to be taking
precautions to stop sale of counterfeits and its „replica‟ window encourages
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 11 of 20 sellers to post lookalike products
as a feature of the replica window "would constitute aiding and abetment of
violation of intellectual property" were all without the Appellant having an
opportunity to not only challenge such evidence but also lead its own evidence
in defence. Accordingly, the findings against the Appellant were unsustainable
in law. Inasmuch as the impugned judgment was the final judgment in decree and
suit these findings were prejudicial to the Appellant and would constitute a
precedent in other cases negating its defence that it is an intermediary
entitled to the protection under Section 79 of the IT Act.
24\. In this context Mr. Sethi submitted that the impugned judgment was
contrary to several decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court including
the order dated 3rd April, 2013 in CA No. 5168/2000 [Sanchayani Savings
Investment (Investment) Ltd. v. State of West Bengal], judgment dated 23rd
December, 2016 in FAO (OS) No. 540/2011 [Myspace Inc. v. Super Cassettes
Industries Ltd.], order dated 9th July, 2014 in CS(OS) No. 1402/2014
[Bayrische Motoren Werk G (BMW Group) v. Jagdishlal Batra], the order of the
learned Single Judge dated 18 th January, 2017 in CS (COMM) No. 1655/2016
[Kent RO Systems Ltd. v. Amit Kotak] which was further affirmed with some
modification by an order dated 1 st May, 2017 of the Division Bench in FAO(OS)
(COMM) No. 95/2017 [Kent RO Systems Pvt. Ltd. v. E-bay India Private Limited],
order dated 4th November, 2016 in SC No. 485/2016 [H.D.Lee Company v. Manish
Kumar] order dated 3rd September, 2015 of the Bombay High Court in Suit No.
1014/2015 [Siddhi Vinayak Knots and Prints Pvt. Ltd. v. Crafts Villa].
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 12 of 20
25\. Mr. Sethi further submitted that the directions issued in para 20 of the
impugned judgment to the present Appellant were far beyond what has been
claimed by the Plaintiff in each of the suits. They were also incapable of
being complied with by the Appellant. No such directions could have been
issued beyond the pleadings and reliefs claimed in the suit without the
Appellant having been issued notice on the relevant issues and in particular
without issues even being framed in that regard.
Submissions of counsel for the Respondent
26\. Mr. Rishi Bansal, learned counsel for the Respondent in both appeals, on
the other hand referred to the provisions of Section 79 of the IT Act and
submitted that the Appellant would not be entitled to the benefit of that
provision as an intermediary if it had "conspired or abetted or aided or
induced" in the commission of an unlawful act. However, he was unable to
persuade the Court that the impugned findings and directions against the
Appellant in the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge could have been
passed without issues being framed and without a full-fledged trial.
27\. Mr. Bansal sought to contend that dispensing with the above two stages
was perhaps on account of the submission by both counsel that they would have
no objection "if the suit is disposed of finally." However, he fairly stated
that subject to the interim directions passed by the Court in the present
appeals being maintained, the Respondent Plaintiffs were prepared for the
suits to be revived before the learned Single Judge and to proceed to the next
stages in terms of the CPC and CCA.
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 13 of 20
Question (i) Whether the learned Single Judge could have, merely on the basis
that counsel for both parties agreed to the „final disposal of the suit‟,
dispensed with the further stages of framing of issues and recording of
evidence as mandated by the CPC as further modified by the Commercial Courts
Act, 2015 (CCA)?
28\. The two suits out of which the present appeal arises were undoubtedly IPR
suits and therefore commercial suits within the definition of Section 2 (1)
(c) read with Section 17)of the CCA. The stage at which both suits were at the
time of passing of the impugned order was that admission/denial of documents
had been completed following the completion of pleadings. The next stages in
the suits were the settlement of issues in terms of Order XIV CPC. Since these
were commercial suits, there also had to be, in terms of Order XV-A case
management therein. In such case management hearing in terms of Order XV-A
Rule 2, the Court had to pass an order framing the issues in accordance with
Order 14 CPC. It had to finalise the list of witnesses to be examined by the
parties and fix the dates by which affidavits of evidence had to be filed by
the parties. Thereafter, evidence of witnesses had to be recorded and written
arguments were to be filed by the parties. It had to fix the date on which
oral arguments had to be heard, settle time limits for that purpose and
thereafter completed and ensured that arguments were closed not later than six
months from the date of the first case management hearing.
29\. When both counsel informed the learned Single Judge, as recorded in para
7 of the impugned judgment in each of the suits, that they had "no
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 14 of 20 objection if the suit is disposed
of finally", they should not have been understood by the learned Single Judge
to have agreed to the dispensing with the abovementioned procedure to be
followed under the CPC read with the CCA. The above stages could not have been
dispensed with except in the manner contemplated under the CPC read with the
CCA.
30\. Order XIII A inserted in the CPC by way of the Schedule to the CCA is
titled „summary judgment‟. Under the said provision an Applicant can apply for
a summary judgment at any time after summons had been served on the Defendant.
The grounds on which a summary judgment could be given has been specified in
Order XIIIA Rule 3. The procedure thereunder has also been clearly specified.
The question of the trial judge suo motu, and without a formal application by
the parties, exercising the power under Order XIII A CPC to deliver a „summary
judgment‟ does not arise. As explained by a Division Bench of this Court in
Bright Enterprises Private Ltd. v. MJ Bizcraft LLP 236 (2017) DLT 295 "23.
From the provisions laid out in Order XIIIA, it is evident that the
proceedings before Court are adversarial in nature and not inquisitorial. It
follows, therefore, that summary judgment under Order XIIIA cannot be rendered
in the absence of an adversary and merely upon the inquisition by the Court.
The Court is never an adversary in a dispute between parties."
31\. Therefore, while the dispensing of recording of oral evidence can take
place in terms of Order XIIIA CPC but that again has to be strictly in
accordance with the procedure specified thereunder. Even Order XIIIA CPC does
not dispense with the framing of issues. Interestingly, in the present case in
both suits the applications filed by the present Appellant under XIIIA
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 15 of 20 CPC were dismissed. In other
words, there was no application pending before the learned Single Judge under
that provision by any of the parties i.e. either the Plaintiff or the present
Appellant seeking the dispensation of oral evidence being recorded in the
relevant suits. Therefore, there was no occasion for the learned Single Judge
to have adopted the course whereby all further stages in the suits could have
been dispensed with and the learned Single Judge could straightway pass the
final judgment and decree in both suits.
32\. The Court finds that the findings of the learned Single Judge to the
effect that the Appellant is not merely an intermediary within the meaning of
the IT Act and is therefore not entitled to the protection under Section 79
thereof was rendered without any evidence having been led by the Plaintiff and
without the present Appellant having a chance to challenge the said evidence
and also lead evidence in its behalf. Likewise, the specific findings rendered
in para 18 against the present Appellant as regards the role of the Appellant
herein as that of an intermediary was merely based on the pleadings in the
suit without there being any evidence led by the parties. These findings were
certainly adverse to the Appellant and could not have been rendered without
following the procedure established by law.
33\. So then how should have the learned Single Judge proceeded when counsel
for the Plaintiff and the Appellant herein stated that they were agreeable to
'the final disposal of the suit'? First, it was necessary to refer to the
governing provisions of the CPC and the CCA and notice that the stages of
striking issues had not been crossed and to record the parties' statements
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 16 of 20 on the agreed issues that arose
for determination on the basis of the pleadings. Thereafter even if one were
to consider the submission of the parties to be relatable to order XIII-A CPC,
it was necessary to insist on a written application thereunder and thereafter,
to contemporaneously record on oath the statements of the authorised
representatives of the parties that they were agreeable to dispensing with the
leading of evidence and for the suit to proceed to final arguments on the
basis of the affidavits on record. This Court would insist on the
'contemporaneous' or 'immediate' recording of such statements to obviate a
plea later on by any of the parties that no such statement was made or that
counsel appearing on their behalf was not authorised to make such statements.
In a situation like the present one, where the parties were not presenting to
the Court a 'settlement' under Order XXIII Rule 3 CPC, but were still in the
adversarial mode wanting a finding on the issues, the Court has to ensure that
the parties understand the implications of agreeing to dispense with the
leading of evidence. In other words, the Court has to be satisfied that the
parties have voluntarily given up the right to not only cross-examine the
deponents of the affidavits against them but to also give up the right to lead
evidence in their respective defence.
34\. The recording by the learned Single Judge in the impugned orders in the
present matters that both counsel have "no objection if the suit is disposed
of finally", gives no indication whether the said „concession‟ was on the
instructions of the respective clients (and whether those giving the
instructions were authorised to do so). Also, since the said statement was
supposed to have been made on 28th July 2018 and the judgment came to be
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 17 of 20 delivered on 12th November 2018,
it has given room for one of the parties to contend in appeal that it had not
agreed to the dispensing with the striking of issues, and the recording of
evidence. Therefore, the need for some precautions while recording such
„concessions‟ by counsel which have implications for the parties in an
adversarial setting.
35\. Consequently, question (i) has to be answered in the negative. It is held
that could not have, merely on the basis that counsel for both parties agreed
to the „final disposal of the suit‟, dispensed with the further stages of
framing of issues and recording of evidence as mandated by the CPC as further
modified by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (CCA).
Question (ii) Were the findings and directions issued in respect of the
Appellant beyond the scope of the suits themselves inasmuch as they granted
reliefs not sought for by the Plaintiff itself in the suits?
36\. The suits proceeded to a final disposal without evidence having been led
by the parties. The learned Single Judge has in the impugned judgment rendered
adverse findings qua the website of the Appellant without an opportunity to
the Appellant to challenge the evidence, if any, of the Plaintiff on those
aspects or to lead evidence in its defence. For e.g., the finding that
"repeated sales of counterfeits have been encountered on the website" or that
"despite several infringement actions against it, the website doesn't seem to
be taking precautions to stop sale of counterfeits" does not appear to be
based on the „evidence‟ led even by the Plaintiff.
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 18 of 20
37\. Further, the Court finds that the numerous directions issued to the
present Appellant in para 20 were far beyond the scope of the pleadings in
each of the suits. The Plaintiff in each of the suits, had not sought any
direction from the Court that the website of the present Appellant should be
directed with immediate effect to disclose "the complete details of all its
sellers, their addresses and contact details on its website" and so on and so
forth. No such directions which went far beyond the scope of the pleadings in
either of the suits could have been issued by the learned Single Judge while
finally decreeing the two suits against the present Appellant.
38\. A civil suit, and in particular a commercial suit, has to proceed
strictly in terms of the procedure outlined in the CPC read with the CCA.
While speedy disposal of the suit is an intended objective of the CCA, the
provisions therein, which are by way of an amendment to the CPC, are not to be
by-passed in that process.
Conclusion
39\. The Court therefore sets aside the final judgement and decree dated 12th
November, 2018 passed by the learned Single Judge in each of the suits. The
Court restores both suits i.e. CS (COMM) No. 980/2016 and the pending IA
therein i.e. IA No. 24186/2014 as well as CS(COMM) No. 979/2016 and the
pending IA No. 24578/2014 to the file of the learned Single Judge and directs
them to be listed for directions on 6th May, 2019.
40\. As far as the interim direction is concerned, it is directed that in IA
No. 24186/2014 in CS(COMM) 980/2016, the earlier order dated 14th October,
RFA(OS)(COMM) 1/2019 & 5/2019 Page 19 of 20 2014 passed by the learned Single
Judge would continue to operate and further the statements made by the present
Appellant as recorded in para 8 and the further directions issued in para 9 of
the interim order dated 14 th January, 2019 passed by this Court in the
present appeal would continue to operate during the pendency of the suit.
41\. As far as IA No. 24578/2014 in CS(COMM) No. 979/2016 is concerned, while
the interim order dated 8th December, 2014 passed by the learned Single Judge
would continue to operate, the directions issued by this Court in para 6 (iii)
& (iv) in the order dated 1st February 2019 would also continue to operate
during the pendency of the suit.
42\. The appeals are allowed and the applications are disposed of in the above
terms.
