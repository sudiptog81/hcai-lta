Central Government Act
Section 17 in The Registration Act, 1908
17\. Documents of which registration is compulsory.—(l) The following
documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is situate
in a district in which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on
which, Act No. XVI of 1864, or the Indian Registration Act, 1866, or the
Indian Registration Act, 1871, or the Indian Registration Act, 1877, or this
Act came or comes into force, namely:—
(a) instruments of gift of immovable property;
(b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or operate to create,
declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any
right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one
hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable property;
(c) non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the receipt or payment of
any consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment,
limitation or extinction of any such right, title or interest; and
(d) leases of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding
one year, or reserving a yearly rent;
24 [(e) non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning any decree or
order of a Court or any award when such decree or order or award purports or
dissenting from; Bhobani v. Shibnath, (1886) 13 Cal 113. A lease for the life
of the lessee is a lease for a term exceeding one year as it entitles the
lessee to hold for more than one year if he lives so long. It is not a lease
terminable at the end of a year or at the option of the lessor. It therefore
requires registration; Parstrotam v. Nana, (1893) 18 Bom 109.
(iv) Sub-section 2(i) of section 17 merely provided that nothing in sub-
section 1(b) applied to a composition deed, but that did not mean that if a
document required registration under another enactment, it was valid without
registration; Govind Ram v. Madan Gopal, (1944) 721.A 76: AIR 1945 PC 74.
(v) A consent decree purporting to create a gift requires registration under
section 17(1)(a) and is not exempt from registration under section 17(2)(vi);
Kauleshwari v. Surajnath Rai, AIR 1957 Pat 456.
(vi) The only test under the present clause is whether the receipt purports to
extinguish the mortgage. If it does, it requires registration, but not
otherwise. A receipt for payment of money under a mortgage (other than an
endorsement on a mortgage-deed) issued by a mortgage mentioning not only the
order of a Court or any award when such decree or order or award purports or
operates to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present
or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of
the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable property:]
Provided that the 25 [State Government] may, by order published in the 26
[Official Gazette], exempt from the operation of this sub-section any lease
executed in any district, or part of a district, the terms granted by which do
not exceed five years and the annual rents reserved by which do not exceed
fifty rupees.

immovable property for the purpose of section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 (4 of 1882) shall be registered if they have been executed on or
after the commencement of the Registration and Other Related laws (Amendment)
Act, 2001 and if such documents are not registered on or after such
commencement, then, they shall have no effect for the purposes of the said
section 53A.]
(2) Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (l) applies to—
(i) any composition deed; or
(ii) any instrument relating to shares in a joint stock Company,
notwithstanding that the assets of such Company consist in whole or in part of
immovable property; or
(iii) any debenture issued by any such Company and not creating, declaring,
assigning, limiting or extinguishing any right, title or interest, to or in
immovable property except in so far as it entitles the holder to the security
afforded by a registered instrument whereby the Company has mortgaged,
conveyed or otherwise transferred the whole or part of its immovable property
or any interest therein to trustees upon trust for the benefit of the holders
of such debentures; or
(iv) any endorsement upon or transfer of any debenture issued by any such
Company; or
(v) 28 [any document other than the documents specified in sub-section (1A)]
not itself creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing any
right, title or interest of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards to or
in immovable property, but merely creating a right to obtain another document
which will, when executed, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any
such right, title or interest; or
(vi) any decree or order of a Court 29 [except a decree or order expressed to
be made on a compromise and comprising immovable property other than that
which is the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding]; or
(vii) any grant of immovable property by 30 [Government]; or
(viii) any instrument of partition made by a Revenue-Officer; or
(ix) any order granting a loan or instrument of collateral security granted

instrument for securing the repayment of a loan made under that Act; or
31 [(xa) any order made under the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890, (6 of 1890)
vesting any property in a Treasurer of Charitable Endowments or divesting any
such Treasurer of any property; or]
(xi) any endorsement on a mortgage-deed acknowledging the payment of the whole
or any part of the mortgage-money, and any other receipt for payment of money
due under a mortgage when the receipt does not purport to extinguish the
mortgage; or
(xii) any certificate of sale granted to the purchaser of any property sold by
public auction by a Civil or Revenue-Officer. 32 [Explanation.—A document
purporting or operating to effect a contract for the sale of immovable
property shall not be deemed to require or ever to have required registration
by reason only of the fact that such document contains a recital of the
payment of any earnest money or of the whole or any part of the purchase
money.]

(i) An instrument of gift of immovable property requires registration under
this Act, whatever be the value of the property; Charan v. Sucha, (1921) 4 Lah
LJ 7.
(ii) The words 'create', 'limit' or 'extinguish' and 'right', 'title' or
'interest' imply a definite change of legal relation to the property by an
expression of will embodied in the document. The word 'declare' is ejusdem
genesis with the words 'create', 'assign' or 'limit'. It implies a declaration
of will, not a mere statement of a fact; Sakharan v. Madan, (1881) 5 Bom 232
approved by Privy Council in Bageshwari Charan v. Jagarnath Kuari, (1931) 59
IA 130, wherein it stated: "The distinction is between a mere recital of a
fact and something which in itself creates a title." When it is necessary to
determine whether an instrument other than a deed of gift purports or operates
to create an interest of the value of Rs. 100 or upwards in immovable property
within the meaning of section 17(1)(b) the test of value is the consideration
stated in the instrument; Nana v. Anant, (1877) 2 Bom 353. A deposit of title
deeds with the creditor by the debtor with the intent to create a security
implies in law a contract between the parties to create a mortgage and no
registered instrument is required under section 59 of the Transfer of Property
Act as in other case of mortgage. But if the parties choose to reduce the
contract to writing, this implication of law is excluded by their express
bargain and the document will be the sole evidence of its terms. In such a
case the deposit and the document both form integral parts of the transaction
and are essential in the creation of the mortgage. In such a case the document
which constitutes the bargain regarding security requires registration under
section 17 of the Act as a non-testamentary instrument creating interest in
immovable property where the value is Rs. 100 or upwards; United Bank of India
Ltd. v. Lakhram Sonaram & Co., AIR 1965 SC 1591. An instrument of partition of
immovable property requires registration as it declares an interest in
immovable property provided, however, the value of the interest so declared is
Rs. 100 or upwards; Siromoni v. Hemkumar, AIR 1968 SC 1299. But a writing
which merely states that there has in time past been a partition is not a
declaration of will but a mere statement of fact and it does not require
registration; Venkataraju v. Yudhkondalu, AIR 1958 AP 147.
(iii) The term 'consideration' used in this clause is a technical term. It
implies that the person to whom the money is paid himself declares, limits or
extinguishes his interest in immovable property in consideration of such
payment; Shidlingapa v. Chenbasapa, (1819) 4 Bom 235. A lease for one year
containing an option to the tenant to revenue for a further period of one year
or any other term is not a lease for a term exceeding one year and does not
requires registration under this clause; Boyd v. Kreig, (1890) 17 Cal 548
dissenting from; Bhobani v. Shibnath, (1886) 13 Cal 113. A lease for the life
of the lessee is a lease for a term exceeding one year as it entitles the
lessee to hold for more than one year if he lives so long. It is not a lease
terminable at the end of a year or at the option of the lessor. It therefore
requires registration; Parstrotam v. Nana, (1893) 18 Bom 109.
(iv) Sub-section 2(i) of section 17 merely provided that nothing in sub-
section 1(b) applied to a composition deed, but that did not mean that if a
document required registration under another enactment, it was valid without
registration; Govind Ram v. Madan Gopal, (1944) 721.A 76: AIR 1945 PC 74.
(v) A consent decree purporting to create a gift requires registration under
section 17(1)(a) and is not exempt from registration under section 17(2)(vi);
Kauleshwari v. Surajnath Rai, AIR 1957 Pat 456.
(vi) The only test under the present clause is whether the receipt purports to
extinguish the mortgage. If it does, it requires registration, but not
otherwise. A receipt for payment of money under a mortgage (other than an
endorsement on a mortgage-deed) issued by a mortgage mentioning not only the
payment of the full mortgage amount but also the extinction of mortgage
requires registration; Gurdial Singh v. Kartar Singh, AIR 1964 Punj 141. A
deed of adoption as distinguished from an authority to adopt does not require
registration; Vishwanth Ramji v. Rahibai, AIR 1931 Bom 105: 128 IC 901.
dissenting from; Bhobani v. Shibnath, (1886) 13 Cal 113. A lease for the life
of the lessee is a lease for a term exceeding one year as it entitles the
lessee to hold for more than one year if he lives so long. It is not a lease
terminable at the end of a year or at the option of the lessor. It therefore
requires registration; Parstrotam v. Nana, (1893) 18 Bom 109.

section 1(b) applied to a composition deed, but that did not mean that if a
document required registration under another enactment, it was valid without
registration; Govind Ram v. Madan Gopal, (1944) 721.A 76: AIR 1945 PC 74.

section 17(1)(a) and is not exempt from registration under section 17(2)(vi);
Kauleshwari v. Surajnath Rai, AIR 1957 Pat 456.
(vi) The only test under the present clause is whether the receipt purports to
extinguish the mortgage. If it does, it requires registration, but not
otherwise. A receipt for payment of money under a mortgage (other than an

executed in any district, or part of a district, the terms granted by which do
not exceed five years and the annual rents reserved by which do not exceed
