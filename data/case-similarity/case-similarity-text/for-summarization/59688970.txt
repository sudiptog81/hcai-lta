       C/o Boomerange, Unit No.506,
       5th Floor, Wing B-2, Chandivali Farm Road,
of the defendant appellant. However, if the suit ultimately fails, the harm
caused to the defendant appellant would be irreparable as it would be
difficult to compute the compensation. The balance of convenience was against
the passing of interim orders as prayed for in the petition.
For the reasons discussed above, the appeals are allowed and the impugned
judgment dated 1.3.2018 is set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

    				COMMON JUDGMENT	
These appeals are against a common order dated 1.3.2018 passed by the learned
Single Judge allowing two Interlocutory Applications being O.A. Nos.31 and 32
of 2018 in a Suit being C.S. (Comm) No.26 of 2018 filed by the Respondent No.1
[hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff respondent], against the Appellant
[hereinafter referred to as the defendant appellant] and the Respondent No.2
[hereinafter referred to as the defendant respondent] for inter alia
infringement of copyright in design and passing off.
2\. In the said suit, apart from damages, the plaintiff respondent claimed
inter alia,
(a)Grant a permanent injunction restraining the Defendants, their men, agents,
or persons acting on their behalf, from in any manner infringing the
Plaintiff's copyright in design Nos.276216 granted on 01/10/2015 in respect of
its tripod shaped base unit for its 'Preethi Zodiac' series of mixer grinders
by manufactuing, or offering for sale of selling any mixer grinders under the
name VIDIEM V-STAR SERIES or under any other name with features identical or
any manner similar to the Plaintiff's tripod shaped base unit design for mixer
grinders;
(b)Grant a permanent injunction restraining Defendants from in any manner
passing off the Plaintiff's tripod shaped base unit for its mixer grinders
marketed and sold under the name 'Preethi Zodiac' series by using identical/or
deceptively similar tripod shaped base unit design, shape or configuration,
and marketing and selling any model under the brand name VIDIEM V-STAR SERIES
or under any other name in any manner whatsoever.
3\. The plaintiff respondent filed two Interlocutory Applications in the said
Suit being O.A. Nos.31 and 32 of 2018 praying for the following orders:
(a)Grant an ad-interim injunction restraining the Respondents/ Defendants,
their men, agents, or persons acting on their behalf, from in any manner
infringing the Applicant/Plaintiff's copyright in design Nos.276216 granted on
01/10/2015 in respect of its tripod shaped base unit for its 'Preethi Zodiac'
series of mixer grinders by manufacturing, or offering for sale or selling any
mixer grinders under the name VIDIEM V-STAR SERIES or under any other name
with features identical or any manner similar to the Applicant/Plaintiff's
tripod shaped base unit design for mixer grinders;
(b)Grant an ad-interim restraining Respondent/ Defendants from in any manner
passing off the Applicant/ Plaintiff's tripod shaped base unit for its mixer
grinders marketed and sold under the name 'Preethi Zodiac' series by using
identical/or deceptively similar tripod shaped base unit design, shape or
configuration, and marketing and selling any model under the brand name VIDIEM
V-STAR SERIES or under any other name in any manner whatsoever;
(c)Any other relief as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit, in the circumstances
of the case, in the interests of justice and equity.
4\. Both the defendant appellant and the plaintiff respondent are engaged in
the manufacture and sale of kitchen appliances and are competitors in the
market.
5\. In the plaint, it is stated that in March 2016, the plaintiff respondent,
a subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips N.V., of the Netherlands launched a
multifunctional user-friendly mixer grinder 'Preethi Zodiac'.
6\. The multi utility and/or multifunctional features of the Preethi Zodiac
mixer grinder and/or the user-friendliness thereof are not relevant to the
issues involved in these Appeals.
7\. The plaintiff respondent claims that the base unit of the said Preethi
Zodiac mixer grinder has a unique design in the form of a tripod as depicted
below:
8\. According to the plaintiff respondent, the said design has duly been
registered under the Designs Act with effect from 1st October 2015 under
Registration No.276216.
9\. In the plaint, it is pleaded that the defendant appellant, erstwhile owner
of the brand Preethi which had later been sold to the holding company of the
plaintiff respondent, started manufacturing and selling kitchen appliances
under the new brand name Vidiem.
10\. The plaintiff respondent has alleged that in December 2017, the plaintiff
respondent came to learn that the defendant appellant had been manufacturing
mixer grinder under the brand name Vidiem V Star series with a tripod shaped
base unit, which was a fraudulent and obvious imitation of the registered
design of the plaintiff respondent.
11\. According to the plaintiff respondent, there is similarity in the overall
appearance of the base unit of the plaintiff respondents Preethi mixer
grinder and the base unit of the defendant appellant's mixer grinder sold
under the brand name Vidiem V star series.
12\. It is not in dispute that the design of the base unit of the defendant
appellant's mixer grinder sold under the brand Vidiem V Star series is also
registered under the Designs Act 2000 under Registration No.292910 with effect
from 17th April 2017. Of course, the design of the plaintiff respondent was
registered earlier. It may also be pertinent to note the pleading of the
plaintiff respondent in paragraph 28 of the plaint asserting that the
plaintiff respondent does not claim any monopoly on the tripod shape.
13\. The learned single Judge, after perusing the pleadings and the materials
on record and after hearing counsel appearing on behalf of the parties, found
that the defendant appellant had infringed the Copyright of the plaintiff
respondent in its registered design and granted a blanket order allowing both
the interlocutory applications. All the prayers in the two interlocutory
applications have been allowed, including the prayer for blanket injunction
restraining the defendant appellant from marketing or selling any model under
the brand name Vidiem V Star series or under any other name, in any manner
whatsoever.
14\. Mr.P.S.Raman, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant
appellant, submitted that compared as a whole, the base unit of the mixer
grinders of the defendant appellant is different from and not an obvious or
fraudulent imitation of the base unit of the Preethi mixer grinders of the
plaintiff respondent.
15\. Mr.Raman further submitted that the base units of the defendant
appellants Vidiem V star series were manufactured in accordance with the
Design Registration No.292910. Mr.Raman argued that the Patent Office
registered the design of the base unit of the defendant appellants mixer
grinder under the Designs Act 2000, after due examination on being satisfied
of its novelty and originality.
16\. Mr.Raman argued that the tests to be applied to determine whether use of
a design would amount to piracy under Section 22 of the Designs Act 2000 would
be:
(i)whether the impugned design varied substantially from the registered design
and, if so,
(ii)whether, notwithstanding difference and/or variation, the impugned design
is still to be considered obvious or fraudulent imitation.
17\. The Preethi mixer grinder of the plaintiff respondent and the Vidiem V
Star series mixer grinder of the defendant appellant were brought to this
Court and Mr. Raman demonstrated the differences between the base units of the
mixer grinder of the plaintiff respondent and the defendant appellant, by
physically comparing the two base units and also by comparison of the
pictorial depiction of the base unit in the plaint and other documents,
including documents obtained from the Patent Office.
18\. Mr.Raman demonstrated that the base unit of the plaintiff respondent had
a protruding front whereas the base unit of the defendant appellant had a non-
protruding front with a concave curve between the two legs on either side.
19\. Mr. Raman also pointed out that in the plaintiff respondents design, all
the four legs are visible, if seen from the front, but that is not so in the
defendant appellants design. In the defendant appellants design, only two
legs can be seen from the front but not the third leg.
20\. Mr.Raman next pointed out that the top view and the bottom views of the
two base units are substantially different in that the design of the
respondent plaintiff though triangular shaped, is six sided from the top and
from the bottom, whereas the design of the defendant appellant is a three
sided triangle with curved edges. Mr.Raman further pointed out that the rear
view of the base unit of the plaintiff respondent shows a concave curve
between two legs on either side whereas the base unit of the defendant
appellant shows all three legs with the third leg protruding at the back.
21\. Mr.Raman also pointed out that the base unit of the plaintiff respondent
was more rounded and/or circular above the legs whereas the defendant
appellants base unit was more aquiline with ridges on the side starting from
the top to bottom along the legs of the base unit.
22\. Mr.Raman argued that the above matters were not considered before
granting injunction restraining the use of a design on the ground of
infringement and/or piracy.
23\. Mr.Raman submitted that the learned single Judge fell in error in holding
that four out of six features on comparison of the plaintiff respondent and
the defendant appellant were identical. The conclusion, according to Mr.Raman,
is a generalisation which ignores obvious details, features and the
interpretation of features which are different.
24\. Mr.Raman proceeded to argue that even assuming that four features are
similar, the notable difference in the bottom view was vital, more since the
plaintiff respondent did not claim infringement on the feature of the
protruding legs. When the bottom view was different, obviously the contours of
the base unit of the defendant appellant resting on the edifice of the bottom
plate of the base unit would also differ.
25\. Mr.Raman argued that the learned single Judge should not have ignored the
difference in the bottom view and the top view on the ground that the consumer
would not be able to make out the difference. In judging a design, an article
had to be viewed as a whole.
26\. Mr.Raman pointed out that another vital feature of the design of the
defendant appellant was the tristar shaped backplate and the switch knob which
could not be placed anywhere on the body of the base unit, given the need for
a flat frontal surface. This highlights the very inspiration of the overall
design.
27\. Mr.Raman emphasised that the noticeable differences in these features
would clearly establish that the defendant appellant did not use the base unit
of the plaintiff respondent as a basis for its design. The difference in
individual element shows that the defendant appellants design is novel and
original, a design conceived by the defendant appellant on its own.
28\. Mr.Raman argued that the Honble Single Judge failed to note that the
plaintiff respondent had made an attempt to re-arrange the configuration of
the product of the defendant appellant in an attempt to display similarity.
Both the defendant appellant and the plaintiff respondent have design
registrations for both shape and configuration and the products would have to
be compared for their overall similarity as they are and not by removing any
of the elements of the configuration.
29\. Citing the judgment of a Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in
Whirlpool of India Pvt. Ltd. v. Videocon Industries Ltd., reported in (2014
(60) PTC 155 (Bom)), Mr.Raman argued that the Single Bench should have
considered the rival designs as a whole to see whether the impugned design was
substantially different from the design sought to be enforced. The learned
Single Bench patently erred in holding that on comparison of the designs of
the plaintiff respondent and the defendant appellant, the same would be found
identical. Such finding is a general finding which ignores obvious details and
features of the two designs, which were obviously different.
30\. Mr.Raman argued that the law does not protect any specific features but
the representation of such features as a whole referring to the single Bench
Judgment of this Court in Britannia Industries Ltd. v. Sara Lee Bakery,
reported in AIR 2010 Mad 49.
31\. Mr.Raman argued that in judging an article solely by the eye, the Court
is to see whether the infringement of the design is an obvious and/or a
fraudulent imitation. Mr. Raman also argued that learned Judge overlooked the
argument of the defendant appellant that the base unit of the grinder mixer of
the defendant appellant was inspired by a combination of tristar and Ninja
Throwing stars and not the design of the Plaintiff Respondent.
32\. Mr.Raman also argued that the design of the plaintiff respondent was only
a trade variant of the designs that already existed in the market and there
was no novelty in the market and there was no novelty in the said design.
However, since the design of the plaintiff respondent was registered before
the defendant appellants design was registered and the defendant appellant
has later also registered tripod shaped design, it is not open to the
defendant appellant to question the novelty of the plaintiff respondents
registered design.
33\. Mr.Raman finally argued that there were many mixer grinders in the market
with tripod shaped base. The plaintiff respondent was not the first to
introduce a tripod shaped mixer grinder. Furthermore, the plaintiff respondent
is not claiming monopoly over the tripod shape but is contending that the
novelty of its base unit lies in the feature of its three protruding legs in
the base unit of the mixer grinder and the concave shape of the bottom of the
plate.
34\. In support of his submission that the protection of the Designs Act, 2000
is invoked for the entire desgin that appears upon the register and is
applicable not to specific features, but the exact copy of the design
registered, Mr. Raman cited the decisions in Harish Chhabra v. Balaji
Electricals Ltd., reported in 2005 (3) Mh.L.J 962 and Samsung Electronics (UK)
Ltd. v. Apple Inc., reported in (2012) EWHC 1882 (Pat).
35\. Mr.Raman concluded that the product of the defendant appellant was more
streamlined and aquiline with sharp and unique dimensions as compared to the
thick and stubby base unit of the mixer grinder of the plaintiff respondent.
He submitted that the learned Single Bench has not only overlooked the
striking differences, but has also ignored the principles for grant of
equitable interim relief of injunction, that is the strength of the prima
facie case made out by the applicant for grant of interim injunction, balance
of convenience and irreparable injury to the applicant for injunction as a
consequence of refusal to grant injunction.
36\. Mr.Bharath appearing on behalf of the plaintiff respondent submitted that
the object of design registration was to ensure that the originator of a
profitable design was not deprived of his reward by others applying it to
their goods. In support of his submission, Mr.Bharath cited Bharat Glass Tube
Limited v. Gopal Glass Works Limited, reported in (2008) 10 SCC 657.
37\. Mr.Bharath aruged that when a consumer visits a store to buy a product
like a mixer grinder, the choice is made by looking at the mixer grinder
placed on shelves. A consumer would not turn the mixer grinder upside down to
look at the bottom and examine if there was any difference. The dissimilarity
of the bottom view of the base unit was, therefore, inconsequential, since the
bottom surface of the mixer grinder is invisible to a user.
38\. Citing the decision of the Delhi High Court in Alert India v. Naveen
Plastics, reported in 1997 (17) PTC 15 (Del), Mr.Bharath argued that for
determining if two designs were identical or not, it was not necessary that
two designs should be exactly the same, similarity in the broad features of
shape, configuration, pattern would amount to imitation of the design of one
by the other.
39\. In support of the submission that sameness of features does not
necessarily mean that the two designs must be identical in every respect,
Mr.Bharath also cited Dabur India Ltd. v. Amit Jain, reported in 2009 (39) PTC
104 (Del).
40\. Mr.Bharath argued that to judge whether there has been any infringement,
a design has to be looked as a whole. Mr.Bharath argued that considering the
commercial angle of design protection, differences on the surface or at the
top, not noticeable by a consumer, were inconsequential. It was the overall
visual appearance which was material.
41\. Mr.Bharath argued that minor differences in placement of the switch etc
would also not save a design that was an imitation of an earlier registered
design. The creator or designor has the right to explore his creativity
commercially.
42\. Referring to Whirlpool of India Ltd. v. Videocon Industries Ltd., supra,
Mr.Bharath argued that trivial and minor differences would not save a later
design from infringment, as otherwise it would be impossible for any plaintiff
to succeed, as a skillful infringer would invariably make some cosmetic and
minor changes in the design of its products. A mere dissimilarity in the
placement of switches is inconsequential. The defendant appellant has
replicated the plaintiff respondent's design with trivial changes to
inessentials such as the switch design.
43\. Mr.Bharath cited Videocon Industries Limited v. Whirlpool of India
Limited, reported in 2012 (6) Bom. CR. 178, where a Division Bench of the
Bombay High Court held that merely be placing certain ornamentations, changing
position of knbobs or adding colour scheme, Videocon has not made any
difference to its product so as to give it look of a completely different
shape than the product marketed by Whirlpool.
44\. Mr.Bharath submitted that design registration and/or infringement action
in respect of registered design attracts the principle of imperfect
recollection of a consumer. The consumer is guided by the principle of
appeal to the eye at the first instance, followed by the principle of
imperfect recollection.
45\. Mr.Bharath referred to the affidavit of the defendant appellant in
support of the stay petition and particularly paragraph 6.2 thereof, where the
defendant appellant has stated that the current market is evolving at a fast
pace and designs are transient. Taking cue from the aforesaid averment of the
defendant appellant, Mr.Bharath argued that the life of a design was short-
lived and as such the plaintiff respondent's prior and earlier registered
design had to be protected.
46\. Mr.Bharath further submitted that the plaintiff respondent and the
defendant Appellant were not strangers in the market. The plaintiff respondent
was part of the defendant appellant until 2011 following which the defendant
appellant entered into a Slump Sale Agreement with Koninklijke Philips, NV,
The Netherlands. Mr.Bharath argued that the defendant appellant and the
plaintiff respondent being siblings in the industry, the defendant appellant
was well aware of the prior registered eye-catching design of the plaintiff
respondent and should have been cautious not to adopt the same.
47\. Mr.Bharath next argued that it is an established principle of law that
injunction can be obtained agianst a registered design holder in a case of
design infringement. In support of his contention, Mr.Bharath cited Micolube
India Limited v. Rakesh Kumar Trading as Saurabh Industries and Others,
reported in 2013 (55) PTC 61 (Del), where a Full Bench of the Delhi High Court
observed that a plaintiff was entitled to approach the Court and plead that
his registered design was unique and the defendant registrant had obtained
registration which was neither new nor significantly distinguishable when
compared to the plaintiff's registered design.
48\. Mr.Bharath also cited Alert India, supra, for the proposition that a
design registered later would not be entitled to protection agianst first or
prior registered proprietor of design and Vikas Jain v. Aftab Ahmed, C.S.(OS)
No.1109 of 2005, where the Delhi High Court observed that prior registration
would entitle the registered proprietor to prevent infringement of its
registered design by a subsequently registered holder of the design.
49\. Mr.Bharath also cited the decision of the Bombay High Court in Whirlpool
of India Ltd., supra, wherein it was held that a defendant proprietor, who
holds a subsequent registration, cannot plead his subsequent registration in
defence to an action under Section 22, since a subsequent registration is no
defence within the meaning of Section 22(3) read with Section 19 of the
Designs Act.
50\. Mr.Bharath argued that the defendant appellant was seeking to get the
interim injunction vacated by misleading submissions, wrong modes of
comparison and taking inconsistent and/or contradictory stands.
51\. Mr.Bharath further argued that the defendant appellant had only sold
37468 mixer grinder units, which included all the variants of the Vidiem V
Star mixer grinders, despite important festivals of Diwali, Christmas, etc.
52\. Mr.Bharath also argued that the defendant appellant had not made any
application for cancellation of the registered design of the plaintiff
respondent.
53\. Citing a Full Bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in Metro Plastic
Industries v. Galaxy Footwear, reported in 2000 (20) PTC 1, Mr.Bharath argued
that in the absence of an application for cancellation of the design, such a
right cannot be enforced and no defence can be taken based on a ground of
cancellation.
54\. The propositions of law enunciated in the judgments cited by Mr. Bharath
are unexceptionable and they are not dealt with separately. However, whether
there is infringement of registered design or not is a question of fact and
each case for infringement has to be decided on its own merits. Observations
made in the context of an Ipad in the case of Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd. v.
Apple Inc., supra, cannot be applied in the case of washing machines or, for
that matter, other dissimilar product. Paragraphs and sentences in a judgment
cannot be read out of context, and have to be construed having regard to the
facts and circumstances of the case. A judgment is a precedent for authority
of law which is raised and decided and not that which can logically be deduced
therefrom.
55\. The Designs Act 2000, which repeals and replaces the Designs Act 2000,
aims to ensure effective protection of designs registered by the Controller
General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, hereinafter referred to as the
Controller, by making the system of the protection of industrial designs more
efficient.
56\. As held by the Supreme Court in Bharat Glass Tube Limited v. Gopal Glass
Works Limited, supra, cited by Mr.Bharath, the sole purpose of the Designs Act
2000 is to protect designs devised to be applied to particular articles which
might be manufactured and marketed commercially.
57\. The whole purpose of the Designs Act is to secure the rights of the
creator of an original and novel design to commercially exploit the design and
to prevent imitation thereof without approval. Once a design is registered
under the Designs Act 2000, a right accrues to the registered proprietor of
the design to prevent manufacture and sale of any article of the same or
similar design.
58\. The relevant provisions of the Designs Act 2000 are set out herein below
for convenience.

public order or morality, register the design under this Act:
Provided that the Controller shall before such registration refer the
application for examination, by an examiner appointed under sub-section (2) of
section 3, as to whether such design is capable of being registered under this
Act and the rules made thereunder and consider the report of the examiner on
such reference.
(2)Every application under sub-section(1)shall be in the prescribed form and

(4)Where any person makes an application for the registration of a design in
respect of any article and either-
(a)that design has been previously registered by another person in respect of
some other article; or
(b)the design to which the application relates consists of a design previously
registered by another person in respect of the same or some other article with
modifications or variations not sufficient to alter the character or
substantially to affect the identity thereof, then, if at any time while the
application is pending the applicant becomes the registered proprietor of the
design previously registered, the foregoing provisions of this section shall
apply as if at the time of making the application, the applicant had been the
registered proprietor of that design.
7.Publication of particulars of registered designs.-The Controller shall, as

other case in which he deems it expedient, furnish one or more copies of the
certificate.
10.Register of designs.-(1)There shall be kept at the patent office a book
called the register of designs, wherein shall be entered the names and
addresses of proprietors of registered designs, notifications of assignments
and of transmissions of registered designs, and such other matter as may be
prescribed and such register may be maintained wholly or partly on computer
floppies or diskettes, subject to such safeguards as may be prescribed.
(2)Where the register is maintained wholly or partly on computer floppies or
diskettes under sub-section (1), any reference in this Act to any entry in the
register shall be construed as the reference to the entry so maintained on
computer floppies or diskettes.
(3)The register of designs existing at the commencement of this Act shall be
incorporated with and form part of the register of designs under this Act.
(4)The register of designs shall be prima facie evidence of any matter by this
Act directed or authorized to be entered therein.
11.Copyright on registration.-(1)When a design is registered, the registered
proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have
copyright in the design during ten years from the date of registration.
(2)If, before the expiration of the said ten years, application for the
extension of the period of copyright is made to the Controller in the
prescribed manner, the Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed fee,
extend the period of copyright for a second period of five years from the
expiration of the original period of ten years.
22.Piracy of registered design.-(1) During the existence of copyright in any
design it shall not be lawful for any person-
(a)for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be applied to any article in
any class of articles in which the design is registered, the design or any
fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof, except with the licence or written
consent of the registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to enable
the design to be so applied; or
(b)to import for the purposes of sale, without the consent of the registered
proprietor, any article belonging to the class in which the design has been
registered, and having applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious
imitation thereof; or
(c)knowing that the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof has
been applied to any article in any class of articles in which the design is
registered without the consent of the registered proprietor, to publish or
expose or cause to be published or exposed for sale that article.
(2)If any person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be liable for
every contravention-
(a)to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a sum not exceeding
twenty-five thousand rupees recoverable as a contract debt, or
(b)if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery of damages for
any such contravention, and for an injunction against the repetition thereof,
to pay such damages as may be awarded and to be restrained by injunction
accordingly:
Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one design under
clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand rupees:
Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for relief under this
sub-section shall be instituted in any Court below the Court of District
Judge.
(3)In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), every
ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19
shall be available as a ground of defence.
(4)Notwithstanding anything contained in the second proviso to sub-section(2),
where any ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under
section 19 has been availed of as a ground of defence and sub-section (3) in
any suit or other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), the suit or
such other proceeding shall be transferred by the Court, in which the suit or
such other proceeding is pending, to the High Court for decision.
(5)When the Court makes a decree in a suit under sub-section (2), it shall
send a copy of the decree to the Controller, who shall cause an entry thereof
to be made in the register of designs.
59\. Design has been defined in Section 2(d) to mean only the features of
shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours
applied to an article whether in two or three dimensional or in both forms, by
any industrial process or mean, be it manual, mechanical or chemical, separate
or combined, which, in the finished article, appeal to and judged solely by
the eye.
60\. Whether the designs of two articles are identical, whether the design of
an article is a fraudulent imitation of some other design is to be judged by
the visual effect of the designs in issue.
61\. The article is to be judged as a whole, as argued by Mr.Bharath. Under
the Designs Act, a right has been conferred on the original creator of a
design. Section 4 thus prohibits the registration of a design which is not new
or original or has been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any
country by publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to
the date of filing of an application for registration and once a design is
registered, the registration takes effect from the date of filing of the
application for registration as provided under sub-Section (6) of Section 5 of
the Designs Act.
62\. In Gopal Glass Works v. Assistant Controller of Patent Designs and
others, reported in 2006 (33) PTC 434 (Cal), cited by Mr. Bharath, one of us
(Indira Banerjee, CJ) held that mere publication of designs, specific drawings
and/or demonstrations in connection with an application for registration would
not, in itself, amount to publication that would render a design registered in
India liable to cancellation.
63\. To constitute prior disclosure by publication to destroy the novelty of a
registered design, the publication would have to be in tangible form, of the
design applied to the same article. Prior publication of a trade catalogue,
brochure, book, journal, magazine or newspaper containing photographs or
explicit picture illustrations that clearly depict the application of the
design on the same article with the same visual effect would be sufficient.
64\. However, when the novelty of an article is tested against a prior
published document, the main factor required to be adjudged is the visual
effect and the appeal of the picture illustration. If the visual effect of the
pattern or shape or the combination of the pattern, shape, dimension, colour
scheme, if any, are not clear from the picture illustrations, the novelty
cannot be said to have been destroyed by prior publication, in the absence of
clear and unmistakable directions to make an article of the design which is
the same or similar enough to the picture illustrations.
65\. Once a design is registered, the registered proprietor of the design has
copyright in the design for a period of ten years from the date of
registration which may be extendable for a subsequent period of 5 years from
the date of expiration of the original period of 10 years.
66\. In view of Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Designs Act, the
registration of the design establishes prima facie evidence of any matter,
which by the Designs Act, 2000 is directed or authorised to be entered
therein. Thus, once a design is entered in the register, the registration
shall be prima facie evidence of originality and novelty of the design and
there will be a presumption that the design had not previously been published.
67\. However, such presumption is rebuttable. Once a design is registered, the
onus is on the person who questions the right of the holder of Certificate of
Registration to commercially exploit the design, to substantiate his claim to
relief.
68\. Section 19 of the Designs Act 2000 provides for cancellation of a
registered design, on a petition of an interested person, subject to the
following conditions:
(a)that the design has been previously registered in India; or
(b)that it has been published in India or in any other country prior to the
date of registration; or
(c)that the design is not a new or original design; or
(d)that the design is not registrable under this Act; or
(e)that it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.
69\. Fraudulent imitation of a registered design constitutes infringement and
piracy under Section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000. If there is infringement
and/or piracy, injunction has to follow in terms of Section 22 (2) of the said
Act.
70\. To attract Section 22, the resemblance between the designs need not be
identical, as long as it is a planned and an obvious imitation, although it
may be different from the original in some respects.
71\. In Dabur India Ltd., supra, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
followed inter alia an earlier judgment of the same High Court in Alert India
Ltd., supra, and held that:
17. The law in regard to similarity which constitutes infringement and which
in turn attracts an order of injunction has been explained by this Court in
Alert India Ltd (supra). Reference in the said case has been mae to an earlier
decision in J.N. Electricals (India) v. President Electricals, ILR 1980 (1)
Delhi 215 where it was explained that the sameness of features does not
necessarily mean that the two designs must be identical on all points and
should differ on none. They have to be substantially the same 36. Thus for
determining whether two designs are identical or not, it is not necessary that
the two designs should be exactly the same. The main consideration to be
applied is whether the broad features of shape, configuration, pattern etc.
are same or nearly the same and if they are substantially the same, then it
will be a case of imitation of the design of one by the other
18\. Likewise, in Castrol India Ltd, the Calcutta High Court explained that
the word imitation does not mean duplication in the sense that the copy
complained of need not be an exact replica. Reference was made to the earlier
decision of the said High Court in Best Products Ltd. V. F.W. Woolworth &
Company Ltd 1964 RPC where it was held that it is the article as a totality
that must be compared and contrasted with the features of a shape and
configuration shown in the totality observable frm the representation of the
design as registered. It was said that the Court must address its mind as to
whether the design adopted by the defendants was substantially different from
the design which was registered. The decision in Dunlop Rubber Co Ltd. V.
Golf Ball Developments Ld (1931) XLVIII RPC 268 is also a pointer to the
approach to be adopted by the Court when a complaint is made by a plaintiff of
fraudulent imitation of its design by a Defendant. It was observed a
fraudulent imitation seems to be an imitation which is based upon, and
deliberately based upon, the registered design and is an imitation which may
be less apparent than an obvious imitation; that is to say, you may have a
more subtle distinction between the registered design and a fraudulent
imitation and yet the fraudulent imitation, although it is different in some
respects from the original, and in respects which render it not obviously an
imitation may yet be an imitation, imitation perceptible when the two designs
are closely scanned and accordingly an infringement.
As explained in Hindustan Sanitaryware if the Court is able to find that,
there is substantial and sufficient resemblance between the allegedly
infringed designs and the Appellants registered designs, an injunction
should follow.
72\. There can be no doubt that injunction can be granted against any
subsequently registered proprietor. However, as observed above, registration
is prima facie evidence of existence of the conditions precedent for
registration and the onus is on the one who challenges the subsequent
registration, to establish that the subsequent registration was not a legal
and/or valid registration in law.
73\. An impugned design ought to be compared with features of shape and
configuration shown in totality in the design registration certificate. It is
also true that the two designs need not be identical. The word imitation
does not mean duplication. It does not have to be an exact replica. It has to
be seen whether the essential part of the impugned design is similar to the
essential part of the alleged infringing design.
74\. A comparison of the base unit of the mixer grinders of the defendant
appellant and the base unit of the mixer grinders of the plaintiff pespondent
from the pictorial depictions thereof in the written notes of submissions
submitted by Mr. Bharath makes it amply clear that even though there may be
some similarity, the designs are not so similar so to be considered as
fraudulent copy of the other.
75\. As argued by Mr.Raman, there are notable differences in the designs.
Moreover, as observed above, the plaintiff respondent does not claim monopoly
in the tripod shape. Whenever two designs are in conflict, the conflict has to
be decided having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. There
cannot be cast iron formula for determining if there is substantial
similarity. The courts have to apply the visual appeal test.
76\. The respective registered designs of the base unit of the Preethi
Zodiac mixer grinder of the plaintiff respondent and the Vidiem V Star Series
of the defendant appellant is illustrated with pictures herein below.
77\. In Gorham v. Company v. White, 81 US.14 Wall.511 (1871), the United
States Supreme Court held:
the question is not whether one design will be mistaken for another by a
person who examines the two so carelessly as to be sure to be deceived, but
whether the two designs can be said to be substantially the same when examined
intelligently side by side. There must be such a comparison of the features
which made up the two designs. As against an existing patented design, a
patent for another design cannot be withheld because, to a casual observer,
the general appearance of the latter design is so like that of the earlier one
as to lead him, without proper attention, to mistake the one for the other.
The same test must be applied on the question of infringement.
78\. We are in full agreement with the view taken by the United States Supreme
Court. The question is whether the two designs can be said to be substantially
the same when examined intelligently side by side. On a careful look at the
illustrations of the two registered designs, we do not find substantial
similarities which could be considered as fraudulent or obvious imitation.
79\. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that both the plaintiff
respondent and the defendant appellant are registered proprietors of their
respective designs. The plaintiff respondent does not claim any propriety on
the tripod. If the tripod is ignored, there is no similarity at all. The shape
of the three legs of the tripod is distinctly dissimilar, in that tripod of
the defendant appellant is triangular, whereas the tripod of the plaintiff
respondent is six sided. The outer end of the three protrusions at the base of
the plaintiff respondent's mixer grinder are squarish, whereas those of the
defendant appellant are more pointed. The illustrations of the respective
designs depicted herein above do not indicate such striking similarities as to
fall within the mischief of obvious and fraudulent imitation. There does not
also appear to be any real possibility of confusing the base unit of the
defendant appellant for that of the plaintiff respondent.
80\. In considering a prayer for interim relief, this Court has to consider
three important factors, prima facie case, the balance of convenience and
whether pecuniary compensation would afford the applicant for injunction,
adequate relief.
81\. There being no challenge till today to the defendant appellants
registration, we have to proceed on the prima facie basis that the design of
the defendant appellant is original, novel and had not been published prior to
the date of application for registration. The balance of convenience was also
against the interim orders being prayed for in the petit ion. If the plaintiff
respondent ultimately succeeds in the Suit, it would get necessary injunction
orders as also compensation for wrongful use of the registered design in
question. The compensation might be computed by taking into account the sales
of the defendant appellant. However, if the suit ultimately fails, the harm
caused to the defendant appellant would be irreparable as it would be
difficult to compute the compensation. The balance of convenience was against
the passing of interim orders as prayed for in the petition.
For the reasons discussed above, the appeals are allowed and the impugned
judgment dated 1.3.2018 is set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
