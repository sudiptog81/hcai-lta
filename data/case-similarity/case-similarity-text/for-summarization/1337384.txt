ORDER T.K. Jayaraman
1\. This is an appeal against the Order-in-Original No. 6/2003 dated
27.6.2003, passed by the Commissioner of Customs, Visakhapatnam.
2\. The brief facts of the case are follows:
(i) The appellants are a PSU unit engaged in the manufacture of Iron & Steel
products on their factory at Visakhapatnam. The steel melt shop at the factory
of the appellants has three converters in which liquid steel is manufactured.
The process of making liquid steel involves a process of blowing oxygen into
the converter. During the process of blowing oxygen into the converter, there
is a need to check various parameters like percentage of oxygen content,
carbon level, level of the liquid metal available etc. Sample is also drawn at
the time of blowing the oxygen. The checking of the above parameters and
drawing of the sample is done by an equipment called 'Sublance' which is
lowered from this purpose into the converter. The sublance is placed in its
position as part of a system with a host of other electrical and mechanical
equipments.
relate to the imported goods. There is no reason for including the same in the
CIF value of the goods imported. Moreover, the appellants have placed all the
facts before the EPCG Committee while getting the EPCG licence. They had also
placed all facts before the Customs Department at the time of clearance.
Hence, there is no evidence to show that the appellants had suppressed the
facts with a view to commit fraud to evade payment of duty. Hence, the longer
period for demanding duty cannot be invoked. As regards, the demand of Rs.
27,07,294 on account of shortfall in export obligation fulfilment, we cannot
uphold the Commissioner's findings. It is true that there was some delay in
fulfilling the export obligations within the date specified by the DGFT.
However, the appellants addressed the DGFT to extend the time and
consequently, the DGFT themselves accepted the export made after the
stipulated date. When the DGFT had issued the E.O. certificate by condoning
the delay, the Customs authorities cannot reject the condonation and demand
duty on the appellants. If this is allowed, this would make the entire system
of working of Government Departments a mockery. Therefore, we set aside the
equipments.
(ii) The appellants placed an order on M/s Kerala State Electronics
Development Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'KELTRON') vide
letter of intent dated 31.10.1989 for the design, manufacture and supply of
electric controls instrumentation, automation and sublance system for the LD
converter in the steel melting shop known as SMS) for a total value of Rs.
1717.09 lakhs. A total amounts of Rs. 1717.09 lakhs was made up of the
following four components:
(a) Design and Engineering charges for goods covered under Groups I to IV.
(b) Charges for the software package.
(c) Charges for supply of another equipments
(d) Training charges.
The goods covered by the groups I to IV included various items meant for the
entire/sublance system including the control panels, distributed control
system, computer terminals and the sublance per se. In addition to the above,
the appellant placed another letter of intent dated 31.10.1989 on KELTRON for
the unloading, transportation to site, storage, etc. and erection, testing and
commissioning of the electric controls, instrumentation, automation and
sublance system for the 3rd LD converter for a total value of Rs. 232.66
lakhs. The Foreign Exchange component in this contract was Rs. 106.10 for
deputation of foreign experts for erection and commissioning.
(iii) To execute the project of the appellants, KELTRON in turn entered into a
contract on 15.5.1991 with M/s Mannesmann Demag Huttwntechnik, Germany
(hereinafter referred to as 'MDH') which covered the design, engineering
including documentation, supplies and related services for Automatic Sublance
System LD3. The buyer in the contract was indicated as KELTRON and the seller
was MDH. Under Para 3.3, the seller scope of services was indicated as
providing the design, engineering including documentation, project handling
workshop tests, and inspection relating to the sublance system as specified in
Annexure I, III & IV. The Division list in Annexure-I indicated the source of
supply of the various items. The list in Annexure-I indicated the details of
supply of various items. The list also indicated that the sublance as an
equipment would be supplied by MDH while a host of other equipments like the
platform for the Hoist, the Guide column, the slewing mechanism were to be
supplied by KELTRON. The Division list also indicated that for the items to be
supplied by KELTRON, the design and engineering would be supplied by MDH. Para
10 of Annexure-I indicated that MDH would provide all the drawings for items
to be made by KELTRON. Annexure-III of the contract gave details of the design
and engineering for the entire system. The Annexure clearly indicated that the
above design was for integration of the entire sublance system. Annexure-IV of
the contract indicated the Schedule of Inspection of the various items
manufactured at various places. This Annexure clearly indicated that for the
sublance, the certificate from MDH would alone be relevant and for the other
items it would vary. The Annexure-V of the contract gave the time schedule for
the development of the design and for the manufacture of the goods. The
indication in the said Annexure that tests would be conducted at the workshop
before the goods are placed on board the vessel at the port of shipment
clearly indicated that it would apply only to the items manufactured at MDH.
The appellants accepted the tender of KELTRON vide letter dated 28.12.91. The
details of the tender are as follows:
     S.No. Description                                                   Value (Rs.)
    1.    Design and Engineering charges for Group I to IV including     254.08
          design and engineering for computer hardware and
          systems software as well as documentation.
    2.    Extension/modification of software package.                     39.10
    3.    Supply of equipment, commissioning spares, tools &            1422.47
          tackles, test jigs, etc.
    4.    Training                                                        11.19
             Total                                                      1727.56
Due to financial constraints of KELTRON, the appellants opened a letter of
credit dated 16.10.92 in favour of MDH. The appellants informed MDH vide
letter dated 16.10.92 of the opening of the letter of credit and also
confirmed and revised break up of prices after the increase of 2.5.% on the
contract value of KELTRON as under:
     S.No.  Description Value (in DM)
    1.    Design, Engineering including             1284850
          documentation, project handling,
          workshop test and inspection
    2.    Sublance Equipment                        2305700
    3.    Commissioning spares                       137190
    4.    Special Tool and tackles                   109400
    5.    Consumables                                  7860
          Total                                     3845000
The appellants while opening a letter of credit considered the value of the
sublance equipment, the commissioning, spares, the special tests and
consumables all under Group IV. Apart from the above, they also considered the
charges relating to project handling, workshop test, etc. relating to all the
Groups as indicated in Para 1.3 which in turn referred to Annexure-III and
Annexure-IV in the contract between KELTRON and MDH.
(iv) Afterwards the appellants applied to the DGFT vide application dated
28.12.93 for issue of an EPCG license to import and sublance by availing the
concessional rate of duty of 15% in terms of Notification No. 160/92-Cus dated
20.4.92. In the application, the CIF value of the goods to be imported was
indicated as DM 3845000 (Rs. 7,15,93,900). This amount was the same as the
amount for which the appellants opened a letter of credit. The appellants in
their application decided to include the design and documentation charges
relating to the project also as part of the value of the capital goods since
the Department in the past had raised a dispute regarding the inclusion of the
design charges in the value of capital goods. The EPCG Committee were however
of the view that the value of design, engineering and related services do not
relate to the capital goods imported. The DGFT after repeated meeting with the
representative of the appellants granted the EPCG license on 6.5.94 only for
DM 2560156 (Rs. 4,74,14,089) (after deduction the value of design engineering
including documentation, project handling, work shop tests and inspection
amounting to DM 1284850) and export obligation of 4 times the CIF value of the
imported goods to be completed within five years from the date of issue of
licence. This position has been made clear by the DGFT vide their letter dated
11.11.2003. In the meanwhile, the MDH has sent to KELTRON a list of drawings
for the entire equipments consisting of equipments supplied by them and the
other equipments to be provided at the site. KELTRON in turn provided the same
to the appellants vide their letter dated 12.2.1994. A perusal of list of
drawings indicates that the said drawings covered not only the goods supplied
by the MDH but other items to be provided by KELTRON also. In the meanwhile,
the KELTRON in turn placed a purchase order dated 6.4.1994 on M/s Raja
Corporation for supply of structural items for the sublance system. While
doing so, they provided drawings from MDH. KELTRON also informed MDH vide
letter dated 30.6.94 of the fact of placing order for supply of structural
items and requested MDH to approve the drawing provided by them to M/s. Raja
Corporation. MDH also issued a certificate dated 10.2.95 clearly stating that
the amount of DM 1269514 related to the design and engineering covering the
layout, installation arrangements of sublance, etc. required for the
installation and commissioning of sublance and that the drawings did not
pertain to the equipment supplied by them. The appellants imported the goods
in March 1995. They filed Bill of Entry and in the Bill of Entry indicated the
EPCG licence No. and the CIF value indicated therein. They also enclosed the
above certificate dated 10.2.95 from MDH. There was some delay in
commissioning and installation of sublance system. DGFT granted time upto
5.5.2000 to fulfil the export obligation but the appellants requested the DGFT
to grant extension upto 31.5.2000. The appellants intimated DGFT vide their
letter dated 17.8.2000 about the fulfilment of export obligation. The
appellants finally received the LUT release letter dated 19.2.2001 from DGFT
discharging them from the letter of undertaking executed on 6.5.1999. The
letter indicated that the release letter is being issued since they had
fulfilled the export obligation under EPCG licence No. 2133084 dated 6.5.94.
(v) A show cause notice dated 20.7.99 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner of
Customs demanding a differential duty of Rs. 4,60,56,996 since they have not
fulfilled the export obligation as per Notification No. 160/92-Cus. The notice
also alleged that the appellants were liable to pay duty amounting to Rs.
2,72,91,510 on the design and engineering charges since they were includable
in terms of Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) of the Customs Valuation Rules, 1988.
Subsequently, the appellants received a second show cause notice dated
29.12.99 from the Commissioner of Customs in supersession of first notice
dated 27.9.99. The notice alleged that the appellants failed to fulfil the
export obligation in terms of EPCG licence and, therefore, duty chargeable at
merit rate i.e. @ 65% + 20%; that the value of design and engineering was not
included in the assessable value; that the appellants had not disclosed the
design and engineering charges to the licensing authorities. The show cause
notice therefore proposed to demand differential duty of Rs. 7,33,48, 506;
interest on the duty amount from the date of clearance till the date of
payment, to confiscate the sublance system and ancillaries valued at Rs.
8,33,38,837 and also proposed to impose penalty on the appellants.
(vi) The Commissioner passed the impugned Order-in-Original dated 27.6.2003
wherein he has confirmed demand of duty Rs. 2,72,91,510 for non-inclusion of
value of design and drawings. He also confirmed a demand of Rs. 27,07,294
towards non-fulfilment of export obligation on the ground that one consignment
was exported after the date of expiry of 5 years from the date of issue of the
documents. The appellants are aggrieved over the decision of the adjudicating
authority. They strongly challenged the findings.
3\. Shri G. Shivadass, learned Advocate alongwith Shri Anil Kumar, learned
Advocate appeared for the appellants. Smt. Shobha L. Chary, learned JCDR
appeared for the Revenue.
4\. The learned Advocate for the appellants urged the following points:
(i) The Commissioner has held that since one consignment was exported on
29.5.2000, which is after 5.5.2000, the same is not to be taken into
consideration for the fulfilment of export obligation and has demanded payment
of duty of Rs. 27,07,294. Due to some unavoidable circumstances, the
appellants were unable to fulfil a small portion of the export obligation
amounting to US $ 409445.88 which was made on 29.5.2000. The appellants
requested the DGFT to extent the period upto 31.5.2000 i.e. by 25 days. On
submissions of the details of exports made by the appellants, the DGFT had
issued a release letter dated 19.2.2001 to the appellants informing them that
since the export obligation against the EPCG licence dated 6.5.94 has been
fulfilled, the letter of undertaking dated 22.7.94 executed by the appellants
has been discharged. Since the DGFT is final authority as far as monitoring of
fulfilment of export obligation is concerned, the Commissioner should have
accepted the release letter issued by the DGFT to the fact that export
obligation has been fulfilled and the letter of the DGFT is binding on the
Customs authority. Further, Notification No. 160/92-Cus., dated 20.4.92 has
been amended in 2001 retrospectively with effect from 1992 by introduction of
Clause (iv) whereby the period of export obligation has been extended till
31.3.2002. This amendment has been taken note by the Tribunal in the case of
Tecumseh Product India Ltd. v. CC, . In view of the above, the demand of Rs.
27,07,294 is liable to be set aside.
(ii) A demand of duty of Rs. 2,72,91,510 is on account of the inclusion of the
cost of design and engineering charges attributable to the sublance system
imported, it is held liable to be included in terms of Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) of the
Customs Valuation Rules, 1988. It was submitted that the above amount is for
the design and engineering of the activity done in India for the manufacture
of various items in India. The learned Advocate pointed out to Annexure I,
Item 4 of the contract wherein the Division List clearly indicates that many
items of work are to be carried out in India at the erection site. The thrust
of the Counsel's argument is that the design and engineering charges do not
relate to the equipments imported by them. They relied on the certificate
dated 10.2.95 issued by MDH much before the goods were received stating that
the amount in question relates to layout, installation, etc. and not to the
equipments supplied to the appellants. The appellants relied on the decision
of the Tribunal in the case of Guhring India Pvt. Ltd. v. CC, [Final Order No.
125 dated 19.1.2005] of the Bangalore Bench wherein it was held that the
supplier of the drawings and designs would be the best person to clarify the
nature of the drawings.
(iii) The Commissioner has rejected the certificate issued by the MDH by
observing that it is bland and obtained 4 years after the agreement. It was
submitted that the said rejection is without any basis especially when the
certificate conveys what is required to be conveyed and is in continuation of
the agreement. The fact that it is obtained 4 years after the agreement is
irrelevant so long as such a certificate has been produced at the time of
import of the goods in 1995.
(iv) The findings of the Commissioner are based on incorrect reading of the
entire contract and various letters exchanged between the parties particularly
the letter given by the supplier himself. A correct reading of the entire
contract would clearly prove that the design and engineering does not relate
to the imported goods, etc.
(v) Even if it is assumed that the entire amount is attributable to the
imported capital goods, the Revenue should be in a position to prove that the
appellants had made other payment to MDH who had provided/approved all these
drawings free of cost. If the Revenue is not in position to do so, then the
evidences given by the appellants and the certificate given by the supplier
are to be accepted, especially when the item imported is a standard off the
shelf product which price would take into account the amount attributable to
its designing and drawing.
(iv) Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) of the Customs Valuation Rules cannot be invoked to add
the basic engineering fees to the value of the capital goods imported. The
above rule will come into play only in a situation where any engineering
development or art work, etc. has been supplied by the buyer free of charge or
at reduced cost. Further, requirement of this rule is that such engineering,
development or art work, etc. should have been undertaken elsewhere than in
India and it should be necessary for the production of imported goods. It is
nobody's case that the buyer i.e. the appellants had supplied any engineering,
development or art work etc. to the exporter. It is also not the case of the
Revenue that the imported goods were made with reference to any engineering,
development or art work etc., supplied by the appellants free of charge to
others who in turn had supplied them to MDH. Hence, Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) is not
applicable to the facts of the present case.
(vii) The Apex Court in the case of Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. CCE & C,
Bhubaneswar, 2000 (116) ELT 422 (SC) has held in Para 14 that Rule 9(1)(b)(iv)
would apply only when the buyer has supplied free of cost any goods or
services which not been included in the value of the imported goods.
(viii) The Supreme Court relying on the Interpretative Note to Rule 4 has also
held that the charges for construction, etc. of goods in India are not
includible in the value of the goods imported.
(ix) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. has
followed the under-mentioned decisions:
(a) TISCO v. CC, 2001 (130) ELT 327 (T)
(b) Hindalco Industries v. CC, 2001 (129) ELT 245 (T)
(c) Birla Tyres v. CC, 2001 (138) ELT 628 (T)
(x) In the following decision, the Tribunal has held that post-importation
charges such as erection, etc., are not includible in the value of the
imported capital goods:
(a) CC v. VSP, 1992 (62) ELT 833 (T)
(b) SRF Ltd. v. CC, 2003 (161) ELT 721
(c) GE Plastics Ltd. v. CC, 2004 (94) ECC 257 (T)
(d) Indo Gulf Fertilisers v. CC (182) ELT 77
(xi) The Customs authorities cannot revise value of the licence once the DGFT
has fixed the value. The export obligation is fixed based on the CIF value
which is decided by the DGFT. Once a licence is issued indicating CIF value
and export obligation is fulfilled based on this, any revision of the
conditions mentioned in the licence can be made only by the Licensing
Authority. Any revision of the CIF value would mean revision of the export
obligation which can be done only by the DGFT and not by the Customs
authorities.
(xii) In the instant case, the appellants applied for EPCG licence vide letter
dated 28.12.93 wherein they had mentioned the CIF value of the goods to be
imported in item 20 of the application as DM 3845000 i.e. inclusive of design
and engineering charges. Further Annexure-5 gave a detailed break up of the
above-said value. The EPCG Committee of the DGFT, which includes a
representative from the Customs was of the view that the value of design,
engineering and related services is to be deducted from the CIF value and
consciously excluded the value of design and engineering charges while
granting the licence. This was done apparently because the design and drawing
charges are not relatable to the capital goods to be imported by the
appellants. Even if the Customs representative in the EPCG Committee was of
the view that designing and drawing did not relate to the capital goods being
imported, a different view cannot be taken now especially after the export
obligation has been fulfilled.
(xiii) The Customs authorities could have raised the objections regarding the
valuation arrived at by the DGFT at the time of import of the goods when all
the documents were available with them. The appellants would have approached
the DGFT for revision of export obligation. It would tantamount to great
jeopardy, if the appellants are now being asked to revise the CIF value of the
machinery imported without a revision of the export obligation and the
extension of the concessional rate of duty. This is precisely the view taken
by the Tribunal in the following cases:
(a) Jindal Vijayanagar Steel Ltd. v. CC, 2001 (131) ELT 667
(b) Hy-Grade Pellets Ltd. v. CC, Apparently in pursuance to the observations
of the Tribunal in the case of Hy-Grade Pellets Ltd. (supra), the Government
has issued a Circular dated 26.7.2004 explaining the role of the
representative of the Customs in the EPCG Committee.
(xiv) It is further submitted that the sublance would be covered by the EPCG.
It is precisely to avoid such anomalies that the DGFT issues a licence after
taking into consideration all the aspects of the goods to be imported. The
Customs authorities are therefore bound by licence issued and the value as
determined by the Licensing Authority. The following case laws were relied on:
(a) Titan Medical Systems Ltd. v. Union of India (UOI),
(b) Wearon Exports (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (UOI),
(c) Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. CCE, Final Order No. 950/04 dated 21.5.2004
(d) Gaur Impex v. CC, 2004 (94) ECC 45
(e) DSL Software and Ors. v. CC,
(xv) In terms of the Notification No. 160/92, as per condition No. (iii), the
importer has to bind himself to pay on demand an amount equal to duty leviable
but for the exemption, if the condition in the table to the Notification,
namely fulfilment of export obligation is not fulfilled. In the present case,
condition (iii) cannot be invoked as the export obligation has been fulfilled.
Even if the assessable value of the capital goods under Section 14 is to be
revised by the Customs authorities, the duty on such revised value would get
exempted since the export obligation has been fulfilled. This is precisely a
reason while fixing CIF value of the capital goods, the CBEC representative as
part of the EPCG Committee has a vital role to play and once such a value is
fixed and the resultant export obligation is fulfilled, any revision in the
value cannot result in demand of duty.
(xvi) The Commissioner has not invoked any provision of law in raising the
demand of duty of Rs. 2,72,91,510 towards the value of design and engineering
charges and Rs. 27,07,294 towards non-fulfilment of export obligation.
(xvii) In the present case, no demand can be made based on the provisions of
Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 either within six months or five years
from the relevant date. The longer period can be invoked only when there is a
suppression of material facts. All relevant information was furnished at the
time of import and the authorities were very much aware of the EPCG licence
had the break up in the invoice. In view of this position, there is no ground
for invoking the longer period. The goods were imported in March 1995 and the
show cause notice has been issued in December 1999. Since the longer period
cannot be invoked, the demand is time barred.
(xviii) The Commissioner has confiscated the goods under Section 111(m) of the
Customs Act, 1962 holding that the appellants had misdeclared the value of the
goods both the Licensing Authority and Customs authority with a view to evade
payment of duty. As stated earlier, the appellants applied to the DGFT for the
full value including the design and engineering charges. Once the licence was
issued for a lesser value, the appellants were of the bonafide belieft that
the design and engineering charges are not liable to duty. When a Government
authority competent to issue the EPCG licence does not consider the value of
design and engineering charges, the appellants cannot be held liable for the
non-inclusion of the same. Moreover, the appellants did not import the said
design and engineering and the same was imported by KELTRON which was
subsequently handed over to the appellants. In view of the above, the demand
of duty, the penalty imposed, confiscation ordered and the redemption fine are
required to be set aside.
5\. The learned JCDR made the following submissions:
(i) As per Para 35 of the Order-in-Original the contract in question is a
comprehensive one covering not only the supply of goods but also providing
design and engineering for the manufacture of such goods and also to subject
the goods so manufactured to tests using the design and engineering, before
shipment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mukund Ltd. v. CC, Mumbai,
2000 (120) ELT 30 (SC) held that when a contract provides for supply of basic
design and engineering drawings and the supervision of erection, testing and
commissioning based thereon, one is as much a part and a condition of the
contract as the other and, therefore, additional of supervision charges to the
assessable value is sustainable. That is, the Apex Court held that even
charges incurred subsequent to the import are includible in the assessable
value. In this case there was a single contract covering both supply of
equipment as well as relating services such as design and engineering, project
handling, documentation, tests and inspection. Further, the amount charged for
these services DM 1253100 - covered all these services and not just design and
engineering. All these activities were undertaken abroad prior to delivery and
as per the terms of payment 90% payment was to be made on delivery on board
vessel at port of shipment and the remaining 10% on completion of delivery
(page 18 of contract). The commercial invoice raised was for a single amount
without any break up. In view of these factors, the entire payment represents
the transactions value for payment of customs duty.
(ii) With reference to the argument that the design and engineering charges
were for manufacturing activity to be undertaken in India, this argument is
not supported by the provisions of the contract. The contract does not make
any distinction between design and engineering charges for manufacture abroad
and manufacture in India. On the other hand, the contract makes it abundantly
clear that there is considerable design and engineering work to be undertaken
for the main equipment and this work was to be completed within three months
of entering into the contract. After completion of engineering work, the buyer
was to give his approval and then manufacture was to be undertaken, followed
by tests and inspection. Refer Time Schedule in the contract page 102,
Annexure V. In view of the above, it is clear that the charges where primarily
for pre-importation activities. It is conceded that the Division List (Page 72
of the contract) does show the supply of engineering by the seller to the
buyer for 8 items only. But no split up value is available for consideration
as to whether any deduction is admissible. Reference is also invited to pages
21, 43, 48, 89, 90, 93 (Annexure III), 99 (Annexure IV) and page 102 (Annexure
V).
(iii) Reference is also invited to the Acceptance of Tender document ad
dressed by VSP to KELTRON dated 28.12.91 at page 204 of the paper book, Vol.
1. Annexure 1 to this document at page 207, Paras 1.1. and 1.2 and 1.6.1
clearly indicate design and supply of drawings and documentation for the
entire project to be supplied by the contractor, KELTRON. At page 210, the
price break up for the various items of work is stated. At Sl.No. 1 design and
engineering charges for Group I to IV including design and engineering charges
for computer hardware etc. are shown. Group IV at page 228 at Sl. 101
specifically includes the sublance proper. Thus, the contract between VSP and
KELTRON clearly shows that the design and engineering charges to be paid
covers the imported equipment and only a portion was for the structural and
electronic equipment to be manufactured in India.
(iv) An argument has been advanced that the design and engineering charges are
already included in the cost of the main equipment. Nowhere in the contract or
any of the correspondence of VSP, internal, with KELTRON and with the
Licensing Authorities, filed in the paper book is there anything to support
this statement. On the other hand, the contract itself makes a clear
distinction between the supply of equipment and the supply of related services
such as design etc. Refer page 5 of the contract. This argument of the
appellant is clearly not sustainable.
(v) Considerable reliance has been placed by the appellants on the beneficiary
certificate stated to be from the supplier in which it is clarified that the
entire amount of DM 1269514 - pertains to design and engineering which covers
layout, installation arrangements, instrumentation, electrical and hydraulic
equipment etc. and that these drawings do not come under manufacturing and
drawing category. The department has not accepted this certificate primarily
because this statement is a total departure from the contract. In the first
place the amount was collected not just for design and engineering but also
for project handling, documentation tests and inspections (Para 3.3. at page 7
and 4.1.1 at page 9). Definition of 'Services" at Para 1.3 at page 5 of the
contract indicates that the scope covers the division List as well as Annexure
III and IV. Secondly, the contract between VSP and Keltron also does not
support this contention. In the absence of any explanation for this deviation
from the contract in the certificate, the department has relied on the
contract in terms of which this amount of DM 1253100 related to various pre-
importation activities connected with the imported goods.
(vi) The show cause notice has cited Rule 9(1)(b)(iv) of the Customs Valuation
Rules. No doubt the department's case here is not that there was free supply
of any service by the buyer. But the buyer has entered into a comprehensive
contract for supply of both goods as well as design and engineering services.
Therefore, the payments made are correctly to be included in the assessable
value. Rule 9(1)(e) of the Customs Valuation Rules also includes all payments
made as a condition of sale. It is a settled position that citing of
inapplicable rules will not vitiate the proceedings if they are otherwise
correct in law. It is also pointed out that this contention was not taken up
before the adjudicating authority.
(vii) With regard to argument that Customs do not have the authority to alter
the value fixed by the licencing authorities in the EPCG licence and that if
any such issue arose, the department should have brought it to the notice of
the licensing authorities, it is submitted that both the order in the case of
Hy-Grade Pellets relied upon and the Board's Circular are subsequent to the
adjudication of this case. Therefore, the procedural requirements prescribed
in the Circular and the view expressed in the Hon'ble Tribunal's order that
the licencing authorities should be informed so that the export obligation
could be re-determined could not be followed in this case. However, if as per
the Customs law any additional amount is included in the assessable value
which is not covered by the value indicated in the EPCG licence, there is
legally no option but to deny the duty benefit under the EPCG scheme and levy
duty at normal rates unless the licence is further amended. The concessional
rate cannot be extended if the amount is not covered by the licence.
(viii) Following case laws are also relied upon:
(a) Mukand Ltd. v. CC (Airport) Mumbai, 2000 (120) ELT 30 (SC)

(ix) On all other issues covered in this appeal, findings in the Order-in-
Original are reiterated.
6\. We have gone through the records of the case carefully. The following
issues have to be decided in this case:
(i) Whether the design and engineering including documentation, project
handling, workshop test and inspections re (sic) to be included in the
assessable value for payment of Customs duty on import of Sublance System LD-3
by Visakhapatnam plant of M/s Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. under Rule
9(1)(b)(iv) of the Customs Valuation Rules, 1988 in the facts and
circumstances of the case?
(ii) Whether the export obligation has been fulfilled by the appellants in
terms of EPCG licence granted to them?
(iii) Whether the impugned goods are liable for confiscation?
(iv) Whether the appellants are liable to penalty under Section 112A of the
Customs Act, 1962:
The appellants wanted an Automatic Sublance System LD-3 to be installed in
their steel melt shop (SMS-1) in the premises of Visakhapatnam Steel Project.
In fact, they were interested to give the work to KELTRON. M/s KELTRON in turn
entered into an agreement with the MDH, Germany. This agreement covers design,
engineering including documentation, supplies and related services. The
agreement is a very comprehensive one. It is seen that the entire Automatic
Sublance System has not been imported from the MDH. The imported capital goods
are mentioned in Para 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4. For installing the
Automatic Sublance System from the imported capital goods, other goods
manufactured and procured in India were also needed. The contention of the
appellants is that the design and engineering charges represent the charges
incurred in connection with the goods manufactured and procured in India and
not related to the imported goods. In this connection, the appellants have
referred to the Division Lists. The Division Lists indicates the items which
will be imported from the seller (MDH) and also the items to be procured in
India. The contention of the appellants is that the design and engineering
charges related to the design of the items to be manufactured in India. This
design is carried out by MDH and for that purpose, the said charges were paid
to them. In other words, the above charges were not paid to MDH for the design
of the equipment imported from the MDH, namely Sublance System. A perusal of
the Division Lists shows that the platform for Hoist has to be procured from
India. However, its engineering is by MDH as shown in remarks column 6 of the
Division Lists. Similarly, in respect of many items even though the
procurement is from India by the buyer, the engineering is by MDH. Therefore,
the contention of the appellants cannot be easily brushed aside. Moreover, the
appellants even prior to the import of the equipments had furnished a
certificate from the foreign suppliers. The certificate is reproduced below:
"This is to certify that the amount of DM 1.269.514 invoiced against 4.1.1 of
our invoice No. 101 515 dtd. 8.6.1994 (B/L No. 1 dtd. 20.6.1994 - "MV STATE OF
TRIPURA) pertain to Design and Engineering which covers Layout, Installation
Arrangements of Sublance and its Accessories, General Layout Drawings of
Electrical Equipment, Instrumentation Equipment and Hydraulic Systems and Lay
Out Drawings for other Utilities like Nitrogen and Water and Emergency Lifting
arrangement etc., required for installation and commissioning.
This is also to certify that these drawings do not come under manufacturing
drawings/category of our equipments supplied to you."
A combined reading of the Division Lists and also the certificate given by the
MDH shows that these charges did not relate to the equipment imported. In any
case, the certificate dated 2.10.1995 was produced even before the import of
the equipments in March 1995. Obviously at the time of the clearance of the
goods, the Customs Department has not questioned the bona fide of the
certificate. Again the correspondence of the appellants with the DGFT shows
that the appellants actually wanted these charges to include in the EPCG
licence. But EPCG Committee in its wisdom took a conscious decision to exclude
these charges. This is clear from the following letter addressed by the DGFT
to the appellants. The letter dated 11.11.2003 is reproduced below:
"GOVERNMENT OF INDIA MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES (DIRECTORATE GENERAL
OF FOREIGN TRADE) MAULANA AZAD ROAD, UDYOG BHAWAN, NEW DELHI-110011 F. No.
18/1404/AMS4/EPCG-II Dated 11.11.2003 To The Deputy Manager, Rashtriya Ispat
Nigam Ltd., Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, 6th Floor, Prakashdeep Building, 7,
Tolstoy Marg, New Delhi-110001.
Sub : Clarification sought with regard to EPCG Licence No. P/CG/2133084 dated
6.5.1994.
Gentlemen, With reference to your letter dated 3.11.2003 on the above-
mentioned subject, I am directed to inform you that your request has been
examined by the office. On perusal of the file, it is observed that after
Personnel hearing of your representative, Shri Sanjay Dargan, Manager
(Exports) in EPCG Committee meeting held on 21.2.94 and on comments of
technical authorities in subsequent EPCG Committee meeting held on 25.4.94,
the Committee decided to exclude the items mentioned at Sl.No. 1 & 5 of the
break up list of the CGs provided by the Company i.e. Design Engineering
including documentation project handling work shop tests and inspection, which
did not cover under the EPCG scheme.
You are therefore informed that pursuant to the decision of the EPCG
Committee, a licence (No. P/CG/2133084) was issued to Rashtriya Ispat Nigam
Ltd. for a CIF value of DM 2560156 (Rs. 47414089) instead of a CIF value of DM
3845000 as applied for by reducing the value of licence accordingly after a
personnel hearing of Co.'s representative."
Yours faithfully, Sd/-xxxxxxxxx (N. SRIVASTAVA) FOREIGN TRADE DEVELOPMENT
OFFICER FOR DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FOREIGN TRADE"
From the above letter, it is clear that the appellants wanted the CIF value of
the licence for DM 3845000 but the EPCG Committee issued only for CIF value DM
2560156. It is very clear that the EPCG Committee took a conscious decision to
exclude the design and engineering charges. The EPCG Committee was convinced
that these charges do not relate to the goods under import. When the said
decision has been taken on the basis of facts, it is not for the
Jurisdictional Authorities, long after the import has been completed to say
that these charges should be included. It should also be borne in mind that
the EPCG Committee has one member representing the Customs Department. Before
proceeding against the appellants, the Jurisdictional Authorities should have
consulted with the CBEC. There is no record that they had done so. In the
facts and circumstances of the case, there is ample evidence to show that
design and engineering charges did not relate to the imported goods and the
EPCG Committee took this factor into account while excluding these charges
from the scope of EPCG licence. In this connection, the Circular No.
46/2004-Customs, dated 26.7.2004, issued by the CEBC is very relevant. The
same is reproduced below:
"3. In respect of Import of capital goods under EPCG Scheme, there is linkage
between the CIF value of imported capital goods and the quantum of export
obligation fixed against the EPCG Licence by DGFT authorities. Hence, if
Customs have any doubts about valuation of imported capital goods in relation
to addition of the element of any other charges in value then before
initiating any precipitative action, the Jurisdictional Commissioner of
Customs should bring this to the notice of Board which will take up the matter
with concerned DGFT authorities so that necessary corrective action, if any,
is taken simultaneously by Customs and DGFT. There is already a Committee set
up for this purpose in which CBEC is also represented. Role of representative
of CBEC in the EPCG Committee should be clearly understood and effectively
fulfilled. The aspect of classification and valuation (under the Customs Act
and Rules made thereunder) should be examined at the stage of issue of EPCG
licence by the representative of the CBEC attending EPCG Committee meetings.
Should there still be an incorrect CIF value on such a licence issued by the
DGFT and this gets subsequently noticed at the time of Import/assessment, then
this will be brought to the notice of the Member (Customs) & DGFT immediately
for suitable rectification. This is also because DGFT will have to
simultaneously increase the CIF value of the EPCG Licence and also the quantum
of export obligation specified therein. Unilateral action by Customs in such
cases may ultimately held the EPCG licence holder to escape the clutches of
law because under EPCG Scheme both Customs and DGFT authorities have important
roles to play.
4\. It is therefore reiterated that in all cases pertaining to EPCG Scheme
where Customs have doubts about valuation, quantum of EO etc., the
jurisdictional Commissioner of Customs scrupulously follow the instructions
contained in DOR Circular No. 24/2002."
In fact even in this Circular, Board has clarified the Circular No.
24/2002-Cus dated 6.5.2002 that normally redemption of Bond/BG filed under
EPCG Scheme by the licence holder shall be allowed by Customs on the basis of
E.O. Discharge Certificate issued by the DGFT authorities. However, in case of
doubts, Customs may refer the matter to the DGFT to take suitable corrective
action. In this case, if the Customs Department had entertained doubt in the
EPCG licence, they could have referred the matter to the DGFT. This is so,
because the EPCG licence is decided by a Committee consisting of
representatives from both the DGFT and the Customs Department. After the EPCG
licence is issued, if each department takes diametrically opposite views, the
trade or the assessee could be put to a great hardship. Anyhow on going
through the records, we find that the design/engineering charges did not
relate to the imported goods. There is no reason for including the same in the
CIF value of the goods imported. Moreover, the appellants have placed all the
facts before the EPCG Committee while getting the EPCG licence. They had also
placed all facts before the Customs Department at the time of clearance.
Hence, there is no evidence to show that the appellants had suppressed the
facts with a view to commit fraud to evade payment of duty. Hence, the longer
period for demanding duty cannot be invoked. As regards, the demand of Rs.
27,07,294 on account of shortfall in export obligation fulfilment, we cannot
uphold the Commissioner's findings. It is true that there was some delay in
fulfilling the export obligations within the date specified by the DGFT.
However, the appellants addressed the DGFT to extend the time and
consequently, the DGFT themselves accepted the export made after the
stipulated date. When the DGFT had issued the E.O. certificate by condoning
the delay, the Customs authorities cannot reject the condonation and demand
duty on the appellants. If this is allowed, this would make the entire system
of working of Government Departments a mockery. Therefore, we set aside the
demand of Rs. 27,07,294 on account of shortfall of the demand. Since the duty
demands have been set aside, the confiscation of impugned goods is also set
aside. There is absolutely no justification in imposition of fine and penalty.
In these circumstances, we allow the appeal with consequential relief.

(ii) The appellants placed an order on M/s Kerala State Electronics
Development Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'KELTRON') vide
letter of intent dated 31.10.1989 for the design, manufacture and supply of
electric controls instrumentation, automation and sublance system for the LD
converter in the steel melting shop known as SMS) for a total value of Rs.
1717.09 lakhs. A total amounts of Rs. 1717.09 lakhs was made up of the
following four components:
(a) Design and Engineering charges for goods covered under Groups I to IV.
