    CORAM:-
    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW
    1.
The plaintiff, a manufacturer of tyres and tubes for two wheelers and three
wheelers, instituted this suit i) for restraining the defendant no.2 MRF
Limited (MRF), also a manufacturer of tyres and tubes, from issuing groundless
threats to the plaintiff of the plaintiff in the advertisement of its products
advertisement was in the nature of mandatory injunction which only a Court
could issue and that ASCI could not usurp upon itself the jurisdiction of the
Court and CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 20 of 21 that the Complaint Procedure of
the ASCI could not be elevated to the status of arbitration proceedings. I
have hereinabove given my reasons for holding to the contrary and to that
extent, with respect, differ from the prima facie view taken by the Bombay
High Court.
22\. The plaintiff thus, by instituting this suit, cannot be permitted to
scuttle the proceedings on complaint of MRF before ASCI. Similarly the
plaintiff, by pursuing this suit cannot prevent its Advertising Agency and the
TV Channels and other medium on which the advertisement of the plaintiff is
airing from, if chose to abide by recommendation of ASCI with respect to said
advertisement, doing so. However in the event of ASCI finding merit in the
complaint and making a recommendation to the Authorised Officer, all remedies
available in law shall be open to the plaintiff.
23\. The suit of the plaintiff is premature and the plaintiff as of today has
threats to the plaintiff of the plaintiff in the advertisement of its products
having plagiarised/infringed the copyright of MRF in the advertisement of
MRF‟s products and liability therefor; ii) for restraining the defendant no.2
MRF from promoting unfair competition with reference to plaintiff in any
manner; iii) for declaration that such threats of institution of legal
proceedings contained in MRF‟s letter dated 18th October, 2016 are
unjustifiable and the plaintiff does not infringe or copy the advertisement of
MRF; iv) for restraining MRF from defaming the plaintiff in any oral or
written communication; v) for restraining the defendant no.1 Advertising
Standards Council of India (ASCI) from assessing or proceeding with the
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 1 of 21 complaint of MRF; vi) for recovery of
damages in the sum of Rs.1 crore from MRF on account of loss of reputation and
goodwill of the plaintiff owing to the illegal activities of the defendants.
2\. It was inter alia the case of the plaintiff in the suit titled "SUIT
SEEKING RESTRAINT OF GROUNDLESS THREATS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND DECLARATION
OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, DEFAMATION, DAMAGES ETC.":
> (i) that the plaintiff, in September, 2016, unveiled a new range of tyres
> for 150cc segment to 200-250cc segments and also high- end sports
> motorcycles;
> (ii) that the plaintiff, to promote its new product, got created
> advertisement from Prominent Advertising Services and the said advertisement
> appears on television, on the plaintiff‟s website as well as through online
> content providers such as YouTube;
> (iii) that on 25th October, 2016, the plaintiff was shocked to receive a
> letter dated 21st October, 2016 from ASCI forwarding therewith complaint
> dated 18th October, 2016 received from MRF against the TV commercial of
> plaintiff and inviting plaintiff‟s response thereto and informing the
> plaintiff that the complaint had been placed for deliberation before the
> Consumer Complaints Council of ASCI;
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 2 of 21
> (iv) that the MRF has complained that plaintiff‟s advertisement blatantly
> copied MRF‟s advertisement for its product REVZ Radial Tyres;
> (v) that the plaintiff has been wrongly accused of plagiarism /
> infringement;
> (vi) that the plaintiff sought extension of time from the ASCI for filing
> reply and denied any intent to plagiarise / infringe the copyright of MRF;
> (vii) that there is no visual similarity between plaintiff‟s advertisement
> and MRF‟s advertisement;
> (viii) that none can claim monopoly over the common underlying concept and
> idea;
> (ix) that ASCI does not have any authority to assess or even request the
> plaintiff to cease and desist from displaying the offending advertisement on
> national television;
> (x) that MRF‟s act of sending such false, frivolous and baseless complaint
> to ASCI whose Board comprises of reputed members of the media and other
> eminent persons in the corporate sector clearly evidences the intention of
> MRF to defame and harm the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff.
3\. The suit came up for admission on 7th November, 2016 when being not
convinced about the maintainability of the suit, the counsel for the CS(COMM)
No.1484/2016 Page 3 of 21 plaintiff was heard. After hearing the counsel for
the plaintiff further on 15 th November, 2016, the following order was passed:
> ―1. The counsel for the plaintiff has been heard further today.
> 2\. I am today also not satisfied about the maintainability of the present
> suit.
> 3\. The plaintiff has instituted this suit to restrain the defendant No.2
> MRF Limited from issuing groundless threats to the plaintiff of liability
> for infringement of copyright in the defendant No.2 MRF Limited's
> advertisement for its product REVZ and for restraining the defendant No.1
> Advertisement Standards Council of India (ASCI) from in any manner assessing
> or proceeding with the complaint filed by the defendant No.2 MRF Limited
> against the plaintiff and for ancillary reliefs.
> 4\. It is inter alia the case of the plaintiff that the defendant No.2 MRF
> Limited in its complaint to the defendant No.1 ASCI has accused the
> plaintiff of having plagiarised the advertisement of the defendant No.2 MRF
> Limited qua a same / similar product and of infringing the copyright of the
> defendant No.2 MRF Limited therein; that the defendant No.1 ASCI is not
> empowered to go into the question of infringement of copyright and passing
> off and the complaint of the defendant No.2 MRF Limited to the defendant
> No.1 ASCI amounts to a ―threat‖ within the meaning of Section 60 of the
> Copyright Act, 1957.
> 5\. I have enquired from the counsel for the plaintiff as to how there can
> be an injunction against the defendant No.2 MRF Limited from invoking legal
> proceedings. Sections 41(a) & 41(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is an
> absolute bar to the grant of permanent injunction to restrain another from
> invoking legal proceedings and Supreme Court in Cotton Corporation of India
> Limited Vs. United Industrial Bank Limited (1983) 4 SCC 625 has held that
> the grounds specified in Section 41(b) of the Specific Relief Act apply also
> to injunction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
> (CPC).
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 4 of 21
> 6\. The counsel for the plaintiff has argued that though the defendant No.2
> MRF Limited is a member of the defendant No.1 ASCI and the plaintiff is not.
> 7\. I am of the view that once an industrial body has been established, it
> is not open to a member of that industry to contend that it is not a member
> and not bound by the procedures and mechanism of that body. More so, when
> the Code for Self- Regulation in Advertising of the defendant No.1 ASCI has
> now been given the statutory flavour by Rule 7(9) of Cable Television
> Network Rules, 1994.
> 8\. As far as the contention of the counsel for the plaintiff, of the
> defendant No.1 ASCI being not authorised to go into the questions of
> infringement and passing off is concerned, it appears that the said pleas
> have to be raised by the plaintiff before the defendant No.1 ASCI and this
> Court cannot in this suit pre-empt the defendant No.1 ASCI from doing so. I
> have informed the counsel for the plaintiff that suits are coming before
> this Court against the decision finally taken by the ASCI and though a doubt
> has been raised as to the maintainability of the suit but as of now, the
> suits are being entertained and hearing going on, on the said aspect.
> 9\. The counsel for the plaintiff has sought to contend that the suit is
> under Section 60 of the Copyright Act.
> 10\. However, there is no plea to the said effect. Rather, in most of the
> plaints in suits under Section 60 of the Copyright Act which have come
> before me, it is found that the suit in the title thereof mentions it to be
> under Section 60 of the Copyright Act. The plaintiff herein has shied away
> from doing so.
> 11\. I have also drawn the attention of the counsel to the proviso to
> Section 60 of the Copyright Act and have enquired from him that once the
> defendant No.2 MRF Limited has already invoked the jurisdiction of the
> defendant No.1 ASCI, how can a suit under Section 60 of the Copyright Act
> would be maintainable.
> 12\. The counsel for the plaintiff has contended that since the defendant
> No.1 ASCI is not empowered to go into a question of infringement of
> copyright and only on institution of which action the CS(COMM) No.1484/2016
> Page 5 of 21 proviso to Section 60 of the Copyright Act applies, the said
> proviso would not be applicable.
> 13\. It is still to be decided whether the defendant No.1 ASCI is empowered
> to go into the said questions or not. I may at this stage only notice that
> Clause 4.2 of Chapter IV titled ‗Fair In Competition' of the Code for Self-
> Regulation in Advertising of ASCI provides that ―advertisements shall not
> make unjustifiable use of the name or initials of any other firm, company or
> institution, nor take unfair advantage of the goodwill attached to the
> trademark or symbol of another firm or its product or the goodwill acquired
> by its advertising campaign‖. Similarly, Clause 4.3 provides that
> ―advertisements shall not be similar to any other advertiser's earlier run
> advertisements in general layout, copy, slogans, visual presentations, music
> or sound effects, so as to suggest plagiarism‖.
> 14\. The counsel for the plaintiff then seeks adjournment to consider
> amending the plaint to challenge the Code aforesaid as well as Rule 7(9) of
> the Cable Television Network Rules.
> 15\. The counsel for the plaintiff while doing so, to also consider the
> interplay of Section 60 of the Copyright Act and Sections 41(a) & 41(b) of
> the Specific Relief Act which prohibit injunction against invocation of
> legal proceedings. It appears that there is conflict between the two. If
> that is so, how the same is to be resolved.
> 16\. List on 29th November, 2016.‖
4\. The plaintiff thereafter applied for amendment of plaint and which was
allowed on 29th November, 2016. The plaintiff in the amended plaint has
amended the title of the suit as under:
> "SUIT SEEKING RESTRAINT OF GROUNDLESS THREATS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDER
> SECTION 60 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT AND SECTION 142 OF THE TRADE MARKS ACT AND
> DECLARATION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, DEFAMATION, DAMAGES ETC."
and has added the pleas:
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 6 of 21
(i) that ASCI cannot consider the complaint of MRF as an action for
infringement and passing off as such an action would necessarily have to be
instituted in a Court of law in accordance with the provisions of the
Copyright Act, 1957 and Trade Marks Act, 1999;
(ii) that ASCI is not competent to decide any legal disputes;
(iii) that ASCI‟s Consumer Complaints Council if finds merit in the complaint
and the alleged offender does not voluntarily comply with the decision of the
Council, forwards the recommendation to the concerned Regulatory Authority or
government department for appropriate action;
(iv) that Rule 7(9) of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 (CTN Rules)
provides that any advertisement which violates ASCI‟s Code for Self-Regulation
in Advertising will not be carried on cable service;
(v) that Section 19 and Section 2(a) of the Cable Television Networks
(Regulations) Act, 1995 (CTN Act) make it clear that power to prohibit such
transmission of advertisements in violation of Advertisement Code vests with
an authorised officer who is either a District Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional
Magistrate, a Commissioner of Police or any other officer notified in the
Official Gazette by the Central or the State government;
(vi) that Rule 7(9) of the CTN Rules is in direct contravention of Section
62(1) of the Copyright Act whereunder determination of infringement of
copyright can only be made by a District Court as well as in contravention of
Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, which also CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 7 of
21 states that no suit for infringement and passing off of a trade mark shall
be instituted in any Court inferior to a District Court; thus no Authorised
Officer as defined in CTN Act can prohibit the transmission of any
advertisement on account of the fact that such advertisement may be
plagiarising or taking unfair advantage of the goodwill of any other persons‟
advertising campaign;
(v) that though MRF is a member of ASCI but the plaintiff is not;
(vi) that ASCI cannot decide a complaint of a member against a non-
member.
5\. The reliefs of i) injunction restraining the MRF from issuing groundless
threats to plaintiff with liability to causing confusion i.e passing off; ii)
a direction to ASCI to amend its Code for Self-Regulation; iii) revocation of
CTN Rules or amendment of Rule 7(9) thereof, have also been added in the
amended plaint.
6\. The counsel for the plaintiff was heard further on 20 th December, 2016
and order reserved.
7\. As far as the relief in the amended plaint, of impugning CTN Rules is
concerned, the said Rules being statutory in character, the challenge if any
thereto can, as per the Roster of this Court, be considered only by the
Division Bench. Therefore the suit claiming the said relief and which suit as
per Roster is to be considered by a Single Bench of this Court, cannot be
subject matter of this suit. Though Order XXVIIA of the CPC provides the
procedure to be followed in suits involving a substantial question of law as
to interpretation of the Constitution or as to validity of any Statutory
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 8 of 21 Instrument but by the suit court only and
the limitation of roster would remain. I therefore, need not go into the said
aspect and suffice it is to observe that the plaintiff would be at liberty to
claim the said relief in accordance with law. The said relief claimed in the
suit thus has to be rejected.
8\. That brings me to the crux of the dispute i.e. whether ASCI, in view of
jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes of passing off and infringement of
copyright having been vested in a Court not below the District Court, or for
any other reason, is not competent to deal with the complaint of MRF of the
plaintiff having plagiarised and infringed the copyright of MRF.
9\. ASCI was established in 1985 as a company under Section 25 of the
Companies Act, 1956 and with advertisers, media, advertising agencies and
other professional / ancillary services, industries connected with advertising
as its sponsors and with the purpose of „self-regulating the advertisements‟
and to ensure that the advertisements conform to the Code of self-regulation.
„The Code for self-regulation in Advertising‟ („The Code‟) of ASCI has been
drawn up by people in the profession and industries in or connected with
advertising, in consultation with representatives of people affected by
advertising and has been accepted by individuals, corporate bodies and
associations engaged in or otherwise concerned with the practice of
advertising. The Code drawn up by ASCI for self-regulation in advertising, in
Chapter IV thereof titled "Fair in Competition" in Clause 4.2 thereof provides
"advertisements shall not make unjustifiable use of the name or initials of
any other firm, company or institution, nor take unfair advantage of the
goodwill attached to the trademark or symbol of another firm or its CS(COMM)
No.1484/2016 Page 9 of 21 product or the goodwill acquired by its advertising
campaign" and in Clause 4.3 thereof provides "advertisements shall not be
similar to any other advertiser‟s earlier run advertisements in general
layout, copy, slogans, visual presentations, music or sound effects, so as to
suggest plagiarism"
10\. I have since, in Procter & Gamble Home Products Private Limited Vs.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd. 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7072, held that a) ASCI has been
established as a self regulatory body in the field of advertising and cannot
be said to have been established for dispute resolution or for resolution of
claims such as those made by the plaintiffs therein in the suits, of
disparagement, against the defendant; b) ASCI, though has a Complaints
Committee but only to „self regulate‟; c) The principles applicable to grant
of injunction contained in Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of CPC and in the Specific
Relief Act, 1963 though provide that injunctive relief shall not be granted
when equally efficacious alternative remedy is available but the remedy
available before ASCI cannot be said to be equally efficacious remedy; d)
ASCI, even if finds merit in complaint, can only recommend to the advertiser
to remove the advertisement but has no mechanism to compel removal of the
advertisement or to grant any interim relief or to award damages; e) Moreover,
membership of ASCI is not mandatory for all concerned; f) Reference was made
to Century Plyboards (India) Ltd. Vs. The Advertising Standards Council of
India MANU/MH/0030/2000 and Dish TV India Ltd. Vs. Advertising Standards
Council of India MANU/DE/3049/2016 holding that the rules and machinery of
ASCI are designed to complement legal controls, not to usurp or replace them;
g) The CTN Act enacted to regulate the operation of cable television networks
and CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 10 of 21 for matters connected therewith, in
Section 6 titled "Advertisement Code" prohibits transmitting or re-
transmitting through a cable service of any advertisement unless such
advertisement is in conformity with the prescribed Advertisement Code; h)
Section 11 of the CTN Act provides for seizure of the equipment of any cable
operator found violating inter alia Section 6 of the Act and Section 19 of the
CTN Act empowers the Government to prohibit the cable operator from
transmitting or re- transmitting any advertisement not in conformity with the
prescribed Advertisement Code; i) Section 22 of the CTN Act empowers the
Central Government to by notification in the Official Gazette make rules inter
alia for the Advertisement Code; j) The CTN Rules framed in exercise of said
power, under Rule 7 titled "Advertising Code", while providing that
advertisements carried in cable service shall be so designed as to conform to
the laws of the country and should not offend morality, decency and religious
susceptibilities of the subscribers, vide sub-rule (9) thereof provides that
no advertisement which violates The Code for self regulation in Advertising,
as adopted by the ASCI from time to time for public exhibition in India, shall
be carried in the cable service; k) However the said statutory flavour given
to the Code would also not bar the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, even after
ASCI has been approached and does not find any merit in the complaint, because
the remedy available before ASCI is distinct from that available before the
Civil Court; l) ASCI, even if finds any merit in the complaint with respect to
any advertisement, can only make a recommendation for rectification thereof
and if the recommendation remains un-complied, forward the same to the
Authorised Officer under the CTN Act CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 11 of 21 and
which officer is empowered to then prohibit the broadcast of the subject
advertisement; m) The said route though may be available, will not bar a
person aggrieved from the advertisements from approaching the Civil Court.
11\. Sections 62 of the Copyright Act as under:
> ―62. Jurisdiction of court over matters arising under this Chapter.--
> (1) Every suit or other civil proceeding arising under this Chapter in
> respect of the infringement of copyright in any work or the infringement of
> any other right conferred by this Act shall be instituted in the district
> court having jurisdiction.
(2) For the purpose of sub-section (1), a ―district court having jurisdiction‖
shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908, or any other law for the time being in force, include a district court
within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution
of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or other
proceeding or, where there are more than one such persons, any of them
actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works
for gain.‖ and Section 134 of the Trade Marks Act as under:
> ―134. Suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before District Court.--
> (1) No suit--
> (a) for the infringement of a registered trade mark; or
> (b) relating to any right in a registered trade mark; or
> (c) for passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade
> mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
> CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 12 of 21 trade mark, whether registered, or
> unregistered, shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court
> having jurisdiction to try the suit.
> (2) For the purpose of clauses (a) and (b) of sub- section (1), a ―District
> Court having jurisdiction‖ shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the
> Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or any other law for the time being in force,
> include a District Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at
> the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person
> instituting the suit or proceeding, or, where there are more than one such
> persons any of them, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business
> or personally works for gain.
Explanation. - For the purposes of sub-section(2), ―person‖ includes the
registered proprietor and the registered user.‖ on the basis whereof it is
contended that the ASCI would not have jurisdiction, only make a provision for
the suits for infringement and / or for proceedings under those Acts. The same
cannot be read as ousting the jurisdiction of any self-regulatory body as
ASCI. It is nobody‟s case that a complaint before ASCI is a suit. The
provisions aforesaid relating to suits cannot be made applicable to
proceedings which do not qualify as „suit‟ within the meaning of CPC. It may
be taken note of that both Copyright Act, vide Section 63 thereof and Trade
Marks Act, vide Section 103 thereof, also constitute infringement as an
offence and provide for prosecution thereof. Certainly it cannot be said that
such prosecutions are also governed by Sections 62 and 134 supra.
CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 13 of 21
12\. No merit is thus found in the contention of the counsel for the plaintiff
that ASCI, by virtue of Section 62 of the Copyright Act and/or Section 134 of
the Trade Marks Act is barred from entertaining the complaint as made by MRF
against the plaintiff before ASCI.
13\. Rather, I am of the view that such industry/sector specific self-
regulatory bodies should be encouraged. Functioning thereof curtails
litigation and allows an opportunity to constituents of the same
industry/sector to have their inter se disputes and differences settled
amicably. In fact long back Abraham Lincoln also observed "Discourage
litigation. Persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever you can". CPC was
also amended w.e.f. 1st July, 2002 inter alia by incorporating Section 89
therein providing for settlement of disputes outside the Court. The Courts
themselves have been encouraging settlement of disputes, not only by
arbitration, conciliation judicial settlement including settlement through Lok
Adalat, mediation after the parties have approached the Court but also prior
thereto by introducing pre-litigation mediation. Such spirit is also the basis
of enactment of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 Chapter VIA whereof
titled "Pre-litigation Conciliation and Settlement" in Section 22B thereunder
requires setting-up of Permanent Lok Adalats in respect of public utility
services viz. transport services, postal, telegraph and telephone services,
supply of power or light or water to the public by any establishment,
insurance services, service in hospital or dispensary etc. It is thus too late
in the day for the plaintiff to contend that the Court should strike down the
self regulatory mechanism evolved in the industry/sector of advertising.
Supreme Court, in Subramanian Swamy Vs. Union of India CS(COMM) No.1484/2016
Page 14 of 21 (2016) 7 SCC 221, in the context of constitutional fraternity
and fundamental duty observed that fraternity means brotherhood and common
interest; right to censure and criticise does not conflict with constitutional
objective to promote fraternity; brotherliness does not abrogate and rescind
the concept of criticism; in fact brothers can and should be critical-fault
finding and disagreement is required even when it leads to disquiet or
disquietude.
14\. The Division Bench of this Court in Indraprastha People Vs. Union of
India (2013) 200 DLT (CN) 25, in the context of CTN Act and CTN Rules, held
that under self-regulation the media voluntarily commits to uphold a code of
ethics that it itself drafts; it establishes a complaints mechanism to which
the public can complain about perceived breaches of the Code and an
independent council adjudicates on the complaints and enforces the code of
practice. It was held that compliance with the Code is voluntary and the media
does so out of a desire to secure the credibility of its profession and the
trust of the public. Self-regulation was held to be a combination of standards
setting out the appropriate code of behaviour for the media that are necessary
to support freedom of expression and process how those behaviours will be
monitored or held to account. The advantages and disadvantages of self-
regulation were expounded upon.
15\. A Division Bench of this Court of which the undersigned was a member
also, in Sai Lok Kalyan Sanstha Vs. Union of India (2014) SCC OnLine Del 7024,
dealing with a petition filed in public interest and flagging the issue of
broadcasting of a large number of programmes/advertisements on television
channels based on Astrology, „Lal Kitab‟, Tarot, Numerology, CS(COMM)
No.1484/2016 Page 15 of 21 „Devi Shakti aur Kripa‟, by so called self made
astrologers, „swamiji‟, „panditji‟, „guruji‟ and „babaji‟ who promise cures of
various ailments, held that since (i) CTN Act and the CTN Rules and the
programme code framed thereunder and Downlinking Guidelines empower the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to impose penalty inter alia of
suspension of the permission / registration granted thereunder and prohibit
broadcast up to a period of 30 days; (ii) there also exists a Broadcasting
Content Complaints Council (BCCC), a self-regulatory body of the television
broadcasters, the code of ASCI, also a voluntary self- regulatory council to
control the content of advertisements, provide a regulatory mechanism, the
petitioner therein must first approach the said foras before rushing to the
Court. I have as a member of the Division bench in Viacom 18 Media Private
Ltd. Vs. Union of India (2015) 216 DLT 222 also held against the petitioner
therein inter alia for the reason of taking the matter of self- regulation
very lightly. Supreme Court also in Destruction of Public and Private
Properties, in Re Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (2009) 5 SCC 212 accepted the
recommendations of the Nariman Committee of the need for self- regulation in
the media at the industry level and observed that the appropriate authorities
should take steps for implementation. Much has been said in the context of
self-regulation through in-house procedure, also for Advocates and Judges.
Reference may be made to C. Ravichandran Iyer Vs. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee
(1995) 5 SCC 457.
16\. Once ASCI has been constituted as a Self-Regulatory body for the purpose
of advertisements and the Code drafted and changed from time to time by ASCI
has been given a statutory flavour, I am unable to perceive CS(COMM)
No.1484/2016 Page 16 of 21 any other ground on which the plaintiff can
restrain ASCI from so functioning. Though the CTN Rules make the Code of ASCI
one of the criteria with which the advertisements should comply with and for
non- compliance wherewith the Authorised Officer under the CTN Act can be
approached and the Complaints Procedure devised by ASCI is not part of The
Code but I am of the view that once The Code devised by a Self- Regulatory
Body as ASCI has been conferred the statutory flavor, the opinion of such
Self-Regulatory Body, whether its Code has been violated or not, formed in
accordance with the procedure prescribed therefor shall certainly be a
relevant factor for the Authorised Officer to take a decision under the CTN
Act. The complaint procedure devised by ASCI for framing such opinion cannot
be said to be illegal or unlawful or contrary to any law.
17\. Section 60 of the Copyright Act, invoking which the suit has been filed,
as under:
> ―60. Remedy in the case of groundless threat of legal proceedings--Where any
> person claiming to be the owner of copyright in any work, by circulars,
> advertisements or otherwise, threatens any other person with any legal
> proceedings or liability in respect of an alleged infringement of the
> copyright, any person aggrieved thereby may, notwithstanding anything
> contained in section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (47 of 1963),
> institute a declaratory suit that the alleged infringement to which the
> threats related was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the
> person making such threats and may in any such suit--
> (a) obtain an injunction against the continuance of such threats; and
> CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 17 of 21
> (b) recover such damages, if any, as he has sustained by reason of such
> threats:
> Provided that this section does not apply if the person making such threats,
> with due diligence, commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of
> the copyright claimed by him.‖ allows a person, who though is threatened

18\. Though the plaintiff is not a member of ASCI but the plaintiff is
indulging in activity, viz. of advertising, qua which the defendant no.1 ASCI
has made a Code and for breach whereof ASCI entertains complaints. The
plaintiff also admits that the advertisement was got prepared from an
advertising agency and it is not the case of the plaintiff that the said
advertising agency is not a member of ASCI. Similarly, the said advertisement
is aired on media such as television and it is not the case of CS(COMM)
No.1484/2016 Page 18 of 21 the plaintiff that the television channels on which
its advertisement is aired are not members of ASCI. Thus, if ASCI makes a
recommendation and in pursuance thereto the advertising agency or the
television channel refuse to air the advertisement of the plaintiff, they
would be entitled to do so. No merit is thus found in the argument of the
counsel for the plaintiff of plaintiff being not a member of ASCI and ASCI
thus having no jurisdiction over the plaintiff.
19\. The Division Bench of this Court in Viacom 18 Media Private Ltd. supra
held that with the advent of technology enabling individual homes and other
establishments to, instead of via cable, directly download satellite
television channels, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of
India formulated policy Guidelines for Downlinking of all satellite television
channels downlinked / received / transmitted and re- transmitted in India for
public viewing; the same provide that no person / entity shall downlink a
channel, which has not been registered by the Ministry under the said
Guidelines; accordingly, all persons / entities providing Television Satellite
Broadcasting Services (TV Channels) uplinked from other countries to viewers
in India as well as any entity desirous of providing such a Television
Satellite Broadcasting Service (TV Channel), receivable in India for public
viewership, is required to obtain permission from the Ministry in accordance
with the said guidelines known as the Downlinking Guidelines; Clause 5 of the
said Guidelines prescribes basic conditions / obligations including of the
company permitted to downlink registered channels complying with the Programme
Code and empower the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting to impose penalty.
It CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 19 of 21 would thus be seen that compliance with
Programme Code/Advertisement Code is a condition for transmitting
programmes/advertisements through television channels.
20\. This Court in Star India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of India (2011) 185 DLT 519
held that there is tacit acknowledgement by the Information & Broadcasting
Ministry that the complaints received by it about objectionable content of
television programmes require to be examined by a broad-based expert body. It
was held that the suitability of the content concerns large cross-sections of
the society.
21\. The counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing relied on order dated
27th September, 2013 in CS(OS) No. 1877/2013 titled Quick Telemall Marketing
Pvt. Ltd. Vs. The Advertising Standards Council of India whereby a co-ordinate
Bench of this Court while issuing summons of the suit and granting ex parte
order staying the operation of the order of ASCI recommending suspension of
advertisement failing which it will be reported to the Authorised Officer,
prima facie observed that the directions of ASCI could not bind the non-
members. However not only are those observations prima facie but the reasoning
given hereinabove was not considered or adjudicated. The counsel for the
plaintiff also relied on Century Plyboards (India) Ltd. supra where also a
Single Judge of Bombay High Court expressed a prima facie view that directions
issued by ASCI adversely affecting the trade or profession of a non-member
would be without jurisdiction and that the direction of ASCI for suspension of
advertisement was in the nature of mandatory injunction which only a Court
could issue and that ASCI could not usurp upon itself the jurisdiction of the
Court and CS(COMM) No.1484/2016 Page 20 of 21 that the Complaint Procedure of
the ASCI could not be elevated to the status of arbitration proceedings. I
have hereinabove given my reasons for holding to the contrary and to that
extent, with respect, differ from the prima facie view taken by the Bombay
High Court.
22\. The plaintiff thus, by instituting this suit, cannot be permitted to
scuttle the proceedings on complaint of MRF before ASCI. Similarly the
plaintiff, by pursuing this suit cannot prevent its Advertising Agency and the
TV Channels and other medium on which the advertisement of the plaintiff is
airing from, if chose to abide by recommendation of ASCI with respect to said
advertisement, doing so. However in the event of ASCI finding merit in the
complaint and making a recommendation to the Authorised Officer, all remedies
available in law shall be open to the plaintiff.
23\. The suit of the plaintiff is premature and the plaintiff as of today has
no cause of action and the plaint is rejected.
No costs.
