PER BHAVNESH SAINI, J.M.
Both the appeals by the same assessee-company are directed against the
different orders of the Ld. CIT(A), Faridabad, dated 2nd August, 2016, for the
A.Ys. 2005-2006 and 2008-2009, dismissing both the appeals of the assessee-
company in limine holding them to be time barred.  2
ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad,
Haryana.
2\. Briefly, the facts of the case are that for A.Y. 2005- 2006, the A.O.
passed the assessment order on 27th November, 2007\. The A.O. considered the
issue of loss not allowable under section 94(7) of the I.T. Act in a sum of
Rs.8,59,897/-. The assessee-company himself calculated the same disallowance
and surrendered this amount, subject to no penalty. Similarly, in A.Y.
2008-2009, the A.O. passed the assessment order on 31st December, 2010 and
similarly, the assessee-company surrendered the amount of Rs.4,92,372/- under
section 94(7) of the I.T. Act, subject to no penalty. It is, therefore, clear
that the assessee-company on this addition agreed before the A.O. in both the
assessment years. The assessee-company did not file appeals before the Ld.
CIT(A) because it was an agreed addition. The assessee-company, later on, for
A.Y. 2005-2006, filed an appeal against the assessment order before the Ld.
CIT(A) on 22nd January, 2016 and for A.Y. 2008-2009 filed an appeal before the
Ld. CIT(A) on 06th April, 2015.  3
ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad,
Haryana. 2.1. The Ld. CIT(A), noted that both the appeals are delayed by more
than 08 years and 04 years respectively. The Ld. CIT(A) noted in the appellate
order that disallowance under section 94(7) was made vide assessment orders
dated 27.11.2007 and 31.12.2010, the A.O. levied the penalty vide order dated
30th May, 2008 for the A.Y. 2005-2006. The Ld. CIT(A) vide order dated 10th
July, 2009 deleted the penalty. The Tribunal vide order dated 11th June, 2010
reversed the order of the Ld. CIT(A) and upheld the penalty.
2.2. The assessee-company filed appeal before the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana
High Court which were dismissed vide order dated 29th March, 2011 and SLP of
the assessee- company has been dismissed on 10th October, 2011. For A.Y.
2008-2009, similarly, assessee-company filed rectification application under
section 154 which were rejected vide order dated 13th June, 2011. The Ld.
CIT(A) dismissed the appeal of assessee-company against 154 Order vide order
dated 11th June, 2016. The assessee-company withdraw the appeal from  4
ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad,
Haryana. the Tribunal. The appeal of assessee-company against penalty in this
year was pending before the Tribunal. 2.3. In the background of these facts,
Ld. CIT(A) noted that there is no sufficient cause for delay in filing the
appeals. The assessee-company contended before the Ld. CIT(A) that addition
has been wrongly made by the A.O. The Ld. CIT(A) however, did not accept the
contention of assessee-company and noted that there was sufficient
opportunities available to assessee-company to file appeal. The assessee-
company failed to prove any sufficient cause. Therefore, both the appeals were
dismissed in limine as the assessee-company has not been able to provide any
sufficient reason for delay in filing the appeals. Both the appeals were
accordingly dismissed holding them to be time barred.
3\. Learned Counsel for the Assessee contended that the entire delay has been
occurred due to ignorance of law by the Chartered Accountant. But, when
appeals were filed in 2016, Shri J.P. Gulati, Advocate, (who engaged in the
criminal  5 ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd.,
Faridabad, Haryana. proceedings in January, 2016), advised that the amount in
question is not taxable as business income. It is, therefore, submitted that
for substantial cause of justice, delay in filing both the appeals before the
Ld. CIT(A) may be condoned.
4\. The Ld. D.R. on the other hand, strongly relied upon the impugned orders
and submitted that there is no cause disclosed before the Ld. CIT(A) for
condonation of delay. Therefore, both the appeals have been correctly
dismissed.
5\. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the material
available on record. It is not in dispute that as regards disallowance under
section 94(7) of the I.T. Act in both the years, the assessee-company itself
calculated the disallowance and surrendered the amount in question, subject to
no penalty. Thus, the assessee-company agreed for both the additions, which
were not correctly challenged before the Ld. CIT(A). It is well settled law
that no appeal lies on agreed additions. We, rely upon the decision of Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in the case of Jivatlal Purtapshi vs. Commissioner of  6
ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad,
Haryana. Income Tax, Bombay, 65 ITR 261 (Bom.), Decision of Hon'ble Kerala
High Court in the case of CIT vs. Vamadevan Bhanu 330 ITR 559 (Kerala) and
Decision of Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of Banta Singh Kartar
Singh vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Patiala 125 ITR 239 (P & H). Since the
assessee- company agreed for these additions before A.O, therefore, there is
no question of filing any appeal before the Ld. CIT(A) and the assessee-
company correctly did not file any appeal before the Ld. CIT(A) on this issue.
The assessee-company after 08 and 04 years respectively, filed appeals before
the Ld. CIT(A) challenging both these additions without any justification and
basis. It was contended that the delay occurred due to ignorance of law by the
Chartered Accountant and later on, Shri J.P. Gulati, Advocate, advised the
assessee-company that such amount is not taxable. However, assessee-company
has failed to explain as to how the appeals of the assessee-company would be
maintainable when it has agreed for addition before the A.O. The explanation
of assessee-company is without substance and without basis. It has not
disclosed any sufficient cause for delay  7 ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s.
V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad, Haryana. in filing the appeals before
the Ld. CIT(A). 5.1. It would be appropriate to refer to some of the judicial
pronouncements on the issue of delay in filing the appeals. The Hon'ble
Calcutta High Court in the case of Hind Development Corporation vs. ITO (1979)
118 ITR 873 (Cal.), held that a Tribunal can condone the delay if there was
sufficient cause for the delay in the submission of the appeal. In the case of
Vedabai alias Vijayanatabai Baburao Patil v. Shantaram Baburao Patil (2002)
253 ITR 798 (SC), where it was held that while exercising discretion under
section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, to condone delay for sufficient cause
in not filing the appeal within the period prescribed, Courts should adopt a
pragmatic approach. A distinction must be made between a case where the delay
is inordinate and a case where the delay is of a few days. The Court observed
that whereas in the former consideration of prejudice to the other side will
be a relevant factor and calls for a more cautious approach. In the latter
case no such consideration may arise and such a case deserves a  8 ITA.No.5320
& 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad, Haryana. liberal
approach. Now in the present cases delay is not of a few days but of 08 years
and 04 years respectively. Besides, there is absolutely no valid
explanation/reason for the delay. In the case of CIT v. Ram Mohan Kabra (2002)
257 ITR 773, the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court has observed that where
the Legislature spells out a period of limitation and provides for power to
condone the delay as well, such delay can only be condoned only for sufficient
and good reasons supported by cogent and proper evidence. It is a settled
principle of law that provisions relating to the specified period of
limitation must be applied with their rigor and effective consequences. In
this case, delay for filing the appeal late for only a few days was not
condoned. In the case of ACIT vs. Taggas Industries Development Ltd. (2002) 80
ITD 21 (Tribu.) (Cal.), the Calcutta Bench of the Tribunal, did not condone
the delay for filing the appeal late by 13 days because the delay was not due
to sufficient cause. Thus, relying on the above judgments, we hold that
assessee failed to explain before the Ld. CIT(A) that delay in filing the
appeals was due to sufficient cause. Therefore, the  9 ITA.No.5320 &
5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad, Haryana. Ld.
CIT(A), rightly dismissed the appeals of the assessee- company on this ground.
5.2. In the present cases, there is an inordinate delay in filing the appeals
before the Ld. CIT(A) without justification and as such, prejudice have been
caused to the Revenue Department. Further, no sufficient cause have been
disclosed in the explanation of assessee-company. Therefore, the Ld. CIT(A),
correctly dismissed the appeals of the assessee- company by holding them to be
time barred. No interference is called for in the matter. Both the appeals of
the assessee- company are dismissed.
6\. In the result, both the appeals of the assessee- company are dismissed.

PER BHAVNESH SAINI, J.M.
Both the appeals by the same assessee-company are directed against the
different orders of the Ld. CIT(A), Faridabad, dated 2nd August, 2016, for the
A.Ys. 2005-2006 and 2008-2009, dismissing both the appeals of the assessee-
company in limine holding them to be time barred.  2

2\. Briefly, the facts of the case are that for A.Y. 2005- 2006, the A.O.
passed the assessment order on 27th November, 2007\. The A.O. considered the
issue of loss not allowable under section 94(7) of the I.T. Act in a sum of
Rs.8,59,897/-. The assessee-company himself calculated the same disallowance
and surrendered this amount, subject to no penalty. Similarly, in A.Y.
2008-2009, the A.O. passed the assessment order on 31st December, 2010 and
similarly, the assessee-company surrendered the amount of Rs.4,92,372/- under
section 94(7) of the I.T. Act, subject to no penalty. It is, therefore, clear
that the assessee-company on this addition agreed before the A.O. in both the
assessment years. The assessee-company did not file appeals before the Ld.
CIT(A) because it was an agreed addition. The assessee-company, later on, for
A.Y. 2005-2006, filed an appeal against the assessment order before the Ld.
CIT(A) on 22nd January, 2016 and for A.Y. 2008-2009 filed an appeal before the
Ld. CIT(A) on 06th April, 2015.  3
ITA.No.5320 & 5321/Del./2016 M/s. V.S.B. Investments P. Ltd., Faridabad,
Haryana. 2.1. The Ld. CIT(A), noted that both the appeals are delayed by more
time barred. No interference is called for in the matter. Both the appeals of
the assessee- company are dismissed.
6\. In the result, both the appeals of the assessee- company are dismissed.
Order pronounced in the open Court.
