phonetic sound. In the instant case, the mark over which both appellant and
respondents want to lay a claim is exactly the same mark. It is the case of
the appellant that it is the prior user and continued to use the same even
after getting registration into a company. The said fact has been admitted by
respondent No.2 as DW-1 in his cross-examination. The trial court has erred in
declining to grant relief in favour of the plaintiff only on the ground that
only on and from the date of registration, one can lay a claim over a `mark'.
The said view, and the view that the mark used by an unregistered organization
would not enure to the very unregistered organization after its registration
unless there is a resolution or deed transferring such a reputation and
goodwill of the unorganised group, are contrary to the law on the point in the
above two decisions referred to.
17\. In the circumstances, I am of the view that judgment and decree passed by
the trial court suffer from irregularity and  16 illegality as pointed above
and liable to be set aside and consequently the suit of the appellant is
entitled to be decreed.

    AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND DECREE DATED 19.01.2012
    PASSED IN O.S.NO.8773/2006 ON THE FILE OF XVIII
    ADDITIONAL CITY CIVIL JUDGE, BANGALORE, DISMISSING THE
    SUIT FILED FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION.
         THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF
    JUDGMENT THIS DAY AFTER HAVING HEARD AND RESERVED
    FOR JUDGMENT ON 26.02.2018, THE COURT DELIVERED THE
    FOLLOWING:
                               JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed by the plaintiff in O S No.8773/2006 on the file of XVIII
Additional City Civil Judge (CCH No.10), Bengaluru City being aggrieved of the
judgment and decree dated 19.01.2012 dismissing the suit. The suit was for the
relief of permanent injunction.
2\. The brief facts of the case are as follows: The Appellant is a Company
incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. Prior to its
incorporation the Appellant was an association of persons, carrying out  3
activities for promoting software - related test experiences by bringing
together software test professionals, practitioners, experts, academicians,
and service/product vendors to share techniques, methodologies, frameworks,
experiences, and case studies to perform, manage and automate software
testing. Its Organising Committee comprised some of the leading names in the
Software and Information Technology sector.
3\. Earlier, the Appellant organisation had the Respondent No.2, Mr. Arunkumar
Khannur, as one of its founding members. He was also the Managing Director of
a Company known as Quality Solutions for Information Technology Pvt. Ltd. for
short, `QSIT'.
4\. However, in October 2005, the Respondent No.2 resigned from QSIT and
immediately thereafter on 23.11.2005, he resigned from the Appellant's
organisation.
5\. Subsequent thereto, the Respondent No.2 incorporated a company with the
name and business deceptively similar/identical to the QSIT and faced
appropriate legal  4 proceedings under the Companies Act and before other
forums such as the Civil Court in respect thereof. The suit bearing OS No.
9531/2005 filed against the Respondent No.2 by QSIT was decreed by the City
Civil Court, restraining him from carrying on business deceptively
similar/identical to that of QSIT.
6\. Despite his resignation and being fully aware of the existence of the
Appellant, the Respondent No.2 along with other persons, applied for
registration of the Respondent No.1 as a society within the meaning of the
Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. The Respondent No.1 herein, by
misleading the concerned authorities, came to be registered on 27.12.2005 as a
society. Soon thereafter, the Respondent No.1 started issuing mischievous
mails/notices/communications to various members, associates and well-wishers
of the Appellant for alleged programmes being organized by it. The Respondents
also mischievously registered a website www.stepinforum.in on 12.01.2006
despite the fact that the Appellant had a pre- existing website under the name
www.stepinforum.org as far back as 19.02.2005.
5
7\. Aggrieved by the actions of the Respondents, and in order to protect its
trade name and trade mark 'STeP - IN Forum', the Appellant herein filed OS
No.8773/2006 against the Respondents inter alia seeking to restrain them from
using the Appellant's mark 'STeP -IN Forum' in any manner whatsoever.
8\. The respondents filed written statement, inter alia contending that the
appellant obtained registration on 3.5.2006, whereas the first respondent
organization has been duly registered under the Karnataka Societies
Registration Act, 1960 with effect from 27.12.2005. The respondents are prior
users of the name and the appellant has no locus standi to seek permanent
injunction. The prior incorporation of appellant company on non profitable
basis since October, 2003 was denied. The organization by name STEP-IN-FORUM
was conceived by 2nd respondent along with Srinivasan Desikan during October,
2003. Pursuant to resignation of members of organizing committee on
24.11.2005, the organization when was not registered, the mark STEP-IN-FORUM
does not belong to any  6 one. The allegation that the defendants are passing
off services as that of the appellant's trade mark was denied.
9\. Based on the pleadings of the parties, the trial court framed the relevant
issues consisting of prior user of the mark, plaintiff proving passing off by
the 2nd defendant or defendants proving plaintiff's passing off. The trial
court answered all the issues in the negative except the issue relating to
plaintiff proving 2nd defendant involving in passing off, which was the second
issue. The 2nd issue was answered as it did not arise. Thus the court below
dismissed the suit.
10\. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The learned counsel for
the appellant submitted that plaintiff was an unregistered association since
2003 and prior user of mark `Step In' and after its registration as a company,
the company derived reputation and the goodwill. The criteria being prior
user, similarity of the mark and similarity of the phonetic sound and
registration of the mark or similar mark in point of time being irrelevant for
an action on passing off, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Heinz Italia & another  7 v. Dabur India Ltd., reported in (2007) 6 SCC 1,
Para-15, the very basis on which the trial court dismissed the suit, is
erroneous. The trial court concentrated more on registration and without such
a registration, nothing flows from it and person cannot claim any advantage
over the later registered user of the mark. The respondent No.2 had himself
admitted in Para-3 of the cross-examination that appellant may have continued
to function even after November, 2005 and the appellant may be in existence
even now. The prior user of the mark thus having established, the court below
was in error in dismissing the suit. Though Memorandum of Association has been
marked as Ex.P25, the court below observed that the same has not been
produced, which is non-application of mind. Thus he prayed for allowing the
appeal and to decree the suit.
11\. The learned counsel for the respondents supported the judgment and decree
passed by the trial court.
12\. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, the only point that
arises for consideration is; whether the judgment and decree passed by the
court below suffers from irregularity  8 and illegality calling for
interference by this Court? My finding would be in the affirmative for the
following reasons.
13\. As the facts emerge from the pleadings of the parties, the plaintiff
before it was registered as a Company on 3.5.2006, was an association of
persons, of course one of such person was the 2nd respondent. The plaintiff
has been operating with the same name even prior and after its registration as
a company. This has been admitted by Respondent No.2 in his cross- examination
as DW-1 on 14.07.2009. DW-2 has admitted that appellant may have continued to
function even after November, 2005 and the appellant may be in existence even
now. It is a fact that respondent No.2 resigned from the plaintiff
organization on 23.11.2005 and got registered the first respondent
organization under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act 1960 with effect
from 27.12.2005. The Trial court on the basis that the first respondent is a
prior registered organization, declined the relief in favour of the appellant.
14\. The trial court held that earlier the plaintiff was a group of nine
members, which was an unregistered entity. The  9 trial court further held
that there could not have been any reputation or goodwill to an organization
which was unregistered. The plaintiff after formation of new company could not
have derived reputation of an unregistered organization to the company formed
later on. An unregistered organization, group could not have any reputation of
its own, and it could not have assigned any reputation to the plaintiff. The
plaintiff's claim that reputation of unregistered group has fallen to newly
established company of him, he is required to show that members of erstwhile
unregistered group by resolution or by deed have transferred reputation and
goodwill of the unorganised group. It is not his case. Therefore, the e-mails
sent and received as per Ex.P7 to 12 will not prove that they were being
passed off by 2nd defendant. When the members dissolved the unregistered
group, the reputation of their respective companies will begin from the date
of starting of their new companies. It will not go back to the date of
formation of unorganized group.
10
15\. The above view entertained by the trial court is quite contrary to the
law on the point of reputation and goodwill of an unregistered organization
and such reputation and goodwill enuring to the benefit of organization being
registered later on and action on passing off. It is beneficial to extract
Paragraphs No.9 & 10 from judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in C.I.T.
Bangalore v. B C Srinviasa Setty, reported in (1981) 2 SCC 460 on reputation
and goodwill and Para-15 from judgment in Heinz Italia & another v. Babu India
Ltd., reported in (2007) 6 SCC 1 relating to action on passing off, which are
as follows:
> "9. Goodwill denotes the benefit arising from connection and reputation. The
> original definition by Lord Eldon in Cruttwell v. Lye that goodwill was
> nothing more than "the probability that the old customers would resort to
> the old places" was expanded by Wood V.C. in Churton v. Douglas to encompass
> every positive advantage "that has been acquired by the old firm in carrying
> on its business, whether connected with the premises in which the business
> was previously carried on or with the name of the old firm, or with any
> other matter carrying with it the benefit of the business". In Trego v. Hunt
> Lord Herschell described goodwill as a connection which tended to become
> permanent because of habit or  11 otherwise. The benefit to the business
> varies with the nature of the business and also from one business to
> another. No business commenced for the first time possesses goodwill from
> the start. It is generated as the business is carried on and may be
> augmented with the passage of time. Lawson in his "Introduction to the Law
> of Property" describes it as property of a highly peculiar kind. In
> Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal III v. Chunilal Prabhudas & Co., the
> Calcutta High Court reviewed the different approaches to the concept:
> "It has been horticulturally and botanically viewed as "a seed sprouting" or
> an "acorn growing into the mighty oak of goodwill". It has been
> geographically described by locality. It has been historically described by
> locality. It has been historically explained as growing and crystalising
> traditions in the business. It has been described in terms of a magnet as
> the "attracting force". In terms of comparative dynamics, goodwill has been
> described as the "differential return of profit". Philosophically it has
> been held to be intangible. Though immaterial, it is materially valued.
> Physically and psychologically, it is a "habit" and sociologically it is a
> "custom".
> Biologically, it has been described as Lord Macnaghten in Trego v. Hunt as
> the  12 "sap and life" of the business.
> Architecturally, it has been described as the "cement" binding together the
> business and its assets as a whole and a going and developing concern."
A variety of elements goes into its making, and its composition varies in
different trades and in different businesses in the same trade, and while one
element may preponderate in one business, another may dominate in another
business. And yet because of its intangible nature, it remains insubstantial
in form and nebulous in character. Those features prompted Lord Macnaghten to
remark in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Muller & Co.'s Margarine Limited
that although goodwill was easy to describe, it was nonetheless difficult to
define. In a progressing business goodwill tends to show progressive increase.
And in a failing business it may begin to wane. Its value may fluctuate from
one moment to another depending on changes in the reputation of the business.
It is affected by everything relating to the business, the personality and
business rectitude of the owners, the nature and character of the business,
its name and reputation, its location, its impact on the contemporary market,
the prevailing socio economic ecology, introduction to old customers and
agreed absence of competition. There can be no account in value of the factors
producing it. It u also impossible to predicate the moment of its birth. It
13 comes silently into the world, unheralded and unproclaimed and its impact
may not be visibly felt for an undefined period. Imperceptible at birth it
exists enwrapped in a concept, growing or fluctuating with the numerous
imponderables pouring into, and affecting, the business. Undoubtedly, it is an
asset of the business, but is it an asset contemplated by s. 45?
(2007) 6 SCC 1:
"15. We have also considered the arguments with regard to the prior user of
the trade mark "Glocon-D" and the specific packaging. It is the admitted case
that the term "Glucose-D" has been used by the respondent from the year 1989
and that the packaging which is the subject matter of dispute in the present
suit has been in use from the year 2000. In century Traders, it has been held
that in an action for passing off, the plaintiff has to establish prior user
to secure an injunction and that the registration of the mark or similar mark
in point of time, is irrelevant. This Court in Cadila Health Care case also
laid down the tests in the case of passing off and observed as under:
14
"In other words in the case of unregistered trade marks, a passing-off action
is maintainable. The passing-off action depends upon the principle that nobody
has a right to represent his goods as the goods of somebody. In other words a
man is not to sell his goods or services under the pretence that they are
those of another person. As per Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink BV v. J.
Townend & Sons, the modern tort of passing off has five elements i.e. (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to
prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services
supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of
another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable
consequence), and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of
the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will
probably do so."
15
16\. Therefore, the essential criteria to be seen in an action for passing
off, is prior user of the mark, similarity of the mark and similarity of
phonetic sound. In the instant case, the mark over which both appellant and
respondents want to lay a claim is exactly the same mark. It is the case of
the appellant that it is the prior user and continued to use the same even
after getting registration into a company. The said fact has been admitted by
respondent No.2 as DW-1 in his cross-examination. The trial court has erred in
declining to grant relief in favour of the plaintiff only on the ground that
only on and from the date of registration, one can lay a claim over a `mark'.
The said view, and the view that the mark used by an unregistered organization
would not enure to the very unregistered organization after its registration
unless there is a resolution or deed transferring such a reputation and
goodwill of the unorganised group, are contrary to the law on the point in the
above two decisions referred to.
17\. In the circumstances, I am of the view that judgment and decree passed by
the trial court suffer from irregularity and  16 illegality as pointed above
and liable to be set aside and consequently the suit of the appellant is
entitled to be decreed.
Accordingly, appeal is allowed. The suit of the appellant is decreed as prayed
for. The parties to bear their own costs.

         THIS RFA IS FILED U/S 96 R/W ORDER 41 OF CPC,
    AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND DECREE DATED 19.01.2012
    PASSED IN O.S.NO.8773/2006 ON THE FILE OF XVIII
    ADDITIONAL CITY CIVIL JUDGE, BANGALORE, DISMISSING THE
    SUIT FILED FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION.
         THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF
    JUDGMENT THIS DAY AFTER HAVING HEARD AND RESERVED
    FOR JUDGMENT ON 26.02.2018, THE COURT DELIVERED THE
    FOLLOWING:
                               JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed by the plaintiff in O S No.8773/2006 on the file of XVIII
Additional City Civil Judge (CCH No.10), Bengaluru City being aggrieved of the
phonetic sound. In the instant case, the mark over which both appellant and
respondents want to lay a claim is exactly the same mark. It is the case of
the appellant that it is the prior user and continued to use the same even
after getting registration into a company. The said fact has been admitted by
respondent No.2 as DW-1 in his cross-examination. The trial court has erred in
declining to grant relief in favour of the plaintiff only on the ground that
only on and from the date of registration, one can lay a claim over a `mark'.
The said view, and the view that the mark used by an unregistered organization
would not enure to the very unregistered organization after its registration
unless there is a resolution or deed transferring such a reputation and
goodwill of the unorganised group, are contrary to the law on the point in the
above two decisions referred to.
17\. In the circumstances, I am of the view that judgment and decree passed by
the trial court suffer from irregularity and  16 illegality as pointed above
and liable to be set aside and consequently the suit of the appellant is
entitled to be decreed.
