24\. Therefore, the accused is guilty for the offences U/s 63 & 68A of
Copyright Act, 1957. It is also proved that accused was possessing blue films
VCDs which were containing obscene video clippings and that those VCDs were
displayed in a shop, they were meant for sale/letting/hire and nothing else
and thereby the accused committed the offence u/s 292 IPC and accused is

(i) Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:-
> 1\. Sole accused was sent up for trial in this case for the offences u/s 63
> and 68-A of The Copyright Act, 1957 and section 292 of IPC.
2\. Brief facts of the case are that in a complaint dated 25-10-2001 given by
Sh. Hassan Naved, on behalf of M/s Malhotra Copyright Protection Agency (MCPA
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 1 of 13/DK for short), it is alleged that Motion
Picture Association (MPA for short) is authorized by various motion picture
companies to take action against infringement of their copyright and, MPA in
turn authorized MCPA for taking such action. The complainant alleged that some
unknown persons were indulged in infringement. On the said complaint, on
27-10-2001 a raiding party comprising of complainant Naved Hassan, Inspector
N. K. Sharma, SI J. S. Misra, SI Sunder Pal, Ct. Rohtash, Ct. Ram Kewal, Ct.
Naresh, Ct. Bijender and SI Manoj Kumar was organized and, the raiding party
reached at Lajpat Rai Market at about 4:50 pm. It is the case of prosecution
that at Lajpat Rai Market, an information was received from an already
deployed informer that, accused Mohinder Pal was indulged in infringement at
shop no. 479, Lajpat Rai Market, Delhi. The shop was raided and from it, 467
infringed VCDs of various Hindi movies such as Indian, Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai,
Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dil Chahta Hai, Lagaan, Gadar, Independence Day, Broken
Arrow, Speed, Mummy Returns etc., which were displayed for sale in the
showcase were recovered. Besides this 268 VCDs of blue films (containing
obscene video clippings) were also recovered. Thereafter, the present case was
got registered and accused was arrested. It is the claim of the investigating
agency that recovered articles were also not containing mandatory particulars
as required u/s 52-A of Copyright Act, 1957.
3\. Accordingly, charges u/s 63 and 68-A of The Copyright Act, 1957 and, under
section 292 IPC were framed against the accused to which he claimed trial.
4\. In support of its case, prosecution examined five witnesses, namely, PW-1
Chandra Nayak, PW-2 HC Rohtash Kumar, PW--3 Mohd Hassan Naved, PW--4 Satya
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 2 of 13/DK Narain and PW--5 SI Manoj Kumar.
5\. PW-1 HC Chandra Nayak was the Duty officer who proved FIR and is a formal
witness.
6\. PW-4 Satya Narain did not support the case of prosecution and he turned
hostile. Prosecution cited this witness to prove the fact that the shop in
question, from which recovery was effected, belonged to this witness and it
was given on rent to the accused. But this witness PW-4 deposed that he had no
shop in his own name in the said market and his daughter Shweta had one shop
no. 373 and not
479\. He deposed that he never let out any shop to the accused. He even
specifically stated that he does not know anything about this case. Neither
his statement was recorded by the police, nor police ever met him. He even
deposed that he even does not know the accused. Despite cross-examination of
this witness by learned prosecutor for the state, nothing material could be
brought on record in favour the prosecution.
7\. Besides the above two formal witnesses, the prosecution also examined
three witnesses of to prove recovery namely PW-2 HC Rohtash Kumar, PW-3 Mohd
Hassan Naved and, PW--5 SI Manoj Kumar. All of them deposed that on the day in
question on receipt of complaint from PW-3, a raiding party comprising all
three of them, under the supervision of Inspector N K Sharma, and consisting
of SI J S Misra, SI Sunder Pal, Ct. Ram Kewal, Ct. Naresh, Ct. Bijender was
constituted. The raiding party reached Lajpat Rai Market and from the shop of
accused total 467 infringed VCD of various Hindi/English movies and 268 VCDs
of blue films were JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A
CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 3 of 13/DK recovered. After the
recovery of case property, it was sealed with the seal of IO and it was taken
into police possession vide memo Ex. PW--3/D. Thereafter, a rukka was prepared
and case was got registered and thereafter accused was arrested. They
categorically deposed that accused was physically present there. All these
three witnesses also identified the accused in the court as the person who was
arrested. The witnesses PW--3 and PW--5 also identified the case property in
the court as Ex. P1 and P2. It is also deposed by PW-3 Mohd Hassan Naved that
mandatory particulars as required u/s 52-A Copyright Act, 1957 were not
displayed on the case property. PW-3 also proved his complaint as Ex. PW-3/A
and PW-5 proved the rukka, site plan, arrest memo and personal search memos of
the accused as Ex. PW-5/A, B, PW-3/F and PW-3/F respectively.
All these three witnesses were subjected to cross-examination by the accused
at length but despite cross-examination of these three witnesses by the
accused, nothing material could be brought out on record in order to impeach
the creditworthiness or trustworthiness of the witnesses.
8\. Entire incriminating evidence against the accused was put to him in his
statement u/s 313 Cr. P. C. to which accused generally denied and stated that
he has been implicated falsely. The accused did not opt to lead any defence
evidence in his favour.
9\. I have heard Ld. APP for State and learned counsel Sh. S C Arora. for
accused. Ld. Counsel for accused Sh S C Arora has argued and pointed out that
there are various contradictions in the testimony of the three recovery
witnesses regarding date of recovery, vehicle through which the raiding party
traveled to JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act &
292 IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 4 of 13/DK Lajpat Rai Market, from where the
gunny bags etc. were brought for sealing the case property, exact time when
rukka was sent, the time when Constable returned after FIR, the time of
reaching the spot and the time when raiding party finally left the spot. On
the basis of these arguments, it is claimed that these contradictions prove
that this case is false. Much emphasis is laid on the point that PW-2 HC
Rohtash Kumar told the date of recovery as 22/10/2001 and not 27/10/2001. Much
emphasis is also laid on the point that witnesses have given different
descriptions of the vehicles through which the police party traveled to the
place of recovery and as to how many story building the place of recovery was
and, also as to how many exact number of public persons were requested to
become witness. It is claimed that PW-2 HC Rohtas Kumar stated that 10/15
persons were so requested whereas other witnesses have given different
numbers. It is also argued that memos etc. were prepared in the Police station
and all these things show that case is false.
10\. I am afraid none of the arguments raised by the counsel for accused are
good enough to create any reasonable doubt about the case of the prosecution.
Minor variations in observations by the witnesses regarding the number of
story of the building, regarding descriptions of vehicles and the time of
leaving of spot, reaching the spot, sending the rukka and leaving the spot
finally etc., are nothing but simple error of observations and lapse of
memory. When witnesses are examined in the court after a long gap of recovery,
such minor contradictions are bound to occur and cannot, and should not be
given any undue weightage. It may be mentioned that PW-2 and PW-3 were
examined in the court on 28-07-2003 and thereafter, on PW-5 was examined in
the court in the year 2005 and after so JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR
NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292 IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 5 of 13/DK many
years of recovery, such minor variations and contradictions are bound to
occur. Otherwise, the testimony of all these three recovery witnesses are
corroborating each other in all necessary particulars. All three of them have
categorically identified the accused as the person from whose possession
infringed articles were recovered. Although the prosecution could not prove
that accused had obtained the shop on tenancy from PW-4, as he turned hostile
but that does not affect the decision of the case for the simple reason that
in the present case the dispute is not regarding occupancy or ownership of the
property but the question is regarding infringement and possessing obscene
material which were meant for sale/letting/hire. Things might have been
different if PW-4 had stated that he was owner of thee shop no 479, and that
no such raid was conducted or that the accused never occupied the shop. But
here is a case where PW-4 has stated that he is not owner of any shop in the
said market including shop no. 479 although some other shop is owned by his
daughter. Things could also have been different had the accused examined in
his favour the owner of said shop no. 479 to prove that no such raid was
conducted or that accused never occupied the same. The fact that accused was
physically present at the shop from where recovery was effected and, at that
shop the above articles were displayed for sale is categorically deposed by
prosecution witnesses. It is pertinent to note that PW-3 Mohd Hassan Naved is
a public person even though an employee of the complainant company and there
is no reason for him to implicate the accused falsely. Although the accused
claimed that he has been implicated falsely but not even a single suggestion
is put forth by the accused in the cross-examination of any of the witnesses,
suggesting as to what could have been the possible motive for those witnesses
to have falsely implicated the accused. No such reason is JUDGMENT/State Vs.
Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 6 of 13/DK even put forth by the accused in his
statement. It is highly unlikely that prosecution witnesses would, for no
rhyme or reason, implicate the accused. They have no reason to do so. For that
matter, neither PW-3 Mohd. Hassan Naved nor any other police official gains
anything by implicating the accused and therefore I do not see any reason to
suspect the genuineness of the case of prosecution.
11\. The next contention raised is that there is no decoy customer sent to the
shop or that there was no customer present in the shop therefore there is no
material with the prosecution that articles were meant for sale, is also
without any force. Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957 defines as to what is
infringement and when copyright is deemed to be infringed. It provides that
copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed when any person makes for
sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade displays or offers
for sale or hire any infringing copies of the work. Therefore under clause (b)
of section 51 of Copyright Act, 1957, mere making of , and mere displaying by
way of trade or offering for sale or hiring infringing copies is deemed to be
infringement. In the present case, it is specifically deposed by the
prosecution witnesses that infringed VCDs were kept in shop and displayed for
sale. Even otherwise, there is no justification by the accused regarding
possession of such huge quantity of VCDs of various movies. The accused was
running a VCDs shop and thus these articles were meant for sale in the shop
and nothing else. Recovery of such huge quantity of these articles gives rise
to a legitimate presumption that it were meant for sale/ hire and nothing
else. Therefore there is deemed infringement u/s 51 of the Act.
12\. It is next argued by learned counsel for the accused that there are no
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 7 of 13/DK independent witness joined by the
investigating agency. PW-3 is a public person and he's not a police official.
There is no reason for PW 3 to falsely implicate the accused in the present
case. Even there is no reason for the other police officials to falsely depose
against the accused or implicate the accused. The case of prostitution is that
few independent witnesses were indeed requested to become witness but they did
not agree. It is not uncommon these days that people are reluctant to become
witness in criminal trial cases. In such circumstances no benefit can be given
to the accused for not joining off independent public witnesses. It is a
matter of common knowledge that public persons are reluctant to become
witnesses of criminal trial. It has been held in a number of judgments by
Hon'ble Supreme court and High Courts that merely because public witnesses are
not joined in a case, prosecution case cannot be thrown out.
13\. It is next argued that other recovery witnesses were not examined in this
case and that PW 3 Hasan Naved is an interested witness being representative
of IMI. This arguments is also without force as it is not the quantity of
evidence which matters in a criminal case but it is the quality of evidence
which matters. What is to be seen is whether the witness examined by
prosecution were trustworthy and the number of witnesses are not to be
counted. Section 134 of the Indian Evidence Act clearly provides that no
particular number of witnesses in any case be required for the proof of any
fact. Thus a conviction can be based on solitary witness which is trust worthy
and what matters is quality of evidence and not quantity.
In AIR 2005 SUPREME COURT 2503 Seeman alias Veeranam, Vs. State by Inspector
of Police, It was observed in Para 4 that it is now well settled that
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 8 of 13/DK the evidence of witness cannot be
discarded merely on the ground that he is a related witness or the sole
witness, or both, if otherwise the same is found credible. The witness could
be a relative but that does not mean to reject his statement in totality. If
on scrutiny it is found that the evidence on record of such interested sole
witness is worth credence, the same would not be discarded merely on the
ground that the witness is an interested witness. It is well settled that it
is the quality of the evidence and not the quantity of the evidence which is
required to be judged by the court to place credence on the statement.
Similarly in the case of State of U.P. vs. Anil Singh AIR 1988 SC 1998 it was
held that in some cases the entire prosecution case is doubted for not
examining all witnesses to the occurrence. We have recently pointed out to the
indifferent attitude of the public in the investigation of crimes. The public
are generally reluctant to come forward to depose before the Court. It is,
therefore, not correct to reject the prosecution version only on the ground
that all witnesses to the occurrence have not been examined. Nor it is proper
to reject the case for want of corroboration by independent witnesses if the
case made out is otherwise true and acceptable.
14\. Hon'ble Supreme court in the case Ambika Prasad & anr vs. State 2002 (2)
CRIMES 63 (SC) held that it is known fact that independent persons are
reluctant to be a witness or to assist the investigation. In any case if
independent persons are not willing to cooperate with the investigation,
prosecution cannot be blamed at and it cannot be a ground for rejecting the
evidence of injured witnesses. Similarly in the case of State of U.P. vs. Anil
JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 9 of 13/DK Singh AIR 1988 SC 1998 ; Dr Krishna Pal
and another vs. State of U. P.1996 (7) SCC 194 and in the case of Appabhai Vs.
State Of Gujrat AIR 1988 SC 696 it was held that These days people in the
vicinity where the incident took place avoid to come forward to give evidence
and civilized people are in-sensitive when crime is committed even in their
presence and they withdraw both from the victim and vigilante.
15\. Law is not that testimony of police officers is absolutely untrustworthy
or that it can never be acted upon. Rather, the law is that even the testimony
of a police officer can be acted upon and a conviction can be based on such
testimony if the testimony is unimpeached and found to be trustworthy.
16\. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anil @ Andya Sadashiv Nandorkar Vs. State J. T.
1996 (3) SC 120 has held that testimony of the police officials cannot be
discredited merely because they are police officials if otherwise, their
testimony is found to be cogent, trustworthy and reliable. Further, Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Akmal Ahmad Vs. State of Delhi J. T 1999 (2) SC 388 held that
''it is now well settled that evidence of search and seizure made by police
will not become vitiated only for the reasons that the evidence is not
supported by independent witnesses.''
17\. In the present case, I have already mentioned above that there is nothing
on record to suggest untrustworthiness of the witnesses including police
officials. Although the accused in his statement claimed that he is innocent
and that case property was planted upon him by the police but the defence
taken by the JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act
& 292 IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 10 of 13/DK accused does not inspire any
confidence whatsoever. It would be anybody guess as to why prosecution
witnesses would do this. If the accused want this court to believe that he has
been implicated falsely, the least which was expected from the accused was to
at least come out as to what could have been the motive for the police for his
false implication and as to what was that reason for which police official
could have done so. But no such reason is even mentioned or suggested to the
witnesses. The accused cannot expect this court to believe his version by
simple bare allegation that he is falsely implicated. At least some reason
should have been put forth by the accused to suggest as to what could have
been motive of the police in implicating them. In the absence of this, I do
not find any reason to throw out the testimony of witnesses.
18\. The arguments of Ld. Counsel for accused that there is no complainant of
copyright holder in the present matter and therefore the case could not have
been investigated is without any force. The offences u/s 63 and 68-A Copyright
Act are both cognizable offences and, in a cognizable offence there is no
legal requirement that police cannot investigate without proper complaint or
without orders of the court. A police officer who receives information
regarding commission of a cognizable offence can investigate the matter
directly. In such circumstances, this argument is absolutely without any
force.
19\. In my considered view, the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case
against the accused beyond reasonable doubts. It is proved that from the
possession of accused 467 infringed VCD of various movies were recovered and
also 268 of blue films containing obscene video clippings were recovered. None
of JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act & 292
IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 11 of 13/DK those VCDs were not carrying mandatory
particulars as required u/s 52-A of Copyright Act, 1957.
20\. Section 51 of The Copyright Act 1957 provides, that copyright in a work
shall be deemed to be infringed when any person by way of trade exhibits in
public or makes for sale or hire, or sells or lets for hire, or by way of
trade displays or offers for sale or hire any infringing copies of the work.
Section 63 of The Copyright Act 1957 makes punishable offence of infringement
defined in section 51 of the said Act and it provides that when any person
knowingly infringes or abets the infringement of the copyright in a work he
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
six months but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not
be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to two Lakhs Rs on
first conviction.
21\. The VCDs recovered from the accused did not carry necessary particulars
as required in sec 52A of the Act. Section 52A of The Copyright Act provides,
that in respect of sound and video recording no person shall publish a sound
recording in respect of any work unless it displays the name and address of
the person who made the sound recording, the name and address of the owner of
the copyright in such work, and the year of its first publication.
22\. In the present case the VCDs which are recovered does not contain the
mandatory particulars as described above and therefore the accused is also
liable for punishment under section 68A of the Copyright Act which makes
punishable JUDGMENT/State Vs. Mohinder Pal/FIR NO. 600/01/US:63/68­A CR Act &
292 IPC/Convicted/09.06.09/Page 12 of 13/DK the offence described in section
52A of The Copyright Act 1957. Section 68 A provides, that any person who
publishes a sound recording in contravention of the provisions of section 52A
shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three years and
shall also be liable to fine.
23\. It may be mentioned here that in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh Vs.
Nagoti Venkataramana IV(1996) CCR 42 (SC) Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that
proof of copyright ownership by the author of the pirated articles is not
required for the purpose of trial for offences under Copyright Act.
24\. Therefore, the accused is guilty for the offences U/s 63 & 68A of
Copyright Act, 1957. It is also proved that accused was possessing blue films
VCDs which were containing obscene video clippings and that those VCDs were
displayed in a shop, they were meant for sale/letting/hire and nothing else
and thereby the accused committed the offence u/s 292 IPC and accused is
accordingly convicted for the offences u/s 63 & 68A of the Copyright Act, 1957
