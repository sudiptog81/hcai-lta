ORDER S.L. Peeran, Member (J)
1\. This is a Revenue appeal against the order dated 28-7-1989, passed by the
Collector of Customs (Appeals), Madras, who has allowed the Collector
(Appeals) order and ordered for registration of 'project contract' for import
of capital goods required to set up Video software Generation facilities. The
respondents had produced the required import licence and also recommendatory
letter from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, New Delhi. The
original authorities had rejected the said request for registration on the
ground that Chapter Heading 9801 of CTA extends project rate of duty only for
industrial plants or Other specified projects notified by the Government of
India, and the project for which the benefit was sought is not an 'industrial
plant' to merit registration under project contract regulations. The learned
Collector after considering the respondents' plea held that the imported
equipment includes colour monitor, Microprocess based video editing system,
Dual Channel-time based corrector with special effects, special effect
generator, wave form monitor and others. According to the project report, the
equipment is mainly utilised in producing video films. He has noted that the
Plant'. As we have held that the activity of video recording is akin to
recording of sound cassettes and that it is also akin to a photographic
studio, therefore, the activity of the respondents is more a trading activity
and does not come within the ambit of industrial plant for the purpose of
registering their contract and the benefit under Chapter Heading 9801 of the
Customs Tariff Act.
18\. We notice that the Tribunal in the case of Collector of Customs v.
Sarathi Studio Pvt. Ltd. (supra) has held that the camera for studio films is
not eligible for benefit under Project Import Regulation.
19\. The Madras High Court in the case of Suresh Colour Labs v. Union of India
(supra) held that photographic studio and labs do not fall within the ambit of
Project Import.
20\. Likewise, Bombay High Court in the case of Subhash Photographies (supra)
also held that photographic machinery and the mini lab systems imported by the
photographic studios and photographic film processing laboratories are not
entitled to the Project Import benefit under Heading 9801 of Customs Tariff
equipment is mainly utilised in producing video films. He has noted that the
imported equipment is augmented by processing from indigenous source, video
camera, VCR, audio mixer and other item available locally. He has noted that
the recording is done on a blank video cassette. The learned Collector has
held that the activity of converting the blank video cassette into a recorded
one could be considered as industrial activity and the equipment utilised in
such process as 'Industrial Plant'. He has held that the activity involved in
converting cassette into a recorded cassette would comprise a series of
processes like shooting with video camera, mixing, dubbing, addition of
special effect etc. with the help of imported equipments. He has held that
these processes according to the definition given in the Notification should
result in a "commodity". In this context, the dictionary meaning of
'commodity' had been relied which states that a 'commodity' is an article
which commands a price in the market and hence he has held that the recorded
video cassette satisfies this definition and hence he has held that the
equipments satisfies the term "Industrial Plant".
3\. He has held that the activity would not fall within the term of 'service
establishment', hence are not excluded from the scope of "Industrial Plant"
and hence accepted the respondents' plea for registration of the imported
items under project contract and assessment under Heading 9801 of CTA.
4\. The Revenue is aggrieved with this finding and it is contended that the
term "Industrial Plant" has been defined as an industrial system designed to
be employed directly in the performance of any process or service of processes
necessary for manufacture, production or extraction of a commodity but does
not include establishments designed to offer services of any description such
as hotels, hospitals, photographic studios, laundries, photographic film
processing Laboratories, garages and workshops. It is stated that the imported
equipments are used for processes like editing, dubbing etc., of video films
and this will not be covered by the description "Industrial Plant" and
excluded from the purview of the same. It is stated that the Collector
(Appeals) has erred in holding that the dictionary meaning of the word
'commodity' is applicable and concluding that the activity of converting a
blank video cassette into a recorded one is an industrial activity, is
erroneous.
5\. The Revenue also challenges the Collector (Appeals)' findings viz.
photographic film processing and cinematographic film processing are entirely
different and it is stated that the basic principle and activity of both the
processes are identical and hence, they are excluded from the description
"Industrial Plant". The Revenue states that the equipments in question are not
eligible for 'Project Contract' benefits as the same is not notified
specifically as a project by the Government.
6\. We have heard the learned DR, Shri S.N. Ojha for the Revenue and the
learned Advocate, Dr. Francis Julian for the respondents.
7\. Reiterating the grounds made out in the appeal memo by the learned DR
submitted that the activity of video recording does not fall within the
definition of "Industrial Plant" in terms of Regulation 3 (a) of Project
Import Regulation, 1986 which defines 'Industrial Plant', he submits that the
various processes carried out by the respondents could not result in a
commodity as held by the Collector (Appeals). It is his submission that the
activity falls within 'the exclusion clause of definition of "Industrial
Plant". The activity falls within the term photographic studios, photographic
film processing laboratories which comes within the exclusion clause of
Regulation 3(a)(i) which reads as follows: -
"(i) establishment designed to offer services of any description such as
hotels, hospitals, photographic studios, photographic film processing
laboratories, photocopying studio, laundries, garages, and workshops."
8\. The learned DR relies on an unreported judgment rendered by the SRB in the
case of Popular Video Audio Private Ltd. v. Collector of Customs, Madras, as
per Order No. 229/1988. The learned DR relied on the ratio of the following
judgments: -
1\. Subhash Photographies v. Union of India \- 1992 (62) E.L.T. 270 (Bom.)
2\. Subhash Photographies v. Union of India -1993 (66) E.L.T. 3 (S.C.)
3\. Suresh Colour Labs. v. Union of India -1993 (64) E.L.T. 399
4\. Collector of Customs v. Sarathi Studio Pvt. Ltd. -1994 (73) E.L.T. 382
9\. The learned DR also pointed out that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Prabhat Sound Studios v. Additional Collector of Central Excise as reported
in 1996 (88) E.L.T. 635 has held that recording of sound on duty paid magnetic
cassette tapes or spool magnetic tapes does not amount to manufacture as no
new substance or commodity emerges by sound recording and has further confirms
the Tribunal's judgment rendered in the case of M. Basheer Ahammed v.
Collector of Central Excise, as reported in 1990 (48) E.L.T. 591, which held
that re-recording on pre-recorded tape by erasing pre-recorded cassette could
not be considered as a process of manufacture and therefore, the learned DR
submits that in the light of this judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the
finding given by the Collector is erroneous.
10\. Dr. Francis Julian, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondents
vehemently argued the case and supported the reasoning given by the Collector.
He submits that the activity of video recording falls within the definition of
"Industrial Plant" as defined in the Regulation and the activity is not a
service activity and cannot be compared with photographic studios or
photographic film processing laboratories. It is his submission that the video
recording of a film brings into existence a distinct commodity in the market
and the activity is akin to producing cinema using cinematographic equipment.
The production and exhibition is regulated by the Cinematographic Act and the
corresponding State laws relating to cinema and video. Relying on the judgment
rendered in the case of South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, Madras v.
Enterprising Enterprises as reported in 1995 (2) SCC 462. He argued that the
term Video film' would come under the expression 'cinema' in Entry 33 of List
II. He also relied on the judgment rendered in the case of Laxmi Video
-Theatre and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Ors. as reported in 1993 (3) SCC
715, wherein the Supreme Court held that the expression 'cinematograph' as
defined under Section 2(c) of the Cinematograph includes video parlour wherein
pre-recorded cassette of a cinematograph film is exhibited through VCR. He
also referred to Section 2(f) of the Copy Rights Act, 1957, which defines
"Cinematograph film" and submitted that the video film would fall within the
said definition. It is his submission that the video software generation is
totally different from the photography both in the technology involved and in
the manner of its commercial use. Therefore, it is his submission that the
activity cannot be considered as a service industry and is not excluded from
the definition of "Industrial Plant". It is his submission that the equipments
used by the respondents produces a distinct commodity which has got a market.
Drawing our attention to the definition of Photography, the learned Advocate
submitted that the photography is a process of producing a visible image upon
a substance by the action of light or other radiant energy. It is his
submission that on the other hand in video equipment video electro magnetic
media is used to record the image in a video tape electromagnetically. In a
video a series of picture are produced similar to cinematography, whereas in
photography a single picture is produced. Thus the technology and processes
involved in photography and videography are totally different and therefore,
video studios or video laboratory would not fall within the expression of
photo studio or photographic laboratories. He also referred to the expression
'Photography' as defined in Oxford Dictionary which states :-
"The process or art of producing pictures by means of the chemical action of
light on a sensitive film on a basis of paper, glass metal etc.; the business
of producing and printing such pictures."
11\. The learned Advocate also referred to the definition of expression
'Video' as defined in Dictionary as :
"1. That which is displayed or to be displayed on a television screen or other
cathode-ray tube; the signal corresponding to this,
2\. Television as a broadcasting medium."
12\. He referred to the "Video recording" which states :-
"1. (a) The process of making a cinematographic film of what appears on
television screen,
(b) The process of recording on video [tape]; 2. A film of a television
broadcast. B. A recording on a video tape."
13\. Referring to all these materials, the learned Advocate submits that the
activity of video cassette recording and production of video film is akin to
cinematographic film and does not fall within the exclusion of the term
"Industrial Plant" and therefore, the Collector's reasoning for allowing the
benefit of Project Import is sustainable.
14\. We have carefully considered the submissions made by both the sides and
have perused the materials produced before us including the citations.
15\. The question before us is as to whether the imported items which are for
setting up of video software generation facilities could be considered as
falling within the definition of "Industrial Plant" as per Regulation 3(a) of
Project Import Regulation, 1986, which defines "Industrial Plant". We notice
that the definition "Industrial Plant" has been defined to mean the industrial
system designed to be employed directly in the performance of any process or
series of processes necessary for manufacture, production or extraction of a
commodity, but does, not include:
"(i) establishment designed to offer services of any description such as
hotels, hospitals, photographic studios, photographic film processing
laboratories, photocopying studio, laundries, garages, and workshops; or
(ii) a single machine or a composite machine within the meaning assigned to
it, in Notes 3 and 4 to Section XVI of the First Schedule."
16\. The Lower authorities had rejected the registration of the project on the
ground that the Heading 9801 of the Customs Tariff Act excludes the importers'
activity and it does not fall within the ambit of "Industrial Plant" as
defined therein. We have noted the learned Collector's reasoning. The learned
Collector has held that these activities brings into existence the commodity,
which is vedio film and the said commodity has got a market. On a careful
consideration, we have to hold that in the first place, the various process of
recording video film would not result in a commodity, although it may have a
market. The reason being that that recording is done on a video cassette and
the said cassette can be re-used for recording by erasing the recorded
material. Such recording of sound* on duty paid magnetic tapes or spool
magnetic tape has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prabhat Sound Studio
to be not a process of manufacture and mat no new substance emerges by such
recording. In the present case also the process of recording pictures on a
vedio film with the help of video camera is akin to recording sound on duty
paid magnetic cassette tapes. Therefore, such an activity of video recording
does not amount to manufacture, production or extraction of a commodity,
although such a recorded video cassette may have a market.
17\. It has to be observed that the project import is granted to "Industrial
Plant" which helps in the manufacture, production or extraction of a commodity
and those commodities are specifically classified under Customs Tariff Act and
also under Central Excise Tariff Act. In the Central Excise Tariff Act, excise
duty is levied on such manufacture of a commodity. On a specific query from
the Bench, both the sides stated that no excise duty is paid on the recording
of a video film. From this point of view, the activity is of a service
industry and not a manufacturing industrial activity and therefore, the
activity of video recording would fall within the exclusion clause of
"Industrial Plant". The Photographic studios or photographic film processing
laboratories offers services to customers for taking photographic pictures and
processing the same. The very studios are also offering video recording
services to the same customers. The learned Advocate relied on the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Southern Film Chamber of Commerce. This
judgment is in the context of licence to be obtained by Video Cassette Library
for the purpose of carrying on business of selling, letting to hire,
distribution, exchange or putting into circulation in any manner whatsoever of
video films recorded on video cassette tape, is required by Section 9(2) of
the Act and the T. N. Exhibition of Films on Television Screen through Video
Cassette Recorders (Regulation) Act, 1984. This judgment has been rendered in
the context of the specific requirement for registering such an activity under
the said legislation. In this case we -are concerned with the definition of
'Industrial Plant' in terms of Regulation 3(a) of the Project Import
Regulation, 1986 and therefore, the citation is clearly distinguishable.
Likewise, the judgment rendered in the case of Laxmi Video Theatre and Ors. is
also in the context of Punjab Cinema Regulation Act, 1952 which regulates the
activity of cinematography. The judgment of Madras High Court rendered in the
case of Super Recording Company Pvt. Ltd. v. Government of India, as reported
in 1992 (61) E.L.T. 17, is no longer a good law in view of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court's judgment rendered in the case of Prabhat Sound. Studios. It has to be
noticed that the judgment of the Madras High Court is in respect of pre-
recorded cassettes by sound duplication on tape to tape and does not deal with
the video recording. However, even this judgment gets overruled by the noted
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The learned DR has relied on the
judgment of the SRB rendered in the case of Popular Video Audio Private Ltd.
v. Collector of Customs, as per Order No. 229/1988, wherein the Tribunal has
held that the activity of sound recording from the master tape to cassette
tape is more of a trading activity and if the appellants were carrying on such
an activity as a process of manufacture, they have not probabilised this claim
of theirs by any material evidence, by way of their agreements for manufacture
on a large scale, or the contract entered into by them to supply of duplicated
cassettes on a large scale. The Tribunal has also noted that the appellants
have not even mentioned what is the brand name under which the product they
are to (sic.) is going to be marketed. The Tribunal has also noted that the
other features referred to by the Collector (Appeal) viz., that these machines
do not have to be installed as in an industrial plant but are portable
equipments is also relevant. The Tribunal has noted that the appellants have
also not given any details regarding the machinery and equipment and the
approval of their operations from the State Government authorities for the
assembly of cassettes, which they say, they are undertaking. In these
circumstances, the appellants claim for registration of Project Import was
rejected by the Tribunal. We are of, the opinion that the ratio of this
judgment is applicable to the facts of this case, as we notice on perusal of
the documents that the appellants have not produced any material to establish
that they are to manufacture large scale printed films under any brand name as
noted by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has clearly noted that such an activity is
akin to trading activity and does not fall within the ambit of 'Industrial
Plant'. As we have held that the activity of video recording is akin to
recording of sound cassettes and that it is also akin to a photographic
studio, therefore, the activity of the respondents is more a trading activity
and does not come within the ambit of industrial plant for the purpose of
registering their contract and the benefit under Chapter Heading 9801 of the
Customs Tariff Act.
18\. We notice that the Tribunal in the case of Collector of Customs v.
Sarathi Studio Pvt. Ltd. (supra) has held that the camera for studio films is
not eligible for benefit under Project Import Regulation.
19\. The Madras High Court in the case of Suresh Colour Labs v. Union of India
(supra) held that photographic studio and labs do not fall within the ambit of
Project Import.
20\. Likewise, Bombay High Court in the case of Subhash Photographies (supra)
also held that photographic machinery and the mini lab systems imported by the
photographic studios and photographic film processing laboratories are not
entitled to the Project Import benefit under Heading 9801 of Customs Tariff
Act, 1975.
21\. In that view of the matter, we do not find sufficient force and merit in
this case and for the reasons stated, we set aside the impugned order and
allow the appeal.

recording of sound cassettes and that it is also akin to a photographic
