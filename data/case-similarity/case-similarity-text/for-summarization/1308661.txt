different concern of reputation it cannot be said that service in the hospital
of the appellant is being passed off as that of the first respondent. This
distinctive fact is sufficient to hold that first respondent is not entitled
to the decree granted by the learned District Judge. When the evidence do not
establish that first respondent has any exclusive A.S. 3/1993 28 right in the
name Santhigiri learned District Judge was not justified in granting a
declaration to that effect. Evidence only establish that first respondent is
having an Ashram by name Santhigiri and is also running Vydhyasala and School
all suffixing the name with Santhigiri before the name of the respective
institution. But that will not give an exclusive right like a trade mark or
trade name to the first respondent. Therefore the decree granted by the
learned District Judge is not sustainable.
Appeal is allowed. The decree and judgment passed in O.S.2/1986 by District
Judge, Thiruvananthapuram is set aside. O.S.2/1986 stands dismissed. No cost.

M.SASIDHARAN NAMBIAR, J.
                       JUDGMENT
First defendant in O.S.2/1986 on the file of District Court,
Thiruvananthapuram is the appellant. On the death of the appellant additional
appellant was impleaded as his legal heir. Later respondents 2 to 6 were also
impleaded as other legal heirs of deceased appellant. Original respondent is
the plaintiff in the suit, an institution by name "Santhigiri Ashramam"
registered under the Travancore Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable
Societies Act. Suit was filed for a declaration that first respondent is the
exclusive owner of trade name "Santhigiri" and for a permanent prohibitory
injunction restraining defendants from using the trade mark 'Santhigiri' in
the name of the A.S. 3/1993 2 institutions sign boards, Bills, Vouchers,
Labels etc. The allegations in the plaint are that late Karunakara Guru
founded Santhirigiri Ashramam 25 years back for the upliftment and spiritual
development of man and the Ashram is at Koliyakode in Thiruvananthapuram and
it has branches at Palarivattom (Ernakulam District) and Kallar (Idukki
District) and Sultan Battery (Wayanad District) and new branches are being
established. Santhigiri Ashram was registered as an institution under the
Tranvancore-Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act and the
Ashram has multifaced activities in the spiritual, Educational, Medical and
Women's Welfare Activities and Koliyakode is the seat of the Guru. Santhigiri
Vidhya Bhavan a residential English Medium School, Santhigiri Engineering and
Construction Company, Santhigiri Mathrumandalam, Santhigiri Ayurveda
Vaidyasala are all being run by Santhigiri Ashramam. It is also alleged that
an A.S. 3/1993 3 Ayurvedic Hospital Complex at an estimated cost of Rs.28
lakhs is nearing completion at Koliyakode with the financial assistance of
South Indian Bank and Santhigiri Hospital cum Research Centre for doing
research in Ayurvedic, Homeo, Naturopathy and Sidha Systems of medicine are
being started at the Hospital Complex. Santhigiri Vaidyasala products carry a
special label with letters "Santhigiri Ayurveda Vaidyasala" on top and
Santhigiri Ashram with the address "Koliyakode P.O., Venjaramoodu, Trivandrum.
First respondent specifically pleaded that Santhigiri is the trade mark
designed and used by the Ashram for the last more than 8 years prior to the
institution of the suit in the medical field and it is the exclusive property
and the name has distinctive feature of its own so that Santhigiri has became
a trade name of mark of Santhigiri Ayurveda Vaidyasala products and services.
Defendants have published an advertisement regarding the Santhigiri Health
Complex to be A.S. 3/1993 4 inaugurated by the Minister at Kalamasseri on
2.2.1986. It is contended that the use of the word Santhigiri was given with
malicious intention of passing off the institution and services and products
of first respondent Ashram and it was to deliberately mislead the public and
if they are allowed to use the trade name Santhigiri to their institution, it
will pass off the place of treatment and services of the first respondent and
therefore a decree is to be granted.
2\. Defendants in the joint written statement contended that first respondent
has no registered trade mark and respondent Ashram has not acquired any trade
name Santhigiri and the labels used by first respondent for their medical
products cannot be treated as a trade mark and based on that usage first
respondent is not entitled to institute the suit. It was also contended that
defendants have started Santhigiri Health Complex at Kalamassery and the name
of the Health Complex was given after A.S. 3/1993 5 its place where it is
situated and the rooms of the Health Complex building are let out by the
appellant to persons who come over there for treatment and second defendant is
the person in control of the medical treatment and the Health Complex is not
preparing any kind of medicine and all the medicines used are the one prepared
by the second defendant in his P.N.V.M. Hospital and there is no passing off
the business or services of the first respondent and therefore the suit is
only to be dismissed.
3\. Learned District Judge on the evidence of Pws. 1 to 3 and Exts.A1 to A60
found that the term Santhigiri has been used by the first respondent in the
name of Vydhyasala and also labels of its medicines and it is the use the said
trade name and first respondent is therefore entitled to the protection for
the use of that trade name. Finding that defendants started using the same
trade name for their Health Complex, it was held A.S. 3/1993 6 that if the
defendants are allowed to use the name Santhigiri for the Health Complex and
allied business, it would amount to passing off the name, good will and
reputation of the respondent and granted a decree declaring that first
respondent is the exclusive owner of the trade name Santhigiri and restraining
defendants by a permanent prohibitory injunction from using the trade name or
mark Santhigiri in their Signboards, Bills, Vouchers, Labels and Designs or
Symbols. The decree is challenged in this appeal.
4\. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the contesting respondents
were heard.
5\. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant pointed out that the suit was
instituted as if first respondent has got a right to use the trade name
Santhigiri. It is admitted case that no such trade name was registered in
favour of the first respondent. It was argued that the case of the first
respondent is that Karunakara Guru A.S. 3/1993 7 established Santhigiri Ashram
and it is a society registered under the Travancore Cochin Literary Scientific
and Charitable Societies Act and thereafter a Vydhyasala by name Santhigiri
Vydhyasala which started manufacturing ayurvedic medicines and later schools
and other establishments in the name Santhigiri were started and as no such
trade mark or trade name was registered as provided under the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act,1958, first respondent is not entitled to seek a decree
based on the trade mark. Learned counsel relying on the decision of the Apex
Court in S.M.Dyechem Ltd v. Cadbury (India) Ltd (2000) 5 SCC 573), K.Narayanan
and another v. S. Murali (2008) 10 SCC 479), and Durga Dutt Sharma v.
N.P.Laboratories (AIR 1965 SC 980) argued that the learned District Judge did
not properly appreciate the case or decide the question and therefore the
decree is not sustainable. Learned counsel also argued that evidence of PW1
A.S. 3/1993 8 establish that the only similarity is usage of the name
Santhigiri by the appellant as the name is Santhirigi Hospital Complex and PW1
himself admitted that that Hospital Complex is known as P.N.V.M Santhigiri
Hospital Complex which cannot be deceptively similar to the name used by the
first respondent viz Santhigiri Ashram or Santhigiri Ayurvedic Medicines or
Engineering Schools. It is therefore argued that the decree is only to be set
aside. Learned counsel also pointed out that apart from the evidence of PW1,
there is no evidence to prove that any person mistook the Ayurvedic Hospital
Complex run by the appellant as an Institution run by the first respondent and
as appellant is not manufacturing any medicines and are only using the
medicine prepared by P.N.V.M. Hospital and therefore there is no passing of
the business of the first respondent and therefore learned District Judge
should not have granted the decree.
A.S. 3/1993 9
6\. Learned counsel appearing for first respondent argued that fact that
Karunakara Guru established Santhigiri Ashram and Santhigiri Ashram is running
a Santhigiri Ayurveda Vydhyasala, Santhigiri Engineering and Construction
Company, Santhigiri Vidhyabhavan and Santhigiri Medical Supplies as found by
the learned District Judge is not disputed and therefore the fact that first
respondent has been using the trade name Santhigiri previous to the use by the
appellant is admitted and though the trade mark or trade name is not
registered, as provided under sub section (2) of Section 27 of the said Act,
the fact that trade mark is unregistered does not affect the right of action
against the appellant for passing of goods, as the goods of another person or
seeking remedies in respect thereof and therefore the suit is maintainable.
The learned counsel also argued that defendants did not adduce any evidence
and the evidence of first respondent establish that the A.S. 3/1993 10 word
Santhigiri is being used as the trade name by first respondent eight years
prior to the institution of the suit and therefore defendants cannot use the
same trade name Santhigiri which is deceptively similar to the one which is
being used by the first respondent and therefore learned District Judge
rightly granted the decree. Learned counsel relied on the decision of the Apex
Court in S.M.Dyechem Ltd v. Cadbury (India) Ltd (2000) 5 SCC 573, Parle
Products (P) Ltd v. J.P. & Co. Mysore (AIR 1972 SC 1359) and Dhariwal
Industries Ltd v. M.S.S. Food Products (2005 (3) SCC 63) and N.R.Dongre and
others v. Whirlpool Corporation and another (1996) 5 SCC 714) and argued that
the decree granted is perfectly legal and correct.
7\. Section 28 of the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 provides the rights
conferred by registration of a trade mark and Section 29 provides for action
for infringement of trade marks. Under sub section (1) of Section 27, no A.S.
3/1993 11 person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent, or
to recover damages for, the infringement of an unregistered trade mark. But
sub section (2) explicitly makes it clear that nothing in Section 27 shall be
deemed to affect the rights of action against any person for passing off goods
as the goods of another person or the remedies in respect thereof. Therefore
reason that a trade mark or trade name is not registered as provided under the
Act is not a bar for an action for passing off goods as the goods of another
person. An action for infringement of a trade mark and an action for passing
off are different and distinct. The right for an action for passing off is not
a statutory right but a common law right.
8\. The necessary elements of an action for passing off restated by the House
of the Lords in Erven Warnink BV v. J.Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd (1979 ) A.C.
731) was quoted by the Division Bench A.S. 3/1993 12 of this Court in Preme v.
Ambujakshan (2006(1) KLT
905) as follows:-
> "1. that the plaintiff's goods or services have acquired a goodwill or
> reputation in the market, and are known by some distinguishing feature.
               2.      that   there   is    a
               misrepresentation    by    the
               defendant  (whether   or   not
> intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that the goods
> or services offered by the defendant are goods or services of the plaintiff;
> and
> 3\. that the plaintiff has suffered or is likelyto suffer damage as a result
> of the A.S. 3/1993 13 erroneous belief engendered by defendant's
> misrepresentation. To establish a likelihood of deception or confusion in an
> action for passing off where there has been no direct misrepresentation
> generally requires the presence of two factual elements:-
> i) that a name, mark or other distinctive feature used by the plaintiff has
> acquired a reputation among a relevant class of persons; and
> ii) that members of that class will mistakenly infer from the defendant's
> use of a name, mark or other feature which is the same or sufficiently
> similar that the defendant's goods or business are A.S. 3/1993 14 from the
> same source or are connected.
9\. Apex Court in National Sewing Thread Co.Ltd, Chidambaram v. James Chadwick
and Bros (A.I.R.1953 SC 357) laid the law that the onus in a passing off
action rests on plaintiff to prove whether there is likelihood of the
defendants goods being passed off as the goods of the plaintiffs and the
considerations relevant in a passing off action are somewhat different than
they are in an application made for registration of a mark under the Trade
Marks Act.
10.In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. N.P. Laboratories (A.I.R.1965 SC 980
) considering an action for passing off Apex Court held:-
> "While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance
> an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of A.S. 3/1993 15
> his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for
> infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on
> the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of
> "the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those
> goods." (Vide S.21 of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark
> of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the
> sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, A.S.
> 3/1993 16 where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of
> the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of
> both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
> imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an
> action for infringing of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence
> between the two ceases. In an action for infringement the plaintiff must, no
> doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely A.S. 3/1993
> 17 to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiffs and the
> defendants mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and
> the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
> evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated.
> Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the
> plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,
> packing and other writing or marks on the A.S. 3/1993 18 goods or on the
> packet in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or
> indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered
> proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing
> off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter
> is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff."
The fact that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has a registered trade
mark as on the date of the suit cannot stand in the way of entertaining the
claim of the plaintiff in a passing off action. (See 2005(3) SCC 63). So also
A.S. 3/1993 19 the fact that as the trade mark was subsequently registered in
the name of the defendant will not defeat an action for passing off by the
plaintiff.
11\. Apex Court in S.M.Dyechem Ltd v. Cadbury (India) Ltd (2000) 5 SCC 573
considering the difference of an action for passing off an infringement held:-
> 48\. Here the point is in relation to relative strength of the parties on
> the question of "passing off". As discussed under Point 5, the proof of
> resemblance or similarity in case of passing off and infringement are
> different. In a passing off action, additions, get-up or trade-dress might
> be relevant to enable the defendant to escape. In infringement cases, such
> facts do not assume A.S. 3/1993 20 relevance. (See Durga Dutt Sharma v.
> Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. Zamindara
> Engg.Co and Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd.
> 49\. It is possible that, on the same facts, a suit for passing off may fail
> but a suit for infringement may succeed because the additions, the get-up
> and trade-dress may enable a defendant to escape in passing off action. A
> somewhat similar but interesting situation arose in a dispute between two
> companies. In National Sewing Thread Co.Ltd v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd,
> the A.S. 3/1993 21 passing off action failed. But thereafter James Chadwick
> Co. succeeded in an appeal arising out of the registration proceedings and
> the said judgment was confirmed by this Court in National Sewing Thread Co.
> Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros Ltd. It was held that the judgment in the
> passing off case could not be relied upon by the opposite side in latter
> registration proceedings.
> 50\. In the same tone, Halsbury (Trade Marks, 4th Edn., 1984, Vol.48, para
> 187) says that in a passing off action their "degree of similarity of the
> A.S. 3/1993 22 name, mark or other features concerned is important but not
> necessarily decisive, so that an action for infringement of a registered
> trademark may succeed on the same facts where a passing off action fails or
> vice versa"
> As to vice versa, Kerly says (para 16.12) an infringement action may fail
> where the plaintiff cannot prove registration or that its registration
> extends to the goods or to all the goods in question or because the
> registration is invalid and yet the plaintiff may show that by imitating the
> mark or otherwise, the defendant has A.S. 3/1993 23 done what is calculated
> to pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff."
12\. The dispute in the case is to be settled in the light of the settled
legal position.
13\. What was claimed by the first respondent in the plaint is that "
Santhigiri is the trade mark designed and used by the plaintiff for the last
more than eight years in the medical field and it is exclusively its property.
This name has a distinctive feature of its own so much so Santhigiri has
become a trade name of mark of Santhigiri Ayuveda Vydhayasala products and
services." Learned District Judge relying on the evidence of PW1 and Exts.A1
to A60 found that the term Santhigiri is used by the first respondent in the
name of its Vydhyasala and labels of its medicines and thus it is made the
trade name and first respondent is entitled to protection of the use of that
trade name.
A.S. 3/1993 24
14\. Though PW1 has given evidence in support of the claim of the first
respondent, his evidence do not establish that first respondent had acquired a
right in the trade name Santhigiri. The pleadings and the evidence show that
Karunakara Guru founded an Ashram at Pothencode which was later shifted to
Koliyakkode and the name of the Ashram was Santhigiri Ashram. Evidence would
also establish that Santhigiri Ashram is registered evidenced by Ext.A1, under
the Travancore Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act.
Evidence also establish that subsequently Ashram widened its activities on
education, medical and women welfare activities. It is in evidence that a
residential English Medium School Santhigiri Vidhyabhavan, an Engineering
Construction Company by name Santhigiri Engineering and Construction Company
and a Hospital Complex by name Santhigiri Hospital and Research Centre was
under the construction, A.S. 3/1993 25 at the time of institution of the suit
which was later started functioning. Evidence also establish that Santhigiri
Ayurveda Vydhyasala started manufacturing medicines in the name Santhigiri
Vydhyala and thereafter started Santhigiri Medical Supplies for the supply of
medicines. The evidence do not establish that first respondent had used the
trade name "Santhigiri". On the other hand, evidence only establish that along
with the name Santhigiri first respondent named the institution whether it is
a Vydhyasala or educational institution or Engineering Company. The question
is whether by such usage, it could be said that first respondent had a right
for the exclusive use of the word Santhigiri and if that be so, whether the
starting of a Hospital Complex by name Santhigiri Health Complex by the
defendants would amount to passing off the business or the service of the
first respondent.
A.S. 3/1993 26
15\. As stated earlier, eventhough the proof of resemblance or similarity in a
case of infringement is not relevant, that is not the case with an action for
passing off. A suit for passing off may fail, if there is difference in the
get-up and trade-dress, though it may not be a defence in an action for
infringement of the trade mark. If defendant could establish that the usage of
additional words distinguishes it from the other, it would be a relevant
factor in an action for passing off, though it is not relevant in an action
for infringement of the trade mark. But if the additions are sufficient enough
to prevent it from being sold as the other it would be sufficient to non-suit
the plaintiff in an action for passing off. Unfortunately this distinction was
not taken note of by the learned District Judge.
16\. Ext.A32 the paper publication of the inauguration of the Hospital Complex
by the A.S. 3/1993 27 appellant in the name of Santhigiri Hospital Complex
itself establish that anybody seeing the name would realise that it is not a
branch or concern of the Santhigiri Ashram but a sister concern of P.N.V.M.
Hospital. PW1 himself admitted that the Board of the appellant is to the
effect that it is the sister concern of P.N.V.M. Hospital. Therefore when the
first respondent is running a Hospital Complex, though in the name of
Santhigiri Hospital Complex, making it clear that the hospital is not part of
the Santhigiri Ashram but a sister concern of P.N.V.M. Hospital an entirely
different concern of reputation it cannot be said that service in the hospital
of the appellant is being passed off as that of the first respondent. This
distinctive fact is sufficient to hold that first respondent is not entitled
to the decree granted by the learned District Judge. When the evidence do not
establish that first respondent has any exclusive A.S. 3/1993 28 right in the
name Santhigiri learned District Judge was not justified in granting a
declaration to that effect. Evidence only establish that first respondent is
having an Ashram by name Santhigiri and is also running Vydhyasala and School
all suffixing the name with Santhigiri before the name of the respective
institution. But that will not give an exclusive right like a trade mark or
trade name to the first respondent. Therefore the decree granted by the
learned District Judge is not sustainable.
Appeal is allowed. The decree and judgment passed in O.S.2/1986 by District
Judge, Thiruvananthapuram is set aside. O.S.2/1986 stands dismissed. No cost.

to the decree granted by the learned District Judge. When the evidence do not
establish that first respondent has any exclusive A.S. 3/1993 28 right in the
name Santhigiri learned District Judge was not justified in granting a
declaration to that effect. Evidence only establish that first respondent is
having an Ashram by name Santhigiri and is also running Vydhyasala and School
all suffixing the name with Santhigiri before the name of the respective
institution. But that will not give an exclusive right like a trade mark or
trade name to the first respondent. Therefore the decree granted by the
learned District Judge is not sustainable.
Appeal is allowed. The decree and judgment passed in O.S.2/1986 by District
Judge, Thiruvananthapuram is set aside. O.S.2/1986 stands dismissed. No cost.
