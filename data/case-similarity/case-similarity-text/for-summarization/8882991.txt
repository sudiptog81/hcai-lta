                                    For Petitioner    :     Mr. A.L.Somayaji, Senior Counsel
                                                            for Mr. M.P.Senthil Kumar

                                                        ORDER
(through video conference) Heard Mr. A.L.Somayaji, Learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the Petitioner and Mr. Prabhu Mukunth Arunkumar, Learned Junior
Standing Counsel appearing for the Respondents and perused the materials
placed on record, apart from the pleadings of the parties.
2\. It is borne out of the materials placed on record that by an order dated
10.09.2001 in Company Petition Nos. 118 and 119 of 2000, the scheme of
arrangement had been sanctioned by this Court in respect of the Petitioner,
viz., M/s. Ponni Sugars (Erode) Limited, with a specific provision entitling
it to claim depreciation in its tax returns on the basis of fair market value
of fixed assets as on 01.04.1999 arrived on the basis of independent valuation
to be undertaken. It is the case of the Petitioner that in furtherance
thereto, the Petitioner had filed return of income tax for the assessment year
2003-2004, but the direction of this Court to provide for depreciation had not
been accepted by the First Respondent in the order dated 22.03.2006 passed
under Section 143(3) http://www.judis.nic.in  2/6 W.P. No. 4542 of 2018 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the 'IT Act' for short). The
appeal preferred by the Petitioner under Section 250 (6) of the IT Act against
that order was dismissed by Order in ITA No. 03/2006-07/CIT(A)-3 dated
29.12.2017 passed by the Second Respondent, which is challenged in this Writ
Petition.
3\. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioner contends that despite
this Court in the order dated 10.09.2001 in Company Petition Nos. 118 and 119
of 2000 having provided for depreciation on the assets of the Petitioner with
the effect from 01.04.1999, the Respondents have refused to extend the said
benefits in the impugned order, which relates to the assessment year
2003-2004. It is further brought to notice that the Assessing Authority while
passing assessment orders in respect of the same Petitioner for the assessment
years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 had declined to
grant the same benefit, which was assailed by the Petitioner in W.P. Nos.
12510 and 12511 of 2004, 12255 of 2006, 3830 of 2007, 1054 of 2008 and 2629 of
2009. This Court by a common order dated 16.10.2020 in that batch of cases
relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Dalmia Power
Limited -vs- Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Circle 1 (Order dated
18.12.2019 in Civil Appeal Nos. 9496-9499 of 2019) held that an
http://www.judis.nic.in  3/6 W.P. No. 4542 of 2018 order sanctioning a scheme
of arrangement pursuant to Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 2013,
will have statutory force, binding on all concerned and the sanction of the
Court would operate as judgment in rem, meaning thereby that the authorities
under the IT Act cannot ignore the benefits conferred under that scheme for
claiming depreciation of assets in tax returns, and had quashed those orders
and remitted the matter to the Assessing Authority for fresh consideration. On
that premise, it is claimed that the Petitioner is entitled to the same
benefit for the assessment year 2003-2004, which was wrongfully denied by the
Second Respondent in the impugned order.
4\. Having regard to the aforesaid submissions made by the Learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, which deserves acceptance, there is no
justification to deny the Petitioner of the same benefit for the assessment
year 2003-2004, which has been granted for the assessment years 2001-2002,
2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 in the order dated 16.10.2020 in
W.P. Nos. 12510 of 2004 etc., batch passed by this Court.
5\. In that view of the matter, the impugned order in ITA No.03/2006-07/
CIT(A)-3 dated 29.12.2017 passed by the Second Respondent and Order in
http://www.judis.nic.in  4/6 W.P. No. 4542 of 2018 PAN/GIR No.
AACCP2779A/52564-P dated 22.03.2006 passed by the First Respondent are set
aside and the matter is remitted to the First Respondent for fresh
consideration. It shall be incumbent upon the First Respondent to take into
consideration the conclusions and observations made by this Court in the order
dated 16.10.2020 in W.P. No. 12510 of 2004 etc., batch, conduct enquiry
affording full opportunity of personal hearing to the Petitioner following the
prescribed procedure in consonance with the principles of natural justice,
deal with each of the contentions raised, and pass reasoned orders on merits
and in accordance with law and communicate the decision taken to the
Petitioner under written acknowledgment.
The Writ Petition is ordered on the aforesaid terms. Consequently, connected
Miscellaneous Petition is closed. No costs.
