KPPNair 28 NMSL 1839/2013 However, the Court restrained the Defendant from
starting any hotel or line of business with a mark that infringes the
registered mark of the Plaintiff.
(ii) Wander Ltd. vs. Antox38 : The facts and circumstances of that case and
present case are totally different and thus reliance placed on the judgment is
irrelevant.
(iii) Schering Corporation vs. Kiltch (Co.) Pharma Ltd. (supra): The test laid
down by the said judgment to refuse injunction on the ground of inordinate
delay of such nature which would disentitle the Plaintiff to the equitable
relief, has not been satisfied by the Defendants in the case at hand. The
reliance placed on the judgment is thus misplaced.
21\. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case in
their favour. The balance of convenience is also in their favour. In view
thereof, pending the hearing and final disposal of the Suit, the ad-interim
order dated 27 th September, 2013, passed by this Court and set out in

        ORDER:
1\. The Plaintiff has filed the present Suit against the Defendants inter alia
for a perpetual order of injunction restraining the Defendants from infringing
the Plaintiff's registered trademark 'MONTINA'. By the present Notice of
Motion, the Plaintiff has sought an order of temporary injunction against the
Defendants from manufacturing and marketing any medicinal preparation/product
by using the mark MONTINA-L.
2\. The Plaintiff is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of
medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. The Defendant No. 2 is carrying on
business in  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 2 NMSL
1839/2013 marketing of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparation in the State
of Gujarat and the Defendant No.1 is the manufacturer of several
pharmaceutical and medicinal preparation of Defendant No.2. In December, 2002,
the Plaintiff (then a Public Limited Company being Aristo Pharmaceuticals
Limited) originally conceived and adopted a trademark being 'MONTINA', to be
used for its medicinal/pharmaceutical preparations. The Plaintiff thereafter
conducted a search and did market survey and did not find any mark which was
identical and/or similar to MONTINA in India or elsewhere. On 31 st December,
2002, the Plaintiff applied for and got the trademark MONTINA registered in
Class 5, for medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. The registration was
granted on 9 th March, 2005 which is effective from the date of application
i.e. 31 st December, 2002. The Plaintiff was subsequently converted into a
Private Limited Company i.e. Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. The Plaintiff's
name as a Private Limited Company is also recorded as the subsequent
proprietor in the Register of Trademarks. The registration of the trademark
was renewed on 31st December, 2012 for a further period of ten years in favour
of the Plaintiff. The registration of the trademark is thus valid and
subsisting.
3\. In June, 2013, the Plaintiff commenced manufacturing of medical
preparation in the form of syrup and tablets which was to be marketed under
the trademark MONTINA. In August, 2013, the Plaintiff commenced selling the
medicinal preparation under the trademark MONTINA-L. Since then the Plaintiff
is selling the said medicinal preparation in tablet as well as syrup form.

4\. Sometime in September, 2013, the Plaintiff came across the Defendants'
medicinal preparation sold under the identical trademark MONTINA-L. On 19 th
September, 2013, the Plaintiff filed the above Suit against the Defendants for
infringement of its trademark and passing off the Defendants' goods as those
of the Plaintiff's by the Defendants' use of the trademark 'MONTINA'. The
Plaintiff also took out the above Notice of Motion seeking ad-interim and
interim reliefs. The Plaintiff apprehended that if the notice of the
application for ad-interim relief is given to the Defendants, the Defendants
will either remove the stock of medicinal preparation bearing trademark
MONTINA-L or flood the market with the pharmaceutical preparation bearing
trademark MONTINA-L. Therefore, an application for ad-interim relief was made
ex parte. On 27 th September, 2013, this Court granted the following ex parte
ad-interim injunction in favour of the Plaintiff:
> "Pending the hearing and final disposal of the Notice of Motion, the
> Defendants by themselves and/or their servants, agents, representatives
> and/or any person(s) claiming under or through them are restrained from
> infringing the Plaintiff's trademark 'MONTINA' under registration No.
> 1162864 in Class 05 in Exhibit A-1 & Exhibit A-2 hereto by adopting and/or
> in any manner using the mark 'Montina-L' or any mark identical with and/or
> deceptively similar to, and/or colourable imitation of the registered
> trademark 'MONTINA' in relation to medicinal and/or pharmaceutical
> preparations or similar goods".
5\. On 2nd October, 2013, Defendant No.2 appeared before this Court and filed
an affidavit in reply to the above Notice of Motion wherein the Defendant No.2
mainly  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 4 NMSL 1839/2013
contended the following:
(i) The trademark 'MONTINA' was invented by Defendant No.2 in the year 2008\.
The prefix 'MONT' is taken from the principal drug 'Montelukast' and 'INA' is
taken from the name of the Company ANIKEM.
(ii) At the time of the adoption of the trademark, the Plaintiff's products
were not available in the market and therefore the adoption is honest.
(iii) Defendant No.2 has spent monies on the sales/promotional activities.
(iv) Since the year 2009, Defendant No. 2 is openly, regularly and extensively
using the trademark 'MONTINA-L' in relation to their medicinal and
pharmaceutical preparations as can be seen from the sales figures provided by
the Defendant No. 2.
(v) Defendant No.2 is selling the medicinal preparation in the market since
2009 and the present Suit is filed by the Plaintiff in the year 2013.
Therefore there is a delay on the part of the Plaintiff in filing the above
Suit.
(vi) The Plaintiff has allowed Defendant No.2 to continue, expand and
consolidate the business under the trademark 'MONTINA'.
6\. The Plaintiff has filed an affidavit in rejoinder denying the aforestated
allegations including the sales figures of the medicinal preparation under the
trademark 'MONTINA-L', as asserted by the Defendant No.2 in their affidavit in
reply.
7\. The submissions advanced before this Court by the Learned Advocate
appearing for the Plaintiff are briefly set out hereunder:

         KPPNair                                         5                                           NMSL 1839/2013   
        7.1                The Plaintiff's trademark validly subsists on the Register of Trademarks 
since 31st December, 2002 and the use of any identical and/or deceptively
similar trademark by the Defendant amounts to infringement of the Plaintiff's
trademark.
7.2 The adoption and/or use of the trademark 'MONTINA-L' by the Defendants is
subsequent to the Plaintiff's said registration of the trademark 'MONTINA'.
The Plaintiff is a registered proprietor of the trademark MONTINA and the use
of identical trademark by the Defendants amounts to infringement of the
Plaintiff's trademark.
7.3 The Defendants' subsequent adoption and/or unauthorized use of its
trademark 'MONTINA' and/or any mark identical with and in any case deceptively
similar thereto is an infringement of the Plaintiff's trademark thereby
violating the Plaintiff's statutory rights to proprietorship and exclusive use
of the trademark in respect of the said goods.
7.4 The adoption and use of the trademark by the Defendant is admittedly
subsequent to the Plaintiff's registration and therefore the defence under
Section 34 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 ("the Act") is not available to the
Defendants.
7.5 The dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Cadila Health Care
Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 1 and the findings/observations of the
Division Bench of this Court in the matter of Bal Pharma Ltd. vs. Centaur
Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and another2 will squarely apply to the present case.
7.6 The reliefs sought by the Plaintiff in the above Notice of Motion
therefore be granted.

8\. The Learned Advocate appearing for the Defendant No.2 during his arguments
advanced the submissions set out in paragraph 5 above. However, when the
written submissions were filed on behalf of Defendant No.2, this Court noticed
that the Defendant No. 2 has traversed far beyond what was either pleaded or
argued before this Court. An incorrect and unhealthy trend of filing written
submissions traversing far beyond what is pleaded or what is argued before the
Court has now set in. Such conduct on the part of a party and/or his Advocate
us most improper and the same is strongly deprecated. However, I have
considered all the submissions made by the parties including the submissions
made on behalf of Defendant No. 2 in its written submissions.
9\. The Defendants have in the affidavit in reply not pleaded that the
Plaintiff's registration is invalid. The Advocate for the Defendants also did
not submit in the course of his arguments that this Court is empowered to go
behind a registration.
However, in the written submissions it has been extensively submitted, relying
upon the judgments of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the other courts, to
contend that the Court can go behind the registration. It is also contended
that the issue whether the Court can go behind the registration has been
referred to a larger Bench of this Court. However, as submitted by the Learned
Advocate appearing for the Plaintiff, it has been the consistent view of this
Court in various judgments that it is not permissible to go behind the
registration of a trademark more so in an interim proceeding and that till the
mark remains on the Register, others ought not to be  ::: Downloaded on -
06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 7 NMSL 1839/2013 permitted to imitate the
same. In the case of Hindustan Embroidery Mills Pvt. Ltd. vs. K. Ravindra and
Co.3 it was held that it is not the practice to consider the validity of the
registration of the trademark on a motion for interlocutory injunction taken
out by a person who has got the mark registered in his name. While the mark
remains in the Register (even wrongly) it is not desirable that others should
imitate it. Similar view has been taken by this Court in (i) Poddar Tyres vs.
Bedrock Sales Corporation Ltd.4; (ii) Biochem Pharmaceuticals vs. Biochem
Synergy5; (iii) Indchemie Health Specialities v. Naxpar Labs6; (iv) Maxheal
Pharmaceuticals vs. Shalina Laboratories 7;
(v) Kores (India) Ltd. v. Whale Stationery Products 8; (vi) Bade Miya vs.
Mubin Ahmed9;
and (viii) ITM Trust vs. Educate India Society10. In the light of the binding
precedents of this Court, the reliance on judgments of the other Courts,
including in the case of Marico Ltd. vs. Agrotech Food Ltd 11, SBL vs.
Himalaya Drug12, Kivi Labs vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals13, Lowenbrau Ag and another
vs. Jagpin Breweries 14, is misconceived.
The mere fact that in the case of Lupin Ltd. vs. Johnson & Johnson 15, the
learned Single Judge of this Court has referred the issue as regards the power
of the Court to go behind a registration to a larger bench, does not in any
manner dilute the binding precedents of this Court till the same are expressly
set aside. It is settled law that 3 (1974) 76 Bom LR 146.

::: KPPNair 8 NMSL 1839/2013 pending a reference, the prevailing judgments
continue to be binding precedents.
9.1 The Defendants have also relied upon the case of M/s. J.K. Sons vs.
Parksons Games and Sports16 (which relies on a judgment of this Court in Abdul
Cadur Alliboy vs. Mahomedally Hyderally17) and has contended that this
judgment is in conflict with the view expressed by the Division Bench of this
Court in Maxheal Pharmaceuticals vs. Shalina Laboratories (supra). It is
submitted that the said judgments i.e. M/s. J.K. Sons (supra) and Abdul Cadur
Alliboy (supra) hold that a person who himself has imitated somebody else's
mark/copyright and is guilty of false and misleading representation is not
entitled to an injunction and the same is applicable to the cases of
infringement of trademark and passing off. However, the Defendants in the
present case have neither pleaded nor proved that the Plaintiff has copied the
trademark of some other manufacturer and therefore the reliance placed on the
judgment of M/s. J.K. Sons (supra) is completely misplaced.
9.2 In the circumstances, the question of going behind the registration of the
Plaintiff's trademark as contended by the Defendant No.2 does not arise.
10\. It is next submitted on behalf of the Defendant No. 2 that though the
Plaintiff got its trademark 'MONTINA' registered since 2002, the Plaintiff has
not used the said trademark until August, 2013. As against this, the Defendant
No.2 has been selling its medicinal preparation in the market since 2009 and

It is therefore submitted that the Defendants being the prior user of the mark
'MONTINA-L', the Plaintiff is not entitled to seek any restraint orders
against the Defendants on the ground of alleged infringement of the
Plaintiff's registered trademark 'MONTINA'.
10.1 In order to deal with the above submission, it is necessary to reproduce
hereunder Section 34 of the Act. The same reads as under:
> "34. Saving for vested rights.-- Nothing in this Act shall entitle the
> proprietor of a registered user of a registered trademark to interfere with
> or restrain the use by any person of a trademark identical with or nearly
> resembling it in relation to goods in relation to which that person or a
> predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trademark from a date
> prior-
(a) to the use of the first mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods by
the proprietor or a predecesssor in title of his; or
(b) to the date of registration of the first mentioned trademark in  :::
Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 10 NMSL 1839/2013 respect of
those goods in the name of the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his;
whichever is the earlier, and the Registrar shall not refuse (on such use
being proved) to register the second mentioned trade mark by reason of the
registration of the first mentioned trademark (emphasis supplied).
10.2 A bare reading of Section 34 of the Act in my view, makes it clear that
in order to avail the benefit of Section 34 of the Act, the use of a trademark
by a person other than the registered proprietor must be prior to the date of
use by the registered proprietor or the date of the registration, whichever is
earlier. Thus, in circumstances where the use by a Defendant is prior to the
use by the registered proprietor, but not prior to the date of registration,
the benefit of Section 34 of the Act is not available. In the present case,
the registration is effective as of 2002 whereas Defendant No. 2 claims to
have used the mark only from 2009. In such circumstances, no alleged right of
the Defendant is saved under Section 34 of the Act.
10.3 As pointed out by the Plaintiff, a similar view was taken by the Division
Bench of this Court (in an Appeal from an ad-interim order) in the matter of
Bal Pharma Ltd. vs. Centaur Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. (supra).
11\. The Defendants have next contended that the trademark of the Plaintiff
has become liable to be removed from the Register of Trademarks under Section
47 (1)  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 11 NMSL 1839/2013
(b) of the Act. The Defendant No.2 has in support of this contention relied on
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of American Home
Products Corporation vs. Mac Laboratories and others18.
11.1 Section 47 (1) (b) of the Act is reproduced hereunder for ready
reference:
> "47. Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-
> use.- (1) A registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect
> of the goods or services in respect of which it is registered on application
> made in the prescribed manner to the Registrar or the Appellate Board by any

> (b) that up to a date three months before the date of the application, a

                  ....                     .....                                  ....         .."
        11.2          From a reading of Section 47 set out hereinabove, in my view  it is clear 
> that the said Section gives a right to an aggrieved person to make an

> originally registered.
11.3 In view thereof the contention of the Defendant No. 2 that the trademark
of the Plaintiff has become liable to be removed from the Register of the
Trademarks under Section 47 (1) (b) of the Act is rejected.
12\. The Defendant No.2 has also contended that they have derived the
trademark MONTINA from the name of a generic pharmaceutical ingredient called
"MONTELUKAST" . It is further contended that the drug was initially developed
at a place called MONTREL. It is contended that since the trademark is derived
from the name of the main ingredient drug, no single manufacturer can claim
monopoly on the generic word. In support of this contention the Defendant No.
2 has relied upon the decisions in SBL Limited vs. Himalaya Drug
Company(supra) and Kiwi Labs v. Sun  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04
::: KPPNair 13 NMSL 1839/2013 Pharmaceuticals (supra).
12.1 As correctly pointed out by the Plaintiff, the Defendant No. 2 in its
affidavit in reply has merely stated as to how it coined the mark MONTINA but
has not raised a specific plea to prove that the mark is generic, and
therefore the Plaintiff does not have a monopoly despite the registration. In
the absence of such a plea, an argument of this nature cannot be raised across
the bar. Again, the very fact that Defendant No. 2 claims that MONTINA is a
coined mark, is a clear admission by them that the same is novel and original.
In any case, this contention is devoid of merit. It is the contention of the
Defendants that they used the word 'MONT' from the name of a generic drug. As
regards the remaining portion of the mark 'INA', the only explanation given by
the Defendant is that it is the reverse form of the first three letters of the
name of the Defendant No.2 i.e. 'ANIkem'. The explanation as to how the
Defendants derived the very name which is absolutely identical to that of the
Plaintiff is not bona fide and does not inspire any confidence. In any event,
as stated hereinabove, once a mark is registered, it is not open to any person
so long as the mark remains on the Register, to contend that the same has been
derived from its generic drug and therefore invalid.
12.2 Applying the aforesaid principle, this Court has in different judgments,
in the context of registered trademarks, dealt with the contention that the
mark has been derived from a generic name. In the case of Wyeth Holdings
Corporation and  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 14 NMSL
1839/2013 another vs. Burnet Pharmaceutical (Pvt.) Ltd. 19, the learned Single
Judge of this Court was considering the case of the Plaintiff, wherein the
Plaintiff alleged infringement of its trademark "FOLVITE" in Class 5. The
Defendant was earlier using the mark FOLCACID which was subsequently changed
to FOLV. The Learned Judge observed thus:
> "18. The contention of the Defendant is that the mark FOLVITE is a
> combination of FOL which stands for folic acid and VIT which is an
> abbreviation for Vitamin. The theory propounded by the Defendant is that the
> Plaintiffs cannot assert a monopoly over folic acid on the one hand and
> Vitamin on the other by adding an "e" to an abbreviation of the two words.
> This argument of the Defendant clearly misses the point and there are
> several reasons why it cannot be accepted. First and foremost, the word
> FOLVITE has absolutely no meaning in the English language. It is an invented
> word. As the Supreme Court observed in Cadila, it is not right to take a
> part of a word and compare it with a part of another. Each word must be
> taken as a whole and compared as a whole with the other. It is not right to
> take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word
> differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case, there
> is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion."
> 19\. Secondly, it is a settled principle of law that so long as a mark
> continues on the Register, it is not open to the Defendant in an action for
> infringement to question the validity of the registration. Sub-
section (1) of Section 31 postulates that in all legal proceedings relating to
a trade mark registered under the Act, the original registration of the
trademark and of all subsequent assignments and 19 2008 (36) PTC 478  :::
Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 15 NMSL 1839/2013
transmissions of the mark shall be prima facie evidence of the validity
thereof. The sequitur of the submission of the Defendant is that the mark of
the Plaintiffs comprises of a generic description of two elements, namely
folic acid and Vitamin, resulting thereby in the mark losing its distinctive
character. During the course of the submissions, however, Mr. Dhond, the
Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant who argued the case with
felicity, submits that the Defendant does not question the distinctive
character of the mark of the Plaintiffs or the validity of the mark. The mark
of the Plaintiffs constitutes a composite invented word and it would not be
open to the Defendant by a process of breaking down the mark to claim that it
is only a combination of common elements. Such an exercise would be
impermissible and so long as the mark continues to be borne on the Register of
Trade Marks, the validity of the mark cannot be questioned."
Relying upon the above judgment, a similar view has been taken by another
Judge of this Court in SMS Formulations Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Santacruz Medical
Stores vs. Sahib Singh Agencies (Bom.) Ltd. and others20 .
12.3 The judgments relied upon by the Defendants in support of its case are
not at all applicable to the present case. The judgment of the Delhi High
Court in SBL Limited vs. Himalaya Drug Company (supra) relied upon by the
Defendant is a judgment in interim proceedings and is reversed at the final
stage. Furthermore, this judgment held that whether such feature is 'publici
juris' or generic is a question of fact. Furthermore, in that case it was
established by documentary evidence that there were about 100 drugs in the
market which had similar abbreviation as prefix 20 2012 (5) Bom CR 858  :::
Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 16 NMSL 1839/2013 or suffix.
In the present case, the Defendant has not even pleaded this ground and no
evidence has been led by the Defendant in this regard. The reliance on the
judgment in Kivi Labs vs. Sun Pharmaceuticals (supra) by Defendant No. 2, is
also completely misplaced and is contrary to the view taken by this Court. It
is submitted that the Plaintiff's trademark is an invented word and as long as
its validity exists on the Register, its validity cannot be questioned.
13\. It is also contended on behalf of Defendant No.2 in its written
submissions that various manufacturers who are manufacturing the 'MONTELUKAST'
drug are using the prefix 'MONT' as a part of their trademark. The Plaintiffs
have correctly contended that the contention of 'common to trade' is a matter
of fact and ought to have been pleaded and proved by the Defendant No.2 in its
affidavit in reply. In the absence of any such plea, it is not permissible to
raise such a plea in the course of arguments. It is further correctly
submitted on behalf of the Plaintiff that an argument of 'common to trade' is
an argument in support of a contention that there is no deceptive similarity
between the two marks and there is no likelihood of any confusion. By raising
a plea of 'common to trade' in arguments, what the Defendants are attempting
to plead is that there are a series of similar marks available in the market
containing common features which results in a consumer to be more discerning
and pay more attention to the features which are different, and this reduces
the likelihood of confusion. This can never be an argument available in
circumstances where the marks are identical. In the present case, both the
marks are identical marks and the plea of 'common to trade' is completely
misplaced and  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 17 NMSL
1839/2013 misconceived.
13.1 In any event, in order to succeed in the defence of 'common to trade',
the Defendants are required not only to plead but also to prove with cogent
material that there are similar marks in the market and the same are in
extensive use. This ratio is laid down in the following judgments:
(i) Corn Products Refining Co. vs. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. 21. It was
held that the series of marks containing the common elements can only assist
the defendant when these marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of
proving such user is of course on the person, who wants to rely on the marks.
(ii) Pidilite Industries Ltd. vs. S.M. Associates and others22:
> "..if a Defendant in a Suit for infringement of its trade mark seeks to rely
> upon the series theory in resisting the claim, he must establish the user
> upon which the objection is founded. It is further held that even in interim
> proceedings, it is not sufficient merely for the Defendant to show prima
> facie that there is some user of the marks. There must be prima facie
> evidence to show extensive use. At the final hearing of the Suit the level
> of proof required is higher - the matter requiring to be proved viz.
> "extensive or substantial use" remaining the same".
13.2 The Defendants have also submitted that the Defendants have been
marketing its products since 2009 and that there has been delay and
acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has submitted that
there is no delay on the part of the Plaintiff in instituting the present
Suit. The Plaintiff has stated that the 21 AIR 1960 SC 142 22 2004 (28) PTC
193  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 18 NMSL 1839/2013
sales figures of Defendant No. 2 are minuscule and which could have hardly
been noticed by the Plaintiff. This Court has noted that the Defendant No.2
has not produced any evidence that it ever advertised its products under the
said mark. In any event, where a party has used a mark in the face of a
registered trademark without even bothering to take search in the Register,
such use is at the Defendants own risk and it is not open to the Defendants to
then raise a contention of delay. I am in complete agreement with the
findings/observations of this Court in the case of Bal Pharma (supra).
Paragraph 11 of the said decision is relevant and reproduced hereunder:
> "11. Then we turn to the question of delay and acquiescence. Mr.
> Tulzapurkar, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent cites the judgment
> of the Supreme Court in Power Control Appliances and Ors.
vs. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd.23 wherein the Supreme Court approvingly referred
to the judgment of the Appeal Court in England in Electrolux LD v. Electrix
and quoted a passage therefrom in paragraph 34 of its judgment. Our attention
was also drawn to the judgment in Electrolux itself. Reference to the judgment
in Electrolux shows that there is no hard and fast rule that delay per se
would defeat an application for interlocutory injunction. The judgment
indicates that in a situation where the defendant to an action has been using
the mark, even if concurrently, without making himself aware of the fact as to
whether the same mark is the subject-matter of the registration and belongs to
another person, the first person cannot be heard to complain for he has been
using it negligently in as much as he has not taken the elementary precaution
of making himself aware by looking at the public record of Registrar as to
whether the mark in question is the property of 23 (1994) 1 SCR 708  :::
Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 19 NMSL 1839/2013 another. If,
however, he had taken search and, knowing full well that the mark was the
property of another person, continues to use the mark, then he runs the risk
of a registered proprietor challenging his action for infringement and merely
because it is done at a subsequent stage, he cannot be heard to complain on
the ground of delay. Further discussion in the judgment shows that in order to
deny an interlocutory injunction, the delay must be such as to have induced
the defendant or at least to have lulled him into a false sense of security to
continue to use the trade mark in the belief that he was the monarch of all he
surveyed. In our judgment, such are not the circumstances here. We are not
satisfied from the record that a search was taken of the registry by the
Appellant to assure itself that there was no other person who owned the mark
"MICRODINE". Assuming that the search was taken, and the Appellant has done it
consciously, then the Appellant has to thank itself for having gambled by
investing large amounts in a risky venture. Either way, we do not think that
the defence can succeed, at this stage, at least."
13.3 In any case, it is settled law that in case of infringement, delay is
never a defence. In Midas Hygine Industries vs. Sudhir Bhatia and others 24,
it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the law on the subject is well
settled. In cases of infringement either of the trademark or of copyright
normally an injunction must follow.
13.4 Again, the concept of acquiescence is very distinct and different from
delay.
Mere delay is never an answer to an action for infringement. In so far as the
plea of acquiescence is concerned, a mere allegation of inaction is not
sufficient. The 24 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC)  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014
04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 20 NMSL 1839/2013 Courts have repeatedly held that
acquiescence requires tacit or express consent;
not merely silence or inaction. This has been repeatedly held by the Courts in
various judgments including in (i) Schering Corporation and Ors. vs. Kilitch
and Co. 25,
(ii) Heinz Italia and another vs. Dabur India Ltd. 26 and (iii) Hindustan
Pencils Pvt.
Ltd. vs. M/s. India Stationery Products Co. and Anr.27 13.5 In Power Control
Appliances and others vs. Sumeet Machines (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court
observed as under:
> "26. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading the rights and
> spending money on it. It is a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim
> for exclusive rights in a trademark, trade name, etc. It implies positive
> acts; not merely silence or inaction such as is involved in laches. It is
> important to distinguish mere negligence and acquiescence. Acquiescence is

> Defendants build upon important trade until it had become necessary to crush
> it, then the Plaintiffs would be stopped by their acquiescence. If the
> acquiescence in the infringement amounts to consent, it will be a complete
> defence"
In the aforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has quoted with approval
the judgment in the case of Willmott v. Barber28(as he then was) at p. 105 and
the following passage therefrom is reproduced hereunder:
"'It has been said that the acquiescence which will deprive a man of 25 1990 1

KPPNair 21 NMSL 1839/2013 his legal rights must amount to fraud, and in my
view that is an abbreviated statement of a very true proposition. A man is not
to be deprived of his legal rights unless he has acted in such a way as would
'make it fraudulent for him to set up those rights'. Let me pause here to say
that I do not understand that, by the word 'fraudulent', the learned Judge was
thereby indicating conduct which would amount to a common law tort of deceit.
'What, then, are the elements or requisites necessary to constitute fraud of
that description?' In the first place 'the plaintiff must have made a mistake
as to his legal rights'. Secondly, the plaintiff must 'have expended some
money or must have done some act (not necessarily upon the defendant's land)
on the faith of his mistaken belief. Thirdly, the defendant, the possessor of
'the legal right, must know of the existence of his own right which is
inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff. If he does not know of
it he is in the same position 'as the plaintiff, and the doctrine of
acquiescence is founded upon conduct with a knowledge' of your legal rights.
Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know 'of the
plaintiff's mistaken belief of his rights. If he does not, there is nothing
which' calls upon him to assert his own rights. Lastly, the defendant, the
possessor of the legal 'right, must have encouraged the plaintiff in his
expenditure of money or in the other acts which he has done, either directly
or by abstaining from asserting his legal right'. In reading that passage, it
is perhaps necessary to note (because it makes it at first sight a little more
difficult to follow) that the positions of plaintiff and defendant as they are
usually met with are there transposed, and that one of the parties who is
there spoken of as the plaintiff corresponds with the present case with the
defendants, and vice versa."
14\. The Defendants have also sought to contend that they have adopted the
::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 22 NMSL 1839/2013
trademark honestly. The Plaintiff has correctly submitted that once a case of
infringement is made out, honest adoption is not a defence available to the
Defendants. The same view was taken by a Division Bench of this Court in
Cadila Pharmaceuticals ltd. vs. Sami Khatib of Mumbai and another 29 where the
Court was considering the question as to whether the Plaintiff's mark "RB
TONE" is being copied by the Defendants as "HB TONE". The Division Bench
observed thus:
> "15. We will assume that the Appellant adopted the mark "Hb TONE" as alleged
> in the affidavit in support. Firstly, even if it did so honestly and
> independently, it would make no difference to the grant of an injunction for
> infringement or passing off once it is held that the mark is deceptively
> similar to the Respondent's mark (See Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. vs.
> Wyeth Holding Corporation, 2005 (30) PTC 14 (Bom) (DB) paragraph 21."
In any case the explanation given for adoption of the mark MONTINA by the
Defendant No.2 completely defeats the contention of honest adoption. It is the
contention of the Defendant No.2 that they used the word 'MONT' from the name
of the generic drug Montelukast. As regards the remaining portion of the mark
'INA', the only explanation given by the Defendant is that it is the reverse
form of the first three letters of the name of the Defendant No.2 'ANIkem'.
The entire explanation as to how the Defendants derived the very same name
which is absolutely identical as that of the Plaintiff is not bona fide and
does not inspire any confidence.
15\. The Defendants have contended that the Plaintiff's registered mark is 29
2011 (3) Bom CR 587  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 23
NMSL 1839/2013 MONTINA whereas the Defendants are using the mark MONTINA-L and
as such the Defendants' mark is not identical or deceptively similar to the
Plaintiff's mark. This is not a contention raised in the affidavit. In fact in
paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Affidavit, the Defendant No. 2 has contended that
their trademark is MONTINA and MONTINA-L. In the absence of such a plea, the
Defendant cannot be permitted to raise this contention in arguments. In any
case, this contention is misconceived in law. In Ruston and Hornby Ltd. vs.
Zamindara Engineering Co. 30, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the
rival marks "Ruston" and "Rustom India" held that the mere fact that the word
'India' was added to the Defendant's mark is of no consequence. In Indchemie
Health Specialities Pvt. Ltd. vs. Naxpar Labs Pvt. Ltd. and another (supra)
this Court has held that if the Plaintiff's mark is entirely incorporated in
the Defendants' mark, the same tantamounts to an infringement of the
registered mark. In Bevit Pharmaceutical ltd. vs. Planned Pharma Pvt. Ltd. and
another 31 while considering the infringement of a mark ATNOL as against a
mark ENTALL-P, this Court held that emphasis placed on the existence of the
suffix 'P' is uncalled for, as suffixes such as these are rarely employed in
speech.
16\. The Defendant No.2 has placed reliance on Section 124 of the Act and
contended that the Suit ought to be adjourned and/or stayed under Section 124
of the Act. Firstly, the Defendants are yet to file their written statement to
the Suit. The Defendants even in the affidavit in reply have not raised the
plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the Plaintiff's
trademark. In such a case, as submitted 30 AIR 1970 SC 1649 : AIR 1970 SC 1649
31 2003 (1) Bom. C.R. 314  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair
24 NMSL 1839/2013 by the Plaintiff, the reliance on Section 124 of the Act is
completely baseless and misconceived and the said provision has no
applicability in the state of pleadings as they stand today. Under Section 124
of the Act, it is incumbent for the Defendants, as contemplated in Section 124
(a) of the Act, to plead that the Plaintiff's trademark is invalid. This is
not even a plea raised by the Defendants. In such circumstances, Section 124
of the Act has no applicability whatsoever. In the light of the aforesaid, the
various judgments relied upon by the Defendants including Astrazeneca UK Ltd.
vs. Orchid Chemicals32, Pfizer Inc. vs. Rajesh Chopra and others 33, BDA Pvt.
Ltd. vs. Paul P. John34, Apex Laboratories vs. Apex Formulations35 and Shakti
Traders vs. Shakti Press36 which are in the context of the power of the Court
to stay the Suit are completely misconceived and inapplicable to the facts of
the present case. In any case, as set out hereinabove, the judgments of the
other Courts run contrary to the settled law as laid down by this Court and
hence would have no applicability to the present proceedings.
17\. The Defendants have also contended that the registration of the trademark
does not give a person a defence against an action for passing off at the
instance of a person who has a vested common law right to the marks. However,
the said contention has no applicability to the facts of the present case
since this is not an action of passing off by the Defendant against the
Plaintiff. This aspect has also been considered by the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Bal Pharma (supra). 32 2006 (32) PTC 733 Del 33 2006 (32)
PTC 301 34 2008 (37) PTC 569, 669 35 2011 (46) PTC 391 36 2008 (5) All M.R.
699  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 25 NMSL 1839/2013
18\. It is further contended by the Defendants that the Defendants are using
the trademark since last six years and have acquired goodwill and/or
reputation which is attached to the trademark MONTINA and/or MONTINA-L in
relation to medicinal preparation and that people have started associating the
said trademark with Defendant No.2 and therefore if Defendant No.2 is
restrained from using the trademark it will cause hardship to the members of
the public. As correctly submitted by the Plaintiff, the said contention is
without any basis. The medicinal preparation which Defendant No. 2 is selling
has not acquired any distinctiveness which can be seen from the sales figures
produced by Defendant No.2. In any case, the said medicinal preparation is not
a patented or a rare drug which will not be found by the public at large. The
contention is thus fallacious. The Plaintiff's products are in any case
available in the market. This contention is also contrary to the Defendants'
own contention that there are various other products available in the market.
In any case, if the Defendants have developed any business by infringing the
Plaintiff's mark, the Defendants cannot take shelter of the plea of public
interest to continue an illegality.
19\. The Defendant No.2 has also contended that the Plaintiff has made
misrepresentation qua the date of user of the impugned mark by the Defendants.
According to the Defendants, the Plaintiff was aware about the use of the
trademark by the Defendants prior to September, 2013. However, the Defendants
have not been able to show anything prior to September, 2013. This plea
therefore cannot be  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 26
NMSL 1839/2013 accepted. In fact, the minuscule sales figures asserted by the
Defendants strengthens the Plaintiff's contention that they were unaware of
the use of the mark by the Defendant.
20\. Lastly, the Defendant No.2 has contended that the balance of convenience
is in their favour. In the instant case, the Defendants have not even bothered
to take search in the office of the Registrar of Trade Marks. The Register of
Trade Marks is open to the public and tantamounts to public notice to any one
who adopts a mark.
If the Defendants adopted an identical mark and in any case deceptively
similar to the Plaintiff's mark then in the face of its presence in the
Register of Trade Mark, the Defendants did so at its own risk and cannot claim
any equity on the basis of such a user.
20.1 The issue as regards the balance of convenience in identical
circumstances was also considered by the Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Bal Pharma (supra) wherein the Hon'ble Court held:
"11. Finally, that brings us to the question of balance of convenience.
Even on balance of convenience, we are of the view that the learned Single
Judge is right. The damage caused to the goodwill of the proprietor of a trade
mark may be intangible and not computable in terms of money, but it has the
long term effect of devaluing the trade mark itself which is the property of
the registered proprietor. Another person, who consciously or without taking
the necessary steps to assure himself of the existence of such a mark, uses it
and invests money therein, does not obviously have the balance of convenience
in  ::: Downloaded on - 06/01/2014 04:10:04 ::: KPPNair 27 NMSL 1839/2013 his
favour. At any rate, at this stage at least, we are satisfied that the
judgment of the learned Single Judge cannot be faulted on the ground of
balance of convenience also. Our attention is drawn to the judgment of
Kurdukar, J. dated 8th March, 1989 in Notice of Motion No. 1920 of 1988 in
Suit No. 2903 of 1986, Pepsico Inc. v. Express Bottlers Services Pvt Ltd. and
Anr., which was confirmed in appeal by the judgment dated 8th February 1991 in
Appeal No. 436 of 1989 by the Division Bench to which one of us (B.N.
Srikrishna, J.) was a party and we stand confirmed in our view."
20.2 In Wyeth Holding Corporation vs. Burnet Pharmaceutical Pvt. Ltd. (supra)
this Hon'ble Court in the context of pharmaceutical products held in paragraph
14-A that where the two competing marks are used for drugs of the same
composition, the same does not justify applying a lower standard of scrutiny,
than what is otherwise done in the case of pharmaceutical products.
20.3 The Defendants in support of its contention of balance of convenience
have relied on certain judgments which are dealt hereinbelow:
(i) Kamat Hotels37 : The facts and circumstances in the said case and the
business of the rival parties in the said case and present case are different.
In that case the Defendant had filed proceedings for rectification of the mark
of the Plaintiff which were pending. It was also found that the annual
turnover of the Defendant in that case was Rs. 140 crores and that the
Defendant had built up substantial reputation and therefore the Court
protected the Defendant against the damage which may result to its existing
enterprise which had a substantial turnover and reputation. 37 2011 (47) PTC

down by the said judgment to refuse injunction on the ground of inordinate
delay of such nature which would disentitle the Plaintiff to the equitable
relief, has not been satisfied by the Defendants in the case at hand. The
reliance placed on the judgment is thus misplaced.
