penalty under Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1994. As the ingredient for
invoking extended period under proviso to Section 73 (1) ibid are identical to
those required for imposing penalty under Section 78 ibid., it follows that
the extended period is not invocable in this case and the finding of the
primary adjudicating authority in para 44 of the impugned order (referred to
above) is totally inconsistent with his finding that penalty under Section 78
is not imposable. It is also pertinent to note that Revenue has not filed any
appeal against the non-imposition of penalty under Section 78 ibid. Also the
impugned demands do not involve extended period in any case and therefore, the
finding in para 44 of the impugned order that extended period of limitation
is applicable in terms of proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance Act is of no
relevance/consequence.
15\. In the light of the foregoing (i) we uphold the impugned order to the
extent it relates to the demand under franchise service.
(ii) We set aside the impugned order to the extent it relates to the demand
under IPR service and remand the case to the primary adjudicating authority

    2.	 Brief facts of the case as duly recorded in the impugned order    are as under:
    (i)	The appellant (M/s Amway India Enterprises Ltd., new Delhi) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amway  Corporation USA which is a large direct selling company. The appellant is registered as a S.T. assessees. 
    (ii)	 It was alleged that  (a) the  appellant had not paid service tax on expenditure incurred in foreign exchange on taxable service namely Intellectual Property Right service received from its associate  enterprises based  abroad and also under Franchisee service on the    income received by it in the form of subscription from various distributors appointed by the company which were given the representational rights to sell the products of the appellant.  All these products bore the various brand names  belonging to the appellant. 
(b) The sale pattern of the company is such that these Amway products are sold
by the distributor directly to the consumers and no product of the company is
available across the counter in any shop or market. Subscription income
basically consists of Joining and Business Fee , Business Renewal Fee and
Back to Future Fee which are briefly described below:
 Joining Fee  Joining Fees is a onetime fee, which is paid as
distributorship charges. The distributor is entitled to purchase the products
only when he pays the joining fees.
Annual Business Fee  Annual Business Fee is allocated on pro rata basis over
a period of one year. The distributor is entitled to purchase the products
only when he pays the fee.
Renewal Fee  Renewal fee is allocated on pro rata basis over a period of one
year. The distributor pays the renewal fee to get its distributorship renewed
for a period of one year.
Income from Back to Future  All such distributors who had discontinued the
distributorship in the past, could again join the business on payment of only
Annual Business Fee.
3\. The adjudicating authority while dealing with the service tax liability
with regard to IPR service held the service tax to be payable there-under
essentially on the basis of its findings in the following paras of the
impugned order:
28. It is seen that the noticees have not disputed that they have received
the taxable services from their associated enterprises and they were liable to
pay Service Tax under reverse charge in term of Section 66A of the Finance
Act, 1994. However, they have made similar contentions that they are liable to
pay service tax on these services only when the payment of these services is
actually made by them . It was further contended that the amendment made in
Section 67 enlarging the meaning of Gross amount charged for associated
enterprises is prospective in operation and would not apply in their
case.These contentions have already been discussed. Accordingly, the demand
raised in the show cause notices secondary & higher education cess on account
of taxable services like Intellectual Property Right Service is liable to be
demanded and appropriated (amount has already been deposited).
29\. Further the noticee contended that they are liable to pay service tax
under Intellectual Property Service of the Finance Act only in respect of
patents and designs which are registered in India. Accordingly, they paid
service tax after claiming 5% deduction from service tax on account of deposit
of R & D cess in terms of Notification No.17/2004-ST dated September 10, 2004.
The noticee was not entitled to the benefit of Notification as the Noticee had
not submitted the documentary evidence in this regard. Further , the interest
also liable to be charged and recovered from them under Section 75 of the Act
ibid.
4\. As regards the impugned demand under franchise service, the adjudicating
authority analysed the provisions of the appellants agreement with the
distributors and concluded that the appellant granted representational right
to sell the goods identified with it (i.e. the appellant) and therefore were
liable to service tax under franchise service.
5\. Regarding the impugned demand relating to IPR service, the appellant has
essentially contended as under:
(i) The impugned order is a non-speaking order inasmuch as it has not dealt
with the following submissions made before the primary adjudicating authority;
(a) it had paid service tax in respect of such IPR service for which they were
registered in India after claiming the benefit of Notification No.17/2004-ST
dated 10.9.2004. (b) It cited the definition of Intellectual Property Right in
Section 65 (55a) of the Finance Act, 1994 which is reproduced below:
 intellectual property right means any right to intangible property, namely,
trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible property , under
any law for the time being in force, but does not include copyright.
Referring to the above definition, it stressed that service tax under IPR
Service was payable on such IRPs which were registered in India. In support of
this contention, it cited Board Circular No.80/10/2004-ST dated 17.9.2004
which clarified as under:
Application of intellect, which may be in the form of an invention, design,
product, process, technology, book, goodwill etc. in India, legislations are
made in respect of certain Intellectual Property Rights (i.e. IPRs) such as
patents, copyrights, trademarks and designs. The definition of taxable service
includes only such IPRs (except copyright) that are prescribed under law for
the time being in force. As the phrase law for the time being in force
implies such laws as are applicable in India, IPRs covered under Indian law in
force at present alone are chargeable to service tax and IPRs like integrated
circuits or undisclosed information (not covered by Indian law) would not be
covered under taxable services.
It argued that as the primary adjudicating authority has not considered its
above submissions, the impugned order is a non-speaking order, that it was not
open to CESTAT now to correct this deficiency in the impugned order and that
consequently the order relating to demand of service tax under IPR service has
to be simply set aside. It cited the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of
Kalyan Singh Chouhan vs. C.P. Joshi  (2011) 11 SCC 786 - wherein it has been
inter alia observed that it is not permissible for the Court to allow the
party to lead evidence which is not in line of the pleadings.
6\. As regards franchise service, the appellant referred to the definition of
franchise given in Section 65 (47) of the Act which is reproduced below:
Franchise  means an agreement by which the franchisee is granted
representational right to sell or manufacture goods or to provide service or
undertake any process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trade mark,
service mark, trade name or logo or any such symbol, as the case may be, is
involved.
It strenuously argued by referring to various provisions of Amways Business
Starter Guide and Distributor Application and Terms & Conditions to stress
the point that while a distributor had right to sell its goods they were not
granted representational right to sell (i.e. appellants) its goods and
therefore there was no franchise service at all. It cited the judgment in the
case of UOI and Another vs. Hansoli Devi and Others  (2002) 7 Supreme Court
Cases 273 wherein it was held that it was not a sound principle of
construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite surplusage,
if they can have appropriate application in circumstances conceivably within
the contemplation of the statute. It also approvingly referred to a case of
Quebec Railway, light Heat & Power Co. Ltd. vs. Vandry AIR 1920 PC 181 wherein
it was observed that the legislature is deemed not to waste its words or to
say anything in vain and a construction which attributes redundancy to the
legislature will not be accepted except for compelling reasons. The judgment
in the case of Global Transgene Ltd. vs. C.C.E. Cus & S.Tax, Aurangabad  2013
(32) STR 86 (Tri-Mumbai) was also cited essentially to stress that right to
sell is different from the representational right to sell. It reiterated that
it had only granted the distributors right to sell goods identified with it
and not the representational right to sell such goods. It referred to the
provisions relating to Franchise in some other countries and the dictionary
meanings of representation or representational.
7\. Ld. A.R. for Revenue on the other hand argued that (i) the non-speaking
order can be set aside only by way of remand and the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Kalyan Singh Chouhan vs. C.P. Joshi (supra) was given in
a different context. He cited the following judgments to the effect that in
the case of non-speaking order, the case has to be remanded to the
adjudicating authority for passing a speaking order:
i) Deepak Agro Foods vs. State of Rajasthan  2008 (228) ELT 510 (SC).
ii) Delhi Public School Society vs. C.S.T., New Delhi  2013 (32) ELT 179
(Tri-Del.).
iii) C.C.E. , Ludhiana vs. Gulab Industries (P) Ltd.  2015 (316) ELT 657 ( P
& H)
(iv) Musashi Auto Paradise Pvt. Ltd. vs. C.S.T., Delhi III  CESTAT Final
Order No.57226 dated 30.7.2013 and
v) Gajanan Fabrics Distributors vs. C.C.E., Pune  1997 (92) ELT 451 (SC).
(ii) It is incorrect to say that IPR service would arise in respect of only
such intellectual property which was registered under an Indian law and that
there is no requirement for registration of intellectual property under an
Indian law in the definition of IPR given in Section 65 (55a) of Finance Act,
1994.
(iii) Ld. A.R. also referred to in detail to Amways Business Starter Guide
and Distributor Application and Terms and Conditions to bring out that the
distributors were granted representational right to sell Amway products.
8\. We have considered the contentions of both sides. As regards the demand
relating to intellectual property service, while the appellant argued that the
service tax was payable (and also paid) in respect of such intellectual
property which was registered in India under an Indian law, the ld. A.R.
argued that there was no requirement of registration in the definition of
intellectual property right [(Section 65 (55a) ibid] and that intellectual
property right can (and does) arise under various Indian laws without any
requirement of such registration and all such intellectual property right
would be covered under the said definition. However, both sides conceded that
the impugned order is a non-speaking order with regard to confirmation of the
impugned demand pertaining to intellectual property service inasmuch as it had
not considered and analysed the various submissions of the appellant before
coming to a finding. Paras 28 and 29 (reproduced earlier) which dealt with the
impugned demand relating to intellectual property are clearly and admittedly
non-speaking. Indeed, the first 6 = lines of the said para 28 are essentially
reproduction of para 18 of the order-in-original No.01-ST/PKJ/CCE/ADJ/2011
dated 31.1.2011 passed in respect of the appellant in a case relating to a
different show cause notice. The said para 28 is also factually misleading
inasmuch as it incorrectly states that the noticees have not disputed that
they have received taxable services from their associate enterprises and they
were liable to pay service tax under reverse charge in terms of Section 66A of
the Finance Act, 1994 Thus both sides have rightly agreed that the impugned
adjudication order relating to the confirmation of service tax demand under
intellectual property service is a non-speaking one.
9\. The appellant has argued that by virtue of the impugned order being
clearly non-speaking in respect of impugned demand under intellectual property
service and it not being open for CESTAT to improve upon the same, the
impugned order in relation to impugned demand under intellectual property
service has to be summarily set aside. In this regard, it placed reliance on
the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Kalyan Singh Chouhan vs. C.P.
Joshi (supra). However, we find that the said judgment deals with the
Representation of People Act, 1951 and was delivered in totally different
context and the Supreme Courts observation (quoted earlier) sought to be
relied upon by the appellant was made in that context. In any case, the said
judgment in no way leads itself to necessarily convey that a non-speaking
quasi-judicial order has to be summarily set aside without recourse to remand.
In the case of Deepak Agro Foods vs. State of Rajasthan (supra) the Supreme
Court held that all irregular or erroneous or even illegal orders cannot be
held to be null and void. In the case of Gajanan Fabrics Distributors vs.
C.C.E., Pune (supra), the Supreme Court remanded the matter to the
Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune because the order passed by the Collector
(as Commissioner was then called) had confirmed the demand made in the show
cause notice upon all seven units and their partners by treating them all as
assessees while the demand ought to have been confirmed only against Gajanan
Weaving Mills which was the assessee and therefore liable. Similarly in the
case of Musashi Auto Parts India Pvt. Ltd. vs. C.S.T., Delhi III (supra) the
Honble CESTAT remanded the case for fresh consideration observing in para 5
thereof as under:
5\. Since the issue as to whether the transfer of technology and know-how by
the Japanese holding company to the assessee fulfils the requirements of
Section 65(105)(zzr) read with the definition of intellectual property Rights
in Section 65 (55 a), has not been considered by the adjudicating authority.
We are of the considered view that it is appropriate to remit the matter for
consideration afresh and grant liberty to the assessee to raise any other
issue as well before the adjudicating authority including as to whether the
provisions of Section 65 (105) (zzr) are applicable to the assessees
transactions, since the payment of royalties event though subsequent were
pursuant to an agreement which was earlier to introduction of the taxable
service. The assessee shall file a Memorandum of Written Submissions within 3
weeks from today before the adjudicating authority on this aspect but shall
not however be entitled to personal hearing again. Any case supporting the
assessees contentions may also be appended to the memorandum of written
submissions, within the time stipulated herein.
Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of C.C.E., Ludhiana vs. Gulab
Industries (P) Ltd. (supra) in effect held that negligence by officers can not
be a ground to allow a delinquent to go scot free and that an order issued in
violation of principles of natural justice should be remanded instead of
allowing the defaulting party to go scot free. In paras 8 & 9 of this
judgment, the P & H High Court observed as under:
8\. We have heard counsel for the parties, perused the impugned order as well
as the order passed by the adjudicating officer and are sanguine, in the case
correctness of our opinion, that the case in hand may disclose collusion, or
to put in politely, negligence on the part of certain officers. It is further
surprising that an officer of the rank of Additional Commissioner, was not
aware that he is required to append all relevant documents with the show cause
notice, and if not appended, to provide copies to the noticee within
reasonable time, before proceeding to adjudicate the show cause notice.
Admittedly, documents were not supplied to the respondent. The negligence does
not end here. The appellant authority granted time to the Department to
furnish documents to the respondent so that it could reply to the show cause
notice but this opportunity also did not elicit any response , compelling the
appellate authority to reverse the order passed by the adjudicating officer
for violation of principles of natural justice.The Tribunal has dismissed the
appeal and the application for restoration , on the ground of violation of
principles of natural justice.
9\. While we find no error in the impugned orders as far as the violation of
principles of natural justice are concerned, we cannot ignore the fact that
negligence or collusion by officers, enjoined with duty to collect taxes,
detect evasion and/or to impose penalties, etc., cannot be a ground to allow a
delinquent to go scot-free. Where an order discloses violation of principles
of natural justice, it is incumbent, while setting aside such an order, to
remand the matter instead of allowing defaulting party to go scot-free.The
appellant authority as well as the Tribunal, while holding that principles of
natural justice have been violated, should have remanded the matter to the
adjudicating officer after serving all relevant documents upon the respondent
to decide the matter afresh. (emphasis added)
10\. Thus in the light of the foregoing discussions and especially in the wake
of judicial pronouncements in the cases of Gajanan Fabrics, Musashi Auto Parts
and Gulab Industries (all mentioned/referred to in the preceding paragraph),
we are of the view that the impugned order to the extent it relates to the
impugned demand under intellectual property service is required to be set
aside and remanded to the primary adjudicating authority with a direction to
pass a speaking order after adverting to submissions of the appellants.
11\. As regards franchise service, the contentions that no word in a statute
is to be treated as redundant, that legislature is deemed not to waste its
words and that each word in a statute has to be given proper meaning is
unexceptionable and accepted. Consequently, we are not making any reference to
various judicial pronouncements cited by the appellant in support of the said
contentions. The appellant also tried to explain to us as to how the word
franchise is understood in some other countries. These sources may be useful
for interpretational purposes in case of ambiguity in the statue, However, the
word franchise is defined in Section 65 (47) of Finance Act 1994 and therefore
any reference to the meaning of the said word in other countries is of no
direct relevance, because for the purpose of this case, we have to go only and
only by the definition of franchise given in Section 65 (47) ibid. Therefore,
it will be pointless to indulge in any analysis with regard to the meaning of
the word franchise in other countries (and in relation to any other Indian law
for that matter). In this regard it is useful to extract below the portion of
para 9 from the judgment in the case of UOI and Another vs. Hansoli Devi and
Others (supra):
 A provision is not ambiguous merely because it contains a word which in
different contexts is capable of different meanings. It would be hard to find
anywhere a sentence of any length which does not contain such a word. A
provision is, in my judgment, ambiguous only if it contains a word or phrase
which in that particular context is capable of having more than one meaning.
12\. It is evident that the only issue involved in the present case to the
extent it relates to the impugned demand under franchise service is whether
the appellant gave to the distributors representational right to sell its
products i.e. products identified with it; the appellant does not dispute that
it gave right to sell products identified with it to the distributors. To
decide this issue, one necessarily has to refer to Amways Business Starter
Guide and Distributor Application and Terms and Conditions. As per the
terms and conditions of distributors, an Amway distributor is also governed by
Rules of Conduct. According to the Business Starter Guide, a distributor is
also known as an Amway Business Owner (ABO). Top 10 Rules prescribed for ABOs
inter alia stipulate that the ABO is to be truthful and accurate in offering
Amway business opportunity or selling Amway products. In other words, an ABO
does not merely sell Amway product but also offers Amway business opportunity.
In terms of Code of Ethics of Amway distributors, the ABO inter alia agrees to
(i) present Amway products and Amway Sales and Marketing Plan to all
prospective distributors. Amway Sales and Marketing Plan as defined in para
2.1.5 of Business Starter Guide means the plan provided in the Amway Business
Starter Guide detailing Amways performance incentive systems, sponsoring
procedures and guidelines, requirements, systems, procedures, and policies
regarding the presentation of Amway products, the Amway business and the
management of an Amway organization, as amended from time to time by Amway and
of which these Rules are a part.
(ii) be courteous and prompt in handling of any and all claims for exchange
and return
(iii) conduct himself in such a manner as to reflect only the highest
standards of integrity, frankness and responsibility because he recognizes
that his conduct as an Amway Distributor has far reaching effects.
As per para 4.1 of the said Guide, a Distributor must adhere strictly to the
guidelines, systems, procedures and policies mentioned in the Amway
literature, the Amway Business Starter Guide of which these Code of Ethics and
Rules of Conduct and Amway Sales & Marketing Plan are a part. Para 4.8 of the
Guide, inter alia, stipulates that Distributor shall comply with all law,
regulations and codes that apply to the operation of their Amway business
wherever said Amway business may be conducted within the market and they must
not conduct any activity that could jeopardize the reputation of the
Distributor and/or Amway. Thus the ABO is not merely having right to sell
Amway product; he also does presentation of Amways Sales & Marketing Plan
which inter alia also includes Amways system, procedures and policies
regarding presentation of Amways products, the Amways business and Amways
organization. The ABO is also required to conduct and behave in the manner
prescribed so as not to jeopardize the reputation of Amway.
As per para 4.13 of the Guide, no distributor shall represent to anyone that
there are exclusive franchises or territories available under the Amway Sales
and Marketing Plan. No distributor shall represent that he or she or anyone
else has the authority to grant, sell , assign or transfer such franchises or
to assign or designate territories. Thus the Business Starter Guide clearly
delineates as to in what respects/aspects the ABO can not represent. In other
words, it follows that it is incorrect to claim that a distributor has not
been granted representational rights to sell products identified with Amway It
becomes further evident from para 8.2 of the said Guide which states that. 
At the first contact with prospective customers and Distributors, a
Distributor should (8.2.1) Introduce himself by name; (8.2.3) As soon as
practicable, he should make himself known in a suitable fashion as an Amway
Distributor and should provide information concerning his name and address as
well as concerning Amway; (8.2.3) Indicate purpose of contact, namely the sale
of Amway Products and/or the introduction of the prospect to the Amway
business(emphasis added).
Thus, at the first contact, the distributor is expected to make himself known
is a suitable fashion as an Amway distributor and provide information
concerning his name and address as well as concerning Amway and the purpose of
contact, including introduction of the prospect to the Amway business. Thus it
again becomes evident that the ABO has been given right to represent Amway
business. Para 12.12 of the Guide also clearly states that if the distributor
makes a serious misrepresentation of Amway or the Amway business which in
Amways opinion, is not likely to be satisfactorily remedied by corrective
actions, then Amway can terminate the authorization to operate as a
distributor. Thus only serious misrepresentation of Amway or Amway business
can lead to termination of distributorship. In other words, he can, indeed
should/ is expected to, represent Amway in accordance with and to the extent
allowed as per the Amways Business Starter Guide and Distributor Application
and Terms and Conditions. In the Sections of the Starter Guide dealing with
Social Media Policy, it is stated (referring to the ABOs) that Remember ,
what you say reflects upon your and Amways reputation. Now Amways
reputation can be affected by what the ABOs says only when he is taken to
represent Amway in some (however limited) capacity.
From the aforesaid analysis of the Amway Business Starter Guide and
Distributor Application and Terms and Conditions, it becomes evident that
ABO/distributor is not merely granted right to sell Amway products but he has
the representational rights to sell such products.
13\. Reference by the appellant to the judgment in the case of New Mangalore
Port Trust Ltd. vs. C.S.T., Mangalore  2012 (26) STR 155 (Tri-Bang.) is
hardly of any avail as that judgment is only an interim order regarding
stay/dispensation of pre-deposit. Reference to the judgment of Mysore High
Court in the case of the State vs. Gangamma (A-4 ) and others  1964 SCC
Online Kar 148 to elucidate the scope of the words on behalf of is also not
of much relevance because these words nowhere appear in the definition of
franchise. Reference to the meaning of the words Represent and
Representational given in Oxford English Reference Dictionary and the Law
Lexicon have been perused. Some of the meanings of represent in Oxford
Dictionary are stand for, corresponds to, be example of, symbolize,
make out, portray be entitled to act or speak for etc. Meanings of the
word represent in Law Lexicon are same/similar to those given in Oxford
Dictionary. The aforesaid meanings of the word represent are in fact far
wider (in scope) than required to hold on the basis of aforesaid analysis that
ABOs clearly had representational right to sell goods indentified with Amway.
The impugned order therefore, cannot be faulted for concluding accordingly on
the basis of the Amway Business Starter Guide, Distributor Application and
Terms and Conditions etc.
14\. In para 44 of the impugned order, the adjudicating authority has held
that  extended period of limitation is applicable in terms of proviso to
Section 73 (1) of Finance Act, 1994. However, we find that the adjudicating
authority in para 49 of the impugned order has observed as under:
49\. The penalty under Section 78 is not leviable as the earlier SCN has been
adjudicated vide Order-in-Original No.01-ST/PKJ/CCE/ADJ/2011 dated 31.01.2011
wherein penalty under Section 78 has been imposed an account of fraud,
suppression and willful misstatement, since these SCNs are for the subsequent
period penalty cannot be imposed under Section 78.
In the wake of the said para 49, the adjudicating authority did not impose
penalty under Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1994. As the ingredient for
invoking extended period under proviso to Section 73 (1) ibid are identical to
those required for imposing penalty under Section 78 ibid., it follows that
the extended period is not invocable in this case and the finding of the
primary adjudicating authority in para 44 of the impugned order (referred to
above) is totally inconsistent with his finding that penalty under Section 78
is not imposable. It is also pertinent to note that Revenue has not filed any
appeal against the non-imposition of penalty under Section 78 ibid. Also the
impugned demands do not involve extended period in any case and therefore, the
finding in para 44 of the impugned order that extended period of limitation
is applicable in terms of proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance Act is of no
relevance/consequence.
15\. In the light of the foregoing (i) we uphold the impugned order to the
extent it relates to the demand under franchise service.
(ii) We set aside the impugned order to the extent it relates to the demand
under IPR service and remand the case to the primary adjudicating authority
for de novo adjudication and passing a speaking order on this aspect after
giving the appellant an opportunity of being heard.

    2.	 Brief facts of the case as duly recorded in the impugned order    are as under:

penalty under Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1994. As the ingredient for
invoking extended period under proviso to Section 73 (1) ibid are identical to
those required for imposing penalty under Section 78 ibid., it follows that
the extended period is not invocable in this case and the finding of the
primary adjudicating authority in para 44 of the impugned order (referred to
above) is totally inconsistent with his finding that penalty under Section 78
is not imposable. It is also pertinent to note that Revenue has not filed any
appeal against the non-imposition of penalty under Section 78 ibid. Also the
impugned demands do not involve extended period in any case and therefore, the
finding in para 44 of the impugned order that extended period of limitation
is applicable in terms of proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance Act is of no
relevance/consequence.
