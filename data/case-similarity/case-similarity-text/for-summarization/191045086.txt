                                आदेश /ORDER
    PER : AMARJIT SINGH, ACCOUNTANT MEMBER:-
This Revenue's appeal for A.Y. 2010-11, arises from order of the CIT(A)-III,
Ahmedabad dated 31-03-2014, in proceedings under section 154 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961; in short "the Act".
2\. The revenue has raised following ground of appeal:-
I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014 A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 2
DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
> "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. CIT(A) has erred
> in law and on facts in directing to compute surcharge and education cess
> after reducing basic tax liability by MAT credit U/S.115JAA of the I T Act."
3\. In this case, return of income declaring income of Rs.
84,89,14,760/- was filed on 08/10/2006. The total tax on the income of the
assesseee was computed at Rs. 25,46,74,428/- as per the provisions of Income
Tax Act. The tax liabilities as per the provision of section 111JB was
determined at Rs. 17,18,54,839/-. The assessee has noticed from the intimation
received u/s. 143(1) of the act that the tax liability has been determined
after providing MAT credit for Rs. 4,61,81,503/- as against MAT credit of Rs.
8,28,19,589/- claimed by the assessee. Therefore, the assessee had applied for
necessary rectification as per the provision of section 154 of the act.
Subsequently, the assessing officer has passed Rectification order u/s. 154 of
the act on 01-05-2012 and provided MAT credit of Rs.
8,28,19,589/- as claimed by the assessee. Thereafter, the assessee preferred
appeal before the ld. CIT (A) against the order of the assessing officer on
the ground that surcharge and education cess has been computed on the tax
payable before reducing the MAT credit and claimed that same should have been
computed after allowing the MAT credit. The ld. CIT(A) has allowed the appeal
of the assessee by observing as under:-
> "9.3. It is seen that assessment year involved in present year is A.Y.
> 2010-2011 and appellant company is required to file its return of income in
> ITR-6 wherein computation of tax liability on total income at Part B-TTI was

I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014 A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 4
DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
4\. During the course of appellate proceedings before us, ld.
departmental representative has vehemently contended that the ld. CIT has
committed error in holding that surcharge and education cess is to be computed
after reduction of MAT credit u/s. 115JAA out of the gross tax payable in the
case of the assessee. He has referred the provision of section 2(43) and
section 4 of the act relating to charging of income tax. He has also contended
that the Finance Act is a part of the Income Tax Act in which rate of income
tax are mentioned in the chapter II. He has also placed reliance on the
judicial pronouncement of the Hon'ble supreme court in the case of CIT vs. K.
Srinivasan 83 ITR 346 wherein the Supreme Court held that surcharge is to be
treated as part of the Income Tax. On the other hand, ld. counsel has
supported the order of the ld. CIT(A) and contended that surcharge are
separate charge and further contended that in case view is taken that tax is
inclusive of surcharge then assessing officer may be directed that the MAT
credit to be given in assessee's case shall also be increased by the amount of
surcharge and education cess applicable to the said income tax. We have heard
both the sides and perused the judicial pronouncements and material on record
placed by both the sides. We have noticed that sub-section (1) second proviso
to sub-section (3), sub-section (11) and sub-section (12) of section 2 of the
Finance Act, 2010 provides as under:-
2\. "1) Subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), for the
assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 2010, income-tax shall be
charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and such tax
shall be increased by a surcharge, for purposes of the Union, calculated in
each case in the manner provided therein."
I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014 A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 5
DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
"provided further that in respect of any income chargeable to tax under
sections 115A, 115AB, 115AC, 115ACA, 115AD, 115B, 115BB, 115BBA, 115BBC, 115E
and 115JB of the Income-tax Act, the amount of income-tax computed under this
sub-section shall be increased by a surcharge, for purposes of the Union,
calculated,--
> (a) in the case of a domestic company, at the rate of ten per cent of such
> income-tax where the total income exceeds one crore rupees;
> (b) in the case of every company, other than a domestic company, at the rate
> of two and one-half per cent of such income-tax where the total income
> exceeds one crore rupees."
" (11) The amount of income-tax as specified in sub-sections (1) to (10) and
as increased by the applicable surcharge, for purposes of the Union,
calculated in the manner provided therein, shall be further increased by an
additional surcharge, for purposes of the Union, to be called the "Education
Cess on income-tax", calculated at the rate of two per cent of such income-tax
and surcharge so as to fulfil the commitment of the Government to provide and
finance universalised quality basic education :
(12) The amount of income-tax as specified in sub-sections (1) to (10) and as
increased by the applicable surcharge, for purposes of the Union, calculated
in the manner provided therein, shall also be increased by an additional
surcharge, for purposes of the Union, to be called the "Secondary and Higher
Education Cess on income-tax", calculated at the rate of one per cent of such
income-tax and surcharge so as to fulfil the commitment of the Government to
provide and finance secondary and higher education"
We have also perused the decision of apex court in the case of CIT vs. K.
Srinivasan 83 ITR 346 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the
surcharge is to be treated as part of income tax. We reproduced the relevant
part of the decision of the Hon'ble court as under:-
"The meaning of the word "surcharge" as given in the Webster's New
International Dictionary includes, among others, "to charge (one) too much or
in addition................"; also "additional tax". Thus, the meaning of
surcharge is to charge in addition or to subject to an additional or extra
charge. If that meaning is applied to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1963, it
would lead to the result that income-tax and super-tax were to be charged in
four different ways or at four different rates which may be described as : (i)
the basic charge or rate (In Part I of the First Schedule); (ii) surcharge ;
(iii) special surcharge ; and (iv) additional surcharge calculated in the
manner provided in the Schedule. Read in this way, the additional charges form
a part of the income-tax and super-tax. It is possible to argue, and that
argument has been commended on behalf of the revenue, that the word
"surcharge" has been used in article 271 for the purpose of separating it from
the basic charge of a tax or duty for the purpose of distributing the proceeds
of the same between the Union and the States. The proceeds of the surcharge
are exclusively assigned to the Union. Even in the Finance Act itself it is
expressly stated that the surcharge is meant for the purpose of the Union.
It would appear that, since the Finance Act, 1943, up to the Finance Act,
1967, a provision was made for taxing the income under the head "Salaries"
according to the provisions of the Finance Act of the preceding year rather
than of the current year if the assessee had any income in addition to his
income by way of salary. According to the Tribunal this was done because if
the  I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014 A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 6 DCIT vs. Intas
Pharmaceutical Ltd.
income under the head "Salaries" was to be assessed at the rates fixed by the
Finance Act enacted for the current year it would entail considerable
administrative work in the form of a refund or collection in the final
assessment. Since by the Finance Act of 1967, this method or procedure was
dropped we do not consider that much significance can be attached to this
aspect. In the result we are unable to sustain the view of the High Court. The
question that was referred must be answered in the affirmative and in favour
of the revenue. In view of the nature of the point involved the parties are
left to bear their own costs in this court. The appeal by certificate is
dismissed."
We have noticed that on the identical issue the hon'ble High Court of Calcutta
has decided the matter in favour of the Revenue in the case of Srei
Infrastructure Finance Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT, Circle-11(2) [2017] 395 ITR
291(Calcutta). The relevant part of the pronouncement is reproduced as under:-
"3. The question raised by the assessee has its route in the form of Income
Tax Return. In other words, the assessee, we are inclined to think, was
probably inspired to raise the issue by the form of income tax return for the
assessment year 2008-09, the relevant portion whereof reads as follows:--
Computation of tax liability on total income 1 Tax Payable on deemed total
Income under section 115JB (7 of Schedule MAT) 1 2 Tax Payable on total income
in item 11 of Part B-TI A Tax at normal rates 2a B Tax at special rates (11 of
Schedule-SI) 2b C Tax Payable on Total Income in item 11 of Part B-TI (2a +
2b) 2c  3 Gross tax payable (enter higher of 2c and 1) 3 4 Credit under
section 115JAA of tax paid in earlier years (if 1 is more than 2c) (7 of
Schedule MATC) 4 5 Tax payable after credit under section 115JAA [(3 - 4)] 5 6
Rebate under section 88E (4 of Schedule-STTR) 6  7 Balance Tax Payable (5-6) 7
8 Surcharge on 7 8 9 Education cess, including secondary and higher education
cess on (7+8) 9 10 Gross tax liability (7+8+9) 10 Portion of the form set out
herein above suggest that the credit under section 115JAA has to be allowed
before addition is made on account of surcharge and cess. The assessee wants
that it should be allowed to do so. The learned Tribunal, however, has held
that:--
"we find no merit in the contention of the assessee that MAT credit should
first be reduced from the tax payable and thereafter on the residual amount
the surcharge and educational cess be levied."
4\. Mr. Khaitan, learned senior advocate submitted that the form of Income Tax
Return prescribed for the year 2008-09, quoted above, continued to hold the
field up to the assessment year 2011-12. It is only for the year 2012-13 that
the form was changed, which reads as follows:--

5\. Mr. Khaitan relied upon the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the
case of CIT v. Vacment India [2014] 369 ITR 304/230 Taxman 18/55 taxmann.com
314, the Division Bench, in that case, solely on the basis of the form of the
Income Tax Return prescribed for the year 2008-09 which continued to hold the
field up to the year 2011-12, answered the issue as follows:-
"The aforesaid entries leave no manner of ambiguity in regard to the method of
computation of tax liability. Entry 3 requires computation of the gross tax
payable. Under entry 4, credit is required to be given under section 115JAA of
the Act of the tax paid in earlier years. Entry 5 requires a computation of
the tax payable after credit under section 115JAA of the Act. The matter is
placed beyond doubt by the parenthesis, which indicates that tax payable under
entry 5 is to be arrived at by deducting the credit under section 115JAA of
the Act (under entry 3) from the gross tax payable (under entry
4). The surcharge is computed on the amount reflected in entry 5."
5.1 Mr. Khaitan drew our attention to Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the
Income Tax Act as it was at the relevant period of time which reads as
follows:-
"Where any Central Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any
assessment year at any rate or rates, income-tax at that rate or those rates
shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and [subject to the
provisions (including provisions for the levy of additional income-tax) of,
this Act] in respect of the total income of the previous year [***] of every
person: Provided that where by virtue of any provision of this Act income-tax
is to be charged in respect of the income of a period other than the previous
year, income-tax shall be charged accordingly."
On the basis of Sub-section (1) of Section 4, Mr. Khaitan contended, that the
Central Act can only provide the rate or rates of applicable income tax. It
cannot also provide for payment of surcharge and cess which is not
contemplated by the Income Tax Act. The surcharge and cess have been imposed
by the Finance Act and, therefore do not amount to income tax.
5.2 He then drew our attention to section 115JAA. He relied upon Sub-sections
(1A), (2A), (4), (5) and (6).
> "(1A) Where any amount of tax is paid under sub-section (1) of section 115JB
> by an assessee, being a company for the assessment year commencing on the
> 1st day of April, 2006 and any subsequent assessment year, then, credit in
> respect of tax so paid shall be allowed to him in accordance with the
> provisions of this section.
> (2A) The tax credit to be allowed under sub-section (1A) shall be the
> difference of the tax paid for any assessment year under sub-section (1) of
> section 115JB and the amount of tax payable by the assessee on his total
> income computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act:
> Provided that no interest shall be payable on the tax credit allowed under
> sub-section (1A) (4) The tax credit shall be allowed set-off in a year when
> tax becomes payable on the total income computed in accordance with the
> provisions of this Act other than section 115JA [or section 115JB, as the
> case may be].
> (5) Set off in respect of brought forward tax credit shall be allowed for
> any assessment year to the extent of the difference between the tax on his
> total income and the tax which would have been payable under the provisions
> of sub-section (1) of section 115JA [or section 115JB, as the case may be]
> for that assessment year.
(6) Where as a result of an order under sub-section (1) of sub-section (3) of
section 143, section 144, section 147, section 154, section 155, sub-section
(4) of section 245D, section 250, section 254, section 260, section 262,
I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014 A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 8 DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical
Ltd.
section 263 or section 264, the amount of tax payable under this Act is
reduced or increased, as the case may be, the amount of tax credit allowed
under this section shall also be increased or reduced accordingly.]"
He wanted us to compare the aforesaid provisions of section 115JAA with sub-
section (1) of section 115JB, which is as follows:--
> "Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act,
> where in the case of an assessee, being a company, the income-tax, payable
> on the total income as computed under this Act in respect of any previous
> year relevant to the assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of
> April, [2007], is less than [ten per cent] of its book profit, [such book
> profit shall be deemed to be the total income of the assessee and the tax
> payable by the assessee on such total income shall be the amount of income-
> tax at the rate of [ten per cent]]"
He submitted that section 115JB provides for payment of income tax at the rate
of 10%. The sub-section (1) does not provide for any payment on account of
surcharge or cess. Similarly, section 115JAA, in particular, the sub-sections
quoted above provide for tax credit to be allowed to the extent of the
difference of the tax paid for any assessment year under section 115JB and the
amount of tax payable by the assessee on his total income computed in
accordance with the other provisions of the Act. By the expression "computed
in accordance with the other provisions of the Act" what is meant is the
normal computation.
5.3 Mr. Khaitan, on the basis of the aforesaid provisions contended that
section 115JB provides for payment of income tax at the rate of 10% and
section 115JAA provides for credit computed on the basis of tax paid and tax
payable. He contended that tax paid has to be the tax calculated under Sub-
section (1) of Section 115JB and payable has to be assessed on the basis of
normal computation without taking into account any surcharge because surcharge
is not chargeable under the provisions of the Income Tax Act.
6\. In support of his submission he relied upon Clause 43 of section 2 which
provides a definition of the word "tax" and does not contain any reference to
any surcharge or cess. Finally, he submitted that the surcharge or the cess
does not alter the rate of tax.
His submissions may be summarized as follows:--
> (a) Surcharge and cess do not fall within the category of income tax. They
> are payable in addition to income tax.
> (b) In calculating the amount of tax payable under Section 115JB the element
> of surcharge and cess cannot be taken into account.
> (c) Similarly in calculating the amount of credit the amount of surcharge
> and cess paid by the assessee are to be excluded.
7\. We have not been impressed by the submissions advanced by Mr. Khaitan for
the following reasons:-
> (a) It was not disputed by Mr. Khaitan that the credit in this case under
> section 115JAA was not claimed by the assessee without taking into account
> the amount of surcharge and cess. Therefore, the submission, which Mr.
> Khaitan advanced, does not match with the facts and circumstances of this
> case.
> (b) We are inclined to think that both surcharge and cess are part of the
> income tax though payable in addition to the Income Tax calculated at the
> rate provided in Section 115JB.
8\. We are supported in our view by Sub-section (1), the second proviso to
Sub-section (3); Sub-section (11) and Sub- section (12) of Section (2) of the
Finance Act, 2008, which provides as follows:--
> "(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) and (3), for the
> assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 2008, income-tax shall
> be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and such
> tax as reduced by the rebate of income-tax calculated under Chapter VIII-A
> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as the

> calculated in each case in the manner provided therein."
Second proviso to Sub-section (3):-
> 'Provided further that in respect of any income chargeable to tax under

> 115E and 115JB or fringe benefits chargeable to tax under section 115WA of
> the Income-tax Act, the amount of income-tax computed under this sub-section

> "Sub-section (11). The amount of income-tax as specified in sub-sections(1)

> All the provisions quoted above speak about income tax being increased by
> the amount of surcharge and cess. Can it in that case be contended that
> surcharge is anything other than Income Tax? We think the answer is 'no'.
9\. It is true that sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Income Tax Act
provides for rate or rates of Income Tax to be stipulated by the Central Act.
If the legislature chooses to realise part of the amount by way of tax and
part of it by way of surcharge and cess thereon rather than providing for a
higher rate to realise the intended amount of tax, can it be said that the
rate of income tax is what appears to have been provided without taking into
account the surcharge and the cess? The answer we think again is an emphatic
'no'. The reason behind increase of income tax by the amount of surcharge and
cess has been spelt out on the basis whereof it can be said that the intention
is that part of the amount realized by way of income tax is earmarked for
being spent in education and higher education.
10\. We are, as such, of the opinion that the view taken by the learned
Tribunal is a correct view. The learned Tribunal has relied on the judgement
of the Apex Court in the case of CIT v. Tulsyan Nec Ltd. [2011] 330 ITR226/196
Taxman 181/[2010] 8 taxmann.com 228. Mr. Khaitan may be right in contending
that the point raised in this appeal did not fall for consideration by Their
Lordships in that judgement. The question which Their Lordships were
considering was whether interest under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C has to be
added to the amount of tax before granting credit under Sections 115JA and
115JAA? Their Lordships answered that question in the negative. The reason is
very obvious. In determining the liability of the assessee the first step has
to be determination of tax payable. The Income Tax Act contemplates self-
assessment by the assessee and quarterly payment of tax in advance and the
rest with the filing of the return. Interest can be realised only for the
amount in default. Interest cannot be charged for an amount which has already
been paid or for which the assessee is entitled to a credit. Before any
question of realising interest may arise the amount of liability on account of
income tax has to be ascertained. In ascertaining the liability, necessarily
the amounts of surcharge and cess have to be taken into account. Once that is
done the amount of tax payable has been ascertained. Then the question arises
for giving credit for the amount of tax already paid in advance or credit
which is statutorily available to the assessee. Only thereafter the question
of any addition on account of interest might arise. This was explained by
Their Lordships.
11\. It is also not correct to say that the judgment in the case Tulsyan Nec
Ltd. [supra] has no application to the facts and circumstances of this case.
In the case before us, the assessee has drawn inspiration from a mistake in
the form of the income tax return. Identical mistake was also involved in the
case of Tulsyan Nec Ltd. [supra]. But that was a mistake with regard to the
calculation of interest and it is on this basis that the claim against the
assessee was raised far in excess of what was payable by the assessee which
was negatived by Their Lordships and they proceeded to hold as follows:--
> "Lastly, it is immaterial that the relevant form prescribed under the
> Income-tax Rules, at the relevant time (i.e. before April 1, 2007), provided
> for set off of the MAT credit balance against the amount of tax plus
> interest i.e. after the computation of interest under section 234B. This was
> directly contrary to a plain reading of section 115JAA(4).
     I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014    A.Y. 2010-11                                                              Page No              10
    DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
> Further, a form prescribed under the rules can never have any effect on the
> interpretation or operation of the parent statute."
No elaborate reasoning is, as such required to show why are we unable to
follow the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Vacment India
(supra) ?
Mr. Khaitan also relied upon a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of CIT
v. Ajanta Electricals [1995] 215 ITR 114/81 Taxman 166. He relied upon the
following view expressed at page 119:--
"Though the rule cannot affect, control or derogate from the section of the
Act, so long as it does not have that effect, it has to be regarded as having
the same force as the section of the Act."
12\. There can be no quarrel with the aforesaid view. But the same has no
application to this case because the form for the relevant year, which
provided inspiration to the assessee to take this point, did in fact seek to
control or derogate from the sections quoted above. That form, as a matter of
fact, was erroneous. That form has subsequently been corrected. Had it not
been a case of a wrong form, the corrected form would in that case be contrary
to law. Our attention was not drawn nor was it contended that the corrected
form is contrary to law. Both the forms, viz. the one which was prevalent at
the relevant period of time and which was corrected for the assessment year
2012-13, could not be the correct forms. If the form of 2012-13 was correct,
then the form of 2008-09 was wrong, and naturally contrary to law.
13\. We, as such, answer the question in the affirmative and against the
assessee.
We have observed that the ld. CIT(A) has decided the matter on the basis from
no. ITR-6 by presuming that income tax payable is to be arrived at by
deducting the credit under section 115JAA of the act (under entry 3) from the
gross tax payable (under entry 4). We are not inclined with decision of the
Ld.CIT(A) in view of specific provision of the Finance Act, 2010 which has
been elaborated as supra in this order. The rate of income tax and surcharge
are charged from year to year as prescribed in the Finance Act. We are of the
considered view that the Finance Act is a part of the Income Tax Act for the
purpose of determining the rate of income tax to be charged from year to year.
The provision of section 2(1) of the Finance Act 2010 read as under:-
> "2. (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), for the
> assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 2010, income-tax shall
> be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and such
> tax shall be increased by a surcharge, for purposes of the Union, calculated
> in each case in the manner provided therein".
We have not find any ambiguity in the aforesaid crystal clear provision of
levying surcharge as provided in the Finance Act . We I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014
A.Y. 2010-11 Page No 11 DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
have not discerned any other specific provision in the act which reads that
the MAT credit u/s. 115JAA has to be provided before computing surcharge and
cess on the taxable income of the assessee. We have noticed that the tax on
the total income of the assessee for the assessment year under consideration
is determined at Rs. 25,46,74,428/- as against the same the assessee claimed
that the same should be determined at Rs. 19,47,11,533/- on the ground that
MAT credit to be provided before charging of surcharge and education cess. We
are of the view that there is no provision in the act which provide this kind
of special incentive of Rs. 5,99,62,895/- in the cases wherein the assesee has
paid MAT in the preceding years. We find that the MAT credit u/s. 115JAA is
only a tax credit which shall be allowed to be set off in a year when tax
become payable on the total income computed in subsequent year according to
the rate of income tax including surcharge and education cess as per the
provision of Finance Act which is a part of the Income Tax Act. In view of the
aforesaid facts and circumstances we find there is no reason that surcharge
and cess can be excluded from the determination of the tax in view of the
specific provisions of the Finance Act, 2010 as elaborated supra in this
order.
The Hon'ble High Court's Calcutta in its pronouncement on the identical issue
as elaborated supra in this order held that the decision of the Ld. CIT(A) to
reduce credit u/s. 115JAA without including the surcharge and education cess
simply on the basis of the ITR form no. 6 is erroneous. It was also mentioned
that such nature of error occurred in the ITR form for assessment year 2008-
     I.T.A No. 1740/Ahd/2014    A.Y. 2010-11                    Page No     12
    DCIT vs. Intas Pharmaceutical Ltd.
09 which was corrected in the subsequent year in the ITR form of assessment
year 2012-13. It is held by the Hon'ble High Court that the wrong form of
ITR-6 was wrong and naturally contrary to law. After considering the facts of
the case and law, the judicial findings as laid down in the judicial
pronouncements as supra we considered that in ascertaining the liability of
tax for the year under consideration the amount of surcharge and cess have to
be taken into account before providing MAT credit u/s. 115JAA of the act. In
view of above we are not inclined with the decision of the Ld. CIT(A) and we
also do not find any merit in the alternative plea of the assessee, therefore
the appeal of the Revenue is allowed.
5\. In the result, the appeal of the Revenue is allowed.

3\. In this case, return of income declaring income of Rs.
84,89,14,760/- was filed on 08/10/2006. The total tax on the income of the
assesseee was computed at Rs. 25,46,74,428/- as per the provisions of Income
Tax Act. The tax liabilities as per the provision of section 111JB was
determined at Rs. 17,18,54,839/-. The assessee has noticed from the intimation
received u/s. 143(1) of the act that the tax liability has been determined
after providing MAT credit for Rs. 4,61,81,503/- as against MAT credit of Rs.
8,28,19,589/- claimed by the assessee. Therefore, the assessee had applied for
