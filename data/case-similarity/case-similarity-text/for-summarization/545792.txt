The word' income' is of the widest amplitude and it must be given its natural
and grammatical meaning. The definition of income in section 2 (24) is
inclusive. The purpose of the definition is not to limit the meaning of'
income' but to widen its net and the several clauses therein are not
exhaustive of the meaning of income; even if a receipt did not fall within the
ambit of any of those clauses, it might still be income if it partook the
nature of income. The words" other games of any sort' were of wide amplitude
and their meaning was not confined to mere gambling or betting activities.
Assuming that the expression" winnings" had acquired a particular meaning viz.
receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature only, it did not
follow that monies received from non- gambling or non- betting activities were
not included within the ambit of income. The assessee participated in a car
rally and won a prize. The car rally was a contest, if not a race and the
assessee entered the contest to win it. What he got was a return for his skill
and endurance. It was" income" construed in its widest sense. Though it was
casual in nature, it was nevertheless income.
