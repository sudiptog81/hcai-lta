is a highly reputed, established and well-known business house having interest
in a very wide range of businesses and activities.
3\. Plaintiff No. 2 is a Company incorporated and registered under the
Companies Act, 1956. Plaintiff No. 2 is the retail trade arm of the Mahindra
Group which focuses on premium lifestyle and retail business stores selling,
inter alia, apparels, toys and furnishings. Plaintiff No.2 has been using the
trademarks "MAHINDRA" and "M & M" under the Name License Agreement dated 9 th
October, 2009, between Plaintiff No.1 and Plaintiff No.2.
4\. Defendant No.1 started as a firm Manhar & Manhar in 1985 and was
incorporated as MNM Marketing Private Ltd. in the year 2004 and Defendant No.2
was incorporated in the year 1989 in the name Mid India Hospital and Research
Centre Private Limited, which changed its name to Mid India Enterprises
Private Limited in 2007.
5\. It is the case of Plaintiff No.1 that it is the registered owner of the
marks "MAHINDRA" (word per se and label), "Mahindra and Mahindra" (word per se

on the official website of the Trade Marks Registry. Exhibit-C at page 42 of
the Plaint, is a copy of the relevant extract from the online records of the
Trade Marks Registry evidencing the same. In the case of Mahendra & Mahendra

        7.
According to Plaintiff No.1, it has been incurring huge expenses in sales
promotion and advertisements in relation to the goods and services bearing the
mark "MAHINDRA", the corporate name "Mahindra and Mahindra Limited" and the
trading style "Mahindra and Mahindra". The statement of the gross revenue
earned and advertisement expenses incurred by Plaintiff No.1 during the years
2005 till 2011, certified by their Chartered Accountant, is annexed and marked
as Exhibit-E at page 53 of the Plaint, which evidences the gross revenue
earned and the advertisement expenses incurred by Plaintiff No.1. It is
further pointed out that Plaintiff No.2 itself, doing retail business with
retail stores, has been incurring huge expenses in sales promotion and
advertisements in relation to the retail services.
The Plaintiff No. 2 has more than 75 stores across India and the sales
turnover of Plaintiff No. 2 runs into crores of rupees.
8\. It is submitted on behalf of the Plaintiffs that "M & M" is the natural
abbreviation/acronym of "Mahindra & Mahindra". The Plaintiffs submitted that
the  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 5 NMS 2191/2012
popularity, goodwill and reputation of the marks "Mahindra"/''Mahindra and
Mahindra'' has become so immense amongst the members of the trade and public,
that the same has naturally flown into and is associated with the term/acronym
of the Plaintiffs "M & M" in any field of business/activity. The said
trademark is used by the Plaintiffs in the course of all their
businesses/activities and the Plaintiffs are known and referred amongst the
members of the trade and public and in press and other media as "M & M" since
at least 1969. It is submitted that the secondary significance, noted by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mahendra and Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. (supra), holds
true even in respect of the abbreviation "M & M" .
9\. It is submitted that the benefit of use and registration of the marks
"Mahindra" and "Mahindra & Mahindra" enures to its natural abbreviation "M &
M"
which has been upheld by this Court (Coram: S.C. Dharmadhikari, J.) in its
order and judgment dated 7th May, 2012 in Notice of Motion No. 1078 of 2012 in
Suit No. 867 of 2012.
10\. It is submitted on behalf of the Plaintiffs that the right of an
abbreviation to have protection from infringement has been recognized by
authors and courts the world over. It is therefore submitted that the said
trademark "M & M" enjoys right of protection against infringement and passing
off. In the instant case, the Plaintiffs have used and registered their
trademark "M & M" and the public also identifies the same as the trademark of
the Plaintiffs and exclusively associates the same with the Plaintiffs. The
Plaintiffs therefore have the exclusive right to use the said trademark "M &
M" both in common law and under the statute by reason of its registrations,
including in particular Classes 35 and 43. The first registration in classes
35 and 42  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 6 NMS 2191/2012
was made as far back as on 16th June, 2006.
11\. The Plaintiffs have complained of the Defendants' impugned mark "M & M" /
"MNM" (''impugned mark'') used by the Defendants for their shopping
mall/retail business which falls within Class 35, as being identical with or
in any event, deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs' trademark "M & M" which
is registered inter alia in Classes 35 and 42. Such use of the impugned mark
constitutes infringement of the Plaintiffs' registered trademark "M & M" and
also results in passing off the Defendants' retail services/business as and
for those of the Plaintiffs.
12\. It is submitted on behalf of the Plaintiffs that the Defendants'
registration of the impugned mark is in several other class in respect of
goods, but not in Class 35 or 42 and use thereof is much after the
registration and use by the Plaintiffs of the said trademark "M & M", and in
any event the Defendants do not have any registration of the impugned mark "M
& M" in Class 35 (for retail trade services) in respect of which the
Defendants are using the same.
13\. The Plaintiffs further submitted that Defendant No. 1 is using the said
trademark as a part of its Company name viz. MNM Marketing Private Limited. It
is submitted that the use of the impugned mark in the trading name/corporate
name constitutes infringement and passing off the Plaintiffs' registered
trademark "M & M".
14\. The Plaintiffs further submitted that the Defendants' registration of the
domain name viz. www.mandmstores.in (impugned domain name) is dishonest and
mala fide. Relying on the decision in Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Sifynet
Solutions Pvt.
::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 7 NMS 2191/2012 Ltd.2, it is submitted that the use of the impugned
domain name by the Defendants amounts to infringement of the Plaintiffs' said
trademark as also passing off.
15\. The Plaintiffs have also submitted that the Plaintiffs learnt about the
impugned activities of the Defendants for the first time in or about January,
2012.
The Plaintiffs sent a cease and desist notice dated 18 th January, 2012,
through their Advocates to which the Defendants replied by their Advocates'
letter dated 30 th January, 2012. It is submitted that the acts of passing off
and infringement by the Defendants are continuing till date. It is submitted
that a strong prima facie case is made out by the Plaintiffs for grant of
reliefs as prayed for by them. The balance of convenience is also in favour of
the Plaintiffs and the Plaintiffs are entitled to the reliefs as prayed for in
the Notice of Motion.
16\. It is pertinent to mention herein that the Counsel appearing for the
Defendants addressed the Court only for about 20 minutes and his main
contentions were that the impugned mark was registered by the Defendant No.2
in certain classes and that there was delay on the part of the Plaintiff in
approaching this Court. Thereafter, as correctly submitted by the Plaintiffs,
the Defendants made improper use of their opportunity to file written
submissions by raising certain contentions/submissions for the first time in
the written submissions, which were neither argued at the hearing nor find
place in their affidavit in reply nor in their sur-rejoinder. Thus these
submissions can straightaway be rejected. However, keeping in mind the
interest of justice and in order not to give an opportunity to the Defendants
to make a grievance that their written submissions were rejected, whilst 2
(2004) 28 PTC 566 (SC)  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 8
NMS 2191/2012 strongly deprecating the above conduct of the Defendants and
their Advocates, this Court has in this order considered all the written
submissions made by the Defendants. In view thereof, an opportunity was also
given to the Plaintiffs to file their further written submissions.
17\. In this background the submissions made on behalf of the Defendants are
now briefly set out hereunder:
(i) That since the impugned mark " M & M"/"MNM" is registered by Defendant
No.1 since 2002 in a few classes viz. Classes 3, 14, 16, 18, 24 and 25, such
registrations are a defence under Section 30 (2) (e) of the Act to the
Plaintiff's case of infringement;
(ii) That the impugned mark is therefore distinctive and hence registered
under Nos. 1121669 in Class 14, 1121670 in Class 16, 1121671 in Class 25,
1121672 in Class 24, 1121673 in Class 18 and 1121674 in Class 03;
(iii) That the impugned mark is used by the Defendants since 2002 and is
therefore protected by Section 34 of the Act;
(iv) That the Defendants are the honest concurrent user of the impugned mark
or are using the impugned mark prior to others on extensive basis. In support
of their contention, the Defendants have relied on Section 12 of the Act;
(v) That the Plaintiffs are not entitled to any reliefs in view of latches and
acquiescence on their part;
(vi) that the Plaintiff's registration in Class 35 is in respect of
advertising, business management, business administration, office functions
and it does not cover 'retail services' and that the Plaintiffs covered their
'retail services' in subsequent trademark  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014
23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 9 NMS 2191/2012 applications filed in the year 2012 and
2013. That the 2006 registration therefore cannot assist the Plaintiffs;
(vii) That the said trademark M &M is not used by the Plaintiffs;
(viii) That the Plaintiffs have no presence in shopping malls, there is no
commonality in the field of activity of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants and
there is a vast difference between the nature of services of the Plaintiffs
and the Defendants;
(ix) That the Plaintiffs have failed to establish dishonesty/unfair advantage
by the Defendants;
(x) That the balance of convenience is in favour of the Defendants;
(xi) That the Notice of Motion therefore deserves to be dismissed.
18\. In rejoinder, the Plaintiffs have submitted as follows:
(i) That the classes under which the Defendants have got the marks registered
pertain only to specific goods and not for services at all. The Defendants do
not have any registration in Classes 35 and 42. The impugned mark " M & M -
Look no Further", the words "Look no Further" have been disclaimed and in any
event are not distinctive. Hence the Defendants' mark is really ' M & M '
only, hence there is no question of the impugned mark being considered as
distinctive to the Defendants;
(ii) That as per Section 28 of the Act, the registration of a trademark shall,
if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trademark the exclusive
right to the use the trademark in relation to the goods or services in respect
of which the trademark is registered. The Defendants do not have any statutory
right in the  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 10 NMS
2191/2012 impugned mark for the services which is the cause of action for the
present case, as they have no registration for services in class 35 or 42 at
all. The Plaintiffs have in support of this contention relied on the decision
of this Court in Balkrishna Hatcheries vs. Nando's International Ltd. and
another3;
(iii) That neither of the two conditions of Section 34, which are required to
be fulfilled in order to afford a valid defence thereunder, is satisfied by
the Defendants.
The Plaintiff has relied on the decision of this Court in Kamat Hotels (India)
Limited vs. Royal Orchids Hotel Limited and another 4 wherein Section 34 of
the Act has been analysed.
(iv) That the Defendants who always had knowledge of the Plaintiffs' mark M &
M cannot be heard to say that the Defendants are the honest concurrent user of
the impugned mark or are using the impugned mark prior to the others on an
exclusive basis. Reliance on Section 12 of the Act is therefore misplaced.
(v) That delay, if any, in approaching the Court does not affect interim
injunction particularly when marks in question are structurally and visually
similar and phonetically identical and that prima facie the adoption of the
impugned mark was itself dishonest. In support of this submission, the
Plaintiffs have relied on the decision in Schering Corporation and others vs.
Kilitch Co. (Pharma) Pvt. Ltd. 5 and Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. vs. India
Stationery Products Co.6
(vi) That the Defendants' contention that the Plaintiffs' registration of the
said trademark in class 35 is from 2008, is incorrect.

        (vii)     That considering that the Plaintiffs' said trademark is prior in point of time 
vis-a-vis the impugned mark and the fact that the Plaintiffs' said trademark
is a well known mark, any subsequent use, howsoever big or small, cannot be a
valid defence.
The Plaintiffs' timeline starts from the date of knowledge and as stated in
paragraph 16 of the plaint, the Plaintiffs became aware of the impugned mark
only in or about January, 2012 and the Plaintiffs have immediately taken
action against the Defendants.
(viii) That the Plaintiffs have filed for the class 35 heading which includes
'services in relation to retail trade' as per the explanatory note of Nice
Classification which was tendered in Court at the hearing. The Plaintiffs have
also relied on Rule 22 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 for this purpose. It is
submitted that this clearly shows that the Plaintiffs registration of 2006
covers the retail services. The subsequent trademark applications made by the
Plaintiffs referred to by the Defendants are not related to the present case,
as those relate to entirely different marks viz. "m&m mahindra retail" and
"m&m mahindra retail our little India coming together".
Therefore, the Defendants contention that the Plaintiffs' registration under
class 35 does not cover retail trade/business is untenable. The Plaintiffs
have also relied on the decision of the Division Bench of the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court dated 8 th February, 2008 in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited
vs. Lachmi Narain Trades and others7 wherein it was inter alia held that,
"dissimilarity in some of the products in which the parties trade does not
make any material difference in so far as the grant or refusal of injunction
against the Defendants are concerned". Relying on Section 29 (4) 7 (MIPR 2008
(1) 0313)  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 12 NMS
2191/2012 of the Act and Section 2 (1) (zg) of the Act which defines well-
known trademark and the Defendants own admission at para 22 page 16 of the
affidavit in reply and para 8 of the affidavit in sur-rejoinder that "M & M"
is an abbreviation of Mahindra & Mahindra, it is submitted on behalf of the
Plaintiffs that the argument of the Defendants that the Plaintiffs have not
registered for 'retail services' in 2006 or that the Defendants are into a
different business will also not hold good.
(ix) That quite independently of infringement, the Plaintiffs have sought
reliefs also on passing off. It is settled law that registration is no defence
to an action for passing off. The Plaintiffs' goodwill and reputation in their
said trademark "M & M"
is sufficiently established by the material produced on record. Relying on the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhat
Shah and another8, it is submitted that assuming for the sake of argument that
there is no dishonesty on the part of the Defendants, still if confusion
results on account of the rival marks, injunction ought to be granted.
(xi) That the Notice of Motion taken out by the Plaintiff be therefore
allowed.
19\. I have considered the submissions on behalf of the Plaintiffs as well as
the Defendants.
20\. The Defendants have not disputed any of the documents annexed to the
Plaintiffs' pleadings. The Plaintiffs' registrations are also not disputed.
Therefore, admittedly, Plaintiff No.1 is the registered owner of the marks
"MAHINDRA" (word per se and label), "Mahindra and Mahindra" (word per se and
label) and "M & M"
(word per se and label) in various classes under the Fourth Schedule to the
Trade 8 AIR 2002 SC 275 paras 10-13  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57
::: KPPNair 13 NMS 2191/2012 Marks Rules, 2002, under the Act. The mark
"MAHINDRA" (word per se and label) is also registered in various countries the
world over, as can be seen from Exhibit-B to the Plaint. As pointed out by the
Plaintiff, the mark "Mahindra & Mahindra" is also listed as a well-known mark
on the official website of the Trade Mark Registry, the relevant extract of
which from the online records of the Trade Marks Registry is annexed as
Exhibit-C to the Plaint.
21\. Section 2 (1) (zg) of the Act defines "well-known trademark" and the same
reads as under:
> "(zg) "well-known trade mark", in relation to any goods or services, means a
> mark which has become so to the substantial segment of the public which uses
> such goods or receives such services that the use of such mark in relation
> to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a
> connection in the course of trade or rendering of services between those
> goods or services and a person using the mark in relation to the first
> mentioned goods or services."
22\. The Apex Court in its decision in the case of Mahendra & Mahendra Paper
Mills Ltd. (supra) has in paragraph 24 upheld that Mahindra & Mahindra is a
well known trademark in the following words:
> "24. Judging the case in hand on touchstone of the principles laid down in
> the aforementioned decided cases, it is clear that the plaintiff has been

> or 'Mahendra & Mahendra' for the purpose of its trade and business.
> Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court cannot be faulted for

In view thereof further rights flow to the Plaintiffs under Section 29 (4) of
the Act.
23\. The details of the registration of the Plaintiffs' trademark "M & M ''
both as word mark and label mark in Class 12, 35 and 42 are set out in
paragraph 6 hereinabove. "M & M" is the natural abbreviation/acronym of
"Mahindra & Mahindra". The Defendants have admitted this in their affidavits
in reply and sur-
rejoinder. A perusal of Exhibits F-1 to F-34 at pages 54 to 90 of the Plaint
which contains specimen news reports of the years 1969, 1972 and 1985 to 2011
shows/establishes that the said trademark "M & M" being a natural abbreviation
of their well known mark "Mahindra and Mahindra", is used by the Plaintiffs in
the course of all their businesses/activities and the Plaintiffs are known and
referred  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 15 NMS 2191/2012
amongst the members of the trade and public and in the press and other media
as "M & M" since at least 1969. Therefore, the popularity, goodwill and
reputation of the marks Mahindra/Mahindra and Mahindra has become so immense
amongst the members of the trade and public that the same has naturally flown
into and is associated with the term/acronym of the Plaintiffs "M & M" in any
field of business/activity. The Plaintiffs are therefore correct in their
submission that the Plaintiff's reputation in "Mahindra & Mahindra" attaches
itself to the acronym/abbreviation 'M & M' which has acquired the character
and quality of a distinctive trade mark itself, both in common law as also the
statutory rights acquired by its registration as set out hereinabove. The
benefit of the use and registration of the marks "Mahindra" and "Mahindra &
Mahindra" enures to its natural abbreviation "M & M". The Plaintiffs are also
correct in submitting that the right of an abbreviation to have protection
from infringement has been recognised by authors and courts the world over. J.
Thomas McCarthy in his commentary "McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition", 2000 Edition (fourth), Volume 1, at paragraph 7 : 18 sets out
several court decisions where it has been indicated that, "where as a result
of use by customers, the trade or by news media, an abbreviation has become
identified in the public mind with a particular company, then that
abbreviation is a protectable trademark, even if the company itself has not
formally used the abbreviation as a trademark." McCarthy goes on to state that
"it is public use that will set the stage for confusion, which is the evil to
be remedied in trademark cases". In my view, therefore, the Plaintiffs have
prima facie established their exclusive right in respect of the mark ''M & M''
both under the Act by virtue of  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 16 NMS 2191/2012 their registrations, and also under common law due to
the extensive reputation therein acquired by them by long, extensive and
continuous use thereof.
24\. The Defendants have contended that since the impugned mark "M & M"
/''MNM'' is registered by Defendant No. 2 since 2002 in few Classes viz.
Classes, 3, 14, 16, 18, 24 and 25, such registrations are a defence under
Section 30 (2) (e) of the Act to the Plaintiffs' case of infringement. It is
further contended that the impugned mark is distinctive and hence is
registered under classes 14, 16, 25, 24, 18 and 03. However, the Defendants do
not have any registration in Classes 35 and 42 wherein their applications are
pending, and have been opposed by the Plaintiffs. It is correctly submitted on
behalf of the Plaintiff that in the impugned mark "M & M -
Look no Further'' the words ''Look no Further'' have been disclaimed and in
any event are not distinctive, hence the Defendants' mark is really ''M & M''
only, hence there is no question of the impugned mark being considered as
distinctive to the Defendants. Section 28 of the Act prescribes that, "the
registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered
proprietor of the trademark the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in
relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trademark is
registered". In view thereof, the Defendants do not have any statutory right
in the impugned mark for services, which is the cause of action for the
present case, as they have no registration for services in class 35 or 42 at
all. Their statutory right is restricted to only those goods in respect of
which their trademark is registered. Section 30 (2) (e) is to the same effect
and the defence or protection available thereunder to the Defendants is
restricted only to the right to use given by virtue of registration. Since the
Defendants' registrations are all in classes other than  ::: Downloaded on -
01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 17 NMS 2191/2012 classes 35 and 42, the use by
the Defendants of the impugned marks in respect of services falling in 35 and
42 is not a right conferred on the Defendants by their registrations and hence
is not protected under Section 30 (2) (e) of the Act. In Balkrishna Hatcheries
(supra), this Court has noted the distinction between goods and services, and
marks registered for goods on the one hand and for services on the other. The
Court has held that registration of a trademark in relation to goods cannot
support the use of that mark in respect of services and vice versa. In the
present case, the Defendants have registration of their mark in respect of
goods only and not for services. Hence, their registrations cannot afford
protection when their mark is used in respect of services. Therefore, an
infringement suit does lie against the Defendants, as the Defendants'
registrations are not in respect of services in classes 35 and 42 and the
registrations in respect of goods in other classes cannot be a defence to a
suit based on the Plaintiffs registrations in classes 35 and 42.
25\. As regards the contention of the Defendant that the impugned mark was
used by them since 2002 and is therefore protected by Section 34 of the Act,
two conditions need to be fulfilled to afford a valid defence thereunder to
the Defendants. The Defendants' use must be prior (a) to the use of the first
mentioned trademark in relation to those goods or services by the proprietor
or a predecessor in title of his; or (b) to the date of registration of the
first-mentioned trademark in respect of those goods or services in the name of
the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; whichever is earlier. Both
the above conditions are not satisfied by the Defendants. Further in the case
of Kamat Hotels (India) Ltd. vs. Royal Orchids Hotels  ::: Downloaded on -
01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 18 NMS 2191/2012 Ltd. and another9 , this
Court has analysed Section 34 of the Act and laid down the conditions to be
satisfied to raise a defence of prior use of the trademark. On the facts of
this case, the Plaintiffs' use of their trade mark "M & M" is from 1969, as
established by the material on record. The Plaintiffs' registration of "M & M"
in class 12 is of 1998 and in classes 35 and 42 is of 2006. The Defendants'
own application for impugned mark ''M & M look no further '' in Class 35
claims use from 1 st January 2002 and for the impugned mark ''MNM'' claims use
from 17 th March 2007. These applications are at Exhibit-B-7 page 37 and
Exhibit-C pages 40 and 41 to the affidavit in reply of the Defendants. Thus,
on the Defendants' own showing, their use of ''M & M'' from January 2002, is
subsequent to the Plaintiffs' use of ''M & M'' from 1969. The Defendants' use
of ''MNM'' is claimed in the Defendants' own registration application to be
from 17 th March, 2007. Again, this is subsequent both to the Plaintiffs' use
of ''M & M'' from 1969 and the Plaintiffs' registration from 2006 in classes
35 and 42. Therefore, neither condition of Section 34 is satisfied by the
Defendants. Their contention under Section 34 therefore cannot be accepted.
26\. The submission of the Defendants that they are the honest concurrent user
of the impugned mark also cannot be accepted. The Plaintiffs are in the
business since last several decades and it is inconceivable that the
Defendants were unaware of the said trademark of the Plaintiffs when they
adopted the impugned mark. The Plaintiffs said trademark is a well known mark.
Therefore, the long prior existence of the Plaintiffs' said trademark ''M &
M'' is to the Defendants' knowledge, and makes the Defendants a subsequent
adopter of an identical and/or deceptively 9 2011 (47) PTC 111 (Bom.)  :::
Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 19 NMS 2191/2012 similar
impugned mark. The Defendants' adoption cannot be said to be honest at all. It
is also not concurrent, as the Plaintiffs' use of their mark ''M & M'' is from
1969\. The Defendants have offered no valid justification for adopting the
impugned mark, particularly the ''&'' , other than to cash in on the
Plaintiffs' goodwill in the said trademark, ''M & M''. The Defendants
therefore cannot be considered to be honest concurrent users in relation to
their impugned mark.
27\. The Defendants have contended that the Plaintiffs are guilty of gross
delay and acquiescence in filing the present Suit. The Defendants have also
relied on various news articles wherein the impugned mark is being featured.
The Plaintiffs have correctly contended that considering that the Plaintiffs'
said trade mark is prior in point of time vis-à-vis the impugned mark and the
fact that the Plaintiffs said trademark is a well known mark, any subsequent
use, howsoever big or small, cannot be a valid defence. The Plaintiffs'
timeline starts from the date of knowledge and as stated in paragraph 16 of
the Plaint, the Plaintiffs became aware of the impugned mark only in or about
January 2012 and the Plaintiffs have immediately taken action against the
Defendants. The Plaintiffs, by placing reliance on the decision of this Court
in Schering Corporation and others vs. Kilitch Co. (Pharma) Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) and the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High
Court in Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. vs. India Stationery Products Co.
(supra), have correctly submitted that it is settled law that delay in any
event does not affect an interim injunction, particularly when the marks in
question are structurally and visually similar and phonetically identical and
that prima facie the adoption of the impugned  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014
23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 20 NMS 2191/2012 mark was itself dishonest. Hence, this
contention of the Defendants cannot be accepted and is rejected.
28\. The Defendants also contended that the Plaintiffs registration of the
said trademark in class 35 is from 2008. This is incorrect. From the material
placed on record it is clear that the Plaintiffs have registered their said
trademark viz. M & M (logo) in the year 2006 and not in the year 2008. The
logo is composite and contains the words ''M & M'' also, which is an essential
part of the registration and has to be taken into consideration for comparison
of the rival marks. Moreover, the said trademark is registered in Class 12 way
back in the year 1998. Exhibit-A at pages 37 to 39 of the Plaint is a list
containing the details of applications/registrations of the marks ''MAHINDRA''
(word per se and label), ''Mahindra and Mahindra'' (word per se and label) and
said trademark '' M & M'' in various classes in India. The details set out
therein have not been disputed by the Defendants.
29\. The Defendants have contended that the Plaintiffs' registration in Class
35 is in respect of "advertising, business management, business
administration, office functions" and that Class 35 does not include retail
services. It is submitted on behalf of the Defendants that it is for this
reason that the Plaintiffs covered their retail services in subsequent
trademark applications filed in the year 2012 and 2013.
This submission of the Defendants also cannot be accepted. The Plaintiffs have
pointed out that the Plaintiffs have filed for the Class 35 heading which
includes 'services in relation to retail trade' as per the explanatory note of
the Nice  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 21 NMS 2191/2012
Classification. The International Classification of Goods and Services for the
Purposes of the Registration of Marks (Nice Classification), Ninth Edition,
Part-1 with List of Goods and Services in Alphabetical Order in its
explanatory note with respect to Class 35 categorically sets out as under:
> " Explanatory note:
> ..... .....
> This excluding Class includes, in particular:
> the bringing together, for the benefit of others, of a variety of goods (the
> transport thereof), enabling customers to conveniently view and purchase
> those goods; such services may be provided by retail stores, wholesale
> outlets, through mail order catalogues or by means of electronic media, for
> example, through web sites or television shopping programmes".
The Plaintiffs have also correctly relied on Rule 22 of the Trade Marks Rules,
2002, for this purpose which is reproduced hereunder:
> "22. Classification of goods and services.-
(1) .... ..... ....... .....
(2) The goods and services specified in the Fourth Schedule only provide a
means by which the general content of numbered international classes can be
quickly identified. It corresponds to the major content of each class and are
not intended to be exhaustive in accordance with the international
classification of goods and services. For determining the classification of
particular goods and services and for full disclosure of the contents of
international classification, the applicant may refer to the alphabetical
index of goods and services, if any, published by the Registrar under Section
8 or the current edition of the International Classification of Goods and
Services for the purpose of registration of trademark published by the World
Intellectual Property Organisation or  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57
::: KPPNair 22 NMS 2191/2012 subsequent edition as may be published."
These clearly show that the Plaintiffs' registration of 2006 covers retail
services. The subsequent trademark applications made by the Plaintiffs and
referred to by the Defendants are not related to the present case as those
relate to entirely different marks viz. ''m&m Mahindra retail'' and ''m&m
Mahindra retail our little India coming together...". Therefore, the
Defendants' contention that the Plaintiffs' registration under class 35 does
not cover retail trade/business is untenable. The Plaintiffs' mark is
registered in class 35 in respect of retail trade/business. In fact the
Defendants who are contending to be using the impugned mark for shopping malls
have not made a single application for 'shopping malls'.
30\. The Division Bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court by its decision dated
8 th February, 2008 in the case of Larsen and Toubro Limited (supra), whilst
allowing the appeal and restraining the Defendants/Respondents therein from
using the trademark/names LNT/ELENTE or other deceptively similar name in
relation to any of its products inter alia held that, " ..Once the learned
Single Judge came to the conclusion that the word 'landt' or ELENTE are
associated with the plaintiff's goods and have acquired a definite and
distinct reputation amongst the buyers, there was no justification for
allowing the defendant to make use of the said words or any word or words
phonetically similar to them. This was especially so when the learned Single
Judge had recorded a specific finding to the effect that the adoption of the
abbreviation LNT by the defendant was not bona fide no matter the defendants
name may be  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 23 NMS
2191/2012 Lachmi Narain Trades and LNT/elente an abbreviated form thereof". It
was further held in the above case that, "Dissimilarity in some of the
products in which the parties trade does not make any material difference
insofar as the grant or refusal of injunction against the Defendants are
concerned".
Further, as per Section 29 (4) of the Act, "A registered trade mark is
infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using
by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which (a) is
identical with or similar to the registered trade mark; and (b) is used in
relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the
trade mark is registered; and (c) the registered trade mark has a reputation
in India and the use of the mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of
or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the registered
trade mark". Again as per Section 2 (1) (zg) of the Act, "well-known trade
mark, in relation to any goods or services, means a mark which has become so
to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or receives
such services that the use of such mark in relation to other goods or service
would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade
or rendering of services between those goods or services and a person using
the mark in relation to the first mentioned goods or services".
In the present case, as already stated hereinabove, the Defendants themselves
have admitted at paragraph 22 at page 16 of the affidavit in reply and
paragraph 8 of the affidavit in sur rejoinder that "M & M" is an abbreviation
of Mahindra & Mahindra.
Therefore, in the aforesaid circumstances, the argument of the Defendants will
also not hold good. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mahendra & Mahendra Paper
Mills  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 24 NMS 2191/2012
Ltd. vs. M and M Auto Industries Limited (supra) has observed that, ''Mahindra
& Mahindra'' is a well known trade mark and that the mark ''Mahindra &
Mahindra '' has acquired secondary significance. Since ''M & M'' which is only
a natural abbreviation, has also been used since 1969, the reputation of
Mahindra & Mahindra will enure to and attach to its natural abbreviation and
the abbreviation itself in the normal course will be a well-known mark. Under
Section 29 (4), the use of the impugned mark by the Defendants in respect of
dissimilar goods or services also constitutes infringement of a well known
trademark. Any use of the impugned mark by the Defendants in respect of any
goods or services will constitute infringement of the Plaintiffs registered
trademarks. There are no bona fides in the Defendants' use of the impugned
mark. Also, its use will certainly be detrimental to the distinctive character
of the Plaintiffs' registered trademark inasmuch as it will get diluted and
its indiscriminate use will lead to its destruction.
31\. The Plaintiffs are also entitled to seek relief on the ground of passing
off. As correctly submitted by the Plaintiffs, it is settled law that
registration is no defence to an action for passing off. The Plaintiffs'
goodwill and reputation in their said trademark "M & M" is sufficiently
established by the material produced on record.
The Plaintiffs' use of "M & M" is long prior to that of the Defendants.
Secondary significance has been acquired by the Plaintiffs' said trademark.
Therefore, any use of "M & M" by the Defendants will inevitably lead to an
association of the Defendants' goods and business with those of the
Plaintiffs. Damage will result thereby to the Plaintiffs' reputation.
::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 25 NMS 2191/2012
32\. The Defendants contend that the said trademark ''M & M'' is not used by
the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have produced material in the plaint showing
use of the said trademark since 1969. The Plaintiffs are not only dealing in
vehicles but also in retail trade and other services falling in class 35.
Plaintiff No. 2 is the retail trade arm of the Mahindra Group which focuses on
premium lifestyle and retail business stores selling, inter alia, apparels,
toys and furnishings. Plaintiff No. 2 has been using the trademark
''MAHINDRA'' and ''M & M'' under the Name License Agreement dated 9th October,
2009, between Plaintiff No.1 and Plaintiff No.2. Plaintiff No.2 is itself
doing retail business with retail stores, and has been incurring huge expenses
in sales promotion and advertisements in relation to the retail services as
mentioned at paragraph 13, page 9 of the Plaint. Plaintiff No. 2 has more than
75 stores across India and the sales turnover of Plaintiff No.2 runs into
crores of rupees. In any event, the said trademark of the Plaintiffs being a
well known trademark under Section 29 (4) of the Act, the alleged difference
in goods and services of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants is immaterial.
Reliance placed by the Plaintiffs on the judgment of this Court in Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. vs. M and M Auto Industries Ltd. (Notice of Motion No. 1078 of
2012 in Suit No. 867 of 2012) at paragraph 26, is apposite.
33\. The Defendants contended that the Plaintiffs have no presence in shopping
malls, there is no commonality in the field of activity of the Plaintiffs and
the Defendants and that there is vast difference between the nature of
services of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants. Considering that the
Defendants' impugned mark is  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 26 NMS 2191/2012 identical with/deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs'
registered said trademark and the impugned mark is used for similar services
as that of the Plaintiffs, the presumption under Section 29 (2) of the Act,
that the same is likely to cause confusion or association with the registered
trademark also applies here. Even otherwise, the Plaintiffs have made out a
strong prima facie case. Therefore the Defendants' contention that there
cannot be any confusion as the impugned mark is used in relation to shopping
malls, which is alleged to be different from the goods/services covered by the
Plaintiffs' said trademark and/or registration, cannot be accepted.
34\. The Defendants contended that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish
dishonesty/unfair advantage by the Defendants. This is incorrect. Assuming
that the Defendants wanted to coin a mark based on their promoters name,
Manhar Manhar;
the Defendants could have adopted any other mark instead of M & M, for the
adoption of which by them they have offered no valid explanation, particularly
when they had knowledge of the Plaintiffs' well known said trademark.
Furthermore, the Defendants' dishonest intentions are apparent from the fact
that Defendant No. 1 was incorporated in 2004 with the corporate name as MNM
Marketing Pvt. Ltd.
Assuming that there is no dishonesty on the part of the Defendants, still if
confusion results or is likely to result on account of the rival marks,
injunction ought to be granted. Reliance has been placed by the Plaintiffs on
Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhat Shah and another (supra) which states that
dishonest intention is not necessary to be shown by the Plaintiffs.
::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 27 NMS 2191/2012
35\. Further, Defendant No. 1 is using the said trademark as a part of its
Company name viz. MNM Marketing Private Limited. The use of the impugned mark
in the trading name/corporate name when the Defendants are using it for
business/activity similar to that for which the Plaintiffs' mark are
registered, constitutes infringement and also, in any event, passing off. The
Defendants also, cannot take recourse to Section 35 of the Act as Section 35
relating to the saving for use of name does not apply to artificial person
like an incorporated company. This has been held by the Bombay High Court in
Kirloskar Diesel Recon Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Kirloskar Proprietary Ltd.
and others10.
36\. The Plaintiffs have contended that the Defendants' registration of the
domain name viz. www.mandmstores.in (''impugned domain name'') is dishonest
and mala fide. It is correctly submitted by the Plaintiffs that the domain
name not only serves as an address for Internet communication, but also
identifies the specific Internet site as the address of its owner and also has
trademark value. The consumer would be misled into thinking that the
defendants' goods/services are those of the Plaintiffs and/or related to the
Plaintiffs. The domain name serves the function of a trademark and is not a
mere address and is therefore entitled to equal protection as a trademark. Use
of the impugned domain name by the Defendants amounts to infringement of the
Plaintiffs' said trademark as also passing off. The reliance by the Plaintiffs
on the Supreme Court judgment in Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Sifynet Solutions
Pvt. Ltd.11 is apposite. The Defendants' use and registration of the 10 AIR
1996 Bom. 149 at paragraph 17 11 (2004 (28) PTC 566 (SC) at paragraphs 11-15
and 23  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 ::: KPPNair 28 NMS 2191/2012
impugned domain name containing the words ''M & M'' cannot be permitted.
37\. The Defendants have relied on various orders/judgments without giving any
reference to the point of law in support of which the said orders/judgments
have been cited. However, the said orders/judgments are not of any assistance
to the Defendants as they are not relevant to the present case and the same
have been distinguished hereunder:
(i) Bhavesh Mohanlal Amin and another vs. Nirma Chemicals Works and another
12:
The said judgment is in relation to use of rival marks with respect to
unrelated goods. The present Suit is in relation to rival marks with respect
to related services and hence the said judgment is not applicable to the
present case.
(ii) Sterling's Mac Fast Food vs. McDonald's Corporation, U.S.A. Anr .13: The
said judgment is not applicable in the present case as it is in relation to
completely different facts and point of law as compared to the present case.
The judgment is based on delay and acquiescence and such pleas have not been
raised at any time by the Defendants in their pleadings or arguments, nor have
the Defendants produced any evidence in respect of the same. Moreover, the
said judgment would not hold good in light of the decision of this Court in
Schering Corporation and others vs. Kilitch Co. (Pharma) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and
the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in Hindustan
Pencils Pvt. Ltd. vs. India Stationery Products 12 2006 (1) SCC 185 13 ILR
2004 KAR 2893: 2004 (4) KarLJ 612  ::: Downloaded on - 01/08/2014 23:49:57 :::
KPPNair 29 NMS 2191/2012 Co. (supra) relied upon by the Plaintiffs, wherein it
is held that delay in any event does not affect the grant of an injunction.
(iii) Raymond Limited vs. Raymond Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. 14: The said
judgment is not applicable in the present case as it is in relation to the use
of a trademark only as a Corporate name and thus in relation to Section 29 (5)
of the Act, whereas, in the present case, the Defendants have used the
trademark also as a mark in relation to services in addition to its use as a
corporate name. The present suit thus attracts inter alia Section 29 (1),(2)
and (4) of the Act.
(iv) Goenka Institute of Education & Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka and
others 15:
The said judgment relates to Section 12, prior use and Section 34 of the Act.
As enunciated hereinabove, Section 12 is not applicable as there is no honest
concurrent use of the impugned mark by the Defendants. The Defendants' alleged
user of the impugned mark is admittedly subsequent to the Plaintiffs and in
any event, the Defendants' adoption of the impugned mark is dishonest. Also,
as stated hereinabove, the Defendants have not satisfied the conditions of
Section 34 of the Act. In fact, paragraphs 17 and 19 of the said judgment
strengthen the case of the Plaintiffs.
38\. In view of the aforestated circumstances, the Defendants are guilty of
infringing the Plaintiffs' said trade mark "M & M" and are also guilty of the
acts of 14 2010 (44) PTC 25 (Bom.) (DB) 15 FAO (OS) No. 118/2009 Delhi High
