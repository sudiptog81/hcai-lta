JUDGMENT U.K. Sharma, Chairman
1\. This petition has been filed under Section 50 of the Copyright Act lor the
rectification of the Copyright Register by expunging Registration No. A
8141/72 made in the name of the respondents.
2\. The Petitioner is Hindustan Lever Limited a company duly incorporated
under the Companies Act. The petitioner states that the trade mark and
artistic logo LUX was created for and adopted by Lever Brothers Limited of
Port Sunlight, Cheshire, England and was registered as a trade mark in 1931
before the Registrar at Calcutta. A label bearing the trade mark was also
registered in 1931. Both were extensively and continuously used by Lever
Brothers Limited. In 1934 Lever Brothers Limited assigned the trade mark LUX
as well as the label in favour of Lever Bros. (India) Limited which was a
company incorporated in India. In 1956 Lever Bros. (India) Limited adopted a
new name Hindustan Lever Limited. Thus, the LUX trademark and the label for
LUX toilet soap became the property of the present petitioner. All these
registrations and assignments arc sought to be proved by An-nexure-A,
unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the
original."
35\. Our conclusions are thus based on the proposition laid down by the
Supreme Court. Following the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in R.G.
Anand v. Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613 : PTC (Suppl)(1) 802(SC) and by the
Delhi High Court in Prem Singh's case, AIR 1990 Delhi 223 : 1990 PTC 149
(Del), and applying them to the present case we hold that the work which has
been registered in the name of the respondent is subsequent in point of time
and that of the petitioner is anterior. The time span between them is very
long-covering more than 50 years. The petitioner's work was widely advertised
and used and was visible even to the common man much before 1972 when the
respondent obtained registration. The Respondent had plenty of opportunity to
copy the work. Looking and comparing the two works and applying the test of
the average man we conclude that the basis, material and substantial features
are the same in both the works. Hence the work of the respondent is but a
copy. It is not an original work and has no claim to be retained in the
registrations and assignments arc sought to be proved by An-nexure-A,
Annexure-B, Annexure-C and Annexure-D is evidence of change of name of Lever
Bros. (India) Limited.
3\. The petitioner claims that on the basis of the registration of trademark
and label and their due assignment in its favour it is the proprietor of the
trademark LUX and owner of the copyright in the original artistic work
containing the LUX logo as represented and displayed in Annexure-A. It also
claims to have an exclusive right to use and produce the same in any material
form under Section 14 of the Copyright Act, 1957.
4\. The petitioners submits that the Respondent, M/s Bishwanath Hosiery of
Tagorc Street, Calcutta has fraudulently and by suppressing material facts
obtained registration of copyright in the impugned artistic work titled LUX
under Copyright Registration No. A-8141 of 1972. The Registration has been
given as Annexure E to the petition. It is stated by the petitioner that the
impugned level is a colourable and slavish imitation of and substantial
reproduction of the original artistic work belonging to the petitioner.
5\. The petitioner submits that by a perusal of the two labels it would be
evident that the Respondent has copied the LUX logo of the petitioner and
thereby committed infringement of the copyright of the petitioner as defined
in Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957. The Respondent as well as its
proprietor Shri Giridhari Lal Todi has made a misrepresentation and committed
fraud upon the Registrar of Copyright by claiming that the impugned logo and
label were an original artistic works authored and designed by Shri Giridhari
Lal Todi.
6\. The petitioner has in the petition submitted that it has objected to the
use of the trademark LUX by the Respondent in relation to under-garments and
has taken steps to oppose such use including filing opposition to the
trademark application No. 463993 in class 25. It has also taken steps to seek
rectification of Trademark Registration No. 281016 in class 25.
7\. The petitioner further states that the adoption and use of the impugned
trade mark LUX by the respondent is solely motivated to earn easy and illegal
profits by causing confusion and deception among the members of the public and
the trade leading to passing off their goods for those of the petitioner. The
confusion or deception is inevitable since the goods of the petitioner, viz.
toiletries and those of the respondents are cognate and allied in nature, and
are sold through common trading channels and across the same selling counters.
8\. The petitioner states in the petition that register should be rectified
because the impugned work is not an original work but is a substantial and
fraudulent reproduction of LUX logo of the petitioner.
9\. The petitioner prays that the Copyright Registration No. A-8141/72 be
infringed.
10\. The respondents filed a detailed written statement. In the written
statement it is stated that the petitioner has no locus standi to maintain the
petition. Their first ground is that Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the petitioner) and
Lever Brothers Limited are distinct legal entities and that the petitioner
cannot prosecute the case for Lever Brother Limited. They also deny the
registration of the trade mark in favour of Lever Brothers Limited. It is also
stated that the registration is no more valid. It is also denied that the logo
was registered with the registrar at Calcutta on 1st April, 1931. It is slated
that such registration does not confer any right, title or interest in favour
of Lever Brothers in respect of the art work or artistic design within the
artistic logo.
11\. The Respondent deny that the logo is an original artistic work and that
no skill has been applied by the author of the logo. It is stated that it is a
mere reproduction of the word LUX in cross stitch pattern.
12\. The Respondent do not admit that toilet soap packed in LUX label was
marketed in India since 1931. They further deny that the LUX label was
advertised and it acquired any goodwill and reputation in India. They also
deny the assignment of the label and logo infavour of Lever Brothers (India)
Limited. The Respondent deny all that has been included in the petition and do
not admit the validity of the registration of various LUX trade marks in
favour of the petitioner or its predecessor.
13\. The respondents states that the impugned artwork is not a colourable or
slavish imitation of the petitioner's work and it has not committed
infringement of copyright. The respondent has pointed out the differences
between its artwork and that of the petitioner. It has denied having committed
fraud or misrepresentation. The respondent has stated that it is using the LUX
mark since 1957 and got registration for it as a trademark in 1972 for goods
belonging to class 25.
14\. The petitioner have filed an affidavit in rejoinder and also an affidavit
by one of Shri Ashok Gupta, Genera] Manager supported by some documents. One
of the documents is a declaration filed on 2nd October, 1905 before a notary
public at Liverpool, England in regard to the use of LUX trade mark. Another
document of 1931 contains a representation of the LUX label. The rejoinder
states that the trade mark LUX is an invented mark, well known nationally and
internationally having a formidable goodwill and reputation. The petitioner
has also submitted he certificate of incorporation and change of name. The
petitioner has submitted a statement showing yearwise sales turnover and
advertisement expenses of LUX mark from 1935 to 1984. In 1984 the
advertisement expenses in India were Rs. 71,78,000 and the sales turn over in
India was Rs. 84,92,91,000/- in 1991 they were Rs. 22,43,396,000 and
3,67,17,000 respectively. A number of advertisements published by the
petitioner have been annexed. They show the LUX mark made in a distinctive
manner it has enclosed a copy of some portions of a magazine covering a
programme sponsored by the petitioner and also displaying the LUX Trade mark
in preceding years. It has also submitted three certificates showing sales
turn over and advertisement expenses from two firms of Chartered Accounts. The
petitioner has also filed an affidavit of Shri Alan J. Almeida an Ex Employee
aged about 75 years in support of its various contentions.
15\. The respondents did not file any affidavit in support of their case.
16\. The Board heard the arguments of both the parties on the 9th November,
2000 at Panaji, Goa, but did not pass any order. The present Board was
constituted on 22nd February 2001. The Board therefore listed the matter for
its sitting on 27th June, 2001. On that date the counsel for the petitioner
was present. The Respondent did not attend the hearing. The advocate for the
Respondent sent a Communication to the Registrar of the Copyright Board. In
the communication it took the plea that fixing the case for hearing was
illegal and asked the Registrar to communicate to the respondent the order
passed by the Board and further asked the registrar not to proceed with the
hearing of the matter.
17\. The Board thought it fit to give one more opportunity to the Respondent.
In the order passed on that day it was clearly stated that no final order was
pronounced by the earlier Board. The order was duly communicated to the
Respondent In order to expedite disposal the matter was listed for 6th
September, 2001. On that day the Respondent again chose to be absent.
18\. The Board therefore decided to pronounce order on the basis of written
submissions. This was communicated to both the parties.
19\. The Respondent did not submit written arguments. The matter was listed
again for the sitting on 1st November, 2001, thus, the respondent was given 3
opportunities to presents its case orally or in writing either in person or
through an advocate.
20\. The Respondent again wrote a letter on the 25th October, 2001 to the
Registrar to communicate the order of the Board.
21\. We would like to record that the communications received from the
Respondent use language and contain threats which arc unbecoming to say the
least. Instead of writing nasty letters it could have very well appeared
before the Board and presented its case. It failed to understand this simple
situation that had the earlier Board passed an order the case would have been
finally disposed.
22\. It was evident that the Respondent is unwilling to appear to give written
submissions. The matter was fixed for his benefit on 3 occasions viz. 27th
June, 2001, 6th September, 2001 and 1st November, 2001.
23\. In the circumstances the Board had no choice but to decide on the basis
of the petition, the written statements and the evidence before it.
24\. The Board has carefully gone through the record to ensure that the party
which has not appeared before it is not placed at a disadvantage.
25\. From the pleadings it emerges that the petitioner has been using the
trade mark LUX which was registered in its name in India on 1.4.1931. Hence,
the petitioner is an aggrieved person and has a right to more the Board.
26\. The trade mark LUX with crisscross pattern comprising black and while
squares to form the three letters which spell LUX was registered with the
Registrar at Calcutta on 1st April 1931. The trade mark has been in use by
Lever Brothers Limited even before the 2nd day of October 1905. This is
evidence by the declaration made on that date in England which is duly
notarized.
27\. The petitioner has furnished the deed showing assignment of the trade
mark LUX and the LUX label by Lever Brothers Limited to Lever Brothers (India)
Limited on 29th November, 1934. Later with effect from 1st November, 1956 the
company Lever Brothers (India) Limited acquired a new name viz. Hindustan
Lever Limited, This name still continues. The change was duly permitted under
the Companies Act, 1956. Thus, the trade mark LUX and the LUX label and many
other trade marks became the property of the present petitioner.
28\. The LUX mark was registered in India on the 9th Oct. 1943 under the Trade
Marks Act, 1940 in the name of Lever Brothers (India) Limited. It has been
regularly renewed and the last renewal on record before us in the name of the
petitioner was made in 1994.
29\. The petitioner has submitted copies of numerous advertisements and an
article published in a magazine "Hamara" which show and establish that the
brand LUX was introduced in India in 1929 featuring a film star Ginger Rogers.
In 1941 the first Indian actress endorsed it. Her name was Leela Chitnis.
Since then advertisement showing the face of a film star alongwith the
endorsement are regularly being published by the petitioner. The petitioner
has submitted certificates from 3 firms of Chartered Account certifying the
LUX turnover and the amount spent on advertisement during every financial
year. In the year 1991 the amount spent on advertisement on LUX was
3,67,17,000/- in 1997 the expenditure was 19,73,40,000/- which is not a small
sum.
30\. Thus, the petitioner has been able to prove that is the proprietor of the
mark LUX and the label LUX drawn in a particular cross stitch or crisscross
pattern, that it is being used by the petitioner and its parent and
predecessor companies since at least 1905, that it is registered as a mark in
its name under the Trade Marks Act and that it is spending big sums to keep
the mark alive and within the notice of the public.
31\. LUX according to the dictionaries is a unit of illumination. It has no
other meaning. It may even be taken to be a coined word like Kodak or Dalda.
The manner in which LUX is written appears to be unique. It is made of small
squares. All lines are straight. None is curved. Usually U is written with set
curves. But in the LUX mark the letter U is formed by straight lines. Each
letter has a proportionate thickness. The thickness is filled with small
squares. Usually three squares cover the thickness. Out of which one is of
different shade. In the length also alternate squares are of different shades.
Thus, it may concluded that LUX is an original artistic work and deserves
protection under section of the Copyright Act, 1957.
32\. The respondent too is entitled to seek protection if he is able to
establish that the LUX mark that it has got registered under the Copyright
Act, 1957 is an original artistic work. On visual examination, it is noticed
that the respondent has employed the square assembling technique to build the
three letter of LUX. The respondent uses three building blocks to form the
thickness. Alternate squares bear a different shade. The respondent has not
given any reason for selecting the word LUX which does not carry any meaning.
The Respondent has selected the word LUX because it must have come across the
numerous advertisements, labels, wrappers and hoardings displayed by the
petitioner. The design and pattern of the formation of the letters leads to
only one conclusion - that it is based on or copied form the LUX mark owned by
the petitioner.
33\. The Respondent got the registration in its name in the year 1972 at a
time when Section 45 was not amended by Act 23 of 1983. At that time the law
did not require the application for registration to be accompanied by a
certificate from the Registrar of Trade Mark that no mark identical with or
deceptively similar to such artistic work has been registered under that Act,
in the name of any person, other than the applicant. The Delhi High Court has
in Prem Singh v. Ceeam Auto industries, AIR 1990 Delhi 223:1990 PTC 149 (Del),
applied the principle of the amending Act of 1983 to the case before it.
Adopting the same principle and applying it to the present case the LUX mark
would not have been certified by the Registrar of Trade Mark because of the
registration of the LUX Trade Mark with the Registrar of Trade Marks. Thus in
view of the judgement of the Delhi High Court the mark LUX does not deserve to
remain in the Copyright Register. We have also been guided by the observations
made by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand v. Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613; PTC
(Suppl)(1) 802(SC). The court had observed in para 15.
"It is also clear that it is not necessary that the alleged infringement
should be an exact or verbatim copy of the original but its resemblance with
the original in a large measure, is sufficient to indicate that it is a copy."
34\. In the present case it is clearly established that LUX mark was used
since 1905 and its spelling, form, contours, colours and composition were for
everyone to be seen. The respondent got his mark registered in 1972. The long
span of years between the first year of its use by the petitioner and its
registration by the Respondent leaves title room for doubt. The conclusion
that it is a copy or imitation becomes inevitable. The respondent has copied
the material and substantial features of the LUX trade mark. The variations
are minor. The copy comes so near to the original that if a person looks at
the registered work of the Respondent his mind would immediately recollect the
LUX mark and label used by the petitioner. The two works are to be compared
from the point of view of an average consumer. He would have neither the time
nor the disposition to make a line by line or stroke by stroke comparison of
the two works. His examination would not be meticulous. Hence, minor
dissimilarities are to be discounted. The effect produced on the person who
sees the mark of the respondents the test of its being a copy or original. The
Supreme Court has laid down in R.G. Anand v. Dulux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613:
PTC (Suppl) (1) 802(SC) para 46.
"One of the surest and safest test to determine whether or nor there has been
a violation of Copyright is to see if the reader, spectator or the viewer
after having read or seen both the works is clearly of opinion and gets an
unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the
original."
35\. Our conclusions are thus based on the proposition laid down by the
Supreme Court. Following the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in R.G.
Anand v. Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613 : PTC (Suppl)(1) 802(SC) and by the
Delhi High Court in Prem Singh's case, AIR 1990 Delhi 223 : 1990 PTC 149
(Del), and applying them to the present case we hold that the work which has
been registered in the name of the respondent is subsequent in point of time
and that of the petitioner is anterior. The time span between them is very
long-covering more than 50 years. The petitioner's work was widely advertised
and used and was visible even to the common man much before 1972 when the
respondent obtained registration. The Respondent had plenty of opportunity to
copy the work. Looking and comparing the two works and applying the test of
the average man we conclude that the basis, material and substantial features
are the same in both the works. Hence the work of the respondent is but a
copy. It is not an original work and has no claim to be retained in the
Register.
36\. Accordingly it is ordered that the Register of Copyrights be rectified by
expunging the work Registered with Registration No. A-8141/72 in the name of
Gridhari Lal Todi, proprietor of M/s. Biswanath Hosiery.
unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the
original."
35\. Our conclusions are thus based on the proposition laid down by the
Supreme Court. Following the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in R.G.
Anand v. Delux Films, AIR 1978 SC 1613 : PTC (Suppl)(1) 802(SC) and by the
Delhi High Court in Prem Singh's case, AIR 1990 Delhi 223 : 1990 PTC 149

registrations and assignments arc sought to be proved by An-nexure-A,
Annexure-B, Annexure-C and Annexure-D is evidence of change of name of Lever
Bros. (India) Limited.
3\. The petitioner claims that on the basis of the registration of trademark
and label and their due assignment in its favour it is the proprietor of the
trademark LUX and owner of the copyright in the original artistic work
containing the LUX logo as represented and displayed in Annexure-A. It also
claims to have an exclusive right to use and produce the same in any material
form under Section 14 of the Copyright Act, 1957.
4\. The petitioners submits that the Respondent, M/s Bishwanath Hosiery of
Tagorc Street, Calcutta has fraudulently and by suppressing material facts
obtained registration of copyright in the impugned artistic work titled LUX
under Copyright Registration No. A-8141 of 1972. The Registration has been
given as Annexure E to the petition. It is stated by the petitioner that the
impugned level is a colourable and slavish imitation of and substantial
reproduction of the original artistic work belonging to the petitioner.
5\. The petitioner submits that by a perusal of the two labels it would be
evident that the Respondent has copied the LUX logo of the petitioner and
thereby committed infringement of the copyright of the petitioner as defined
in Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957. The Respondent as well as its
