The word' income' is of the widest amplitude and it must be given its natural
and grammatical meaning. The definition of income in section 2 (24) is
inclusive. The purpose of the definition is not to limit the meaning of'
income' but to widen its net and the several clauses therein are not
exhaustive of the meaning of income; even if a receipt did not fall within the
ambit of any of those clauses, it might still be income if it partook the
nature of income. The words" other games of any sort' were of wide amplitude
and their meaning was not confined to mere gambling or betting activities.
Assuming that the expression" winnings" had acquired a particular meaning viz.
receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature only, it did not
follow that monies received from non- gambling or non- betting activities were
not included within the ambit of income. The assessee participated in a car
rally and won a prize. The car rally was a contest, if not a race and the
assessee entered the contest to win it. What he got was a return for his skill
and endurance. It was" income" construed in its widest sense. Though it was
casual in nature, it was nevertheless income.

CHARGE. CHAPTER II BASIS OF CHARGE
4. Charge of income- tax 1
(1) Where any Central Act enacts that income- tax shall be charged for any
assessment year at any rate or rates, income- tax at that rate or those rates
shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and 2 subject to the
provisions (including provisions for the levy of additional income- tax) of,
this Act] in respect of the total income of the previous year] of every
person: Provided that where by virtue of any provision of this Act income- tax
is to be charged in respect of the income of a period other than the previous
year, income- tax shall be charged accordingly.
(2) In respect of income chargeable under sub- section (1), income- tax shall
be deducted at the source or paid in advance, where it is so deductible or
payable under any provision of this Act.
1\. Substituted for' subject to the provisions of, this Act" by the Direct Tax
Laws (Amendment)' Act, 1987, w. e. f. 1- 4- 1989. This amendment was
consequent to the insertion of Chapter XIV- B (comprising of section 158B),
but after the withdrawal of the chapter, without even coming into effect, this
amendment too needs to be undone.

Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, w. e. f. 1- 4- 1989.
liability arising from contracts as well as torts. it would be incorrect to
assume that the share of an assessee in a form consists only of income
yielding assets. It equally comprises of risk and liability of paying debts on
behalf of the firm. An assessee cannot, under the Hindu law make a declaration
whereby the joint family would have to bear the risk and liability of the
business and such a declaration should be ignored altogether. 6 Where payment
is made to compensate for the loss of the use of any goods in which the
assessee does not carry on any business or the payment is a just equivalent of
the cost incurred by the assessee, but excess accrues due to fortuitous
circumstances or is a windfall, then ccrual may be a receipt, but it would not
be income arising from business, and, therefore, not taxable under the Act. 7
In the hands of an assessee, who maintains his accounts on the mercantile
system, sales tax collected but not paid to the Sales Tax Department pending
adjudication of dispute over his liability to pay sales tax, is a revenue
receipt of the year in which it is collected. 8 Where a company goes into
liquidation and the liquidator distributes the assets of the company among the
shareholders, what each shareholder gets is in lieu of his shareholding. That
is the worth, the value and the price of his shareholding. A shareholder
participates in the distribution of the assets of a company on its liquidation
by virtue of and because of his shareholding. It is true that a liquidator
does not sell the shares. It is equally true that there is no transfer of
shares by the shareholder to the liquidator or to any other person. That is
not really necessary. So long as money is received in lieu of shares, there is
a receipt and where an assessee is a dealer in shares, any surplus amount
received by him constitutes his income. The money received by the assessee in
lieu of its shareholding partakes of the same character in which he held the
shares. If he held the shares as stock- in- trade, the money received by it
represents his income i. e. a revenue receipt in its hands. If it held them by
way of investment, the money it receives represents a capital receipt by it.
5. Scope of total income 1
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the total income of any previous
year of a person who is a resident includes all income from whatever source

outside India shall not be so included unless it is derivedfrom a business

only of the fact that it is taken into account in a balance sheet prepared in
India. Explanation 2.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that
income which has been included in the total income of a person on the basis
that it has accrued or arisen or is deemed to have accrued or arisen to him
shall not again be so included on the basis that it is received or deemed to
be received by him in India.

Code

property (known under the Portuguese Civil Code of 1860 as" COMMUNIAO DOS

Where a foreign agent of Indian exporter operates in his own country and no
part of his income arises in India and his commission is usually remitted
directly to him and is not received by him or on his behalf in India, the
agent is not liable to income- tax in India on the commission. A non- resident
will not be liable to tax in India, on any income attributable to operations
confined to purchase of goods in India for export even though the nonresident
has an office or agency in India for this purpose. Where a non- resident
allows an Indian customer facilities of extended credit for payment there
would be no assessment merely for this reason provided that the contracts to
sell were made outside India and the sales were made on a principal to
principal basis. Section 9 does not seek to bring into the tax net the profits
of a non- resident which cannot reasonably be attributed to operations carried
out in India. Even if there be a business connection in India the whole of the
profit accruing or arising from the business connection is not deemed to
accrue or arise in India. It is only that portion of the profit which can
reasonably be attributed to the operations of the business carried out in
India which is liable to income- tax.
5 The mere existence of an agency, established by a non- resident in India,
will not be sufficient to make the non- resident liable to tax, if the sole
function of the agency is to purchase goods for export. 6 Where shares in
Indian companies are allotted in consideration for the machinery and plant,
the income embedded in the payments would be received in India as the shares
in the Indian companies are located in India and would accordingly attract
liability to income- tax as income received in India.

impartible estate, where such sum has been paid out of the income of the
estate belonging to the family;
(2A) 2 in the case of a person being a partner of a firm which is separately
assessed as such, his share in the total income of the firm. Explanation.- For

capital gains arising from the transaction in acquiring the new capital asset,
the amount of capital gains so utilised would be regarded as having been
applied to the charitable or religious purposes of the trust. 6 While under
section 11 (1) (a) the tax will be levied in the year to which the income
relates, under section 11 (3) the income would be chargeable in the year in
which the amounts cease to be accumulated for the specific purpose mentioned.
Thus when amounts are taxed under section 11 (3) the benefit which would have
been available to a trust in respect of 25 per cent of its income or Rs. 10,

the accounts plus its other income will be the income of the trust for

income and not accumulate more than 25 per cent thereof. Excess accumulation
if any will become taxable under section 11 1. 9 Donations received by a

gardeners, night watchman and sweepers provided by the employer should be
calculated on an ad hoc basis as given in Letter No. 40 25 69, dated 8- 6-
1971 (reproduced below) only when the services of sweeper are provided by the
employer, i. e. the sweeper is recruited by the employer and remunerated by
him but his services are placed at the disposal of the employee. 2 Rent- free
accommodation.- While determining the fair rental value of an accommodation
owned by the company, the cost of acquisition and other capital expenses on
renovation, etc. incurred by the company should be taken into account. In
respect of premises taken on lease or rent by the company the actual payment
by the company should be taken as fair rental value of the premises. 3
Reimbursement of medical expenses.- The value of the perquisite arising by way
of payment or reimbursement by an employer of expenditure on medical treatment
incurred by his employee on himself or on his spouse, children or parents
including the provision of free medical treatment or treatment at a
concessional rate will not be included in the taxable salary of the employee
in the following cases:
(i) where the medical treatment is availed at hospitals, clinics, etc.
maintained by the employer;
(ii) where the medical treatment is availed at hospitals maintained by the
Government or local authorities or hospitals approved for the purposes of CGHS
or the Central Medical Scheme;
(iii) where the expenditure is on medical insurance premia;
(iv) where the medical treatment is availed of from any doctor outside the
institutions schemes mentioned above, an expenditure of upto Rs. 10, 000 in a
year in the aggregate; and
(v) where the medical treatment is availed of in a hospital outside India and
the expenditure is incurred for treatment including on travel and stay abroad
in connection with such treatment, as also on travel and stay abroad of one
attendant, to the extent permitted by RBI subject to the condition that the
amount qualifying for such tax exemption would not include expenditure
incurred on travel in the case of employees whose gross total income as
computed without considering the amount paid or reimbursed for expenditure in
connection with medical treatment exceeds Rs. 1 lakh. 4 Rent- free residential
accommodation.- Keeping in view the steep escalation in rents, it has been
decided that in the case of rent- free accommodation provided by an employer
to an employee at Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras, the perquisite value
will be calculated by adding the excess over 60 per cent of the salary of the
employee. The valuation in regard to other places in India would be with
reference to the excess over 50 per cent. In the case of rent- free furnished
accommodation and addition in respect of the perquisite by way of furniture at
10 per cent per annum of the original cost of such furniture is to be made.
Perquisite value of free furniture, including television sets, radio sets,
refrigerators, other household appliances and air- conditioning plant and
equipment provided to all categories of salaried taxpayers will be taken to be
15 per cent of the original cost of such furniture or where the furniture is
hired, the hire charges payable by the employer. In the case of person,,,
employed by the RBI, statutory corporations, government companies, bodies or
undertakings financed wholly or mainly by the government and officers of
government whose services have been lent to or who are employed after
retirement from Government service with any company in
which not less than 40 per cent of the shares are held by the Government of
RBI or a corporation owned by RBI, the perquisite value of unfurnished rent-
free residential accommodation will be taken to be 10 per cent of the salary
due to the person in respect of the period during which the accommodation was
occupied by him. If residential accommodation is provided by the employer at a
concessional rent the value of the perquisite will be determined as if the
employee had been provided with rent- free residential accommodation and the
amount so computed will be reduced by the rent payable by the employee. 5
Motor car conveyance.- If a motor car is provided by the employer for the use
by the employee partly for his private or personal purpose and partly for use
in the performance of his duties, a proportionate part of the expenditure
incurred by the employer on the running and maintenance of the motor car and
of the amount representing normal wear and tear of the motor car, which is
attributable to the user of the car by the employee for his private or
personal purposes the duties of employment are to be performed or from back to
his residence will be regarded as use motor car for private or personal
purposes will be taken as the value of the perquisite in the hands of the
employee. Where the employee is provided with or allowed the use of motor car
for his private or personal purposes at a concessional rate, the value of the
perquisite will first be computed as if the perquisite had been provided by
the employer free of charge and the amount so computed will be reduced by the
amount payable by the employee to the employer. 6 Payments to servants.- The
amount spent on the salary of a gardener by the employer does not represent a
sum paid by the employer in respect of any obligation which but for such
payment would have been payable by the employee. The payment of salary to a
gardener as such cannot be regarded as a perquisite so as to justify that
amount being taxed in the hands of' the employees. However, the expenses
incurred by way of maintenance of a gardener may be taken into account for the
purposes of estimating the value of rent- free residential accommodation
provided by the employer under rule 3. The taxable perquisite in the hands of
the employee on account of services of servants provided by the employer will
be calculated at 75 per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per month whichever is
less in the case of sweeper and 50 per cent of actual wages or Rs. 60 per
month whichever is less in the case of gardeners and watchman. 7 Sumptuary
allowance.- Sumptuary allowance has to be treated as an entertainment
allowance. Accordingly such allowance received by a person who is in receipt
of salary from Government to the extent that such allowance is required to be
deducted in computing the income chargeable under the head' salaries' may be
regarded as an allowance exempt and may not be included in the term' salary'
for the purposes of rule 3. 8 Children' s education allowance.- Payments
towards children' s education made to the employee or on behalf of the
employee will be liable to income- tax (i) where fixed allowances are given in
cash by the employer to the employee to meet the cost of education of the
latter' s children; (ii) where the education fees are paid by the employer
directly to the school; and (iii) where the employee incurs the expenses in
the first instance and gets reimbursement from the employer. 9 Premium for
annuity.- The premium paid by an ex- employer to purchase an annuity payable
to an ex- employee is taxable only under section 17 (3) (ii). The payment will
not be admissible as revenue expenditure in the hands of the employer.

lie. The trust deeds containing such a provision should therefore not be
refused recognition if the other conditions prescribed under the rules are
satisfied.
(vi) Winding up of superannuation fund.- An approved superannuation fund
cannot be wound up unless necessitated by the winding up or discontinuance of
the employer' s trade or under- taking.
(vii) A superannuation fund where rules provide for pension benefits in the
form of' annuity certain' is not entitled for approval, as the same is not
covered under rule 89 of the Income- tax Rules.
(viii) The limit mentioned in rule 80 is in respect of the salary of each
employee taken separately and also in respect of each year of his service
taken separately.
(ix) Approval of superannuation funds which provide for payment of annuities
to an employee or transfer of equitable interest to another approved
superannuation fund when the employee leaves the services voluntarily before
he attains the specified age of retirement may not be refused merely on the
ground that he left the service voluntarily before he reached the age of
normal retirement.
(x) The words' pay' and' salary' should be interpreted alike for all purposes
of the PF Rules since the word' salary' has been defined in the Act and since
contributions to the fund are also being made by the employee members on this
basis, the word pay occurring in the Rules relating to withdrawals should also
be interpreted to have the same meaning as salary.
(xi) Gratuity funds.- Initial contributions to approved gratuity funds may be
permitted to be made in not more than five annual instalments commencing from
the year in which the employee has been admitted to the benefits of the fund.
An application for approval of Gratuity Fund may be made three years after the
establishment of the gratuity fund. In order that the benefits of approval for
the intervening period may not be denied to bona fide funds Commissioners may
after considering all the relevant facts of the case accord approval with
effect from the date from which it satisfies the conditions laid down in rule
3 of Part C of the Fourth Schedule.
(xii) Bad debts.- The suggestion of Chambers of Commerce and the Indian Banks
Association that in the case of Banks the bad debts claimed should be
automatically allowed in their entirety in the assessments of the banks was
not acceptable. Where accounts are kept on mercantile basis, interest thereon
is taxable irrespective of whether the interest is credited to suspense
account or to interest account. The amount of such interest is therefore
includible in the taxable income.[ Instruction No. 1186, dated 20th June, 1978

granite or other rocks that are cut and exported as raw blocks after being
washed and cleaned. The entry in the Twelfth Schedule is very clear and
unambiguous and uses the term" cut and polished".
2. The amendment with regard to sales over the counters has retrospective effect from 1st April, 1986 and it would normally apply even to completed assessments. However past cases where assessments have already been completed would not be reopened with a view to check up whether counter- sales have been treated as exports for the purposes of the relief under this section. Where, however, the records of the assessee clearly show that such sales over the counter have been given relief under the section the Assessing Officer will have to take necessary action to rectify the mistake.
3. Deduction under this section is to be allowed after the income chargeable to tax under the head' profits and gains from business and profession' has been computed under rule 8.
4. The Finance Act, 1990 made a clarificatory amendment by inserting a definition for the term' total turnover' to exclude cash compensatory support, duty drawback and profit on sale of import entitlements. Since the amendment only clarified the legislative intention as it always existed, the position as regards the past years should be the same as that after coming into force of the amendment.
5. The Finance Act, 1990 has restricted the definition of the term' export turnover' to mean FOB sale proceeds actually received by the assessee in convertible foreign exchange within six months of the end of the previous year or within such further period as the Chief Commissioner Commissioner may allow in this regard. In the case of an assessee who is doing export business exclusively' export turnover' and' total turnover' would be identical if the entire sale proceeds are brought into India in convertible foreign exchange within the prescribed time limit.. In order to arrive at the amount deductible under the section in the case of an assessee doing export business as well as some other domestic business the fraction of' export turnover' to' total turnover' will be applied to his profits computed under the head' profits and gains from business or profession'.
6. An assessee exporting goods or merchandise under Government to Government credits will also be eligible for claiming the deduction irrespective of the fact that the sale proceeds of such exports are realised in their hands in Indian currency.
7. If any export house trading house holding a certificate in this regard for the relevant accounting period passes on to the manufacturer part of the amount of the tax benefit derived on account of the deduction under section 80HHC then the amount of actual payment made to the manufacturer for passing on the tax benefit may, subject to the limit laid down be treated as business expenditure and be allowed as deduction in the computation of the total income of the export trading house. The total amount of the tax benefit on account of the deduction under section 80HHC and the tax benefit on account of the aforesaid deduction shall in no case exceed the maximum amount of tax benefit available under the section to the export trading house.
8. The provisions of the proviso to section 80HHC will not be infringed if dividends are distributed by the assessee out of the reserve contemplated therein.
9. Export of cut and polished diamonds and gem stones will not amount to export of minerals and ores and hence will qualify for relief under section 80HHC.
80HHD. 1 Deduction in respect of earnings in convertible foreign exchange
(1) Where an assessee, being an Indian company or a person (other than a
company) resident in India, is engaged in the business of a hotel or of a tour

may be, a tour operator approved by the prescribed authority on or after the

Individuals who render service outside India in the capacity of independent
contractors or consultants are not eligible for the deduction. Seamen working
as marine engineers, radio officers masters, mates, pursers or captains are to
be regarded as technicians. Helpers to masons who assist in concrete mixing,
RCC work, etc. and other persons similarly placed will be regarded as
technicians. If the service is for a period not exceeding 36 months there is
no bar to the same individual claiming the deduction in respect of any
subsequent employment after he had served the same employer-. Where the
services outside India are performed under different employers the period of
service under these employers cannot be clubbed together so as to deny the
benefit of deduction- as the services under different employers would be under
different agreements. Remuneration received by seamen outside India in foreign
exchange for services rendered outside India would qualify for the deduction.

possible in any case he should enclose a certificate from an accountant
verifying that the payment of tax, etc. and claimed as deduction had been made
by the due date for the filing of the return. As regards sums mentioned at (b)

reports:
(i) all cases other than company and trust cases with returned income loss

245HA. 1 Power of Settlement Commission to send a case back to the 2
Assessing] Officer If the assessee does not co- operate
(1) The Settlement Commission may, if it is of opinion that any person who
made an application for settlement under section 245C has not co- operated
with the Settlement Commission in the proceedings before it, send, the case
back to the 3 Assessing] Officer who shall thereupon dispose of the case in
accordance with the provisions of this Act as if no application under section
245C had been made.
(2) For the purposes of sub- section (1), the 4 Assessing] Officer shall be
entitled to use all the materials and other information produced by the
assessee before the Settlement Commission or the results of the inquiry held
or evidence recorded by the Settlement Commission in the course of the
proceedings before it as if such materials, information, inquiry and evidence
had been produced before the 5 Assessing] Officer or held or recorded by him
in the course of the proceedings before him.
(3) For the purposes of the time limit under sections 149, 153, 154, 155 and
231 and for the purposes of payment of interest under sections 243 and 244, in

case may be. The scope of enquiry, whether by the High Court or before the
Supreme Court, remains the same, viz., to consider whether the order of the
Settlement Commission is contrary to the provisions of the Income- tax Act,
and if so, whether it has prejudiced the petitioner. This is, of course apart
from grounds of bias, fraud and malice which constitute a separate and
independent category. Where, in a case before the Settlement Commission, the
Commission has to interpret a trust deed, even if the interpretation placed by
Commission on the trust deed is not correct, it would not be a ground for
interference by the Supreme Court in an appeal from the order of the
Settlement Commission made under section 245D, since a wrong interpretation of
a deed of trust cannot be said to be a violation of the provisions of the
Income- tax Act. It is equally clear that the interpretation placed upon the
deed by the Commission does not bind the incometax authorities in proceedings
relating to other assessment years not covered by the order. Jyotendrasinghji

penalty for default in making payment of such sum may be imposed and recovered
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter XVII, by the 1 Assessing] Officer
having, jurisdiction over the person who made the application for settlement

(i) an order of settlement passed under sub- section (4) of section 245D
provides for the imposition of a penalty on the person who made the
application under section 245C for settlement, on the ground of concealment of
particulars of his income; or
(ii) after the passing of an order of settlement under the said subsection (4)
in relation to a case, such person is convicted of any offence under Chapter
XXII in relation to that case; 2 or]
(iii) 3 the case of such person is sent back to the 4 Assessing] Officer by
the Settlement Commission under section 245HA,] then, he shall not be entitled
to apply for settlement under section 245C in relation to any other matter.
245L. Proceedings before Settlement Commission to be judicial proceedings Any
proceeding under this Chapter before the Settlement Commission shall be deemed
to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228, and
