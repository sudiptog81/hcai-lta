T.B. Kadam [(1976) 3 SCC 71], U.P.SRTC v. Basudeo Chaudhary [(1997) 11 SCC
370], Janatha Bazar (south kanara Central Coop. Wholesale Stores Ltd.) v.

Hullikatti [(2001) 2 SCC 574] and Rajasthan SRTC v. Ghanshyam Sharma [(2002)
10 SCC 330].
23\. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh [(2006) 6 SCC 187] and U.P. SRTC v. Vinod Kumar
[(2008) 1 SCC 115] this Court held that the punishment should always be
proportionate to the gravity of the misconduct. However, in a case of
corruption/ misappropriation, the only punishment is dismissal.
24\. This, in view of the above, the contention raised on behalf of the
employee that punishment of dismissal from service was disproportionate to the
proved delinquency of the employee, is not worth acceptance."
33.Hence in the light of the discussions made above both on facts and law,
this Court does not find any ground to interfere with the order of dismissal
passed by the first respondent. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is dismissed.
No costs.

    O R D E R
The Writ Petition has been filed by the petitioner, challenging the dismissal
of the I.D.No.165 of 1992 on the file of the first respondent confirming the
order of dismissal passed by the second respondent.
Facts in brief:
> 2.The petitioner herein was working as a Conductor with the second
> respondent. He had been working in the said capacity from 1975 onwards. An
> order of suspension was passed against the petitioner by the second
> respondent on 12.03.1992. Thereafter, a charge memo was issued to the
> petitioner by the second respondent on 30.03.1992 on the ground that, the
> petitioner had misappropriated the money due to the second respondent by
> stealing ticket books and invoices belonging to the other buses and used
> them in the bus in which he was plying. The said charges are pertaining to
> the period between November 1991 to February 1992. It is also stated in the
> charge memo that, during the enquiry it came to the knowledge that excess
> diesel has been used in a particular bus and while examining the driver, he
> informed that due to heavy passengers intake and higher income, the said
> expenses had occurred.
> 3.Thereafter, the income particulars of the route bus was checked, by which
> it was found that the collection was lesser than the other buses which were
> plying in the very same route. When this was pointed out to the driver, he
> was surprised and informed the authorities that he was given excess batta of
> Rs.28/-, since the income had been very high. In view of the said statement,
> the petitioner was asked to report before the Branch Manager. However, he
> reported only on the next date and during enquiry it was found that, the
> collection made by him on that date was lesser than that of the other buses
> plying in the same route. During further enquiry it was found that, the
> collection was lesser for a quite some time in the bus in which the
> petitioner was working as a Conductor.
> 4.When an explanation was asked from the petitioner, he has stated that, the
> driver was driving the vehicle very slowly and as a result the passengers
> were not willing to board the bus as more time is taken to reach the
> destination. Further enquiry was made based upon the records, in which it
> was found out that there were discrepancies in the number of passengers
> boarded. Thereafter, the petitioner was enquired in his house on 11.03.1992
> during which enquiry he accepted and admitted that, he has stolen the ticket
> books and invoices of the buses which were not running,and used it in the
> bus in which he was working. A statement was also given by him to that
> extent. He was further asked to demonstrate his action and accordingly, he
> along with other officials went to the Office and produced the stolen ticket
> books and invoices covered in a cloth from the rack. He again gave another
> statement regarding the recovery made from him in the presence of the
> witnesses. Therefore, under those circumstances, the charge memo was given
> towards the theft of the invoices and bus tickets and for committing loss to
> the Corporation by the sale of such tickets. The said charge memo was issued
> without prejudice to the filing of an additional charge memo for the period
> in which the investigation was yet to be done.
> 5.An explanation was given by the petitioner on 06.04.1992 under Ex.M-12. In
> the said explanation, he has stated that the statements have been obtained
> by force and coercion at his residence. He has further stated that it is
> impossible to steal the ticket books and invoices of the other buses without
> the knowledge of the concerned authorities. Not satisfying with the
> statement given by the petitioner, an enquiry was ordered and conducted by
> appointing an Enquiry Officer.
> 6.Before the Enquiry Officer, three witnesses have been examined on the side
> of the second respondent. The petitioner has examined himself on his side.
> The Enquiry Officer has also considered the documents produced by the
> Management. After the conclusion of the enquiry, a report was filed by the
> Enquiry Officer under Ex.M.14 dated 22.06.1992 holding that, all the charges
> levelled against the petitioner were proved. In pursuant to the Enquiry
> Officer's report, the petitioner was given a show cause notice dated
> 13.07.1992 under Ex.M.16. After considering the reply of the petitioner, an
> order of dismissal was passed under Ex.M-19 dated 18.08.1992. A complaint
> was also given against the petitioner before the jurisdictional Police
> Station but the said complaint was closed as the materials were found
> insufficient.
> 7.In the meanwhile, the petitioner filed a Writ Petition in W.P.No.12095 of
> 1992 on the ground that, in view of the pendency of the criminal case, the
> departmental proceedings shall not be allowed to proceed with. The Writ
> Petition as well as the Writ Appeal filed were dismissed against the
> petitioner. The petitioner filed another Writ Petition in W.P.No.15949 of
> 1994, challenging the order dated 19.07.1994, by which the Industrial
> Tribunal has given approval for the order of dismissal under 33(2)(b) of the
> Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. In the said Writ Petition, it was submitted
> by the petitioner that, the criminal case filed against the petitioner was
> closed, the past records of the petitioner were not perused by the
> disciplinary authority and the penalty of dismissal imposed on the
> petitioner was grossly disproportionate to the charges alleged against him.
> In the meanwhile, proceedings have been initiated against the petitioner for
> some other period based upon the very same allegation. However, in view of
> the collection of the enquiry which resulted in the punishment, the
> subsequent proceedings have been dropped as unnecessary.
> 8.The learned single Judge of this Court was pleased to hold that Ex.M-2 has
> been signed by the petitioner which is a statement given by him accepting
> his guilt. It was further observed that the contention of the petitioner
> that the signature was obtained by force is not borne out by records and no
> complaint has been made against it. Another finding was given that the
> ticket books and invoices were recovered from the locker of the second
> respondent. A reference was also made to Ex.M-3 being the invoices of the
> buses. The learned single Judge was pleased to hold that, it cannot be said
> that the signature of the petitioner was obtained on a blank paper and the
> domestic enquiry was conducted properly. The learned single Judge was
> pleased to dismiss the Writ Petition by further observing that the
> petitioner has not challenged the order of dismissal by raising a dispute.
> 9.After the dismissal of the Writ Petition in W.P.No.15949 of 1994, the
> petitioner raised a dispute in I.D.No.165 of 1997 before the first
> respondent. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner made
> submissions before the Tribunal primarily on the ground that, there was a
> violation of the standing order in Section 17(4)(a), inasmuch as the reasons
> for the suspension has not been granted within a period of one week, as the
> same was given only on 30.03.1992 by way of a charge memo. A further
> submission was made on the ground that the charges levelled are vague and it
> has not been specifically stated in the charge memo about the date in which
> the amount has been misappropriated. The Labour Court on a appreciation of
> the evidence available on record, both oral and documentary was pleased to
> dismiss the dispute mainly basing reliance upon Exs.M-1 and M-2 apart from
> the oral evidence.
> 10.The Labour Court further held that, the enquiry has been conducted in a
> free and fair manner as found by this Court and considering the charges
> levelled against the petitioner, the order of dismissal cannot be interfered
> with. On the question of vagueness of charges, the Labour Court found that
> it cannot be said that the petitioner has not understood the charges and the
> mere delay of few days in issuing the charge memo would not vitiate the
> proceedings. Challenging the said order passed by the Labour Court, the
> petitioner has come forward to file the present Writ Petition.
Submissions of the petitioner:
11.Shri.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted
that, the findings of the Labour Court are perverse and not supported by
materials. The Ticket Checking Inspectors who checked the tickets on the
relevant dates have not been examined. Exs.M-1 and M-2 have been obtained by
force and coercion. P.Ws.1 to 3 have not seen the statement given by the
petitioner. No enquiry has been initiated against the concerned officials from
whose custody the tickets and invoices were said to be stolen by the
petitioner. The criminal case filed against the petitioner has been closed in
his favour. Exs.M-3 and M-6 to 8 have not been considered properly. The
Enquiry Officer has put the entire onus on the petitioner wrongly. The Labour
Court has not considered the evidence of the petitioner properly. The reliance
made upon by the judgment of this Court by the Labour Court is bad in law.
12.The learned counsel further submitted that when the departmental enquiry is
conducted in a manner contrary to law, an order of dismissal passed as a
consequent thereon will have to be set aside. When there is an allegation of
fraud and misappropriation, then it has been proved by acceptable evidence.
When a finding arrived at in a departmental proceedings is totally against
fair play and the basic principle of law, then this Court will have to
exercise the power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The order
of punishment has been imposed even before the conclusion of the enquiry. In
support of his submissions, the learned counsel has made reliance upon the
following judgments:
1.AMULYA RATAN MUKHERJEE vs. DEPUTY CHIEF MECHANICAL ENGINEER, EASTERN RLY.AND
OTHERS [AIR 1961 CALCUTTA 40]
2.SAWAI SINGH vs. STATE OF RAJASTHAN [AIR 1986 SC 995]
3.G.CHANDRA KANTH vs. GUNTUR DT.MILK PRODUCERS UNION LTD. & ORS. [1995 HIGH
COURT, ANDHRA PRADESH]
4.CAPT.M.PAUL ANTHONY vs. BHARAT GOLD MINES LTD. AND ANOTHER [(1999) 3 SCC
679]
5.VINCENT, D. vs. THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT EXAMINATIONS [1987 WRIT L.R.69]
6.P.B.ROCHO vs. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS [1984 KLT 590]
7.T.JAYABALAN vs. INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE (LAW AND ORDER), DEPUTY
INSPECTOR GENERAL FO POLICE AND SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE [W.P.NO.34189 OF 2006
DATED 12.01.2010] Submissions of the second respondent:
13.M/s.Kala Ramesh, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent
submitted that, decisions have been made by the respondents based upon the
materials available on record. Such a decision based upon factual findings
shall not be interfered with by this Court by acting as an appellate
authority. The petitioner having given voluntary statements under Exs.M-1 and
2 cannot contend that the charges levelled against him are not proved. The
petitioner has signed Exs.M-1 and 2. The charges levelled against the
petitioner are very serious. Ex.M-3 clearly proves the nature of offences
committed by the petitioner. The report of the Enquiry Officer itself makes it
clear that,there is negligence on the part of the other officials. Action has
been taken by the other officials also. In view of the punishment awarded in
the first enquiry, the subsequent enquiry have not been proceeded with. The
petitioner has wrongly submitted that even before the enquiry the proceedings
have been concluded.
14.The learned counsel further submitted that, the petitioner has given
contrary statement regarding the execution of Exs.M-1 and 2 which are the
statements given by him. The petitioner has not spelt out the reasons for
obtaining the statements by force. No complaints have been made against the
said officers to higher authorities. The learned counsel has made reliance
upon the judgments of the Honourable Apex Court in GOVT. OF A.P. AND OTHERS
vs. MOHD.NASRULLAH KHAN [(2006) 2 SCC 373], A.P.SRTC vs. RAGHUDA SIVA SANKAR
PRASAD [(2007) 1 SCC 222], U.P.STATE ROAD TRANSPORT CORPORATION vs. SURESH
CHAND SHARMA [(2010) 6 SCC 555] and submitted that, in a case where the
domestic enquiry has been conducted in a free and fair manner, the Labour
Court has analysed the facts the High Court shall not exercise its
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the
learned counsel submitted that the Writ Petition will have to be dismissed.
Findings:-
> 15.This Court is quite aware of the jurisdiction over disciplinary
> proceedings conducted by a competent authority which has been appreciated by
> the Labour Court. However, in view of the elaborate submissions made on
> facts by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, this Court is
> constrained to go into the same.
> 16.Allegation against the petitioner is that he has stolen the ticket books
> and invoices of the buses which were not running and sold the same to the
> passengers of the bus in which he was working as a Conductor and committed
> the misconduct. The charge memo has been filed based upon the investigation
> done by the authorities. During the enquiry made with the driver it was
> found that, he was having excess amount as batta and the collection showed
> lesser amount. It also revealed that the collection in the bus in which the
> petitioner was working, had been low for quite some time as against the
> other buses plying in the very same route.
> 17.The petitioner was working as a Conductor on 19.09.1991 in the route
> between Papanasam to Thiruchendur. Checking was made by two Inspectors at
> Seranmadevi Bus stop. The petitioner has signed the checking report and
> invoices. The details of the checking was also noted in the invoices in
> E.No.20145. The petitioner was returning from Thiruchendur to Papanasam, the
> vehicle was checked at Srivaikuntam. However, the number of passengers who
> travelled between Thiruchendur to Papanasam was about 33 + 2 has not been
> shown in the same invoice (E.No.20145). Therefore, a finding has been given
> on the ground that the petitioner has used the correct ticket and invoice
> while travelling from Papanasam to Thiruchendur and after the checkup at
> Sermadevi, he has suppressed the above said invoice and ticket book and used
> the stolen ones for the return from Thiruchendur to Papanasam. Thereafter at
> the time of handing over the remaining tickets and invoices, he took up the
> actual invoices and filled it up with the return passengers by deflating the
> income and reducing the number of passengers who travelled from Thiruchendur
> to Papanasam. The said finding was given based upon the records available
> with the Checking Inspectors in which the petitioner has signed. A similar
> incidence was also found on 30.05.1991.
> 18.The Enquiry Officer found that there is no explanation from the
> petitioner for not getting the signature of the Checking Inspector while
> travelling from one place to another and also returning from the other place
> to the starting place. The Enquiry Officer also found that there are
> discrepancies in the records of the Checking Inspectors and the one produced
> by the petitioner in which the signature of all the Checking Inspectors were
> not found. The discrepancies are pertaining to the number of passengers as
> the invoices produced by the petitioner showed lesser number of passengers.
> It was also pointed out to the petitioner during enquiry.
> 19.Therefore from the available records, the Enquiry Officer found that the
> petitioner has committed the misconduct. The petitioner in his explanation
> has not stated anything about Ex.B-3. The learned counsel for the petitioner
> Shri.V.Raghavachari submitted that Ex.B-3 only supports the case of the
> petitioner. This Court is afraid that such a contention has never been
> raised in the Labour Court and also before the departmental proceedings.
> Further as seen from Ex.B-3 the very case of the second respondent is that
> the petitioner has misused the records and made additions as the invoice did
> not contain the signatures of all the Checking Inspectors. The further
> finding is that it is the petitioner who has filled it up to suit his
> convenience by suppressing the tickets and invoices and replaced them with
> others and thereafter made wrong entries. Hence, such findings which are
> borne out by records and supported by evidence available on record, do not
> warrant any interference.
> 20.In so far as Exs.M-1 and 2 are concerned, it is seen that the petitioner
> himself has made contrary statement. In his explanation given on 06.04.1992
> under Ex.M-12 he has stated that the authorities came to his house and by
> force and coercion they obtained a signature and asked him to write what
> they wanted, in two white papers. In the subsequent representation dated
> 22.06.1992 under Ex.M-14, the petitioner has stated that they obtained
> another statement in the Office. Therefore, from the above said submissions,
> it is very clear that the petitioner has not explained his conduct in
> writing under Exs.M-1 and 2 properly. The contention of the learned counsel
> for the petitioner that the eye-witness who has signed the above said
> documents being not seen actually also cannot be countenanced. Those
> witnesses have been present when the petitioner has signed Ex.M-1 and M-2.
> They have signed the same in the presence of the petitioner. It is settled
> position of law that strict rules of evidence are not required in a
> departmental proceedings. The petitioner has not made any allegations either
> before the departmental proceedings or thereafter, that the Officers of the
> second respondent are inimically disposed of against him. He has not
> explained the reason why the officers have forced him to give the
> statements. Further no complaints have been made against the petitioner to
> the higher authorities about the same. On the contrary, the evidence of
> record would show that the petitioner during the investigation in his
> residence has admitted his guilt and demonstrated the same by going over to
> the Office and handing over the remaining unsold tickets and invoices which
> were meant for misused.
> 21.The petitioner has filed two Writ Petitions on the earlier occasions. In
> the Writ Petition filed in W.P.No.15949 of 1994, a finding was given by the
> learned single Judge that the contention of the petitioner regarding the
> statements having been obtained by force cannot be accepted. The learned
> single Judge has also observed that the petitioner has not approached the
> Labour Court challenging the order of dismissal. It is only thereafter the
> petitioner has approached the Labour Court. Therefore, the said findings
> have been given by the learned single Judge as the petitioner himself has
> warranted the same by filing the earlier Writ Petition. That is a reason why
> the Labour Court has also made reliance upon the same. It is further to the
> seen that a contention was specifically raised in the earlier Writ Petition
> by the petitioner stating that punishment imposed is disproportionate to the
> charges which were also rejected by the learned single Judge.
> 22.It is seen that primarily only three submissions were made by the learned
> counsel for the petitioner before the Labour Court. The said submissions are
> pertaining to the vagueness in the charges, delay in issuing the charge memo
> and non monitoring of the date for the theft committed by the petitioner.
> The Labour Court has considered the above said submissions and found that
> there is nothing wrong in the order of dismissal passed by the second
> respondent in the delay of issuing the charge memo. The Labour Court also
> found that the charges are not vague and the petitioner was in a position to
> putforth his case as he understood the charges properly. A further finding
> was given that there is no necessity to give any specific date of alleged
> misconduct and in any case the same would not vitiate the proceedings. Apart
> from that the Labour Court has gone into the merits of the case and
> appreciated the oral and documentary evidence available on record for coming
> to the conclusion. Hence, this Court does not find the order of the Labour
> Court needs any interference.
> 23.It is seen from the records that two proceedings have been initiated
> against the petitioner. Even a perusal of the charge memo would indicate
> that an additional charge memo would be given in view of the on going
> investigation. However, the second proceeding was not continued, since an
> order of dismissal was passed already. The petitioner has mixed both the
> enquiries pertaining to the two charge memos into one. In so far as the
> charge memo which is the subject matter of the Writ Petition is concerned,
> the charges have been framed, enquiry conducted, a copy of the same was
> given to the petitioner, a show cause notice was issued on the charges
> framed and thereafter final orders have been passed. Therefore, this Court
> does not find any merit in the submissions of the learned counsel appearing
> for the petitioner that even before the enquiry is completed a final order
> is passed.
Violation of Principles of Natural Justice:
24.In the present case on hand, there is no violation of principles of natural
justice and no prejudice is shown even if there is a violation. In this
connection it is useful to refer the pronouncement of the Honourable Apex
Court in STATE BANK OF PATIALA vs. S.K.SHARMA [(1996) 3 SCC 364], wherein it
is held thus:
"33.(3)... Violation of any and every procedural provision cannot be said to
automatically vitiate the enquiry held or order passed. Except in cases
falling under-'no notice', 'no opportunity' and 'no hearing' categories, the
complaint of violation of procedural provision should be examined from the
point of view of prejudice viz. whether such violation has prejudiced the
delinquent officer/employee in defending himself properly and effectively."
Scope of Judicial Review:
25.It is trite law that a judicial review of this Court over a decision
rendered by the Industrial Tribunal which was asked to adjudicate upon the
validity of the departmental proceedings is very limited. Until and unless the
Labour Court committed a gross error which is manifest and apparent, this
Court cannot act as an appellate authority and re-appreciate the evidence. In
this case, not only the Labour Court but also the second respondent in the
departmental enquiry have given factual findings based upon the materials
available on record. There is nothing to demonstrate that the findings
rendered by the respondents are perverse or based upon no evidence.
26.The Honourable Apex Court in GOVT. OF A.P. AND OTHERS vs. MOHD.NASRULLAH
KHAN [(2006) 2 SCC 373] considering the scope of judicial review under Article
226 of the constitution of India has held as follows:
"11. By now it is a well-established principle of law that the High Court
exercising power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution does
not act as an appellate authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and
confined to correct errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in
manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of natural justice.
Judicial review is not akin to adjudication on merit by reappreciating the
evidence as an appellate authority.
12\. We may now notice a few decisions of this Court on this aspect avoiding
multiplicity. In Union of India V. Parama Nanda [(1989) 2 SCC 177], K.
Jagannatha Shetty, J., speaking for the bench, observed at SCC p.189, para 27
as under:
"27. We must unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to
interfere with the disciplinary matters or punishment cannot be equated with
an appellate jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot interfere with the findings of
the inquiry officer or competent authority where they are not arbitray or
utterly perverse. It is appropriate to remember that the power to impose
penalty on a delinquent officer is conferred on the competent authority either
by an Act of legislature or rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution. If there has been an enquiry consistent with the rules and in
accordance with principles of natural justice what punishment would meet the
ends of justice is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the
competent authority. If the penalty can lawfully be imposed and is imposed on
the proved misconduct, the Tribunal has no power to substitute its own
discretion for that of the authority. The adequacy of penalty unless it is
mala fide is certainly not a matter for the Tribunal to concern itself with.
The Tribunal also cannot interfere with the penalty if the conclusion of the
inquiry officer or the competent authority is based on evidence even if some
if it is found to be irrelevant or extraneous to the matter."
13\. Again, the same principle has been reiterated by this Court in B.C.
Chaturvedi v. Union of India [(1995) 6 SCC 749]. K. Ramaswamy, J., speaking
for the Court, observed at SCC p.759, para 12 as under:
"12. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the
manner in which the decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant to
ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the
conclusion which the authority reaches is necessarily correct in the eye of
the Court. When an inquiry is conducted on charges or misconduct by a public
servant, the Court/Tribunal is concerned to determine whether the inquiry was
held by a competent officer or whether rules of natural justice are complied
with. Whether the findings or conculsions are based on some evidence, the
authority entrusted with the power to hold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and
authority to reach a finding of fact or conclusion. But that finding must be
based on some evidence. Neither the technical rules of Evidence Act nor of
proof of fact or evidence as defined therein, apply to disciplinary
proceeding. When the authority accepts that evidence and conclusion receives
support therefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that the
delinquent officer is guilty of the charge. The Court / Tribunal in its power
of judicial review does not act as Appellate Authority to reappreciate the
evidence and to arrive at its own independent findings on the evidence. The
court / Tribunal may interfere where the authority held the proceedings
against the delinquent officer in a manner inconsistent with the rules of
natural justice or in violation of statutory rules prescribing the mode of
inquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by the disciplinary
authority is based on no evidence. If the conclusion or finding be such as no
reasonable person would have ever reached, the Court / Tribunal may interfere
with the conclusion or the finding, and mould the relief so as to make it
appropriate to the facts of the case."
14\. As already said, in the present case there is no allegation of violation
of principles of natural justice or the inquiry being held inconsistent with
the mode of procedure prescribed by the rules or regulations."
27.Similarly in A.P.SRTC vs. RAGHUDA SIVA SANKAR PRASAD [(2007) 1 SCC 222] has
held as follows:
"22.It is also not open to the tribunal and courts to substitute their
subjective opinion in place of the one arrived at the domestic tribunal. In
the instant case, the opinion arrived at by the Corporation was rightly
accepted by the Tribunal but not by the Court. We, therefore, hold that the
order of reinstatement passed by the Single Judge and the Division bench of
the High Court is contrary to the law on the basis of a catena of decisions of
this Court. In such cases, there is no place for generosity or sympathy on the
part of the judicial forums for interfering with the quantum of punishment of
removal which cannot be justified. Similarly, the High Court can modify the
punishment in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution only when its finds that the punishment imposed is shockingly
disproportionate to the charges proved."
28.In a recent pronouncement rendered in U.P.STATE ROAD TRANSPORT CORPORATION
vs. SURESH CHAND SHARMA [(2010) 6 SCC 555] it has been held hereunder:
"16. In State of Haryana V. Rattan Singh [(1977) 2 SCC 491] this Court has
categorically held that in a domestic enquiry, complicated principles and
procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Evidence Act,
1872 do not apply. The only right of a delinquent employee is that he must be
informed as to what are the charges against him and he must be given full
opportunity to defend himself on the said charges. However, the Court rejected
the contention that the enquiry report stood vitiated for not recording the
statements of the passengers who were found traveling without ticket. The
Court held as under: (SCC pp.493-94, para 5) "5.... We cannot hold that merely
because statements of passengers were not recorded the order that followed was
invalid. Likewise, the re-evaluation of the evidence on the strength of co-
conductor's testimony is a matter not for the court but for the Administrative
Tribunal. In conclusion, we do not think the courts below were right in
overturning the finding of the domestic tribunal."
17\. In view of the above, the reasoning so given by the High Court cannot be
sustained in the eye of the law.
29.Recently a Division Bench of this Court in DR.R.PADMAVATHY vs. THE
SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, STATE OF TAMIL NADU [2011 (2) CTC 129] considering
the scope of judicial review has held in the following manner:
"6.The scope of judicial review of the administrative decision particularly
the disciplinary inquiry and the order imposing punishment by the authority
has been discussed by the Supreme Court in catena of decisions. Normally
Courts should not interfere with the administrative decision unless it was
illogical and suffers from procedural impropriety or is shocking to the
conscious of the Courts. When the administrative action is challenged as
arbitrary, the question will be whether the administrative order is rationale
or reasonable and the test would be Wednesbury's Test. In the case of Chairman
and Managing Director, United Commercial Bank and others v. P.C.Kakkar, 2003
AIR SCW 944, the Supreme Court observed:
"11.The common thread running through in all these decisions is that the Court
should not interfere with the administrator's decision unless it was illogical
or suffers from procedural impropriety or was shocking to the conscience of
the Court, in the sense that it was in defiance of logic or moral standards.
In view of what has been stated in Wednesbury case, the Court would not go
into the correctness of the choice made by the administrator open to him and
the Court should not substitute is decision to that of the administrator. The
scope of judicial review is limited to the deficiency in decision-making
process and not the decision.
12.To put it differently, unless the punishment imposed by the Disciplinary
Authority or the Appellate Authority shocks the conscience of the
Court/Tribunal, there is no scope for interference. Further, to shorten
litigation it may, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate
punishment by recording cogent reasons in support thereof. In the normal
course if the punishment imposed is shockingly disproportionate it would be
appropriate to direct the Disciplinary Authority or the Appellate Authority to
reconsider the penalty imposed."
7.In the case of Tilak Chand Magatram Obhan v. Kamala Prasad Shukla and
others, 1995 Supp (1) SCC 21, strong and hostile bias was alleged and the
Supreme Court while dealing with the question of bias observed as under:
"There is, however, a distinction between a defect in the enquiry and a lapse
which almost destroys the enquiry. Where the lapse is of the enquiry being
conducted by an officer deeply biased against the delinquent or one of them
being so biased that the entire Enquiry proceedings are rendered void, the
Appellate Authority cannot repair the damage done to the enquiry. Where one of
the members of the Enquiry Committee has a strong hatred or bias against the
delinquent of which the other members know not or the said member is in a
position to influence the decision-making, the entire record of the enquiry
will be slanted and any independent decision taken by the Appellate Authority
on such tainted record cannot undo the damage done. Besides where a delinquent
is asked to appear before a Committee of which one member is deeply hostile
towards him, the delinquent would be greatly handicapped in conducting his
defence as he would be inhibited by the atmosphere prevailing in the enquiry
room. Justice must not only be done but must also appear to be done. Would it
so appear to the delinquent if one of the members of the Enquiry Committee has
a strong bias against him? And we repeat the bias must be strong and hostile
and not a mere allegation of bias of a superior having rebuked him in the past
or the like."
8.In the case of Union of Inida v. Sardar Bahadur, 1972 (4) SCC 618, the
Supreme Court observed: (SCC page 623, para. 15) "A Disciplinary proceeding is
not a Criminal trial. The standard proof required is that of preponderance of
probability and not proof beyond reasonable doubt. If the inference that
lender was a person likely to have official dealings with the Respondent was
one which a reasonable person would draw from the proved facts of the case,
the High Court cannot sit as a Court of Appeal over a decision based on it.
The Letters Patent Bench had the same power of dealing with all questions,
either of fact or of law arising in the Appeal, as the Single Judge of the
High Court. If the enquiry has been properly held the question of adequacy or
reliability of the evidence cannot be canvassed before the High Court. A
finding cannot be characterised as perverse or unsupported by any relevant
materials, if it was a reasonable inference from proved facts."
9.The Supreme Court reiterated its earlier view in the case of Union of India
v. Parma Nanda 1989 (2) SCC 177 and observed: (SCC page 189, para 27) "We must
unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to interfere with
the Disciplinary matters or punishment cannot be equated with an Appellate
jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot interfere with the findings of the Inquiry
Officer or Competent Authority where they are not arbitrary or utterly
perverse. It is appropriate to remember that the power to impose penalty on a
delinquent officer is conferred on the Competent Authority either by an Act of
legislature or rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution. If there has been an enquiry consistent with the rules and in
accordance with Principles of Natural Justice what punishment would meet the
ends of justice is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the
Competent Authority. If the penalty can lawfully be imposed and is imposed on
the proved misconduct, the Tribunal has no power to substitute its own
discretion for that of the authority. The adequacy of penalty unless it is
mala fide is certainly not a matter for the Tribunal to concern itself with.
The Tribunal also cannot interfere with the penalty if the conclusion of the
Inquiry Officer or the Competent Authority is based on evidence even if some
of it is found to be irrelevant or extraneous to the matter."
30.Therefore, on a consideration of the ratio laid down by the judgments
referred supra, coupled with the fact that the enquiry having been conducted
in a free and fair manner and the respondents 1 and 2 having taken into
consideration of the material facts available on record, this Court does not
find any reason to exercise the power of judicial review in the present case
on hand.
31.The petitioner was working as a Conductor. His duty is to collect the money
and hand over the same to the second respondent. He holds the money in trust
of the respondents. In such an event, this Court cannot show any leniency when
the charges of misconduct towards the misappropriation of money are proved. In
this connection, it is useful to refer the judgment of the Honourable Apex
Court in REGIONAL MANAGER, U.P.SRTC vs. HOTI LAL [2003 (3) SCC 605] wherein it
has been held as follows:
"12.In Regional Manager, U.P. SRTC v. Hoti Lal, 2003 (3) SCC 605, the Supreme
Court observed: (SCC page 614, para 10) "If the charged employee holds a
position of trust where honesty and integrity are inbuilt requirements of
functioning, it would not be proper to deal with the matter leniently.
Misconduct in such cases has to be dealt with iron hands. Where the person
deals with public money or is engaged in financial transactions or acts in a
fiduciary capacity, the highest degree of integrity and trustworthiness is a
must and unexceptionable."
32.A similar view was also expressed by the Honourable Apex Court in U.P.STATE
ROAD TRANSPORT CORPORATION vs. SURESH CHAND SHARMA [(2010) 6 SCC 555] it has
been held hereunder:
"21. We do not find any force in the submissions made by Dr.J.N.Dubey, learned
senior Counsel for the employee that for embezzlement of such a petty amount,
punishment of dismissal could not be justified for the reason that it is not
the amount embezzled by a delinquent employee but the mens rea to
misappropriate the public money.
22\. In Municipal Committee, Bahadurgarh v. Krishnan Behari [(1996) 2 SCC 714]
this Court held as under: (SCC p.715, para 4) "4. ... In a case of such
nature-indeed, in cases involving corruption  there cannot be any other
punishment than dismisssal. Any sympathy shown in such cases is totally
uncalled for and opposed to public interest. The amount misappropriated may be
small or large; it is the act of misappropriation that is relevant.."
Similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Ruston & Hornsby (I) Ltd. v.
T.B. Kadam [(1976) 3 SCC 71], U.P.SRTC v. Basudeo Chaudhary [(1997) 11 SCC
370], Janatha Bazar (south kanara Central Coop. Wholesale Stores Ltd.) v.
Sahakari Noukarara Sangha [(2000) 7 SCC 517], Karnataka SRTC v. B.S.
Hullikatti [(2001) 2 SCC 574] and Rajasthan SRTC v. Ghanshyam Sharma [(2002)
10 SCC 330].
23\. In NEKRTC v. H. Amaresh [(2006) 6 SCC 187] and U.P. SRTC v. Vinod Kumar
[(2008) 1 SCC 115] this Court held that the punishment should always be
proportionate to the gravity of the misconduct. However, in a case of
corruption/ misappropriation, the only punishment is dismissal.
24\. This, in view of the above, the contention raised on behalf of the
employee that punishment of dismissal from service was disproportionate to the
proved delinquency of the employee, is not worth acceptance."
33.Hence in the light of the discussions made above both on facts and law,
this Court does not find any ground to interfere with the order of dismissal
passed by the first respondent. Accordingly, the Writ Petition is dismissed.
No costs.
