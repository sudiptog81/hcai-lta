    Per Dr. A. L. Saini:
            The captioned appeals filed by the Revenue and Assessee, pertaining to
    assessment years2008-09, 2009-10 & 2010-11 respectively, are directed against
    the separate orders passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals),
    Kolkata, which in turn arise out of fair assessment orders passed by the Assessing
    Officer u/s 143(3)/144C(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short the 'Act')
    which incorporate the findings of the Transfer Pricing Officer u/s 92CA (3) of the
    Income Tax Act, 1961.
    2. Ground relating to Transfer Pricing
    Ground No. 4 raised by the Revenue in ITA No. 1333/Kol/2017 for A.Y. 2008-09
    relates to Transfer Pricing in respect of determination of arm's length price of
    royalty paid by the assessee. The grounds of appeal raised by the Revenue reads as
    follows:
          4.Whether the ld. CIT(A) was correct in deleting the addition of Rs.
          1,18,83,649/- on the ground that the rate of Royalty paid by the assessee
          company is at Arm's Length?
    3. Brief facts qua the issue are that the assessee is engaged in the business of
    manufacturing and trailing of Refractories. During the relevant F.Y.2007-08, it
    was noticedby the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) that the assessee has entered
    into international transaction with it its Associated Enterprises [AEs] namely,
    Vesuvius Crucible Company and Vesuvius Group SA, Belgium on account of
    royalty payment. From the transfer pricing report submitted, it noticedby TPO that
    assessee paid royalty to Vesuvius Crucible Company ("Refractory licensor") and
    Vesuvius Group SA, Belgium ("Systems Licensor"). According to the terms of the
                                                                                                 Pa g e | 2
                                                                                    M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                  I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                    I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8
                                          A s se s smen t Yea r s: 2 0 0 8 - 0 9 , 2 0 0 9 - 1 0 & 2 0 1 0 - 1 1
    royalty agreement between the assessee and its Associated Enterprises (AEs), the
    assessee is required to pay royalty to Refractory Licenser a royalty rate of 3% on
    the domestic sales and 5% on export sales and to the Systems Licensor, a royalty
    of 2% on the domestic sales and 3% on export sales. In order to justify the arm's
    length nature of its transaction, the assessee has applied the CUP method where it
    has stated that the assessee has compared the royalty rates for other Indian
    companies and it is observed that the same is at par with the rates at which royalty
    is paid by VIL. [Page - 11 of the Transfer Pricing Report).
    However,the TPO noticed that in order to verify the assessee's claim, the assessee
    has not brought on record the details of such Indian companies to which the
    assessee's claims its case to be comparable. The characteristics of comparables are
    considered important for comparison in the CUP method. In the case of Intangible
    property, it would comprise the form of transaction (e.g. licensing or sale), the
    type of property (e.g. patent, trademark, or know-how), the duration and degree of
    protection, and the anticipated benefits from the use of the property. The question
    thus, came before the TPO that which is the most appropriate method - CUP or
    TNMM for determining ALP? Traditional transaction methods, such as CUP, are
    normally the most direct method for determining ALP. The transactional profit
    split method, on the other hand, is based on an approximation of the division of
    profits that independent enterprises would have expected to realize from engaging
    in the transaction(s). The TPO noted that the greatest weakness is that the net
    margin of a taxpayer can be influenced by some factors that either do not have an
    effect, or have a less substantial or direct effect, on price or gross margins. These
    aspects make accurate and reliable determinations of arm's length net margins
    difficult. Thus, so far as the appropriateness of the method is concerned, CUP is
    the most appropriate method for determining the transactions here, namely,
    royalty. Then TPO cited the judgment of coordinate bench of ITATMumbai in the
    case of Gharda Chemicals vs DCIT (ITA No. 2242/Mum/06, AY 2002-03)
    wherein it was held that CUP method is preferred over other method.As the
    assessee has not conducted any search to benchmark its royalty payment, an
    independent search analysis was conducted by TPO using the Royaltystatdatabase,
                                                                                                   Pa g e | 3
                                                                                      M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                    I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                      I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8

    which yielded four comparable companies. A show cause letter dt.27.10.2011 was
    issued to the assessee which is reproduced below (to the extent applicable for our
    discussion):
    "From the Transfer Pricing document submitted to this office, it is noted that the assessee
    is making royalty payment to its Associated Enterprises [AEs] at the rate of 3% on the
    net domestic sales and 5% on the net export sales as well as 2% on the net domestic sales
    and 3% on the net export sales towards Refractory License and Systems License
    respectively i.e. for both the product and process. During the course of hearing, it was
    learnt that-such royalty payment is being made by the assessee on the products identified
    as 'viso' and 'Slidegate' to its AEs, on which both the Refractory License rate and Systems
    License rate are applicable. In other words, the assessee in reality is actually paying
    royalty at the rate of 5% [3% + 2%] on net domestic sales and 8% [3%+5%] on the net
    export sales.
    In order to verify the arm`s length nature of the assessee`s international transaction
    with respect to royalty payment, a search analysis was conducted by the TPO
    using the Royalty Statdatabase which is mentioned on page 31 of order of ld
    CIT(A).
    4. During the TPO proceedings, the assessee in its reply dated 31.10.2011 has
    submitted that with respect to the royalty agreement between stone Mountain
    finishes, Inc, and special Shrine surfaces, Es3 Inc, the assessee has claimed that
    the royalty rate should be considered at 7% on sales which has been shown as 5%
    [on the royalty stat database] based on the following:
    Sl. No.   Sale of value of products                                  Rate of royalty payable
    1.        Upto $ 50 million                                          7%
    2.        More than $ 50 million &upto $ 150 million                 6%
    3.        More than $ 150 million &upto $ 300 million                5%
    4.        More than $ 300 million &upto $ 600 million                4%
    5.        Above $ 600 million                                        3%
    The assessee has contended that if the assessee's sale of products liable to royalty
    is considered within $ 50 million, then the royalty rate/or Stone Mountain
    Finishes, Inc, should be considered as 7% instead of 5%.
                                                                                                     Pa g e | 4
                                                                                    M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                  I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                    I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8
                                          A s se s smen t Yea r s: 2 0 0 8 - 0 9 , 2 0 0 9 - 1 0 & 2 0 1 0 - 1 1
    However, Ld TPO did not accept the contention of the assessee on the ground that
    the assessee has not provided any reasoning for its claim. In fact, the rate of 5%
    provided on the database was the average rate of royalty payable, hence the rate as
    available on the database is reasonable. In view of the same, the assessee's request
    for computation of the average rate to 4.75% instead of 4.25% was rejected. The
    assessee has also further submitted that the regulatory authority in India have
    permitted payment of royalty at 5% on domestic sales and 8% on export sales. The
    conditions imposed by the regulatory authority in India regarding payment of
    royalty are governed by other consideration other than taxation issues. It is linked
    to the fund inflow-outflow from the country, forex reserve management and other
    broader economic parameters. The rate is not determined from the perspective of
    arm's length principle which is a principle of taxation and hence any limits
    specified by the regulatory authorities may not be a correct benchmark to
    determine the arm's length price of an international transaction.
    5 Therefore, the ld. TPO rejected the submissions of the assessee and computed
    the arm's length price of royalty, observing the followings:
                                                                                                   Pa g e | 5
                                                                                      M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                    I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                      I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8
                                            A s se s smen t Yea r s: 2 0 0 8 - 0 9 , 2 0 0 9 - 1 0 & 2 0 1 0 - 1 1
    This way, the ld TPO, by using the CUP method, computed the arm`s length price
    (ALP) to the tune of Rs. 1,18,83,649/-.
    6. Aggrieved by the addition made by the TPO/AO, the assessee carried the matter
    in appeal before the ld. CIT(A), who has deleted the addition made by the
    TPO/AO observing the following:
           "1. I have carefully considered the arguments of the ld. TPO and the submissions
           offered by the ld. A/Rs for the assessee. After careful examination, I find that the
           impugned adjustment made by the learned TPO is based on an incorrect
           approach of the situation and an incorrect approach towards the impugned
           transactions. I am of the considered view that this adjustment is not sustainable.
           2.The ld. TPO has furnished 4 comparable agreements, the arithmetic mean rate
           of royalty of which is 4.25%. It was contended by the assessee that in view of the
           incorrect selection of the comparables, the arm's length price determined by the
           ld. TPO is improper. I find that the various cases relied upon by the ld. TPO
           cannot be considered as a comparable with terms and scope of royalty payment
           by the assessee to its AEs. They are different in respect of scope, geographical
           locations and industries / sector. The agreements relied on by the ld. TPO deals
           with Biotechnology and Drugs Industry Refuse System Industry and Motor &
           Generators Industry, whereas the assessee operates in the Refractory Industry.
           Therefore, the case relied upon by the learned TPO cannot be considered as a
           comparable.
           3.The comparable agreements submitted by the assessee ld. A.Rs have been duly
           considered by me and from the perusal of the same it can be said the rate of
           royalty paid by the assessee is at arm's length. In view of the above discussion, I
           hold that the adjustment made by the ld. TPO was improper. Accordingly, the
           same are required to be deleted."
    7. Aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A), the revenue is in appeal before us.
                                                                                                     Pa g e | 6
                                                                                   M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                 I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                   I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8

    8. The ld. DR for the Revenue has primarily reiterated the stand taken by the
    Assessing Officer which we have already noted in our earlier para and the same is
    not being repeated for the sake of brevity and on the other hand the ld. Counsel for
    the assessee has defended the order of the ld. CIT(A).
    9. We have heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission put
    forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the case
    laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings of the ld
    CIT(A) and other materials available on record. We note that Vesuvius India
    Limited, is a public limited company engaged in the business of manufacture and
    sale of refractories. During the year, the assessee               had entered into various
    international transactions with its Associated Enterprises ('AEs'). During the
    proceedings before the Ld. TPO, various details, information & explanations
    (including transfer pricing documentation study report) as requisitioned were filed
    before the Ld. TPO in support of arm's length nature of International Transactions
    entered into with its AEs. During the course of proceedings, the Ld. TPO has
    accepted the transactions entered into by the assessee with its AEs to be at arm's
    length except in the case of the international transaction relating to payment of
    royalty by the assessee to its AEs wherein a downward adjustment was made by
    Ld TPO to the tune of Rs. 1,18,83,649/- out of payment of royalty of Rs.
    5,34,42,085/- made by the assessee to its AEs. We note that the assessee has
    entered into a Technology License Agreement dated 28th September, 1992 read
    with Supplemental Agreement dated 1st February, 2000 read with Second
    Supplemental Agreement dated 16th April, 2007 with its Associated Enterprises
    ('AEs') i.e. Vesuvius Crucible Company, USA (herein-after referred as 'Refractory
    Licensor') & Vesuvius Group SA, Belgium (herein-after referred as 'System
    Licensor') respectively. In terms of the said agreement, Refractory & System
    Licensor has granted the assessee a license to use the Technical Information to
    manufacture and a license to use the Technical Information to market, sell and
    service the products. Further, in terms of the said agreement, the assessee has to
    pay royalty to the Refractory Licensor @ 3% on the Net Ex-factory sales price of
                                                                                                  Pa g e | 7
                                                                                    M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.

    the product sold in India and @ 5% on the FOB price of the product sold outside
    India and to the System Licensor @ 2% on the Net Ex-factory sales price of the
    product sold in India and @ 3% on the FOB price of the product sold outside
    India.
    10. We note that during the assessment year, the assessee has paid royalty to its
    AEs as follows:
    (a). To Refractory Licensor, royalty of Rs.2,47,85,557/- at the rate of 3% on the
    Net Ex- factory sales price of the product sold in India;
    (b). To Refractory Licensor, royalty of Rs. 75,83,015/- at the rate of 5% on the
    FOB price of the product sold outside India;
    (c ). To System Licensor, royalty of Rs.l,65,23,705/- at the rate of 2% on the Net
    Ex- factory sales price of the product sold in India;
    (d). To System Licensor, royalty of Rs.45,49,809/- at the rate of 3% on the FOB
    price of the product sold outside India.
    We note that Ld. TPO raised objections with respect to the arm's length nature of
    the assessee's international transaction with respect to royalty payments. The Ld.
    TPO claimed that the two separate payments made to Refractory Licensor and
    System Licensor is actually being made by the assessee on the products 'viso' and
    'Slidegate' and both the payments should be clubbed and Royalty Rates should be
    5%[3% + 2%] on net domestic sales and 8%[3% + 5%] on the net export sales.
    The Ld. TPO relied on royalty payment data relating to certain companies
    extracted from 'Royaltystats.com' database and asked the assessee to show-cause
    that why adjustment should not be made in case of the assessee based on the said
    royalty data. The Ld. TPO computed the average rate of royalty payment by the
    alleged comparable agreements at 4.25% on net sales as against assessee's
    payment of royalty.
    Before the Ld. TPO, it was submitted by the assessee that the assessee has
    receivedsubstantial benefits by paying royalty to its AEs which outweighs the
                                                                                                   Pa g e | 8
                                                                                  M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7

    quantum of royalty payable. Further, it was also submitted that the said royalty
    rates were within the limits prescribed by the Govt. vide its Press Note 2 (2003
    Series) dated 24th June, 2003 (5% on domestic sales & 8% on export sales). The
    assessee questioned on the comparable agreements selected by the Ld. TPO, as
    the companies between whom those agreements were entered were different in
    respect of Scope, Geographical Location, Industry and Terms of Payment etc. as
    compared to the assessee's royalty agreements with its AEs. Further, the assessee
    computed the effective rate of payment of royalty applying the same basis (Net
    Sales) as considered by the Ld. TPO in the aforesaid agreements. The effective
    rate of payment of royalty works out to be 4.18% and 4.62% on net domestic sales
    & exports respectively against 5% and 8% on Net Ex-factory Sales Price and FOB
    respectively. Thus, the assessee submitted that no adjustments should be warranted
    if the same basis is considered by the Ld. TPO as in the comparable agreements.
    Further, in one of the comparable selected by the Ld. TPO, Stone Mountain
    Finishes, Inc. USA, the rate of royalty should have been considered @ 7% instead
    of 5% considering the assessee's turnover and thus, the average rate as computed
    would have stand increased to 4.75% instead of 4.25%. Further, the assessee
    submitted that the two royalty payments against Refractory Licensor and System
    Licensor shouldn't be clubbed as each of the two agreements have separate
    identifiable deliverables and should be compared individually for benchmarking.
    Further, the assessee also applied the overall TNMM contending that since its
    margin are higher that the margins earned by the industry, its international
    transaction (including payment of royalty) are at arm's length. The assessee
    submitted that it has been able to earn higher margins than the industry standards
    which have been possible due to technical assistance, support from the AEs, thus
    justifying the payments. We note that the Ld. TPO, rejected the contentions and
    submissions of the assessee and held that the assessee has not submitted any
    alternative search to prove that the royalty payment made by the assessee during
    the relevant A.Y. 2008-09 is at arm's length and accordingly determined ALP
    mean rate of royalty @ 4.25% on net domestic & export sales furnished by the
                                                                                                 Pa g e | 9

                                                                 I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7

    assessee. Thus, the ld. TPO proposed a downward adjustment of Rs. 1,18,83,649/-
    in respect of royalty payment to its AEs.
    11. We note that     the assessee pays royalty pursuant to Technology License
    Agreement dated 28th September, 1992 read with Supplemental Agreement dated
    1st February, 2000 read with Second Supplemental Agreement dated 16th April,
    2007 between VIL and Vesuvius Crucible Company ("Refractory Licensor" or
    "VCC") and Vesuvius Group S.A. ("Systems Licensor''). The assessee had entered
    into a "Technology License Agreement" dated 28th day of September, 1992 with
    Refractory Licensor. In terms of the said agreement VCC, who is the owner & has
    the right to license valuable proprietary technical information and to provide

          components to the degree that licensor utilizes such testing quality
          assurance methods.
    12. We also note that the said agreement, at Article XIII, provides that VCC shall
    license the assessee to use the Trademarks in connection with the marketing and
    sale of products outside India. Further, as per Article XIV the term of this
    agreement is for a period of seven years from the commencement of commercial
    production provided the commercial production is not delayed beyond three years
    from the date of the agreement. However, Article XVI on "Effect of Termination"
    states that on expiry of the agreement all obligations undertaken by VCC and the
    assessee shall terminate except inter alia that the licenses granted by VCC to the
    assessee, provided however, that such licenses shall thereafter be non-exclusive
    and no further Technical Information shall be disclosed by VCC to the assessee.
    However, VCC has under a separate sales agreement sold to Systems Licensor, the
    entire engineering activities inclusive of the rights, designs and know how,
    registered or unregistered. The assessee was interested to maintain the right to use
    the know how in producing the refractory products as well as to sell the refractory
                                                                                                 Page | 11

    products for use on any engineered systems previously developed by VCC or to be
    developed in future by VSA. Thus, with effect from 01-02-2000, further to the
    Technology License Agreement, a Supplemental Agreement between the assessee
    and Refractory Licensor & System Licensor was entered into to enable the
    assessee continued availability of technical information & related assistance, use
    of trademarks, patents etc. The said agreement was further extended by another
    supplemental agreement dated 16thApril, 2007. During the previous year relevant
    to the A. Y. 2008-09, the assessee has paid royalty to the Refractory Licensor @ of
    3% on the Net Ex-factory sales price of the product sold in India and at rate of 5%
    on the FOB price of the product sold outside India and to the System Licensor @
    2% on the Net Ex-factory sales price of the product sold in India and at rate of 3%
    on the FOB price of the product sold outside India. Further, in terms of the
    aforesaid Supplementary Agreements, systems shall mean all mechanical
    equipment, measurement devices, hydraulic systems & manipulators, automation
    systems & process development designed by or for which the rights to design and
    know-how are owned by the Systems Licensor for blast furnace, basic oxygen
    furnaces, electric arc furnace, ladle and tundish or other measurement systems for
    use of the products as well as any and all new development and findings,
    improvements and upgrading of such mechanical equipment and measurement
    devices. Further, in terms of the said supplementary agreements, the assessee has
    been granted the right to supply the products on mechanical equipments or
    measurement devices designed or for which the rights to design and know how is
    owned by System Licensor. Thus, after the Supplemental Agreements, the
    Refractory Licensor granted a non-exclusive license to use the Technical
    Information to manufacture and a non-exclusive license to use the Technical
    Information to market, sell and service the products in India. The System Licensor
    granted a non-exclusive right to supply the Products for use in the systems for
    which it owns the right of design, know how or any other intellectual property,
    right and to supply the product in any and all new developments, improvements

       • Provision to the assessee with all new development and findings,
          improvements and upgrading of such mechanical equipment and
          measurement devices.
    As stated above, the assessee has been paying royalty for ongoing technical
    support received from its AEs in relation to various products. The product in
    respect of which the assessee has been paying royalty, are meant to be used on
    sophisticated systems like blast furnace, slide gate machineries etc. the
                                                                                                 Page | 13

    assesseefrom time to time refers various issues and queries to its group companies
    and receives support from them. It may be noted that the queries may not only be
    referred specifically to the System Licensor or Refractory Licensor but are also
    referred to any of its group companies. It is worthwhile to note that the assessee
    enjoys technical support because of its association with the Vesuvius Group for
    which it pays Royalty. Further, the counsel submits that Vesuvius Group has
    been engaged extensively in Research and Development (R&D) and has been
    constantly developing new products and systems. Over the years, through its own
    R&D and through various vertical acquisitions, Vesuvius Group has various
    patents at its name. The ld. Counsel for the assessee submits that the products in
    relation to which royalty has been paid are not standardized products and are to be
    designed based on customer specific requirements. Every time the assessee
    receives a new product enquiry, the specifications are sent to refractory licensor
    who provide technical details to the assessee to enable it to manufacture the
    requisite product as per the Vesuvius' standards. The aforesaid services are
    available on as and when needed by the assessee.
    Further, the assessee has received online supports and other technical up-
    gradation emails, copies of which were also enclosed in the TP Document Study
    Report (Refer page no. 107-121 of the Paper Book). Thus ld counsel submits that
    the assessee pays royalty for on-going, ever-flowing and comprehensive bouquet
    of services (such as technical support, information, upgrades, use of trade-marks,
    patents, Vesuvius brand etc.). The benefits received by the assessee due to its
    association with AEs for outweighs the quantum of royalty payable @ 3% & 5%
    to Refractory Licensor and @ 2% & 3% to System Licensor on domestic &exports
    sales of certain specified products. Thus, it is submitted that the royalty payment to
    it AE's are at arm's length in view of the benefits received by the assessee. Based
    on the aforesaid, the ld Counsel submits that payment to Refractory & System
    Licensors should not be clubbed together and viewed separately while undertaking
    any comparative analysis since the Refractory Licensor and Systems Licensor

    and each of the two agreements have separate identifiable deliverables. So, both
    must be compared individually for benchmarking.
    14.    We note that royalty data of various companies obtained from
    Royaltystats.com and used by TPO for applying CUP method are different from
    products, terms & scope of royalty payments made by the appellant and
    accordingly, application of CUP method by the TPO for determining ALP is not as
    per the law as held by the Hon'ble Jurisdictional Tribunal in the case of Akzo
    Nobel Chemicals (India) Ltd. v. DCIT [ITA No. 1477/PN/2010] & DCIT v.
    Emami Limited [ITA Nos.1065 & 1066/Kol/2017]. That being so, we decline to
    interfere with the order of Id. C.I T.(A) in deleting the aforesaid additions. His
    order on this addition is, therefore, upheld and the grounds of appeal of the
    Revenue are dismissed.
    15. The Ground No. 3 and 4 of ITA No. 206/Kol/2018 and Ground No. 1 and 2 in
    ITA No.207/Kol/2018 are common which are raised by the revenue inA.Y. 2009-
    10 & 2010-11respectively,relate to transfer pricing adjustment with respect to
    payment for management services to AE in INR 3,10,48,978/-. Since this issue is
    common in these two appeals therefore, we take lead case in I.T.A. No.
    207/Kol/2018 for A.Y. 2010-11.
    16. Brief facts qua the issue are that the assessee has, inter alia, availed services in
    the nature of sales, marketing, VIP support, human resources, etc. from its AE,
    Vesuvius Group S.A., Belgium vide service agreement (SA) dated 22.02.2008
    (INR 3,10,48,978/-). The aforesaid transaction was duly benchmarked by applying
    Cost plus method (CPM) wherein the assessee was charged a mark-up of 5% on
    the management service fees allocated to the assessee. Without prejudice, the
    assessee had also applied the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) to
    contend that the transaction was made at Arm length's price (ALP). The TPO
    rejecting all the contentions raised by the assessee disallowed and made
                                                                                                   Page | 15
                                                                                     M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                   I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7

    adjustment of amount of INR Rs.3,10,48,978/- by way of Transfer Pricing
    Adjustment on the following grounds:
    a) The services provided by the AE of the assessee under the SA fall into the
    category of stewardship activity;
    b) Services provided by the AE of the assessee under the SA were general
    supervisory activities which assisted the AE to control the activities of the
    assessee;
    c) Payments made by the assessee to the Group was not commensurate to the
    benefits received by the assessee for which huge payment would have been made
    had the services would have been provided by a third party to the assessee or
    performed by the assessee in-house.
    d) Services were rendered to the assessee by the Group because of the ownership
    interest and were duplicative in nature          and provided indirect benefits to the
    assessee.
    Thus, Ld TPO made adjustment of INR 3,10,48,978/-.
    17. Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer/ TPO, the assessee carried the
    matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A) who has deleted the addition made by the
    Assessing Officer observing the following:
          "1. I have carefully considered the arguments of the ld. TPO and the submissions
          offered by the ld. A.R.s of the appellant company. After careful examination, I find
          that the impugned adjustment made by the ld. TPO is based on an incorrect
          approach of the situation and an incorrect approach towards the impugned
          transactions. I am of the considered view that this adjustment is not sustainable.
          The TPO did not mention any reasons rejecting the method of benchmarking
          applied by the appellant and also did not apply any of the methods prescribed for
          benchmarking.
          2. A voluminous set of documentary evidence such as sample evidences of
          communications, training manuals, and other relevant documents was submitted
          with the ld. TPO. The documentary evidence shows valuable commercial services
          received from AE. It is also not disputed that the management services was
          rendered exclusively for the Appellant Group, and that similar services was not
          provided to any third party. The appellant through execution of the agreement
          had has reaped benefits of operational efficiency, accounting & management
          reporting efficiency.
          3. The Ld. TPO did not consider the plethora of facts, justifications, details &
          arguments as presented by the appellant and proceeded on the basis that
                                                                                                   Page | 16
                                                                                       M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                     I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                       I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8
                                             A s se s smen t Yea r s: 2 0 0 8 - 0 9 , 2 0 0 9 - 1 0 & 2 0 1 0 - 1 1
           justbecause the Group Co. wanted to control its interest, allocated the cost to the
           appellant and therefore the services are in the nature of stewardship services.
           This approach of the Ld. TPO was erroneous.
           4. As per the definition of intra-group service as per the US Regulations, first
           there should be an activity performed by one of the members of a group of related
           parties which lies within the ambit of definition of activity (the 'activity test') and
           second, that activity should result in a benefit (the 'benefit test') to one or more
           members of that group of related entities. In the interest of economy & efficiency,
           the appellant desired to obtain these services from its AE. It is the practice of the
           multinational to frequently concentrate various activities for the benefit of the
           entire group.
           5. By availing the intragroup services, there has been substantial savings in total
           costs when compared with those which would otherwise be incurred if they were
           borne by the individual companies in various countries. It is not disputed by the
           TPO that had the appellant not received support from AE, it would need to
           perform the functions in-house or hire experienced and trained service providers.
           Such services are thus not in nature of simple oversight functions which have been
           performed to protect the interest in the Group. For the purpose of determination
           and explanation, the appellant has submitted documents evidencing the regular
           flow of valuable commercial services. From the above details submitted by the
           assessee it has been amply demonstrated that the benefits generated by the said
           services during the relevant financial year have undeniably added economic /
           commercial value to enhance the commercial position of the assessee and such
           services are received by the assessee on a continuous basis across its operational
           areas. Hence it is erroneous to classify the services to be in the nature of
           stewardship services.
           6. The appellant during the course of hearing has submitted the decisions of Akzo
           Nobel India Limited vs DCIT [ITA No. 531/Kol/2014 & ITA No. 335/Kol/2014]
           &NLC ,Nalco (Indial Limited vs, DCIT [2016] 71 taxmann.com 57 (Kolkata -
           Trib.) by Hon'ble Jurisdictional ITAT. On perusal of the same, I am of the view
           that the appellant's case is squarely covered by these decisions and that the
           nature of services are not in the nature of stewardship activities and accordingly,
           the arm's length price of the transactions cannot be determined at NIL .
           In view of the above, the adjustment made by the ld. TPO / AO is not sustainable
           on the facts of the case, and the law applicable. The same is directed to be
           deleted, and as a result, this ground of appeal stands allowed."
    18. Aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A), the revenue is in appeal before us.
    19. The ld. DR for the Revenue has primarily reiterated the stand taken by the
    Assessing Officer which we have already noted in our earlier para and the same is
    not being repeated for the sake of brevity and on the other hand the ld. Counsel for
    the assessee has defended the order of the ld. CIT(A).
                                                                                                     Page | 17

    20. We have heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission put
    forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the case
    laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings of the ld
    CIT(A) and other materials available on record. We note that the ld. CIT(A) after
    considering the submissions of the assessee had decided the matter in favour of the
    assessee based on the following observations:
    a) The assessee has reaped benefits of operational efficiency, accounting &
    management reporting efficiency through the execution of the agreement.
    b) The services rendered by the AE were not in the nature of stewardship
    activities.
    Ld Counsel submitted that appellant had entered into a Service Agreement (SA)
    dated 22-02-2008 with its AE, i.e. Vesuvius Group S.A, Belgium (VGSA) for
    provision of various management and support services. In terms of Article 3 of the
    SA, VGSA has provided various services to the appellant under the following
    categories:
       • Sales, Marketing, VIP Support
       • Human Resources;
       • Manufacturing, Engineering Developments; &
       • Finance, Information Systems, Business Support & Development.
    In terms of Article 4 of the SA, the appellant has agreed and undertaken to pay a
    Service fee for Specific and Shared Services. Further, in terms of the said Article,
    all direct and indirect cost incurred by VGSA in rendering such Services shall be
    broken into the following 3 service categories, including all costs of personnel,
    depreciation of equipment, outside services and overheads expenses:
       • Marketing, VIP and technical sales support (Service Category - 1')
                                                                                                  Page | 18
                                                                                    M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
                                                                  I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7
                                                                    I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2 0 1 8

       • Human Resources support (Service Category - 2)
       • Finance, Information Systems, Business support and development,
             manufacturing, Engineering developments,(Service Category - 3)
    The basis of charge for Specific and Shared services were as under:
    For Specific Services: On Cost Basis or the basis of man days @ Euro 2000/1500
    for senior management/other employees respectively.
    For Shared Services: On the basis of pre-defined allocation keys:
    Service Category - 1 : On the basis of appellant's Direct sales vs. Vesuvius
    Division consolidated Direct sales;
    Service Category - 2: On the basis-of appellant's Personnel costs vs. Vesuvius
    Division's consolidated Personnel costs, excluding HQ costs
    Service Category - 3 : On the basis of appellant's Net Assets vs. Vesuvius
    Division's consolidated Net Assets after deduction of stewardship costs.
    A mark-up of 5% is applied on the portion of allocated services after exclusion of
    external service fees and consultations allocated at cost subject to the condition that
    total amount of fees charged by VGSA shall not exceed 1 Mio. Euros on an annual
    basis.
    We note that during the year, the appellant has availed management services from
    its AE amounting to Rs. 3,10,48,978/ - (including payment for specific services
    amounting to Rs. 26,48,778/-, (pb.9). The appellant had applied TNNM to
    benchmark the said transaction where the weighted average, operating industry
    margin on turnover (MOT) & margin on cost (MOC) was 16.98% and 20.45%
    respectively while the appellant was operating with MOT of 19.19% and MOC of
    23.74% respectively [PB page 23-43 at Pg No. 39]. The appellant was charged a
    mark-up of 5% on the management service fees allocated to the appellant. It is
                                                                                                  Page | 19

    submitted that the weighted average margin on turnover in case of companies
    engaged in providing similar services is 15.23%(pb.43), which is much higher than
    the mark-up of 5% charged from the appellant and hence the said transaction is at
    ALP.In terms of the provision of Sec. 92C(3), the TPO can proceed to determine
    the ALP only on fulfilment of the conditions specified in Clause (a) to (d) of the
    said section. In the absence of any default in complying with the conditions as
    specified in provisions of 92C(3), rejection of appellant's benchmarking [by
    applying CPM read with TNMM] is not permissible under the law. For that
    assessee relied on the following CBDT circulars and precedents:
       • CBDT'S Circular 12 of 2001 dated 23 rdAugust, 2001
       • CBDT's Circular 14 of 2001 dated 22nd November 2001

    Besides, services are not in nature of shareholder activity nor stewardship
    activities, asthe Email correspondences submitted [PB page 69-190] substantiate
    that the services are in the nature of Intra-group services (Para 7.14 of OECD
    Guidelines).That being so, we decline to interfere in the order passed by the ld.
    CIT(A), his order on this issue, is hereby upheld and ground nos. 1 , 2 in ITA No.
    207/KOl/2018 and ground no. 3 and 4 in ITA No. 206/Kol/2018 raised by the
    revenue are dismissed.
    Other Grounds
    21. Ground Nos. 1 and 2 raised by the assessee in I.T.A. No. 1289/Kol/2017, for
    A.Y.2008-09 and Ground No. 2 raised by the Revenue in I.T.A. No.
    1333/Kol/2017 for A.Y. 2008-09 are identical and common therefore we

    adjudicate them together. Revenue`s appeal in I.T.A. No. 1333/Kol/2017 for A.Y.
    2008-09 is taken as the lead case. The Grounds of appeal raised by the Assessee
    and Revenue are as follows:
          (Assessee) I.T.A. No. 1289/Kol/2017 for A.Y. 2008-09
          1. That on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A)
             was not justified and grossly erred in not allowing deduction in respect
             of leave encashment on provision basis amounting to Rs. 34,33,302/-.
          2. That on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A)
             was not justified and grossly erred in not allowing deduction in respect
             of provision for leave encashment adjusted with the opening general
             reserve and deferred tax assets as per AS-15 (Revised 2005) amounting
             to Rs. 44,97,000/-.
          ( Revenue)I.T.A. No. 1333/Kol/2017 for A.Y. 2008-09
          2. Whether the ld. CIT(A) was correct in deleting the addition without
          appreciating the fact that the provisioning has been made in the A.Y. 2008-
          09 in respect of a claim of an expense pertaining to an earlier year and the
          said provisioning having not been debited to the P & L account but to the
          Reserve Account could not have been allowed as business deduction for the
          A.Y. 2008-09? Was not the ld. CIT(A) incorrect in not following the
          decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Tuticorin Alkali
          Chemicals vs. CIT (227 ITR 172) in which the Hon'ble Court has held that
          even if there is an accounting practice for revenue recognition if it does not
          agree with the provisions of the Income Tax Act it has to be ignored?
    22. Facts
of the case which can be stated quite shortly are as follows:During the
assessment proceedings, the assessing officer examined the books of accounts
and computation of the assessee and noticed that the assessee had debited
provision for leave encashment amounting to Rs.34,33,302/- in its profit and
loss account. During the course of hearing, the assessee was asked to explain
as to why the said provision for leave encashment should not be disallowed. In
response, the assessee vide its letter dated 23.12.2011 has submitted that the
provision was claimed as deduction on the basis of decision of Hon'ble
Calcutta High Court in the case of Exide Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India
(2007) 292 ITR 470 (Cal) wherein it has been held that insertion of clause (f)
in section 43B and restricting the deduction in respect of leave encashment,
which is otherwise a trading Pa g e | 2 1 M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.

liability, is arbitrary, unconscionable and de hors the Supreme court's
decision in the case of Bharat Earth Movers vs. CIT (2000) 245 ITR 428 (SC).
The assessee has further submitted that Apex Court vide its interim order no.
CC12060 / 2008 dated 08.09.2008 has stayed the said order of Exide Industries
Ltd. (supra) and vide the subsequent order no. 22889/2008 dated 08.05.2009
clarified that the assessee is entitled to lodge the claim in the return after
payment of taxes. Based on the above, no disallowance u/s 43B is offered on
account of provision for leave encashment.
However, the AO rejected the contention of the assessee and held that actual
payment has not been made by the assessee before the due date, therefore the
provision for leave encashment amounting to Rs. 34,33,302/- was disallowed.
23\. AO`s observation about AS-15 adjustment are as follows.On perusal of
computation of total income furnished by the assessee, it was noticed by the
AO that the assessee has claimed an amount of Rs.1,95,78,000/- as deduction in
its computation of total income on account of amount arising upon
reinstatement of employees benefit obligation on account of Accounting
Standard (AS)-15 adjustment. The said amount has not been debited to Profit &
Loss Account and has not been routed through general Ledger in the Balance
Sheet.The assessee was asked to explain the same. In response, the assessee
has submitted the explanation in respect of the said claim. It has been
explained that during the year under consideration the assessee has accounted
for the employee retirement benefit as per Accounting Standard-15 "Accounting
for retirement benefit". In accordance with the transitional provision in the
revised Accounting Standard-15, Rs.1,95,78,000/- representing charge for
employee benefit obligation for earlier years up to March 31, 2007, has been
created partly by debiting the general reserve and deferred tax asset
accounts. In this regard the details of the provisions for employee retirement
benefit of Rs.1,95,78,000/- created as per AS-15 is shown as follows:-

24\. Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, the assessee carried the
matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A), who has partly deleted the addition
made by the Assessing Officer observing the following:
> Pa g e | 2 3 M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
I TA No s.1 3 3 3 &1 2 8 9 / Ko l /2 0 1 7 I TA No s.2 0 6 & 2 0 7 / Ko l / 2

Findings of ld. CIT(A) in respect of provision for leave encashment: "I have
considered the findings of the ld. Assessing Officer and the written
submission and case laws/ judicial precedents filed by the ld. A.R.s. The
provision for leave encashment is specifically covered by clause (f) of Sec.
43B and deduction for the same can be allowed only on payment basis.
2\. The assessee challenged the disallowance of provision of leave encashment
relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Exide Industries Ltd
v. UOI-292 ITR 470 (Cal) and also the judgment of Kerala High Court in
Hindustan Latex Products. It is true that the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court has
struck down provision of sec. 43B(f) while deciding he case of Exide
Industries v. Union of India 292 ITR 470 (Cal). However, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of CIT v. M/s Exide Industries Ltd. in SLP (Civil). CC
12060/2008 during hearing on 8.9.2008 rendered the following order: -
"Upon hearing counsel the Court made the following order, Issue notice, in the
meantime, there shall be stay of the impugned judgment, until further orders.
"
3\. The Hon'ble Supreme Court during the hearing in the same case further on
8.5.2009 held as under: -
"upon hearing counsel the court made the following order :'- Delay condoned.
Leave granted. Pending hearing and final disposal of the Civil appeal,
Department is restrained from recovering penalty and interest which has
accrued till date. It is made clear that as for as the outstanding interest
demand as of date is concerned, it would be open to the Department to recover
that amount in case Civil Appeal of the Department is allowed.
We further make it clear that the assessee would during the pendency of this
Civil appeal, pay tax as if Section 43B(f) is on the Statute Book but at the
same time it would be entitled to make a claim in its returns. "
4\. Thus, vide order dated 8.9.2008 in CIT v. Exide Industries Ltd. the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had granted stay on the High Court judgment and further
order. In the subsequent order dated 8.5.2009 in petition for special leave to
appeal (Civil) No. 22889/2008, it was directed by Hon'ble Supreme Court that
during the pendency of the civil appeal, the assessee would pay tax as if
section43B(f) is on the statute book though it would be entitled to make claim
in the return. In my considered view the stay granted earlier has not been
vacated by the Hon'ble apex court. Therefore, I do not agree with the assessee
that Hon'ble Supreme Court has not stayed the order of Hon'ble High Court, as
the stay granted vide order dated 8.9.2008 continues to remain in force.
Coming now to the other contention of the assessee, generally speaking it is
true, that stay of an order of lower court affects only the parties of the
concerned suit and the stay does not necessarily mean that ratio of the order
of lower court does not remain in force. However, the issue under
consideration in the case of Exide Industries Ltd. (supra) was the very
legality and constitutional validity of the provisions, and therefore the
Hon'ble Court order has wider ratification and its scope is not limited only
to the parties to the suit. Therefore, the order of High Court in the case of
Exide Industries Ltd. (supra) is at present not operational. Rather, the
provision of section 43B(f) is to be considered to be in force keeping in view

the interim order of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Considering this legal position,
with due respect to Hon'ble High Court, I am following the interim order of
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Considering the same this ground taken by the assessee
is dismissed, with a rider that this order is subject to modification in a
situation whether the Hon'ble Apex Court ultimately decides the issue in
favour of the assessee."
Finding of ld. CIT(A) in respect of AS-15 Adjustments: "I have carefully
considered the findings of the ld. Assessing Officer and the written
submission and case laws filed by the ld. A.R.s for the assessee. The
assessee-company has made provision for employee benefits by adjusting the
opening General Reserve and deferred tax assets in accordance with Accounting
Standard-15 (revised-2005). The ld. Assessing Officer had disallowed the same
on the reasoning that the impugned expenses do not pertain to the year under
consideration and that provisions are contingent in nature. The ld. AR.s have
submitted that the provisions have been made because of the applicability of
the Revised AS-15, and that the expenses which crystallized during the
relevant assessment year are to be allowed in the current year.
2\. Further, the aforesaid provisions have been worked out as per the
Actuarial Valuation Report. Copy of Actuarial Valuation Reports has also been
duly submitted by the. Ld. A.R. along with the Written Submissions. Therefore,
the said provisions cannot be said to be contingent in nature. The various
items are decided along the following lines:
3\. Provision for Post-Retirement Medical Scheme of Rs.98,82,000/-. I find
that this issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee-company by the
decisions of the Hon'ble Tribunal in Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd.
-vs.- ACIT (2013) 36 CCH 21 (Chd) and Bokaro Power Supply Co. (P) Ltd. -vs.-
DCIT (2013) 35 CCH 293 (Del). This issue is accordingly allowed in favour of
the assessee.
4\. As regards the Provision for Gratuity of Rs.51,99,000/-, it was submitted
by the Ld. A.R. that the payment for the same has already been made during the
relevant previous year and as per the provisions of sub-section (b) of
Sec,43B, gratuity is allowable in the year in which payment is made. The Ld.
AO is thereby directed to verify the payment, and where the contention of the
assessee found correct, to allow the same. Accordingly, this item of expense
is allowed for statistical purpose.
5\. Provision for leave encashment of Rs.44,97,000/-: Provision for leave
encashment is specifically covered by clause (f) of Sec. 43B and deduction for
the same can be allowed only on payment basis. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court vide its interim order dated 08-09-2008 and 08-05-2009 against the order
of Exide Industries Ltd. (2007) 292 ITR 470 (Cal) has allowed the operation of
Sec. 43B(f) to continue until further orders. Accordingly, this claim of the
assessee is not tenable, and requires to be dismissed, subject to such finding
being amenable for modification in a situation where the Hon'ble Apex Court
ultimately decides the issue in favour of the assessee."
25\. Aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A), the Assessee is in appeal
before us against the addition confirmed by CIT(A), in respect of provision of
leave encashment of Rs. 34,33,302/-.

Whereas the Revenue is in appeal before us against the partly relief granted
by CIT(A) in respect of, transitional provision as per AS-15, for post
retirement medical scheme of Rs. 98,82,000/-, transitional provision as per
AS-15, for gratuity of Rs. 51,99,000/- and transitional provision as per
AS-15, for leave encashment of Rs. 54,97,000/-, ( Note: these transitional
provisions were created on account of adoption of revised Accounting Standard
-15, by assessee).
26\. The ld. DR for the Revenue has primarily reiterated the stand taken by
the Assessing Officer which we have already noted in our earlier para and the
same is not being repeated for the sake of brevity.
27\. On the other hand, the ld. Counsel for the assessee submitted before us
that during the previous year relevant to the assessment year under
consideration, the assessee has made provision for employee benefit of
Rs.l,95,78,000/- by adjusting the opening general reserve and deferred tax
assets in accordance with Accounting Standard -15 (Revised 2005) "Employee
Benefits". The aforesaid provision of Rs. 1,95,78,000/- comprises of provision
for post retirement medical scheme of Rs. 98,82,000/-, provision for gratuity
of Rs.51,99,000/- and provision for leave encashment of Rs.44,97,000/-. The
aforesaid provision for employee benefits is made as per the actuarial
valuation. In this regard a copy of the actuarial valuation report in respect
of provision for post retirement medical scheme, provision for gratuity and
provision for leave encashment has already been furnished during the appellate
stage before the ld CIT(A). As regard provision for gratuity which is only
allowable on payment basis as per Sec. 43B(b), the ldCounsel submitted that
the same has also been paid during the yearunder consideration and hence
allowable u/s 43B of the Act. The ld. Counsel for the assessee also submitted
that the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India had revised Accounting
Standard - 15 in 2005. The objective of AS-15 (revised) is to prescribe the
accounting and disclosure for employee benefits. The Statement requires an
enterprise to recognize:

(a) a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange for employee
benefits to be paid in the future; and
(b) an expense when the enterprise consumes the economic benefit arising from
service provided by an employee in exchange for employee benefits.
As per AS-15 (revised), post employment benefit plan i.e. pension, etc are
classified as either 'Defined Benefit Scheme' or 'Defined Contribution
Scheme'. Under 'Defined benefit scheme' an enterprise obligation is to provide
the agreed benefits to current and former employees. The actuarial risk and
investment fall in substance on the employee. The AS-15 (revised) provides in
detail about the actuarial valuation method and actuarial assumptions to be
used for measuring the liability for employee benefits under the 'Defined
Benefit Scheme'. This way, ld Counsel defended the order passed by ld CIT(A)
and prayed before the Bench to allow provision for leave encashment.
28\. We have heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission
put forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the
case laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings
of the ld CIT(A) and other materials available on record. We note that so far
Provision for Post-Retirement Medical Scheme of Rs.98,82,000/- is concerned,
we note that this issue is squarely covered in favour of the assessee company
by the decisions of the Tribunal in Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd.
-vs.- ACIT (2013) 36 CCH 21 (Chd) and Bokaro Power Supply Co. (P) Ltd. -vs.-
DCIT (2013) 35 CCH 293 (Del). We are of the view that ld CIT(A) has rightly
allowed the claim of the assessee company. That being so, we decline to
interfere with the order of ld. CIT(A) in deleting the aforesaid addition,his
order on this addition is, therefore, upheld and the grounds of appeal of the
Revenue is dismissed.
29\. As regards, provision for gratuity of Rs. 51,99,000/- adjusted with the
opening general reserve and deferred tax assets as per AS-15 (Revised 2005),
it is Pa g e | 2 7 M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.

submitted by the Counsel for the assessee that the payment for the same has
already been made during the previous year relevant to the instant assessment
year and as per the provisions of sub-section (b) of Sec 43B, gratuity is
allowable in the year in which payment is made. We note that ld CIT(A) has
already directedthe AO to verify the payment, and where the contention of the
assessee company found correct, to allow the same. Accordingly, this item of
expense was allowed by ld CIT(A) for statistical purpose. We do not find any
infirmity in the order passed by the ld CIT(A), therefore, on this issue, we
confirm the order of ld CIT(A).
30\. We note that Provision for leave encashment of Rs.44,97,000/- pertains to
transitional provisions of AS-15, and an amount of Rs. 34,33,302 pertains to
current year provision for leave encashment. We note that issue under
consideration is no longer res integra, it is covered by the judgment of the
Coordinate Bench in the case of ITC Limited, in ITA No. 1222/Kol/2015, for
A.Y. 2009-10, order dated 04.10.2017 wherein it was held as follows:
"2. The sole ground of appeal of the assessee is against the action of Ld.
CIT(A) in confirming the action of the AO in disallowing a sum of
Rs.7,32,113/- being the provision made for leave encashment in the current
assessment year on the basis of actuarial valuation.
3\. At the outset itself, the Ld. Counsel brought to our notice that the
similar issue had come up before this Tribunal in M/s. S. R. Batliboi & Co.

32\. Brief facts qua the issue are that during the assessment proceedings the
AO noticed that the assessee has incurred expenditure on club subscription and
catering service fees of Rs. 5,96,933/-. The particulars and details of these
expenses are mentioned in Clause 17(d) r.w.annexure-8 of the Tax Audit Report.
During the course of assessment proceedings, the assessee was asked to explain
how the said expense were wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of
business. In response to the same the assessee vide letter dated 09.12.2011
submitted a written reply. However,disregarding the submission made by the
assessee, the AO in the order u/s 143(3) disallowed the expenditure incurred
on club subscription and catering service fees by holding that the same is not
incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business.
33\. Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, the assessee carried the
matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A), who has deleted the addition made by
AO observing the following:
> "I have considered the findings of the ld. A.O. and the written submission
> and case laws filed by the ld. A.R. for the assessee. The ld. A.O. in the
> assessment order has disallowed this amount holding that the same was not

34\. Aggrieved by the order of the ld. CIT(A), the revenue is in appeal before
us.
35\. The ld. DR has primarily reiterated the stand taken by the Assessing
Officer which we have already noted in our earlier para and the same is not
being repeated for the sake of brevity and on the other hand, the ld. Counsel
for the assessee has defended the order of the ld. CIT(A).
36\. We have heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission
put forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the
case laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings
of the ld CIT(A) and other materials available on record. We note that the
assessee has incurred Rs.5,96,933/- towards the corporate membership of
various clubs and catering service charges. The aforesaid expenditure is
incurred to run the business more efficiently. The membership of a club gives
an opportunity to the Directors and other employees of the assessee to get
together with their business associates and in that process, advance their
business interest. The club provides platform for business interactions to
improve business relations and prospects. Thus, club membership helps in
maintaining business connection/contacts by the directors and senior
executives of the assessee and therefore constitutes revenue expenditure. We
note that the Hon`ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Gujarat State Export
Corporation Ltd -vs.- CIT (1994) 209 ITR 649 (Guj), held as under:
> "For deciding the question as to whether the expenditure is of capital
> nature or revenue nature, one of the relevant criteria is whether it is for
> acquisition of a concern or assets or whether the expenditure is for
> carrying on a concern or for running the business. If the aim and object of

> expenditure. Hence, in our view, it would be difficult for us to accept the
> contention of the Revenue that the entrance fee paid by the assessee for
> getting the membership of the sports club can be termed as capital
> expenditure. "
Therefore, we are of the view that expenditure incurred by assesseeof
Rs.5,96,933/-towards the corporate membership of various clubs and catering

37\. Ground No. 3 raised by the Revenue in I.T.A. No. 1333/ Kol/2017, reads as

38\. We note that assessing officer in his assessment order dealt the issue as
follows:
"The assessee was asked to furnish the name, address and amount in respect of
purchase parties. As the assessee did not furnish the said details, Shri
Harish Agarwal, the authorized representative was asked thefollowing vide
order sheet noting dated 02.12.2011- "Shri Agarwal was reminded of the fact
that details of sundry debtors which include purchase details have not been
filed so far and therefore, deriving the Revenue of making enquiry of
purchases. Hence, reasonable view in respect of purchases may be taken."
In response, a list of purchase parties was submitted by the assessee. In this
connection notice u/s. 133(6) was sent to M/s. OCL India Ltd at the address
12A, Stephen House, 4, B.B.D.Bag, Kolkata-700 001. In response, a letter dated

letter has been signed by Shri Chinmoy Majumder, Dy. General Manage-Accounts
which is as under:
"This is in response to your above letter directing us to produce information

Shri Haish Agarwal, A/R was confronted with the above reply received from M/s.
OCL India Ltd vide order sheet noting dated 27.12.2011. In response Shri
Agarwal, A/R of the assessee has submitted the following explanation vide
letter dated 29.12.2011:
"As regards OCL India Ltd it is humbly submitted that the party has
inadvertently stated in its letter that there was no transaction with the
assessee in the F. Y. 2007-08. In this regard copy of the ledger account of
OCL India Ltd along with the specimen copy of invoice of F. Y. 2007-08 is
marked and collectively enclosed as Annexure-7".
It is seen that the assessee has furnished the following details in respect of
M/s. OCL India Ltd. -
    Balance as on Transaction          during Payment during                  the Balance as                  on

The party M/s. OCL India Ltd has categorically denied of any transaction with
the assessee company. Since the assessee has claimed the purchase expenses
onus was always on the assessee to prove that the transaction genuine and for
the purpose of the business. Merely submitting the ledger account and photo
copy of certain documents which are not properly legible cannot make the claim
of the assessee admissible and acceptable. Hence, the above explanation of the
assessee cannot be accepted. Considering the above, the purchase expenses of
Rs. 1,61,18,861/- is disallowed and added to the total income of the
assessee."
39\. Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, the assessee carried the
matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A), who has deleted the addition observing

ledger account substantiating the genuineness of the transactions of the
assessee with OCL India Limited. On verification of the details furnished by
the assessee, the ld CIT(A) noticed that the transactions between the assessee
and OCL India Ltd. to be genuine.
We note that in the course of assessment proceedings, the AO had issued
notices u/s 133(6) to many parties with whom the assessee had transactions
during the financial year relevant to the assessment year under consideration
and asked them to furnish details of the transactions with the assessee. As
and when the replies were received from the parties the AO asked the assessee
to reconcile the closing balances if there was any difference in the balances.
In response to the same the assessee vide letter dated 23-12-2011, 28-12-2011
& 29-12-2011 submitted detailed reconciliation. However, one of the parties,
OCL India Ltd in its reply to the letter issued by the AO stated that there
was no transaction with the assessee during the financial year relevant to the
assessment year under consideration. Thereafter the assessee was asked to
provide an explanation for the same. In response to the same, the assessee
vide letter dated 29-12-2011 filed detailed reply along with the ledger copy
of OCL India Ltd and specimen copies of the invoices. The ld Counsel submitted
before us thatduring the assessment year under consideration, the assessee had
purchased items from the refractory division of OCL but the letter u/s 133(6)
was received by the cement division and the cement division without consulting
the refractory division has inadvertently replied to the aforesaid letter
stating that there was no transaction with the assessee during the aforesaid

it said that the information furnished vide letter dated 13-12-2011 declaring
that the assessee did not have any transaction pertains to the cement
division. However, OCL has agreed that the assessee had purchased refractory

33\. Ground no. 1 raised by the revenue in I.T.A. No. 206/Kol/2018 for A.Y.
2009- 10 which is reproduced below:
> 1\. The ld. CIT(A) has erred in deleting the disallowance of Rs. 23,58,959/-
> towards relining of kilnm at Mehsana unit ignoring the fact that the
> assessee itself has recognized the said expenditure as capital expenditure

> said expenditure has enduring benefit for the assessee which is squarely
> within the meaning of capital expenditure.
34\. Brief facts qua the issue are that the company had incurred an
expenditure of Rs. 23,58,959/- towards relining of kiln at its Mehsana Unit.
Vide letter dated 02- 01-2013, the assessee was asked to explain the nature of
such expenditure and explain why it shouldn't be capitalized. In response to
the same, the assessee filed reply dated 12-03-2013 which is as under:
> "In the instant assessment year, the company has incurred an expenditure of
> Rs. 23,58,959/- towards relining of kiln at its Mehsana unit. The aforesaid
> expenditure has been incurred to protect and preserve the insulation layer
> of the kiln which gets damaged and worn out on account of high temperature
> and constant wear and tear, the aforesaid expenditure is allowable as
> revenue expenditure."
The submission made by the assessee was duly examined by AO. On examination of
the computation of total income, it was noted that the assessee has separately
claimed deduction in respect of their lining expenses. It clearly shows that
the assessee has capitalized the same in the books of accounts. Assessee
itself admitted that the aforesaid expenditure has been incurred to protect
and preserve the insulation layer of the kiln which gets damaged and worn out
on account of high temperature and constant wear and tear. Further it is clear
that aforesaid Page | 36 M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.

expenditure provides long lasting benefit to the assessee by preventing the
kiln from wear and tear thereby increasing its life substantially. Hence,
there lining expenditure cannot be treated as expenditure on repair but the
same should be capitalized as done in its books of account. Thus, claim of the
assessee on account of relining expenditure of Rs. 23,58,959/- is disallowed
and added back in the computation.
35\. Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, the assessee carried the
matter in appeal before the ld. CIT(A) who has deleted the addition made by
the Assessing Officer observing the following:
> "1. I have considered the findings of the ld. A.O. and the written

38\. We have heard both the parties and carefully gone through the submission
put forth on behalf of the assessee along with the documents furnished and the
case laws relied upon, and perused the fact of the case including the findings
of the ld CIT(A) and other materials available on record. We note that the
assessee is engaged in the manufacture of refractories which are material that
can withstand very high temperatures 3000Cor more without degrading or
softening. Refractories require special heat-up techniques to ensure that they
perform as intended, and avoid damage due to drying stresses (spalling) and
thermal shock until the operational status is achieved. The manufacturing
procedure requires a number of steps to be followed which includes grinding,
mixing, moulding, drying, firing etc. The 'Firing' procedure requires
temperature which is usually higher than their usage temperature. This
'Firing' procedure is carried out in kilns. Further, on account of such high
temperature, the kiln is subject to continuous withering and damage. In order
to ensure operational efficiency of kiln it is imperative to ensure regular
relining of the walls of the kiln. This relining is required to maintain the
functioning of the kiln. Thus, this is in the nature of current repairs.
Further, it is humbly stated that expenditure on account of current repairs is
an allowable expenditure as per Sec. 31(i) or u/s 37(1) as incurred wholly and
exclusively for the purpose of business. "Current repairs" means repairs
necessary for preserving or maintaining an already existing asset which does
not bring a new asset into existence or does not give to the assessee a new or
different advantage. They are such repairs as are attended to as and when the
need for them arises. As iterated above, the said expenditure has been
incurred to protect and preserve the insulation layer of the Kiln which gets
damaged and worn out on account of high temperature and constant wear and
tear. The relining was done to preserve and maintain the existing asset and no
new asset or advantage has accrued to the appellant. Such expenditure is
allowable as revenue expenditure. Reliance in this regard is placed on the
decision in the case of Addl. CIT -vs.- Dyer's Stone Lime Co. (P) Ltd. (1982)
136 ITR 8 (Del. ) wherein it has been held that the expenditure incurred on
relining of kilns does not substantially change the identity of the plant nor
it effects any improvement in the efficiency of the plant, Pa g e | 3 8 M/s

so the same is an expenditure on current repairs and hence allowable as
revenue expenditure. Further, reliance in this regard could also placed in the
decision of CIT -vs.- Bharat Aluminum Co. Ltd. (2007) 292 ITR 600 (Del.)
wherein it has been held that relining of smelter pots undertaken by the
assessee was only meant to take care of wear and tear and it does not create
any new asset or advantage, so the same is a revenue expenditure in the nature
of current repairs. That being so, we decline to interfere in the order passed
by the ld. CIT(A), his order on this issue, is hereby upheld and the ground
no. 1 raised by the revenue is dismissed.
39\. Now we shall take ground no. 2 raised by the Revenue in ITA No.

> 2\. The ld. CIT(A) has erred in treating the LAN cabling, which is only a
> network of wire for transmission of data, as computer peripheral and
> deleting the addition on the said ground.
40\. Brief facts qua the issue are that this ground relates to disallowance
made by the ld. A.O. of an amount of Rs. 6,80,264/- on account of claim of
Depreciation @ 60% on LAN cabling'. The impugned disallowance has been made by
the ld. Assessing Officer in the assessment order by observing as follows:
> "8.1 The company also claimed depreciation @ 60% on LAN cabling in computers
> shown at Rs. 27,21,055/-. On examination of the same, it is seen that LAN

decision of Special bench of Hon'ble Mumbai ITAT in the case of DCIT vs.
Datacraft India Ltd. (2010) 40 SOT 295 (Mumbai) (SB) wherein it has been that
the computer, in common sense and as a popularly understood, refers to any
electronic or other high speed data processing device which performs 'logical,
arithmetic and memory functions on data' and includes all input and output
devices which are connected to or related to it. In order to determine whether
a particular machine can be classified as a computer or not, the predominant
function, usage and common parlance understanding, would have to be taken into
account. In order to be called as computer, it is sine-qua-non that the
principal output/object/function of such machine should be achievable only
through 'computer functions'. Accordingly, it has been held that Router and
Switchers canbe classified as computer hardware when they are used along with
a computer and when their functions are integrated with a computer. In such a
situation, routers and switchers are to be included in block of 'computer' for
purpose of determining rate of depreciation applicable to them i.e. 60%.
Reliance is also placed on the decisions in the case of Expeditors
International (India) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT (2008) 118 TTJ 652 (Del) wherein
the Hon'ble Tribunal has held that peripherals such as NT Server etc. form
integral part of computer and the same, therefore, are eligible for
depreciation at the rate of 60% as applicable to computer. Reliance in this
regard is also placed in the case of CIT vs. BSES Yamuna Power Limited
(2010-TIOL-636-HC-DEL-IT) wherein the Delhi High Court following the decision
of the Expeditors International (India) (P) Ltd. (supra) has held that:
> "We are in agreement with the view of the Tribunal that computer accessories
> and peripherals such as, printers, scanners and server etc. form an integral
> part of the computer system. In fact, the computer accessories and
> peripherals cannot be used without the computer. Consequently, as they are
> the part of the computer system, they are entitled to depreciation at the
> higher rate of 60%." [Emphasis added] Page | 41 M/s Vesuvius India Ltd.
