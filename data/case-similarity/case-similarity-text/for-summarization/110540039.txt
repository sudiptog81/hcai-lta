3\. Nikon India Private Limited (the assessee company) is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Nikon Corporation, Japan ("Nikon Japan"). The assessee company
is inter-alia engaged in import, sales and distribution for Nikon Imaging
products in India through network of local distributors. For the  3 ITA No.
5146/Del/2017 relevant Assessment Year ("AY"), the assessee company filed its
return of income on September 21, 2011 declaring income of Rs. 12,35,25,748/-.
The case of the assessee company was selected for scrutiny under section 143
(3) of the Act. During the relevant Assessment Year 2011-12 the assessee
company had following 'international transactions' with its Associated
Enterprise (AE), which were duly reported in Form 3CEB and TP Study.

                   Reimbursements
                   Paid
These transactions were accepted to be at arm's length price (ALP) by the
Transfer Pricing Officer ("TPO") / Assessing Officer. The TPO, vide order
dated 06.01.2015 observed that the assessee company was incurring excessive
Advertisement, Marketing and Promotion Expenditure (AMP) for development  4
ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 of the brand owned by its foreign AE, therefore such
excessive AMP expenditure would amount to 'international transaction'.
Consequently, adjustment of Rs. 68,50,65,162/- was made by the TPO by applying
Bright Line Test (BLT). Further, the TPO had included direct selling and
distribution expenditure within the ambit of AMP expenditure. The Assessing
Officer passed a draft assessment order dated 20.02.2015 in conformity with
the order of the TPO and determined the total income of the assessee company
at Rs. 80,85,90,910/- as against the returned income of Rs. 12,35,25,748/-.
The assessee company filed objections dated 26.03.2015 against the said draft
order before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP). The DRP vide order dated
30.09.2015 rejected the objections of the assessee company and upheld the
adjustment proposed in relation to AMP expenditure. Pursuant to the directions
of the DRP, the TPO passed order giving effect to the directions of DRP on
04.11.2015 without excluding direct selling / distribution expenditure from
the ambit of AMP. Thus, the TPO enhanced transfer pricing adjustment from Rs.
68,50,65,162/- to Rs. 75,02,87,734/-. The final assessment order was passed by
the Assessing Officer on 13.11.2015, determining income as under:
                 Particulars                            Amount (INR)
        Returned income under the normal provisions     12,35,25,748
        of the Act
        Add: TP Adjustment pursuant to directions of    75,02,87,734
        DRP
Aggrieved by the assessment order, the assessee company preferred an appeal
before the Tribunal. The Tribunal, vide order dated 15.07.2016 set aside the
assessment order/transfer pricing order and remanded the issue back to the
AO/TPO for afresh determination of existence of an international transaction
of AMP expenditure and determination of ALP of the international transaction
in case the same exists. Further, the Tribunal directed to exclude direct
selling / marketing expenses from the ambit of AMP expenditure. Being
aggrieved, both  5 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 the assessee company as well as
Revenue authorities have filed appeals before the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana
High Court which are duly admitted. Pursuant to directions of the Tribunal,
the TPO issued a notice dated 03.10.2016 thereby seeking reply to detailed
questionnaire in relation to AMP expenditure of the assessee company. The
assessee company, vide, submissions dated 08.11.2016, filed a detailed reply
highlighting following points:  AMP expenditure incurred by the assessee
company is solely for its own benefit and any benefit arising/accruing to AEs
on its account is purely co-incidental in nature;
 The AEs have no role/ decision-making powers in respect of the assessee
company;
 Marketing function of the assessee company is independent, and the AEs does
not exercise any control over the same;
 There is no written/oral arrangement between the assessee and its AEs, under
which it is required to incur a minimum marketing expenditure.
The TPO, after considering the said submissions and following the Tribunal
directions, passed an order dated 10.11.2016, wherein, TPO deleted the TP
adjustment stating the following:
> Order Giving Effect to the Directions of the Hon'ble ITAT, New Delhi The
> Hon'ble ITAT, New Delhi vide his order dated 15.07.2016 has set aside the
> case and the matter is restored to the file of TPO/AO for fresh
> determination of question as to whether there exists an international
> transaction of AMP expenses. The selling expenses directly incurred in
> connection with sales not leading to brand promotion, should not be brought
> within the ambit of AMP.
> Therefore, in view of the direction of the Hon'ble the ITAT, the earlier
> adjustment of Rs. 75,02,87,734/- is being revised to Nil.
Thereafter, the TPO issued a notice dated 15.03.2017, stating that the order
of  6 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 the TPO has encountered certain discrepancies and
accordingly, the assessee company was requested to show-cause why the earlier
order dated 10.11.2016, be not amended as per the TP order for Assessment Year
2010-11. A response was filed by the assessee company in this regard vide
submissions dated 30.03.2017 and it was elaborately submitted that the said
order could not be rectified under Section 154 of the Act. Notwithstanding it
was also submitted that even if an intensity adjustment is carried out, then
also, the ALP of the international transaction of the assessee company are at
arm's length. The TPO passed another order dated 16.05.2017 under Section
92CA(3) read with Section 254 of the Act. The TPO vide above stated subsequent
order dated 16.05.2017 re-determined the adjustment relating to AMP
expenditure on substantive as well as protective basis, as under:
Basis Method for benchmarking Adjustment u/s 92CA read with Section 254 of the
Act (in INR) Substantive AMP intensity adjustment 4,30,85,529 (which falls
(without granting benefit of +/- within 5% range) 5% as per proviso of Section
92C(2) of the Act) Protective BLT (already discarded by 30,99,61,631Court
Hon'ble Delhi High) Pursuant to the above, the Assessing Officer passed the
final order dated July 10, 2017 under Section 143(3) read with Section 144C
and Section 254 of the Act.
4\. Being aggrieved by the assessment order, the assessee company has filed
this appeal before us.
5\. The Ld. AR submitted that Ground No. 3 is a legal ground that the latter
order dated May 6, 2017 passed by the Transfer Pricing Officer ("TPO") is non-
7 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017
est and invalid. The TPO has rectified its earlier order dated November 10,
2016, which was passed to give effect to the directions of the Tribunal vide
order dated July 15, 2016, arising out of ITA No. 6314/ Del/ 2015, without
specifying the mistake apparent from record. The Ld. AR submitted that the
Tribunal vide order dated July 15, 2016 had restored the matter regarding
alleged excessive incurrence of AMP expenditure is whether an international
transaction and benchmarking the same if it is at first place held it to be an
international transaction, for de-novo adjudication / benchmarking in light of
the recent jurisprudence of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and various decisions
of the Hon'ble Benches of the Tribunal. In line with the same the TPO vide
order dated November 10, 2016 deleted the adjustment on account of
Advertisement, Marketing and Promotion Expenditure ("AMP") as alleged
international transaction. Before passing of the appeal effect order dated
November 10, 2016, the TPO had issued a show cause notice dated September 26,
2016 (received on October 10, 2016); calling for the details as to why AMP
expenditure should not be treated as an international transaction and the
economic analysis for benchmarking the said alleged international transaction.
The assessee vide submissions dated November 8, 2016 filed detailed objections
in respect to the above-mentioned questionnaire. The TPO after taking into
consideration, the submissions filed and also the earlier submissions /
documents on record, passed an appeal effect order dated November 10, 2016
determining the ALP of the alleged incurrence of excessive AMP expenditure as
an international transaction Nil. In other words, no adjustment was proposed
on account of the said alleged international transaction. Thereafter, the TPO
issued a show-cause notice dated March 15, 2016\. In the said notice, the TPO
stated that there are certain discrepancies in the order dated November 10,
2016 and therefore, why the said order should not be rectified in terms of the
transfer pricing order passed for AY 2010-11. Meaning thereby, the TPO
intended to make transfer pricing adjustment on account of alleged excessive
AMP expenditure as an international transaction on substantive basis using
intensity method and bright line method on  8 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 protective
basis, as was done in AY 2010-11 in the second round of proceedings (i.e.,
post remand by the Tribunal). The Ld. AR pointed out that nowhere in the
above-mentioned rectification notice, proposing rectification of the earlier
order the TPO has given reasons as to what were the mistakes apparent from
record which form the basis for rectifying that earlier order; besides
summarily stated that there are certain discrepancies. At the outset, it may
be pointed out that from the perusal of the impugned rectification notice, it
is apparent that the TPO has used the term "certain discrepancies", which
clearly shows that even if there were any mistakes, termed as "discrepancies"
the same were debatable and were beyond the purview of section 154 of the Act.
As per section 154 of the Act, only mistakes apparent from records can be
rectified and not debatable mistakes or discrepancies. The Ld. AR submitted
that law is no longer res integra on rectification of mistakes apparent from
record and its only the mistakes which are non-debatable can be rectified
under section 154 of the Act. The Appellant in response to the said
rectification show-cause notice, filed submissions dated March 30, 2017. The
Ld. AR pointed out that the TPO does not have any jurisdiction to rectify the
order dated November 10, 2016. The Ld. AR further pointed out that on the
facts and circumstances of the case and in law there was no mistake apparent
from record and as to why the order of the AY 2010-11 (passed in second round)
should not be followed. The assessee, in summary stated before the TPO that
(i) AY 2010-11, being the first year of adjustment on account of AMP
expenditure, the Tribunal based on the jurisprudence available at that point
of time, i.e., LG Electronics, Special Bench LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd.
vs. ACIT (2013) 152 TTJ (Del) 273 (SB), which had upheld incurrence of alleged
excessive AMP expenditure as an international transaction and it was only for
the purposes of computing the transfer pricing of the alleged international
transaction that the matter was remanded back to the AO / TPO. In the instant
AY, however, the legal challenge is to whether alleged excessive incurrence of
AMP Expenditure is an international transaction and the computation of
transfer pricing of alleged international transaction was  9 ITA No.
5146/Del/2017 remanded back to the file of the AO / TPO. In other words, in AY
2010-11, it was limited remand to benchmark, whereas in AY 2011-12, the whole
issue has been remanded back. The TPO before passing of the subsequent order
dated May 16, 2017 making transfer pricing adjustment on account of alleged
excessive AMP expenditure as an international transaction, neither
independently dispose the objections filed by the assessee to the above-
mentioned rectification show-cause notice, nor were they considered while
passing the later transfer pricing order and also nowhere, in the later TP
order it has been mentioned that the earlier order stands rectified for the
reasons as may have been considered / culled out by the TPO. In other words,
TPO being aware of the position that debatable claims/ additions/
disallowances do not come within the purview of section 154 of the Act, chose
to remain silent and passed a non-speaking TP order dated May 16, 2017. The
Ld. AR submitted that when the earlier order has not been rectified or
reversed in the subsequent TP order passed by the TPO, two transfer pricing
orders for the same assessment year cannot co-exist. The same is undisputed
from the subsequent order dated May 16, 2017, passed by the TPO that not only
the TPO has ignored the submissions of the assessee filed against
rectification notice issued section 154, but was also not diligent enough to
mention the earlier TP order dated November 10, 2016 stands modified/
rectified. Nowhere in the of the order, an averment/ reference has been made
to the earlier TP order, making it apparent that the lower authorities were
well aware that rectification of the earlier TP order would not stand the test
of assumption of jurisdiction under section 154 of the Act, as the mistake (if
any, though there was none on the facts and circumstances of the instant case)
sought to be rectified was debatable chose to conveniently ignore the earlier
TP order. In view of the above, the Ld. AR submitted that; (a) the subsequent
TP order dated May 16, 2017 is bad in law and void ab-initio and (b) in any
case as per the admittance of the lower authority vide order dated November
10, 2016, which still exists as on date, no transfer pricing adjustment on
account of alleged incurrence of excessive AMP expenditure as international
transaction is  10 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 warranted.
6\. On merit, as regards to Ground No. 4 relating to whether AMP is an
international transaction, the Ld. AR submitted that the AO / TPO have gravely
erred in interpreting that the AMP expenditure incurred by Nikon India towards
third parties in India, accounts for brand building activities in India and
that Nikon India should be remunerated for carrying out such brand building
activities for its AEs. The assessee company strongly contests that the
marketing activities performed by Nikon were for the need and benefit of Nikon
India and not for the purpose of benefit/ on behalf of its AEs. Nikon India
has incurred expenditure on AMP to cater to local market needs. Such AMP was
neither incurred at the instance of overseas AE nor was there any mutual
agreement or understanding or arrangement as to the allocation or contribution
by the AE towards reimbursement of expenses incurred by the domestic company
for its business purposes. Further, onus to prove the existence of a mutual
agreement between the AEs for incurring AMP expenditure has been placed on the
revenue by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd vs. CIT [2016] 381 ITR 117 (Delhi). The TPO
has not brought, on record, any iota of evidence to substantiate that there
has been an understanding between the domestic company and its AE to:
\- incur AMP expenditure on behalf of AE and its reimbursement thereof;
\- develop (if any created) / transfer of marketing intangibles, in the course
of incurrence of such expenditure; and
\- make payment for rendering marketing development services or other allied
activities.
AMP expenditure can, at best, be termed as unilateral endeavour by the
domestic company for achieving higher sales / retaining market share and any
alleged benefit to AE would be merely incidental which cannot at all be
brought under the umbrella of 'international transaction' as referred to in
section 92B of the Act. The TPO in its order could not prove any such separate
arrangement/ agreement existed, hence the domestic transactions does not fall
11 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 under the ambit of Section 92B(2) of the Act. The TPO
has simply placed reliance on the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case
of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India P. Ltd. vs. CIT: [2015] 374 ITR
118 (Delhi) and stated that the expenditure incurred by the assessee company
is excessive, thus, is an international transaction. There is no
understanding, what so ever in the agreement to depict that Nikon India is
incurring excessive expenditure owing to any arrangement between Nikon India
and its AE with the intention to promote the brand of foreign AE in India. The
expenses incurred by the assessee company are required in the routine course
of business to increase the sale of its products within India. It is clear
that assessee company's marketing efforts only cater for promoting the
products that it deals in, solely with an intention to boost its sales in
India. The marketing decisions taken by Nikon India are independent and not
controlled or driven by the AEs. The Ld. AR, in this regard, draws attention
of the Bench to the following judgments of the Hon'ble High Court and Tribunal
wherein, it was held that AMP is not an International transaction under the
purview of Section 92 the Act:  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd vs CIT(A)[2016] 381

of the above decisions, it is clear that since, TPO / AO has not brought any
evidence on record to show that there exists an arrangement, the AMP
expenditure of the assessee company cannot be considered as an international
transaction. There is no shred of evidence that justifies the TPO's argument
that Nikon India is incurring AMP expenses at the behest of its AE on the
basis of some mutual arrangement. In view of the above, the said AMP expenses
incurred by the assessee company cannot be held to be an international
transaction. The Ld. AR submitted that without considering the submissions of
the assessee company and without pointing out what mistakes (which are
apparent from records) have crept-in the said order, the TPO rectified the
earlier order which is against. The Ld. AR further pointed out that the said
order was passed solely on the basis of change in opinion and not based on any
mistake apparent. Further, it was passed without the mention of the previous
order dated 10.11.2016.
7\. The Ld. DR submitted that the order passed under Section 154 of the Act is
valid and there was a mistake apparent in respect of order giving effect to
the directions of the Tribunal in order dated 10.11.2016 passed by the TPO.
The Ld. DR further submitted that the assessee has incurred huge AMP
expenditure to develop marketing intangible to promote the trademark/Brand
name owned by its AE. The AE has received benefit in the form of enhanced
brand value in India and increased sales of their products. The Ld. DR relied
upon the order of the TPO and submitted that the AMP expenditure constitutes
an "International Transaction" within the meaning of Section 92B(1) of the
Act. The Ld. DR pointed out the amendments made by Finance Act, 2012 to
Section 92B of the Act which added an explanation, wherein it was stated that
the international transaction shall include the purchase, sale, transfer,
lease or use of intangible property, including the transfer of ownership or
the provision  13 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 of use of licenses, franchises,
customer list, marketing channel, brand, commercial secret, know-how,
industrial property right, exterior design or practical and new design or any
other business or commercial rights of similar nature. The explanation further
described intangible property as marketing related intangible assets, such as,
trademarks, trade names, brand names, logos. Thus, the legislative intention
has been clarified by these amendments. The transfer pricing regulations also
require that it is not only the form but the overall arrangement/substance of
the transactions that must be kept in mind. Thus, the TPO righty held that AMP
expenditure are international transaction within the meaning of Section 92B(1)
of the Act. The Ld. DR relied upon the decision of the Tribunal in case of M/s
Olympus Medical Systems India Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT being ITA No. 7414/Del/2018
order dated 27.03.2019.
8\. We have heard both the parties and perused all the relevant material
available on record. The Tribunal vide order dated 15.07.2016 held as under:
> "19. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant material
> on record. The ld. AR tried to harp on certain agreements and other
> documents to buttress his point that there was no international transaction
> on account of AMP expenses in terms of the judgment in the case of Whirlpool
> (supra). On perusal of the order of the TPO, it emerges that there is no
> discussion about any of these documents. Since the TPO held AMP expenses to
> be an international transaction, he did not have any occasion to consider
> these documents in the light of the judicial view now available for
> consideration. Respectfully following the Tribunal orders of co-ordinate
> benches, placed on record by the ld. DR, we are of the considered opinion
> that it would be in the fitness of things if the impugned order is set aside
> and the matter is restored to the file of TPO/AO for a fresh determination
> of the question as to whether there exists an international transaction of
> AMP expenses. If the existence of such an international transaction is not
> proved, the matter will end there and then, calling for no transfer pricing
> addition. If, on the other hand, the international transaction is found to
> be existing, then  14 ITA No. 5146/Del/2017 the TPO will determine the ALP
> of such an international transaction in the light of the relevant judgments
> of the Hon'ble High Court, after allowing a reasonable opportunity of being
> heard to the assessee. In doing so, the selling expenses directly incurred
> in connection with sales not leading to brand promotion, should not be
> brought within the ambit of AMP expenses. This view taken by the Special
> Bench of the Tribunal in the case of LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT
> (2013) 152 TTJ (Del) 273 (SB) has been upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High
> Court in the case of Sony Ericson Mobile Communications (India) Pvt. Ltd.
> vs. CIT (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del.) The contention of the ld. DR that SLP has
> been admitted against the exclusion of selling expenses from the ambit of
> AMP expenses in the case of Amadus India Ltd., does not alter the legal
> position prevailing as on today."
As per the directions of the Tribunal, the TPO vide order dated 10.11.2016
passed the following order:
"Order Giving Effect to the Directions of the Hon'ble ITAT, New Delhi The
Hon'ble ITAT, New Delhi vide his order dated 15.07.2016 has set aside the case
and the matter is restored to the file of TPO/AO for fresh determination of
question as to whether there exists an international transaction of AMP
expenses. The selling expenses directly incurred in connection with sales not
leading to brand promotion, should not be brought within the ambit of AMP.
Therefore, in view of the direction of the Hon'ble the ITAT, the earlier
adjustment of Rs. 75,02,87,734/- is being revised to Nil."
But on 15/3/2017, the TPO issued Show Cause Notice relating to rectification
of order dated 10/11/2016 thereby asking why earlier order passed for
Assessment Year 2011-2 be not amended as per order passed for Assessment Year
2010-11. It is pertinent to note that while remanding back the question as to
whether there exists an international transaction of AMP expenses, the  15 ITA
No. 5146/Del/2017 Tribunal in Assessment Year 2011-12 categorically held that
if the existence of such an international transaction is not proved, the mater
will end there and then, calling for no transfer pricing addition. Firstly, we
must looked into the relevant Section for rectification of order passed by the
Assessing Officer/TPO. Section 154(1A) of the Income Tax Act, categorically
reads as under:-
> "Section 154 .....................
> (1A) Where any matter has been considered and decided in any proceeding by
> way of appeal or revision relating to an order referred to in sub- section
> (1), the authority passing such order may, notwithstanding anything
> contained in any law for the time being in force, amend the order under that
> sub- section in relation to any matter other than the matter which has been
> so considered and decided.
> ..........................."
Thus, Section 154(1A) lays down that rectification can be done for any matter
other than the matter considered and decided in appeal/revision. Thus, whene
any matter had been considered and decided in any proceeding by way of appeal
or revision, rectification of such matter cannot be done by TPO/Assessing
Officer under Section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The said position is
clear in terms of Section 154(1A) of the Act wherein it has been laid that
where any matter has been considered and decided in any proceedings by way of
appeal or revision relating to an order referred to in sub section (1), the
authority passing such order, may notwithstanding anything contained in any
law for the time being in force, amend the order under that sub section in
relation to any matter other than the matter which has been so considered and
decided. The order of the Appellate Tribunal having become final and after the
final decision of the Appellate Tribunal, the Revenue could not initiate fresh
assessment proceedings, as the order of the Tribunal was binding on the
Revenue. It was noted that various High Court had expressed a similar view.
Thus, the questions which are expressly raised before or decided by the
appellate or revisional authority cannot be re-agitated and no rectification
proceedings will be maintainable in respect thereof, under section  16 ITA No.
5146/Del/2017 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, before the TPO/Assessing
Officer in the garb of amending his/her own order. Thus, the assumption of
jurisdiction by the TPO/AO u/s 154 is bad in law and void ab intio. Therefore,
the assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer on 10.07.2017 is also bad
in law and void ab initio, thus, the Assessment order is set-aside. Hence,
Ground No. 3 is allowed. Since the legal ground raised in Ground No. 3 itself
goes to the root of the legality of assessment order, there is no need to
entertain the grounds raised in consonance with the merit of the case. Hence,
appeal of the assessee is allowed.
9\. In result, appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Order pronounced in open court on this 14th Day of December, 2020.
