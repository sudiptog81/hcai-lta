validity of penalty proceedings initiated u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, in light
of show cause notice issued by the A.O u/s 274 r.w.s 271 of the Act, but fact
remains that the penalty levied by the A.O u/s 271(1)(c) has been deleted for
all assessment years. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Cross
Objections filed by the assessee for all assessment years becomes infructuous
and hence, the same were dismissed as not maintainable.
19\. In the result, the appeals filed by the Revenue and Cross Objections
filed by the assessee are dismissed.

this consolidated order.
2\. The revenue, has more or less raised common grounds of appeal for all
assessment years. Therefore, for the sake of brevity, grounds of appeal filed
for A.Y 2008-09 in ITA No.6268/Mum/2018 are reproduced as under:

3\. The assessee, has more or less raised common grounds of cross objection
for all assessment years. Therefore, for the sake of brevity grounds of cross
objections filed for the A.Y 2008-09 in cross objection No. 244/Mum/2019 are
reproduced as under:
> "1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstance of the case and in law,

4\. The brief facts of the case extracted from ITA No. 6268/Mum/2018 for the
A.Y 2008-09 are that, the assessee is a public limited company, engaged in the
business of oil exploration, manufacturing and trading of petro chemicals,
polyester, fiber intermediate textiles, generation and distribution of power
and operation of jetties ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to
245/Mum/2019  -5- and related infrastructure and investment activities. The
assessee has filed its return of income for the A.Y 2008-09 on 30.09.2008
declaring total income at Rs. 7846,22,57,374/- under normal provisions of the
Income Tax Act, 1961, and Rs. 22944,76,85,176/- under the provisions of Sec.
115JB of the Act. The assessment has been completed u/s 143(3) of the Act, on
31.08.2010 determining the total income at Rs. 9033,85,80,777/- under normal
provisions of the Act, and Rs. 23069,36,91,462/- under the provisions of Sec.
115JB of the Act, by making various additions, including additions towards
disallowance of depreciation on steel purchases, disallowance out of
professional fees paid to various parties and additions towards transfer
pricing adjustment u/s 92C of the Act, towards interest on loan to
subsidiaries.
5\. Thereafter, the A.O has initiated penalty proceedings u/s 271(1)(c) of the
Act, with reference to additions / disallowance made in the assessment order,
and called upon the assessee to explain as to why penalty shall not be levied
for concealment of particulars of income and for furnishing inaccurate
particulars of income. In response, the assessee vide letter dated 14.03.2014
has filed a ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019  -6-
detailed written submissions and explained that concealment of penalty
provided u/s 271(1)(c) is not attracted in respect of additions made towards
disallowance of depreciation on steel purchase, additions towards disallowance
out of professional charges paid to various parities and additions towards
transfer pricing adjustment u/s 92C of the Act, in respect of interest on loan
to subsidiaries. The Ld. A.O did not find merit in the submissions of the
assessee and by following various judicial precedents, including the decision
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Dharmendra Textile
Pvt Ltd. and others (306 ITR 277) has held that the assessee company has filed
inaccurate particulars of its income and concealed the particulars of its
income within the meaning the Sec. 271(1)(c) read with explanation (1) thereto
of the Act, in respect of additions made towards disallowance of depreciation
on steel purchase, disallowance out of professional fees paid to various
parties and additions towards transfer pricing adjustment on account of
interest on loans to subsidiaries. Therefore, he opined that it is a pit case
for levy of penalty u/s 271(1)(c) read with explanation (1) of the Act thereto
and accordingly levied penalty of Rs. 5,48,58,500/- which is ITA Nos. 6267 to
6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019  -7- equal to 100% of tax sought
to be evaded for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income.
6\. Aggrieved by the penalty order, the assessee preferred an appeal before
the CIT(A). Before the CIT(A), the assessee has challenged levy of penalty u/s
271(1)(c) of the Act, on the ground that the A.O has levied penalty u/s
271(1)(c) read with explanation (1) thereto which is applicable for
concealment of particulars of income, whereas, while concluding penalty
proceedings, he had levied penalty for furnishing inaccurate particulars of
income. On merits, the assessee has submitted that it has neither concealed
particulars of income nor furnished inaccurate particulars of income, but the
additions made during assessment proceedings in respect of disallowance of
depreciation on steel purchases was only on account of different view taken on
same set of facts which could be at best be termed as difference of opinion
and certainly not furnishing of inaccurate particulars of such income. The
assessee, further, submitted that in respect of other additions made by the
A.O towards disallowance of professional fees, the Ld. CIT(A) has set said the
issue to the file of the A.O to decide the matter afresh after hearing the
assessee, ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019  -8-
therefore, once the issue has been set aside, the penalty thereto cannot be
levied for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. In so far as,
additions towards transfer pricing adjustment u/s 92C of the Act, towards
interest on loan to subsidiaries, the assessee submitted that the issue is
debatable, because there are divergent views where, some courts and tribunals
have held in favoure of the assessee that said transactions are not an
international transactions, consequently transfer pricing adjustment cannot be
made on loans to subsidiaries, whereas, in some cases the issue has been
decided in favoure of the revenue and held that transaction requires transfer
pricing adjustment in respect of loans to subsidiaries. Therefore, from the
above it is very clear that, the matter is debatable and always two views are
possible, therefore, on such issues penalty cannot be levied u/s 271(1)(c) of
the Act, when the assessee has declared necessary facts for computation of
income in the return filed for the relevant assessment years.
7\. Ld. CIT(A) after considering the submissions of the assessee and also
taken note of the fact that the ITAT has deleted penalty levied on
disallowance of depreciation on ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243
to 245/Mum/2019  -9- steel purchase for A.Y 2003-04 to 2006-07 in ITA No. 7219
to 7221/Mum/2011, vide order dated 11.12.2013, has deleted penalty levied on
additions towards depreciation on steel purchases. In so far as, additions
towards disallowance of professional fees, the Ld. CIT(A) has deleted penalty
on the ground that once the issue has been restored back to the file of the
A.O for deciding the issue afresh, the penalty on such additions cannot be
survived in view of the decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
Ranchhodbhai Haribhai Jadav Vs ACIT (238 ITR 949), accordingly deleted penalty
levied by the A.O. As regards, penalty levied on transfer pricing adjustment
in respect of interest on loans to subsidiaries, the Ld. CIT(A) by following
various judicial precedents including the decision of ITAT Delhi in the case
of HCL Perot Systems Ltd., Vs. ACIT (supra) held that once the issue is
debatable, the assessee contention cannot be shut down that it has disclosed
necessary facts in respect of loans in the return of income, simply because in
assessment transfer pricing adjustment made by the A.O has been upheld by the
Tribunal. He, further, noted that, finding in assessment proceedings cannot be
the sole basis to justify imposition of penalty and also observed that in the
instant case where assessee acts ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243
to 245/Mum/2019
\- 10 -
in a bonafide manner / in good faith and exercise do diligence, no penalty can
be levied even transfer pricing adjustment has been sustained by the appellate
authorities. Accordingly, deleted penalty levied by the A.O. Aggrieved by the
CIT(A) order, the Revenue is in appeal before us.
8\. The Ld. DR submitted that, the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in deleting the
penalty levied u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, in respect of disallowance of
depreciation on steel purchases, even though the A.O has brought out clear
facts to the effect that steel purchase has been capitalized into fixed asset
with a non-genuine transactions and the said additions has been finally
confirmed by the Tribunal. The Ld. DR further submitted that, the Ld. CIT(A)
has erred in deleting penalty in respect of disallowance of professional fees
paid to Shri S.K. Gupta Group of Companies, even though the documentary
evidence regarding rendering of services seized during the search operation
manifested that the professional fees paid by the assessee was bogus, as no
relevant services were rendered by such companies. He further submitted that,
as regards additions towards transfer pricing adjustments, the Ld. CIT(A) has
failed to appreciate the facts in right perspective of provisions of Sec.
ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 11 -
92C of the Act, even though the assessee has furnished inaccurate particulars
of income and concealed the particulars of income and also did not submit any
new facts / materials to substantiate its claim for non levy of penalty.
Therefore, he submitted that the Ld. CIT(A) has deleted penalty without
considering relevant facts and hence the penalty levied by the A.O should be
upheld.
9\. The Ld. AR for the assessee, on the other hand, strongly supporting the
order of the Ld. CIT(A), submitted that, in so far as, penalty levied on
additions towards depreciation on steel purchases, the issue has been covered
in favoure of the assessee by the decision of the ITAT in assessee's own case
for A.Y 2003-04 to 2006-07 in ITA Nos. 7219 to 7221/Mum/2011, where under
identical set of facts the penalty levied has been deleted. In so far as,
additions towards disallowance of professional fees paid to Shri S.K Gupta
Group of Companies, the ITAT has deleted quantum disallowances made by the A.O
in ITA No. 4361/Mum/2012, vide order dated 12.04.2017 and once additions has
been deleted, penalty levied on said addition cannot survive in the eyes of
law. As regards penalty levied towards transfer pricing adjustment on loans to
ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 12 -
subsidiaries, the Ld. AR of the assessee submitted that the issue involved is
a highly debatable which is evident from the fact that the Hon'ble Bombay High
Court vide its order dated 02.11.2019 in the case of Piramal Glass Ltd., Vs.
DCIT in income tax appeal No. 1255 of 2017 has admitted the question of law on
whether transfer pricing adjustment is required to be made on loans given to
the AE to increase and expand the business of the assessee. He, further,
submitted that admission of this appeal indicates that the question is an
arguable point in law on which two views are possible and therefore, it is not
a case of penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act. In this regard, he relied upon the
decision of Delhi Tribunal in the case of HCL Perot Systems Ltd., Vs. ACIT in
ITA No. 2200/Del/2011. He, further submitted that the Hon'ble Bombay High
Court in the case of PCIT Vs. Dhariwal Industries Ltd., in income tax appeal
No. 1133 of 2016 held that, when question of law is admitted there is no
question of levying penalty. In this case, on perusal of details, it is noted
that there are divergent views in respect of transfer pricing adjustment on
loans to subsidiaries, where in some cases the issue has been decided in
favoure of the assessee and in some cases the issue has been decided in
favoure of the revenue. But, ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to
245/Mum/2019
\- 13 -
the fact remains that the substantial question of law has been admitted by
Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court and hence, from the above it is very clear
that the matter is highly debatable and always two views are possible. Once
the matter is debatable and two views are possible, then on such issues
penalty provided u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act for concealment of income or
furnishing inaccurate particulars of income cannot be levied. In this regard,
he has filed a detailed written submissions which has been reproduced as
under:
"7. Our submissions, in the alternative and without prejudice to each other,
on why the penalty deleted by CIT(A) should not be reinstated are as under:
a) It is respectf ully sub mitted th at the Hon'ble Bomb ay High Court v ide
its latest order dated 8th November 2019 in the case of Piramal Glass Limited
vs The Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (INCOME TAX APPEAL NO. 1255 OF 2017)
has admitted the question of law on whether transfer pric in g ad jus tme n t
is req u ir ed to be mad e on lo an s g iv en to the AE to increase and expand
the business of the Assessee. It is submitted that as narrated in our case,
the Assessee had also lent money to its AE on account of business expediency.
It is further submitted that admission of this appeal indicates that the
question is an arguable point in law on which two views are possible and
therefore it is not a case of penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act. On similar
lines, the Delhi Tribunal in the case of Perot Systems TSI (Ind ia) Pvt L td
v/s A C IT [ IT A No. 2200 an d ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243
to 245/Mum/2019
\- 14 -
2 2 0 1 / D e 1 / 2 0 1 1 ] has deleted the penalty and held that since the TP
adjustment on the issue of interest free loan is admitted as substantial
question of law no penalty can be levied. That is further fortified by the
jurisdictional High Court in the case of The Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax
vs. Dhariwal I n d u s t r i e s L td . [ I N C O M E T A X A P P E A L N O .
1 1 3 3 / 1 1 3 6 / 1 1 2 9 O F 2016] that when question of law is admitted,
there is no question of levying penalty.
c) It is submitted that the return of income u/s 139(1) for A.Y. 2008- 09 was
filed on 30-09-2008. The issue whether TP adjustment can be made in respect of
interest free loan to a subsidiary is a subject matter which falls into
debatable issue. This is evident from the fact that the ITAT had to constitute
a Special Bench of 3 members to adjudicate the said issue. The Special Bench,
after deliberating in depth various arguments, in the case of Instrumentarium
Corporation Ltd. v. ADIT reported in [2016] 71 taxmann.com 193 (Kolkata -
Trib.) (SB) on 15th July 2016 held that _ Such a transaction requires TP
adjustment. The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Tooltech Global
Engineering (P) Ltd. vs. ACIT reported in (2018) 254 TAXMAN 0241 (Bombay) on
5th March 2018 has also held that such a transaction requires TP adjustment.
b) It is settled position of law as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Brij
Mohan v. CIT reported in 120 ITR 1 and CIT v. Onkar Saran & Sons reported in
195 ITR I that law on the date of filing the return should be seen for
adjudicating whether penalty should be levied. It is, therefore, respectf ully
sub mitted th at at the poin t of f iling of return of inco me, the issue was
a debatable one and has achieved finality much later. Further the TP
provisions were first introduced in the statute in the current format in FY
01-02 and the law was in an incipient stage at the point of filing return of
income for FY 06-07 when the issues first arose. In fact the first assessment
cycle under the TP provisions for AY 2002-03 was completed by 31St ITA Nos.
6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 15 -
March 2005 and hence by the time of f iling the return of income f or AY
2008-09, there was not much judicial clarity available. Further no guidelines
were issued by the CBDT on this issue. It is therefore submitted that as the
issue is a debatable issue, penalty u/s 271(1)(c) should not be levied.
d) The assessee had advanced interest free loan to RIME DMCC for expanding
itself in the international market through acquisition of majority stake in
GAPCO Group which was engaged in marketing of petroleum products in Af r ic an
c o un tr ie s . ( R ef er p g s 23 0 -2 31 of th e p ap e r b o ok . ) T he s
aid e x p l an a t io n h a s n o t b e e n d is p u te d b y th e R e v e n u
e a u th o r i t i e s . T h is transaction amounts to capital financing and
the said capital financing was broug h t with in the def in itio n of " in
tern atio n al tr an s ac tio n" b y inser ting Explanation to section 92B by
the Finance Act, 2012 w.r.e.f. 01-04-2002. It is submitted that no penalty
should be levied on account of retrospective amendment wh ich amendment was
not available at the time of f iling the return and the assessment order.
Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
CIT v. Hindustan Electro Graphites Ltd., reported in 243 ITR
48\.
d) It is further submitted that even post retrospective amendment, the Hon'ble
Tribunal in the case of Siro Clinpharm Pvt. Ltd., ITA 2618/M12014 has held
that the retrospective amend ment to the def inition of "international
transaction" by the Finance Act, 2012 would be applicable only post 2012 and
no t prior there to. T his also sho ws that even af ter the retrospective
amendment the issue is highly debatable.
e) It is submitted that the Petitioner had Dusiiic5.5 rciationchip with its
AE, RIME DMCC since the Petitioner had sold high-speed diesel, aviation
turbine fuel and motor spirit as evident from pgs 203, 204, 214, 216 and 218.
It is submitted that if an interest free loan is given to its ITA Nos. 6267 to
6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 16 -
subsidiary with whom the assessee has business relationship then the
parameters relevant f or mak ing ad jus tmen t on account of pure lending
would not be appl ic able because even in case of business relationship with
non-related parties, a businessman would give interest free loan looking at
his business interests. T heref ore, no TP adjustment could be made as held by
the Ah madabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Micro Inks Ltd. V. ACIT
reported in 157 TTJ 289 and the discussion is at paras 10 to 17 where on an
identical situation no adjustment was made on account of interest free loan
because of business transactions. Similar view is also taken in the following
decisions • Ucal Fuel Systems Ltd vs The Asst. Commissioner of Income-tax [
I.T .A.No.688/Mds/2014, 723, 724 &725/Mds/2015] • The Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co.

g) It is submitted that the AO has wrongly levied penalty under Explanation 1
to section 271(1)(c) f or T P adjustment. In f act Explan ation 7 to section
271(1)(c) provides f or penalty on T P adjustment. Both the Explanations
operate in two different f ields and separate parameters are required to be
tested for levying penalty under these 2 Explanations. Explanation 7 is a s p
e c ial p r o v is io n d e al in g wi th pe n al ty o n tr an sf e r p r ic i
n g ad ju s t me n t whereas Explanation 1 is a general provision dealing with
penalty on all types of additions/disallowances. Since Explanation 7 has been
introduced for covering special circumstances, the general provision of
Explanation 1 cannot be made applicable in case ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018
& CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 17 -
of TP adjustments. Special provisions will prevail over general provisions.
Therefore, the penalty on this account is bad in law. It is sub mitte d th at
on a true an d p roper cons truc tion an d h ar mon io us r e ad in g of s ec
tio n 2 7 1(1 )( c) an d s e c tio n 9 2 C , th e p e n al ty u / s se c tio n
271(1)(c) can be levied only if the exercise of transfer pricing adjustment is
done by the AO and not when the said exercise is done by the TPO u/s 92CA, and
the AO under the scheme of the Act has merely adopted what is stated by the T
PO in his order. This is also f ortif ied by Explanation 7 to section
271(1)(c) where the reference is to section 92C(4) which provides for
adjustment to be made by the AO whereas the TPO makes adjustment u/s 92CA. It
is submitted that it is the TPO who has done the exercise of TP adjustment,
who can f orm a satisf action on the ingredients of penalty. In the instant
case, the exercise of TP adjustment is made by the TPO, and on a re ad ing of
the T PO's ord er the ingr ed ien ts of s atisf ac tion c an n o t be a s c e
r t a i n e d . H o we v e r t h e A O , wh o h a s n o t d o n e t h e e x e
r c i s e o f T P adjustment, has initiated penalty. It is, therefore,
submitted that in such a scenario penalty cannot be levied by the AO when the
adjustment is made by the TPO and no satisf action is recorded by the TPO. The
AG will have power to levy penalty, if he himself does the exercise of TP
adjustment u/s 92G. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Gujarat
High Court in the case of Pankajbhai Shah v. ACIT reported in 110 taxmann.com
51 where the reassessment notice was issued by an off icer who did not record
the reasons but the reasons were recorded by another officer, and the Hon 1
ble Gujarat High Court quashed the reassessment proceedings on the ground that
the person recording the reasons for escapement of income should be the same
person who can issue ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to
245/Mum/2019
\- 18 -
reassessment notice. Further the legislature itself has provided for levy of
penalty by the TPO under section 271G when the TP reference to the TPO is made
by the AO and the Assessee fails to furnish information/documentation under
section 92D(3).
i) It is further submitted that in the assessment order at pg 51 of the paper
book no satisfaction can be said to have been recorded merely because the off
icer has written that penalty is to be initiated. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court
in the case of Ms. Madhushree Gupta v. UQI reported in 317 ITR 107 at para 19
has held that even after insertion of section 271(1B) of the Ac t, the AG has
to record prima f acie s atisf action f or in itiating penal ty. However on
reading of the assessment order it is seen that no such prima facie
satisfaction is recorded and therefore even on this account the penalty order
is bad in law.
F u r th e r th e d e c is io n in th e c as e o f Zo o m r e l ie d u pon b y
th e A O is n o t applicable to the facts of the present appeal. The Bombay
High Court in the case of CIT v. Dalmia Dyechem Industries Ltd. reported in
377 ITR 133 has also negatived the contention of the Revenue that merely
because less n u mb er of c ases are s ele c ted f or scru tin y an d h ad it
no t be en f or scrutiny assessment the addition would have gone unnoticed. It
is further submitted that the case of the Petitioner is assessed u/s 143(3)
every year on its being an assessee falling under LTU. The case laws relied by
the AG in the penalty order are distinguishable on f acts inasmuch as there is
no s u p p r e s s io n o r c o n c e al me n t o r f ur n is h in g of in ac
c u r ate p ar t ic u l ar s o r making a wrong claim which is found to be
false. There is no suppression, concealment or furnishing of ITA Nos. 6267 to
6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 19 -
inaccurate particulars nor the AG has stated as to wh at is the suppression,
conceal men t or f urnish ing of in ac curate particulars and therefore even
on this account the penalty is bad in law.
k . In an y c as e , th e T P G ad o p te d 7 . 5 % an d b e n c h ma r k e d
th e tr an s ac t io n whereas the same was rejected by the IT AT and the has
adopted LIBOR plus 150 to benchmark the transaction. It is submitted that on
such an issue where there is a difference of opinion no penalty can be levied
under section 271(1)(c) of the Act. It is f urther submitted that there has
been a complete disclosure in the course of the assessment proceedings of the
reasons for n o n - c h ar g in g of in te r e s t an d th e r ef o r e th e
al l e g a t io n of s u p p r es s ion , conceal men t or f urnishing of inac
curate p articul ars does not arise. T he initiation if at all was on the
basis of ALP adjustment of 7.5% made by the TPO which has totally been
rejected by the Tribunal who adopted LIBOR p l us 1 5 0 b p s . It is s u b mi
t t e d th a t th e A O / T P O h av e n o t r e c o rd e d an y satisfaction
on LIBOR plus 150 bps and therefore penalty is bad in law. Even otherwise the
approach of 7.5% is incorrect because the said interest rate of 7.5% is ad
opted by the T PO by tak ing the con trolled tr ans ac tion as a comparable.
i. It is further submitted that based on the above submissions, the assessee
has discharged its onus cast by Explanation 7 to section 271(1)(c) of the A c
t wh ic h s tate s th at if the as s e s s e e ac te d in g o od f aith an d
with d u e diligence then no penalty should be levied.
m) In any vie w of the matter and without prejudice to above, it is sub mitted
that the AG was not justif ied in levying penal ty on T P ad justment of Rs.
9.22 cr. since the ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to
245/Mum/2019
\- 20 -
adjustment sustained af ter the Tribunal's order was Rs. 7.64 Cr. only.
n. Reliance is placed on following decisions where the penalty u/s Explanation
7 r/w 271(1)(c) was deleted on similar grounds as stated above:
I. Giesecke and Devrient (I) Pvt. Ltd. v. DCIT reported in 53 CCH 240 (Del).
ii. Harlcrow Consulting India Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT reported in 51 CCH 644 (Del).
iii. Verizon Communication India P. Ltd. vs. DCIT reported in 33 CCH 277
(Del).
o) The show cause notice at page 6 of the paperbook shows that the AO has not
struck off either of the limbs of Section 271(1)(c). Hence on this ground
itself penalty under section 271(1)(c) cannot be levied. Reliance is placed in
the following decisions -
• CIT vs SSA's Emerald Meadows (SC). ITA No 380 of 2015 • CIT vs Samson
Perinchery (SLP)(392 ITR 4) (BOM) • CIT vs Manjunatha Cotton & Ginning Factory

transaction of interest free loan given by the assessee to its AE, RIME DMCC.
10\. We have heard both the parties, perused the material available on record
and gone through orders of the authorities below. We find that, as regards,
penalty levied on disallowance of depression on steel purchases, the issue has
been considered by the Coordinate Bench of the ITAT in assessee's own case for
the A.Y 2003-04 to 2006-07 in ITA No. 7219 to 7221/Mum/2011, where under
identical set of facts the penalty levied on additions towards depreciation on
steel purchases has been deleted. This fact has not been disputed by the Ld.
DR. Therefore, by following the decision of Coordinate Bench, in assessee's
own case for earlier years, we are of the considered view that the Ld. CIT(A)
was right in deleting penalty on additions towards disallowance of
depreciation on steel purchases and hence, we are inclined to uphold the
finding and reject the ground taken by the Revenue.
10.1 In so far as, penalty levied on additions towards disallowance of
professional fees, we find that the additions made by the A.O towards
disallowance of professional fees ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243
to 245/Mum/2019
\- 22 -
to S.K Gupta Group of Companies has been finally deleted by the ITAT in
quantum proceedings in ITA No. 4361/Mum/2012 vide order dated 12.04.2017,
where the additions made by the A.O towards disallowance of profession fees
has been deleted. Once the addition on which the penalty levied has been
deleted by the appellate authorities, then penalty levied on said addition
cannot survive. Therefore, we are of the considered view that there is no
error in findings recorded by the Ld. CIT(A) while deleting penalty levied in
respect of disallowance of professional fees and hence, we reject the ground
taken by the Revenue.
10.2 As regards, the penalty levied on additions towards transfer pricing
adjustment u/s 92C of the Act, towards interest on loans to subsidiaries, we
find that although the A.O has levied penalty for furnishing inaccurate
particulars of income, but fact remains that the assessee has disclosed
necessary facts required for computation of total income in the return of
income filed for the year which is evident from the fact that detailed note
has been annexed to statement of total income filed for the year and explained
the facts with regard to loans to subsidiaries. We further noted that ITA Nos.
6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 23 -
whether transfer pricing adjustments can be made in respect of loans to
subsidiaries when such loan has been given to the AE to increase and expand
the business of the assessee is a debatable issue, which is evident from the
fact that the Jurisdictional High Court of Bombay in the case of Piramal Glass
Limited Vs. DCIT in income tax appeal No. 1255 of 2017 vide order dated
08.09.2018 has admitted the question of law on whether transfer pricing
adjustment is required to be made on loans given to AE to increase and expand
the business of the assessee. In this case, on perusal of facts, it is noted
that the assessee had also lend monies to its AE on account of business
expediency. Further, admission of appeal by the Hon'ble High Court indicates
that the question is an arguable point in law, on which two views are possible
and therefore, we are of the considered view that it is not a case for penalty
u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. In
this regard, we took support from the decision of ITAT Delhi Bench in the case
of HCL Perot Systems Ltd., Vs. ACIT (supra), where it has been held that since
the transfer pricing adjustment on the issue of interest free loan is admitted
as substantial question of law by the Hon'ble High Court, no penalty can be
levied. This is further ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to
245/Mum/2019
\- 24 -
fortified by the decision of Jurisdictional High Court of Bombay in the case
of PCIT VS. Dhariwal Industries Pvt Ltd., in Income Tax appeal No.
1133/1136/1129 of 2016, where it was held that when the question of law is
admitted there is no question of levying penalty. We further noted that the
issue whether transfer pricing adjustment can be made in respect of interest
free loan to a subsidiary is a subject matter which falls into debatable
issue. This is evident from the fact that the ITAT had constituted a Special
Bench of three Members to adjudicate this addition. The Special Bench after
deliberating in depth various arguments in the case of Instrumentarium Corp.
Ltd., Vs. ADIT reported in (2016) 71 taxman.com 193 (Kol Trib) (SB), held that
such a transition requires transfer pricing adjustment. Further, the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court in the case of Tooltech Global Engineering Pvt Ltd., Vs.
ACIT reported in [2018] 254 taxman 241 (Bombay) also held that such a
transaction requires transfer pricing adjustment. Further, the ITAT, in the
case of Siro Clinpharma Pvt. Ltd., in ITA No. 2618/Mum/2014 has held that the
retrospective amendment to the definition of international transaction by the
Finance Act 2012 would be applicable only post 2012 and not prior thereto.
This is also shows that even after ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos.
243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 25 -
retrospective amendment the issue is highly debatable. Therefore, we are of
the considered view that, once there are divergent views on the issue by
various Courts and Tribunals, then it clearly shows that the said issue is
debatable issue and always two views are possible. When the issue is debatable
and always two views are possible, then on such issues the penalty provided
u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act cannot be invited for furnishing inaccurate
particulars of income.
10.3 It is settled position of law, has held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
CIT Vs. Onkar Saran and Sons reported in 120 ITR 01 (SC) and CIT Vs. Onkar
Saran & Sons reported 195 ITR 01 (SC) that law on the date of filing the
return should be seen for adjudicating whether penalty should be levied. It is
therefore, necessary to examine the position of law as prevailed at the time
of filing of return of income to decide the issue whether said adjustment is
required to be made and also it comes under the purview of the provisions of
Sec. 271(1)(c) of the Act to levy of penalty for furnishing inaccurate
particulars of income. It is an admitted fact that, at the time of filing of
return of income the issue is debatable and which has attained finality ITA
Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 26 -
much later. Further, the transfer pricing provisions were first introduced in
the statue in the FY 2001-02 and the law was in an incipient stage at the
point of filing return of income, when the issues first arose. In fact, the
first assessment cycle under the transfer pricing provisions for A.Y 2002-03
was completed by 31.03.2005 and hence by the time, filing of return of income
for A.Y 2008-09, there was not much judicial clarity on the issue. Further, no
guidelines were also issued by the CBDT on this issue. From the above, it is
very clear that the issue of transfer pricing adjustment u/s 92C of the Act,
in respect of loans to subsidiaries is a debatable issue and on such issue
penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act should not be levied.
10.4 We further noted that the assessee had advanced interest free loan to its
subsidiary for expanding itself in the international market for acquisition of
majority stake in Gapco Group which was engaged in marketing of petroleum
products in African countries. The said explanation has not been disputed by
the revenue authorities and the transaction amounts to capital financing and
the said capital financing was brought within the definition of international
transaction by inserting explanation to Sec.
ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 27 -
92B by the finance Act 2012 with retrospective effect from 01.04.2002. Until
the retrospective amendment was brought to the provisions of Sec. 92B of the
Act, there was no clarity on the issue whether it construeds an international
transaction or not. Even after amendment there are certain judicial precedents
which says that the amendment brought into the statue by the Financial Act
2012 with retrospective effect from 01.04.2002 is applicable only post 2012
and not prior thereto. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the
matter involved in the present case i.e transfer pricing adjustment towards
loan to subsidiaries is a debatable issue and there is always two views are
possible. Once the issue is debatable and two views are possible and also said
issue has been admitted by the Hon'ble High Court for deciding the question of
law, then the same cannot be considered for the purpose of levying penalty u/s
271(1)(c) of the Act, for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. We,
further, noted that in any case the TPO adopted 7.5% rate of interest for
bench marking the transaction, whereas the same was rejected by the ITAT and
the ITAT has adopted LIBOR+150 basis to bench mark the transaction. Therefore,
on this issue when there is a difference of opinion, no penalty can be levied
u/s ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 28 -
271(1)(c) of the Act. We further noted that the assessee has disclosed
complete details in respect of loans to subsidiaries and reasons for non-
charging of interest on said loans. Therefore, the allegation of the A.O that
the assessee has concealed particulars of income or furnished inaccurate
particulars of income in respect of loans to subsidiaries is incorrect.
Therefore, we are of the considered view that the assessee has discharged its
onus cast upon by explanation 271(1)(c) of the Act, which states that, if the
assessee acts with good faith and due diligence then no penalty should be
levied. Hence, we are of the considered view that the A.O was erred in levied
penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, in respect of transfer pricing adjustment
made u/s 92C of the Act, towards interest on loan to subsidiaries. The Ld.
CIT(A) after considering the relevant facts has rightly deleted penalty levied
by the A.O, and hence, we are inclined to uphold the findings of the Ld.
CIT(A) and reject ground taken by the Revenue.
11\. In the result, the appeal filed by the Revenue is dismissed.
ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 29 -
ITA Nos. 6269 & 6267/Mum/2018
12\. In these two appeals, facts are exactly identical to the facts and issues
which we had already considered in ITA No. 6268/Mum/2018, except to the
limited extent of determination of income for the year under the provisions of
Section115JB of the Act. Therefore, the Ld. AR for the assessee has made an
argument in light of CBDT Circular No. 25/2015 dated 31.12.2015 that if income
tax payable on the total income as computed under normal provisions of the
Act, is less than the tax payable on the book profits u/s 115JB of the Act,
then the penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act is not attracted with reference to
additions / disallowances made under normal provisions of the Income Tax Act,
1961. The Ld. AR further submitted that in this case as per the latest order
issued u/s 154 dated 20.07.2017, the assessee was assessed to tax under MAT
provisions of 115JB of the Act and in view of Circular of CBDT No. 25/2015, no
penalty can be levied in respect of additions made to the total income
computed under normal provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
13\. Ld. DR on the other hand, fairly accepted that for these two years
penalty levied by the A.O u/s 271(1)(c) of ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO
Nos. 243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 30 -
the Act, cannot be survived, because the income tax payable on the total
income as computed under the normal provisions of the Act, is less than the
tax payable on the book profits computed u/s 115JB of the Act.
14\. We have heard both the parties, perused the material available on record
and gone through orders of the authorities below. We find that the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Nalwa Investments Ltd., [2010] 327 ITR
543 (Del) had considered on identical issue and after considering the relevant
provisions of the Act, held that when tax payable on income computed under
normal provisions of the Act is less than tax payable under the provisions of
Sec. 115JB of the Act, then penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act could not be
imposed with reference to additions / disallowances made under normal
provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961\. The CBDT had issued a circular No.
25/2015 dated 31.12.2015, where it has accepted the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi
High Court and accordingly issued a circular explaining the position of law
before insertion of explanation 4 to sub Sec. (1) of Sec. 271(1)(c) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 by the Finance Act 2015, which provides for method of
calculation of amount of tax sought ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos.
243 to 245/Mum/2019
\- 31 -
to be evaded for situations, where the income determined under the normal
provision is less than the income declared for the purpose of MAT provision
u/s 115JB of the Act. Accordingly, it has clarified that where the income tax
payable on the total income as computed under the normal provisions is less
than the tax payable on the book profits computed u/s 115JB of the Act, then
penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act is not attracted with reference to additions
/ disallowances made under normal provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. In
this case, it is an admitted fact that, as per the order of the A.O u/s 154 of
the Act, dated 20.07.2016 the assessee was assessed to tax under provisions of
115JB of the Income Tax, 1961, although the A.O has made various additions
towards total income computed under normal provisions of the Income Tax Act,
1961\. Therefore, We are of the considered view that penalty u/s 271(1)(c) of
the Act cannot be levied with reference to additions / disallowances made to
income computed under normal provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
15\. We further noted that an identical issue has been considered by the
coordinate Bench of the ITAT Mumbai in the case of Kapil Rayon India Pvt Ltd.,
Vs. ITO in ITA No. ITA Nos. 6267 to 6269/Mum/2018 & CO Nos. 243 to

5946/Mum/2018, where under identical set of facts it has been held that when
income is computed under the provisions of Sec. 115JB of the Act, then penalty
u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act cannot be levied in respect of additions made towards
total income computed under the normal provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961. The
relevant findings of the Tribunal are as under:

16\. In this view of the matter and by following the decision of Coordinate
Bench at ITAT, Mumbai in the case of Kapil Royan India Pvt Ltd., Vs ITO
(Supra), we are of the considered view that the Ld. CIT(A) was right in
deleting penalty levied u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act for A.Ys 2007-08 & 2009-10.
Hence, we are inclined to uphold the findings of the Ld. CIT(A) and dismissed
appeal filed by the Revenue for both assessment years.
17\. As a result, appeal filed by the revenue for A.Y 2007- 08, 2008-09 and
2009-10 are dismissed.

18\. The assessee has filed these cross objections in support of order of the
Ld. CIT(A). Although, the assessee has filed one more ground challenging
validity of penalty proceedings initiated u/s 271(1)(c) of the Act, in light
of show cause notice issued by the A.O u/s 274 r.w.s 271 of the Act, but fact
remains that the penalty levied by the A.O u/s 271(1)(c) has been deleted for
all assessment years. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Cross
Objections filed by the assessee for all assessment years becomes infructuous
and hence, the same were dismissed as not maintainable.
19\. In the result, the appeals filed by the Revenue and Cross Objections
filed by the assessee are dismissed.
