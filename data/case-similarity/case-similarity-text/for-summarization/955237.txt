and be observed with regard to-
(a) debts provable;
(b) the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities; and
(c) the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors; as are in force
for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of
persons adjudged insolvent: 1 Provided that the security of every secured
creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the
workmen to the extent of the workmen' s portion therein, and, where a secured
creditor, instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debt, opts to
realise his security,-
(a) the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such
charge;
(b) any amount realised by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge
shall be applied ratably for the discharge of workmen' s dues; and
(c) so much of the debt due to such secured creditor as could not be realised
by him by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this proviso or the amount of
(8 of 1923 ), rights capable of being transferred to and vested in the
workman, all amounts due in respect of any compensation or liability for
compensation under the said Act in res- pect of the death or disablement of
any workman of the company;

gratuity fund or any other fund for the welfare of the workmen, maintained by
the company;
(c) " workmen' s portion", in relation to the security of any secured creditor
of a company, means the amount which bears to the value of the security the
same proportion as the amount of the workmen' s dues bears to the aggregate
of-
(i) the amount of workmen' s dues; and
(ii) the amounts of the debts due to the secured creditors. Illustration The
value of the security of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1, 00, 000.
The total amount of the workmen' s dues is Rs. 1, 00, 000. The amount of the
debts due from the company to its secured creditors is Rs. 3, 00, 000. The

passu with the workmen' s dues for the purposes of section 529A.]
(2) All persons who in any such case would be entitled to prove for and
receive dividends out of the assets of the company, may come in under the
winding up, and make such claims against the company as they respectively are
entitled to make by virtue of this section, 2 Provided that if a secured
creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving for his debt
proceeds to realise his security, he shall be liable to 3 pay his portion of
the expenses] incurred by the liquidator (including a provisional liquidator,
if any) for the preservation of the security before its realization by the
secured creditor.] 1 Explanation.- For the purposes of this proviso, the
portion of expenses incurred by the liquidator for the preservation of a
security which the secured creditor shall be liable to pay shall be the whole

the security.]
