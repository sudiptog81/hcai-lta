5\. The learned AO's order based on the findings of the learned Transfer
Pricing Officer and the directions of the learned Dispute Resolution Panel
u/s.144C(5) of the Income- tax, is erroneous, untenable in law and on facts
for the various reasons and not limited to the following: -

3\. Ground Nos.1 to 4 being general in nature are dismissed. Ground of appeal
No. 5 to 7 relate to inclusion/exclusion of certain comparables.
4\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that the assessee is a subsidiary of
Rolls Royce Overseas Holding Limited and operates in India primarily in the
power generation  3 ITA No.658/Del/2017 and oil and gas markets with a range
of reciprocating engines covering gas engines, HFO engines and crude oil
engines. It also undertakes servicing contracts wherein it purchases spare
parts from overseas Rolls Royce entities for subsequent sale. The company also
undertakes services such as repair and maintenance and other services
including technical project management and marketing support. It filed its
return of income on 9th October, 2013 declaring total income of
Rs.75,72,74,676/-. The Assessing Officer referred the matter to the TPO u/s
92CA for determination of the arm's length price of the international
transaction entered into by the assessee. The TPO noted that the assessee
during the year under consideration has entered into the following
transactions:-
    No.    Nature of transaction                          Method
                                                                         Value of transaction (in Rs.)
    1.     Purchase of spares for trading                 TNMM (PLI as                        8,18,13,383
                                                          OP/OR)
    2.     Provision of technical services                                                    5,72,53,977
    3.     Provision of project management Services       TNMM (PLI as                        1,24,70,910
    4.     Provision of Marketing Support Services        OP/OC)                             40,11,67,754
    5.     Recharge of payroll expenses                                                       1,41,34,741
    6.     Reimbursement of Bank Guarantee Charges                                               1,96,053
                                                          NA
    7.     Reimbursement of Insurance Charges                                                   26,19,566
    8.     Recharge of expenses                                                              13,00,47,169
5\. While the TPO accepted the purchase of spares for trading and recharge of
expenses, however, he did not accept the TP approach of the assessee for the
service segment. According to the TPO, the services rendered by the assessee
are high-end support services. After applying various filters, the TPO
proposed the following comparables, whose average OP/OC is 30.66%, the details
of which are as under:-
4
> ITA No.658/Del/2017 S.No Company Name OP/OC (%) 1 Apitco Ltd. 20.46 2 B VG
> India Ltd. 24.46 3 H S C C (India) Ltd. 48.83 4 ICR A Management Consulting
> Services Ltd. 6.62 5 Info Edge (India) Ltd. 56.79 6 Kitco Ltd. 37.97 7 Tata
> Consulting Engineers Ltd. 19.47 Average 30.66
6\. Rejecting the submissions of the assessee that it was providing simple
business support services and not high end marketing support services and,
therefore, the comparables should be taken from the segment broadly classified
as ''Business support services' and observing that in the past also the same
approach was adopted by him has been followed, the TPO finally adopted the
following comparables for benchmarking the international transaction in
support services:-
> S.No Company Name OP/OC
> 1\. Apitco Ltd. 20.46
> -â–  r-S H S C C (India) Ltd.
          2.                                                                         48.83
          3.      ICRA Management Consulting Services Ltd.                            6.62
          4.      Info Edge (India) Ltd.                                             56.79
          5.      Kitco Ltd.                                                         37.97
          6.      Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd.                                     19.47
          7.      UB Engineering                                                       6.1
                               Average                                               28.03
> 7\. Accordingly, he proposed an upward adjustment of Rs.6,22,45,975/-. The
> assessee approached the DRP. The DRP rejected all the contentions of the
> assessee. However, the DRP directed the TPO to recompute/benchmark the
> margin of M/s UB Engineering Ltd. The Assessing Officer, thereafter,
> calculated  5 ITA No.658/Del/2017 the arm's length price and revised the
> same to Rs.5,97,94,267/- as against Rs.6,22,45,975/- made earlier.
8\. Aggrieved with such order of the A.O./TPO/DRP, the assessee is in appeal
before the Tribunal.
9\. The ld. counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee is operating
in trading and service segment and the only area of dispute is the service
segment comprising PMS, MSS and technical services. In AE service segment, the
assessee is providing more than 95% of the risk free services and only 10%
technical services. Referring to page 209 of the paper book, he submitted that
this was also submitted before the Assessing Officer. Further, there is no
change in the facts from assessment year 2007-08 onwards including assessment
year 2011-12. He submitted that the assessee had selected 11 comparables with
15.63% margin based on three year average as per TP study copy of which is
placed at page 175 of the paper book. He submitted that out of seven
comparables proposed by the TPO, only three comparables selected by the
assessee were included. So far as the various comparables selected by the TPO
and upheld by the DRP are concerned, the ld. counsel for the assessee
submitted that the assessee is non-risk bearing in support services segment
and high end chosen by the TPO and upheld by the DRP should be excluded.
Referring to the order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for assessment
year 2010-11 and 2011-12, he submitted that the Tribunal has given the finding
that the assessee is providing approximately 90% of risk free support  6 ITA
No.658/Del/2017 services and the comparables should be selected which assumes
low or no risk. He submitted that there is no change in facts of the case
during the year under consideration. He submitted that the revenue in support
service segment is Rs.42.62 crores while in technical service it is
Rs.5.27crores. Thus, 89% of total service income is from rendering support
service. So far as the allegation of the TPO that the services provided by the
assessee are high end support services, he submitted that the Tribunal has
already given a finding in assessee's own case that the assessee is a non-risk
bearing service provider. It is also evident from the support service
agreement, copy of which is placed at page 222 to 243 of the paper book. Now,
coming to the various comparables selected by the TPO, the ld. counsel filed
the following chart:-

                                                              Pvt. Ltd. vs. DCIT in ITA
                                                              No.882/Del/2014.
                                                              Thus this comparable is
                                                              prayed to excluded due to
                                                              functionally different and
                                                              being government company.
10\. Referring to the order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case for
assessment year 2010-11and 2011-12, copy of which is placed at page 317 to 341
of the paper book, he submitted that the Tribunal has held that such
comparables should be selected which are providing non-risk bearing business
support services. If above mentioned high end technical services comparables
are excluded from the final list of comparables, then, average PLI of the
remaining comparables shall be 6.36%.
9
ITA No.658/Del/2017
11\. So far as the inclusion of Cyber Media Research & Services in the final
list of comparables is concerned, he submitted that the TPO did not include
the above comparable in the final list of comparables although it passes all
the filters of TPO's search process. He submitted that since this comparable
is functionally similar to that of the assessee and was taken as the
assessee's comparable in the preceding two years, therefore, this comparable
should be included in the final list of comparables. Referring to the decision
of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Siemens Technology Services
Pvt. Ltd. [TS-220-ITAT-2016 (MUM)- TP], he submitted that the Tribunal in the
said decision has held that if a company was a good comparable in earlier
years because of functional similarity, it should have been included for
arriving at the average PLI of comparables. So far as inclusion of Cyber Media
Research & Services is concerned, he submitted that the assessee had filed
objections before the TPO for not including the above comparable. However, the
TPO had excluded this comparable merely because its turnover decreased from
the previous year from Rs.12.70 crore to Rs.3.33 crore in the year under
consideration and alleged abnormal reduction in revenue. He submitted that
this observation of the TPO is without any basis since in subsequent year it
again increased to 5.61 crore. He submitted that the TPO had applied turnover
criteria for obtaining comparables of above Rs.1 crore as per page 12 of the
TPO's order. Therefore, the TPO cannot artificially reject this criteria and
apply any turnover test for rejecting this company. He submitted that the DRP
in para 10 of the order has upheld the exclusion of this comparable for being
10 ITA No.658/Del/2017 functionally different. Since there is no abnormal
business circumstances in the year under consideration so as to warrant
exclusion of Cyber Media Research & Services from the final list of
comparables when it was a good comparable in the last two years, therefore, he
submitted that this company should be included in the final list of
comparables. Referring to the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in
the case of Trend Micro India Pvt. Ltd. [TS-556-ITAT-2015 (DEL)- TP], he
submitted that the Tribunal in the said decision has held that the Revenue
cannot challenge own comparables absent CIT(A)/DRP directions.
12\. So far as the exclusion of assessee's comparables, namely Office Care and
Vatika Marketing from the final list of comparables are concerned, he
submitted that both the companies are functionally similar to the assessee's
support services segment. So far as Office Care Services Ltd. is concerned, he
submitted that the company is engaged in providing housekeeping support
services for offices and homes, electrical maintenance work, civil management,
manpower of support services and other allied services. Since this company
performs the same kind of support functions as the functions performed by the
assessee, therefore, this company should be included in the final list of
comparables. Further, the company does not fail 75% service income filter as
alleged by the TPO at page 9 of his order. Referring to the Profits & Loss
Account of the above company, he submitted that there is revenue of Rs.7.16
crore and no revenue from trading or finished goods sale as there is no or
negligible cost of goods and nil inventory.  11
ITA No.658/Del/2017 12.1 So far as Vatika Marketing Ltd. is concerned, he
submitted that the company was set up by Ashiana Housing group and is engaged
in providing building repair and maintenance services and performs the similar
kind of support functions as the functions performed by the assessee. This
company does not fail 75% service income filter as alleged by the TPO at page
10 of his order. He submitted that out of total revenue of Rs.11.13 crore, an
amount of Rs.9.85 crore is from service income and there is no revenue from
trading or finished goods sale as there is no or negligible cost of goods and
nil inventory. Accordingly, he submitted that this company should be included
in the final list of comparables. He submitted that the ld. DRP upheld the
exclusion of the above two comparables in an ad hoc manner by just referring
to the reasoning given by the TPO and without giving any cogent reason for not
appreciating the submissions of the assessee. He accordingly submitted that
both the companies be included in the final list of comparables.
13\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, strongly supported the order of the
A.O./TPO/DRP. So far as the various comparables which have been tested by the
Tribunal in assessee's case in the preceding years are concerned, she relied
on the order of the A.O./TPO/DRP. So far as the new comparables are concerned,
she submitted that the FAR analysis has not been considered by the
A.O./TPO/DRP and, therefore, merely on the basis of the submissions made by
the ld. counsel for the assessee, these companies cannot be included/excluded.
She submitted that she  12 ITA No.658/Del/2017 has no objection if these
comparables are restored to the file of TPO/A.O. for verification of the
functionality test and the FAR analysis.
14\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides. So far as
the companies Aptico Ltd. and Kitco Ltd. are concerned, we find the Tribunal
in assessee's own case, vide ITA No.6336/Del/2015, order dated 22nd April,
2016 for assessment year 2011-12, has directed the TPO for exclusion of the
companies holding that they are functionally different and they are not
comparable with that of the assessee. The relevant observations of the
Tribunal at para 15-16 of the order reads as under:-
> "15. We have carefully considered the rival contentions. Comparable No.1
> Apitco Ltd. and no 2. Kitco Ltd. are submitted to functionally not
> comparable and further it is submitted that they have been considered by the
> coordinate bench in the order of the assessee for A.Y. 2010-11 in assessee's
> own case as under:-
> "36. The second comparable, inclusion of which is disputed by the assessee,

> enterprise development, skill development, project management consulting,
> industrial cluster development, environmental management consulting, energy

> 37\. From a bare perusal of the services rendered by Apitco Ltd. it is clear

13
> ITA No.658/Del/2017 KITCOLTD.
38\. The functional profile of this company, as given in the synopsis filed by
the assessee, is as under:
"1. KITCO, the first technical consultancy organization(TCO) in India, was
established in 1972 by Industrial Development Bank of India, other national
and state level financial institutions, Govt. of Kerala and 7 Public Sector
Banks for rendering services to Entrepreneurs, Govt. Departmental PSUs, Local
Bodies, etc. Presently, Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is
the prime shareholder with 49% shares of the company.
2\. The aim of setting up of TCO, which had the blessing of Govt. of India and
the Reserve Bank of India, was to provide professional technical consultancy
assistance to banks by appraisal of projects for priority sector lending and
to entrepreneurs in the 5MB Sector by way of preparation of Project Reports &
Market Studies and conducting training programmes for entrepreneurship
development. Subsequently similar TCOs were set up in almost all the states
with one of the National Financial Institutions (IDBI, IFCI or ICICI) as the
prime shareholder.
3\. KITCO has successfully implemented projects like Cochin International
Airport Ltd., Titanium Sponge Project, International Marina, Cochin Special
Economic Zone, etc and presently implementing a multimodal Mobility Hub at
Cochin, all of which are first of its kind in the country in their own
respect. KITCO has successfully completed the Phase-1 of CIAL Golf Course &
Country Club and Ghallah Wentworth Golf Course at Muscat, Sultanate of Oman,
thereby establishing itself in an area, which was considered to be the forte
of European Consultants. The prestigious overseas assignments KITCO so far has
completed include the technical evaluation of electrical power distribution
network at King Abdul Aziz International Airport, Jeddah.
4\. All its clients are either central government, state government, PSU etc.
Snapshot enclosed.
5\. It is working In divisions like infrastructure, tourism, aviation, IT
services, HRD, financial services etc. which are dissimilar to the functional
profile of the assessee company. Snapshot enclosed.
39\. From the above submissions it is evident that this comparable is not
functionally comparable with the assessee because it is the nature of services
rendered and not per se rendering of services is relevant in accepting or
rejecting a company as comparable.  14
ITA No.658/Del/2017 Therefore, we direct exclusion of this comparable from the
list of comparables."
16\. In view of above finding of coordinate bench for exclusion of Aptico and
Kitco Ltd. holding that they are functionally different Rolls Royce India
Private Limited V DCIT ITA No 6636 Del 2015 A.Y. 2011-12 and are not
comparable with the assessee. Therefore respectfully following the decision of
coordinate bench we direct to exclude both these comparables accordingly."
15\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own
case and in absence of any contrary material brought to our notice, we direct
the A.O./TPO exclude the above two companies from the list of comparables.
15.1 So far as Info Edge (India) Pvt. Ltd. is concerned, we find the Tribunal
in assessee's own case in the immediately preceding assessment year at para 21
of the order has discussed the issue and has directed the TPO for exclusion of
this comparable. The relevant observation of the Tribunal at para 21 reads as
under:-
> "21. Regarding Infoedge India Pvt. Ltd we are of the view that this company
> has been included by the TPO holding that it is functionally comparable.
> Assessee contended before the ld. TPO as well as DRP that this company is
> functionally not comparable in view of it engaged in management of online
> portals and also has major sources of revenue as advertisement income. Both
> the lower authorities rejected the contention of the assessee. We have
> carefully considered the rival contentions. It is apparent that the
> comparable selected by TPO is engaged in online portal activities such as
> employment website, matrimonial website and its major revenue is
> advertisement and subscriptions. It has diversified services such as
> recruitment related, real estate related, matrimonial related services and
> owns significant Rolls Royce India Private Limited V DCIT ITA No 6636 Del
> 2015 A.Y. 2011-12 intangibles/websites such as naukri.com, 99 acre.com
> etc.Therefore this company is functionally different as it is providing an

> buyer and seller of the services compared to services provided by the
> assessee of marketing support services . In view of this we direct ld. TPO

15
> ITA No.658/Del/2017
> 16\. Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own
> case and in the absence of any contrary material brought to our notice, we
> direct the TPO to exclude this company from the list of comparables.
17\. So far as TCE Consulting Engineers Ltd., is concerned, we find the
Tribunal in assessee's own case in the immediately preceding assessment year
at para 17 of the order has discussed the issue and has directed the A.O./TPO
to exclude this company from the list of comparables. The relevant observation
of the Tribunal reads as under:-
> "17. Regarding TCE Consulting Engineers Ltd. it is submitted that it is also
> engaged in providing highly technical services. The profile submitted by the
> assessee shows that it has successfully managed complex engineering projects
> across the infrastructure spectrum and also associated with prestigious
> urban infrastructure facilities such as Airports, Railway and Aerotropolis
> engineering consulting projects. Therefore it is apparent that this company
> is engaged in providing high end engineering consulting services which is
> not comparable with the functional analysis of the assessee. Therefore we
> direct to exclude this comparable."
18\. Respectfully following the order of the Tribunal in assessee's own case
and in absence of any contrary material brought to our notice, we direct the
A.O./TPO to exclude this company from the list of comparables.
19\. So far as HSCC (India) Ltd. is concerned, we find the Tribunal in
assessee's own case for the immediately preceding assessment year at para 24
of the order has discussed the issue and restored the issue to the file of the
TPO with certain directions by observing as under:-
16
> ITA No.658/Del/2017 "24. The next comparable is HSCC India Ltd. which has
> been included by ld. TPO based on page no.7 of the annual report of that
> company. However, on reading of the order of TPO we do not find any argument
> of the assessee regarding exclusion of this comparable. On reading of the
> order of the DRP also this comparable was not objected to its inclusion by
> TPO. Only objection was raised regarding correction of the margins andthis
> grievance of the assessee is resolved by ld. DRP. In view of this
> respectfully following the decision of honourable special bench in Deputy
> Commissioner of Income-tax V Quark Systems (P.) Ltd. 2010] 38 SOT 307 (CHD.)
> (SB) We remit this comparable back to the file of the Ld. TPO for exclusion
> or retention of this comparable as plea for its exclusion has been raised
> before us for the first time."
19.1 Respectfully following the decision of the Tribunal in assessee's own
case, we restore this issue to the file of the TPO/A.O. for fresh adjudication
of the issue in the light of the direction of the Tribunal.
20\. So far as inclusion of Cyber Media Research & Services in the final list
of comparables is concerned, it is the submission of the ld. counsel for the
assessee that it passes all the filters adopted by the TPO. It has also been
the submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee that since this company is
functionally similar and was taken as assessee's comparable in previous two
years i.e., 2010-11 and 2011- 12, therefore, this being a good comparable in
the earlier years because of functional similarity, it should be included in
the list of comparables. In view of the above submission of the ld. counsel
for the assessee, we restore this issue to the file of the A.O./TPO with a
direction to verify as to whether the above company passes the filters adopted
by the TPO himself and in case it passes all the filters adopted by the TPO,
then, the TPO/A.O. is directed to include this company as a comparable for
arriving at the average PLI of the comparables.  17
ITA No.658/Del/2017
21\. So far as the company Cyber Media Research & Services is concerned, we
find the TPO excluded this company merely because its turnover decreased from
Rs.12.70 crore the previous year to Rs.3.33 Crore in the year under
consideration. It is the submission of the ld. counsel that in subsequent year
the turnover has gone up to Rs.5.61 crore. Further, the TPO has applied the
turnover criteria of more than Rs.1 crore and, therefore, it is the submission
of the ld. counsel that the TPO should not have artificially rejected this
criteria and applied another turnover test for rejecting this comparable. We
find force in the above argument of the ld. counsel. However, the submission
of the ld. counsel that the turnover of the above comparable company has gone
up in the subsequent year and that it passes all the filters of the TPO needs
verification at the level of A.O./TPO. We, therefore, remit this issue to the
file of A.O./TPO with a direction to verify as to whether the turnover has
gone up to Rs.5.61 crore in the subsequent year as against Rs.3.33 crore in
the current year and, if the same is found to be correct, then, this company
should be included in the list of comparables.
22\. So far as Office Care Services Ltd. is concerned, it is the submission of
the ld. counsel for the assessee that this company is engaged in providing
house keeping support services for offices and homes, electrical maintenance
work, civil management, manpower support services and other allied services.
Thus, it is his submission that this company performs the similar kind of
support functions as the functions performed by the assessee and it does not
fail 75% service income filter.  18
ITA No.658/Del/2017 It is the submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee
that this company has earned the revenue of Rs.7.16 crore and no revenue from
trading or finished goods sale. We, therefore, deem it proper to restore this
issue to the file of the TPO with a direction to verify that this company does
not fail the 75% service income filter and performs the similar kind of
support functions as performed by the assessee company. In case the same is
found to be correct, then, the A.O./TPO is directed to include this company in
the list of comparables.
23\. So far as Vatika Marketing Ltd. is concerned, here also, it is the
submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee that it is engaged in providing
building repair & maintenance services and performs the similar kind of
support functions as the functions performed by the assessee and does not fail
75% service income filter. According to the ld. counsel, out of the total
revenue of Rs.11.13 crore, an amount of Rs.9.85 crore is from service income
and there is no revenue from trading or finished goods sale as there is no or
negligible cost of goods and nil inventory. We, therefore, deem it proper to
restore this issue to the file of the A.O./TPO with a direction to verify that
it does not fail 75% service income filter as alleged by him in the order and
also to verify as to whether the above companies perform similar kind of
support functions as performed by the assessee company and if found correct,
then to retain this company in the final list of comparables. Ground of appeal
No.5 to 7 are accordingly allowed in the terms indicated above.  19
ITA No.658/Del/2017
24\. Ground of appeal No.8 was not pressed by the assessee for which ld. DR
has no objection. Accordingly the same is dismissed.
25\. The Corporate Tax grounds and other grounds are as under:-
> "Corporate Tax
> 10\. That the Ld. DRP/AO has erred in law in confirming the addition on
> account of unbilled revenue write off and security deposit write off of Rs.
> 1,15,59,310 & Rs. 12,98,441/- respectively.
> 11\. That the Hon'ble DRP has erred in law and on facts in holding that
> unbilled revenue write off shall be entitled to be allowed only when found
> to be credited again in books of the assessee in subsequent year.
> 12\. That the Hon'ble DRP has erred in law in not appreciating that the
> condition of Sec 36(l)(vii) read with Sec 36(2) has already been complied
> with to claim the allowance of unbilled revenue write off.
> 13\. That the Hon'ble DRP and consequently Ld. AO has grossly erred in law
> and on facts, in the circumstances of the appellant's case in confirming the
> addition of security deposit written off amounting to Rs. 12,98,441/- merely
> on the basis of assumptions, surmises and conjectures.
> 14\. That the Hon'ble DRP has erred in law in holding that the claim of

> contract earned by the assessee in the course of its business.
> Common Grounds
> 15\. That the penalty proceedings initiated u/s Sec 271(l)(c ) are on wholly
> illegal and untenable grounds since there was no concealment of any income
> nor submission of inaccurate particulars of income, nor any default
> according to law by the assessee.
> 16\. That the interest charged u/s Sec 234B and 234C of the Act is on wholly
> illegal and untenable grounds and is prayed not to be upheld. _
> 17\. That each ground is independent of and without prejudice to the other
> grounds raised herein."
20
> ITA No.658/Del/2017
> 26\. Ground Nos. 13 and 14 were not pressed by the ld. counsel due to
> smallness of the amount for which ld. DR has no objection. Accordingly, the
> same are dismissed as not pressed. Ground Nos.15 and 16 are either premature
> or consequential in nature. Accordingly, the same are dismissed. Ground
> No.10-17 being general in nature are dismissed.
27\. So far as Ground No.11 to 12 are concerned, they relate to the addition
on account of unbilled revenue written off and security written off of
Rs.1,15,59,310/-
28\. Facts of the case, in brief, are that during the assessment proceedings
the Assessing Officer noted that the assessee has claimed unbilled revenue
written off to the extent of Rs.1,15,59,310/- u/s 36(2)(vii) of the Act. On
being questioned by the Assessing Officer, the assessee replied as under:-
> " In this respect, we would like to submit before your good self that during
> the year under consideration, assessee company written off unbilled revenue
> of Rs. 1,15,59,310/- during the relevant year. This revenue has already
> accrued to the assessee company earlier years, so the same had already been
> offered to taxation in earlier years. So, it is allowable .Further reliance
> is placed on the case of M/s Nortel Networks India Pvt. Ltd. ITA No.
> 1938/Del/2009.
> Relying on the above facts and the case laws, we hereby submit before your
> honour that the assessee case is very much identical to the case Nortel
> Networks India Pvt. Ltd. As mentioned supra that is Assessee Company claimed
> the amount of unbilled revenue written off hence it should be allowed."
29\. However, the Assessing Officer did not accept the submissions made by the
assessee and made addition of Rs.1,15,59,310/-. The assessee approached the
DRP and the DRP restored the issue to the file of the Assessing Officer with
21 ITA No.658/Del/2017 certain directions. Subsequently, the Assessing Officer
passed the order retaining the same addition by observing as under:-
> "6.5 I have considered the submission and accompanying documents. However,
> upon a perusal of the submission of the assessee, it is not clear whether
> the amount actually booked as revenue of Rs. 38.98 Cr. From M/s Rolls Royce
> International Ltd. during F.Y 2011-12 includes the sum of Rs. 1,15,59,310/-
> booked as unbilled-revenue during F.Y. 2010-11. As per directions of DRP,
> the claim of assessee shall be allowed only if a contra entry of
> Rs.1,15,59,310/- is found credited again during the year under
> consideration. Since, the contra reversal entry is allowable subject to the
> same amount being credited during FY 201-12, the claim of the assessee is
> not allowed in the absence of credit amount booked in the accounts. In view
> of this, the amount of Rs. 1,15,59,310/- on account of unbilled revenue
> written off shall be disallowed. Since, I am satisfied that the assessee has
> furnished inaccurate particulars of its income, penalty proceedings under
> section 271(1)(c) are being initiated separately."
30\. Aggrieved with such order of the A.O./TPO/DRP, the assessee is in appeal
before the Tribunal.
31\. The ld. counsel for the assessee submitted that due to certain small
error, the Assessing Officer has repeated the addition, however, the
fundamental principle is same and since the assessee in the preceding year has
offered the amount to taxation and in the current year it has reversed the
same, therefore, this being a contra entry, the addition is uncalled for. He
accordingly submitted that the addition made by the Assessing Officer should
be deleted.
32\. The ld. DR, on the other hand, submitted that the assessee has failed to
substantiate with evidence that the amount booked as revenue of Rs.38.98
crores from M/s Rolls Royce International Ltd. for F.Y. 2011-12 includes the
sum of Rs.1,15,59,310/- booked as unbilled revenue during F.Y. 2010-11. He
submitted  22 ITA No.658/Del/2017 that the assessee has failed to substantiate
the same before the Assessing Officer after the direction of the DRP,
therefore, the order of the Assessing Officer should be upheld and the grounds
raised by the assessee on this issue should be dismissed.
33\. We have considered the rival arguments made by both the sides and perused
the material available on record. We find the Assessing Officer, in the
instant case, made an addition of Rs.1,15,59,310/- on account of unbilled
revenue written off on the ground that the assessee could not explain properly
as to whether the amount actually booked as revenue of Rs.38.98 crore from M/s
Rolls Royce International Ltd. during F.Y. 2011-12 includes the sum of
Rs.1,15,59,310/- booked as unbilled revenue during F.Y. 2010-11. It is the
submission of the ld. counsel for the assessee that due to certain small
arithmetical error there is some minor difference in the figures shown in
2012-13. However, it is his submission that given an opportunity, the assessee
is in a position to reconcile the same before the A.O/TPO that these are mere
contra entries and no addition is called for. Considering the totality of the
facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice, we deem it
proper to restore the issue to the file of the A.O./TPO with a direction to
grant one more opportunity to the assessee to substantiate its case. The
A.O./TPO shall decide the issue as per fact and law, after giving due
opportunity of being heard. We hold and direct accordingly. The grounds raised
by the assessee are accordingly allowed for statistical purposes.  23
ITA No.658/Del/2017
34\. In the result, the appeal filed by the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes.
The decision was pronounced in the open court on 30.10.2019.
