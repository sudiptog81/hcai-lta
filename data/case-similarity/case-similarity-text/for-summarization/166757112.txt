Coram: Honble Shri D.N. Panda, Judicial Member Honble Shri Rakesh Kumar,
Technical Member Final Order No.55721/2013 dated:19.2.2013 Per D.N. Panda:
We do not find any substance in the adjudication order to appreciate whether
scrutiny of the activities carried out by appellant was done to bring the
appellant to the fold of law, even though we tried to repeatedly read pages 90
to 103. Therefore, without wasting time of the Tribunal and without keeping
the matter pending here, we send the matter back to the ld. Adjudicating
Authority to re-examine the allegations in the show cause notice with the
defence reply and the evidence on record to reach to a rational conclusion and
to invoke extended limitation period under proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance
Act, 1994 and also imposition of penalty under Section 78. In deciding this
question, the Commissioner must also give his finding as to whether the Apex
Courts judgements in the cases of Chemphar Drugs & Liniments reported in 1989
(40) ELT 276 (SC), Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company reported in 1995 (78) ELT
401 (SC) and Continental Foundation Joint Venture reported in 2007 (2160 ElT
177 (SC), with regard to interpretation of the expression suppression of
facts in proviso to Section 11 A(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 are
applicable to this case and whether in view of these judgements the longer
limitation period would be applicable and penalty under Section 78 would be
imposable.
11\. There is no finding in the impugned order with regard to Appellants
Appellants service tax liability in respect of IPR Service alleged to have
been received by them from foreign service provider but still the service tax
demand of Rs.4,17,562/- has been confirmed. On this point also, the
Commissioner must give his finding in the de novo proceedings.
defence reply and the evidence on record to reach to a rational conclusion and
pass a reasoned and speaking order. Granting fair opportunity of re-hearing,
the Authorities shall pass appropriate order so that the guidelines issued by
the Apex Court in the case of Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Surat Vs.
Saheli Leasing Industries reported in 2010 (253) ELT 705 (SC) is properly
carried out. For convenience of reading the guidelines issued by the Apex
Court is reproduced below:-
7. These guidelines are only illustrative in nature, not exhaustive and can
further be elaborated looking to the need and requirement of a given case :-
(a) It should always be kept in mind that nothing should be written in the
judgment/order, which may not be germane to the facts of the case; It should
have a co-relation with the applicable law and facts. The ratio decided should
be clearly spelt out from the judgment/order.
(b) After preparing the draft, it is necessary to go through the same to find
out, if anything, essential to be mentioned, has escaped discussion.
(c) The ultimate finished judgment/order should have sustained chronology,
regard being had to the concept that it has readable, continued interest and
one does not feel like parting or leaving it in the midway. To elaborate, it
should have flow and perfect sequence of events, which would continue to
generate interest in the reader.
(d) Appropriate care should be taken not to load it with all legal knowledge
on the subject as citation of too many judgments creates more confusion rather
than clarity. The foremost requirement is that leading judgments should be
mentioned and the evolution that has taken place ever since the same were
pronounced and thereafter, latest judgment, in which all previous judgments
have been considered, should be mentioned. While writing judgment, psychology
of the reader has also to be borne in mind, for the perception on that score
is imperative.
(e) Language should not be rhetoric and should not reflect a contrived effort
on the part of the author.
(f) After arguments are concluded, an endeavour should be made to pronounce
the judgment at the earliest and in any case not beyond a period of three
months. Keeping it pending for long time, sends a wrong signal to the
litigants and the society.
(g) It should be avoided to give instances, which are likely to cause public
agitation or to a particular society. Nothing should be reflected in the same
which may hurt the feelings or emotions of any individual or society.
2\. In the result, both stay application and appeal are disposed remanding the
matter to the ld. Adjudicating Authority.
( D.N. Panda ) Judicial Member ( Rakesh Kumar) Technical Member Ckp.
3\. While I fully agree with the order dictated by ld. Brother in the Open
Court remanding the matter to the Adjudicating Authority for de novo
adjudication, since I am of the view that while ordering remand in this matter
certain points have to be specifically mentioned, I am recording a separate
order.
4\. The appellant are a society registered under Society Registration Act,
1860 and are engaged in organizing various courses in clinical medicine in
collaboration with Cranfield University, U.K. The degree is awarded by
Cranfield University, but the degree is not recognized under the Indian laws.
The department was of the view that this activity of the appellant is covered
by the definition of commercial training or coaching service, as defined
under Section 65(105)(zzc) read with Section 65 (26) and 65 (27) of the
Finance Act, 1994 and, therefore, the amount charged by the appellant for
these courses from the students would attract service tax. On this basis five
show cause notices were issued from time to time for the period from
16.08.2005 to 31.3.2011 which were adjudicated by the Commissioner vide order-
in-original no.1-5/GB/2012 dated 3.1.2012 by which the Commissioner confirmed
the service tax demands totalling Rs.11,09,44,488/- along with interest in
respect of Commercial training or coaching service alleged to have been
provided by the Appellant and besides this, imposed penalties under Section
76, 77 and 78 of the Finance Act, 1994. By the same order, service tax demand
of Rs.4,17,562/- along with interest was also confirmed in respect of IPR
services alleged to have been received by the appellant from foreign service
providers.
5\. One of the plea made by the appellant before the Commissioner, as recorded
at Sl.No.3 of the Summary of submissions in para 19 of the impugned
adjudication order, is that the appellant apart from the courses in
collaboration with Cranfield University, U.K., had also been conducting other
educational courses in affiliation with Guru Jambheshwar University, Hissar;
Dr. MGR Education and Research Institute (Deemed University) and PRIST
University, Thanjavur and these courses result in award of degrees/diploma
which are duly recognized by the University Grant Commission and, therefore,
the appellant go out of the definition of commercial training or coaching
centre, as given under Section 65 (27) and, therefore, the services provided
by them would not taxable. In this regard, the appellant have also cited the
Boards Circular Nod.59/81/2003/ST dated 20.06.2003 wherein it was clarified
that if an institute conducts courses for which degrees issued are recognized
by law and in addition, also provides commercial coaching or training, then
such institute would not be liable to pay any service tax in respect of
commercial coaching or training. Besides this, it was also pleaded before the
Commissioner that extended period under proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance
Act, 1994 is not invokable, as there was absolutely no suppression of facts on
the part of the appellant, more so, as even if the Appellants activity of
conducting courses in clinical medicines in collaboration with Cranfield
University, U.K. is held as taxable, they, being a non-profit society would,
in any case, be liable to pay service tax under Section 65 (105)(zzc) read
with Section 65(26) & 65 (27) of the Finance Act, 1994 only on the basis of
retrospective amendment by Finance Act, 2010 to Section 65 (105)(zzc) by
adding an explanation to this Section w.e.f. 1.7.2003 and thus, the bulk of
the demand is time barred and for the same reason, penalty under Section 78 of
the Finance Act is also not imposable. The points made in the summary of
submissions in para 19 and 24 of the impugned order are reproduced below:-
1. These written submissions are being made in addition to and without
prejudice to the submissions already made in the detailed reply and the oral
submissions made during the personal hearing.
2\. The present demand has been raised under commercial training or coaching
service in respect of educational courses conducted by the notice in
collaboration with M/s. Cranfield University vide Agreement dated 2.3.2006.
The basis for the demand is that the said courses are not recognized by the
Indian Law. Assuming, without admitting that the courses offered by the notice
in collaboration with Cranfield University are not recognized by law, it does
not still lead to a conclusion that the notice is liable commercial training
or coaching service.
3\. It is pertinent to mention that apart from the Cranfield courses, in
question, the notice, from time to time, has been conducting other educational
courses also in affiliation with the following Universities in India:-
A. Guru Jambeshwar University, Hisar B. Dr. M.G.R. Education and Research
Institute(Deemed university ).
C. PRIST University, Thanjavur.
4\. It is submitted that the aforementioned Indian Universities are
universities within the meaning of the UGC Act and are duly recognized by the
UGC. Copies of the degrees and marksheets issued by these Universities in
respect of the students, who successfully completed the courses conducted by
the noitcee, are collectively enclosed as Annexure-I.
5\. The above fact that the courses conducted by the notice in affiliation
with the aforementioned Indian Universities is also not disputed by the
department in the SCNs. In fact, the fee collected by the noticee for the
courses conducted in collaboration with these Indian Universities have been
specifically excluded for the purpose of working out service tax liability.
The SCNs have proposed to demand service tax only the fee collected by the
notice for courses conducted in collaboration with the Cranfield University,
U.K.
6\. In this regard, the Noticee also places reliance on the Circular No.
59/812003  ST dated 20.06.2003 wherein it has been clarified that if an
institute conducts courses for which degrees issued are recognized by law and
in addition also provides commercial coaching or training, then such an
institute is not liable to pay service tax even in respect of the commercial
coaching or training. The relevant portion of the Circular is extracted as
under:-
Whether service tax is leviable on institutes providing commercial coaching
in addition to recognized degree courses: Some institutes like colleges, apart
from imparting education for obtaining recognized
degrees/diploma/certificates, also impart training for competitive e
examinations, various entrance tests etc. It is clarified that by definition,
such institutes or establishments, which issue a certificate, diploma or
degree recognized by law, are outside the purview of commercial training or
coaching institute. Thus, even if such institutes or establishments provide
training for competitive examinations etc., such services rendered would be
outside the scope of service tax.
7\. It is an undisputed fact that the Noticee is an institute conducting
courses for which the degrees are issued by various Indian Universities, duly
recognized by law, it is not liable to pay service tax under commercial
training and coaching service even in respect of courses conducted in
collaboration with Canfield University, UK. The SCNs having accepted that the
courses conducted by the Noticee in affiliation to Indian Universities are
resulting in degrees recognized by law, can not at the same time allege that
the other courses conducted by the Noticee in collaboration with Cranfield
University, UK are liable to service tax under commercial training or
coaching service. Retrospective Amendments made to the definition of taxable
service  No case for invoking extended period of limitation and for imposing
penalties.
8\. It is submitted that in the case of commercial training or coaching
Services, retrospective amendments have been made in the definition of
taxable service with effect from 01.07.2003 by the Finance Act, 2010. The said
retrospective amendment is in the nature of a deeming fiction for the
definition of commercial training or coaching centre.
9\. Prior to this amendment, the Honble CESTAT in various judgments had
decided that an institute or establishment which operates with not for profit
objectives will not come under the definition of commercial training or
coaching institute. The Noticee is a non-profit society established solely
for educational purposes. Thus, the Noticee in any case cannot be said to
covered by the definition of commercial training or coaching centre prior to
the retrospective amendment made by the Finance Act, 2010.
10\. Without prejudice to the other submissions on merits, it is submitted
that service tax under commercial training or coaching centre service can be
said be levied on the Noticee only by way of the retrospective amendment. In
such a scenario, the Noticee can not be said to be guilty of any fraud or
suppression or misrepresentation with intention to evade payment of service
tax. Therefore, the proposal to invoke extended period of limitation is in any
case not sustainable in the present case. Further, the proposal to impose
penalties on the Noticee is also not sustainable for the same reason. In any
case, as there was reasonable cause on the part of the Noticee for not
depositing service tax, if any payable, the provisions of section 80 of the
Finance Act, 1994 would apply in the present case. Hence penalties under
section 76, 77 & 78 of the Finance Act, 1994 are in any case not impossible.
6\. During the period of dispute i.e. during period from 16.8.2005 to
31.3.2011, the definition of commercial training or coaching and commercial
training or coaching centre as given in Finance Act, 1994 is as under:-
65 (26) Commercial training or coaching means any training or coaching
provided by a commercial training or coaching centre. 65(27)Commercial
training or coaching centre means any institute or establishment providing
commercial training or coaching for imparting skill or knowledge or lessons on
any subject or field other than the sports, with or without issuance of a
certificate and includes coaching or tutorial classes but does not include
preschool coaching and training centre or any institute or establishment which
issues any certificate or diploma or degree or any educational qualification
recognized by law for the time being in force.
6.1 Under Section 65(105)(zzc), a taxable service in respect of commercial
training or coaching means any service provided to any person by a commercial
training or coaching centre in relation to commercial training or coaching.
6.2 Only w.e.f. 1.5.11 Section 65(27) was amended and the amended definition
of commercial training or coaching centre is as under:-
Commercial training or coaching centre means any institute or establishment
providing commercial training or coaching for imparting skills or knowledge or
lessons on any subject or field other than the sports, with or without
issuance of a certificate and includes coaching or tutorial classes. 6.3 Thus
w.e.f. 1.5.2011 the expression does not include preschool coaching and
training centre or any institute or establishment which issues any certificate
or diploma or degree or any educational qualification recognized by law for
the time being in force was deleted from the definition of commercial
training or coaching centre. .
7\. Thus, it is clear that during the period of dispute, if an institute
provided commercial coaching or training which resulted in award of a degree
or educational qualification recognized by law for the time being in force,
the same was excluded from the purview of the term commercial training or
coaching centre, even if the institute also provided commercial coaching or
training which resulted in issuance of certificates, degree, etc. not
recognized by law, no service tax could be charged on such commercial coaching
or training. This is what the Board has clarified in its Circular
No.59/81/03/GT dated 20.06.2003, the relevant portion of which is reproduced
below-
Whether service tax is leviable on institutes providing commercial coaching
in addition to recognized degree courses:-
Some institutes like colleges apart from imparting education for obtaining
recognized degree, diploma, certificate, also impart training for competitive
examination, various entrance tests, etc. It is clarified that by definition
such institutes or establishments which issue a certificate, diploma or degree
recognized by law are outside the purview of commercial or coaching centre.
Thus, even if such institutions are establishments provide training for
competitive examinations , etc. such services rendered would be outside the
scope of service tax.
8\. In this case, if in addition to conducting courses of clinical sciences in
collaboration with Cranfield University, U.K. which result in award of degree
by Cranfield University, U.K not recognized in India, the appellant also
conducted courses which resulted in award of degrees or diplomas recognized
under Indian laws, the appellants would be outside the purview of the
definition of commercial training or coaching centre and as such, the
services provided by them would not be taxable.
9\. In this case, as mentioned above, though the appellant have pleaded that
they had been conducting courses in affiliation with Guru Jambeshwar
University, Hisar; Dr. M.G.R. Education and Research Institute(Deemed
university ), PRIST University, Thanjavur and the degree awarded by the above
universities are recognized by UGC and, therefore, the Appellant are not
covered by the definition of commercial training or coaching centre and as
such, no service tax can be demanded from them on the amounts charged by them
from the students for the courses in clinical sciences being organized in
collaboration with Cranfield University, U.K., no finding has been given by
the Commissioner on this plea. In my view, this is the most important point in
this case and in course of de novo proceedings, the Commissioner has to give
his finding on the above plea of the appellant and if it is found that during
the period of dispute, they were also conducting courses which resulted in
award of degrees, diplomas, etc. recognized under the Indian laws, the
appellant would be outside the purview of the definition of commercial
training or coaching centre, as the same stood during the period of dispute,
and no service tax can be charged from them even in respect of the courses
being conducted in collaboration with Cranfield University, U.K.
10\. It is also seen that the appellant have pleaded that soon after entering
into the agreement with Cranfield University in March, 2006 regarding the
courses to be conducted with its collaboration, the appellant vide letter
dated 5.6.2006 had sought clarification from DGST, Mumbai and the appellants
letter was forwarded by DGST to the service tax Commissionerate, Delhi and
Mumbai for the guidance in the matter. There is no finding of the Commissioner
as to whether this plea of the appellant is correct and if so, whether in view
of this, and also in view of the points raised in S.No.8, 9 & 10 of the
Summary of Submissions in para 19 of the impugned order, the Appellant can
be said to have suppressed the relevant information from the department so as
to invoke extended limitation period under proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance
Act, 1994 and also imposition of penalty under Section 78. In deciding this
question, the Commissioner must also give his finding as to whether the Apex
Courts judgements in the cases of Chemphar Drugs & Liniments reported in 1989
(40) ELT 276 (SC), Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company reported in 1995 (78) ELT
401 (SC) and Continental Foundation Joint Venture reported in 2007 (2160 ElT
177 (SC), with regard to interpretation of the expression suppression of
facts in proviso to Section 11 A(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 are
applicable to this case and whether in view of these judgements the longer
limitation period would be applicable and penalty under Section 78 would be
imposable.
11\. There is no finding in the impugned order with regard to Appellants
Appellants service tax liability in respect of IPR Service alleged to have
been received by them from foreign service provider but still the service tax
demand of Rs.4,17,562/- has been confirmed. On this point also, the
Commissioner must give his finding in the de novo proceedings.
12\. In de novo proceedings, the Commissioner, among other issues, must also
specifically deal with the above points and must give his specific findings.

generate interest in the reader.
(d) Appropriate care should be taken not to load it with all legal knowledge
on the subject as citation of too many judgments creates more confusion rather
than clarity. The foremost requirement is that leading judgments should be
mentioned and the evolution that has taken place ever since the same were
pronounced and thereafter, latest judgment, in which all previous judgments
have been considered, should be mentioned. While writing judgment, psychology
of the reader has also to be borne in mind, for the perception on that score
is imperative.
(e) Language should not be rhetoric and should not reflect a contrived effort
on the part of the author.
(f) After arguments are concluded, an endeavour should be made to pronounce
to invoke extended limitation period under proviso to Section 73(1) of Finance
Act, 1994 and also imposition of penalty under Section 78. In deciding this
question, the Commissioner must also give his finding as to whether the Apex
Courts judgements in the cases of Chemphar Drugs & Liniments reported in 1989
(40) ELT 276 (SC), Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company reported in 1995 (78) ELT
401 (SC) and Continental Foundation Joint Venture reported in 2007 (2160 ElT
177 (SC), with regard to interpretation of the expression suppression of
facts in proviso to Section 11 A(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 are
applicable to this case and whether in view of these judgements the longer
limitation period would be applicable and penalty under Section 78 would be
imposable.
11\. There is no finding in the impugned order with regard to Appellants
Appellants service tax liability in respect of IPR Service alleged to have
been received by them from foreign service provider but still the service tax
demand of Rs.4,17,562/- has been confirmed. On this point also, the
Commissioner must give his finding in the de novo proceedings.
