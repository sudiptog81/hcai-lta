                                                  JUDGMENT
[Judgment of the Court was delivered by P.T.ASHA,J.] This Intra-Court appeal
arises out of the order dated 06.08.2018 in W.P.No.2369 of 2016 passed by the
learned Judge of this Court.
2.Brief resume of the events preceeding the filing of the Writ Appeal is
detailed herein helow.
3.The appellant herein had been appointed as a Cook Assistant in the
Government's Nutritious Meal Centre at Government Boys High School,
Nagarasampatti, Kaveripattinam Panchayat Union, Krishnagiri District by the
2nd respondent vide orders dated 23.08.2007 on a consolidated pay of
Rs.1,000/- (One thousand only). The appellant has been rendering blemishless
services in the said post and while so the 1st respondent by order dated
12.09.2012 had directed the 2nd respondent to immediately terminate the
services of nine Cooks and sixteen Cook Assistants which included the
appellant. The said order was also communicated by the 2 nd respondent to the
appellant on 13.09.2012. The appellant herein and the others had challenged
this order by filing Writ Petitions.
http://www.judis.nic.in  3 However, the appellant and the others continued to
discharge their duties in their respective posts without being paid salary.
4.Thereafter the 2nd respondent had issued the order of termination dated
17.12.2015, wherein the 2nd respondent had stated that the order of
termination has been passed on account of the Audit report of the Assistant
Director, Local Fund Audit (Noon Meal Scheme), Dharmapuri, in his proceedings
in Na.Ka.No.1215/2006 dated 25.10.2010 and the proceedings of the 1st
respondent dated 12.09.2012 in Na.Ka.No.13921/2012/X2.
5.Challenging the said order the appellant and similarly placed persons had
filed various Writ Petitions. By an order dated 06.08.2018, this Court was
pleased to dismiss the above Writ Petitions by a common order holding as
follows:
> “4.This Court is of an opinion that when an order of appointment had been
> issued by an incompetent authority, having no jurisdiction and the said
> orders have been sent for the approval of the District collector and the
> District Collector in turn, cancelled the orders of appointment on the
> ground that there is no delegation of power of http://www.judis.nic.in
> authorization issued by the Government, permitting  4 the Block Development
> Officer / The Commissioner, Panchayat Union to issue an order of
> appointment. Thus, the initial appointment of the Writ petitioners was
> irregular and not in accordance with the recruitment rules in force.
> Further, the Block Development Officer / The Commissioner, Panchayat Union
> have not empowered or authorized to issue an order of appointment for the
> post of Cook / Cook Assistant in Panchayat Union or in any other Union.
> 5.This being the legal position, this court is of an opinion that the order
> of appointment issued in favour of the Writ Petitioners, was an illegal one
> and therefore, it is left open to the Writ Petitioners to participate in the
> open competitive process, whenever the recruitment notification is issued.
> However, in respect of the illegal appointment, no relief can be granted and
> accordingly, the orders passed by the respondent is in accordance with law
> and there is no infirmity as such.
6.Accordingly, all the Writ Petitions are devoid of merits and stand
dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.” http://www.judis.nic.in  5
6.Challenging the said order the appellant has preferred the above Writ
Appeal. Meanwhile, one of the petitioners aggrieved by the order detailed
supra had filed an appeal in W.A.No.657 of 2019. The Bench by its order dated
29.03.2019 was pleased to allow the above Writ Appeal holding as follows:
> “6.We find considerable force in the submission made by the Learned Counsel
> for the Appellant that the Block Development Officer was authorized under
> G.O. (Ms) No. 11, Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme (NMP1)
> Department dated 22.01.2007 to notify the vacancies, call for applications,
> conduct interviews and send proposals for appointment of suitable persons to
> the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the District Collector and that the
> Appellant cannot be blamed for that Block Development Officer having issued
> their appointment orders, instead of the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the
> District Collector.
At the same time, when the Block Development Officer is not the competent
authority to issue the appointment order, it would not be appropriate to
direct the reinstatement of the services of the Appellant. The proper
recourse, in such circumstances, would be to direct the Personal Assistant
(NMP) to the District Collector, Krishnagiri to call for the recommendations
made by the Block http://www.judis.nic.in  6 Development Officer for filling
up the posts of Cooks and Noon Meal Assistants (including the Appellant) and
after examining the same, pass reasoned orders thereon in accordance with law
and communicate the decision taken to the concerned parties and file a report
of compliance in that regard before the Registrar (Judicial) of this Court by
30.06.2019. The reinstatement of the Appellant in service would depend upon
the outcome of the orders to be passed by the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the
District Collector, Krishnagiri.
7.In the result, the Writ Appeal is allowed, the order dated 06.08.2018 in
W.P. No. 4845 of 2016 is set aside and the Writ Petition is disposed on the
aforesaid terms. No costs” Considering the fact that the instant appeal also
emanates from the order which is the subject matter of challenge in W.A.No.657
of 2019 the very same order would enure to the present Writ Appeal. The Writ
Appeal is therefore disposed of in terms of the Judgement cited supra.
