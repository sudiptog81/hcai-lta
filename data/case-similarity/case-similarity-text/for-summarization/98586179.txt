questions in the main examination Law Paper -II  : 55 : to an extent of 25
marks under the head "frame proper and necessary issues with the following
pleadings" as not proper. The grievance of the petitioner is that in the
plaint, the provisions of law is not mentioned. In the plaint it is
specifically stated at the top as "plaint". Even in the absence of mentioning
specific provision, it is specified that it is a plaint. Therefore, the non-
mentioning of provision of law in the plaint has not resulted in any injustice
to the petitioner. Secondly, it is contended that in the cause title to the
plaint and the written statement pin code numbers are not mentioned. Again
this is an untenable ground. Thirdly it is contended that in some places it is
mentioned as defendant and in some other places it is mentioned as defendants.
These minor mistakes has not resulted in injustice to the petitioners. It is
not the case of petitioners they are totally misled by these minor mistakes
and for this reason they scored less marks or that they failed.

           These petitions having been heard and reserved for
    orders, this day H.N.Nagamohan Das, J, at Dharwad Bench
    pronounced the following:
                                    ORDER
Petitioners in all these writ petitions are unsuccessful candidates in the
main examination conducted by the respondents for recruitment of Civil Judges.
Respondents are common in all these writ petitions. Different prayers are made
in different writ petitions. The sum and substance of the prayers in all these
writ petitions is as under:
> i) To issue a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents to
> retotal the marks secured by the petitioners;
> ii) To issue a writ in the nature of mandamus to furnish Xerox copies of
> answer scripts written by the petitioners;
> iii) For a writ of mandamus to revalue the answer scripts of the petitioners
> in failed subjects in terms of the representations given by them;
: 37 :
> iv) To quash the entire process of conducting the main written examination
> in so far as petitioners are concerned on the ground that Kannada question
> papers are not furnished.
> v) To quash the main examination of Law Paper-II under the heading "Frame
> proper and necessary issues with the following pleadings" assigned 25 marks
> and to direct to issue fresh question paper to that extent.
2\. Respondents issued notification on 6.8.2011 inviting applications from
eligible candidates to fill 152 posts of Civil Judges. This notification
further specifies that there will be a preliminary examination followed by
main examination and thereafter viva-voce. Petitioners and others submitted
their applications. On processing the applications intimation was sent to the
petitioners and others to appear for preliminary examination on 8.12.2012.
Petitioners are successful in the preliminary examination. Thereafter
respondents issued intimation calling upon the petitioners and others to
appear for  : 38 : the main examination on 13th and 14th of April, 2013.
Accordingly, the petitioners and others appeared for the main examination.
After valuing the answer scripts, the respondents notified the eligibility
list for viva-voce in their website on 10.06.2013. To the shock and surprise
of the petitioners it was found that they have failed in some of the subjects.
In the circumstances, petitioners approached the respondents for retotalling
of the marks, to furnish copies of answer scripts and for revaluation. Since
the respondents refused to entertain the request of the petitioners, they are
before this court seeking the above mentioned reliefs.
3\. Respondent - High Court of Karnataka filed their statement of objections
interalia contending that they have conducted the preliminary examination and
the main examination strictly in terms of provisions of Karnataka Judicial
Services (Recruitment)(Amended)Rules,2011 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Rules'). Even the valuation and totalling of answer  : 39 : scripts of
petitioners and others are strictly done in terms of the Rules and there are
no lapses or illegalities. The Rules do not provide for retotalling, providing
xerox copies of answer scripts and revaluation. The setting up of question
papers is in accordance with the Rules and there are no illegalities.
Furnishing of question papers in Kannada language is not mandatory and the
same has not resulted in any inconvenience or loss to the petitioners.
Therefore the respondents pray for dismissal of writ petitions.
4\. Heard arguments on both the side and perused the entire writ papers.
On Prayer (i)
5\. On 25.07.2013 learned counsel for the respondent - Registrar General made
a submission and this court passed an order as under:
Sri D.M.Nanjunda Reddy, learned senior counsel for the respondent Registrar
General submits that in the event of any of  : 40 : the petitioners applying
for re-totaling, then they will re-total their answer sheets and issue
necessary endorsement. Submission of the learned senior counsel is placed on
record. Petitioners who are interested may apply for re-totalling to the
respondent Registrar General. The Registrar General is hereby directed to
consider the applications, re-total the answer sheets of the respective
petitioners and issue endorsement to that effect.
6\. In terms of the above order some of the petitioners have submitted their
applications for retotaling their answer scripts. Accordingly, the respondent
retotalled the marks secured by the applicants and issued necessary
endorsements. If any of the petitioners have not applied for retotaling they
are entitled to apply. Even if the respondents have rejected the applications
for retotaling, such applicants are also entitled to apply for retotaling. In
that event the respondent Registrar General to retotal the answer scripts and
issue necessary endorsement. In view of this development prayer no.(i) in the
writ petitions no longer need be addressed.
: 41 :
On Prayer (ii)
7\. Some of the petitioners have applied for the Xerox copies of answer
scripts written by them and the respondents issued endorsements rejecting the
same. Some of the petitioners have filed appeals against the endorsement
before the first appellate authority and they are pending consideration.
Petitioners are seeking Xerox copies of the answer scripts under the
provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005. The Supreme Court in The
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Shaunak H.Satya (AIR 2011 SC
3336) held as under:
The information to which RTI Act applies falls into two categories, namely,
(i) information which promotes transparency and accountability in the working
of every public authority, disclosure of which helps in containing or
discouraging corruption, enumerated in clauses (b) and (c) of section 4(1) of
RTI Act; and (ii) other information held by public authorities not falling
under section 4(1)(b) and (c) of RTI Act. In regard to information falling
under the first category, the public authorities owe a duty to disseminate the
information widely suo moto to the public so as to make it easily accessible
to the public. In regard to information enumerated or required to be
enumerated under section 4(1)(b) and (c) of RTI Act, necessarily and
naturally, the competent authorities under the RTI Act, will have to act in a
pro- active manner so as to ensure accountability and ensure that the fight
against corruption goes on relentlessly. But in regard to other  : 42 :
information which do not fall under Section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act, there
is a need to proceed with circumspection as it is necessary to find out
whether they are exempted from disclosure. One of the objects of democracy is
to bring about transparency of information to contain corruption and bring
about accountability. But achieving this object does not mean that other
equally important public interests including efficient functioning of the
governments and public authorities, optimum use of limited fiscal resources
and preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information, etc. are to be
ignored or sacrificed. The object of RTI Act is to harmonize the conflicting
public interests, that is, ensuring transparency to bring in accountability
and containing corruption on the one hand, and at the same time ensure that
the revelation of information, in actual practice, does not harm or adversely
affect other public interests which include efficient functioning of the
governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and preservation of
confidentiality of sensitive information, on the other hand. While sections 3
and 4 seek to achieve the first objective, sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 seek to
achieve the second objective. Therefore when section 8 exempts certain
information from being disclosed, it should not be considered to be a fetter
on the right to information, but as an equally important provision protecting
other public interests essential for the fulfilment and preservation of
democratic ideals. Therefore in dealing with information not falling under
section 4(1)(b) and (c), the competent authorities under the RTI Act will not
read the exemptions in section 8 in a restrictive manner but in a practical
manner so that the other public interests are preserved and the RTI Act
attains a fine balance between its goal of attaining transparency of
information and safeguarding the other public interests.
8\. In view of the law declared by the Apex Court in the judgment referred to
supra, it is obligatory on the part of the  : 43 : respondents to provide
information under Section 4(1) (b) and (c) of RTI Act. Further Section 8 of
the Act exempted certain categories of information from disclosure. It is not
shown to me under which category the respondents are exempted from disclosure
of the information sought for by the petitioners. If for any reason, the
respondents have refused to furnish the information sought for by the
petitioners, then the petitioners are entitled to work out their remedy under
the provisions of the Right to Information Act. Indeed, in the present case
some of the petitioners who are aggrieved by the refusal endorsements issued
by the respondents have filed first appeals and they are pending
consideration. The first appellate authority to consider the appeals filed by
some of the petitioners in terms of the Right to Information Act.
9\. Learned Senior Counsel Sri D.M.Nanjunda Reddy for respondent submits that
they will show the answer scripts to the advocates for petitioners and not to
the petitioners. Some of the  : 44 : petitioners are willing and some of the
petitioners are not willing to the proposal made by the senior counsel for
respondent. Such of the petitioners who are willing may ask their advocates to
approach the respondent - Registrar General of High Court and in that event
the answer scripts of the petitioners be shown to their respective advocates.
On Prayer (iii)
10\. It is necessary to notice the law laid down by the Supreme Court on the
question of revaluation of the answer scripts. The Supreme Court in
Maharashtra State board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education and
another vs. Paritosh Bhupesh Kumar Sheth and others (1984) 4 SCC 27 held as
under:
26\. "We are unable to agree with the further reason stated by the High Court
that since "every student has a right to receive fair play in examination and
get appropriate marks matching his performance" it will be a denial of the
right to such fair play if there is to be a prohibition on the right to demand
revaluation  : 45 : and unless a right to revaluation is recognised and
permitted there is an infringement of rules of fair play. What constitutes
fair play depends upon the facts and circumstances relating to each particular
given situation. If it is found that every possible precaution has been taken
and all necessary safeguards provided to ensure that the answer books
inclusive of supplements are kept in safe custody so as to eliminate the
danger of their being tampered with and that the evaluation is done by the
examiners applying uniform standards with checks and cross-checks at different
stages and that measures for detection of malpractice, etc. have also been
effectively adopted, in such cases it will not be correct on the part of the
Courts to strike down the provision prohibiting revaluation on the ground that
it violates the rules of fair play. It is unfortunate that the High Court has
not set out in detail in either of its two judgments the elaborate procedure
laid down and followed by the Board and the Divisional Boards relating to the
conduct of the examinations, the evaluation of the answer books and the
compilation and announcement of the results. From the affidavit filed on
behalf of the Board in the High Court, it is seen that from the initial stage
of the issuance of the hall tickets to the intending candidates right upto the
announcement of the results, a well-organised system of  : 46 : verification,
checks and counter-checks has been evolved by the Board and every step has
been taken to eliminate the possibility of human error on the part of the
examiners and malpractices on the part of examinees as well as the examiners
in an effective fashion. The examination centres of the Board are spread all
over the length and breadth of each Division and arrangements are made for
vigilant supervision under the overall supervision of a Deputy Chief Conductor
in charge of every sub-centre and at the conclusion of the time set for
examination in each paper including the main answer book all the answer books
and the supplements have to be tied up by the candidate securely and returned
to the Supervisor. But before they are returned to the Supervisor, each
candidate has to write out the title page of main answer books in the cages
provided for the said particulars, the number of supplements attached to the
main answer book. The, Supervisor is enjoined to verify whether the number so
written tallies with the actual number of supplements, handed over by the
candidate together with his main answer book. After the return of all the
answer books to the Deputy Chief Conductor, a tally is taken of the answer
books including supplements used by the candidates by the Stationery
Supervisor who is posted by the Board at each sub-centre. This enables the
supervisory staff at a  : 47 : sub-centre to verify and ensure that all answer
books and supplements issued to the candidates have been turned in and
received by the supervisory staff. At this stage of checking and double-
checking, if any seat number has been duplicated on the answer books by
mistake or by way of deliberate malpractice it can be easily detected and
corrective measures taken by the Deputy Chief Conductor or the Chief
Conductor. The answer books are then sent by the Deputy Chief Conductor to the
Chief Conductor in charge of the main centre. He sorts out the answer books
according to the instructions issued by the Board and sends them to the
examiners whose names had been furnished in advance except in the case of the
science subjects, namely, "mathematics and statistics, physics, chemistry and
biology". The answer books in the science subjects are forwarded by the Chief
Conductor under proper guard to camps in Pune already notified to the Chief
Conductors. The further procedure followed in relation to the valuation of the
answer books has been explained in paragraphs 22 to 26 of the counter
affidavit dated 10th July 1980 filed in the High Court by the Joint Secretary
to the Pune Divisional Board of Secondary Education. We do not consider it
necessary to burden this judgment with a recapitulation of all the details
furnished in those paragraphs, and it would suffice to state  : 48 : that the
procedure evolved by the Board for ensuring fairness and accuracy in
evaluation of the answer books has made the system as fool proof as can be
possible and it meets with our entire satisfaction and approval. Viewed
against this background, we do not find it possible to agree with the views
expressed by the High Court that the denial of the right to demand a
revaluation constitutes a denial of fair play and is unreasonable. The Board
is a very responsible body. The candidates have taken the examination with
full awareness of the provisions contained in the Regulations and in the
declaration made in the form of application for admission to the examination
they have solemnly stated that they fully agree to abide by the regulations
issued by the Board. In the circumstances, when we find that all safeguards
against errors and malpractices have been provided for, there cannot be said
to be any denial of fair play to the examinees by reason of the prohibition
against asking for revaluation.
29\. Far from advancing public interest and fair play to the other candidates
in general, any such interpretation of the legal position would be wholly
defeasive of the same. As has been repeatedly pointed out by this court, the
Court should be extremely reluctant to substitute its own views as to what is
wise, prudent and proper in relation to academic matters in preference  : 49 :
to those formulated by professional men possessing technical expertise and
rich experience of actual day-to-day working of educational institutions and
the departments controlling them. It will be wholly wrong for the court to
make a pedantic and purely idealistic approach to the problems of this nature,
isolated from the actual realities and grass root problems involved in the
working of the system and unmindful of the consequences which would emanate if
a purely idealistic view as opposed to a pragmatic one were to be propounded.
It is equally important that the Court should also, as far as possible, avoid
any decision or interpretation of a statutory provision, rule or bye-law which
would bring about the result of rendering the system unworkable in practice.
It is unfortunate that this principle has not been adequately kept in mind by
the High Court while deciding the instant case.
In Pramod Kumar Srivastava vs. Chairman, Board Public Service Commission,
Patna (2004) 6 SCC 714 the Supreme Court held that "in the absence of any
provisions for revaluation of answer books in the relevant rules no candidate
in a examination  : 50 : has got any right whatsoever to claim or ask for
revaluation of his marks"
In Board of Secondary Education vs. Pravas Ranjan Panda and another (2004) 13
SCC 383, it is held as under:
The High court though observed that the writ petitioner who has taken the
examination is hardly a competent person to assess his own merit and on that
basis claim for re-evaluation of papers, but issued the aforesaid direction in
order to eliminate the possibility of injustice on account of marginal
variation in marks. It is an admitted position that the regulations of the
Board of Secondary Education, Orissa do not make any provision for re-
evaluation of answer-books of the students. The question whether in absence of
any provision to that effect an examinee is entitled to ask for re-evaluation
of his answer books has been examined by us in Pramod Kumar Srivastava v.
Chairman, Bihar Public Service Commission decided on 6.8.2004. It has been
held therein that in absence of rules providing for re-evaluation of answer
books, no such direction can be issued. It has been further held that in
absence of clear rules on the subject, a direction for re-evaluation of the
answer-books, may throw many problems and in the larger public interest such a
direction must  : 51 : be avoided. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the
impugned order of the High Court directing for re-evaluation of the answer-
books of all the examinees securing 90% or above marks is clearly
unsustainable in law and must be set aside.
11\. Keeping in view the law declared by the Apex court in the decisions
referred to supra, it is necessary to examine the fact situation in the
present case. The competitive examination for recruitment of Civil Judges is
governed by the Karnataka Judicial Service (Recruitment)(Amended) Rules, 2011.
A perusal of these Rules do not provide for revaluation of the answer scripts.
As a matter of right the petitioners are not entitled to seek revaluation of
their answer scripts. In the writ petitions the petitioners have not alleged
any malafides, illegality or irregularity in the matter of valuation of the
answer scripts. Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that petitioners are
not entitled for prayer-(iii).
: 52 :
On Prayer (iv)
12\. It is not in dispute that competitive examination for recruitment of
Civil Judges is governed by the Rules. A perusal of these Rules do not specify
for providing question papers in Kannada. The notification dated 6.8.2011
issued by the respondents inviting applications from eligible candidates for
recruitment to the vacant posts of Civil Judges specifies that such of those
candidates who desire to answer in Kannada may do so in the preliminary
examination and main examination. In the instant case, the aggrieved
petitioners have answered the questions in the main examination in Kannada.
Aggrieved petitioners have passed in certain subjects and failed in certain
subjects. Further in the main examination there is one translation paper and
the candidates will be required to translate from English to Kannada and
Kannada to English. Accordingly the aggrieved petitioners have answered the
translation paper.  : 53 : Therefore, the aggrieved petitioners are not put to
any inconvenience or loss for not providing the question papers in Kannada. It
is not shown to me as to how the aggrieved petitioners are put to
inconvenience and loss for not giving the question papers in Kannada.
13\. It is contended that in all the previous examinations conducted by the
respondents they have provided question papers both in English and Kannada.
Even in the preliminary examination in respect of the present recruitment,
question papers in English and Kannada was provided. But the respondents have
not provided the question papers in Kannada in the main examination. There is
a practice for a long length of time providing question papers both in English
and Kannada. Thus the petitioners legitimately expected that they will be
provided with the question papers in Kannada even in the main examination. As
already pointed out the aggrieved petitioners  : 54 : have understood the
question in English and have answered in Kannada. In some of the papers
answered in Kannada aggrieved petitioners have passed and in some of the
papers they are failed. Now that the main examination is completed, valuation
of answer scripts is completed and the viva-voce of successful candidates in
the main examination is over and at this length of time, I am of the
considered opinion that on this ground the entire process of examination
cannot be annulled. The Doctrine of legitimate expectancy shall yield to
equity and public interest. Though the Rules do not provide for furnishing
Kannada question papers, there was a practice providing Kannada question
papers. In future examinations, the respondents shall provide question papers
both in Kannada and English.
On Prayer(v)
14\. Petitioners in W.P.No.18124/2013 alone urged that the framing of
questions in the main examination Law Paper -II  : 55 : to an extent of 25
marks under the head "frame proper and necessary issues with the following
pleadings" as not proper. The grievance of the petitioner is that in the
plaint, the provisions of law is not mentioned. In the plaint it is
specifically stated at the top as "plaint". Even in the absence of mentioning
specific provision, it is specified that it is a plaint. Therefore, the non-
mentioning of provision of law in the plaint has not resulted in any injustice
to the petitioner. Secondly, it is contended that in the cause title to the
plaint and the written statement pin code numbers are not mentioned. Again
this is an untenable ground. Thirdly it is contended that in some places it is
mentioned as defendant and in some other places it is mentioned as defendants.
These minor mistakes has not resulted in injustice to the petitioners. It is
not the case of petitioners they are totally misled by these minor mistakes
and for this reason they scored less marks or that they failed.
: 56 :
For the reasons stated above and with the above observation the writ petitions
are hereby dismissed.

questions in the main examination Law Paper -II  : 55 : to an extent of 25
marks under the head "frame proper and necessary issues with the following
pleadings" as not proper. The grievance of the petitioner is that in the
plaint, the provisions of law is not mentioned. In the plaint it is
specifically stated at the top as "plaint". Even in the absence of mentioning
specific provision, it is specified that it is a plaint. Therefore, the non-
mentioning of provision of law in the plaint has not resulted in any injustice
to the petitioner. Secondly, it is contended that in the cause title to the
plaint and the written statement pin code numbers are not mentioned. Again
this is an untenable ground. Thirdly it is contended that in some places it is
mentioned as defendant and in some other places it is mentioned as defendants.
These minor mistakes has not resulted in injustice to the petitioners. It is
not the case of petitioners they are totally misled by these minor mistakes
and for this reason they scored less marks or that they failed.
