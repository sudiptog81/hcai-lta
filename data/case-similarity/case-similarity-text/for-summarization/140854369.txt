    (i) Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:­
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. SITA RAM ORS/ DD NO.14A/U.S. 79 of Trade & Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958/ ACQUITTED/08.6.2009 /Page 1 of 5 k
1\. Five accused namely Sita Ram, Ashok Soni, Satish Kumar, Pradeep Malhotra &
Jitender Shah were sent up for trial in the present case.
2\. Brief facts of the case are that M/s. Jai Industries filed a criminal
complaint in the Court for the offences u/s. 78 & 79 of Trade & Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958, as also u/s. 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957. In the said
complaint it was alleged that M/s. Jai Industries, a partnership concern was
manufacturing locks of various kinds and ignition starting device for motor
engine, meters, cutout, signaling apparatus, indicating lights etc. for use in
automobiles. The said company claimed to own trademark "Jay" and it was
alleged that some persons were infringing the trademark and copyright work on
the artistic work of the complainant. On this complaint, my Ld. Predecessor
Court issued a search warrant and, pursuant to the said search warrant, on
06.3.1991, a raid was conducted at premises no. 1/7, Nicholson Road, Ground
Floor, Shop No.7, Kashmere Gate, Delhi. The said shop belonged to accused
Ashok Soni and from the said shop allegedly certain infringed articles were
recovered. Thereafter, shop of accused Sitaram i.e. shop no.924/E, Tilak Gali,
Kashmere Gate, Delhi, was raided from where also infringed articles were
recovered. Thereafter, the search warrants were extended and from the shop of
remaining three accused at Mumbai, various infringed articles were allegedly
recovered.
3\. On completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed in the Court and my
Ld. Predecessor on 19.2.2001 framed a notice u/s.251 Cr.PC against all five
accused for offences u/s. 79 of Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. In
support of its case, from the year 2001 till the year 2009, prosecution
examined only three witnesses.
4\. PW1 R.R. Hingorani, who allegedly took part in the raid, was partly
examined in chief and his further examination in chief was deferred way back
in 20.10.2003, and thereafter despite various opportunities this witness was
not examined by the prosecution. Therefore, the testimony of this witness
cannot be read in evidence since his testimony was not complete nor he was
tendered for cross examination.
5\. PW2 HC Joginder Singh deposed that on 28.5.1991, he joined the
investigation of the present case alongwith SI Ranbir Singh and P.R. Chaudhary
and shop no. 924­B, Gali Tilak, Kashmere Gate, belonging to Sitaram and shop
belonging to Ashok in Tilak Gali, Kashmere Gate were raided from where
switches of Mahindra Jeep were recovered. The case property was seized vide
JUDGMENT/STATE VS. SITA RAM ORS/ DD NO.14A/U.S. 79 of Trade & Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958/ ACQUITTED/08.6.2009 /Page 2 of 5 k seizure memo Ex. PW2/A and
PW2/B respectively. This witness neither identified the two accused Sitaram
and Ashok Soni in the Court, nor the case property allegedly recovered from
these two accused was shown to this witness. Rather this witness specifically
stated that he cannot identify either of the two accused Sitaram and Ashok.
Therefore, testimony of this witness is of no help to the case of prosecution
as neither the case property was identified nor the accused was identified.
6\. During cross examination, this witness PW2 specifically stated that the
two recovery memos Ex. PW2/A and PW2/B contains overwriting i.e. name of one
witness Ct. Baljeet which was written on the recovery memo was struck off and
at the place of name of Ct. Baljeet, name of this witness HC Joginder was
added. This cast serious doubt about the case of prosecution. No reason is
forthcoming as to why this cutting is there. This witness also specifically
stated in his cross examination that he did not accompany the IO SI Ranbir
Singh and P.R. Chaudhary anywhere else in connection with the raids in this
case. The witness also stated that he does not know whether any adjoining
shopkeepers were requested by the IO to become witness. There is thus non
compliance of section 100 of Cr.PC.which in subsection (4) specifically
provides, that whenever any search or seizure is to be effected, the IO must
make effort to join local respectable inhabitant of the locality where the
search is to be conducted, to become witness. In the present case, there is no
local respectable inhabitant of the locality who was so requested or joined.
The provisions of section 100 Cr.PC are mandatory since the word used in
subsection (4) is "shall". One can understand a situation where such local
respectable inhabitant were so requested but they did not join. But in the
present case, there is not even effort made to join two or more independent
and respectable inhabitant of the locality which was searched. The witnesses
from other locality can be joined only if no such inhabitant of the said
locality is available or is willing to be witness to the search.
7\. Lastly, PW3 SI Ranbir Singh was the IO who deposed that on 28.5.1991, he
alongwith Ct. Jitender and Devende Singh Chaudhary and one Mr. Pradeep Gupta
and Hingorani effected recoveries from the shop of Sitaram and from the shop
of Ashok Soni. The witness also deposed that after extension of search
warrants, recoveries from the remaining three accused from there respective
shop at Bombay were also effected which were taken into police possession
after sealing the same vide seizure memos Ex. PW2/A, PW2/B, PW1/A, PW2/D1 and
PW3/A respectively from the shop of accused Sitaram, Ashok Soni, Pradeep
Malhotra, Satish Kumar and Jitender Shah. JUDGMENT/STATE VS. SITA RAM ORS/ DD

/Page 3 of 5 k
8\. During examination of this witness, the case property allegedly so
recovered was produced in parts. On 06.12.2004, only one bundle containing
empty boxes of ignition switches without any switches inside them was produced
and that too without any seal. Subsequently, on 18.5.1999, two unsealed gunny
bags which were also torn and having holes in the gunny bags was produced. The
witness specifically stated that the contents of one bag which are empty boxes
of 'Jay' ignition starter switch were not case property of this case and not
related to this case. Second gunny bag was also containing ignition starter
switches which was allegedly recovered from accused Ashok Soni and exhibited
as Ex. P1. Four ignition switches only were stated to be recovered from the
accused Sitaram, but they were not separately produced and were mixed up with
the entire case property. Therefore, there was no distinctive mark to separate
the case property recovered from the accused. One more unsealed bag was
produced on 18.5.2009 containing some small packaging card boxes of
ignition/starter switches, but the bags were unsealed. This bag was allegedly
containing case property recovered from accused Jitender Shah. Remaining case
property was produced on the next date of hearing on 19.5.2009 which again
were already torn. Out of which one bag was unsealed and found containing case
property recovered from accused Pradeep Malhotra and the last bag which was
produced was having sealed containing case property recovered from accused
Satish.
9\. During cross examination, this witness also admitted cutting and
overwriting on Ex. PW2/A and PW2/B which are seizure memos. This witness
specifically stated that Ct. Joginder remained associated with the
Investigating Officer in the recovery effected from Bombay as well. Whereas,
Ct. Joginder, PW2 denies any such recovery from Bombay. No arrival or
departure entry/DD entries either at Delhi or Bombay is proved in this case.
No witnesses from local police station of Bombay were even joined. No local
inhabitant from the place of recovery at Bombay were joined.
10\. In view of the above discussion, prosecution has miserably failed to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused persons. No other
witness was examined despite the case pending since 1991 and charges framed in
the year 2001. Case property was not kept in sealed condition till it was
proved in evidence. No respectable inhabitant from locality are joined. No
departure or arrival entry is proved. Even, PW2 & PW3 have contradicted
themselves regarding recovery from Bombay as to the fact whether PW2 was a
witness or not. On Ex. PW2/A and PW2/B i.e. recovery from Delhi, there is
overwriting and change of name in the PW2 by cutting the JUDGMENT/STATE VS.

Jitender Shah were sent up for trial in the present case.

complaint in the Court for the offences u/s. 78 & 79 of Trade & Merchandise

manufacturing locks of various kinds and ignition starting device for motor
engine, meters, cutout, signaling apparatus, indicating lights etc. for use in
automobiles. The said company claimed to own trademark "Jay" and it was
alleged that some persons were infringing the trademark and copyright work on
the artistic work of the complainant. On this complaint, my Ld. Predecessor
Court issued a search warrant and, pursuant to the said search warrant, on
06.3.1991, a raid was conducted at premises no. 1/7, Nicholson Road, Ground
Floor, Shop No.7, Kashmere Gate, Delhi. The said shop belonged to accused

themselves regarding recovery from Bombay as to the fact whether PW2 was a
witness or not. On Ex. PW2/A and PW2/B i.e. recovery from Delhi, there is
overwriting and change of name in the PW2 by cutting the JUDGMENT/STATE VS.

ACQUITTED/08.6.2009 /Page 4 of 5 k name of Ct. Baljeet for which no
explanation has been put­forth. In such circumstances, reasonable doubt about
the genuineness of the case of prosecution crops us and benefit of doubt ought
to go to the accused. It may be mentioned here that burden of proof in a
criminal case is on the prosecution and it is for the prosecution to prove its
case and it is not for an accused to prove his defence. Accordingly, all the
five accused namely Sita Ram, Ashok Soni, Satish Kumar, Pradeep Malhotra &
Jitender Shah are acquitted of the charges. Their surety bonds and personal
bonds, if any stands cancelled. Sureties are discharged. Endorsement, if any
on the documents of sureties stand cancelled. File be consigned to Record
