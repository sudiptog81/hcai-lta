    ORDER
1\. The state approaches this court u/s 397, 399 of Cr.PC challenging the
order dated 21.01.2017 in FIR no. 493/07 on the files of Ld ACMM, Shahdara
District, whereby the accused therein (respondents herein) were discharged by
the court below for the offences u/s 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 and also
for the offences U/s 420 r/w 34 of IPC.
2\. The grounds of revision are that the court below had passed a perverse,
imperfect and unjustified order contrary to the law and the rulings laid down
in U.K. Limited vs. Samrat Pharmaceuticals AIR 1984 Del. 265. Another case law
infirmity, illegality or impropriety. Hence the following :
ORDER Revision petition stands rejected. The order 02.01.2017 in FIR No.
493/2007 PS Anand Vihar on the files of Ld. ACMM, Shahdara District is hereby
affirmed. The trial court records along with a copy of this record be sent

Kharbanda Page 4/5 the case, if the parties do not put up their claim within
30 days, the goods seized in this case are directed to be destroyed as of no
value and Ld. ACMM be intimated of such action taken by the investigation. The

in U.K. Limited vs. Samrat Pharmaceuticals AIR 1984 Del. 265. Another case law
is also urged in the grounds titled as Rajesh Garg vs. Tata Tea Limited DD
02.01.2017 to urge that mere intention to deceive the public and attempted to
drive economic benefit on false representation, sec. 420 of IPC could be
invoked by selling the spurious products. It is also urged that the material
available on record would constitute the offences mentioned in the charge-
sheet. Therefore, the state prays for setting aside the impugned order.
Cr. Rev. No. 52/17 State vs. Sudhir Kharbanda Page 1/5
3\. Notices were ordered on this revision and the respondents appeared through
their counsel. Trial court records are secured. Perused the same. After
hearing the arguments on both the sides, the only point that arises for
consideration in this revision is "Whether the impugned order of the court
below suffers from any illegality, impropriety and thus not correct in the
circumstances of the case or not?"
4\. The Ld. Addl. P.P. submits that the police have received a complaint from
the authorised attorney of M/s Goetze (GTP) Products on 10.08.2007. The
attorney is M/s Agency for Intelligence Development. It complained that M/s T
& N Trademarks Ltd. situate at Manchester (UK) is the owner of the trademark
"Goetze" for certain products like gaskets, seals, piston rings, machine parts
of rubber and machine tools. This attorney further complained that certain
spurious products infringing the original products are being sold which is an
infringement of the Trademark/Copyright Act causing loss of revenue to the
government. The accused involved are shown to be as follows in their original
complaint dt. 16.08.2007. The page ended there. In the second page, no details
of such persons involving in the infringement of the trademark are mentioned
and described by the complainant. This is gathered from the records of the
trial court. However, the investigating agency namely PS Anand Vihar with the
assistance of the complainant Basant Kumar Lal had raided and recovered
certain material from the respondents herein and thereafter the charge sheet
is filed.
5\. The Ld. Addl. P.P. would urge that from the material gathered, clear
offences u/s 63 of the Copyright Act and also the Cr. Rev. No. 52/17 State vs.
Sudhir Kharbanda Page 2/5 offences u/s 420 of IPC are made out and therefore
he urges that relying on the case law mentioned in the revision, the impugned
order be set aside.
6\. On the other hand, the Ld. Counsel for the respondents submit that there
is no offence of any sort mentioned in the charge sheet. He had relied on the
case law of Krishika Lulla vs. Shyam Vidhal Rao 2016 (I) JCC 229 of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court to drive home the point that the copyright is a
statutory right protected by the Act. This was concerning a cinematography
titled "Desi Boys" wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court found that there is no
copyright in the title and thus no infringement. Further reliance is placed on
Rahul Mehta vs. State of Haryana MANU/PH/1889/2009 to press the point that the
registration of a copyright is a pre-condition for prosecution.
7\. To answer the point for consideration, it is seen from the impugned order
that the Ld. ACMM had noted that the copyright is not registered. Allegations
of sec. 420 of IPC are not substantiated as there is no examination of victim
of the offence and thus discharged the accused. Whether these observations are
correct or not is to be examined. Admittedly, there is none who felt cheated
nor complained of having purchased the spurious product sold by the accused
which caused wrongful loss upon the representation of the accused which they
believed to be true. Therefore, the offence u/s 420 of IPC does not come into
picture at all.
8\. The other offence complained in the charge sheet is u/s 63 of the
Copyright Act which talks of a infringement of a copyright. Section 14 of the
Act describes the meaning of copyright. It only Cr. Rev. No. 52/17 State vs.
Sudhir Kharbanda Page 3/5 deals with the original literary, dramatic, musical
and artistic works or cinematography works or sound recordings. It also deals
with the computer programmes as per the amendment to the Act in the year
2000\. It also deals with any designs in the copyright. Sec. 15 (1) of the Act
is clear that copyright shall not subsist under this Act in any design which
is registered under the Designs Act. "The Designs Act" words are now
substituted by the words 'Indian Patents'.
9\. After careful examination of the material on record, if at all there were
to be any offences, the same would have been urged under the relevant Acts
namely the Trademarks Act or the Indian Patents Act. The mere possession of
spurious goods with the accused cannot be held as an offence u/s 63 of the
Copyright Act for the simple reason that there is no subsisting copyright and
the complainant had misled the police by invoking the Copyright/Trademarks Act
in his complaint. Further the complainant had never disclosed the names of the
offenders in his very complaint and left blank the addresses of such persons
in the complaint dated 16.08.2007 addressed to the DCP (East District) Delhi.
In the above context of the facts of the case, none of the rulings urged by
the Ld. Addl. P.P and the Ld. Counsel for the respondents are applicable.
Suffice it to say that the order of the Ld. ACMM does not suffer from any
infirmity, illegality or impropriety. Hence the following :
ORDER Revision petition stands rejected. The order 02.01.2017 in FIR No.
493/2007 PS Anand Vihar on the files of Ld. ACMM, Shahdara District is hereby
affirmed. The trial court records along with a copy of this record be sent
