Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal - Bangalore
Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. And Anr. vs Cce on 16 February, 2005
Bench: S Peeran, J T T.K.
ORDER T.K. Jayaraman, Member (T)
1\. Two appeals have been filed in respect of Order in Original No. 21/1999
dated 1.10.1999 passed by the Commissioner (Adjudication).
2\. One appeal is filed by the Party M/s. ABB Ltd., Bangalore and the other
appeal by the Revenue. The brief facts of the case are as follows:
3\. On the basis of investigation, Revenue proceeded against M/s. ABB Ltd. for
evasion of Central Excise duty by wrongly availing exemption on the software
for Distributed Control System (DCS) and by mis-declaring such software as
'Computer Software'. It was further alleged that M/s. ABB evaded duty by not
including Factory Acceptance Test charges in the assessable value of the DCS
manufactured and removed by them and by not including Systems Engineering
charges in the assessable value of DCS manufactured and cleared by them. The
period involved is from 1.4.1994 to 1.6.1998. The Adjudicating Authority
confirmed a demand of Rs. 3,37,85.494/- being the duty on the clearances of
software for DCS under Rule 9(1) of the Central Excise Rules read with Proviso
to Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act 1944. Duty was also demanded by
including the Factory Acceptance Test charges and Systems Engineering charges.
list, they had given the technical literature to the Department. The
Department did not raise any objection at that time because the department was
also having the same view. The genesis of the Show Cause Notice itself is on
account of the introduction of the definition of Computer Software in the
Customs Notification. In such circumstances, a charge of mis-declaration by
M/s. ABB has no force.
9\. Summing up, we hold that as far as the Central Excise Notification No.
48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994 is concerned, all Software are eligible for exemption
and one cannot import the definition of Computer Software in the Customs
Notification to deny the benefit of exemption to DCS software. The charge of
mis-declaration also cannot be sustained. As regards non-inclusion of Systems
Engineering charges, there is force in the appellants' contention that such
activity has been undertaken at site in connection with the layout of the DCS
and is in no way connected with the manufacture of the DCS. In view of this,
we allow the party's appeal with consequential relief.
10\. The Revenue's appeal is with regard to the quantum of penalty imposed
including the Factory Acceptance Test charges and Systems Engineering charges.
Interest under 11AB was demanded. Penalty under Section 11AC was levied equal
to the duty liability with effect from 29.9.1996 i.e. the date of enactment of
Section 11AC/11AB. A penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs under Rules 9(2), 173Q and 226 of
the Central Excise Rules 1944 was levied on M/s. ABB Ltd. M/s. ABB has
strongly challenged the findings of the Adjudicating Authority.
4\. Shri G. Shiva Dass, the learned advocate appeared for M/s. ABB and Shri
N.K. Bajpai, the learned advocate and Shri L. Narasimha Murthy, the learned
SDR appeared for the Revenue.
5\. Shri G. Shiva Dass, the learned Advocate made the following submissions:
(1) The learned advocate, at the outset explained the functioning of DCS. The
DCS manufactured by M/s. ABB is used in various industries like chemical,
paper, petroleum to control the processes like pressure, temperature level,
humidity, flow of liquids etc. The DCS is a collection of PCBs consisting of
several modules, which in turn consist of micro processors mounted on PCBs,
power supply with elements to connect the DCS to the workstation. The present
generation of DCS helps in having limited personnel to monitor and supervise
the working of the Plant. M/s. ABB along with DCS supplied the work station
also. The work stations are specialized computers which are bought from
various manufacturers like HP, Zenith. These computers are the normal stand
alone standardized computers, which are purchased with the system software
loaded on them. The Customers place consolidated purchase orders on M/s. ABB
for supply of DCS and software. After receipt of purchase orders from the
customers, the appellants undertake the manufacture of the DCS and supply them
to their customers on payment of applicable duties. The value of engineering
software which is part of the DCS and which is etched in the modules of the
DCS is already included in the value of the DCS on which duty is paid. As
regards application software, they import the master and MOD 300 software and
the same is assessed under heading 85.24 of the Customs Tariff and for the
period from 1.3.1997 onwards, they are allowed duty free under Notification
No. 11/97-Cus. dated 1.3.1997. The imported software is customzed to the
Customer's specific requirement. The customized software is thereafter
separately supplied under commercial invoices and gets loaded at the
customer's site into the engineering/operator workstation, which are nothing
but data processing machines. The software is loaded on to computers using
conventional loading devices like CD floppy, tape drive etc., and each of the
DCS is identified by way of computer code address.
(2) Upto 1993, they were classifying the DCS under heading 84.71 as Automatic
Data Processing Machines. The corresponding application software was
classified under sub-heading 8524.90 as Computer Software and the benefit of
exemption under Notification 84/89-CE dated 1.3.1989 and 48/94-Ce dated
1.3.1994 was claimed. All the CLs and CDs were duly approved by the
Department. Along with the CL, they filed technical write-up for the equipment
in question.
(3) The investigation into the classification of software was in pursuance to
the issue of Circular No. 7/98-Cus. dated 10.2.1998 in connection with
exemption granted from customs duty under Notification No. 11/97 dated
1.3.1997 as amended by Notification No. 3/98-Cus. clarifying the scope of
expression Computer Software.
(4) The application software supplied by the appellants is only Computer
Software. The application software is admittedly used only in the computer or
the workstation at the customer's site. This software works on the operating
software already loaded in the computer and which functions as a platform to
enable further operations. The application software cannot be etched as such
on EPROM. Thus, the application software supplied by M/s. ABB is to be
considered as Computer Software only.
(5) Computer software has not been defined in the Central Excise Tariff. The
Central Excise Tariff does not make any distinction between Computer Software
to be used with computers classifiable under Chapter heading 84.71 and any
other software which is to be used elsewhere. Therefore the distinction sought
to be made by the department between Computer Software and other software is
totally unwarranted and irrelevant. The term has to be understood in the
matter known in common parlance.
(6) In Notification 3/98-Cus. an explanation clarifying the scope of Computer
Software was added. This explanation is not applicable to Central Excise
Tariff. The Tribunal, in the case of ANZ Grindlays Bank v. CC, Chennai 2002
(148) ELT 758 : 2002 (102) ECR 199 (T), has specifically taken note of the
fact that Computer Software being unconditionally exempt under Central Excise
Tariff, has upheld the non-levy of CVD on Computer Software imported into
India.
(7) The software that is excluded from the exemption in the Customs
Notification is that software which is required for the operation of any
machine performing any function other than data processing and which contains
within itself an Automatic Data Processing machine or works in conjunction
with an automatic data processing. For example, ATMs installed by various
banks. In the instant case, the software is not loaded on to a machine but is
loaded on to a computer that works in tandem with the machine. This would not
be excluded from the Notification merely because of the reason that the
software is customized for the machine. It was submitted that the software in
question is supplied separately in disks, floppies and tapes for loading on to
the work station which are nothing but Computers/Automatic Data Processing
machines. Thus the software in question cannot, even on merits, considered to
be anything other than Computer Software.
(8) In the following cases, the software imported was capable of being put to
use only with the specific machines classifiable under Chapter headings other
than 84.71 and not with a computer or a stand alone Automatic Data Processing
machines classifiable under Chapter Heading 84.71, but in those cases the
customs exemption was extended.

in
(ii) BPL Telecom Ltd. v. CC Affirmed by SC in
(iii) CC v. Secure Meters Ltd. 2002 (149) ELT 884 Affirmed by SC in
(iv) Pentafour Software and Exports Ltd. v. CC
(v) Hutchison Max Telecom Ltd. v. CC
(vi) CC v. Malvika Steel Ltd.
(vii) Bay Talkitec Pvt. Ltd. v. CC (9) The entire demand is barred by
limitation as the appellants filed declaration from time to time declaring
both DCS and the software. The functioning of the goods in question has also
been fully explained to the authorities. The department has approved the
CL/declaration all along. Both the appellants and the department were under
the belief that the application software in question was nothing but Computer
Software. But for the issue of Board's Circular dated 10.2.1998, there would
have been no change in the view of the department. Therefore the allegation of
suppression with intention to evade payment of duty cannot be substantiated.
(10) If duty had been paid on the software, the same would have been taken as
modvat credit by the buyers. Hence the entire exercise is one of revenue
neutrality. In this regard, he relied on the following decisions:
(i) CCE v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
(ii) Amco Batteries Ltd. v. CCE 2003 (153) ELT 7 (SC) : 2003 (107) ECR 190
(SC)
(iii) BPL Ltd. v. CCE (F.O. No. 761/2004 dated 8.4.2004) : 2004 (114) ECR 669
(T-Bang)
(iv) CCE v. BPL Sanyo Utilities and Appliances 2004 (62) RLT 293 (11) The
System Engineering Charges relate to activity undertaken by the appellants at
site in connection with the lay out of the DCS, site engineering. It is not
connected with the manufacture of DCS at all. Hence, the same is not
includible in the assessable value.
(12) Revenue, in its appeal, has sought imposition of mandatory penalty for
the period prior to 28.9.1996 also. It is now well settled that mandatory
penalty equal to duty can be imposed only for the clearances after 28.9.1996.
Case Law CCE v. Elgi Equipments Ltd. 2001 (128) ELT 52.
6\. Shri N.K. Bajpai, the learned advocate urged the following points:
(1) Although the Classification Lists (CL) and Classification Declarations
(CD) field by M/s. ABB described the software manufactured by them as
'Computer Software', neither the production of software was entered in the RGI
register nor were the removals shown in the RT 12 returns, which are actually
mandatory requirements under the Central Excise Rules. These allegations made
in the Show Cause Notice have not been rebutted in the reply.
(2) The description of the items given in the commercial invoice is different
from that given in the classification list/declaration. In the Cl, for
claiming the benefit of exemption under Notification 48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994,
the description given was Computer Software whereas in the invoices they are
described in the following manner.
(a) Software for Controller Data Acquisition System
(b) Software for Operator Interface Subsystem
(c) Software for engineering interface
(d) Foreign Device Interface Software
(e) Software to meet all functional requirement of the DCS, PLC etc. Since
M/s. ABB were claiming the exemption, they were duty bound to give the correct
description in the CL so that the Authorities could have examined whether the
goods were actually Computer Software.
(3) Since DCS was not to be classified under sub-heading 84.71 which is the
entry for Automatic Data Processing Machines (Computers), the software used in
DCS could not, by the same logic, be treated as Computer Software. In fact,
DCS is classifiable under sub-heading 90.32.
(4) Since Systems Engineering charges are towards certain activities related
to and incidental to the manufacture and supply of DCS, they should form part
of the assessable value as rightly concluded by the adjudicating authority.
(5) In view of the mis-declaration of the software for DCS as Computer
Software, the longer period under proviso to Section 11A(1) is invokable.
(6) In view of the retrospective amendment of Section 11A by the Finance Act
2000, a notice under Section 11A for short levy could be validly issued even
when the CL had been approved by the proper officer. The Constitutional
validity of amendment to Section 11A has been upheld by Supreme Court in ITW
Signode India Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise
7\. We have heard the rival contentions. The short point in this case is
whether the software for DCS manufactured and cleared by M/s. ABB is
classifiable as Computer Software for Central Excise purposes. The period of
dispute is from 1.4.1994 to 1.6.1998. During the period from 1.4.1994 to
22.7.1996, the term Computer Software was not mentioned in the Tariff at all.
However there was an exemption Notification 48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994 exempting
Computer Software from Central Excise duty. Computer Software was classified
under 8425.90. With effect from 23.7.1996 up to 1.6.1998, there was an entry
"Computer Software" under 8524.20 in the Tariff with NIL rate of duty. The
notification was rescinded with effect from 2.6.1998. The entry "Computer
Software" was amended to "Software" only. In view of this change, Revenue
holds the view that "Computer Software" is different from Software. It should
also be borne in mind that the term "Computer Software" has not been defined
either in the Central Excise Tariff or in the Notification during the disputed
period. Before deciding the issue in this appeal, it is worthwhile dwelling on
what "software" is. Only in recent times, the term "software" has become part
of the common English vocabulary. Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd., London has
published a dictionary of new words (EOLOGISMS) formed in the English language
since 1960. This dictionary indicates that the term "software" has come into
usage since 1960. According to this Dictionary, software means "the programs
which give instructions to the hardware and which actually make it work,
without which the machine is still effectively dumb, albeit immensely a
complex collection of electronics." Further, it is stated that software means
packages that have been worked out in advance to take advantage of the ability
of the machine to perform a wide variety of tasks like word processing,
calculations, spreadsheets, data desk management etc. In simple words, the
various physical components of a computer are known as hardware. In order that
the computer functions, what is required is software. Software is always
associated with computer. Nowadays, all the English dictionaries contain the
word 'software' as computers have invaded all aspects of our lives in the
present century. The Oxford Advance Learners' Dictionary defines Software as
programmes used to operate a computer. The Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia on
Internet gives very useful information on Computer Software. According to the
above encyclopedia, Computer Software (or simply software) refers to one or
more computer programmes and data held in the storage of a computer for some
purpose. Software is divided into two big classes. System Software and
Application Software. All other Sub-classes belong to these two classes.
System Software helps run the computer hardware and computer system. It
includes operating systems device, drivers, programming tools servers,
windowing systems, utilities and more. Application software allows a user to
accomplish one or more specific tasks. Typical applications include business
software, educational software, data base and computer games etc. The term
software was first used by John W. Turkey in 1957. Colloquially the term is
often used to mean Application Software. In computer science and software
engineering. Computer Software is all information processed by computer
system, programmes and data. We have given the above details only to indicate
the popular understanding of what Software is. In all the standard textbooks
and encyclopedias, no distinction has been made between 'Software' and
'Computer Software'. In the instant case, the software developed by M/s. ABB
is for the Distributor Control System. This DCS has application sin various
process industries for controlling the various parameters like pressure,
temperature, flow of liquids etc. From the literature available, it is seen
that the software developed by M/s. ABB are supplied in tapes, floppies or
disks and are loaded into the workstations which are nothing but computers.
Under these circumstances, we fail to understand how the Revenue excludes them
from the scope of the term "Computer Software". In other words, the Central
Excise Tariff does not differentiate between 'Software' and 'Computer
Software' for the reason that in the common parlance and also as understood by
computer processionals, any software is Computer Software. Of course, for
customs purposes, a restricted meaning has been given to Computer Software in
view of amendment to Notification 11/97 and Board Circular dated 10.2.1998.
The above mentioned Board Circular clarifies the meaning of computer software
in the following manner:
4\. Having regard to the discussion above, it is clarified that for the
purposes of the exemption under Section No. 173 of Notification No. 11/97-Cus.
dated 1.3.1997, 'Computer Software' is to be taken to mean any representation
of instructions, data sound or image including source code and object code,
recorded in a machine readable form and capable of being manipulated or
providing interactivity to a user, by means of an automatic data processing
machine falling under Heading 84,71. Thus, the said exemption will not cover
software required for operation of any machine performing a specific function
other than data processing and incorporating or working in conjunction with an
automatic data processing machine. More specifically, software for telecom,
medical or other applications is not eligible for exemption from duty.
However, software containing encyclopedia, games, books, etc. will be eligible
for the exemption wherever they satisfy the interactivity criterion.
8\. We do not want to have a detailed discussion on the scope of Computer
Software as per Board's Circular because the same is confined to customs
purposes only. Moreover the learned advocate Shri Bajpai said that he is not
pressing much on the clarification issued on the customs side. In the Show
Cause Notice, there is a constant refrain that the DCS software cannot be used
on a general purpose computer. The Central Excise Exemption Notification does
not say that softwares used on general purpose computer only are entitled for
exemption. Hence, the fact that the DCS software cannot be used in our home
computes does not dis-entitle the same for exemption. From the statements
given by the officers of M/s. ABB, it is very clear that they were also under
the bonafide belief that DCS software is included in computer software and,
therefore, is entitled for the exemption. While filling the classification
list, they had given the technical literature to the Department. The
Department did not raise any objection at that time because the department was
also having the same view. The genesis of the Show Cause Notice itself is on
account of the introduction of the definition of Computer Software in the
Customs Notification. In such circumstances, a charge of mis-declaration by
M/s. ABB has no force.
9\. Summing up, we hold that as far as the Central Excise Notification No.
48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994 is concerned, all Software are eligible for exemption
and one cannot import the definition of Computer Software in the Customs
Notification to deny the benefit of exemption to DCS software. The charge of
mis-declaration also cannot be sustained. As regards non-inclusion of Systems
Engineering charges, there is force in the appellants' contention that such
activity has been undertaken at site in connection with the layout of the DCS
and is in no way connected with the manufacture of the DCS. In view of this,
we allow the party's appeal with consequential relief.
10\. The Revenue's appeal is with regard to the quantum of penalty imposed
under Section 11 AC and interest demanded under Section 11AB. Since we have
set aside the OIO. Revenue's appeal is rendered infructuous. The Revenue's
appeal is dismissed.

Interest under 11AB was demanded. Penalty under Section 11AC was levied equal
to the duty liability with effect from 29.9.1996 i.e. the date of enactment of
Section 11AC/11AB. A penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs under Rules 9(2), 173Q and 226 of
the Central Excise Rules 1944 was levied on M/s. ABB Ltd. M/s. ABB has
strongly challenged the findings of the Adjudicating Authority.

software which is part of the DCS and which is etched in the modules of the
DCS is already included in the value of the DCS on which duty is paid. As
regards application software, they import the master and MOD 300 software and
the same is assessed under heading 85.24 of the Customs Tariff and for the
period from 1.3.1997 onwards, they are allowed duty free under Notification
No. 11/97-Cus. dated 1.3.1997. The imported software is customzed to the
list, they had given the technical literature to the Department. The
Department did not raise any objection at that time because the department was
also having the same view. The genesis of the Show Cause Notice itself is on
account of the introduction of the definition of Computer Software in the
Customs Notification. In such circumstances, a charge of mis-declaration by
M/s. ABB has no force.
9\. Summing up, we hold that as far as the Central Excise Notification No.
48/94-CE dated 1.4.1994 is concerned, all Software are eligible for exemption
and one cannot import the definition of Computer Software in the Customs
Notification to deny the benefit of exemption to DCS software. The charge of
mis-declaration also cannot be sustained. As regards non-inclusion of Systems
Engineering charges, there is force in the appellants' contention that such
activity has been undertaken at site in connection with the layout of the DCS
and is in no way connected with the manufacture of the DCS. In view of this,
we allow the party's appeal with consequential relief.
10\. The Revenue's appeal is with regard to the quantum of penalty imposed
