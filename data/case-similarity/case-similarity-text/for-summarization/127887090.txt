    Hon'ble Rajes Kumar,J.
Heard Sri Ashok Khare, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the
petitioner and Ms. Suman Sirohi, learned Standing Counsel, appearing on behalf
of the respondents.
Brief facts, giving rise to the present petition, are that there is an
institution, named as Janta Inter College, situated at Lisarh, District
Muzaffarnagar (hereinafter referred to as the 'institution), which is
imparting education upto Class XII. The said institution is government aided
and is a recognised institution, which is being governed by the provisions of
1989 against the short term vacancy as C.T. Grade teacher in accordance with
Paragraph-2 of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission (Removal of
Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981 and such short term vacancy subsequently
converted into a substantive vacancy after 7.8.1993 and further where the
teacher so appointed continued as a teacher on the date of commencement of the
Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission and Selection
Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992. The object of the Section is very clear.
It provides regularisation of those teachers, who have been
(i) appointed prior to 13th May, 1989;
(ii) such vacancy subsequently converted into the substantive vacancy after
the date of enactment of the Section, i.e., after 7.8.1993;
(iii) such teacher, so appointed, continued as a teacher on the date of
commencement of the Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission
and Selection Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992.
In view of the foregoing discussions, I am of the view that the petitioner is
not entitled for regularisation under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i) of the Act..
and is a recognised institution, which is being governed by the provisions of
the U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 and the provisions of U.P. High
School and Intermediate College (Payment of Salary to Teachers and other
Employees) Act, 1971 are applicable. One Sri Krishna Pal Singh, a permanent
C.T. Grade teacher, who was working in the institution, proceeded on long
leave on 22.11.1997 giving rise to a short term vacancy in C.T. Grade. The
Committee of Management invited application for filling up the short term
vacancy for which the petitioner also applied. The Selection Committee took
interview as a result of which recommended the name of the petitioner for
appointment on the short term vacancy so caused. The recommendation of the
Selection committee has been accepted by the Committee of Management and by a
resolution of the Committee of Management, the petitioner has been appointed
as a C.T. Grade teacher. The papers were forwarded to the District Inspector
of Schools for according approval to the appointment of the petitioner on
7.7.1988. Consequently, the Committee of Management issued an appointment
letter dated 7.7.1988 to the petitioner, who joined the institution on
8.7.1988 as a C.T. Grade teacher. The District Inspector of Schools, vide
order dated 12.7.1988, accorded approval to the appointment of the petitioner
till 20.12.1988. It appears that Sri Krishna Pal Singh again sought extension
of his leave upto 30.6.1989, which was accepted. The College vide letter dated
15.12.1989 sought fresh approval from the District Inspector of Schools. The
District Inspector of Schools vide order dated 30.12.1988 again approved
appointment of the petitioner upto 30.4.1989. The petitioner continued to
teach classes upto 30.4.1989. Thereafter, the College was closed for summer
vacation and re-opened in July, 1989. It appears that Sri Krishna Pal Singh
tendered his resignation on 25.5.1989 giving rise to a substantive vacancy.
When the petitioner intended to join his duty in July, 1989, he was told that
as the District Inspector of Schools had accorded approval to his appointment
only till 30.4.1989, he could not be paid salary under the Payment of Salary
Act till District Inspector of Schools accords approval afresh. He was further
told that he may continue to take classes till fresh approval is accorded for
which he would be paid salary from the College fund. On the assurance of the
College administration, the petitioner continued to work at the salary of
Rs.750/= per month only which was being paid by the College. When the salary
has not been paid, the petitioner filed a representation dated 28.8.1989
before the District Inspector of Schools. When the approval of appointment for
further period has not been accorded by the District Inspector of Schools and
he was not being paid salary, he filed present petition seeking a mandamus to
the respondents not to interfere in the working of the petitioner as adhoc
C.T. Grade Teacher till a candidate duly recommended by the Commission/Board
joins the post or till the services of the petitioner are dispensed with in
accordance with law and to pay the arrears of salary as C.T. Grade teacher
under the Payment of Salaries Act with effect from May, 1989 onwards. The writ
petition was entertained and the respondents were directed to file the counter
affidavit. An interim order was also passed to the extent that the respondents
were restrained from interfering with the functioning of the petitioner as a
C.T. Grade teacher and they were also directed to pay the entire amount of
salary due to him within one month and also go on paying the current salary as
and when fell due.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of the interim
order, the petitioner is working and is getting salary, therefore, his
services should be regularised under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i) of Act No. 5 of
1982 (U.P. Secondary Education (Services Selection Board) Act, 1982). He
submitted that in those cases where the short term vacancy has been converted
into the substantive vacancy, even before insertion of Section 33-B, which was
inserted by U.P. Act No. 1 of 1993, with effect from 7.8.1993, if the cases of
such teacher will not be considered for regularisation, the very purposes of
enactment of this Section will frustrate and the Section will become redundant
and will be unworkable.
Learned Standing Counsel submitted that Section 33-B has been inserted with
effect from 7.8.1993 with prospective effect. Thus, only those cases where the
short term vacancy is being converted into a substantive vacancy after
7.8.1993 are covered under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i). It has been further
submitted that Section 33(1)(c) provides that only those teachers who are
continuously working in the institution from the date of such appointment upto
the date of commencement of the Act will be eligible for regularisation. In
the present case, the petitioner's appointment has been approved only upto
30.4.1989, thereafter, he is working in the institution on the strength of the
interim order granted by this Court. The interim order does not confer any
right to the petitioner. Since the appointment of the petitioner has not been
accorded approval by the District Inspector of Schools after 30.4.1989,
therefore, he has no legal right to continue on the post. She, further
submitted that the petitioner's appointment was made against the short term
vacancy, which has arisen on account of long leave taken by Sri Krishna Pal
Singh. When he resigned on 25.5.1989, the short term vacancy ceased to exist
and the vacancy became substantive vacancy, therefore, the petitioner had no
right to continue thereafter in view of Full Bench's decision of this Court in
the case of Smt. Pramila Misra vs. Deputy Director of Education, Jhansi and
others, reported in (1997) 2 UPLBEC, 1320. In the circumstances, his
continuance as a C.T. Grade teacher in the institution was without the
authority of law and it cannot be treated that the petitioner was legally
serving in the institution as a teacher on the date of commencement of the
Act.
I have considered rival submissions.
I do not find any substance in the argument of learned counsel for the
petitioner.
In the writ petition, the petitioner has not sought any relief for
regularisation of his services. The petitioner has only sought the mandamus
restraining the respondents from interfering in the working of the petitioner
as a C.T. Grade Teacher and to pay him salary. The said relief sought by the
petitioner has no substance. The petitioner was engaged as a C.T. Grade
teacher against the short term vacancy, which has been caused on account of
the leave taken by Sri Krishna Pal Singh on 22.12.19.87 and the District
Inspector of Schools accorded approval to the appointment of the petitioner on
12.7.1988 only upto 20.12.1988, which has been further extended upto
30.4.1989. Thereafter, the approval has not been extended or granted by the
District Inspector of Schools, therefore, the petitioner has no right to
continue on the post without the approval granted by the District Inspector of
Schools. Moreover, on 25.5.1989, Sri Krishna Pal Singh had resigned from the
post and as such the short term vacancy ceased to exist and it converted into
a substantive vacancy. Reliance is placed on the Full Bench's decision of this
Court in the case of Smt. Pramila Misra vs. Deputy Director of Education,
Jhansi and others (Supra). When the short term vacancy converted into a
substantive vacancy, the petitioner's right to continue as a C.T. Grade
teacher ceased. The substantive vacancy could either be filled by adhoc
appointment by adopting proper procedure under the First Removal of
Difficulties order, 1981 and now by the Commission under the Act of 1982 as
amended from time to time. Therefore, the continuance of the petitioner on the
post was without any authority of law. It is a well settled principle of law
that the interim order does not confer any right and, therefore, on the basis
of the interim order, even if the petitioner continued on the post, it cannot
be said that the petitioner continued to serve the institution as a teacher on
the date of commencement of the Act. My view finds support from the following
decisions:
In Committee of Management Arya Nagar Inter College v. Sri Kumar Tiwari, 1997
(4) SCC 388: AIR 1997 SC 3071, the services of the respondent came to be
terminated on 30th June, 1988, whereafter he obtained interim order and
continued thereunder. Thus, he continued in service not by virtue of his own
right under an order of appointment, but on account of interim order and the
Court, thus, held that no benefit of such continuance can be allowed. In South
Eastern Coalfields Ltd. vs. State of M.P. And others, 2003 (8) SCC 648: (AIR
2003 SC 4482), the Court recognized the principle that wrong order should not
be perpetuated by keeping it alive. Recognizing the maxim auctus curiae
neminem gravabit, it was held that no one shall suffer by an act of the Court
and such a rule is not confined to an erroneous act of the Court but act of
the Court embraces within its purview all such acts as to which the Court may
form an opinion in any legal proceedings that the Court would not have so
acted had it been correctly apprised of the facts and law. It is duty of the
Court to apply the restitution putting the parties in the same position as
they would have been, had the order, subsequently found to be erroneous by the
Court, would not have been passed. In para 28 of the judgment, it was held
(para 26 of AIR).
"The injury, if any, caused by the act of the Court shall be undone and the
gain which the parties would have earned unless it was interdicted by the
order of the Court would be restored to or conferred on the party by suitably
commanding the party liable to do so. Any opinion to the contrary would lead
to unjust if not disastrous consequences. Litigation may turn into a fruitful
industry. Though litigation is not gambling yet there is an element of chance
in every litigation. Unscrupulous litigants may feel encouraged to approach
the Court persuading the Court to pass interlocutory orders favourable to them
by making out a prima facie case when the issues are yet to be heard and
determined on merits and if the concept of restitution is excluded from
application to interim orders, then the litigant would stand to gain by
swallowing the benefits yielding out of the interim order even though the
battle has been lost at the end. This cannot be countenanced." (emphasis
added) Considering from another angle, where an interim order is passed and
the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the effect would be as if no order
was ever passed. That being so, the incumbent does not gain on the basis of
mere continuance since he has no legal or valid right to continue. An interim
order passed by the Court merges with the final order and, therefore, the
result brought by dismissal of the writ petition is that the interim order
becomes non est. A Division Bench of this Court in Shyam Lal v. State of U.P.,
AIR 1968 Allahabad , while considering the effect of dismissal of writ
petition on interim order passed by the Court has laid down as under:
"It is well settled that an interim order merges in the final order and does
not exist by itself. So the result brought about by an interim order would be
non est in the eye of law if the final final order grants no relief. The grant
of interim relief when the petition was ultimately dismissed could not have
the effect to postponing implementation of the order of compulsory retirement.
It must in the circumstances take effect as if there was no interim order."
The same principle has been reiterated in the following cases:
(A) AIR 1975 Allahabad 280, Sri Ram Charan Das v. Pyare Lal.
"In Shyam Lal v. State of U.P., AIR 1968 All 139, a Bench of this Court has
held that orders of stay or injunction are interim orders that merge in final
orders passed in the proceedings. The result brought about by the interim
order becomes non est in the eye of law if final order grants no relief. In
this view of the matter it seems to us that the interim stay became non est
and lost all the efficacy, the Commissioner having upheld the permission which
became effective from the date it was passed."
(B) 1986 (40 LCD 196, Shyam Manohar Shukla v. State of U.P.
"It is settled law that in interim order passed in a case which is ultimately
dismissed is to be treated as not having been passed at all (see Shyam Lal v.
state of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow), AIR 1968 Allahabad 139 and Sri Ram Charan
Das v. Pyare Lal, AIR 1975 Allahabad 280 (DB)."
(C) AIR 1994 Allahabad 273, Kanoria Chemicals & Industries Ltd. v. U.P. State
Electricity Board. (Para 7).
"After the dismissal of the writ petitions wherein notification dated
21-4-1990 was stayed, the result brought about by the interim orders staying
the notification, became non est in the eye of law and lost all its efficacy
and the notification became effective from the beginning."
In the case of Raghavendra Rao Etc. v. State of Karnataka and others, etc.,
reported in JT 2009 (2) SC 520, the Apex Court held as follows:
Para-16. It is now a well-settled principle of law that merely because an
employee had continued under cover of an order of Court, he would not be
entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service . This
Court in Uma Devi (3) (supra), held as under :
"Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment
is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core
of our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order
upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the need
to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of the
Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public employment,
this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the
appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper competition
among qualified persons, the same would not confer any right on the appointee.
If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end
of the contract, if it were an engagement or appointment on daily wages or
casual basis, the same would come to an end when it is discontinued.
Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the
expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely
because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time
beyond the term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in
regular service or made permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance,
if the original appointment was not made by following a due process of
selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court to
prevent regular recruitment at the instance of the temporary employees whose
period of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very
nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. High Courts acting
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue
directions for absorption, regularization, or permanent continuance unless the
recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of the constitutional
scheme. Merely because, an employee had continued under cover of an order of
Court, which we have described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part
of the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made
permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be
justified in issuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the
employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it
to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be
caused to him, whereas the interim direction to continue his employment would
hold up the regular procedure for selection or imposed on the State the burden
of paying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be careful
in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of
its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the
instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory
mandates."
Recently in Official Liquidator v. Dayanand & Ors. [JT 2008 (11) SC 467 ; 2008
(10) SCC 1], this Court has reiterated the same view.
Now let us examine the claim of the petitioner for regularisation of his
appointment under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i). Section-33(B)(a)(i) has been enacted
by the U.P. Act No. 1 of 1993 with effect from 7.8.1993. It reads as follows:
33-B. Regularisation of certain other appointments.- (1) Any teacher, other
than the Principal or Headmaster, who-
(a)(i) was appointed by promotion or by direct recruitment in the Lecturer
grade or Trained Graduate grade on or before May 14, 1991 or in the
Certificate of Teaching grade on or before May 13, 1989 against a short term
vacancy in accordance with Paragraph 2 of the Uttar Pradesh Secondary
Education Services Commission (Removal of Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981
and such vacancy was subsequently converted into a substantive vacancy: or
(ii)was appointed by direct recruitment on or after July 14, 1981 but not
later than June 12, 1985 on ad hoc basis against substantive vacancy in the
Certificate of Teaching grade through advertisement and such appointment was
approved by the Inspector; or
(iii)was appointed by promotion or by direct recruitment on or after July 31,
1988 but later than May 14, 1991 on ad hoc basis against a substantive vacancy
in accordance with Section 18 (as it stood before its substitution by the
Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Service Commission and Selection Boards
(Amendment) Act, 1991;
(b)possesses the qualification prescribed under or is exempted from such
qualification in accordance with the provisions of the Intermediate Education
Act, 1921;
(c)has been continuously serving the Institution from the date of such
appointment upto the date of the commencement of the Act referred to in sub-
clause (iii) of clause (a);
(d)is not related to any member of the management or the Principal or Head
Master of the Institution concerned in the manner specified in the explanation
to sub-section (3) of Section 33-A;
(e)has been found suitable for appointment in a substantive capacity by a
Selection Committee constituted under sub-section (2) shall be given
substantive appointment by the Management.
(2)(a) For each region, there shall be a Selection Committee comprising-
(i)Regional Deputy Director of Education of that region, who shall be the
Chairman,
(ii)One officer holding a Group "A" post (specified as such by the State
Government from time to time) in any department other than Education
Department, to be nominated by the state Government,
(iii)Regional Inspectress of Girls Schools of that region :
Provided that the Inspector of the district shall be co-opted as a member
while considering the case for regularisation of that district.
(b) The Selection Committee constituted under clause (a) shall consider the
case of every such teacher and on being satisfied about his eligibility and
suitability in view of the provision of sub-section (1) shall, subject to the
provisions of sub-section (3) recommend his name to the management for
appointment under sub-section (1) in a substantive vacancy.
(3) (a) The names of the teachers shall be recommended for substantive
appointment in order of seniority as seniority from the date of their
appointment.
(b) If two or more such teachers are appointed on the same date, the teacher
who is older in age shall be recommended first.
(4) Every teacher appointed in a substantive capacity under sub-section (1)
shall be deemed to be on probation from the date of such substantive
appointment.
(5) A teacher who is not found suitable under sub-section (1) and a teacher
who is not eligible to get a substantive appointment under that sub-section
shall cease to hold the appointment on such date as the State Government may
by order specify.
(6) Nothing in the Section shall be construed to entitle any teacher to
substantive appointment if on the date of commencement of the Act referred to
in sub-section (iii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1), such vacancy had
already been filled or selection for such vacancy has already been made in
accordance with this Act.
There is no dispute that Section 33-B has been enacted with effect from
7.8.1993. There is also nothing to suggest that it operates retrospectively.
It is well settled principle of law that in the absence of any thing to the
contrary, the provision enacted operates prospectively. Therefore, I am of the
view that the sentence 'such vacancy was subsequently converted into a
substantive vacancy' in Section 33-B(1)(a)(i) means, the short term vacancy
converted into substantive vacancy after commencement of the Act, that is,
after 7.8.1993 and not prior to that. The submission of learned counsel for
the petitioner that in case if it will not include those cases where the short
term vacancy has been converted into substantive vacancy prior to 7.8.1993,
the Section will become unworkable and redundant cannot be accepted. It very
well covers those cases where the appointment has been made prior to 13th May,
1989 against the short term vacancy as C.T. Grade teacher in accordance with
Paragraph-2 of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission (Removal of
Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981 and such short term vacancy subsequently
converted into a substantive vacancy after 7.8.1993 and further where the
teacher so appointed continued as a teacher on the date of commencement of the
Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission and Selection
Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992. The object of the Section is very clear.
It provides regularisation of those teachers, who have been
(i) appointed prior to 13th May, 1989;
(ii) such vacancy subsequently converted into the substantive vacancy after
the date of enactment of the Section, i.e., after 7.8.1993;
(iii) such teacher, so appointed, continued as a teacher on the date of
commencement of the Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission
and Selection Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992.
In view of the foregoing discussions, I am of the view that the petitioner is
not entitled for regularisation under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i) of the Act..
In the result, the writ petition being devoid of merit is dismissed. The
interim order stands discharged.
No order as to cost.

vacancy for which the petitioner also applied. The Selection Committee took
interview as a result of which recommended the name of the petitioner for
appointment on the short term vacancy so caused. The recommendation of the
Selection committee has been accepted by the Committee of Management and by a
resolution of the Committee of Management, the petitioner has been appointed
as a C.T. Grade teacher. The papers were forwarded to the District Inspector
of Schools for according approval to the appointment of the petitioner on
7.7.1988. Consequently, the Committee of Management issued an appointment
letter dated 7.7.1988 to the petitioner, who joined the institution on
8.7.1988 as a C.T. Grade teacher. The District Inspector of Schools, vide
order dated 12.7.1988, accorded approval to the appointment of the petitioner
till 20.12.1988. It appears that Sri Krishna Pal Singh again sought extension
of his leave upto 30.6.1989, which was accepted. The College vide letter dated
15.12.1989 sought fresh approval from the District Inspector of Schools. The
District Inspector of Schools vide order dated 30.12.1988 again approved
appointment of the petitioner upto 30.4.1989. The petitioner continued to
teach classes upto 30.4.1989. Thereafter, the College was closed for summer
vacation and re-opened in July, 1989. It appears that Sri Krishna Pal Singh
tendered his resignation on 25.5.1989 giving rise to a substantive vacancy.
When the petitioner intended to join his duty in July, 1989, he was told that
as the District Inspector of Schools had accorded approval to his appointment
only till 30.4.1989, he could not be paid salary under the Payment of Salary
Act till District Inspector of Schools accords approval afresh. He was further
told that he may continue to take classes till fresh approval is accorded for
1989 against the short term vacancy as C.T. Grade teacher in accordance with
Paragraph-2 of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission (Removal of
Difficulties) (Second) Order, 1981 and such short term vacancy subsequently
converted into a substantive vacancy after 7.8.1993 and further where the
teacher so appointed continued as a teacher on the date of commencement of the
Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission and Selection
Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992. The object of the Section is very clear.
It provides regularisation of those teachers, who have been
(i) appointed prior to 13th May, 1989;
(ii) such vacancy subsequently converted into the substantive vacancy after
the date of enactment of the Section, i.e., after 7.8.1993;
(iii) such teacher, so appointed, continued as a teacher on the date of
commencement of the Act, that is, U.P. Secondary Education Services Commission
and Selection Boards (Second Amendment) Act, 1992.
In view of the foregoing discussions, I am of the view that the petitioner is
not entitled for regularisation under Section 33-B(1)(a)(i) of the Act..
