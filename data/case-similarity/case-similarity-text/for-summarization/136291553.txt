21.03.2014 and quash the same and consequently, direct the respondents to
reinstate the petitioner with all attending benefits. For Petitioner :
Mr.V.Ayyadurai, Senior Counsel for M/s.V.B.Perumal Raj For Respondents :
Mr.K.K.Sivashanmugam for R1 to R3 O R D E R These batch of writ petitions
involving similar questions of law and facts, are heard together and disposed
of by this common order.
2\. As it appears, the writ petitioners in the aforesaid cases were appointed
by the respondents bank as Sub-staffs in different branches/offices of the
respondent bank pursuant to the term of settlement made under Section 12 (3)
of the Industrial Dispute Act. To be more specific, as it appears, from the
averment made in the writ petitions in different branches/offices of the
respondent bank many persons were engaged on daily wage basis to cater to the
need of the official work as menial worker such as messenger, attendant and
etc. Such engagement was without the approval of the Head Office of the
respondent bank and totally on the discretion of the Branch/Office Heads. Such
appointment being continuing for a considerable period, the Union of such
employee demanded their absorption by the respondent as regular employee. For
such consistent and persistent demand, a conciliation was held and in such
conciliation, a settlement was arrived under Section 12(3) of Industrial
Disputes Act, under certain terms and conditions between the Union of such
workers and the respondent banks to absorb such casual/daily wage labourers as
regular staff on the respondent Bank in phase manner provided they had worked
for more than 240 days in an year continuously and continue to work on the
date of such agreement. However, a stipulation was also there in the
settlement that detection of furnishing false certificate shall entail
termination of service. However, the certificate in this regard was required
to be given by the concerned Branch Head/Office Head. Accordingly, many
persons were regularized by necessary order of appointment and the petitioners
are some of such persons appointed pursuant to the same. However, it latter
came to the notice of the respondent bank that some of the Branch/Office Head
of different establishment of the respondent bank, even though no such persons
were working in their establishments on daily wage basis and even working had
no requisite criteria for appointment as a regular staff of the respondent
bank, as provided in the aforesaid settlement, in connivance with such persons
issued certificate in their favour to make them eligible for appointment in
terms of the settlement. Accordingly, the respondent bank scrutinized the
record and when it found that spurious certificate have been issued by some of
the Branch/Office Head for such appointment, terminated such persons from
service. The petitioners in these writ petitions are some of such appointees,
who have been terminated for the aforesaid reasons. Hence, they came to
challenge the same in these batch of writ petitions with the averment that the
same is contrary to the facts and law, inasmuch as, the allegations are
without any substance and also the orders of termination issued to them being
suffering from the vice non observances of principles of natural justice, the
same are liable to be quashed. Prayer has also been made to reinstate them
with all back wages by issuing a writ of certiorarified mandamus.
3\. During the course of hearing, the learned counsel appearing for the writ
petitioners submits that since the termination is by way of a punishment and a
stigmatized one, the respective writ petitioners could not have been
terminated vide the impugned order in the respective writ petitions without
conducting a domestic enquiry to establish the mis-conduct, by giving them a
chance of hearing, in other words without adhering to the principles of Audi
Alteram Partem i.e. no one shall be condemned without being heard, a salutary
principle of natural justice. Since the same in the case had not been adhered
to before the issuance of the impugned orders of termination to the respective
petitioners, the same are liable to be quashed and the respondents be directed
to reinstate the petitioners with the back wages, submits the counsel for the
petitioners.
4\. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank however in response,
submits that the aforesaid contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioners that the order is bad for non-adherence to the principles of Audi
Alteram Partem is fallacious inasmuch as all the petitioners have given
undertakings indicating the fact that if the certificate furnished by them are
found to be spurious, their services are liable for termination without notice
and on enquiry as it was found that the petitioners inconnivance with the
respective Branch Manager/Branch Head, had furnished spurious certificate to
qualify for appointment in terms of the settlement under Section 12 (3) of the
Industrial Dispute Act, arrived between the respondent bank and the employees
Union and so also the said settlement also contained a clause that in the
event the certificate furnished are found to be spurious/false, the service of
the person absorbed pursuant to such settlement is liable for termination.
Reliance in this regard has been placed in the decision of the Supreme Court
of India rendered in the case of Punjab National Bank and others Vs. Manjeet
Singh and Another in Civil Appeal 4330 of 200, so also Barauni Refinery
Pragatisheel Shramik Parikshad and others Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited
reported in AIR 1990 Supreme Court 1801 wherein the Apex Court have held that,
a terms of the settlement arrived under Section 12(3) of the Industrial
Disputes Act is not open to challenge by individual employee or the members of
the minority union on the ground of non-adherence to the principle of Audi
Alteram Partem i.e no one shall be condemned without being heard, inasmuch as
thereafter adherence to the principles of natural justice is an empty
formality and such award is binding on the workmen in view of Section 18(3) of
the Industrial Dispute Act. So far as the reinstatement of the petitioners are
concerned it is submitted that even if their termination is held to be illegal
for non-adherence to the principle of natural justice as contended by the
counsel for the petitioner they are not entitled to reinstatement as a matter
of course in view of the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the case of
Engineering Laugh Udyog Employees Union Vs. Judge Labour Court and Industrial
Tribunal and Another reported in 2003 Supplementary (6) SCR 253 and also the
Punjab High Court in the case of Brij Bhushan Vs. Industrial Tribunal-cum-
Labour cited in 1998 119 Punjab Law Reporter 818. The Apex Court in the case
of Engineering Laugh Udyog Employees Union (cited supra) have held that even
if an order of termination is set aside on the ground of violation of
principles of natural justice, still an employee is not entitled to
reinstatement as a matter of course but can be granted compensation in lieu of
the same. So also in the case of Brij Bhushan the Punjab High Court have held
that if a Court finds an employee has come through back door without having
any qualification, when terminated without complying with the provision of
Section 25 (F) and 25(G) still he is not entitled to the benefit of
reinstatement. In such premises, the petitioners who have got the appointment
by perpetrating fraud, when terminated without notice also cannot be
reinstated. Further more, reliance has also been placed in the case of State
of Karnataka Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others rendered in a Civil Appeal arising out
of SLP (C) No.15774 of 2006, wherein placing reliance in the case State of
Karnataka v. Umadevi reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1, unless a person fulfil the
criteria for regularisation as laid down in the case of Umadevi (referred
supra) he is not entitled to regularisation. Since in this case, the
petitioners are not fulfilling the criteria as provided in this settlement
under Section 12(3) of the Industrial Dispute Act, they have no case and as
such the impugned order of termination need not be interfered with submits the
learned counsel for the respondent.
7\. To appreciate the contentions raised with regard to the sustainability of
the termination order impugned in the different writ petitions it would be
apposite to have a look on the same. Since, the contents of the all the
termination order are almost same, relevant portion of the termination order
in the writ petition No.23447 of 2014 which is the lead case is quoted
hereunder: TERMINATION ORDER You have been appointed in our bank as
Messenger, vide order dated 27.08.2012 and you have joined the Bank at our
Salem Main Branch. At the time of joining the Bank, you had submitted
applications dated 16.12.2011 & 29.08.2012 in Annexure A dated 16.12.2011,
you have stated that you have worked from 12.07.2009 to 16.12.2011 at RO
Salem. On verification of our Regional Officer Salem records, it is found that
you had worked as Driver for AGM in RO & Salem Main. Hence, it has been
confirmed that the application in Annexure A dated 16.12.2011 submitted by
you to the bank, wherein you have declared that you were working from
12.07.2009 to 16.12.2011 is not genuine and it is false.
In the undertaking letter dated 16.12.2011 clause (d), you had given a
declaration as follows: Subsequent to my absorption in Banks service, if it
is found that declaration made by me regarding the period of engagement is
found to be false or any of the document submitted by me in support of age,
qualification, caste etc., is found to be bogus. I will be liable to be
terminated from the Banks Service. In application from dated 29.08.2012 you
had given a declaration as follows: I hereby declare that all the information
and particulars given by me in this form are true and correct. I also note
that if any of the above statements are incorrect or false or if any material
information or particular has been suppressed or omitted therefrom, I am
liable to be disqualified and if appointed my appointment will be liable to be
terminated without notice or compensation in lieu of notice. Thus, you had
wilfully and with ulterior motive submitted to bank a false certificate in
support of your experience to obtain appointment in our bank. Your said act of
submitting false experience certificate has disqualified you from employment
and your appointment is liable to be terminated without notice or compensation
in lieu of notice. As per clause 2 of the appointment order dated 27.08.2012,
issued to you and accepted by you: Your services are liable to be terminated,
if your work and conduct are found unsatisfactory, any material information is
suppressed by you, the Certificates submitted by you are found to be not
genuine, false, forged or tampered with by giving one months notice or on
payment of a months pay and allowance in lieu of notice. Accordingly, your
services are hereby terminated without notice by invoking the declaration
given by you in your applications dated 16.12.2011 & 29.08.2012 and clause 2
of the appointment order dated 27.08.2012 issued to you. The termination order
will take effect from the date of this order. A draft bearing No.815395116
dated 25.03.2014 for Rs.12,772.70, being one months pay and allowances in
lieu of notice period, is enclosed. Please acknowledge receipt of this notice
and enclosure.
8\. As it appears, from the aforesaid order of termination impugned in these
batch of writ petitions that the termination of the petitioners who were
admittedly regular employee by the date of termination is for their alleged
mis-conduct i.e. furnishing spurious certificates for seeking appointment in
terms of the settlement made under Section 12 (3) of the Industrial Dispute
Act. The aforesaid therefore a stigmatized termination and by way of a
punishment. No doubt the petitioners had given undertaking that in the event
certificates are found to be spurious the same shall entail the termination of
their service and the same is also undisputably a term of settlement,
notwithstanding the same, the respondent ought to have made an enquiry before
arriving into the conclusion that the certificates were spurious giving an
opportunity of hearing to the respective writ petitioner in this regard.
However without adhering to the same, they have been condemned of obtaining
the employment by furnishing spurious certificate hence, a stigmatized
termination order was issued to them vide the impugned order in the respective
writ petitions. The same is clearly violative of the principle of Audi Alteram
Partem, a salutary principle of natural justice. Absolutely no enquiry was
made under before issuing such order of termination stigmatizing perpetration
of fraud in obtaining the appointment. The termination therefore, being not a
termination simplicitor, but by way of a punishment/stigmatized one without
conducting any enquiry giving a chance of hearing to the petitioner the same,
is violative of the mandate of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India and
as such bad in the eye of law. The aforesaid position of law has been well
settled in a catena of decisions of the Honble Apex Court one of such is
rendered in the case of Satwathi Deswal Vs. State of Haryana reported in 2010
(1) SCC page 126.
9\. The contention of the petitioner, placing reliance in the case of Manjeet
Singh and Another in Civil Appeal 4330 of 200, so also Barauni Refinery
Pragatisheel Shramik Parikshad and others to persuade the Court that in view
of the term of settlement in this regard and the undertaking given the same is
not a required, appears to this Court to be misconceived inasmuch as the
petitioners herein are not challenging such terms of settlement but a
stigmatized termination of them, which is in the nature of penalty, without
giving any chance of hearing and as such the same could not have been passed.
Therefore, the aforesaid ratios of the Apex Court vide the decision cited
supra, is of no assignment to defend the impugned order of Industrial Dispute
Act passed without adhering to the relevant principles of natural
justice/domestice enquiry of such mis-conduct. So far as the reinstatement of
the petitioner is concerned no doubt the same cannot be as a matter of course
especially when in a Industrial Dispute a person terminated can be given
compensation, inspite of his termination is illegal for non-adherence to the
principle of Audi Alteram Partem and also the statutory provisions as seen
from the decision rendered in the case of Engineering Laugh Udyog Employees
Union (cited supra) and Brij Bhushan (Supra). However, the same was rendered
in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case i.e. in the case of
Engineering Laugh Udyog Employees Union (cited supra) there been compensation
was paid in lieu of reinstatement in the Industrial Dispute Act and in the
case of Brij Bhushan (Supra) the Court had found that the wirt petitioner was
a qualified person for appointment. Here in this case, the petitioner claims
that they have not furnished any spurious certificate and the same is yet to
be enquired into and established before removing the petitioners from service
with such stigma giving opportunity to the petitioners. The petitioners are
also the beneficiary of a 12(3) settlement under Industrial Dispute Act, in
such premises, it cannot be said that the petitioners termination even if it
is held to be illegal, they are not entitled to reinstatement. So the
contention in this regard of the respondent must fail. So far as ratio in the
case of M.L.Kesari and others (cited supra) are concerned, the same was
rendered in a case of regularisation not termination of service on the ground
of disqualification for absorption obtained pursuant to the scheme/
settlement. Therefore, the same is also no assistance to the respondent to
defend the order of termination impugned in these writ petitions.
10\. Since in this case, admittedly, the impugned orders of terminations of
the writ petitioners have been passed punitively for obtaining the absorption
as permanent staff by furnishing allegedly spurious certificate qualifying for
absorption without conducting any inquiry though the same is stigmatise one,
giving opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as required under law / the
principle of natural justice, the same is violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution and as such cannot be sustained.
11\. Accordingly these writ petitions are allowed. Consequently, the impugned
order in the respective writ petitioner terminating the service of the
respective writ petitioner and the respondents are directed to reinstate them
in the service within a month of receipt/production of the copy of this order.
However, the petitioners are not entitled to any backwages on such
reinstatement. But it is open to the respondents to proceed against the
petitioner on the ground alleged in the termination order if they so desired
in accordance with the law and take such steps as permissible under law.
Consequently, all the Miscellaneous Petitions stand closed. No costs.
