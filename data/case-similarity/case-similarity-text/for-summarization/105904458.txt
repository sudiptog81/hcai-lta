such right should have been registered with trade mark/patent authority. In

of IPR service for tax liability on reverse charge basis.

Present B.L. Narasimhan with Shri Narendra Singhvi, Advocates for the
appellants Present Shri K. Poddar and Shr G.R. Singh, A.Rs. for Revenue Coram:
Honble Justice (Dr.) Satish Chandra, President Honble Mr. B. Ravichandran,
Technical Member Final Order No.52555/2016 Per B. Ravichandran:
The appeal is against the order dated 26.4.2010 of Commissioner of Central
Excise, Jaipur I.
2\. The brief facts of the case are that the appellants are engaged in the
manufacture of fertilizers , ammonia and other gases. In connection with
developing their manufacturing plant, they have entered into various
agreements with foreign service provider mainly to provide design, engineering
, supervisory and consultancy services. These are broadly either engineering
agreement or licence/process agreement. The Department entertained a view that
the appellants are liable to service tax under the category of Intellectual
Property Right (IPR) service as defined in Section 65 ((105)(zzzr) read with
Section 65 (55a) of the Finance Act, 1994. Proceedings were initiated against
them to demand service tax of Rs.1,42,79,138/- for the period April 2006 to
March 2007.The original authority confirmed the demand of service tax and
imposed equal amount of penalty along with penalties under Section 76 and 77
of the Act.
3\. Ld. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants are not
liable to pay any service tax in term of these agreements as they have not
received any IPR service. It is contended that in none of the cases now under
consideration, the service provider has any right granted by any Indian law
for the time being in force. He relied upon the Board Circular dated 17.9.04
to state that IPR services cover only those rights which are recognized under
Indian law. He relied upon various decided cases to support his contention.
Further, he also submitted that in terms of law laid down by the Honble
Bombay High Court in the case of Indian National Ship owner Association  2013
(STR) 235(Bom.), there is no liability of service recipient located in India
before introduction of Section 66A with effect from 18.4.2006. As such the
agreement entered into on 23.6.2006 cannot be the subject matter of tax
liability. Ld. Counsel also contested the demand on time bar.
4\. Ld. A.R. for Revenue supported the findings of the lower authorities and
stated that there is mention regarding at least two of the agreements with
foreign companies that they had applied for patent in India in 2003. Though
the application has not been allowed, as and when the same is granted, the
appellant will be liable to service tax.
5\. We have heard both sides and examined the appeal records. The only point
for decision is that whether or not the appellant received taxable service
under the category of Intellectual Property Right service during the
relevant period. The admitted facts of the case are that the technical know-
how, engineering design licence involved in these agreements with foreign
service providers are not registered in India under Indian law. However, the
original authority held that registration of IPR under Indian law is only for
obtaining protection from its infringement. He observed that the levy of tax
is not dependent on the fact of such registration. We find that such
conclusion is not legally tenable and is beyond the scope of taxable service
as defined in Finance Act, 1994:
 Section 65 (105)(zzr) of the Act defines in the taxable IPR service tax as
under:
Taxable service means any service provided or to be provided to any person
by the holder of intellectual property right, in relation to intellectual
property service;
Section 65(55a) of the Act defines  Intellectual Property Right to mean as
under:
Intellectual Property Right means any right to intangible property, namely,
trade marks, designs, patents or any other similar intangible property, under
any law for the time being in force, but does not include copyright"
6\. The IPR as defined should be a right under any law for the time being in
force. The legal position on this issue has been examined by various decisions
of the Tribunal which are as under:
a) Rochem Separation Systems (India) Private Limited v. Commissioner of
Service tax, Mumbai I  2015 (39) STR 112 (Tri-Mum) [ para 8];
b) Whirlpool of India Limited vs. C.C.E & S.T., Delhi  2016  VIL  57 
CESTAT  DEL  ST [ para 7 ];
c) Tata Consultancy Services Limited vs. C.S.T., Mumbai \- 2015 TIOL  2370 

d) Area Brown Boveri Ltd. vs. C.C.E & S.T., Bangalore \- 2016 VIL  480 
CESTAT  BLR  ST [ para 6.7.1] ;
e) Reliance Industries Ltd. vs. C.C.E. & S.Tax, Mumbai  2016  TIOL  1654 
CESTAT  MUM [ para 2];
7\. It has been held that to be categorized for service tax purpose under IPR,
such right should have been registered with trade mark/patent authority. In
the present case, admittedly, there is no right recognized as IPR under any
law for the time being in force in India. As such, there can be no provision
of IPR service for tax liability on reverse charge basis.
8\. In view of the settled legal position as held in various decisions of the
Tribunal discussed above, we find that impugned order is without merits and
accordingly set aside the same. The appeal is allowed.
