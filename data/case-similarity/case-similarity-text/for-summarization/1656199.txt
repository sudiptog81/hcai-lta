witness, specifically setting forth the fact of transfer or assignment.
(2) The transfer or assignment shall be complete and effectual upon the
execution of such endorsement or instrument duly attested but 1[except where
the transfer or assignment is in favour of the insurer] shall not be operative
as against an insurer and shall not confer upon the transferee or assignee, or
his legal representative, and right to sue for the amount of such policy or
the moneys secured thereby until a notice in writing of the transfer or
assignment 2[3[and] either the said endorsement or instrument itself or a copy
thereof certified to be correct by both transferor and transferee or their
duly authorised agents] 4[have been delivered] to the insurer 5[***]:]
6[Provided that where the insurer maintains one or more places of business in
7[India], such notice shall be delivered only at the place in 7[India]
mentioned in the policy for the purpose or at his principal place of business
in 7[India].]
(3) The date on which the notice referred to in sub‑section (2) is delivered
to the insurer shall regulate the priority of all claims under a transfer or
assignment as between persons interested in the policy; and where there is
more than one instrument of transfer or assignment the priority of the claims
under such instruments shall be governed by the order in which the notices
referred to in sub-section (2) are delivered.
(4) Upon the receipt of the notice referred to in sub‑section (2), the insurer
shall record the fact of such transfer or assignment together with the date
thereof and the name of the transferee or the assignee and shall, on the
request of the person by whom the notice was given, or of the transferee or
assignee, on payment of a fee not exceeding one rupee, grant a written
acknowledgement of the receipt of such notice; and any such acknowledgement
shall be conclusive evidence against the insurer that he has duly received the
notice to which such acknowledgement relates.
(5) 8[Subject to the terms and conditions of the transfer or assignment, the
insurer shall, from the date of receipt of the notice referred to in
sub‑section (2),] recognise the transferee or assignee named in the notice as
the only person entitled to benefit under the policy, and such person shall be
subject to all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor
was subject at the date of the transfer or assignment and may institute any
proceedings in relation to the policy without obtaining the consent of the
transferor or assignor or making him a party to such proceedings. 9[(6) Any
rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a policy of life insurance
under an assignment or transfer effected prior to the commencement of this Act
shall not be affected by the provisions of this section.]
(7) Notwithstanding any law or custom having the force of law to the contrary,
an assignment in favour of a person made with the condition that it shall be
inoperative or that the interest shall pass to some other person on the
happening of a specified event during the 10[lifetime of the person whose life
is insured], and an assignment in favour of the survivor or survivors of a
number of persons, shall be valid.
39 Nomination by policy-holder. —
(1) The holder of a policy of life insurance 419 [on his own life 420 [***]]
may, when effecting the policy or at any time before the policy matures for
payment, nominate the person or persons to whom the money secured by the
policy shall be paid in the event of his death: 421 [Provided that, where any
nominee is a minor, it shall be lawful for the policy-holder to appoint in the
prescribed manner any person to receive the money secured by the policy in the
event of his death during the minority of the nominee.]
(2) Any such nomination in order to be effectual shall, unless it is
incorporated in the text of the policy itself, be made by an endorsement on
the policy communicated to the insurer and registered by him in the records
relating to the policy and any such nomination may at any time before the
policy matures for payment be cancelled or changed by an endorsement or a
further endorsement or a will, as the case may be, 419 [but unless notice in
writing of any such cancellation or change has been delivered to the insurer,
the insurer shall not be liable for any payment under the policy made bona
fide by him to a nominee mentioned in the text of the policy or registered in
records of the insurer].
422 [(3) The insurer shall furnish to the policy-holder a written
acknowledgement of having registered a nomination or a cancellation or change
thereof, and may charge a fee not exceeding one rupee for registering such
cancellation or change.]
(4) A transfer or assignment of a policy made in accordance with section 38
shall automatically cancel a nomination: 423 [Provided that the assignment, of
a policy to the insurer who bears the risk on the policy at the time of the
assignment, in consideration of a loan granted by that insurer on the security
of the policy within its surrender value, or its reassignment on repayment of
the loan shall not cancel a nomination, but shall affect the rights of the
nominee only to the extent of the insurer's interest in the policy.]
(5) Where the policy matures for payment during the 424 [lifetime of the
person whose life is insured] or where the nominee or, if there are more
nominees than one, all the nominees die before the policy matures for payment,
the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to the policy-holder or his
heirs or legal representatives or the holder of a succession certificate, as
the case may be.
(6) Where the nominee or, if there are more nominees than one, a nominee or
nominees survive the 425 [person whose life is insured], the amount secured by
the policy shall be payable to such survivor or survivors.
(7) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any policy of life
insurance to which section 6 of the Married Women's Property Act, 1874 (3 of
1874) applies 426 [or has at any time applied: Provided that where a
nomination made whether before or after the commencement of the Insurance
(Amendment) Act, 1946, in favour of the wife of the person who has insured his
life or of his wife and children or any of them is expressed, whether or not
on the face of the policy, as being made under this section, the said section
6 shall be deemed not to apply or not to have applied to the policy.]
40. Prohibition of payment by way of commission or otherwise for procuring business.—
(1) No person shall, after the expiry of six months from the commencement of
this Act, pay or contract to pay any remuneration or reward whether by way of
commission or otherwise for soliciting or procuring insurance business in
India to any person 1[except an insurance agent or an intermediary or
insurance intermediary]. 2[(1A) In this section and sections 3[40A], 41 and
43, reference to an insurance agent shall be construed as including reference
to an individual soliciting or procuring insurance business exclusively in
4[the territories which, immediately before the 1st November, 1956, were
comprised in a Part B State] notified in this behalf by the Central Government
in the Official Gazette and holding a valid licence as insurance agent under
the law of 5[that Part B State].]

part of the abstract referred to in section 15 as a result of an actuarial

52. Prohibition of business on dividing principle.—1[
(1) ] No insurer shall after the commencement of this Act begin, or after
three years from that date continue to carry on, any business upon the
dividing principle, that is to say, on the principle that the benefit secured
by a policy is not fixed but depends either wholly or partly on the results of
a distribution of certain sums amongst policies becoming claims within certain
time‑limits, or on the principle that the premiums payable by a policy‑holder
depend wholly or partly on the number of policies becoming claims within
certain time‑limits: Provided that nothing in this section shall be deemed to
prevent an insurer from allocating bonuses to holders of policies of life
insurance as a result of a periodical actuarial valuation either as
reversionary additions to the sums insured or as immediate cash bonuses or
otherwise: Provided further that an insurer who continues to carry on
insurance business on the dividing principle after the commencement of this
Act shall withhold from distribution a sum of not less than forty per cent. of
the premiums received during each year after the commencement of this Act in
which such business is continued so as to make up the amount required for
investment under section 27. 2[(2) On the expiry of the period of three years
referred to in sub‑section (1), or on the insurer’s ceasing before such expiry
but at any time after the commencement of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1941
to carry on business on the dividing principle, the insurer shall forthwith
cause an investigation to be made by an actuary, who shall determine the
amount accumulated out of the contributions received from the holders of all
policies to which the dividing principle applies and the extent of the claims
of those policy‑holders against the realisable assets of the insurer, and
shall, before the expiration of six months from the date on which he is
entrusted with the investigation, make recommendations regarding the
distribution, whether by cash payments or by the allocation of paid-up
policies or by a combination of both methods, of such assets as he finds to
appertain to such policy‑holders; and the insurer shall, before the expiry of
six months from the date on which the actuary makes his recommendations,
distribute such assets in accordance with those recommendations.
(3) Where at any time prior to the commencement of the Insurance (Amendment)
Act, 1941, an insurer has ceased to carry on business on the dividing
principle, the insurer shall, before the expiration of two months from the
commencement of that Act, report to the 3[Authortiy] the measures taken or
proposed by him for the distribution among holders of policies to which the
dividing principle applies of the assets due to them; and the 3[Authority] may
either sanction such measures or refuse 4[its] sanction, and, if 5[it] refuses
4[its] sanction or if the insurer does not report to 6[it] as required by this
sub‑section, the provisions of sub‑section (2) shall apply to the insurer
forthwith.]
1[52A. When Administrator for management of insurance business may be
appointed.—
(1) If at any time the 2[Authority] has reason to believe that an insurer
carrying on life insurance business is acting in a manner likely to be
prejudicial to the interests of holders of life insurance policies, 3[it] may,
after giving such opportunity to the insurer to be heard as 3[it] thinks fit,
make a report thereon to the Central Government.
(2) The Central Government, if it is of opinion after considering the report
that it is necessary or proper to do so, may appoint an Administrator to
manage the affairs of the insurer under the direction and control of the
4[Authority].
(3) The Administrator shall receive such remuneration as the Central
Government may direct and the Central Government may at any time cancel the
appointment and appoint some other person as Administrator.
(4) The management of the business of the insurer shall as on and after the
date of appointment of the Administrator vest in such Administrator, but
except with the leave of the 2[Authority] the Administrator shall not issue
any further policies.
(5) As on and after the date of appointment of the Administrator any person
vested with any such management immediately prior to that date shall be
divested of that management.
(6) The 4[Authority] may issue such directions to the Administrator as to his
powers and duties as 3[it] deems desirable in the circumstances of the case,
and the Administrator may apply to the 4[Authority] at any time for
instructions as to the manner in which he shall conduct the management of the
business of the insurer or in relation to any matter arising in the course of
such management.]
1[52B. Powers and duties of the Administrator.—
(1) The Administrator shall conduct the management of the business of the
insurer with the greatest economy compatible with efficiency and shall, as
soon as may be possible, file with the 2[Authority] a report stating which of
the following courses is in the circumstances most advantageous to the general
interests of the holders of life insurance policies, namely:—
(a) the transfer of the business of the insurer to some other insurer;
(b) the carrying on of its business by the insurer (whether with the policies
of the business continued for the original sum insured with the addition of
bonuses that attach to the policies or for reduced amounts);
(c) the winding up of the insurer; and
(d) such other course as he deems advisable.
(2) On the filing of the report with the 2[Authority], the 2[Authority] may
take such action as 3[it] thinks fit for promoting the interests of the
holders of life insurance policies in general.
(3) Any order passed by the 2[Authority] under sub‑section (2) shall be
binding on all persons concerned, and shall have effect notwithstanding
anything in the memorandum or articles of association of the insurer, of a
company.
1[52BB. Powers of Administrator respecting property liable to attachment under
section 106.—
(1) If the Administrator is satisfied that any person has rendered himself
liable to be proceeded against under section 106, he may, pending the
institution of proceedings against such person under that section, by order in
writing, prohibit him or any other person from transferring or otherwise
disposing of any property which, in the opinion of the Administrator, would be
liable to attachment in proceedings under that section.
(2) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the Administrator under sub-
section (1) may, within fourteen days from the date on which the order is
served on him, appeal against such order to the Central Government and the
Central Government may pass such order thereon as it thinks fit.
(3) An order made by the Administrator under sub‑section (1) shall, subject to
any other order made by the Central Government on appeal, be in force for a
period of three months from the date of the order unless, before the expiry of
the said period, an application is made under sub‑section (1) of section 106
to the court competent to exercise jurisdiction under that sub‑section, and
when such an application is made, the order shall, subject to any order made
by that court, continue in force as if it were an order of attachment made by
that court in proceedings under that section.
(4) An order made by the Administrator under this section shall,—
(a) in the case of an order affecting a corporation or firm, be served in the
manner provided for the service of summons in rule 2 of Order XXIX or rule 3
of Order XXX, as the case may be, in the First Schedule to the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), and

(iii) where the person cannot be found, by leaving a copy of the order with
some adult male member of his family or by affixing such copy to some
conspicuous part of the premises in which he is known to have last resided or
carried on business or personally worked for gain, and every such order shall
also be published in the Official Gazette.
(5) If any question arises whether a person was duly served with an order
under sub‑section (4), the publication of the order in the Official Gazette
shall be conclusive proof that the order was so served, and a failure to
comply with the provisions of clause (a) or clause (b) of sub‑section (4)
shall not affect the validity of the order.
(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, any property in
respect of which an order has been made by the Administrator may, with the
previous permission of the Administrator and subject to such terms and
conditions as he may impose, be transferred or otherwise disposed of.

of the whole body of shareholders and holding not less than one-tenth of the
whole share capital or by not less than fifty policy-holders holding policies
of life insurance that have been in force for not less than three years and

(b) if the 563 [Authority], who is hereby authorised to do so, applies in this
behalf of the 562 [Tribunal] on any of the following grounds, namely:—
(i) that the company has failed to deposit or to keep deposited with the
Reserve Bank of India the amounts required by section 7 564 [or section 98],
(ii) that the company having failed to comply with any requirement of this Act
has continued such failure 565 [or having contravened any provision of this
Act has continued such contravention] for a period of three months after
notice of such failure 565 [or contravention] has been conveyed to the company
by the 566 [Authority],
(iii) that it appears from 567 [any returns or statements] furnished under the
provisions of this Act or from the results of any investigation made
thereunder that the 568 [company is, or is deemed to be insolvent], or
(iv) that the continuance of the company is prejudicial to the interest of the
policy-holders 569 [or to the public interest generally].
570 [ 53A Unpaid-up share capital. —Notwithstanding anything contained in any
other law, in ascertaining for any purpose of this Act the solvency or
otherwise of an insurer no account shall be taken of any assets of the insurer
consisting of unpaid-up share capital.]
54. Voluntary winding up.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the 1[Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956)], an insurance company shall not be wound up voluntarily except for the purpose of affecting an amalgamation or a re‑construction of the company, or on the ground that by reason of its liabilities it cannot continue its business.
55. Valuation of liabilities.—
(1) In the winding up of an insurance company or in the insolvency of any
other insurer the value of the assets and the liabilities of the insurer shall
be ascertained in such manner and upon such basis as the liquidator or
receiver in insolvency thinks fit, subject, so far as applicable, to the rule
contained in the 1[Seventh Schedule] and to any directions which may be given
by the court.
(2) For the purposes of any reduction by the 2[Tribunal] of the amount of the
contracts of any insurance company the value of the assets and liabilities of
the company and all claims in respect of policies issued by it shall be
ascertained in such manner and upon such basis as the 2[Tribunal] thinks
proper having regard to the aforesaid.
(3) The rule in the 1[Seventh Schedule] shall be of the same force and may be
repealed, altered or amended as if it were a rule made in pursuance of
3[section 643 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956)], and rules may be made
under that section for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of
this Act with respect to the winding up of insurance companies.
56. Application of surplus assets of life insurance fund in liquidation or insolvency.—
(1) In the winding up of an insurance company and in the insolvency of any
other insurer the value of the assets and the liabilities of the insurer in
respect of life insurance business shall be ascertained separately from the
value of any other assets or any other liabilities of the insurer and no such
assets shall be applied to the discharge of any liabilities other than those
in respect of life insurance business except in so far as those assets exceed
the liabilities in respect of life insurance business.
(2) In the winding up of an insurance company carrying on the business of life
insurance or in the insolvency of any other insurer carrying on such business
where any proportion of the profits of the insurer was before the commencement
of the winding up or insolvency allocated to policy-holders if, when the
assets and liabilities of the insurer have been ascertained, there is found to
be a surplus of assets over liabilities (hereinafter referred to as a prima
facie surplus) there shall be added to the liabilities of the insurer in
respect of the life insurance business an amount equal to such proportion of
the prima facie surplus as is equivalent to such proportion of the profits
allocated to shareholders and policy‑holders as was allocated to policy-
holders during the ten years immediately preceding the commencement of the
winding up and the assets of the insurer shall be deemed to exceed his
liabilities only in so far as those assets exceed those liabilities after such
addition: Provided that—
(a) if in any case there has been no such allocation or if it appears to the
1[Tribunal] that by reason of special circumstances it would be inequitable
that the amount to be added to the liabilities of the insurer in respect of
the life insurance business should be an amount equal to such proportion as
aforesaid, the amount to be so added shall be such amount as the 1[Tribunal]
may direct, and
(b) for the purpose of the application of this sub‑section to any case where
before the commencement of the winding up or insolvency a proportion of such
profits as aforesaid of a branch only of the life insurance business in
question has been allocated to policy‑holders, the value of the assets and
liabilities of the insurer in respect of that branch shall be separately
ascertained in like manner as the value of his assets and liabilities in
respect of the life insurance business was ascertained, and the surplus so
found, if any, of assets over liabilities shall, for the purpose of
determining the amount to be added to the liabilities of the insurer in
respect of the life insurance business be deemed to be the prima facie
surplus.

(1) Where the insurance business or any part of the insurance business of an
insurance company has been transferred to another insurance company under an
arrangement in pursuance of which the first mentioned company (in this section
referred to as the secondary company) or the creditors thereof has or have
claims against the company to which such transfer was made (in this section
referred to as the principal company) then, if the principal company is being
wound up by 1[***], the 2[Tribunal] shall (subject as hereinafter mentioned)
order the secondary company to be wound up in conjunction with the principal
company and may by the same or any subsequent order appoint the same person to
be liquidator for the two companies and make provision for such other matters
as may seem to the 2[Tribunal] necessary with a view to the companies being
wound up as if they were one company.
(2) The commencement of the winding up of the principal company shall, save as
otherwise ordered by the 2[Tribunal], be the commencement of the winding up of
the secondary company.
(3) In adjusting the rights and liabilities of the members of the several
companies among themselves the 2[Tribunal] shall have regard to the
constitution of the companies and to the arrangements entered into between the
companies in the same manner as the 2[Tribunal] has regard to the rights and
liabilities of different classes of contributories in the case of winding up
of a single company or as near thereto as circumstances admit.
(4) Where any company alleged to be secondary is not in process of being wound
up at the same time as the principal company to which it is alleged to be
secondary, the 2[Tribunal] shall not direct the secondary company to be wound
up, unless, after hearing all objections (if any) that may be urged by or on
behalf of the company against its being wound up, the 2[Tribunal] is of
opinion that the company is secondary to the principal company and that the
winding up of the company in conjunction with the principal company is just
and equitable.
(5) An application may be made in relation to the winding up of any secondary
company in conjunction with the principal company by any creditor of, or
person interested in, the principal or secondary company.
(6) Where a company stands in the relation of a principal company to one
insurance company and in the relation of a secondary company to some other
insurance company or where there are several insurance companies standing in
the relation of secondary companies to one principal company, the 2[Tribunal]
may deal with any number of such companies together or in separate groups as
it thinks most expedient upon the principles laid down in this section.
58. Scheme for partial winding up of insurance companies.—
(1) If at any time it appears expedient that the affairs of an insurance
company in respect of any class of business comprised in the undertaking of
the company should be wound up but that any other class of business comprised
the undertaking should continue to be carried on by the company or be
transferred to another insurer, a scheme for such purposes may be prepared and
submitted for confirmation of the 1[Tribunal] in accordance with the
provisions of this Act.
(2) Any scheme prepared under this section shall provide for the allocation
and distribution of the assets and liabilities of the company between any
classes of business affected (including the allocation of any surplus assets
which may arise on the proposed winding up), for any future rights of every
class of policy‑holders in respect of their policies and for the manner of
winding up any of the affairs of the company which are proposed to be wound up
and may contain provisions for altering the memorandum of the company with
respect to its objects and such further provisions as may be expedient for
giving effect to the scheme.
(3) The provisions of this Act relating to the valuation of liabilities of
insurers in liquidation and insolvency and to the application of surplus
assets of the life insurance fund in liquidation or insolvency shall apply to
the winding up of any part of the affairs of a company in accordance with the
scheme under this section in like manner as they apply in the winding up of an
insurance company, and any scheme under this section may apply with the
necessary modifications any of the provisions of the Indian Companies Act,
1913 (7 of 1913) relating to the winding up of companies.
(4) An order of the 2[Tribunal] confirming a scheme under this section whereby
the memorandum of a company is altered with respect to its objects shall as
respects the alteration have effect as if it were an order confirmed under
section 12 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), and the provisions
of sections 15 and 16 of that Act shall apply accordingly. 3[***]
59. Return of deposits.—In the winding up of an insurance company 1[(otherwise than in a case to which section 58 applies)] and in the insolvency of any other insurer the liquidator or assignee as the case may be shall apply to the 2[Tribunal] for an order for the return of the 3[deposit made by the company or the insurer, as the case may be, under section 7 or section 98] and the 2[Tribunal] shall on such application order a return of the deposit subject to such terms and conditions as it shall direct.
60. Notice of policy values.—In the winding up of an insurance company for the purposes of a cash distribution of the assets and in the insolvency of any other insurer the liquidator or assignee as the case may be in the case of all persons appearing by the books of the company or other insurer to be entitled to or interested in the policies granted by the company or other insurer shall ascertain the value of the liability of the company or other insurer to each such person and shall give notice of such value to those persons in such manner as the 1[Tribunal] may direct and any person to whom notice is so given shall be bound by the value so ascertained unless he gives notice of his intention to dispute such value in such manner and within such time as may be specified by a rule or order of the 1[Tribunal].

(1) Where an insurance company is in liquidation or any other insurer is
insolvent the 586 [Tribunal] may make an order reducing the amount of the
insurance contracts of the company or other insurer upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as the 586 [Tribunal] thinks just.
(2) Where a company carrying on the business of life insurance has been proved
to be insolvent, the 586 [Tribunal] may if it thinks fit in place of making a
winding up order reduce the amount of the insurance contracts of the company
upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the 586 [Tribunal] thinks
fit.
(3) Application for an order under this section may be made either by the
liquidator or by or on behalf of the company or by a policy-holder, or by the
587 [Authority] and by any person whom the 586 [Tribunal] thinks likely to be
affected shall be entitled to be heard on any such application.

appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

without the written permission of the concerned organisation.

thereof (hereafter in this section referred to an existing trust), the monies

Advisory Committee in the prescribed manner; and in case of any dispute
regarding such apportionment, the decision of the Central Government thereon

which is in favour of that Committee or that Council, shall be of as full
force and effect against or in favour of the Advisory Committee and may be

the suit, appeal or other proceeding may be continued, prosecuted or enforced
by or against the Advisory Committee.
64UH. Employees, etc., to continue.—
(1) Every whole‑time employee of the Tariff Committee, or the Regional
Councils who was employed by that Committee or those Councils wholly or mainly
in connection with its or their statutory duties immediately before the
commencement of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1968, shall, on and from such
commencement, become an employee of the Advisory Committee and shall hold his
office in it by the same tenure, at the same remuneration, and upon the same
terms and conditions and with the same rates and privileges as to pension,
gratuity and other matters as he would have held on such commencement if this
Part had not been enacted, and shall continue to do so until his employment
under the Advisory Committee is terminated or until his remuneration, terms
and conditions, are duly altered by the Advisory Committee: Provided that
nothing contained in this sub‑section shall apply to any employee who has

(2) Where the Central Government is satisfied that for the purpose of securing
uniformity in the scales of pay, remuneration and other terms and conditions
of service applicable to employees of the Tariff Committee, or the Regional
Councils, it is necessary so to do, or that a reduction in the remuneration
payable or revision of the other terms and conditions of service applicable to
employees or any class of them is called for, the Central Government may,
notwithstanding anything contained in sub‑section (1), or in the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947), or in any other law for the time being in
force or in any award, settlement, or agreement for the time being in force,
alter (whether by way of reduction or otherwise) the remuneration and other
terms and conditions of service to such extent and in such manner as it thinks
fit; and if the alteration is not acceptable to any employee, the Advisory
Committee may terminate his employment by giving him compensation equivalent
to three months’ remuneration, unless the contract of service with such
employees provides for a shorter notice of termination. Explanation.—The
compensation payable to an employee under this sub-section shall be in
addition to, and shall not affect any pension, gratuity, provident fund money
or any other benefit to which the employee may be entitled under his contract
of service.
(3) If any question arises as to whether any person was a wholetime employee
of the Tariff Committee, or the Regional Council, on the commencement of the
Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1968, or as to whether any employee was employed
wholly or mainly in connection with the statutory duties of the Tariff
Committee, or any Regional Council immediately before such commencement, the
question shall be referred to the Central Government whose decision thereon
shall be final.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
(14 of 1947), or in any other law for the time being in force, the transfer of
the services of any employee of the Tariff Committee, or the Regional

any compensation under that Act or other law, and no such claim shall be
entertained by any court, Tribunal or other authority.
64UI. Duty of person having custody or control of property to deliver such
property to the Advisory Committee.—
(1) Where any property of the Tariff Committee, or the Regional Councils

the Advisory Committee for advice, and in addition, every Regional Committee
shall perform such other functions as may be delegated to it by the Advisory
Committee by regulations made by it with the previous approval of the Central
Government.

section, any Regional Committee or any sub‑committee thereof restrains an
insurance agent from procuring or causing to be procured general insurance
business in any area, such agent may prefer an appeal to the 2[Authority]
against such order within thirty days from the date of service of that order
on him and the 2[Authority] may, after giving such agent an opportunity of
being heard, pass such orders thereon as it may think fit and the orders made

shall, until it is abolished by the Advisory Committee, be deemed to be a
Regional Committee or sub‑committee as the case may be, established in
accordance with the provisions of this section and shall function as such and

re‑insurance accepted by him in India in the preceding year and in the case of
any other insurer, one per cent. of the total gross premium written direct by

64UL. Power to remove difficulties.—If any difficulty arises in giving effect
to the provisions of this Part, the Central Government may, by order, make

1[Authority].
(B) Every person who intends to act as a surveyor, or loss assessor after the

(Amendment) Act, 1968 2[but before the commencement of the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999], shall make an application to

of such fee, not exceeding rupees two hundred and fifty, as may be prescribed.
2[(BA) Every person who intends to act as a surveyor or loss assessor after
the expiry of a period of one year from the commencement of the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999, shall make an application to
the Authority within such time, in such manner and on payment of such fee as
may be determined by the regulations made by the Authority: Provided that any
licence issued immediately before the commencement of the Insurance Regulatory
and Development Authority Act, 1999 shall be deemed to have been issued in
accordance with the regulations providing for such licence.]
(C) Every licence issued under this section shall remain in force, unless
cancelled earlier, for a period of five years from the date of issue thereof,
and may be renewed for a period of five years at a time, on payment of such
fee, not exceeding rupees two hundred, 3[as may be determined by the

(ii) the applicant, where he is a company or firm, satisfies the 3[Authority]
that all his directors or partners, as the case may be, possess one or more of

(E) Every application for the renewal of the licence shall be made at least
thirty days before the expiry of the period of validity thereof.
(F) The 3[Authority] may, if he is satisfied that any licence issued or
renewed under this section has been lost or destroyed, issue a duplicate
licence on payment of a fee of rupees five and the duplicate licence so issued
shall remain in force for the remainder of the period of validity of the
licence in lieu of which it is issued.
(G) Without prejudice to the powers conferred by sub‑section (7), the
3[Authority], if satisfied that the holder of any licence has made a statement
which is false in material particulars with regard to his eligibility for
obtaining such licence or has, after the issue or renewal of such licence,
acquired any of the disqualifications mentioned in sub‑section (4) of section
42, may, after giving a reasonable opportunity to the holder of such licence
of being heard, by order cancel such licence and notify such cancellation in
the Official Gazette. 7[(1A) Every surveyor and loss assessor shall comply
with the code of conduct in respect of their duties, responsibilities and
other professional requirements as may be specified by the regulations made by
the Authority.]
(2) No claim in respect of a loss which has occurred in India and requiring to
be paid or settled in India equal to or exceeding twenty thousand rupees in
value on any policy of insurance, arising or intimated to an insurer at any
time after the expiry of a period of one year from the commencement of the
Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1968, shall, unless otherwise directed by the
8[Authority], be admitted for payment or settled by the insurer unless he has
obtained a report, on the loss that has occurred, from a person who holds a
licence issued under this section to act as a surveyor or loss assessor
(hereafter referred to as “approved surveyor or loss assessor”): Provided that
nothing in this sub‑section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the right
of the insurer to pay or settle any claim at any amount different from the
amount assessed by the approved surveyor or loss assessor.
(3) The 8[Authority] may, at any time, in respect of any claim of the nature
referred to in sub‑section (2), call for an independent report from any other
approved surveyor or loss assessor specified by 9[it] and such surveyor or
loss assessor shall furnish such report to the 8[Authority] within such time
as may be specified by the 8[Authority] or if no time limit has been specified
by 9[it] within a reasonable time and the cost of, or incidental to such
report shall be borne by the insurer.
(4) The 8[Authority] may, on receipt of a report referred to in sub‑section
(3), issue such directions as it may consider necessary with regard to the
settlement of the claim including any direction to settle a claim at a figure
less than, or more than, that at which it is proposed to settle it or it was
settled and the insurer shall be bound to comply with such directions:
Provided that where the 8[Authority] issues a direction for settling a claim
at a figure lower than that at which it has already been settled, the insurer
shall be deemed to comply with such direction if he satisfies the 8[Authority]
that all reasonable steps, with due regard to the question whether the
expenditure involved is not disproportionate to the amount required to be
recovered, have been taken with due despatch by him: Provided further that no
direction for the payment of a lesser sum shall be made where the amount of
the claim has already been paid and the 8[Authority] is of opinion that the
recovery of the amount paid in excess would cause undue hardship to the
insured: Provided also that nothing in this section shall relieve the insurer
from any liability, civil or criminal, to which he would have been subject but
for the provisions of this sub‑section.
(5) No insurer shall, after the expiry of a period of one year from the
commencement of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1968, pay to any person any fee
or remuneration for surveying, verifying or reporting on a claim of loss under
a policy of insurance unless the person making such survey, verification or
report is an approved surveyor or loss assessor.
(6) Where, in the case of a claim of less than twenty thousand rupees in value
on any policy of insurance it is not practicable for an insurer to employ an
approved surveyor or loss assessor without incurring expenses disproportionate
to the amount of the claim, the insurer may employ any other person (not being
a person disqualified for the time being for being employed as a surveyor or
loss assessor) for surveying such loss and may pay such reasonable fee or
remuneration to the person so employed as he may think fit.
(7) If the 10[Authority] is satisfied that an approved surveyor or loss
assessor has been guilty of wilfully making a false statement knowing it to be
false or of being knowingly a party to the settlement of a claim in a
fraudulent manner, he may, after giving such surveyor or loss assessor an
opportunity of being heard, cancel the licence issued to him with effect from
such date as may be specified by him and shall notify such cancellation in the
Official Gazette.
(8) Any surveyor or loss assessor whose licence has been cancelled shall not
be eligible for having a licence to act as a surveyor or loss assessor for a
period of three years from the date on which the cancellation is notified in
the Official Gazette.
(9) The 10[Authority] may, in respect of any claim of value of less than
twenty thousand rupees on an insurance policy, if the claim has not been or is
not proposed to be reported upon by a surveyor or loss assessor, direct that
such claim shall be reported upon by an approved surveyor or loss assessor and
where the 10[Authority] makes such direction, the provisions of sub‑sections
(3) and (4) shall apply in respect of such claim.
(10) Where, in relation to any class of claims, the 11[Authority] is satisfied
that it is customary to entrust the work of survey or loss assessment to any
person other than a licensed surveyor or loss assessor, or it is not
practicable to make any survey or loss assessment, it may, by an order
published in the Official Gazette, exempt such class of claims from the
operation of this section.]

and liabilities hereafter mentioned shall be included to the extent indicated,
namely:—

(i) fire and miscellaneous business, 2[50 per cent.],
(ii) marine cargo business, 2[50 per cent.], and

(d) amount due to insurance companies carrying on insurance business, in full;
(e) amounts due to sundry creditors, in full;
(f) provision for taxation, in full; 3[(g) such other liability which may be

Explanation.—In the case of an insurer whose principal place of business or
domicile is outside India, where, in the accounts filed with the public
authority of the country in which the insurer is constituted, incorporated or
domiciled, in respect of marine insurance business, the provisions for
unexpired risks and outstanding claims are not shown separately, the
liabilities under items (b) and (c) of clause (ii) in respect of marine
insurance business shall be taken together at a figure of not less than the
total premium less re‑insurances in respect of that class of business during
the preceding twelve months. 4[(2) Every insurer shall furnish to the
Authority with his returns under section 15 or section 16; as the case may be,
a statement certified by an auditor approved by the Authority in respect of
general insurance business, or an actuary approved by the Authority in respect
of life insurance business, as the case may be, of his assets and liabilities
assessed in the manner required by this section as on the 31st day of March of
the preceding year.
(3) Every insurer shall value his assets and liabilities in the manner
required by this section and in accordance with the regulations which may be
made by the Authority in this behalf.]
64VA. Sufficiency of assets.—
(1) An insurer shall, 1[at all times before the commencement of the Insurance
Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999], maintain an excess of the
value of his assets over the amount of his liabilities of not less than the
amount arrived at as follows (hereafter in this section referred to as the
“relevant amount”), namely:—
(i) in the case of an insurer whose total premium income less re‑insurances in
respect of general insurance business (hereafter in this sub‑section referred
to as the “said income”) in the preceding twelve months did not exceed five
crores of rupees, one‑fifth of the said income subject to a minimum of—
(a) five lakhs of rupees in the case of an insurer who is a co‑operative
society registered under the Co‑operative Societies Act, 1912 (2 of 1912), or
any other law for the time being in force in any State relating to
co‑operative societies, or
(b) ten lakhs of rupees in the case of any other insurer; and
(ii) in the case of an insurer whose said income in the preceding twelve
months exceeded five crores of rupees, the aggregate of one‑fifth of the first
five crores of rupees of the said income and one‑tenth of the amount by which
the said income in the preceding twelve months exceeded five crores of rupees:
Provided that where a number of insurers occupying the status of parent and
subsidiary companies prepare, under the laws of the country of origin of the
parent company, a consolidated balance‑sheet, the provisions of this
sub‑section shall apply to such of them as are not members of any group as if
they constituted a single insurer, subject to the further condition that the
relevant amount shall, in no case, be less than a sum equal to—
(i) the number of such insurers multiplied by ten lakhs of rupees, or
(ii) where all the insurers are co‑operative societies registered under the
Cooperative Societies Act, 1912 (2 of 1912), or any other law for the time
being in force in any State relating to co‑operative societies, the number of
such insurers multiplied by five lakhs of rupees: Provided further that if in
respect of any insurer the Central Government is satisfied that either by
reason of an unfavourable claim experience or because of a sharp increase in
the volume of new business, or for any other reason, compliance with the
provisions of this sub‑section would cause undue hardship to the insurer, it
may direct that for such period and subject to such conditions as it may
specify, the provisions of this sub‑section shall apply to that insurer with
the modification that instead of the proportion of one‑fifth, wherever
mentioned in this sub‑section, such other proportion being not less than
one‑tenth as may be specified by that Government shall be applicable to that
insurer: Provided also that in the case of an insurer carrying on insurance
business at the commencement of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1968, it shall
be sufficient compliance with the provisions of this sub‑section until the
31st December, 1972 or until such subsequent date, not being later than 31st
December, 1976, as the Central Government may, at its discretion, allow for
any particular insurer, if he progressively brings up the excess of the value
of his assets over the amount of his liabilities, in such manner as may be
prescribed, to the relevant amount. 2[(1A) Every insurer shall, at all times,
on or after the commencement of the Insurance Regulatory and Development
Authority Act, 1999, maintain an excess of the value of his assets over the
amount of his liabilities of not less than the amount arrived at as follows
(hereinafter referred to in this section as the “required solvency margin”),
namely:—
(i) in the case of an insurer carrying on life insurance business, the
required solvency margin shall be the higher of the following amounts—
(a) fifty crores of rupees (one hundred crores of rupees in case of
re‑insurers); or
(b) the aggregate sums of the results arrived at in items (I) and (II) stated
below:—
(I) the aggregate of the results arrived at by applying the calculation
described in item (A) below (Step I) and the calculation described in item (B)
below (Step II):
(A) for Step I— (A.1) there shall be taken, a sum equal to a percentage
determined by the regulations not exceeding five per cent. of the mathematical
reserves for direct business and re‑insurance acceptances without any
deduction for re‑insurance cessions; (A.2) the amount of mathematical reserves
at the end of the preceding financial year after the deduction of re‑insurance
cessions shall be expressed as a percentage of the amount of those
mathematical reserves before any such deduction; and (A.3) the sum mentioned
in item (A.1) above shall be multiplied— (A.3.1) where the percentage arrived
at under item (A.2) above is greater than eighty‑five per cent. (or in the
case of a re‑insurer carrying on exclusive re‑insurance business, fifty per
cent.), by that greater percentage; and (A.3.2) in any other case, by
eighty‑five per cent. (or in the case of a re‑insurer carrying on exclusive
re‑insurance business, by fifty per cent.);
(B) for Step II— (B.1) there shall be taken, a sum equal to a percentage
determined by the regulations made by the Authority not exceeding one per
cent. of the sum at risk for the policies on which the sum at risk is not a
negative figure, and (B.2) the amount of sum at risk at the end of the
preceding financial year for policies on which the sum at risk is not a
negative figure after the deduction of re‑insurance cession shall be expressed
as a percentage of the amount of that sum at risk before any such deduction,
and (B.3) the sum arrived at under item (B.1) above shall be multiplied—
(B.3.1) where the percentage arrived at under item (B.2) above is greater than
fifty per cent. by that greater percentage; and (B.3.2) in any other case. by
fifty per cent.
(II) a percentage determined by the regulations made by the Authority of the
value of assets determined in accordance with the provisions of section 64V;
(ii) in the case of an insurer carrying on general insurance business, the
required solvency margin, shall be the highest of the following amounts:—
(a) fifty crores of rupees (one hundred crores of rupees in case of
re‑insurer); or
(b) a sum equivalent to twenty per cent. of net premium income; or
(c) a sum equivalent to thirty per cent. of net incurred claims, subject to
credit for re‑insurance in computing net premiums and net incurred claims
being actual but a percentage, determined by the regulations not exceeding
fifty per cent: Provided that if in respect of any insurer, the Authority is
satisfied that either by reason of an unfavourable claim experience or because
of sharp increase in the volume of the business, or for any other reason,
compliance with the provisions of this sub‑section would cause undue hardship
to the insurer, the Authority may direct, for such period and subject to such
conditions, such solvency margin not being less than the lower of the amount
mentioned in sub‑clause (i) or sub‑clause (ii) above, as the case may be.
Explanation.—For the purpose of this sub‑section, the expressions—
(i) “mathematical reserves” means the provision made by an insurer to cover
liabilities (excluding liabilities which have fallen due and liabilities
arising from deposit back arrangement in relation to any policy whereby an
amount is deposited by re‑insurer with the cedant) arising under or in
connection with policies or contracts for life insurance business.
Mathematical reserves also include specific provision for adverse deviations
of the bases, such as mortality and morbidity rates, interest rates, and
expense rates, and any explicit provisions made, in the valuation of
liabilities, in accordance with the regulations made by the Authority for this
purpose;
(ii) “net incurred claims” means the average of the net incurred claims during
the specified period of not exceeding three preceding financial years;
(iii) “sum at risk”, in relation to a life insurance policy, means a sum which
is—
(a) in any case in which an amount is payable in consequence of death other
than a case falling within sub‑clause (b) below, the amount payable on death,
and
(b) in any case in which the benefit under the policy in question consists of
the making, in consequence of death, of the payments of annuity, payment of a
sum by instalments or any other kind of periodic payments, the present value
of that benefit, less in either case the mathematical reserves in respect of
the relevant policies.]
(2) An insurer who does not comply with the provisions of sub‑section (1)
shall be deemed to be insolvent and may be wound up by the court. 3[(2A) If,
at any time an insurer does not maintain the required solvency margin in

holder or some other person.
(4) Every person or body of persons for the time being registered as a
provident society under the Provident Insurance Societies Act, 1912 (5 of

the 671 [Authority] for permission to continue carrying on its business with a
view meanwhile to reorganise its business in accordance with the provisions of
this Act, the 671 [Authority] may at 672 [its] discretion, with due regard to
the past history of the society, permit the society to continue business for a
period not exceeding two years from the date of receipt of such permission, so
however that no new business on the dividing principle is undertaken by the
society.

a provident society is to be wound up in pursuance of this section, or where,
whether before or after the commencement of that Act, a provident society

prescribed fee] for registration being not more than two hundred rupees].
(3) The 682 [Authority] may refuse to issue a certificate of registration
until 683 [it] is satisfied that the rules of the society comply with the
provisions of this Act and that 684 [society complies with the provisions of
sections 685 [65A, 67,] 71, 72, 73 and 73A], but if he is so satisfied he
shall register the society and its rules.
(4) The 682 [Authority] may, after giving previous notice in writing in such
manner as 683 [it] thinks fit specifying the grounds for the proposed
cancellation, and allowing the society concerned an opportunity of being
heard, apply to the Court and obtain sanction for cancellation of the
registration made under this section or made under the provisions of the
Provident Insurance Societies Act, 1912 (5 of 1912)—
(a) if 683 [it] is satisfied 686 [from the returns furnished under the
provisions of this Act or] as the result of an inquiry made under section 87—
(i) that the society is insolvent or is likely to become so, or
(ii) that the business of the society is conducted fraudulently or not in

688 [***]
(c) if the society, having failed to comply with any requirement 689 [or
having contravened any provision] of this Act, has continued such failure 689
[or contravention] for a period of one month after notice of such failure 689
[or contravention] has been conveyed to the society by the 682 [Authority]:
Provided that the 690 [Authority] may, if 691 [it] thinks fit, instead of
applying for cancellation of the registration under sub-clause (i) of clause
(a) of this sub-section make a recommendation to the court that the contracts
of the society should be reduced in such manner and subject to such conditions
as he may indicate: 692 [Provided further that the 690 [Authority] may,
without previous notice and without application to the court for sanction,—
(a) cancel the registration of a provident society which has failed to have
its registration renewed, or
693 [(aa) cancel the registration of a provident society if any deposit
required by section 73, has not been made, or]
(b) cancel, on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, the registration of
any provident society which applies to it for such cancellation if it is
satisfied that the society has ceased to carry on insurance business and that
all its liabilities in respect of insurance policies are either satisfied or
otherwise provided for, 694 [or]
694 [(c) cancel the registration of a provident society if it has reason to
believe that any claim upon the society arising in India under any policy of
insurance remains unpaid for three months after final judgment in regular
course of law.]]
692 [(5) When a registration is cancelled the provident society shall not,
after the cancellation has taken effect, enter into any new contracts of

provisions of section 88, continue as if the cancellation had not taken place.
(6) Where a registration is cancelled under clause (b) of sub-section (4), 695

society has failed to have its registration renewed, the 690 [Authority] may
at 696 [its] discretion revive the registration of the provident society,
within six months from the date on which the concellation took effect, makes
the deposits required by section 73 695 [or satisfies the 690 [Authority] that
no claim upon it such as is referred to in the said clause (c) remains unpaid]

the case may be, and complies with any directions which may be given to it by
the 690 [Authority].

liability either actual or contingent have been furnished to the actuary for
the purpose of the investigation.
(3) If the actuary finds that the financial condition of the society is such
that no surplus exists for distribution as bonus to the policy‑holders, or as
dividend to the share‑holders, he shall state in his report whether in his
opinion the society is insolvent and, if so, whether it should be wound up or
not, and the extent to which in his opinion existing contracts should be
modified or existing rates of premium should be adjusted to make good the
deficiency in the assets.

certificate has been forwarded to the 4 [Authority].
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply to any alteration of a

opinion that the alteration unfairly affects the interests of existing policy-
holders, prohibit the alteration, and, if 748 [it] does so, the society shall
not put the altered scheme into operation, unless it first discharges to the

the society shall, where its assets are sufficient to meet all existing
liabilities, set apart out of its assets the sum sufficient in the opinion of
the actuary to meet the liabilities incurred under the scheme so 752
[prohibited], and where its assets are not so sufficient, within three months
from the date of the 753 [prohibition], apply to the court for a modification
of its existing contracts or failing such modification for the winding up of

of which 5[a director, manager, managing agent, actuary, officer or partner of
the society is a director, manager, managing agent, actuary, officer or
partner]: 2[Provided that nothing in this sub‑section shall apply to loans
made by a provident society to a banking company: Provided further that where
any event occurs giving rise to circumstances, the existence of which at the
time of the grant of any subsisting loan would have made such grant a
contravention of this sub‑section, such loan shall, notwithstanding any
contract to the contrary, be repaid within three months from the occurrence of
such event or from the commencement of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1946
whichever is later; and in case of default, the director, manager, auditor,
actuary or partner concerned shall without prejudice to any other penalty
which he may incur, cease to hold office in the society on the expiry of the

any Civil Court of competent jurisdiction be recoverable by execution as if a
decree for such amount had been passed by that court. 9[(5) The provisions of
section 86D of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), shall not apply to
a loan granted to a director of a provident society being a company if the
loan is one granted on the security of a policy on which the society bears the
risk and the policy was issued to the director on his own life and the loan is
within the surrender value of the policy.]
86. Inspection of books.—The books of every provident society shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by the 1[Authority] or any person appointed by 2[it] in this behalf by any member or policy‑holder of the society who 3[has, on application in this behalf, been permitted by the 1[Authority] subject to such condition, if any, as 4[it] may impose, to make such inspection].
87 Inquiry by or on behalf of Authority. —

heard, direct such an inquiry to be made by an auditor or actuary appointed by
it 771 [or by both an auditor and an actuary appointed simultaneously, or
first by an auditor only or an actuary only and afterwards by an actuary or
auditor].
(2) For the purposes of any such inquiry 769 [Authority] or the auditor or
actuary, as the case may be, shall be entitled to examine all books and
documents of the society and may demand from the society or any officer of the
society such explanations as he may require on any matter relating to the

other provident society in accordance with a scheme prepared under this
section and sanctioned by the 781 [Authority].
(2) Any scheme prepared under this section shall set out the agreement under
which the transfer or amalgamation is proposed to be effected, and shall
contain such further provisions as may be necessary for giving effect to the
scheme.
(3) Before an application is made to the 781 [Authority] to sanction any such

effect, which date shall not be more than twelve months before the date on
which the application to the 782 [Authority] is made under this section:
Provided that the 782 [Authority] may exempt the provident society or
societies concerned from furnishing to 783 [it] and from keeping open for
inspection any one or more of the above documents.
(4) When any application such as is referred to in sub-section (3) is made to
the 782 [Authority] 3 [it] may require, if for special reasons 784 [it] so
directs, notice of the application to be sent to every person resident 785 [in
India] who is the holder of a policy of any provident society concerned and
may cause a statement of the nature and terms of the amalgamation or transfer,
as the case may be, to be published in such manner and for such periods as 784
[it] may direct, and after hearing the societies concerned, such policy-
holders as apply to be heard and such other persons as 784 [it] may deem fit,

objection to the arrangement has been established and shall make such
consequential orders as are necessary to give effect to the arrangement,
including orders as to the disposal of any deposit made under section 73:
Provided that—
(a) no part of the deposit made by any party to the amalgamation or transfer

sanction the arrangement shall be sent to each of the societies concerned and
to each of the policy-holders who applied to be heard.
(6) If the scheme involves a reduction of the amount of the insurance and
other contracts of the transfer or society or of any or all of the societies
concerned in the amalgamation, the 786 [Authority] may sanction the scheme,
reducing the amount of such contracts upon such terms and subject to such
conditions as 787 [it] may think proper, and the reduction of the contracts as
sanctioned by the 786 [Authority] shall be valid and binding on all the
parties concerned.]
88. Winding up by court and voluntary winding up.—
(1) The court may order the winding up of a provident society being a company
incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), 1[or under the
Indian Companies Act, 1882 (6 of 1882) or under the Indian Companies Act, 1866
(10 of 1866) or under any Act repealed thereby] and the provisions of 2[the
Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913)], shall subject to the provisions of
this Part, apply accordingly. 3[(2) In addition to the grounds on which such
an order may be based, the court may order the winding up of a provident
society if the 4[Authority], who is hereby authorised to do so, applies in
this behalf to the court on any of the following grounds, namely:—
(a) that the registration of the society has been cancelled under sub‑section
(4) of section 70;
(b) that it appears from the returns furnished under the provisions of this
Act or as the result of an inquiry made under section 87 that the society is
insolvent;
(c) that the continuance of the society is prejudicial to the interests of the
policy‑holders.]
(3) A provident society being a company incorporated under the Indian
Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), 1[or under the Indian Companies Act, 1882 (6
of 1882), or under the Indian Companies Act, 1866 (10 of 1866), or under any
Act repealed thereby] may be wound up voluntarily in accordance with the
provisions of 2[the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913)], but shall not be
so wound up except for the purpose of effecting an amalgamation or
reconstruction of the society or on the ground that by reason of its
liabilities it cannot continue its business.
(4) A provident society not being a company incorporated under the Indian
Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), 1[or under the Indian Companies Act, 1882 (6
of 1882), or under the Indian Companies Act, 1866 (10 of 1866), or under any
Act repealed thereby], may be wound up voluntarily under this Act, if a
resolution is passed by proprietors that the society should be wound up
voluntarily for the purpose or on the ground specified in sub‑section (3), and
the 4[Authority] may, in any case where 5[it] has ordered the cancellation of
the registration of a society under sub‑section (4) of section 70, order the
winding up of the society under this Act.
89. Reduction of Insurance contracts.—The court may make an order reducing the amount of the insurance contracts of a provident society upon such terms and subject to such conditions as the court thinks just—
(a) if the 1[Authority] as an alternative to cancelling the registration of a
society under sub‑section (4) of section 70 applies to the court in this
behalf;
(b) if while a society is in liquidation the court thinks fit;
(c) if when a society has been proved to be insolvent, the court thinks fit to
do so in place of making an order for the winding up of the society; or
(d) if the court is satisfied on an application made in this behalf by the
society supported by the report of an actuary, and after giving the
policy‑holders an opportunity to be heard that it is desirable to do so.
90 Appointment of liquidator. —
(1) Where a provident society is to be wound up whether under the Indian
Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913) or under this Act, the society shall, within

the passing of the resolution authorising the winding up, as the case may be
give notice thereof to the 795 [Authority], and, except where the winding up
is done by an order of the Court, the 795 [Authority] shall appoint the
liquidator and shall determine the remuneration to be paid to him: 796
[Provided that if the 795 [Authority] is not satisfied that the assets of the
society are sufficient to meet the costs of liquidation including the
remuneration of the liquidator, 797 [it] may decline to make such appointment,
and in such a case the society shall itself appoint a liquidator who shall
carry out the liquidation as if the winding up was being done by an order of
the court.]
(2) Any liquidator 798 [appointed by the 795 [Authority] under sub-section
(1)] may be removed by the 795 [Authority] if satisfied that the duties
entrusted to him are not being properly discharged.
1[90A. Application of Act to liquidators.—Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), the
provisions of sections 91, 92 and 93 shall apply to any liquidator appointed

(g) with the sanction of the 804 [Authority] to employ such establishment and

auction or private contract, with power to transfer the whole thereof to any

appointment of a committee of inspection, and, if they so resolve and an
application accordingly is made at any time not later than fourteen days after
the date of the meeting by any creditor appointed for the purpose at the
meeting, 807 [the 808 [Authority] may, if 809 [it] thinks fit, appoint a
suitable person] in place of or jointly with the liquidator already appointed,

the amount so found to each such person in the prescribed manner and each such
person on receiving such notice shall be bound by the value so ascertained.

proceedings at all meetings attended by him, all amounts received or expended
by him and any other matter that may be prescribed, and these books may, with
the sanction of the 812 [Authority] be inspected by any creditor or
contributory.
(11) If the winding up continues for more than a year the liquidator shall
summon a meeting of the creditors and contributories at the end of the first
year and of each succeeding year, and shall lay before them an account of his
acts and dealings and of the conduct of the winding up, and that account
together with any views expressed thereon by the meeting shall be forwarded by
the liquidator 813 [within one week after the meeting] to the 812 [Authority].
(12) So far as is not otherwise provided herein or is not otherwise prescribed
