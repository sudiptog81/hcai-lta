Solutions Pvt Ltd  Appellant (Represented by: Mr. Sandeep Chilana, Mr. Aurica
from using the name of ICANN. They only represent the appellant. In fact they
are reselling the services of registrar being provided by the appellant. After
selling the services of the registrar they remit the money to the appellant as
per the agreement. We find that the agreement is of a nature of principal to
principal basis and resellers cannot be considered as franchisee or associate
franchisor of ICANN.
43\. In fact, we have already held earlier that appellant cannot be considered
as a franchisee of ICANN and therefore resellers cannot be considered as
franchisee of the associate franchisor. In view of the above position, in our
view the Revenues contention that the resellers are providing the franchisee
services of the ICANN does not hold water. In view of the above analysis we do
not find any strength in the second demand notices also. Accordingly we hold
that no service tax is leviable under the franchise service and hence demand
and penalties are not sustainable.
44\. We also note that the appellant has raised certain other arguments.
However, since we are allowing the appeal on the merits, we do not consider it

Date of Hearing : 12.03.2014 Date of Decision: 05.08.2014 ORDER NO..
Per: P.K. Jain
1\. The appellant is engaged in the activity of registration of website domain
names. Any user who need to access a particular website, the users computer
would need to access information from the specific server. This can be done by
identifying each computer on the internet network with a unique identification
which is known as domain name. The domain name identifies the location of a
particular website on the network of millions of computer on the internet. As
an illustration www.google.com means that (i) www is the worldwide web (ii)
com represent the top level domain (TLD) and (iii) google represent the
second level domain. The second level domain can serve requirement of specific
entities like business, company, etc. 2 Data base of all domain name is
required to be maintained. There is a need to link a particular domain name
with a particular computer on the internet protocol. The Registrar are
entities which contract with the registered name holders and the registry and
collects registration data about the registered name holders and submit the
same to the registry for entering in the data base maintained by the registry.
3\. As mentioned earlier, appellant is engaged in the activity of registration
of website domain names i.e. appellant is a registrar. The appellant is also
accredited by International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
for certain top level domains. The appellant is registering domain names
permitted by ICANN and ICANN accredited registries. The appellant is paying
fee as per agreements, fixed and variable to ICANN and various registries (who
are also accredited by ICANN).
4\. The first Show Cause Notice dated 4.2.2011 is issued for the period from
March 2006 to November 2010 and is in respect of the foreign remittance made
by the appellant during the said period to the ICANN and ICANN accredited
registries. The demand is on reverse charge basis.
5\. The appellant has been appointing resellers for worldwide services of
registration, renewal, cancellation, deletion of domain names and has been
collecting charges for the services rendered.
6\. The second Show Cause Notice dated 19.10.2011 is issued for the period
April 2006 to March 2011 and is on account of amounts received by the
appellant during the said period from all the resellers.
7\. Both the demands are confirmed in the impugned order on the reverse charge
basis. Both the demands have been made under the category of franchise
services under Section 65 (105) (zze) of the Finance Act, 1994.
8\. The learned advocate for the appellants main contention is that the
activities carried out by the appellant does not qualify as franchise
services. In support of his contention it is submitted that Section 65 (47) of
the Finance Act, 1994 defines franchisee to mean an agreement by which the
franchisee is granted representational right to sell or manufacture goods or
to provide service or undertake any process identified with franchisor,
whether or not a trade mark, service mark, trade name or logo or any such
symbol, as the case may be, is involved. Further Section 65 (48) of the
Finance Act defines the term franchisor to mean any person who enters in to
franchise with a franchisee and includes any associates of franchisor or a
person designated by franchisor to enter into franchise on his behalf and the
term "franchisee" shall be construed accordingly.
9\. The learned advocate submitted that from the definition of the franchise
services, two import phrases are to be noted i.e. grant of representational
right and identification with the franchisor. Representational right
permits a person to represent himself as someone else to the external world
such that the external world feels that he is procuring the goods or services
from the brand owner which can be termed as franchise right. It was submitted
that in view of this, two important ingredients must be present for franchise
 (a) the franchisee must surrender his own identity; and (b) franchisee must
step into the shoes of the franchisor. The contention of the appellant was
that there is no representational right granted to the appellant by the
alleged franchisor ICANN. Moreover the activity carried out by the appellant
is not identified with the alleged franchiser and therefore no service tax is
payable by the appellant. The appellant is merely accredited as a domain name
registrar. The relationship between ICANN and the registrar is defined by the
agreement between the two. In the said Agreement (i) Sub-clause 2.1 grants the
accreditation to the registrar; (ii) Sub-clause 2.2. permits the registrar to
state that it is accredited by ICANN and to link to pages and documents within
the ICANN website; and (iii) Sub-clause 2.3 deals with general obligations.
10\. The learned advocate for the appellant submitted that the departments
case revolves around clause 2.2 of the agreement. Based on the said sub-clause
2.2, the department contended that the said sub-clause permits the appellant
to use the brand name of ICANN and use of such brand name results in a crucial
branding advantage to the appellant which is not available to an ordinary
registrar and therefore a representational right is granted. The learned
advocate for the appellant contended that there is a huge difference
representing ICANN and stating that the appellant is an ICANN accredited
registrar. The appellant is not even allowed to use the ICANN logo in
isolation. Even the website of the appellant shows the appellants own logo
and identity and shows the ICANN accredited registrar mark. It is apparent
from the website that the appellant conducts business under the brand name of
Public Domain Registry and does not represent itself to be ICANN. The
appellant is only stating that they are accredited by ICANN, and not they are
ICANN. The learned advocate submitted that the situation is similar to a
company certified by ISO. It was contended that to treat the transaction as
franchise, it is important that the franchiser should have granted a
representational right, and the customer should feel that it is the franchiser
who is undertaking the business. These ingredients are not present in this
case.
11\. The other contention of the learned advocate for the appellant was that
their activities cannot be identified with the alleged franchisor i.e. ICANN.
It was submitted that the definition of franchisee service requires that the
goods or services should be identified with the franchisor. This is evident
from the definition as also the clarification issued by the Board vide
Circular F.No. B1/6/2005-TRU dated 27.7.2005. Para 23.3 of the said Circular
states that similarly, if rights are granted for rendering services identified
with the principal on his behalf, such services by the principal to the
service recipient would be taxable. In the present case, the said requirement
is not satisfied. In fact, ICANN is prohibited from entering into the business
of domain name registration. It is only permitted to control and supervise the
said activity. In fact the domain name of ICANN itself is registered by
someone else and not by ICANN itself. It was submitted that the condition of
the product or process being identified with the franchisor is not fulfilled
and hence current arrangement is only that of accreditation and not that of
franchise.
12\. The other contention of the learned advocate for the appellant was that
the agreement entered by the appellant does not indicate any franchisor 
franchisee relationship. It was contended that as per the registrar
accreditation policy any person can apply for accreditation and if the
qualifications are fulfilled he has no right to refuse accreditation.
Moreover, ICANN cannot impose any commercial restrictions and accredited
registrar is free to conduct his business in any manner and under any brand.
These aspects of the agreement are fundamentally different from a franchise
agreement where it is always open for the franchiser to choose a particular
franchisee over another without attributing any specific reasons.
13\. Following points were also submitted:
(a) ICANN does not recognize its receipts as franchise income;
(b) The appellants do not recognize the expense as franchise expense;
(c) Neither ICANNs nor the appellants website refers to either the appellant
as a franchiser or franchisee;
(d) The invoice raised by ICANN does not refer to franchise;
(e) The invoice raised by the appellant to the customer neither contains any
reference to a franchise arrangement nor to any brands or name of ICANN.
14\. It was also submitted that even ICANN has issued letter confirming that
the appellant is not a franchisee and no representational rights have been
granted to the appellant. It was submitted that the appellant has not
surrendered his own identity. It conducts business under its own brand name
and does not step into the shoes of ICANN. The customer is aware it is
approaching the appellant and does not identify the appellant as ICANN.
15\. Following case law were also quoted in support of the contention:
(a) Global Transqene Ltd vs CCE, Aurangabad;
(b) New Mangalore Port Trust Ltd vs CST 2012 (26) ELT STR 155 (Tr-Bang);
(c) Amway India Enterprises Pvt Ltd vs CCE, New Delhi  2013 (31) STR 551;
(d) Franch Express Network (P) Ltd vs CST, Chennai  2008 (12) STR 370 (Tri-
Chennai).
16\. It was contended that in view of the above, the demand of service tax and
all remittance made to ICANN is incorrect and should be dropped.
17\. The other contention of the advocate for the appellant was that
registries are not associate franchisor of ICANN. It was contended that the
demand in the present case is raised on remittance made by the appellant to
registries located abroad by treating the said registries as associate
franchisor. The very fact that ICANN is not a franchisor, it cannot be held
the registry is an associate franchisor. Both registry and registrar are
independent entity operated on principal to principal basis and the rational
contended earlier are equally applicable in the present case also.
18\. The next contention was that the appellant is also not an associate
franchisor of ICANN as alleged in the second Show Cause Notice and is not
rendering franchise service to reseller. It was submitted that neither any
representation right is granted to the appellant by ICANN, nor the appellant
grants any representational right to resellers. It would be anomalous to state
that the appellant is both franchisor and franchisee at the same time. It was
also submitted that reseller agreement entered into by the appellant and its
reseller explicitly prohibited the reseller from displaying the ICANN and
ICANN accredited registrar logo.
19\. In addition to the above contentions on merits it was submitted that part
of the demand is for the period prior to April 18, 2006 and as held by the
Honble Bombay High Court in Indian National Ship Owners Association vs Union
of India  2009 (13) STR235 (Bom). The demands are not sustainable in respect
of import of services.
20\. It was also contended that even if it is assumed that service tax is
payable by the appellant, still no service tax can be demanded on the portion
of services which qualified as export of services in terms of the Export of
Services Rules, 2005. It was submitted that out of the total output turnover
of Rs. 4,73,86,19,240/- only Rs. 88,39,16,786/- is towards the domestic sales
and all the remaining sales are made to the resellers located outside India
and the amount was received in convertible foreign exchange and all other
conditions under Export of Service Rules, 2005 are duly fulfilled.
21\. It was also submitted that assuming that the services provided by ICANN
and registries are taxable, the service provided are outside India. When
registries and ICANN provide such alleged services, the benefit of such
services directly flow to the resellers of appellant outside India and
therefore such services are never received in India and in terms of Import
Rules the services should be received in India and since such services are not
received in India, no service tax can be levied in India. It was also
contended that the benefit of Cenvat Credit should be given to the appellant.
Similarly if at all its activities are held as taxable then cum-duty benefit
is required to be given. It was also contended that the value of services
should only be restricted to yearly accreditation fees. It was submitted that
even if the arrangement is franchise only accreditation fee payable to ICANN
can be taxed under the franchise services. The invoices between a registry and
the appellant shows the fees paid by the appellant to the registry are
categorized as new registration and renewal fees. This amount to fees paid for
actual goods and services and not towards franchise fees. It was also
submitted that all customers of the appellant are not resellers; some of them
are end users and the demand has been made for the total amount and fees from
customers who are end users cannot be considered as franchisee of the
appellant. It was also submitted that certain domain name registries such as
uk, au etc did not have any accreditation or agreement with ICANN and such
registries by no stretch of imagination can be called as associate franchisor
of ICANN. Remittances made to such registries have also been included in the
taxable value. It was also contended that the extended period of limitation
cannot be invoked and in support of the said contention, the Honble Supreme
Courts decision in the case of Uniworth Textiles Ltd vs CCE, Raipur  2013
(288) ELT 161 (SC) and Nizam Sugar Sugar Factory vs CCE, A.P.  2006 (197) ELT
465 (SC) were relied upon.
22\. It was further submitted that ICANN is a not for profit organization
performing a regulatory function of controlling the domain names and does not
provide any service to the registrars and therefore can by no stretch of
imagination can be called as a franchisor. It was also submitted that in the
facts and circumstances of the case no penalty under Sections 76, 77 and 78 of
the Finance act, 1994 can be imposed.
23\. The learned special counsel for the Revenue submitted that the Honble
Supreme in the case of Satyam Infoway Ltd vs Sifynet Solutions Pvt Ltd
reported in AIR 2004 SC 3540 has observed that the original role of a domain
name was no doubt to provide an address for computers on the internet. But the
internet has developed from a mere means of communication to a mode of
carrying on commercial activity and therefore the domain name not only serves
as an address for internet communication but also identifies the specific
internet site. In the commercial field, each domain name owner provides
information/services which are associated with such domain name and thus a
domain name may pertain to provision of services within the meaning of Section
2 (z) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The law enunciated in this regard is that
the domain names are subject to the legal norms applicable to other
intellectual properties such as trade marks.
24\. The learned special counsel for the Revenue thereafter took us through
the agreement between ICANN and the appellant. The said agreement is called
the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA). The appellant is registrar as per
Clause 1.9 and as per clause 1.110 Registrar Services means services
provided by a registrar in connection with a TLD as to which it has been an
agreement with TLDs registry operators and includes contracting with
registered name holders, collecting information about such entities and
submitting the same for entry in the registry database. As per clause 2.2,
ICANN grants to registrar (appellant), a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free
licence  (a) to state that it is accredited by ICANN as a registrar for each
TLD; and (b) to link to pages and documents within the ICANN website. As per
clause 3.1 the appellant will operate as a registrar for each TLD for which it
is accredited by ICANN. Clause 3 lays down various Registrar Obligations and
as per clause 3.3.6 appellant shall provide third-party bulk access to the
data subject to public access for which registrar may charge an annual fee not
to exceed US$ 10,000 for such bulk access. In the Logo licence Appendix it is
stipulated that ICANN grants to registrar a non-exclusive worldwide right and
license to use the trademarks solely in connection with the provision and
marketing of registrar services; however all rights to the trademarks that may
be acquired by the registrar (appellant in this case) shall inure to the
benefit of and assigned to ICANN and registrar shall not assert ownership of
the trademarks or any associated goodwill and registrar shall not sub license
any of its rights to anybody including re-sellers without prior written
approval of ICANN.
25\. The second agreement i.e. between the appellant and the registry was gone
through. The said agreement is between VeriSingn, a Delaware Corporation and
its subsidiaries (VNDS) and the appellant.
ICANN figures in clause 1.2 of this Agreement. As per clause 1.8 the licensed
product refers to the intellectual property required to access the supported
protocol, and to the application programme interfaces an software
collectively. As per clause 2.5, Registrar grants VNDS as Registry a non-
exclusive, non-transferable worldwide limited license to the data elements
consisting of registered name, IP addresses of name servers and identity of
registering registrar for propagation and provision of authorized access to
TLD Zone files permitted or required by VNDS Registry. As per clause 3.1 VNDS
grants registrar a non-exclusive worldwide limited license to use the licensed
product. As per clause 4 there are various support services like engineering
support and customer service support. Clause 5 provides for registration fee
payable by registrar to VNDS, non-refundable fees and monthly registration
fees on the basis of monthly invoices. For a transfer approved by ICANN
registrar agrees to pay VNDS US$ 0 for transport upto 50,000 names or US$
50,000 for more than 50,000 names. There are also provisions for payment of
fees by registrar to VNDS and variable registry level fees paid by VNDS to
ICANN.
26\. The third agreement is Reseller Master Agreement which was gone through
is between appellant and the reseller. In this agreement appellant are the
parent providing various products and services and the re-seller
buying/receiving various parent products and parent services. There are
parent servers and parent website. Clause 1 (25) gives the definition of and
reference to ICANN. Even in the Re-seller Doman Registration Product Agreement
Extension, in clause 1 (4) there is a reference to ICANN. From the definition
of obligations of re-seller and rights of parent, the important and
indispensable role of ICANN is discernible. Appendix B lays down the list of
Top Level Domains that the parent is authorized to provide domain name
registration and management services. Thus the reseller is obligated to get
domain name registration and management services of .com, .net, .org, .biz,
.info though the parent registrar Directi Internet Solutions Pvt Ltd who in
turn are duly authorized by ICANN to provide such registration and management
services.
27\. The learned special counsel submitted that from the three agreements, it
is clear that the services received/provided by the appellant satisfied the
definition of franchisee. It was also submitted that the argument that ICANN
is not engaged in domain registration and hence appellant doing registration
of domain names does not represent ICANN is fallacious as the domain names are
assigned by ICANN and logo, or trade mark of ICANN is allowed to be used by
appellant though the ownership of logo or trade mark continues with ICANN.
ICANN is present in all the three types of agreements and every user of the
domain name assigned to appellant knows that the owner of the domain name is
ICANN. It was submitted that seeming difference is attributable to the
difference between a tangible consumer product and an intangible service of
registration and management of domain names. It was also submitted by the
learned special counsel for the Revenue that the argument that ICANN is
performing a regulatory function and its job is not commerce and profit is of
no consequence as ICANN receives fees which are both fixed and variable.
Similarly fee is received by the appellant, registry as also reseller. If a
regulator registry is engaged in trade and commerce it has to pay the taxes.
The learned special counsel also quoted this Tribunal decision in Delhi Public
School Society vs CST, New Delhi  2013 (32) STR 179 (Tri-Del) where it is
clearly ruled that despite a claimed education joint venture agreement
(without any mention of franchise, franchisor or franchisee), the dominant
component of enterprise was franchise service and despite a temporal transfer
of intangible property and permitting the other party to use the logo, the
service is not intellectual property service but franchise service by virtue
of a raft and bouquet of other services. It was therefore contended that the
ratio of the above decision squarely applies to the facts of the present case.
28\. It was also submitted that the appellants other arguments, benefit of
export services, Cenvat credit, cum-duty benefit, restriction of value of
service to annual accreditation fees are fallacious and cannot be accepted. In
any case, they could have put forward such claims after owning up their
liability to pay tax on franchise service.
29\. It was also submitted that the extended period has been correctly invoked
as the appellant has suppressed this service in their ST 3 Returns despite
Service Tax registration for other two services and their intimate knowledge
of Service Tax law.
30\. It was also contended that interest has been correctly demanded and
penalty has been rightly imposed.
31\. We have considered the rival submissions. We find that both the demand
notices have been issued under the Franchise Service. The terms Franchisee
and Franchiser have been defined under Section 65 (47) and 65 (48) of the
Finance Act, 1994 and at the relevant time are as under:
65 (47) franchise means an agreement by which the franchisee is granted
representational right to sell or manufacture goods or to provide service or
undertake any process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trade mark,
service mark, trade name or logo or any such symbol, as the case may be, is
involved 65 (48) franchisor means any person who enters in to franchise with
a franchisee and includes any associates of franchisor or a person designated
by franchisor to enter into franchise on his behalf and the term "franchisee"
shall be construed accordingly.
32\. It would thus be seen from the above mentioned definitions that
franchisee means an agreement by which the franchisee is granted
representational rights to sell or manufacture goods or to provide service or
undertake any process identified with franchisor. The Revenues case is that
franchisor in the present case is ICANN and the appellants are franchisee. In
order to examine whether the appellants are a franchisee, we examine the
activities of ICANN and thereafter the agreement between ICANN and the
appellants. The appellants have provided a copy of the ICANN Byelaws. Article
I of the said byelaws details the Mission and Core Values of ICANN which are
reproduced below:
ARTICLE I: MISSION AND CORE VALUES Section 1. MISSION The mission of The
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") is to
coordinate, at the overall level, the global Internet's systems of unique
identifiers, and in particular to ensure the stable and secure operation of
the Internet's unique identifier systems. In particular, ICANN:
1\. Coordinates the allocation and assignment of the three sets of unique
identifiers for the Internet, which are a. Domain names (forming a system
referred to as "DNS");
b. Internet protocol ("IP") addresses and autonomous system ("AS") numbers;
and c. Protocol port and parameter numbers.
2\. Coordinates the operation and evolution of the DNS root name server
system.
3\. Coordinates policy development reasonably and appropriately related to
these technical functions.
Section 2. CORE VALUES In performing its mission, the following core values
should guide the decisions and actions of ICANN:
1\. Preserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security,
and global interoperability of the Internet.
2\. Respecting the creativity, innovation, and flow of information made
possible by the Internet by limiting ICANN's activities to those matters
within ICANN's mission requiring or significantly benefiting from global
coordination.
3\. To the extent feasible and appropriate, delegating coordination functions
to or recognizing the policy role of other responsible entities that reflect
the interests of affected parties.
4\. Seeking and supporting broad, informed participation reflecting the
functional, geographic, and cultural diversity of the Internet at all levels
of policy development and decision-making.
5\. Where feasible and appropriate, depending on market mechanisms to promote
and sustain a competitive environment.
6\. Introducing and promoting competition in the registration of domain names
where practicable and beneficial in the public interest.
7\. Employing open and transparent policy development mechanisms that (i)
promote well-informed decisions based on expert advice, and (ii) ensure that
those entities most affected can assist in the policy development process.
8\. Making decisions by applying documented policies neutrally and
objectively, with integrity and fairness.
9\. Acting with a speed that is responsive to the needs of the Internet while,
as part of the decision-making process, obtaining informed input from those
entities most affected.
10\. Remaining accountable to the Internet community through mechanisms that
enhance ICANN's effectiveness.
11\. While remaining rooted in the private sector, recognizing that
governments and public authorities are responsible for public policy and duly
taking into account governments' or public authorities' recommendations.
These core values are deliberately expressed in very general terms, so that
they may provide useful and relevant guidance in the broadest possible range
of circumstances. Because they are not narrowly prescriptive, the specific way
in which they apply, individually and collectively, to each new situation will
necessarily depend on many factors that cannot be fully anticipated or
enumerated; and because they are statements of principle rather than practice,
situations will inevitably arise in which perfect fidelity to all eleven core
values simultaneously is not possible. Any ICANN body making a recommendation
or decision shall exercise its judgment to determine which core values are
most relevant and how they apply to the specific circumstances of the case at
hand, and to determine, if necessary, an appropriate and defensible balance
among competing values.
33\. Article II of the said byelaws details the Powers. Section 2 of the
Article II details restriction and the said Section 2 reads as under:
Section 2. RESTRICTIONS ICANN shall not act as a Domain Name System Registry
or Registrar or Internet Protocol Address Registry in competition with
entities affected by the policies of ICANN. Nothing in this Section is
intended to prevent ICANN from taking whatever steps are necessary to protect
the operational stability of the Internet in the event of financial failure of
a Registry or Registrar or other emergency.
33.1 Now coming to the ICANN, there is an agreement between the appellants and
the ICANN known as Registrar Accreditation Agreement. We have perused a copy
of the said Agreement. The clause 1.1 defines the term Accredit and other
relevant clauses mentioned by the learned Special Counsel for Revenue are
clauses 1.9 and 1.11. These clauses are reproduced below:
"Accredit" means to identify and set minimum standards for the performance of
registration functions, to recognize persons or entities meeting those
standards, and to enter into an accreditation agreement that sets forth the
rules and procedures applicable to the provision of Registrar Services.
1.9 The word "Registrar," when appearing with an initial capital letter,
refers to Directi Internet Solutions d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.Com, a party
to this Agreement.
1.11 "Registrar Services" means services provided by a registrar in connection
with a TLD as to which it has an agreement with the TLD's Registry Operator,
and includes contracting with Registered Name Holders, collecting registration
data about the Registered Name Holders, and submitting registration
information for entry in the Registry Database.
33.2 The other clauses referred by the learned Special Counsel for the Revenue
are clauses 2.2 and 3.1. These two sub-clauses are also reproduced below:
2.2 Registrar Use of ICANN Name and Website. ICANN hereby grants to Registrar
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license during the Term of this
Agreement (a) to state that it is accredited by ICANN as a registrar for each
TLD that is the subject of an appendix to this Agreement and (b) to link to
pages and documents within the ICANN web site. No other use of ICANN's name or
website is licensed hereby. This license may not be assigned or sublicensed by
Registrar.
3.1 Obligations to Provide Registrar Services. During the Term of this
Agreement, Registrar agrees that it will operate as a registrar for each TLD
for which it is accredited by ICANN in accordance with this Agreement.
33.3 Another sub-clause referred by the learned Special Counsel is 3.3.6, same
is reproduced below:
3.3.6 In addition, Registrar shall provide third-party bulk access to the data
subject to public access under Subsection 3.3.1 under the following terms and
conditions:
3.3.6.1 Registrar shall make a complete electronic copy of the data available
at least one time per week for download by third parties who have entered into
a bulk access agreement with Registrar.
3.3.6.2 Registrar may charge an annual fee, not to exceed S$10,OOO, for such
bulk access to the data.
3.3.6.3 Registrar's access agreement shall require the third party to agree
not to use the data to allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission
bye-mail, telephone, or facsimile of mass, unsolicited, commercial advertising
or solicitations to entities other than such third party's own existing
customers.
3.3.6.4 Registrar's access agreement snail require the third party to agree
not to use the data to enable high-volume, automated, electronic processes
that send queries or data to the systems of any Registry Operator or ICANN-
Accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register domain names
or modify existing registrations.
3.3.6.5 Registrar's access agreement may require the third party to agree not
to sell or redistribute the data except insofar as it has been incorporated by

the extraction of a substantial portion of the bulk data' from the value-added
product or service for' use by other parties.
3.3.6.6 Registrar may enable Registered Name Holders who are individuals to
elect not to have Personal Data concerning their registrations available for
bulk access for marketing purposes based on Registrar's "Opt-Out" policy ,and
if Registrar has such a policy. Registrar shall require the third party to
abide by the terms of that Opt-Out policy; provided, however, that Registrar
may not use such data subject to opt-out for marketing purposes in its own
value- added product or service.
34\. Another important part of the agreement referred by the learned Special
Counsel is LOGO LICENSE APPENDIX. The relevant part is reproduced below:
REGISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT Registrar wishes to acquire from ICANN, and ICANN
wishes to grant to Registrar, a license to use the trademarks listed below the
signature block of this Logo License Appendix ("Trademarks") in connection
with Registrar's role as an ICANN-accredited registrar. Pursuant to and
subject to the Registrar Accreditation Agreement, Registrar and ICANN hereby
agree as follows:
LICENSE
1\. Grant of License. ICANN grants to Registrar a non-exclusive, worldwide
right and license to use the Trademarks, during the term of this appendix and
solely in connection with the provision and marketing of Registrar Services in
order to indicate that Registrar is accredited as a registrar of domain names
by ICANN. Except as provided in this subsection and Subsection 2.2 of the
Registrar Accreditation Agreement, Registrar shall not use the Trademarks, any
term, phrase, or design which is confusingly similar to the Trademarks or any
portion of the Trademarks in any manner whatsoever.
2\. Ownership of Trademarks. Any and all rights in the Trademarks that may be
acquired by Registrar shall inure to the benefit of, and are herby assigned
to, ICANN. Registrar shall not assert ownership of the Trademarks or any
associated goodwill.
3\. No Sublicense. Registrar shall not sublicense any of its rights under this
appendix to any other person or entity (including any of Registrars
resellers) without the prior written approval of ICANN.
REGISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
1\. Registration. Registration and any other form of protection for the
Trademarks shall only be obtained by ICANN in its name and at its expense.
2\. Enforcement. Registrar shall promptly notify ICANN of any actual or
suspected infringement of the Trademarks by third parties, including
Registrar's resellers or affiliates. ICANN shall have the sole discretion to
initiate and maintain any legal proceedings against such third parties;
Registrar shall not take any such actions without the prior written approval
of ICANN; and ICANN shall retain any and all recoveries from such actions.
3\. Further Assurances. Registrar agrees to execute such other documents and
to take all such actions as ICANN may request to effect the terms of this
appendix, including providing such materials (for example URLs and samples of
any promotional materials bearing the Trademarks), cooperation, and assistance
as may be reasonably required to assist ICANN in obtaining, maintaining, and
enforcing trademark registration(s) and any other form of protection for the
Trademarks.
TERM AND TERMINATION This Logo License Appendix shall be effective from the
date it is signed below by both parties until the Expiration Date, unless this
appendix or the Registrar Accreditation Agreement is earlier terminated. Each
party shall have the right to terminate this appendix at any time by giving
the other party written notice. Upon expiration or termination of this
appendix, Registrar shall immediately discontinue all use of the Trademarks.
35\. It would be seen from the above mentioned sub-clauses, ICANN Accredits
the appellant after identifying and setting minimum standards for the purpose
of registration functions. Further, Clause 2.2 permits the appellant to use a
symbol which indicates that ICANN has accredited the appellant. We have also
gone through and seen the said symbol which is reproduced below:
36\. From the mission and core values as also the agreement between ICANN and
the appellant we are not able to find out any service or a process for which
ICANN is associated and is being provided by the appellant. Appellants
provided registrar service and as per the powers under Article II of powers
for ICANN, ICANN is prohibited from acting as registrar. From the agreements
or from the bylaws, we are not able to find any process that has been
developed by the ICANN and being used by the appellants. We find what is being
done by the ICANN is to set minimum standards for the performance of
registration function and recognize that the appellants are meeting those
standards. Revenue has not been able to pinpoint to us either any service or
any process for which ICANN is known and that process is being used or being
provided by the appellants. In the absence of any such service or process we
are unable to agree with the Revenue that the appellants are providing
franchise service of ICANN. Even the agreement which permits the use of ICANN
symbols clearly indicates that appellants are ICANN Accredited Registrar and
nothing beyond that. We are in agreement with the appellants submission that
accreditation and representing the ICANN are two different things and the
appellants are only accredited by ICANN and they are not representing ICANN.
37\. Coming to the second agreement. That agreement is between the Registry
and Registrar, the learned Special Counsel referred to Clause 1.8, 2.5, 3.1 ,
4 and 5 of the said Agreement viz between VNDS (Registry) and
appellant/register). The said clauses are reproduced below for ready
reference:
1.8. The "Licensed Product" refers to the intellectual property required to
access the Supported Protocol, and to the APIs, and software, collectively.
2.5. License. Registrar grants VNDS as Registry a non-exclusive
nontransferable worldwide limited license to the data elements consisting of
the Registered Name, the IP addresses of name servers, and the identity of the
registering registrar for propagation of and the provision of authorized
access to the TLD zone files or as otherwise required or permitted by VNDSs
Registry Agreement with ICANN concerning the operation of the Registry TLD, as
may be amended from time to time.
3.1. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
VNDS hereby grants Registrar and Registrar accepts a non-exclusive,
nontransferable, worldwide limited license to use for the Term and purposes of
this Agreement the Licensed Product, as well as updates and redesigns thereof,
to provide domain name registration services in the Registry TLD only and for
no other purpose. The Licensed Product, as well as updates and redesigns
thereof, will enable Registrar to register domain names in the Registry TLD
with the Registry on behalf of its Registered Name Holders. Registrar, using
the Licensed Product, as well as updates and redesigns thereof, will be able
to invoke the following operations on the System: (i) check the availability
of a domain name, (ii) register a domain name, (iii) re-register a domain
name, (iv) cancel the registration of a domain name it has registered, (v)
update the nameservers of a domain name, (vi) transfer a domain name from
another registrar to itself with proper authorization, (vii) query a domain
name registration record, (viii) register a nameserver, (ix) update the IP
addresses of a nameserver, (x) delete a nameserver, (xi) query a nameserver,
and (xii) establish and end an authenticated session.
4\. SUPPORT SERVICES 4.1. Engineering Support. VNDS agrees to provide
Registrar with reasonable engineering telephone support (between the hours of
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST or at such other times as may be mutually agreed upon) to
address engineering issues arising in connection with Registrar's use of the
System.
4.2. Customer Service Support. During the Term of this Agreement, VNDS will
provide reasonable telephone and e-mail customer service support to Registrar,
not Registered Name Holder or prospective customers of Registrar, for
nontechnical issues solely relating to the System and its operation. VNDS will
provide Registrar with a telephone number and e-mail address for such support
during implementation of the Supported Protocol, APIs and Software. First-
level telephone support will be available on a 7-day/24-hour basis. VNDS will
provide a web-based customer service capability in the future and such web-
based support will become the primary method of customer service support to
Registrar at such time.
5.1. Registration Fees.
(a) Registrar agrees to pay VNDS the non-refundable fees set forth in Exhibit
D for initial and renewal registrations and other services provided by VNDS
(collectively, the "Registration Fees").
(b) VNDS reserves the right to adjust the Registration Fees, provided that any
price increase shall be made only upon six (6) months prior notice to
Registrar, and provided that such adjustments are consistent with VNDS's
Registry Agreement with ICANN.
(c) Registrars shall provide VNDS a payment security comprised of an
irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit account or other acceptable credit
terms agreed by the Parties (the Payment Security). VNDS will invoice
Registrar monthly in arrears for each month's Registration Fees. All
Registration Fees are due immediately upon receipt of VNDS's invoice and shall
be secured by the Payment Security. If Registrars Payment Security is
depleted, registration of domain names for the Registrar will be suspended and
new registrations will not be accepted until the Payment Security is
replenished.
38\. It has been alleged in the demand notice that the registries are
associate franchisor (of ICANN) and therefore the agreement between the
associate franchisor and the appellant is a franchisee agreement. It is
presumed that the registries are franchisees of the ICANN.
39\. We find that agreement between ICANN and Registry has not been produced
either by Revenue or the appellant. We find that Revenue have not been able to
bring on record any service or process identified with ICANN which is required
to be prohibited by various registries accredited by ICANN. It appears that
registries are also accredited like registrars. ICANN might have provided
minimum standards for registries but that does not imply that registries are
providing any service or process identified with ICANN. A reading of the above
mentioned agreement clearly indicates that this is an agreement between
registry and the appellant and has nothing to do with ICANN and under the
circumstances we are not able to persuade ourselves that the appellants are
providing franchise service of the associate franchisor of ICANN (i.e.
registries).
40\. Coming to the second Show Cause Notice, which is between the appellant
and reseller, the appellant have appointed a large number of resellers all
throughout the world who are required to sell the products and services of the
appellants.
41\. We have gone through the said Reseller Master Agreement as also the
Reseller Domain Registration Product Agreement Extension. Clause 1 (25) and 1
(4) in these are as under:
1 (25) ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
1 (4) ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
42\. First of all, we observe that the resellers are specifically prohibited
from using the name of ICANN. They only represent the appellant. In fact they
are reselling the services of registrar being provided by the appellant. After
selling the services of the registrar they remit the money to the appellant as
per the agreement. We find that the agreement is of a nature of principal to
principal basis and resellers cannot be considered as franchisee or associate
franchisor of ICANN.
43\. In fact, we have already held earlier that appellant cannot be considered
as a franchisee of ICANN and therefore resellers cannot be considered as
franchisee of the associate franchisor. In view of the above position, in our
view the Revenues contention that the resellers are providing the franchisee
services of the ICANN does not hold water. In view of the above analysis we do
not find any strength in the second demand notices also. Accordingly we hold
that no service tax is leviable under the franchise service and hence demand
and penalties are not sustainable.
44\. We also note that the appellant has raised certain other arguments.
However, since we are allowing the appeal on the merits, we do not consider it
necessary to go into other aspects.
45\. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

names. Any user who need to access a particular website, the users computer
would need to access information from the specific server. This can be done by
identifying each computer on the internet network with a unique identification
which is known as domain name. The domain name identifies the location of a
particular website on the network of millions of computer on the internet. As
an illustration www.google.com means that (i) www is the worldwide web (ii)
